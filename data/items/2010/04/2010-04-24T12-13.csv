I'm very weak on the details (I think the context of my learning about this was a presentation of a ""brilliant executive"" who will now share blah blah blah-- oh, by the way, she figured out how to do this for insurance companies).

Let me first state that it was not my intention to attack your language.<p>I didn't download or try the language to answer my questions (or read the rest of documentation) because I was just giving my opinion on the introductory guide, not on the language itself! In other words: I'm not saying your language sucks. I haven't formed an opinion on it yet.<p>Regarding bignums, for my programming languages I've settled on imath ( <a href=""http://spinning-yarns.org/michael/sw/imath/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spinning-yarns.org/michael/sw/imath/</a> ). It has a BSD compatible license, it's ANSI C, it's very fast and it has both bignum and bigdecimal support. It's also memory efficient for small numbers.<p>I'm happy to report that I'm working on hobby projects and my own startup all the time. Having a blast.

1290766,comment,1290303,1290705,0,0,10ren,,,"You're asking me to justify reading books that are recommended by someone I admire? Seems like such a trollish request! But I've liked some of your comments, so I'll try to answer straightforwardly.<p>I often read books for information, ideas of how to approach problems, and also for inspiration/motivation/reassurance/encouragement. That's what I hope to get.<p>Now, Drew is a very clear thinker, eg in his YC application., but obviously reading books that he's found valuable is not going to suddenly make me as clear as him - but it might help [I actually deleted that from my original comment because it seemed sort of irrelevant to the question].<p>Now, for these specific books, I've liked Steve Blank's blog, but if Drew has followed or used that book somewhat, that would be a significant recommendation. I have some doubts, because it seems to be a fact-driven approach, and sometimes the facts can't be ascertained - eg customers can't want something they can't imagine; you have to build it first and show it. (eg The Innovator's Dilemma). Drew mentions this in <i>people weren't actively looking for what we were making</i> and <i>'I didn't realize I needed this'</i> (#27,28). I also think that being too focused on specific questions can close your mind off from serendipity. But that's just my opinion.<p>I have to say that what Drew has done is just so cool: a new technology-based product that is revolutionary. The slides also have some of that magical sheen of founder folklore. Although my last software business supports me financially, the technology wasn't revolutionary and it didn't start a revolution in usage. I hope my present one will be closer to it (that would be awesome!). I do have a bit of a ""fan"" attitude to Drew's success; perhaps that's why you're requesting justification.",1272111683

Even if they didn't account for some infrastructure, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't decrease that number 500 times.<p>Nuclear fission is one of the most powerful energy sources (in energy per unit of mass of fuel) known to mankind, to be replaced only by fusion and annihilation.

4858391,comment,4857228,4858090,2,0,rmk2,,,"I'd imagine you'd be hard pressed to find a video of ""expert players"" playing D&D. And even if you did, I really doubt it would be overly thrilling to watch.<p>For what it's worth, RPGs are a rather specific thing, since they can only work if the given group works <i>as a group</i>. This form of gaming is a communal effort, a DM who doesn't adjust to what his players wish for will soon be without a group. Both the DM and the players are supposed to have <i>fun</i>. They might need some nudging here or there, but overall, they are just as much part of the process.<p>Most questions in any RPG forum I've ever seen center either around meta-gaming questions (rules and how to enforce/circumvent them) or about how to deal with situations that arise from a specific group constellation. If you have a group that likes the fighting but dislikes riddles, a DM avoiding juicy fights and drowning them in riddles does them a disservice. Most problems however arise from less homogenous groups, where some people fancy one thing while others would like to focus on others.<p>Ultimately, every group has to find out for itself what does work and does not work. Other people can give you hints, propose changes, improvements or overall just tell you about their experiences and how they deal with problems, in order for you to be able to compare their problems and solutions to your own.<p>[edit] Something like stackoverflow works in much the same way. The community can propose solutions to a specific question you put forward, based on their own experience and ideas, however, you will ultimately be responsible to figure out whether the proposed answers are right for you and your specific contexts and experiences.",1354384676

4858379,comment,4857929,4857929,1,0,breckinloggins,,,"It's fun to imagine the type of replicator a Type I civilization might be able to produce.  Imagine a machine that takes hydrogen and energy (or just energy) and builds, from the subatomic particles up, all the elements needed for production (just as stars do).  Then, using a combination of scaffolding, precise placement, and self-replicating nano-structures, creates any object, organic or otherwise.  Who knows, we may ultimately figure out how to manipulate a more fundamental physical substrate than just ""packets of energy orbiting each other"" and so create exotic but stable condensates and states of matter we can now only imagine.  This would be something akin to using the hypothetical ""quantum foam"" as a sculpting material.<p>Granted, this all requires physics that aren't currently understood and may not even exist, and the amount of energy required would be staggering, but a true ""anything replicator"" would surpass the Star Trek vision into something that needed no ""raw materials"" at all except energy.",1354384524

4858377,comment,4857854,4857854,5,0,sophacles,,,"It's funny that this turned up today. Last week I was browsing craigslist for quick side gigs, and came across a post of someone wanting a Django/python tutor. I pinged the person - and decided to help her out. The problem is: I am not comfortable taking money to help someone learn something, since I am not a professional tutor or teacher. Fortunately in this case she was also about to apply for a job at the university I work at, so payment for the tutoring couldn't happen at all (due to potential conflict of interest issues). So instead we worked out a deal where I will help her learn if some of her learning projects are stuff we need to do at my local hackerspace, and helps me with some of the pages I do as volunteer work for charities.<p>We were talking and have come to the conclusion that this arrangement might be somewhat scalable for learning - an apprentice model for coding, that benefits 3rd parties. It certainly gets around some of the weird power dynamics of traditional apprenticeship/mentoring and paid tutoring. Further it is a good way to get some needed talent to good non-profits that may not be able to otherwise arrange such a thing.<p>Finally, and this is the kicker - it gives novices practice in real development, and it gives experienced people (who may be hiring) access to people to see how they are at problem solving in a real environment, rather than interview tests, potentially faked code samples, etc. (Not to mention, someone willing to go through the effort of something like this is probably already a great candidate on the strength of ""wants to learn more and actually takes effort to do so"", which I have found to be a strong indicator for a good employee).<p>I don't know where you are located, but if you want to get into some more discussions about setting up something like I described above, feel free to email me:<p><pre><code>  $HNUSERNAME at gmail.</code></pre>",1354384504

4858372,comment,4857290,4857874,5,0,lambda,,,"But don't most machines that will be using CPUs that big have two sockets? Big servers these days come with 2 CPU sockets, 6 cores per CPU, 2 threads per code. So you do see 24 way parallelism pretty often, for server-side code at least.<p>Now, this was pretty much the low end of his original prediction: 'If we stick with ""just more of the same"" as in Figure 2's extrapolation, we'd expect aggressive early hardware adopters to be running 16-core machines (possibly double that if they're aggressive enough to run dual-CPU workstations with two sockets), and we'd likely expect most general mainstream users to have 4-, 8- or maybe a smattering of 16-core machines (accounting for the time for new chips to be adopted in the marketplace).'<p>It is true that new, mainstream systems offer 4 to 8 way parallelism, and that you see up to 24 way parallelism on the high end. So, his ""more of the same"" prediction was perfectly correct.<p>We did not see the large jump that he hypothesized might happen. But if you notice, he said ""But the gating factor is software that can use them effectively; specifically, the availability of scalable parallel mainstream killer applications. The only thing I can foresee that could prevent the widespread adoption of manycore mainstream systems in the next decade would be a complete failure to find and build some key parallel killer apps, ones that large numbers of people want and that work better with lots of cores.""<p>As you say, most programmers don't develop for these big many-core monstrosities. So he was right; software that takes advantage of multi-core machines is still a gating factor. The chips are available, but because that many cores does not help most software that hasn't been specially crafted for it, they are not mainstream.<p>I think the one major fault is in his optimism that it's possible for most software to take good advantage of that many cores. Parallelism is hard. Correct software is more important than fast software. Heck, a lot of software these days is written in languages like JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, which are not known for their speed, but rather their ease of development. Telling people to get with the multi-core bandwagon, when really just writing large, correct software is in most cases more important that squeezing out the last ounce of performance, is not exactly productive.<p>As GPUs have shown us, the best way to take advantage of that extra parallelism is to write special purpose libraries for the computationally intensive parts, and then just call out to that from simpler, less parallel code. So I'm not sure that the average programmer is going to spend that much time adapting their code for the parallel world, other than using existing libraries and frameworks for taking advantage of that.<p>A database backed web app is a great example of this kind of parallelism. The hard parts of parallelism are generally handled by the database itself. The web app is usually written completely single threaded, but you can spin up multiple processes all talking to the same database to take advantage of your multiple cores.<p>I suspect that is how we'll see parallelism play out in general. Most software written single threaded, with parallelism only by running multiple processes, talking to specially tailored databases, message queues, rendering libraries, numerical computing libraries, and the like.",1354384419

The Shadow has a piece of equipment called the T.A.L.S. (Tactical Automated Landing System). Landing a shadow (I did this in Iraq as well mind you) involved aligning the AV in a small box on the screen which turned it green. Provided the airspeed was right and crosswinds were in tolerance, you click the ""Land AV"" button and the landing is 100% hands off. If at any point during the tals auto-landing something looks off, you push the abort button which powers the engines to full, gains altitude, and lets you circle around to try again.

We’re growing quickly and so far have managed to finance our own growth with our profits, but we’re looking to fundraise soon.<p>There are 2 people on the core team, and we coordinate a team of freelance writers who create all the content which we then sell to our customers. At the moment we’re doing this all by hand, and we need a generalist-type full-stack engineer to give our company some much-needed tech muscle.<p>The thing we need short-term is a web application which allows for content (text + links + images) to be input by our employees and passed through a workflow chain which ends at our customers. The thing we need long-term is a mechanism which allows our customers to be intelligently paired up with employees who would be a good fit for them- and also uses analytics from Facebook + Twitter + anything else to help us learn more about how to provide our customers with awesome, effective, engaging content. This is going to involve a lot of iteration and that’s why we need a new core member of our team instead of an outsourced partner or contractor etc. This is a green-field proposition: you can work with whatever tech tools you like.

4858286,comment,4857053,4857159,5,0,gregsq,,,"In response to this, here is a summary copied directly from a reputable source. [1]<p>Thorium is a radioactive element similar to uranium. Formerly used to make gas mantles, it is about three times as abundant in the earth’s crust as uranium. Soil commonly contains around 6 parts per million of thorium, and some minerals contain 12% thorium oxide. Seawater contains little thorium, because thorium oxide is insoluble. Thorium can be completely burned up in simple reactors (in contrast to standard uranium reactors which use only about 1% of natural uranium). Thorium is used in nuclear reactors in India. If uranium ore runs low, thorium will probably become the dominant nuclear fuel.\nThorium reactors deliver 3.6 billion kWh of heat per ton of thorium, which implies that a 1 GW reactor requires about 6 tons of thorium per year, assuming its generators are 40% efficient. Worldwide thorium re- sources are estimated to total about 6 million tons, four times more than the known reserves shown in table 24.7. As with the uranium resources, it seems plausible that these thorium resources are an underestimate, since thorium prospecting is not highly valued today. If we assume, as with ura- nium, that these resources are used up over 1000 years and shared equally among 6 billion people, we find that the “sustainable” power thus gener- ated is 4 kWh/d per person.\nAn alternative nuclear reactor for thorium, the “energy amplifier” or “accelerator-driven system” proposed by Nobel laureate Carlo Rubbia and his colleagues would, they estimated, convert 6 million tons of thorium to 15 000 TWy of energy, or 60 kWh/d per person over 1000 years. Assuming conversion to electricity at 40% efficiency, this would deliver 24kWh/d per person for 1000 years. And the waste from the energy amplifier would be much less radioactive too. They argue that, in due course, many times more thorium would be economically extractable than the current 6 million tons. If their suggestion – 300 times more – is correct, then thorium and the energy amplifier could offer 120 kWh/d per person for 60 000 years.<p>[1] David MacKay. <a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/</a>",1354382707

Just one example but this might vary user to user.<p>Battery Life: this is a huuuge huge win for the Nexus 4. My Gnex would last until about 6pm with about 1.5 hours of screen time while with the Nexus 4 I go until midnight on over 2 hours of screen time (I say over because I've never put it back on the charger with less than 14% so far - also I play Ingress). I think anecdotally there are phones with even better battery life (razr maxx, iphone5, htc one x) but to say that Nexus 4 is a step down from the Gnex is absolutely false.<p>Here are a couple of things that I do like better on the Gnex:\nIt is more comfortable to hold. While the Nexus 4 looks a little sexier with the straight edges and flat black glass surfaces.. the Gnex was a little thinner and a little curvier in just the right places to ensure that my hand is not straining at all in order to hold it comfortably.<p>Buttons were more solidly built on the Gnex. The volume and power button on the N4 seem cheaper and squeakier than the Gnex. I imagine HTC and iPhones are even better in this regard.<p>I say accept your new phone and use. Then if you don't like it don't send it back but instead sell it back on Ebay. In the first few weeks of the N4 being available (or rather unavailable) people were making $50-$100 of profit on extra phones they bought by mistake from the Play store.",1354382136

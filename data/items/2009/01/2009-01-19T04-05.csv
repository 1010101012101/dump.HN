It's acceptable as an adjective, or as a mass noun if pluralized.<p>What should be the collective noun? How about an <i>incompetence</i> of enterprises?",1232340987

I'm probably just not used to coding on light backgrounds, since I haven't done it in a long while - if I did it for a few hours, I'd probably adjust.

I don't think you can use trademarked words like Django and Ruby on Rails in your trademark without violating the trademark of Django and RoR.

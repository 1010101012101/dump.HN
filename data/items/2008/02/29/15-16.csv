I've been working in Drupal recently, and the elegance of something like RSpec seems like a distant memory now.<p>My advice is to watch a few Peepcode screencasts (I gotta start collecting affiliate fees from that guy, I drop his name so much) and just pick a method and start. Don't get too obsessed with exactly which flavor of the testing religion you are adopting; play around with it a while. RSpec is as good a place to start as any, although you should obviously know enough about Test::Unit to read and recognize other people's vanilla unit tests.<p>I'd be sure to try autotest with whatever else you use, though, because it's fun to get the dynamic feedback.<p>You can learn way, way too much about Rails testing by reading Jay Fields' blog. There was also some useful stuff on the Thoughtbot blog, back when I was actually paying attention.",1204300797

126129,comment,125841,125919,0,0,dgabriel,,,"Ok, I work in Java all day.  I use a smattering of other languages, have developed a number of sites using PHP, and my pet project is in Python.<p>I don't think you know many java programmers, and it's clear you haven't done any real world java development.  Sure, the language has problems, and there are astronaut architects that do silly things, but neither I nor my coworkers rely on ""wizards,"" or are obsessed with factories.  Most of us use macs or linux.  You might have read a rant that described all java developers that way, but it's unfair.  There are VB and C# developers that fall into the same traps you describe.<p>In any case, if java is such an obviously terrible choice, why does a company like Google use it extensively internally?  Either you assume the dangers of being surrounded by morons at Google is high, or perhaps you add nuance to your assertions.",1204300055

126126,comment,126067,126067,0,0,ghiotion,,,"My issue with rails is one of tone.  There's something very off putting about the use of the word ""evangelist"" in the rails community.  Everyone I've spoken to who uses rails gets this far-away, misty-eyed look when they talk about the framework.  I love programming as much as the next guy, but there's nothing out there that inspires this kind of fanatical devotion in me.",1204299818

126122,comment,126067,126104,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Let me take my own medicine here.<p>Welcome! You are going to enjoy frameworks! They are really cool!<p>Those of us who don't have the time to try out so many new things would appreciate an essay on the subject of ""why I, as a brand-new user, found Rails so much more fun than Django or .Net"". If nothing else, it would be fun to have an iota of <i>actual evidence</i> that I can cite when I'm patting myself on the back for having chosen Ruby and Rails over the others.<p>Don't become cynical right away. The framework community is awash in cynics at the moment. There's a backlash, dontcha know, because folks are aghast that after <i>three whole years</i> of hard work Fred Brooks is still right: Rails and Django and CakePHP haven't made web programming as easy as sneezing. It's still just web programming. You type, and you type some more, and you get a brief glimpse of joy, and then you fire up IE 6.0, and you burst into tears. Some things never change.<p>See? Working too hard at the coal face can make me cynical too. So for god's sake have some fun and be proud of having fun. We could all use some enthusiasm!",1204299576

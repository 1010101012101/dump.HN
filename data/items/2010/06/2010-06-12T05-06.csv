1425613,comment,1424991,1425552,0,0,hammerdr,,,"We can theoretically impact it. Antimatter slowly falls into the black hole and decreases its mass until there isn't enough gravity to maintain a black hole (and then you have a massive explosion).<p>So, in theory, if we could somehow acquire antimatter and throw it at a black hole, we could 'evaporate' the black hole faster. We better run fast though :)<p>It's fascinating how this actually happens. There are twin particles of matter/anti-matter appearing and disappearing throughout the universe. They exist for only a fraction of a second. However, at the edge of a black hole, the matter is pushed away and the antimatter is sucked in. The matter is what creates the 'glow' of the black hole and the antimatter is just decreasing the mass of the black hole. So, evaporation is a bit of a misnomer because nothing is escaping.",1276320230

The single best factor is the ability to choose which data connection I want an app to use (ex. 3g, wifi, MSM data, etc).<p>There are 2 ""apps"" that are the main benefit. (1) Fring allows me to have video conference calls through skype (basically an early ""Facetime"", apple in no way is the first one to bring this to the mobile phone). (2) Joikuspot, which allows me to tether my 3G data to wifi. Any number of machines can use the wifi-hotspot that this creates.<p>Oh, and i like being able to push buttons.

I'm not sure there's a simple or even reasonable solution, but there's definitely a problem.<p>I know many smart, capable, enthusiastic people who have a very good business ideas, would be totally capable of launching a new product/service/etc., and would make fine entrepreneurs -- but who have absolutely no way to get their ideas/product/services off the ground.<p>Every time someone approaches me and asks for direction on how to fund the idea, the answer always seems to end up at ""find a wealthy friend or family member to invest in you.""  Some people have those connections.  Most do not.<p>We all know that VCs only go for very specific types of high-growth products / services.  Places like Y Combinator have a very specific (and great!) niche.  Banks are entirely useless in 95% of cases.

Another focus of Thrift (and Google's ""protocol buffers"", its inspiration) is that modifying your RPCs in a forward compatible way should be easy and have well defined semantics. (Thus the need for a tagged-base stream.) And, old clients should continue to handle new data in an acceptable manner. (i.e. They should not discard new fields that they do not know about.)<p>IMO Thrift/protobufs also add a lot of value having a single file to describe the shared protocol, compared to e.g. JSON, where it tends to be more ad-hoc or ""look at example results for reference.""",1276319238

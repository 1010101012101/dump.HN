Personally I fold the cardboard box and it fits nicely in my outdoor garbage can for paper (which is recycled), and I make sure the ice packs are re-used by giving them away[1]. So I only have to trash the foam (approximately 1x8 feet of foam every week).<p>* Quality: I am blown away by the quality of the meals. It is similar or better in taste to what is offered by a trendy restaurant rated 3½-4 stars on Yelp in my area (San Francisco). Even my wife would agree and she is a picky eater :) Yes sometimes I receive a lettuce or parsley that does not looks that great, but it is rare (<3-5% of the ingredients).<p>* Difficulty: I find the Blue Apron instructions <i>very</i> easy to follow, and I only had very basic cooking experience before (frying steaks, making rice and pasta, etc). I have never messed up the cooking of a single meal or found any one to be difficult. Just follow the instructions precisely and I believe anyone can do it.<p>[1] I accumulate 4 weeks&#x27;s worth of ice packs, then put them in a box on my doorstep and post them on Craigslist in the &quot;free stuff&quot; section - someone usually picks them up in the next 12-24 hours.",1411581533

Because I&#x27;m of the opinion the CPI isn&#x27;t perfect ... but compared to other CPI data points, its relatively accurate. The problem with the &quot;perfect, ideal&quot; idea is the fact that, frankly, no one ever tried to build it and graph it over time. Those that pretend they want that are just pushing an ideological agenda and drop large portions of the basket completely. The problem with the CPI is the qualitative analysis, by its nature, fundamentally imperfect. It is an opinion. That said, you can&#x27;t just drop categories and claim to be anything except a joke.<p>> So instead I will step back from this tangent. We got into CPI over disagreement on how much inflation there is, and I was arguing that there&#x27;s a lot of inflation because we went off the gold standard, and so that&#x27;s why factory jobs don&#x27;t pay $30/h anymore. You argued that I have it backwards and that everything was good in the 70s. You said it worsened in the 80s and asked me to explain how and I justified it by saying that&#x27;s when Neoliberal policies took over. What part of this do you disagree with?<p>It seems roughly right for what was said.<p>The reason factory jobs don&#x27;t pay $30/h is because of globalization [cheaper to produce goods in other countries], tax burden shifting from capital to labor [ <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-tax-rates?op=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-tax-rates?op=1</a> ], etc. That isn&#x27;t really a &quot;Neoliberal&quot; issue but more simply technological progress has allowed us to outsource more to cheaper labor countries.<p>I don&#x27;t care too much as long as people have a living wage [which is at least $10/hr] and the poor aren&#x27;t taxed heavily compared to historic norms.",1411581321

While I&#x27;ve only contributed to a couple open source projects and haven&#x27;t lead my own large ones, I completely agree. There&#x27;s more to submitting patches than writing the patch- understanding contribution guidelines (code style, documentation, testing), responding to feedback, etc, these are all extremely important in actually contributing to a project. And having even just that little patch merged in feels great when you&#x27;re starting out.<p>Plus, no one wants to make a big helpful functional contribution only to be thrown away because they weren&#x27;t aware of how the community operates. Small patches have a low risk as far as learning about how to contribute, even if the patch is rejected for whatever reason.<p>Though this seems somewhat obvious, it&#x27;s nice to have it stated and validated by  the leadership of one of the largest open source projects.",1411581277

8362960,comment,8362055,8362055,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Nice puff piece :-) The interesting bit is that if you&#x27;re going to be servicing a lot of machines, then even if it costs you more to build/acquire them, you can get back more in savings in operating them. This is called &quot;trading capex for opex.&quot; And while it takes a reasonably savvy CEO to &quot;get it&quot; the number of CEOs who just &quot;don&#x27;t get computers&quot; seems to be on the decline (at least in spaces that use a lot of computers).<p>In one way this also puts pressure on folks like Amazon since their margin on EC2 and other services is a mix of over-provisioning and opex savings, having other folks be able to do this is a win. Perhaps the saddest thing was talking with the HP &quot;Gen8&quot; folks (trying to sell me servers to replace my Supermicro ones) who don&#x27;t get this at all.

I guess my worries came from the fact that in my current company I don&#x27;t know of any of the 100s permanent devs that came from a contracting background, so I sort of raised flags for me. That could possibly be because contractors dont often go back to permanent roles, rather than them being undesirable for a permanent position.<p>Really good point on the Math&#x27;s side of the business. I am based in the UK, hence things like Health and Dental and very good and free, therefore no need for costly private insurance. Pensions, the same, although I would make arrangements myself to contribute to it privately also. Taxes and other deductions, I plan to hire a good accountant that can both ensure I have all my affairs in order as well as look after my financial interests. PTO/Instability is the only true financial downside I can see, however, for the latter (at least in UK) even if you are a contractor they need to give you 1-2weeks pay should they wish to terminate the contract early - which should keep me afloat while finding new work.<p>All that being said, I think the main difference between US and UK when it comes to permanent salaries is that the US has much higher base in average rates than when compared to the UK. Not to mention the buying power of that salary is order of magnitudes higher than over here. Therefore in a way, it seems more unlikely (if I were to be over there) to do contracting when balancing the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s of both options.<p>Thanks again for your words, and advice.",1411580246

It was old, but it still had something like 16 cores, 64 GB RAM, and 2 hard drives. As a college student with no money I thought this was pretty cool.

Bacteria and protists are quite good at promoting genetic diversity through horizontal gene transfer, and viral infection with natural DNA replication error rates provide enough sources of &quot;random&quot; genetic variation to keep a diverse gene pool. One can think of competition to share genetic material as a primordial form of sexual selection. Getting from this kind of competition to orchestrated sharing and cross over of large genomes is a huge jump. The real question may be, did increasing organismal complexity necessitate a different type of reproduction to maintain genetic diversity? The answer to this may be yes, but alternative, less sexy hypotheses have to be tested as well. Another question to answer would be – What evolved first: multicellularity or sexual reproduction?",1411579033

My personal preference is runit[1], which is based on djb&#x27;s daemontools[2] and gives you all the dependency management and speed gains of systemd without the monolithic architecture and without the complicated shell scripts of sysvinit, as well as cool features like service management trees for non-root users.

It just happens to make a nice init.)<p>The tests I&#x27;ve seen show that a minimal system with runit boots roughly as fast as than a minimal system with systemd. That doesn&#x27;t mean runit is the end-all solution to &quot;which init&quot;—it&#x27;s perfect for my needs, but maybe not yours—but it <i>does</i> mean that the choice is not a choice between systemd-but-fast versus sysvinit-but-slow.

In a week or two we&#x27;ll travel up to Canada for a week. Where in Canada? Umm, British Columbia, maybe over to Alberta. What do we plan to see? I have no idea. Lots of provincial parks, I imagine. I have a very loose route planned, which we&#x27;ll probably abandon by Day 2, and that&#x27;s about it. Getting late in the year, might hit snow in higher areas, in which case we&#x27;ll turn back. We have to be home the following Monday. That&#x27;s our itinerary.<p>Semi-randomly wandering around isn&#x27;t for everyone. Despite the loose plan, there&#x27;s still planning to be done, either at the supper table in the evening or a map and breakfast in the morning. If you don&#x27;t like to think during your traveling, it&#x27;s definitely not for you what with ad hoc planning and a dozen off-the-cuff decisions throughout the day.<p>But you know what? One will often see and experience things because they&#x27;re worth seeing or experiencing, not because you&#x27;re <i>told</i> to go see them. I&#x27;m as much about the random roadhouse diner with an owner who can tell you the history of the area going back the four generations his family has lived there as I am about seeing the Grand Canyon (which is a bit overrated, IMO).<p>One of these days maybe we&#x27;ll do a cruise where every minute is planned. But not for a while, if ever.",1411578105

Teachers give the same content over and over again and do not memorize (in the sense of repeating it until it&#x27;s memorized). Great presenters do not memorize their speeches. They practice it until it&#x27;s natural.<p>I agree that content is king, but the one reason why we attend to classes, events and speeches is to see a great delivery of the content being presented. If not, better handle the written version by email and be done with it.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Steve Jobs wouldn&#x27;t be remembered by his presentation skills if he read the whole thing. That&#x27;s also not the reason why I remember my physics teacher from 10 years ago.",1411578099

It&#x27;s not obvious at a glance what&#x27;s happening because most peoples&#x27; eyes expect to see a for, or a do, or a while when they&#x27;re trying to spot a loop.<p>It&#x27;s also bad because you&#x27;re effectively lying to the interpreter. Suppose a future optimization involves some super efficient loop unrolling or such. Well, too bad: because you&#x27;ve hand-rolled your own looping construct, the compiler probably won&#x27;t be able to use it.<p>In general, just write idiomatic code that other programmers can readily work with. If (and only if!) a profiler identifies a problem, tweak just that part of the code. Leave liberal comments about what and why you did so that future programmers can evaluate whether your trickery is still worthwhile.",1411578073

People very much use them wrong imho; guys pay 0 attention to their profile besides their pic and just mail every face they like and women  pay attention to their profile and read the ones the guys put up. So they will never match. Both sides lie and the least attention they pay to their own profiles, the more lies are in them as they don&#x27;t see it as anything to worry about. The most successful ones are when guys pay a lot of attention and are honest (about yes they get hammered every weekend and they want girls who smoke and hate children; things which don&#x27;t make you popular maybe, but if it&#x27;s so, it&#x27;s so), don&#x27;t mail just everyone (and copy/paste the same; &#x27;hi you are cute, here is my number&#x27;) and take their time before trying to squeeze out as many &#x27;real life&#x27; dates (and sex) as possible.<p>Obviously there is room for both and both work, but we talked to many people, guys and girls in that time and in the end they want something real; most people on dating sites are just doing it wrong; it&#x27;s not the dating site. We ended up selling &#x27;profile help&#x27; where we would sit down and talk to (both sexes) and fix up their profiles and their communication. It seems obvious to people here (well ...) that if you meet in a bar later in the evening after one message online and jump in bed that night you&#x27;ll <i>probably</i> won&#x27;t be moving in soon and more than often actually stuff gets stolen that way as well (from phones to TVs to cars...). By keeping it online for a while with someone you not only learn a lot about eachother, but you weed out the perverts, criminals, sex addicts etc. Unfortunately, people are impatient and generally for some reason, lose all common sense when it comes to online dating.",1405421936

LibreSSL already breaks compatibility with OpenSSL in areas like FIPS compliance. Compatibility with broken applications is another &quot;feature&quot; that would be best to remove.<p>> Strawman. munmap() on random addresses is not something I have seen. Looping over all file descriptors and closing is something I have seen in lots of code. Code that works fine unless someone introduces a breaking change like suddenly holding onto a file descriptor the library previously didn&#x27;t.<p>There is no fundamental difference between a library-internal resource that happens to be a memory mapping and one that happens to be a file descriptor. Are you claiming that no libraries in the future should be able to use internal file descriptors because there are a few broken applications out there that like to go on close(2)-sprees?<p>If that level of compatibility is important to you, do what Microsoft did and implement appcompat shims. Did you know the Windows heap code has modes designed specifically for applications that corrupt the heap?<p>If you&#x27;re not prepared to go down that road, please recognize that broken behavior is not guaranteed to work forever. There was a time when use-after-free was a very common pattern: on a single-thread system, why <i>not</i> use a piece of memory after free but before the next malloc? That pattern had to be beaten out of software in order to allow progress to be made. As it was then with memory, now it is again with indiscriminate file descriptor closing.<p>> There is: [proper error plumbing] would mean LibreSSL does not work as a drop-in replacement for OpenSSL<p>This claim is simply untrue. The OpenSSL API has a rich error-reporting interface. No compatibility break is required for reporting entropy-gathering failures. The only needed changes are inside LibreSSL, and its developers appear to be refusing to make these changes.<p>> for me, it&#x27;s a matter of a basic principle<p>Another basic principle is that you can&#x27;t get very far if you assume <i>everything</i> can fail. You have to have a certain axiomatic base. The ability to have private resources in a library is a perfectly reasonable basic assumption.",1405421536

They&#x27;ve chosen this avenue for now, with a <i>large</i> comment in the source making it clear that this is in part a statement about their belief that the best solution would be for Linux to <i>keep</i> a safe API to obtain entropy.<p>Note that this is even code that will <i>never</i> be executed when running on a current mainline kernel. It will break on systems where people have been overzealous about disabling sysctl(), or on systems moving to some future mainline kernel which we don&#x27;t know when will be released.<p>> The problems you highlight are not things libraries should try to work around. They&#x27;re systemic issues. Libraries calling raise(SIGKILL) because their authors don&#x27;t believe systems have sufficiently secured their core file generation is absurd<p>It&#x27;s not absurd when we <i>know for a fact</i> that this often happens and is a common source of security breeches.<p>For systems where this is not an issue, disabling the fallback is a define away for your friendly distro packager.<p>> and only makes the problem worse because it makes overall system operation less predictable. (Imagine a poor system administrator trying to figure out why his programs occasionally commit suicide with no log message or core file.)<p>I&#x27;d rather be the system administrator trying to figure this out, than the system administrator that doesn&#x27;t know that various data found in my core files have been leaked to an attacker.<p>It will also only happen if: /dev/urandom is inaccessible <i>and</i> you&#x27;re running on a kernel without sysctl() <i>and</i> you&#x27;ve chosen this alternative over the built in fallback entropy source.<p>> These are not problems that require system-level fixes. They&#x27;re problems that require changes from LibreSSL.<p>They&#x27;re problems that may not be possible to fix for LibreSSL without failing to meet one of it&#x27;s main near-term goals of being a drop-in replacement for OpenSSL.<p>This is also likely to not only be a problem for LibreSSL - to me it raises the question of how many applications blindly assumes /dev/urandom will always be available and readable. It <i>is</i> a system-level problem when every application that wants entropy needs to carefully consider how to do it to avoid creating new security holes, when the solution simply is to retain a capability that is currently there (the sysctl() avenue) or implementing getentropy().<p>We&#x27;re not likely to agree on this, ever. We&#x27;re going in circles now, and just reiterating largely the same argument from different angles.<p>I won&#x27;t comment any more on this, other than saying that for me, it&#x27;s a matter of a basic principle: Assume everything will fail, and think about how to be the most secure possible in this scenario. To me, that makes the decisions the LibreSSL developers the seemingly only sane choice in a bad situation <i>assuming the constraint of sticking to the OpenSSL API</i>. Long term I think they ought to clean up the API too, but short term I think we&#x27;d get far more benefit out of them making it possible to safely replace OpenSSL first. And that may require sub-optimal choices to deal with the worst case scenarios, but then so be it.",1405420670

LibreSSL shouldn&#x27;t repeat that mistake. LibreSSL does have ways to report allocation failure errors to callers. It shouldn&#x27;t even try to work around problems arising from applications corrupting the state of components that happen to share the same process. That task is hopeless and leads to code paths that are very difficult to analyze and test. You&#x27;re more likely to create an exploitable bug by trying to cope with corruption than actually solve a problem --- and closing file descriptors other components own is definitely a form of corruption.<p>> [LibreSSL has] no control over whether or not [abort] will result in an insecurely written core file<p>The security of core files simply isn&#x27;t LibreSSL&#x27;s business. The mere presence of LibreSSL in a process does not indicate that a process contains sensitive information. LibreSSL has no right to replace system logic for abort diagnostics. If the developers believe that abort() shouldn&#x27;t write core files for all programs or some programs or some programs in certain states, they should implement that behavior on their own systems. They shouldn&#x27;t try to make that decision for other systems. LibreSSL&#x27;s behavior here is not only harmful, but insufficient, as the library can&#x27;t do anything about <i>other</i> calls to abort, or actual crashes, in the same process.<p>> I&#x27;ve seen it in plenty of code that did not go on to exec, to e.g. drop privileges for portion of the code.<p>Please name a program that acts this way.",1405419198

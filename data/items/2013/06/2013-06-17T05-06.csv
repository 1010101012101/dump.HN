In hindisight, despite the huge amounts of problems the Chinese society has (some of which are truly scary and may become emblems of future times), it cannot be denied that it is a country that has had a streak of massive, incredible growth and has hoisted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. This does not contradict the fact that the same government had such massive failures in the past.<p>I abhor the current Chinese state, but I really, <i>really</i> doubt that Western Capitalism would have been half as effective, at the very least not without costing the Chinese a huge relinquishment of capital and corporations in the hands of foreign interests, not a favorable position to be in.

The fact is, I think everyone would expect that everyone keeps track of everyone&#x27;s diplomats.  That&#x27;s just the way the world works.  Additionally, hacking into network backbones in China?  Is there anybody out there that was aware of the NSA&#x27;s activities over the last few decades that doesn&#x27;t immediately <i>assume</i> that they do?  Or is this news to those who didn&#x27;t read about the NSA tapping into undersea cables back in the 1990&#x27;s?<p>In other words, the details Snowden has given are largely harmless affirmations of what everyone probably knows already.  They don&#x27;t cause significant harm to our diplomatic relations.  They don&#x27;t cause significant harm to our intelligence.<p>I suspect given his moves so far, he agrees with my assessment above, so the question is, what is he doing with them?  I don&#x27;t think that is a hard question to answer.  He&#x27;s making public what those in power have assumed is the case for a long time in order to send signals to all sides that he knows a lot more than he is saying.  In essence he&#x27;s upping the ante regarding any indictment and extradition request.<p>He&#x27;s sending a threat to the US:  <i>Try to extradite me and maybe I will spill your secrets, real ones, not the ones hidden in plain view I have been talking about so far.</i><p>He&#x27;s also sending a message to China:  <i>I know enough to be valuable.</i><p>Time will tell what happens.

I have done some of this for Efficito (<a href=""http://www.efficito.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.efficito.com</a>).  Even with the best of care there are ways an administrator can get the info no matter what you do.  All you really can do is restrict it to ensure that casual access is not an issue.<p>For example, we store virtual machine root passwords in an encrypted database for last resort purposes (so that someone can log in using virsh console as root when nothing else is working).  There are three layers of encryption and as far as casual access goes (assuming nothing is reconfigured), mere root access to the box is not enough to reveal the information.  However if you can change what is logged by PostgreSQL and reconfigure PostgreSQL&#x27;s authentication options you could grab enough information to effectively read this data.<p>People with the sort of access required to make sure things are secure can effectively get the data off the system that they want, and the alternative in designing a system is to have one with no superusers and the possibility that information is irrevokably lost when someone forgets a password.

I think the bottleneck was (is?) the speed of AMBA bus[0] connecting the peripherals (including RAM controller) and the ARM core.<p>* A15 has a vastly more advanced pipeline and multiple-issue capabilities than A8. This should allow it to use its functional units more efficiently.<p>* Finally, my A15 system is running at 1.7 GHz compared to 1 GHz for the A8 system.<p>> I&#x27;m guessing you ran a very trivial benchmark that operated mostly out of the L1/L2 cache<p>The buffers were pre-initialized (to remove the kernel&#x27;s lazy physical memory allocation as a factor), and far larger than the L2. The data caches were explicitly flushed at the beginning. But indeed it was a very simple benchmark since it was a microbenchmark meant to measure memory bandwidth.<p>> Depending on what operating system you ran on the different boards, there could also be major differences in the kernel&#x27;s implementation of the DMA peripheral.<p>I wasn&#x27;t using DMA.<p>> For example, in the Github link, some code used native memcpys while others used kernel call memcpys.<p>To clarify: the project I&#x27;ve linked isn&#x27;t mine, it&#x27;s a public project that supported my point. But as far as I&#x27;m aware there&#x27;s no memcpy systemcall. memcpy is implemented completely in libc. For example, glibc has multiple optimized implementations written in assembly[1].<p>But you&#x27;re right, the glibc version is different between these computers, so I need to repeat with a statically compiled benchmark.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve looked at this while trying to improve memcpy speed for A15, which is why I don&#x27;t have solid comparative results. But I&#x27;m doing a write-up and now I&#x27;ll probably also include this bit.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Microcontroller_Bus_Architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Microcontroller_Bus_A...</a>

When someone mentions Tier 3 in China, those are cities that are considered big enough to warrant calling a city, but too numerous to know all of them off the top of your head. A Tier 1 city for an American is like NYC, San Francisco, Seattle, <i>etc.</i> For a resident of the UK, Tier 1 = London; France = Paris; you get the idea.<p>But here is the catch. In America, a Tier 3 city can be in a top-100 list by population, but still be relatively ho-hum and if not unknown, not exactly in the headlines every day. Take the smallest 10 cities in a top-100 list, like Chula Vista, CA, and arbitrarily draw the line for Tier 3 there. These cities barely crack 200,000 in population. In China, I found out Tier 3 &quot;ho-hum&quot; cities (rank 90-100 by population) have no fewer than 600,000 population. That blew my mind when I learned that, and put China&#x27;s rural-to-city migration into perspective.<p>Now consider this young work force migrating en masse to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities due to pricing pressures in Tier 1 cities. If they have a critical mass of the right entrepreneurial factors in place, that&#x27;s like over 100 Austin, TX (the brightest growth story the US can point to at the moment) popping up nearly simultaneously within the next 5-10 years.

5891545,comment,5889211,5891239,16,0,potatolicious,,,"&quot;Upgrade the system to support more trains&quot; is easier said than done.<p>For one thing, BART is running ancient rolling stock that&#x27;s already <i>well</i> pasts its original designed service lifetime - the bulk of the fleet is now <i>sixteen years</i> over its original 25-year service life. The system breaks down frequently because of this, and over the years the system has lost enough cars (and cannibalized enough for parts) that there is no longer sufficient spare capacity to rotate into service when trains break down.<p>Couple that with track and control design that does not permit bypasses, and you&#x27;ve got yourself a recipe for trouble. A train stuck in the tube cannot be bypassed - unlike other subway systems - and thus every single minor trouble cascades into a major cockup of everyone&#x27;s day.<p>So you have a system that is prone to magnifying small failures into big ones, <i>and</i> you combine that with trains that are <i>way</i> past their service life and running on proverbial fumes.<p>Bonus also: BART hasn&#x27;t purchased <i>any</i> new rolling stock in a very, very long time, and <i>all</i> of its rolling stock will come up to the end of their service lifetimes by 2019 (with 65% of the fleet <i>already past</i> service life). Instead of spreading the capital cost of new vehicles over decades, BART is now placed in a position where it needs to replace its 670+ car fleet in the span of about six years. In all likelihood this will mean even <i>more</i> of the fleet going into &quot;beyond service life&quot; territory and wreaking havoc on everyone&#x27;s commute.<p>BART can be improved. But before BART can be improved you first need to catch up on 20 years of complete neglect. It&#x27;s billions of dollars that has no hope of ever getting spent in the current political and economic climate, and that&#x27;s just to get BART to the point where it&#x27;s reasonably good at accomplishing its <i>current</i> stated purpose. At <i>that</i> point you can think about expanding the system, increasing capacity beyond its current scope, etc etc.<p>Actually, I just looked this up, the current plan is to phase in new vehicles beginning 2017, over a 15-20 year period. That&#x27;s going to be quite a treat, considering even the <i>newest</i> trains in the current fleet will be <i>44</i> years old by the time BART is done with their rolling stock refresh - 18 years past its expected service life.<p>Bonus also: large parts of BART track are actually substantially damaged, reducing speed and increasing noise (to unsafe levels, even). You can&#x27;t hope to begin adding capacity until you fix this. Between the fleet, the antiquated control systems, and damaged track, BART doesn&#x27;t need minor fixes, it needs deep overhauls of nearly every aspect of its infrastructure.<p>MUNI isn&#x27;t much better off: <a href=""http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/report-on-munis-light-rail-trains-is-latest-bad-news-for-agency/Content?oid=2350167"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/report-on-munis-light...</a><p>Ancient equipment, ancient infrastructure, a fleet stretched thin to the breaking point, decades of under-funding and mismanagement, all of these descriptors apply just as much to MUNI (if not more) than to BART.<p>The regional and city transportation infrastructure in the SF Bay Area is a complete mess. This is, unfortunately, not hyperbole. We are over a decade, and <i>billions</i> of dollars of additional spending, away from even <i>restoring</i> these transit systems to proper function, much less go after expanding their scope.",1371445686

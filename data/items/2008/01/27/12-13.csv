Bookmarking is a very real problem for me and I wouldn't mind paying, say, $10 a year for a good tool. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell your tool won't solve the problem. Atleast that's what I can tell without being able to try it.",1201438570

Also is there not laws in the US to make this a punishable offence?, I know in the UK they could of been up in court for it.<p>Looks like this guy could be Nascars Lewis Hamilton and not because of colour but because he has talent. good luck to him.",1201438559

104952,comment,103725,104706,0,0,ralph,,,"The example was using awk to pick ""Dec"" out in the month column whilst pointing out a grep for ""Dec"" would also match the filename ""December<i>"" which didn't have ""Dec"" in the month column.  awk's clearly better than grep in this case.<p>It's not hard to count the column and you can always do a<p><pre><code>    ... | awk '{print $6}' | sort | uniq -c\n</code></pre>\nto see if you've got it right.  In fact, a common way to develope the pipeline for a one-off task is to keep appending a pipe and another command to the previous pipeline command.  That way, you can see a sample of what's being produced instead of imagining it.<p>You couldn't have analysed the results of grep, discarding the non-month matches of ""Dec"" in the time taken to count up to field 6 if the number of lines was at all significant.  Don't be silly.<p>If I did miscount and no lines matched I may be suspicious and look more closely.  If some lines matched but on a different column than intended I may notice.  I can re-run the command after correction or try the {print $6} idea.  How would you notice if your </i>manual* analysis failed to spot the extra result from grep here and there.  Would you do your manual analysis twice?  Ask someone else to do it too?  Or just think ""good enough"" and use the data for the next stage?",1201436405

I understand the idea behind wanting to do something other than a blog, since every company has one these days, but video isn't the right answer for me.",1201435296

(We at Buxfer also do it, but it's tucked inside the site for users who really want to do it.) If Gmail and Yahoo were to open up even more and provide secure access to the addressbooks, nobody would have to do this stupid scraping anymore. ",1187058753

Having some random on USENET tell me, ""you're clueless; go study some introductory texts and don't write another line of code until you have"" isn't going to get me to do so even if I'm not sure if he's wrong.  Why didn't he just recommend a more appropriate database schema, accompanied by a suggestion that the OP read the Wikipedia page on normalization theory and try to keep his databases in 3NF?",1187058300

8765783,story,,,3,4,rhopen,"Should I build a personal finance site for engineers?",,"Before I transform my live financial education class to an online product, I&#x27;m trying to determine if engineers would use an online product that helps them develop a financial plan.  The plan lays out timeline to pay debts, improve credit score, budget expenses, save money, and build wealth through owning rental properties (property managed by third party).  We&#x27;re doing this successfully now, but want to scale it online.  I think engineers would be a terrific initial segment.  Am I right or wrong?",1418871482

Fast food burgers and white bread are not expensive here in Japan, but fresh fruits and vegetables are.<p>I think there are many factors, but the pretty great universal health care system has to be a big one. As a working adult in Tokyo, I receive tons of preventative care and thorough annual check ups. It&#x27;s cheap, and virtually all health care for my kids is completely free until they turn 15.<p>The lack of equal access to health care in the USA is almost certainly a reason that poor people die 5 years earlier than affluent people[1]. I would guess good access to health care is a big reason that Cuba does so well on that front, despite its obvious economic obstacles.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.rice.edu/2012/06/21/poorer-us-citizens-live-five-years-less-than-affluent-countrymen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.rice.edu/2012/06/21/poorer-us-citizens-live-five...</a>",1418871477

I don&#x27;t think you can compare it to to showing apartments. \nThere is not much skill required or education to be a rental agent (a few weeks of school and written exam, like a driving test). If you can operate the camera on a mobile device, post an ad on craigslist, and open a door lock - you are in business.<p>My argument is that renting out an apartment in Manhattan is similar to selling the latest iPhones as soon as they hit store shelves. The product sells itself because of the high demand and limited supply. The skill of the salesperson at the Apple store is not very relevant, which is why they are compensated hourly and not on commission.",1418871098

The kernel error messages continued until 22:19:23 when I killed the job, but nothing further got written to the DB in that intervening hour (based on looking at the filesize, which admittedly may not tell the whole story). The job stats were set to output once per 200,000 ops.

8765713,comment,8765567,8765567,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>Oakland, too, had a choice when the banks came for those foreclosed homes. It chose not to act while thousands of the city’s most vulnerable residents were pushed out of their homes.</i><p>What choice was this, exactly? If it was to withhold assistance from banks seeking to foreclose, as the tone suggests, then that&#x27;s flat-out wrong - evictions are legal actions that take place at the county level and are enforced by county sheriffs, and Alameda county is an awful lot bigger than Oakland - it&#x27;s over 800 square miles, more than 10x the size of Oakland. Maybe the author meant the city could have approved more affordable housing development projects within its boundaries? My experience from attending planning committee meetings is that virtually any kind of development, large or small, is met with a storm of objections from local neighbors, and the planning committee seems to have an inordinate fondness for micromanagement, going so far as to specify paint choices on large buildings in pursuit of aesthetic harmony. Some of this is in response to California&#x27;s poorly-written and seriously overbroad environmental quality law (CEQA) which allows people to file lawsuits over virtually anything.<p>This article has its heart in the right place (in terms of wanting to see the best outcome for the greatest possible number of people) but its factual grounding is rather poor.<p>Another example is the claim that there&#x27;s no supermarket in West Oakland, and people must make the trek to the neighboring municipality of Emeryville. Well, this is technically true, but when you look at the map you can see that Emeryville juts into the center of West Oakland. Going there to get groceries does not strike me as such a big deal because it&#x27;s only about 20-30 minutes&#x27; walk from any residential neighborhood in West Oakland - I know this because it&#x27;s <i>my</i> nearest supermarket, and I bring my groceries home in one of those fold-up shopping carts when I go there as neither my wife nor I like to drive and so we don&#x27;t have a car. West Oakland is also well-served by public transport, including a free shuttle-bus operated by the Emeryville business community that runs from that shopping center to MacArthur BART station in Oakland. People who don&#x27;t want to shop there also have the option of a smaller Trader Joe&#x27;s (also technically in Emeryville, but about 1/2 mile closer to the center of West Oakland) or taking BART one stop and going to the Smart&#x27;n&#x27;Final in Downtown Oakland (an area that&#x27;s much more accessibly from West Oakland than from where I live, farther north). The main downside of not having a supermarket in this part of Western Oakland (there are many others in other parts of the city) is that the sales tax revenue goes to Emeryville rather than Oakland - but then Emeryville also shoulders the burden of keeping up the roads around that busy shopping park, and so forth.<p>In practice, the municipal location of the supermarket is irrelevant - it&#x27;s not like they check people&#x27;s passports, and living only a few blocks from the Oakland/Emeryville border I can assure you that there isn&#x27;t any big sociopolitical discontinuity when you cross the street from one to the other. The only big difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that there seems to be a larger number of apartment buildings in Emeryville, and construction permits and development projects seem to get approved faster there (possibly because it&#x27;s smaller, and also because development is less politicized there).",1418869886

In fact, one factor that&#x27;s done more to mitigate the evils of human nature than almost anything else is Christianity, which is roundly vilified in this essay. Like anything else related to humans, Christianity has been affected by basic human nature, but &quot;love your brother as yourself&quot; is hard to attack really.<p>The bottom line is that Western civilization was first to break through to some transformative technologies: deep water sailing ships, good navigation, accurate timekeeping, and effective, mass produced, metal weapons. Given human nature, a culture with such advantages was sure to dominate. As the article tangentially points out, every culture has committed horrendous atrocities. Was the spread of Western culture really to blame for the brutal atrocities committed by the xenophobic Japanese during World War II? Attila the Hun? No, it was simply mostly unrestrained human nature.<p>Capitalism is also as effective as it is due to the fact that it dovetails nicely with human nature. It has lead to amazing advances, and a very high standard of living for even the poorest in the West - and soon throughout the rest of the world. It is to be applauded, not condemned.",1418868820

I have difficulties in drawing any conclusions about Venus as I can&#x27;t think of anything where 3 hours of human time would make a difference, so I used Mars (and to a lessor extent Rosetta) as the comparisons.<p>I researched various proposed Venus landings, like VISE, but still struggle to find something where a human in the near proximity would make that big of a difference.<p>That is, assuming landing can wait until Earth and Venus are at conjunction, and that 7° of angular separation is enough for a good single, then they are about 38 million kilometers apart, or 2.2 light minutes, so there&#x27;s a 4.5 minute lag for ground control on Earth. Compare to Mars, which at best is 54.6 million km from Earth, or 3 light minutes, giving a 6 minute lag.<p>So I can only assume you&#x27;re talking about driving a rover, which would require a lot of feedback. But a rover can&#x27;t go far in a couple of hours, and if it&#x27;s traveling the entire time then it&#x27;s not drilling or taking spectrographs .. neither of which require much decision making.<p>Instead, the blue sky plans are for things like the Landsailing Rover, which use passive wind power to move around. And unlike Mars, it seems that Venus doesn&#x27;t require much in the way of navigation, with little in the way of geography,  so autonomous systems might be fine for most travel.<p>Really, I struggle your proposal, so I&#x27;m trying to give real-world comparisons so I&#x27;m not just blabbling negativity on the internet. But do you have any examples of where the science is worth the cost of putting a human on the scene, compared to spending the same amount of money on multiple robotic probes? Because if it means putting 1 rover on Venus for 3 hours or sending 20 probes for multi-year missions to orbit around all of the other planets, plus 3 rovers on the Moon, then I can&#x27;t see how the human-near-Venus rover mission is worthwhile.",1418868190

Out in the real world, the US can (and probably will) pretty much just swap out the plaque outside the &quot;US Interests Section&quot; with one that says &quot;US Embassy&quot;, with the chief and their assistants magically transformed into diplomats.",1418868110

Interviewers were far more interested in things like side projects I did for fun or how well I whiteboarded than my education.<p>So your real hurdle (assuming you&#x27;re at the skill level of an entry-level/junior developer) is landing interviews. If you&#x27;re not interested in going back to school I&#x27;d suggest reaching out to recruiters. Work with several, try not to be too picky, and most importantly, be patient. With an unconventional background getting your first offer will not be easy - but after that you&#x27;re set. [Or at least, that was my experience, your mileage may vary].<p>Lastly, you mentioned you picked up PHP & SQL for a personal project - make sure that&#x27;s on your resume and make sure to bring it up in <i>every</i> interview you have. It shows a genuine interest both in writing software and in learning as well as demonstrate you&#x27;re capable of learning outside of a classroom.",1418868048

On the other hand, they&#x27;re often the butt of jokes in the west. Just look at all the &quot;you&#x27;ve been banned from r/pyongyang jokes on reddit. Or &#x27;The Interview&#x27; itself, which based on the trailer, seems to be laughing at the same stereotypes. I think a bunch of hackers that frequent 4chan have a lot more motive to continue this whole joke than North Korea itself.",1418868016

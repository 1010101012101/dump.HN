Let&#x27;s assume that:<p>a) Most &quot;good&quot; contributors write comments of varying quality (maybe on average 90% good 10% not so good)<p>b) Most people, when they interrupt their work flow to participate in the HN community, write on average more than one comment (if they comment at all).<p>So inevitably, the average user will repeatedly bump into the &quot;can&#x27;t comment, have to wait&quot; wall. Which is inconvenient and constitutes a blunt reminder of the &quot;value asymmetry&quot; between the site and the lowly user.<p>I&#x27;d say it is fairly reasonable to assume that being stopped and having to wait is rather off-putting to most HN users.

The lack of Linux operational training to the personnel along with replacement costs may call for an early demise to the plan to switch to Linux.

Replacement of MS Office with Libre/Open Office suite itself is a big hurdle which in terms of usability is still in its early days. In addition, most systems on government offices I&#x27;ve seen run IE8 as their primary browsers, running applications &quot;designed for IE only&quot;.

And on the other hand, lots of `algorithmic problems&#x27; fall into place naturally, once you have the right data structure.<p>> My point is simply that I feel comfortable creating stacks, queues, linked lists, graphs, trees, etc., whereas when someone asked an open-ended algorithmic question to be solved on the white board or phone, I struggle under the pressure and gazing eyes of multiple interviewers to solve these problems (whereas I do fine in my own environment with only the pressure of finishing a job).<p>I actually do way better in the interview than when I just have to convince the computer (or myself).  Enough confidence often persuades interviewers to accept handwaving.<p>That advantage is unfair, and makes the interview less predictable of success on the job; but I won&#x27;t complain.

One of my professors came from Kazakhstan, and once casually remarked that a certain problem on a homework set was &quot;impossible unless you were Russian&quot;, since the proof was easy if you knew a certain proposition from Euclid, but extremely tedious without it.<p>EDIT: this interview with Izaac Wirzsup comparing the Soviet and US systems confirms my prejudice:<p><pre><code>  Another extremely harmful feature\n  of [the US] school mathematics programs\n  is that only about half of our students\n  take geometry, and for only one\n  year, generally in a concentrated high\n  school course.

It would basically be a baby, and would have to go through all the developmental stages that we go through.<p>But I suspect we&#x27;ll have a hard time modeling that stuff well enough to create anything more than &quot;adolescent with a severe learning disability&quot;. People underestimate just how carefully tuned we are after millions of years of evolution. The notion that we could replicate that without having another million years of in situ testing and iteration seems naive.<p>And even then, why would we expect the AI to be smarter than a human? There is already quite a lot\nof variation in humans. Many people at the ends of the bell curve have extraordinary processing power in ways typical humans don&#x27;t. But it turns out while those things are useful in some ways, they limit those people in other ways. So it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re not trying out evolved designs, it&#x27;s that on balance they don&#x27;t seem to actually function fundamentally better.<p>One cool thing about the robot is that you could have many bodies having many experiences all feeding into one brain. But I&#x27;m not convinced that would actually lead to &quot;smarter&quot;. I mean, look at old people. Yes we get smarter as we age. But age also calcifies the mind. All of that data slowly locks you into a prison of past expectations. In the end, it&#x27;s a blend of naive and experienced people in a society\nthat maximizes intelligence. And again, it&#x27;s not like societies haven&#x27;t been experimenting with that blend. Cultures have evolved to hit the sweet spot. It&#x27;s not clear that adding 1000 year old intelligences would help.<p>And anyway, we already have 1000 year old intelligences: books!<p>You could say that there is benefit to having all of that in one &quot;head&quot; but then you have to organize it! Which experience drives the decisions, the one from 2014 or the one from 3014?<p>Again, culture evolved explicitly to solve this problem. People write books and the ones that work stick around.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is the evolution of the human being is already here: it&#x27;s the human race, fed history via culture, connected by the internet, in symbiosis with computers.<p>The idea that removing the humans from that system would make it smarter makes no sense to me. Nor does the idea of writing programs to do the jobs that humans do well. It&#x27;s like creating a basketball team with 5 Shaquille O&#x27;Neils. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d actually be able to beat a good, diverse team with one or two Shaqs.<p>Or think of it this way: if numerical/logical aptitude is such a huge advantage in advancing capital-U Understanding, why do smart people bother learning to paint? Why do we bother listening to children? Why do we bother having dogs?<p>I would argue it&#x27;s because intelligence is as multi-media as the universe is. Sometimes a PhD has something to learn from a basset hound. And the human race has just as good a handle on it as any AI ever will. We just have a different view of the stage.

To invent some random figures: for the first $10k (on top of BI) you pay nothing, at $50k you pay $10k, at $100k you pay $30k. For example: for every dollar between $10k and $50k: $0.25, for every dollar beyond $50k: $0.40.<p>Once you earn $50k, your BI cancels out, anything higher and you contribute to the BI of others. (simplifying some more: income tax contributes to BI, all other public expenditures are paid through other taxes, like land or consumption).<p>Progressive taxes are well understood, relatively abuse-free (it can only be gamed by not declaring income), and at no point create a >100% marginal tax rate: tax grows faster than before, but never faster than your income.<p>That way the complexity of welfare, its abuse and people falling through its cracks is eliminated (or so proponents hope), while still &quot;effectively paying&quot; the $10k in BI only to those who really need them.<p>(Disclaimer: the tax brackets above probably break down easily when applied to reality, so only use them to discuss the model ;-) )",1395475245

For higher up positions, it will be always a referral call, but that is a lot of work to do for intern/entry level/medium level engineering to the which you usually lack an unbiased referral source.<p>Also, its delusional to believe a resume is not a selling tool. There are good and bad resumes and its pure salesmanship. Finally, you will have to prove that there is a correlation of any kind between salesmanship and technical ability.<p>A hire is a full package deal. If you interview a total wiz, but he comes to the interview naked, you will not hire him. Well, I doubt I would vote for a hire.",1395475224
7448227,comment,7447510,7448144,6,0,RyanZAG,,,"Agreed - but the whole idea of upvotes is based on the idea that a popular comment = a good comment. The entire foundation of the system falls apart if you dispute that and the upvote system becomes the wrong choice.<p>I think in practice that &#x27;popular comment = good comment&#x27; works well enough that it seems to beat all competing systems for internet commenting so there must be some kind of truth in the statement. Maybe it has a low enough false positive rate to make a small false negative rate acceptable?",1395475220

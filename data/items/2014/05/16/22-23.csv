Think of it like the Linux Foundation, Python Software Foundation, or W3C - its job is to coordinate and advocate for the technology itself, because everybody in the ecosystem benefits from that.  So yes, you can use Bitcoin without caring about the foundation, but future development of the protocol, including most of the interesting stuff surrounding smart contracts and apps.  It&#x27;s somewhat unfortunate that it doesn&#x27;t have the buy-in of many leading players in the Bitcoin ecosystem (and your comment is evidence of that), because that indicates a possible leadership vacuum and fragmentation in the near future.",1400281081

The Stanford students are getting a <i>WAAAAY</i> better education.<p>A lot of students here are weakly prepared, uninterested in academics, and/or have burdensome part time jobs. (I was amazed at how many full-time students here also work 30 hours a week.) This means the expectations are lower, the peer pressure to succeed is not there, and teachers can&#x27;t get very far in their syllabi. We do okay, but we sure as heck don&#x27;t compare to Stanford.<p>For me as an undergrad the choice of schools would have made a major difference.

A monkey is not a less evolved human and a cat is not a less evolved mammal.<p>Many animals have abilities, including intellectual, that we can&#x27;t match (and some we can only crudely replicate with tools). Species have the traits they needed in nature to survive and be efficient.

7758339,comment,7757303,7757684,4,0,tzs,,,"This is reminiscent of the RIPEM situation ~20 years ago. This  was a program that did email encryption using RSA. RSA was implemented using a library from RSA (the company) that was freely distributable but not free software, and because RSA (the encryption method) was patented, there was no way in the US to replace this library with free software.<p>RIPEM also needed a big integer math library. The two main free software libraries for this were the GNU one and the the BSD one, which had different interfaces. RIPEM could be built to use either. This was an option you could set when you ran the build script.<p>The FSF said that distributing the RIPEM source code was a GPL violation, even though they did not claim copyright on any code in the RIPEM distribution. In particular, they were adamant that they were not claiming a copyright on the GNU mp library interface.<p>Their claim was that since RIPEM contained code (the conditional code that used the GNU mp interface) that was only useful with GNU mp, distributing that source code would lead to some people downloading GNU mp, which they would then link with RIPEM and the non-free RSA library, and that this meant that the RIPEM people had effectively distributed GNU mp with non-free software. See note [1].<p>The RIPEM people finally put an end to this nonsense by making a &quot;new&quot; mp library that had the same interface as the GNU mp library and was either (memory is hazy) just a thin wrapper for the BSD mp library, or was just a quick and dirty implementation of the simple, classical mp algorithms that any decent programmer can knock out from Knuth fairly quickly.<p>This meant that people receiving the RIPEM source and choosing to build using the GNU mp interface might not actually build with GNU mp. They might instead build with this new library. Now induced distribution can no longer be inferred. This satisfied FSF.<p>This was pretty astounding. If X is written first, and Y is written second, the answer to the question of whether or not Y infringes the copyright of X does not change if a third thing, Z, comes along AFTER X and Y.

They filtered out reports based on scientific rigour, completeness, overlap, subjectivity etc, and ended up with 22 reports based on 32 unique trials. &quot;TDD effectiveness&quot; was defined as improvement across four dimensions - internal code quality, external system quality, team productivity, and test quality - and each dimension is strictly defined in sufficient detail.<p>They report that high-rigour studies show TDD has no clear effect on internal code quality, external system quality, or team productivity. While some studies report TDD has a positive impact, just as many report it has a negative impact or makes difference at all. The only dimension that seems to be improved is &quot;test quality&quot; - that is, test density and test coverage - and the researches note that the difference was not as great as they had expected.<p>The chapter concludes that despite mixed results, they still recommend trialling TDD for your team as it may solve some problems.

7758268,comment,7757420,7757892,2,0,IgorPartola,,,"Since you insist on a longer explanation, here goes:<p>You can have crypto primitives in the browser: AES, RSA, ECDSA, etc. So given a private key and cyphertext you can decrypt it and given a public key and a piece of cyphertext you can encrypt it. The actual crypto code is just a callout to libssl. In this regard, you can do this right now: simply wrap libssl from within Chrome&#x27;s JS engine and you are done.<p>Now what? What can you actually do with this stuff? Well, you could create an email client: one that downloads a message over XHR and decrypts it. That&#x27;s great, except the code to run this app is unsigned and downloaded from a remote server! I can pwn the server, add my own code that will backdoor the app and send me your private key as soon as it&#x27;s in memory.<p>&quot;BUT!&quot; you say. &quot;I can sign the code!&quot;. I say to that, how will you verify that signature? By downloading the piece of code from a remote server? I&#x27;ll just pwn the server and add my own code to accept my signatures, then add the code to send me your private key.<p>&quot;BUT!&quot; you say. &quot;I can have the signature verification code built into the browser. Look ma, no remote code download that&#x27;s not signed!&quot; I say to that, how do you know that the developer was not forced by the NSA or another powerful adversary to give up their private key or just coerced into created a backdoored package to own you specifically? You don&#x27;t. You didn&#x27;t grab the source and compile it. Instead, you downloaded and ran a code blob.<p>The solution to all of this already exists and it does not involve the web. It&#x27;s called package management. Your distro already does this: multiple people review the source code that goes into every package and every step of the way is cryptographically signed. The binaries are built on trusted machines and distributed with yet more signatures. There is peer review through and through.<p>Compare this to a closed-source web application you are trying to secure. In this case the best you can do is say &quot;if you trust me (the developer), and you trust that I know what I&#x27;m doing so my servers don&#x27;t get pwn&#x27;ed, and you trust that I have not been coerced by the NSA/other gov&#x27;t agency, then you can trust this code&quot;.<p>Except, you don&#x27;t need client-side crypto for that. You already have HTTPS which provides the same guarantee without re-inventing a square wheel. QED.",1400278987

With females (again across species and across societies), intrasexual selection is more often indirect due to female choice.<p>Direct competition is observable and easily addressed. Indirect competition is not by virtue of being indirect. This means that the modern workplace does not afford the conditions for men to compete much if at all except via promotion for doing good work.

Net neutrality is a central reason for that equality, the idea that there is no way for ISPs to become gatekeepers that can auction access, offering a legal means for converting money into a moat that needlessly raises the bar for entering the market. The internet is a powerful societal force, and giving ISPs pernicious influence in how content is propagated seems a dangerous step in conflict with the equality and freedom that has thus far characterized the internet.",1400277639

7758178,comment,7757303,7757925,0,0,saurik,,,"The court opinion stressed pretty strongly that Google&#x27;s usage of the Java API was never actually intended to build an interoperable implementation (stating that Google was unable to point to any specific examples of code that would even be interoperable ;P) but instead to build a non-interoperable platform that was heavily inspired by the work that was put into Java. I think Google could have made a better case for attempting to be interoperable in certain ways (such as with libraries as opposed to &quot;apps&quot;), but apparently they didn&#x27;t, and in fact came off quite strongly as trying to build their own unrelated-to-Java platform for various technical and business reasons. It still seems to be the case that if you are building a system whose goal is truly to be interoperable (such as libedit is to libreadline) you would not run into problems.

I&#x27;m not anti-union, but do tend to be anti-police union.<p>The California Correctional Officers union is routinely accused of pushing for harsher punishments as a job guarantee, which of course is a problem in a state with such over-crowding of its prisons like California.  I would accuse them of gross moral indecency but it takes a pretty indecent person to become a CO anyways.",1390823967

7129886,comment,7128824,7129258,2,0,dsr_,,,"circa 1999, GTE Internetworking (which had been BBN and would be part of Verizon later) moved to a new office building in Burlington, MA. There were several design failures there (the carpet patterns had moire effects, the main corridor was curved so that you could not see what was up ahead) and the biggest failure was the automatic motion-sensing light switches in every office.<p>They were designed to save money, because nobody would forget to turn off the lights. They did an excellent job of keeping people in the dark, partially because of the above sensor problem -- typing on a keyboard doesn&#x27;t provide enough movement to trigger the sensors -- and partially because of their incredibly high failure rate.<p>At about $50 per sensor module installed, they had to keep an electrician on full-time replacing sensors. I heard that eventually they stopped relying on trouble tickets and just swept the building over about a two week cycle.<p>Meanwhile, people bought lights that they could control by themselves. Many of them were halogens running on 150 to 450W.<p>Failed all the way around.",1390823869

The industry has changes radically, but it&#x27;s still very much alive and as vibrant as ever.

Kickstarter is also acting as a fantastic catalyst that&#x27;s matching up audiences with capital to authors and publishers in need of funding. This is enabling a whole host of projects that previously simply wouldn&#x27;t have been viable.<p>There&#x27;s also a mini-renaissance going on in children&#x27;s RPGs with games like Mermaid Adventures, itself a very successful kickstarter project, being a favorite in Chez Hibbs.

And they definitely won&#x27;t get paid nothing for a year while lending money to the company!!!<p>For example you own a local garage. On normal years to make $500,000. Your costs are $400,000. One year thing go bad and you only make $300,000. In most cases the owner will borrow the money to cover the difference. Maybe someone is let go but in most cases the owner tries to retain the staff hoping next year is back to normal. Maybe the owner will use his own money rather than borrow. In any case they will find the money somehow or close.

7129776,comment,7126818,7129709,6,0,exDM69,,,"Thanks for an interesting project! I have also written some bare metal OS projects before and I have a few suggestions for you.<p>First of all, I recommend using a multiboot capable bootloader (GRUB is one, QEMU and Bochs have built in multiboot bootloaders). This will allow you to skip some of the arcade initialization code required. In particular, loading the code from a floppy is painful because most PCs these days don&#x27;t have a floppy drive. So while you&#x27;ll be able to test the code on emulators, running on real hardware require getting a floppy drive. With GRUB, all you need to do is put the binary image in your /boot and you can boot on it with real hardware.<p>When using multiboot, the bootloader will set up 32 bit identity mapped protected for you.<p>Many bootloaders also support setting up a graphics mode, which will save a lot of trouble, because you&#x27;ll have to drop back to 16 bit real mode to access the BIOS interrupts to change the graphics mode.<p>I do understand the appeal of not using a bootloader and doing things from scratch but when it comes to getting things done, that&#x27;s just not a good way to go.<p>I also recommend staying in 32 bit mode, it&#x27;s just a lot easier. In 64 bit mode you&#x27;ll need to deal with paging (no identity mapping is available) and this becomes a burden very early in the project when you will need to access memory-mapped i/o devices (in particular the APIC interrupt controller) and Intel Multiprocessor configuration, which are scattered around the physical memory address space.<p>When you have something that actually works, it is easier to go to 64 bit mode than it is to start from scratch with 64 bit long mode. I found this out the hard way and my hobby OS project[1] stalled because it was just too much work to get anything done in long mode.<p>In addition, I would recommend emitting debuggable elf files instead of flat binary files. Using the QEMU/Bochs monitor will take care of your most basic debugging needs but to go further, remote debugging with GDB is going to be very helpful.<p>Best of luck for your project!<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rikusalminen/danjeros"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rikusalminen/danjeros</a>",1390821589

You should be using prepared statements with PDO or mysqli.<p>I agree, you should be using prepared statements, but using mysql_real_escape_string is not inherently wrong. This is a theme with PHP: if you want to do thing X, you have three different ways, each with different naming conventions, different side effects, different APIs, and at least one of them will subtly lead you to shoot yourself in the foot.<p>Of course an experienced programmer can work around this issues, but I think this is not very relevant to the discussion.<p>>There&#x27;s some XSS issues with the JSON output, the Content-Type header isn&#x27;t set to &#x27;application/json&#x27; so PHP decides to set it to &#x27;text/html&#x27;. Now anyone that controls ipecho.net[0] or can execute commands as any user on the server[1] can XSS users of the panel.<p>This is the kind of thing I expected to happen. It&#x27;s funny how PHP is supposed to be accessible to everyone but can only be used correctly by experts.<p>I know PHP started as a templating engine, and it isn&#x27;t a very good one at that: all of the templating engines I have used escape HTML by default. PHP is the only one that doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know, draw your own conclusions.",1390821200

Apple has long used customized keyboards (i.e. a custom keyboard for URLs) and Microsoft is starting to introduce customized hardware Surface input covers as well. It&#x27;s pretty evident that if you want high-fidelity productivity on a touch screen, you need to adapt your keyboard/input methods to be much more contextual than a general purpose QWERTY keyboard.<p>The real challenge here is designing OS input APIs that don&#x27;t by default segment you into all-or-nothing, &quot;use 100% of our keyboard&quot; or &quot;emulate 100% of the text input.&quot; Emulating 100% of the text input is fine for ASCII, but there&#x27;s a bajillion ways to input other languages and you typically simply can&#x27;t compete with the breadth an OS provides.

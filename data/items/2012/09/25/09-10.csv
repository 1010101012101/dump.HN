The rights already clearly outweigh the obligations, which the author confirms himself by stating that ""given the option I probably would/should have signed it [the contract"".<p>It seems to me the author takes many benefits of having the ""Life as a Service"" subscription for granted, and thus believes they are not part of the service - that they would persist even if there was no overseeing organization. Just to provide an example, the right to own property is only enforced by the service - without it, you only have the 'right' to own whatever you can defend yourself (or convince someone to defend for you).<p>Thus in the 'LaaS' you have to pay taxes, or your property will be confiscated. Without 'LaaS' you have to be ready to fight for whatever you own, or your property will be confiscated.\nSeems like a win for me.",1348567121

In two of the jobs I was at, we ended up making the assertions always-on, even in production, simply because people were too scared to run with them off.  At another job, we simply never used assertions.<p>I've come to the conclusion that if you think you need more assertions, what you really need is more unit tests.  There are other benefits that come from designing for unit tests, like modularity.  Assertions are just a crutch, and they're often a sign that you're not thinking things through clearly (if a is always false when b is true, why do I need two booleans? etc.)",1348566772

In terms of how it works, the easiest way to understand it is probably by thinking freecycle.org, but social.<p>Items are essentially transacted on the basis of 'reasons.' That is, one user gives the other user a reason why he or she should have the item. There is absolutely no restriction as to what a reason might entail - it could involve the telling of a convincing story, the arrangement of a swap, or a person may give his or her item to someone just because they are friends (or know about each other and their interests.) Our assumption is that this is attractive because the scope of what you could get from a transaction is much greater than just money. It also has the whole community vibe going for it, and, in a sense, you're making and growing relationships that may serve you well in the future. In addition, by involving your friends, the experience becomes a svpply.com for repurposing items.<p>It's also localised. Our assumption is that this is attractive because it alleviates the hassle of postage and shipping and also adds to the community feel. ie. people can actually meet in person when items are dropped off/picked up.<p>Your thoughts on what I've written would be invaluable, given objective feedback is the best way to go! I do see value in a concept such as this, especially following the global recession when people are trying to strike a balance between saving money and staying satisfied.<p>I can link you to a version were currently testing if youre interested!<p>Thanks so much in advance,\nJames.",1348565807

Not paper.<p>Though forests used to be cut down for paper. That's no longer the case because it's not profitable anymore. Because of lack of demand.<p>But while the parent poster is right that virtually all paper today comes from sustainably farmed wood. That's still an ecological problem. Because sustainably farmed wood is not native to our eco system. Brazilian flora might take centuries to grow, so farmers would chop down local trees to plant European pine trees instead. Their propaganda, which the parent poster bought into, is that if you chop a tree to plant another, then no harm is done. But that's not how eco systems work. Local fauna cannot live in foreign pine trees, just as they wouldn't live in a concrete city. So many local species are now endangered or extinct because of paper farms.<p>I live on an area where a lot of paper farming used to happen. I had an American friend come here once. He told me the forest around the highway we were on surprised him. Because it looked nothing like the movies he seen, instead it looked just like Europe, with regularly spaced tall pine trees. He asked ""is this where the monkeys are?"", looking closely to the pines hoping to see one. Unfortunately, I told him, during my whole life here I have never seen a monkey in the wild. Even though this same place used to be the home of some really interesting species, like the golden lion monkey. But we could go to the zoo to see one if he wanted to.<p>Source of this is my experience as a local who used to be an active Greenpeace volunteer, back in the day.",1348565653

4569440,comment,4564017,4567023,2,0,lloeki,,,"> Please realize before disagreeing: I develop compilers, and I have developed virtual machines. I know what kind of effort it takes to have parameterized grammars and internal transformations.<p>Please be sure that I totally respect your work. Still, while I agree some of your points are right, I believe you're taking a shortcut here:<p>> For an example of a community that gets this: C. No one develops in K&R C anymore. However, there is still tons of code out there, even code inside of some core projects you use every day, that was written in K&R C and never needed to get serious modifications made.<p>The <i>syntax</i> evolved, but behind this syntax K&R C <i>behaves</i> in the exact same way, all the way up to the latest C revision. You can't say the same for old vs new classes, which behave in a not so subtly different way, and you can't say that either for the new str/old str, and indeed you propose a different name, which is perfectly legitimate, as they are different things.<p>The problem is also a vision of scale. I'd say the designed impact of python 3 breaking changes is not for next year, or even the next two years, but for the next 10-15 years. I think the decision came from the realization that there were retrospectively bad or overlooked design choices, and that they needed to be fixed, and thus cut out, now. The most critical things dropped from python 3 are actually stuff carried over from python 1. Python's design and philosophy is around a form of minimalism. The Zen of Python says:<p><pre><code>    Now is better than never.\n    Although never is often better than *right* now.\n</code></pre>\nI'd say Python3 breaking changes fall in the first case, except the u'', which was a total fail and fell in the second case.<p>I'd say from anecdotal experience that every single python project I write <i>today</i> works on both 2.7 and 3.2. I sure wish python 3.2 received 2.6's <i>from __future__ import unicode_literals</i>, which would, along with 3.3, remove the biggest part of my headaches. The real problem, as stated, lies in the dependencies, and there's no denying that although you can compile K&R C today, such code was not written in a vacuum and certainly (recursively) relies on a bunch of libs that may or may not work today anymore (because of the code itself, the plaform, or the compiler evolving). It is also in plain sight today with Ruby, where a significant number of historical gems simply don't work anymore in 1.9.x (worse, some appear to work, and silently corrupt stuff, up to a point where it blows up. I'm looking at you mysql, which silently fails to transcode strings, the very situation Python introduced an ""upfront error"" breaking change).<p>The point I want to make is that the situation is simply not as clear cut as some want to make it. The short term cost is that we have a rocky transition and that we won't benefit from the new features right now, while the long term benefit will really be seen 10 years down the road. The question you seem to ask is: will Python still be relevant by then? To which none of us has an answer. If not, Python will have paid the price of its 9th zen statement: <i>practicality beats purity</i>.<p>Now I will return to the pending migration of three real world ruby 1.8 + rails 2.1 apps to ruby 1.9 + rails 3.2 (and hell was the migration of some other app from python 2.6 to 3.1 so much easier).",1348565526

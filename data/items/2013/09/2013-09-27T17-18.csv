However, what bothered me about the controller is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to actually be that different.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this markedly improves over current controllers and their integration. The key genres for which the current controllers don&#x27;t work, such as RTS, don&#x27;t seem to be that much better off with this solution. Maybe its just a lack of imagination on my part, but I will have to see more to be convinced.",1380304749

Hell, even recovering typeaholics are starting to believe that Gilad Is Right [1]. Ambrose has managed to get me excited about what types can do for me in dynamic languages without bogging me down.<p>There&#x27;s lots of cool things we can do with types without having them split our language in to two sublanguages (type and term languages), pervading our compilers and runtime environments, and preventing us from doing useful things. If you view types as yet one more tool in your verification toolbox, you gain a lot of freedom. Consider &quot;Type Coverage&quot; as an analogy to &quot;Test Coverage&quot;. I shared that idea with Ambrose, and he jumped right on it! [2]<p>With good, community standardized tooling, we can forgo forcing the type system in to our compilers and down the throats of ever programmer, but still reserve the option when we need more confidence in our code. So get behind types as a library and throw a couple bucks at Ambrose so he can continue his work!<p>[1]: <a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1311"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1311</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/topic/clojure/qiE7PP9uGKg/discussion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/topic/clojure/qiE7PP9uGKg/discus...</a>",1380304564

Sugar water has almost as many calories, but you never feel full.  So you drink 3000 calories of soda a day, and then you&#x27;re fat.<p>Basically, any premade food you find in the store is designed to not satiate you, so you eat (and buy) a lot of it.  The food companies have shareholders that want 10% YOY growth, and the best way to get that growth is to get you to eat 10% more calories.  Since most people buy processed food rather than cook their own, they get 10% fatter every year.<p>(As someone who occasionally eats processed food, I&#x27;ll tell you that it never makes you feel full, and you can definitely pack on the pounds without noticing until it&#x27;s become a real problem.)",1380301636

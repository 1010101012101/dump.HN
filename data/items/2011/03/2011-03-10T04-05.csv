2308119,comment,2307532,2307532,0,0,solipsist,,,"I've heard countless people rave about Salman Khan and his teaching methods - both here and away from HN. The truth is, I had no idea why he and his teachings were such a big deal...<i>until now</i>. I had seen some of his videos before and read some of the articles about the Khan Academy, but had never given them my full attention. To me, it was just another guy with his own teaching methods.<p>But when I see him talk at TED, it makes perfect sense. Not only is he a superb speaker, he gets his points across clearly.<p>Probably the best point of all is this one:<p><pre><code>  ""What I do is I assign the lectures for homework and, what used to be
   homework, I now have the students doing in the classroom.""
</code></pre>
As radical as that may seem, this idea has TONS of potential. Do we really need teachers there in person if they are just lecturing? The real use of being there in person as a teacher is for interacting with the students. What better way to do that than by helping them with the work (i.e. homework) and letting the Khan Academy lecture when little interaction is needed.<p>I am definitely going to hop on the bandwagon now and join everyone else in following Khan while appreciating his pure genius. In fact, the best way to describe him is to combine all the great things people here on HN have to say about him:<p><pre><code>  > He's amazing. (joshu)

  > I really do think Sal Khan will revolutionize teaching. (solarmist)

  > Hero material. (MikeCapone)

  > Future of education. (omfut)

  > Really wonderful reminder of what just one person can set in motion. (runevault)

  > Simply amazing that a guy armed only with a tablet and a microphone can have this
  much impact. (keiferski)

  > He is a big inspiration for anyone looking to change the world. (omfut)
</code></pre>
The list could go on forever. And it's not every day you hear people talking about someone and their ideas in such a way like they are now about Khan and the Khan Academy.<p><i>If people are saying it is amazing, then there's a pretty good chance that it truly is amazing.</i>",1299733086

2308044,story,,,11,10,sharonpaul,"Why is Singapore not yet a superstar in churning out startups?",,"I am perhaps a perfect example of why Singapore is not yet able to churn out many startups as other places such as Silicon Valley and Israel. No doubt these are the rare few superstar nations that are able to do so, but Singapore, with its small size, surely it's citizens are able to rely on each other and create jobs for themselves? Instead, much of our economy relies on foreign MNCs for our ricebowls.<p>As a budding entrepreneur, I then ask myself, why have I not yet started a business?<p>(1) Technology. It all goes back to our history during our founding years. Singapore, while known for its high-tech industries prevalant today, was not always of a high-tech nature. This is very unlike that of Israel, where children are being inculcated into the importance of education since a young age. I once knew of a entrepreneur who started learning coding at age 6. That would never happen in Singapore. It was in our history for kids to help their parents in F&B or trading businsses. Both of which did not require much technological know-how. Even at times of war, it was our government who went after the British to supply us with weapons. Singapore has also been far less experienced in warfare. Contrast this with Israel's need for their own innovation in warfare and aerospace.<p>(2) Marketplace. While we have just about 5 million citizens (talk about a small domestic country), we were fortunate to start off as a well-connected entrepot hub. There was almost little need to create our own technologies back in the 1960s. Trade was the door to all wealth. That explains why youths are drawn to enter the finance industry instead of engineering.<p>(3) Talent pool. Face it, even with the flood of early-stage funding given by the government, there is a lack of mentors who genuinely wish to grow startups. Singapore once had a close-knitted community spirit, similar to that of Israel's Kitbutz system. However, with the government's push for public housing, former village mates lost contact. This led to the downhill in our social fabric. Want help from a community? It is much harder to find like-minded youths with the entrepreneurial (coupled with engineering skills).<p>So..how are things in your city?",1299731278

What I am sure you know is that nothing sells an artist more than hearing their music and deciding for yourself if you like it.  If a good artists gets into rotation enough on radio, they will build a fan base.  We can play a band to a targeted user for $0.01 and that's plenty for what we need to operate.  That's 1/15th the cost of a flier.  We're so committed to treating artists right that, if that user skips you in the first 30 seconds, you're not charged.<p>And in terms of the quality, we also don't sell pipe dreams to bands who will not benefit.

Not only was it the most mentally challenging endeavor I had ever undertaken, it proved to be the most psychologically challenging as well.<p>Fortunately, our two bar prep professors were not only licensed attorneys, but also Ph.D.s in neuropsychology. Part of our rigorous training therefore was not simply learning the law, but actually learning <i>how</i> to learn -- in particular, how to store and recall so much data on demand -- and above all, how to manage our time. (It turns out the human brain is actually quite good at <i>writing</i> and <i>storing</i> data, but really bad at what can be best described as ""random access memory"" operations: recalling random data at will, instantly.)<p>A great deal of emphasis was placed on structuring <i>extremely</i> precise ""living schedules,"" for example, what to study when, for how long, when to eat, what meals, and above all, how and when to sleep. And how to force ourselves to sleep when we couldn't.<p>Long story short, forcing ourselves onto regular sleeping patterns was both immediately necessary and yet proved to be one of the hardest disciplines to learn: to force yourself to stop studying at a given hour (typically 10PM) even in the midst of learning something, and allow time to drive home, have a snack, rest, unwind, and then fall asleep by 11PM, to then awaken at 7 and be back at the library at 8... every single day, for 2 months... that was truly an act of willpower. Especially for me, as I've always been the personality type where, once I start doing or learning something, I can't stop until it's totally finished or mastered. Forcing myself to stop studying without having yet completed the particular matter was excruciatingly difficult.<p>The same thing proved true for the three-day bar exam itself of course: had to sleep between 9 and 10PM and awaken by 6AM, with virtually no studying at all in between days. At this point, you just had to trust your brain to marinate on all that it had absorbed in the 2 months leading up to those fateful three days.<p>Looking back on it now, it was due largely to my discipline with sleeping habits that I was able to pass the bar on my first try.",1299729889

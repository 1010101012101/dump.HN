For example, I don&#x27;t think it currently supports construction or destruction of blocks.<p>Piston, the project that&#x27;s backing Hematite, is very interesting in that it&#x27;s an attempt to explore idiomatic approaches to game engine design in Rust. I&#x27;m not sure how many game developers will value Rust&#x27;s memory safety over C++&#x27;s sheer flexibility and mature tooling, but I commend the Piston developers for taking a chance on a new and unproven language!<p>EDIT: If you&#x27;d like to take a closer look at game development in Rust, be aware that there exist dedicated communities for this on reddit ( <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev</a> ) and IRC ( <a href=""http://client01.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-gamedev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://client01.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&chan...</a> , a.k.a. #rust-gamdev on irc.mozilla.org).",1423511882

I mean, is the average man on the street going have more money to spend if the stuff he needs (food, energy, etc) costs 5% more than it did last year? I&#x27;m not saying deflation is always a good thing, but particularly in times of declining incomes, I find it hard to believe it&#x27;s the scary monster mainstream economists make it out to be.<p>And I particularly don&#x27;t like how Krugman is always so quick to defend large debt loads. He keeps advocating to borrow borrow borrow, with seemingly no restraint. Is that really sustainable?<p>> America has actually been borrowing less from abroad since 2008 than it did before<p>Ya, because we&#x27;re printing the rest.

So part of the outcry was the fact that marketplaces, gateways, and payment processors were not advised or consulted. They found out the same time everyone else did, in the same way everyone else did. One of them was PayPal, who were expected by the EU to be compliant in time for 1/1/15. This was news to them.

Unfortunately, just a high opinion, not a high ability.<p>The OPs code is fine. And was written by a she, not a he.<p>Your suggestion is what is sometimes called &#x27;continuous&#x27; collision detection. It is needed in some cases, particular when the OP approach might miss collisions (less often for when knock-on-collisions are missed, since those are rarer). But that approach is not &#x27;better&#x27; - it is far more time consuming (vastly more for 3d rigid bodies with angular velocity), and has a visual benefit in some cases (not in the OPs case - or at least you wouldn&#x27;t see the difference).<p>But, of course, both approaches are very approximate and only intended to give the right feel. If you wanted to be even more accurate you would process your collisions by subdividing updates around the collision (a good pool-ball simulation does this, to  model proper breaks). And you&#x27;d have to use different integrators than the 1st degree Newton update.<p>This process can keep going as far as you like. For physics systems I&#x27;ve worked on for modelling the behavior of rigid components in MotoGP bikes, the kinds of approximations you allow are very different to the physics engines I&#x27;ve built for commercial games. Neither are &#x27;better&#x27; or &#x27;worse&#x27; - a good programmer understands the requirements of their domain . To that extent, the OP&#x27;s approach is fine, and powers the vast majority of the physics in current generation video games (most engines do support continuous collision detection, but it will be switched off for most rigid bodies in a scene, for performance).",1423511079

You&#x27;ve created a spread here and have locked in a selling price and gave yourself some downside insurance - all for very little cost to you over all since the covered call premium paid for most, if not all of your puts.  Your only risk now is that the stock goes through the roof and you miss out on some upside - but that makes sense as you&#x27;ve eliminated risk for very little out of pocket cost.  So maybe you do this on 1/2 or 2/3 of your position or whatever you&#x27;re comfortable with.<p>Of course the difficulty is if you have a ton of stock and the option market for your company isn&#x27;t very large and therefore illiquid.",1423510596

Rail guns slowly eat themselves so you want a design where (1) the ablation is slow enough that you can still get many shots off before it is non-functional and (2) the ablation is localized in easily, cheaply, quickly replaceable parts.",1423509975

Here&#x27;s their example:<p>&quot;the company needs to ship a product so it’d like to keep their core closed source. The GPL outlaws this kind of interaction. Our good citizen, a company wants to release their patches to your library back to the community and yet the GPL is banning them from doing so!&quot;<p>That last sentence is utterly false, and the exclamation point doesn&#x27;t make it true.  The GPL is absolutely not prohibiting them from distributing their patched version of anyone&#x27;s library.  It merely requires that if they do so then they might have to publish other source as well.  <i>MIGHT</i>.  I&#x27;ll get to that in a moment.  The point is that GPL is adding a requirement, not a prohibition.  Might they find that requirement onerous?  Certainly.  Nothing wrong with that, but portraying it as a prohibition is dishonest.<p>Now, about that &quot;might&quot; part.  GPL might require that you publish other code <i>only if</i> it meets operative definitions of linkage and derivative works.  Those are complex issues which I doubt can be addressed adequately here on HN, but maybe we can set some bounds.  At one extreme, if you use a public API to an existing library which is loaded separately from your proprietary code, you&#x27;re almost certainly OK.  At the other extreme, if your proprietary code meddles in the GPL code&#x27;s internals or vice versa (via your patches) to the extent that either becomes meaningless without the other, then you&#x27;d probably be held to have created a derivative work and would be required to publish the interdependent code under GPL.<p>The way this works out in practice is that the majority of proprietary/GPL combinations actually do not create an obligation to publish anything except your patches to the GPL code involved.  When that&#x27;s not the case, it&#x27;s by design to prevent the &quot;secret sauce&quot; version of a library from displacing its still-open antecedent.  Agree, disagree, but please don&#x27;t misrepresent.",1423509335

Not sure I will ever understand the idealogical debate of different OSS software licenses.<p>Ultimately, different licenses work well for different projects. More permissive OSS licenses (BSD/MIT and other) seem to be the best choice for libraries and other bits of code that can be freely shared and used without worrying about modification restrictions, linking, etc etc.<p>GPL on the other hand has really found its niche in larger projects for complete software packages that often are primarily developed by a single entity but made open to allow contributions and customizations.<p>Both types fit a use case, both types are useful and we have seen success using both models.

9022955,comment,9020165,9020561,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"This is true, but in many cases people are trying to avoid tax by placing money in a secret account. It&#x27;s not like regular banks in the UK throw information out to the newspapers as a matter of course, but they would respond to requests from the tax authorities or from a court in the case of a commercial or divorce dispute. Many people with Swiss bank accounts have them not so much because they wish to live in Switzerland but because of the secrecy, ie they wish to conceal things from people who would otherwise legitimately have access.<p>Now this is not true in all cases, of course. People who lead international lifestyles often find a Swiss account useful because everyone has heard of Swiss banks, and their association with international transfers long predates the SWIFT system. So it makes sense people King Abdullah of Jordan (who has zero tax liability as a monarch, but who is heavily engaged in diplomacy and power-brokerage), or the late Helmut Newton, a famous fashion photographer (who never had very much in his Swiss bank account - a few tens of thousands - but who worked all over the world).<p>So I don&#x27;t think that having a Swiss bank account is dispositive of anything by itself, but at the same time it would be disingenuous to ignore the fact that they have often been used to obscure taxable income.",1423508641

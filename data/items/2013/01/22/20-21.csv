If not then go to the one that you think will benefit you most in the long run, and there are a lot of factors that could play into that decision which i dont think anyone on here could tell you the answer to.<p>What kind of work do you want to finally end up doing? \nHow much responsibility will you be given at each? \nWill you make better connections at one or the other?\nWhich work environment do you like more?\nAre you passionate on interested in the work they are doing?\nWhich one will provide you with a better learning experience?<p>There are so many personal factors that weigh into a decision like this, and money may or may not be a large factor for you. But thats up to you to decide. Ultimately i think it comes down to where you'll be happier, and which will help you the most down the road. Answer those to questions and i think you will probably come to your answer.",1358888331
5099539,comment,5098418,5099308,2,0,akeefer,,,"Fundamentally, what matters is the set of invariants you want to preserve, and it's usually the case that some number can be preserved for you by the database and some can't and have to be dealt with at the application level.  So by ""consistency"" I mean ""some invariants that I care about will be preserved,"" but that doesn't mean all such invariants are.<p>For example, if I'm writing a process that merely queries a table to pull back the user's account balance in a single query, read committed isolation might be enough for that particular use case to have ""consistency:""  I know I'm always seeing some consistent balance, even if it might not reflect transactions that are currently in flight (thus giving me a different answer if I run the query it again in 2 seconds).  That's still a better consistency guarantee than if I have a read dirty isolation level (or effectively no isolation), so it's still useful.<p>If I'm doing an actual update to account balances, however, that level of consistency is no longer good enough, obviously:  if all updates hit the same rows in the same tables then snapshot isolation level might be good enough to avoid problems.  And if that's not good enough, then I can acquire explicit update locks and such, if the conflict has a risk of update locks across different tables.  Even in that case, though, I'll need to worry about application-level invariants (like ""a person can only withdraw up to $300 per day."").<p>So my point is that even without serializable isolation the database can still guarantee some invariants for me, even if it can't guarantee all of them, and that the database can never really guarantee preservation of all of the invariants that matter to me no matter how strong it's guarantees, so I always have to think about what I'm going to handle at the application level anyway.<p>In the case of my company (which makes applications for insurance companies), we do have to think about those sorts of things, but again, we have to think of a ton of things anyway, and the division of labor between the app tier and the database tier is always something we have to worry about.  We do things like build optimistic concurrency into our ORM layer to make most common cases easier to think about, and we have pretty well-defined transaction lifecycles, but for the most complicated cases we have to think about what the potential for race conditions in the database would be, just like we have to think about them at the application level, and then we have to decide how to handle them.  Again, even a ""true"" ACID database wouldn't prevent us from having to do that work, because many of the invariants we want to preserve in the data aren't expressable in the database anyway.",1358888324

In truth we actually provide something closer to snapshot-isolation by default. Snapshot isolation in summary is a guarantee that all reads made in a transaction will see a consistent state of the database. A transaction will only fail to commit if there is a conflict of two updates. This is a strong isolation level that does have a set of anomalies but most companies don't care about them.

The amount of fake trials and hidden experiment data that pharmas participate in is absurd.

The drug hit the market and was later pulled off the shelves because, you guessed it, people started dying! While I don't believe the reporting of all trials will fix that level of deceit, it's certainly a great step in the right direction. Pushing for public reporting of data concerning meds that people might eventually <i>put into their bodies</i> only makes sense.<p>Next up: Abolishing sponsored research clinical trials, or at least increasing the transparency of research sponsorship instead of burying the fact that the research PI is actually an employee of Pfizer somewhere deep in the appendices.<p>It's amazing how we have organizations like Consumer Reports to give us objective reviews of toasters and cars, yet nothing like that exists for medications or medical devices, isn't it?<p>Edit: So I'm confusing 2 things:<p>1) Fen-phen was a diet pill pushed to market despite evidence that it caused valvular heart damage.

Thus, they should, if anything, earn less, not more.<p>On the second topic, many managers seem to come from the view ""I am boss. You do as I say."" Rather than the view of ""My job is to make your life easier. How can I help?"" The former view will naturally create a lot of friction.<p>The other problem with control comes back, once again, to background. Managers that were previously engineers generally get a pass. But it seems that in some cases you have managers making technical decisions without the required technical background. Unsurprisingly, the people who <i>do</i> have the technical background, and get paid less on top, will have an issue with this.<p>I suspect that these are the true problems in the room, but ones that nobody wants to address.",1358886906

There's a great blog post[1] about this using Reactive Banana and Haskell.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://apfelmus.nfshost.com/blog/2012/09/03-frp-dynamic-event-switching-0-7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apfelmus.nfshost.com/blog/2012/09/03-frp-dynamic-even...</a><p>Most of the post is fairly Haskell-specific, talking about the type system, but the basic idea should be applicable here as well.<p>The running example is a bar tab. You want to be able to create new entries in the tab, which are just text entries that give you a price. So you would create something like<p><pre><code>    entries :: Event [Behavior Price]\n</code></pre>\nThat is, you have a stream of events that contains behaviors corresponding to each text entry widget you've added. This makes calculating things like the sum of all the widgets relatively easy.<p>I'm not sure how other libraries support this dynamic event switching though.

Basically they just ask the doctor to fill out a one page survey at the end asking how they felt about how the medication worked, but it's garbage data that couldn't even be used for anything. Basically most phase IV trials, with the exception of the small number the government mandates as a condition for drug approval, are just a scam so that pharma companies can bribe doctors and also so they can list their marketing expenses as R&D in their SEC statements.<p>Also, the vast majority of trials are never published as journal articles even if they're registered. This is because there is no government mandate to actually report the results of any clinical trial, even the registered one. Which is why when determining the safety and efficacy of a drug you should never look at the published studies, because that will always give a wildly inaccurate view in a way that's extremely biased in favor of the drug companies.

5099312,comment,5096009,5098228,5,0,graue,,,"Sure. There are many technical flaws, but to me, the worst part is how Tent is very opinionated about removing content. The developers deliberately made it difficult. In version 0.2, their changelog[1] casually mentioned a new feature:<p>> <i>Profile Versioning - Profiles are versioned like posts. Previous versions can be fetched directly or if no version is specified the most recent version is returned.</i><p>What this means is if you have a real name or email on your profile, but then edit it out because you are getting stalked, surprise! The info is still there. Anyone who can see your <i>current</i> profile can also see <i>every old version</i> with everything you removed. Tent.io exposed their users by making it impossible to purge revealing info from your profile, unlike every other social networking service I can think of. When I raised concerns, the developers insisted that their users would be to blame for any consequences and basically said if you don't want something available in perpetuity, you shouldn't have put it online in the first place.<p>Imagine the howls if Facebook gave everyone access to the full versioned history of your profile with no way to turn it off. When we write social software, <i>we</i> are the professionals and we have a responsibility to give users sensible defaults and understandable tools to manage what they disclose. Violating expectations, then blaming the users for not understanding the protocol as well as we do, is unacceptable to me.<p>But the Tent developers don't see it that way. They're heavily inspired by an old vaporware project called Project Xanadu, which dates to the 1960s, when computers were owned by institutions, not people. Xanadu's rules of operation[2] notably make no allowance for private content. The utopian vision for Tent seems to involve this half-century-old concept, which has no relevance to the real problems people face in their social lives today, basically replacing much of the web. With OAuth2 authentication and notions of private posts haphazardly tacked on. It just doesn't seem realistic. It seems like the Tent.io folks are more interested in hewing to this ideal concept in their minds rather than looking around and solving problems people actually have.<p>Tent is a cool toy though. Some of the issues you might face playing with it:<p>There's a lack of robustness. Servers get out of sync (B believes it is following A, but A doesn't list B as a follower), and it's hard to get them back in sync. Message delivery is supposed to be retried if your server is down, but it doesn't seem to work. Discovery is slow, so app developers cache heavily, which defeats the point of discovery in the first place (moving the underlying Tent server, which should be seamless, causes problems). Authentication patterns are complex and ad-hoc depending on the relationship (or lack thereof) between two servers, something the developers plan to fix when they ""add crypto"" to a later version of the protocol. The server code is messy and sparsely commented. The spec is vague and omits error conditions.<p>I'm not sure what the next step is for me. I'd like to learn from what Tent does right (fully decentralized, app-agnostic, protocol first) as well as its mistakes. One idea I'm tossing around is building an Instagram-like social network with a Dropbox backend, as a proof of concept  see how far I can get with an unbundled storage service that's already mature.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://tent.io/blog/tent-v02"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tent.io/blog/tent-v02</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu#Original_17_rules"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu#Original_17_rul...</a>",1358885753

And what I see is that a lot of people who insist on the absolute need for ACID don't really understand it because they're using non-ACID technology right now.<p><i>I do not understand what point you are trying to make here.</i><p>Consider MySQL with asynchronous replication to a slave. In a weak sense, that is a distributed system because the remote slave is on a different machine (and probably very distant) from the master. But the distributed bit here doesn't interfere with correctly implementing ACID: MySQL with async replication operates identically to single node MySQL: it just transmits the binary logs to a slave server. The database system itself is a single-node service whose state gets replicated at transaction boundaries.<p>In contrast, distributed shared-nothing databases like Volt have to work really hard to maintain consistency: there is no single node in those systems that does all the work and gets replicated: multiple nodes have to cooperate in order to get anything done.",1358885085

5099236,comment,5098418,5098418,10,0,akeefer,,,"While I appreciate how thorough the article is, it's a bit of a strawman.  Pretty much everyone who makes use of a relational database in a professional capacity has to be aware of what transaction isolation level they're using, make their own choice about what to use, and then do things like acquire explicit update locks or do optimistic locking in order to ensure data integrity.  But that doesn't mean that the ACID properties are useless merely because you have to do that; it might mean you have to think about a few things more than you'd like to, but it's still a different world than trying to mimic ACID properties in a NoSQL database, and there are still fairly hard guarantees about things like consistency that you get with other isolation levels.  For example, with read committed or snapshot isolation, I still have transactionality and can be sure that if I issue a sequence of 10 updates in a single transaction and then commit it, any other single query is either seeing the results of all 10 or of none of them.  That's an important guarantee in many situations, and it's a guarantee that I can use to make decisions about how I structure my application logic.<p>The author of the post basically seems to treat any isolation level below serializability as some sort of sham perpetrated on the development community, and that's not the case:  they're still useful, and they're still something that you can use to build the sorts of application guarantees you want.  The mere fact that pretty much every database vendor gives you a choice as to what isolation level to use should be a pretty obvious clue that there's no one-size-fits-all answer there, so harping on the non-existence of a serializable isolation level is somewhat missing the point.",1358884916

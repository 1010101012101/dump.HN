We all beg steal and borrow from each other anyways - So why not just spare us the grind of doing the same mistakes over and over again and build a data sharing industry connecting all the valleys around the world!<p>A bit of background information on this project:<p>I previously worked as a product developer/designer within one of Scandinavia&#x27;s largest Media companies separately owning over 40 of Scandinavia&#x27;s most popular websites and apps. During the process of redesigning one of the platforms, we had an argument about how our conversion funnels were to be laid out.<p>But instead of having a pity argument, we came up with the idea of asking the other 40 companies for their data related to their conversion funnels (since everyone was operating within the same (almost) product segment but under different management and co-ownership) And everyone agreed and thought it was a great idea and we got top-level management on our side with doing this since all the 40 companies were encourage to cooperate with each other anyways!<p>Much said and done, it became an analytic and bureaucratic nightmare, trying to gather and compile data from 40 different sources, all spread out across Europe, everyone measuring the different sets of metrics, in different analytic tools, so we eventually abandoned the idea.<p>But I just could not let go of the idea of data-sharing, especially for Startups - And as a longtime fan of  Formula One, and know how important &quot;instructive product development&quot; has been for Formula One Teams.<p>I have shared a few thoughts on data sharing here on HN, so if you want to read more, just have a look at my previous posts.<p>Cheers!",1417175980

8670588,comment,8669625,8670295,0,0,ghshephard,,,"I like the general balanced approach you are taking, but I have to critique a few elements.<p>Service dependability - I take cabs exclusively, and, while I can&#x27;t comment on other markets, I have deep knowledge of the bay area taxis.   First, it&#x27;s important to note, that even when they are operating in &quot;normal mode&quot; - you can never, ever quickly get a taxi on the peninsula.   Minimum time is always about 15-20 minutes, and frequently 30 minutes.  Also, when it&#x27;s busy, or late - forget it, you will not get a taxi.  Compare this to Uber, that works hard to ensure you will always have a ride, regardless of time, level of busy.  And yes, basic economics therefore suggests that in order to make that happen, you will have to vary the price.  But, I would definitely like to have the <i>choice</i> of taking a more expensive ride, then no ride at all.<p>Non-Discrimination: You&#x27;ve got it backwards.  Taxis discriminate all the time based on every conceivable factor.  Uber doesn&#x27;t even let the driver know where you are going, and the driver is committed to picking you up before he sees if you are young or old, black or white, male or female.  About all they can discriminate on is <i>how well you treat them</i> (Drivers rate passengers).<p>Your Driver tracking thing is a long stretch.  A better example would be, &quot;Taxi Drivers in general have been doing their job for a while, there is little churn, so it&#x27;s unlikely you will get one that will rob or rape you, (though it&#x27;s not unheard of, particularly with drunk passengers.)  as those drivers who do that are probably going to get fired, and it&#x27;s less common to get new drivers with taxi services than with uber.<p>Of the 200 or so RideShares, the worst one I got was a Driver who had only been working for Lyft for a week, and used her cellphone to get GPS directions to the airport, and came to a hard stop at a stop sign.   Every other one has been excellent, courteous, and clean safe cars.  I have no end of horror stories of psychotic taxi drivers driving cars that sometimes wouldn&#x27;t open from the inside.",1417174813

That ship has already sailed, Pam. There are two webs now: the document-centric, platform-agnostic, user-controlled presentation of content as envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, and the over-specified development platform that is HTML5, that ultimately originated in Win98&#x27;s Active Desktop &quot;push technology&quot;.<p>The latter has gained world-wide adoption because developers and industries couldn&#x27;t agree to build a standard software repository that was distributed and allowed independent re-implementations of the running engine.

App stores later are becoming a close second, but being walled gardens they&#x27;ll never replace that role in full.<p>It&#x27;s still useful to think of &quot;the two webs&quot; as different purposes for the HTML5 technology; it&#x27;s a good question in particular to ask yourself before you start a new website and decide what of the two models you want to support.

Maintainting the theory of the system is one of the most important things but I&#x27;m really sceptical an IDE and a tool based process can do it for us.<p>Yes, there should be preferably only one place and way to do a particular thing but that does not mean they have to be all bound to the same tool.<p>I.e. the algorithm development you described in your example used completely unnecessary gaps in the communication. If the expert and you had reserved time with a whiteboard or a google hang out and ironed out the bugs right there without this nonsense going through the formal code review process it would have been much easier for all parties.<p>If your boss wants to participate in the process and does not trust you enough that so he needs to doublecheck on every trivial detail I would call that micromanagement. Or, he can join in the discussion when it is going on if he can have valid input into it. Otherwise he should trust you to do the right thing, and if he wants to check up on things the revision history in the spec document  (or just v1 and v2 of the spec) should be sufficient combined with the code changes.<p>If the boss wants to doublecheck on everything or the process requires that all communication related to code changes (including that quick discussion you had with the chief architect at the urinals) is stored then the problem is in the process that is too heavy with non-value-adding baggage and no tool can fix it.<p>Storage of the spec should be formalized, code review should be formalized, but not all communications and work related to data that is input into these system should and can be formalized.<p>I think the idea that tools will fix the process is a faulty idea - the process needs constant vigilance from human participants and tools can only facilitate it. Expert work can be incredibly value adding but it needs to be first and foremost built on trust between individuals and clear ownership of responsibilities. Final products can and need to be bound to formal constraints - the process needs rigor on an individual level but not anal-retentive overseeing over every minutiae.",1417173128

I care deeply about the ongoing Giro d'Italia, and if all goes well, will go watch a stage in the near future, but I wouldn't post daily results on this site.  Nor would I attempt to inflict my own political and economic views on the other users.  Were we all to do that, the site would rapidly degrade.",1211129793

It's just a series of quotes from crazy people who tell us we're all going to die without providing much justification other than ""climate change, man!""<p>Oh, okay, there's a fair point about overfishing.<p>""All of these authors agree that the entire system of Western food production is in need of radical change, right down to the spinach. Roberts opens with a description of E.-coli-infected spinach from California, which killed three people in 2006 and sickened two hundred others.""<p>Another of my pet peeves is when people criticize the ""Western"" system of doing something without providing any contrast with an ""Eastern"" way of doing it. Is the Eastern system of food production better? Are there fewer cases of food poisoning from contaminated food in Asia? I don't think so.",1211129740

Teaching children to use a proprietary (non-free) system such as Windows does not make the world a better place, because it puts them under the power of the system's developer -- perhaps permanently. You might as well introduce the children to an addictive drug.<p><a href=""http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/can-we-rescue-olpc-from-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/can-we-rescue-olpc-from-windows</a>",1211129716

I actually find, as you do, that industry is refreshingly direct compared to pure research, which is why I prefer it.<p>I used to work at Agilent, a.k.a. ""the good parts of the former Hewlett-Packard."" And, with the usual handful of exceptions, it really was the largest collection of nice folks that you'll ever meet. So, yeah, I believe in the existence of good businesses.<p>What I refer to is the emotional learning curve coming out of school. The part where you learn, among other things, that not <i>everybody</i> is trustworthy, and that not every market-leading product is worth what it costs. That the ugly method that is currently shipping is often better than the elegant but theoretical alternative. That some of your company's products are, inevitably, better than others. That any group of more than five people will face political problems, misunderstandings, and red tape. And that without those folks doing the marketing and accounting your business won't function.<p>None of which actually means that industry is a big con. It's just <i>real</i>. It's not made of imaginary people living in an imaginary land. Academia is the same, actually, though when you're in an especially bitter mood -- or faced with the occasional person who <i>really is a con artist</i> -- you might think otherwise.",1211129519

But as time and projects have gone by, I'm starting to switch viewpoints.<p>Basically, 90% of the people I talk to couldn't implement my idea or simply don't care.  Those that could implement it won't, b/c they think they have better ideas.  Of the few who could and might, it's your job to convince them that their best chance of making it work is by joining you.<p>On top of that, I've found that talking about what you're going to do is a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>That said, I would never go around telling the juiciest parts of my ideas to people I didn't already trust, or post them online where anyone and their mom can steal them without much remorse.",1211128863
193440,story,,,6,7,Tichy,"Ask HN: Erlang and network connections?",,"I was interested in the latest use of Erlang for Comet by Facebook. However, thinking further about it, I wonder how the HTTP connections are typically being implemented (on Linux, say)? Erlang solves the problem of having lots of threads listening, but I am guessing it does not solve the problem of having lots of connections? Is there one thread listening to a network adapter, distributing the packages to the ""virtual"" connections? Or does the OS spawn a thread for every Connection it creates (presumably in some arcane C implementation)?<p>Maybe for the comet problem it would make more sense to optimize at that point, ie only spawn threads on incoming data? Erlang might still come in handy, depending on the number of concurrent messages, but perhaps not be the killer app it looks to be?",1211128831

OLPC is for poor nations or say for 3rd world countries and i dont think NGOs/Govt./schools have any preference over what o/s it comes with as far as it can launch all educational application. OLPC laptop is not meant for scientists anyway,  so what the fuss - just keep it simple and open source and create nice educational material so that kids form these countries can learn something valuable. Also 3rd world countries are very humble and they will be more than happy just to get this laptop (with or without XP).",1211128268

Just having daily goals isn't enough - it's too easy to procrastinate and then work long hours to make up for it.<p>I also try to schedule a two hour chunk each day (preferably near the beginning) with minimal interruptions and just leave emacs and shells open. Regardless of how many meetings  or other distractions come up the rest of the day, I can guarantee some amount of forward progress on the technical front. It's actually pretty amazing how much can get done in two hours if you're very focused.",1211127575

193425,comment,193284,193391,0,0,mtts,,,"Actually, regulation and subsidies can be <i>good</i> for food production. They give farmers a fighting chance against big food corporations, which helps the food supply because while a small farm may not be profitable without government subsidies, it <i>is</i> better at producing more calories per square meter of land under cultivation.<p>Take, for example, green house tomatoes. They grow to enormous sizes exceedingly quickly so they're profitable, but, as anyone who's ever grown a single tomato plant on a balcony can testify, they have absolutely zero taste and rather limited nutritional value compared to the real thing. Likewise, as was touched upon in the article, high quality poultry is far more nourishing than industrially produced chicken breasts that consist mostly of water.<p>Government subsidies allow farmers to continue producing high quality produce locally, even if it is in a manner that is, from a free market point of view, inefficient.",1211127411

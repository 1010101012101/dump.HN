And that's definitely one area where the free services (yeah, GMail) are lightyears ahead of any paid service.  So apart from 'infrastructure' stuff (like hosting, domain names, etc.) my online existence is completely free.  And I honestly don't see that changing, ever.",1242302248

As all the commercial software turns to online service, you have to pay monthly fee in order to use the service. Linux will dominate the network market as it was done in embedded system market because it can easily be customized. Any software value on the customized distro (browser, email or IM) is included in the hardware sales (like decades ago when we sold these ""huge"" computers).",1242301902

608545,comment,608202,608404,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Yes, it matters. Most smaller companies tend to be service companies, because they don't have huge economies of scale. Most product companies tend to be larger -- it's easy to moonlight as a designer who figures out what box you should sell a lightbulb in, but you can't moonlight as the guy building the lightbulbs, because you need tens of millions of dollars to manufacture them profitably.<p>A subsidy to small businesses that didn't exclude service businesses would have the effect of making more people want to work for service companies. Which is fine, except that they produce negligible exports. If you're selling lightbulbs, you make money in India by selling them there; if you're a lawyer, the way you make money in India is by hiring an Indian lawyer in India, and somehow convincing this lawyer to give you a fraction of his billings (so most of the money stays behind).<p>Given the potential trade deficit problems, I suspect Obama wants to focus on subsidizing businesses that can export.",1242300714

608536,comment,608345,608345,0,0,sho,,,"An interesting, if somewhat pessimistic, speech. One quibble: he states the size of ""an atom"" as being around 1nm. I thought it was more like 0.4nm, if he's talking about silicon anyway. Not a game-changing difference, but still.<p>And he also seems to dismiss rather perfunctorily the promise of upcoming technology and techniques - the most egregious example being the scorn he pours on the potential of 3D computers, which he seems to think is merely stacking a few photolithographed dies on top of each other. I think this is somewhat misguided; most of what I've read on the subject talks about building, via nanotechnological (or even biological) assembly, true three-dimensional structures, with the massive increase in connectivity this allows. I'm by no means an expert on the topic but if you want a hint of evidence that this technique might be useful, I'd ask you to consider that treasure trove of as-yet unattainable computing technology: the human brain.<p>Good talk though, thought-provoking, although what it really provokes me to do is argue with the author ...<p>(edit: oops, I was thinking of the <i>radius</i> of Si.

First of all - what that means?:
[level of living standards in United States is still a lot higher.]
I never heard about this expression - ""level of living standards"".Where it is derived from?<p>Now if we abandon PPP adjusted GDP we'll see that US is not that super-rich country - average GDP per capita places USA on 17th place, far behind many european countries.

Even Canada (that has been long time a laughstock of USA),
in fact has a tiny little difference in nominal GDP with USA - 1-2k$. 
So why nominal GDP of Canada is 2000$ less than American, but adjusted 8000$ less?.
Because Canada is a lot more equal society:
GINI (inequality) in Canada = 34 (little higher than european)
GINI in USA = 45 (average for African countries).
To maintain equality you need more taxes. So less left in pockets of consumers.<p>Now, let's move to hallucinations: ""European unemployment rate is higher than American"":
USA=10%
Norway=3.6%
Netherlands = 3.6%
Denmark=4.40%
Austria=4.8%<p>You want me continue??

For one, I like Brightkite because it's an okay place to start conversations. If I really want something to go to Twitter and Facebook, and to easily geo-tag my mobile photo uploads on Flickr, Brightkite is hard to beat. That said, I don't check in everywhere I go, and my check-ins are often vague. Cities or major intersections instead of actual addresses or venues. Of course, there are exceptions.<p>Generally, I only check in when I want people to know where I am, and it's often an invitation to come kick it with me. And if I check in to the same coffee shop every Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning, you'd bet I'd be glad to have you come up and and have a talk over a cup of joe if you ""stalk"" me and can predict where I'll be. Heck, I've met two people I consider great friends simply because we were checked in nearby on Brightkite and finally crossed paths.<p>It comes down to moderation.

Frankly, outsourcing is going to stay. What is going to change is the way things are done. These companies have already figured out ways to get things done from not-so-good people by making use of the right tools and process. This will mostly likely be expanded further where development of the most common things would be mechanical without any kind of creativity involved. And yeah, people on the other side would move on to building tools that enable it :)",1264145658

Oftentimes banks will set a hard limit on the number of unsuccessful attempts you can make before they lock you out entirely. Then you have to phone them and jump through a number of hoops to prove you are who you say you are, and then reset the password. If they do a really good job preventing brute-forcing, then having an un-brute-forceable password is not necessary any more.<p>The easiest example of this is debit card PINs. They are usually only 4 numeric digits, and yet are trusted by banks for direct access to accounts. This is because a) banks have sophisticated systems to track brute-forcing and other kinds of abuse, b) longer pins are more prone to being written down, forgotten, and mistyped, and c) there are limits on how much you can purchase / take out per day, limiting the potential damage.",1264145617

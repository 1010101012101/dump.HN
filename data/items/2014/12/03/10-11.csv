8692994,comment,8692537,8692537,0,0,kator,,,"> A new customer signed up for our service and brought in multiple domains that were already facing a DDoS attack. The customer had already tried at least 2 other providers before DNSimple. Once the domains were delegated to us, we began receiving the traffic from the DDoS.<p>I&#x27;m curious did they know this in advance or discovered it after the fact?<p>I often wonder about business models where the core expense is &quot;unlimited and free&quot;.  The reality is there is nothing unlimited or free for the service provider.  It seems with a business model like this you open yourself to people abusing your service either by accident or by choice.  Imagine poor Mr. Customer here who most likely was having horrible problems thinking to themselves &quot;These guys can do it and for free, if I go to X service they&#x27;ll cost me a lot of money&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m a big believer in business models that incentivize both parties properly.  I&#x27;m sure in general this service provider is arbitraging the 99.9% of domains that barely need any services.  That said it only takes a couple of &quot;opps&quot; customers to drive your operational costs through the roof.",1417604187

Will Wire be any different?<p>One argument is that is doesn&#x27;t matter. Messaging is such an attractive market that people just continue to invest in it. Telecos certainly didn&#x27;t have any problems making money back in their hay-day, and there is the &quot;get all the eyeballs and monetize later&quot; argument that is still popular. Perhaps as consumers we&#x27;re just doomed to switch platforms every 5-10 yrs as companies rise and then fizzle out. Perhaps churn is the price we pay for free messaging?<p>FWIW I did pay for Skype for a short while, as I needed some features, but then their billing structure changed and other free products became popular so I stopped.",1417604133

I.e. you need to write a different type system for each property (of course, they can all work together). Maybe that&#x27;s the only known way to do that. Searching for more general solutions, I&#x27;ve come up empty handed (the problem is well known, but the solutions are all in early stages of research).<p>The idea of such a type system needs to be something like: each function has a set of types associated with it, and a function&#x27;s type interacts with the types of the functions it calls in some ways. So the most primitive example is, of course, checked exceptions, where the type of a function is a simple union of the types of its callees.

8692969,comment,8692742,8692742,0,0,dalke,,,"> I find this scenario inevitable and have recently dedicated myself to investing in commons that aren’t owned by any particular company.<p>Mozilla is a company. It&#x27;s a non-profit company, but still a company. So is the Python Software Foundation, the Free Software Foundation, and other copyright/trademark holders to community developed projects.<p>I think this means the author will not be supporting those companies.<p>> However, if a company owns the project in any way (trademark, website, project governance) there is an incentive for them to extract value from the project rather than create it.<p>Isn&#x27;t this also true for people? Consider Firefox. If the community (I&#x27;ll say 90% of the developer and user base) decides that it needs a trademark, in order to have a legal means to go after people who sell &quot;Firefox&quot; browsers with built-in spyware, then someone needs to control that trademark.<p>If it&#x27;s a single person, then certainly there can also be an incentive for that person to extract value from the project.<p>I think the analogy to a corporate owned/publicly maintained park applies even here. Exactly the same thing could happen if the park were owned by a person instead of a company.<p>In practice though, we have some experience with that sort of situation. These sorts of parks are set up as &quot;privately owned public spaces&quot;. For example, Zuccotti Park in NYC, heart of the Occupy Wall Street movement, is a POPS, which meant that the owners of the land didn&#x27;t have the right to do certain actions.<p>There are other, old examples too, like easements. If part of privately held land has been used for, say, a road or beach access, then the owner of the land cannot simply close it off. Perhaps that might be a way to consider the topic, rather than simply ownership or control of a monopoly right.",1417603714

I&#x27;m very annoyed by current political and economical situation. I was so upset by events happening last months that I simply stopped reading russian news at all. And I spent all the time in places like GitHub, Topcoder, English Wikipedia, Hacker News etc. Yesterday, I&#x27;ve tried to make yet another commit to my private repository and suddenly I failed to connect to GitHub.

I can tell you that even top managers from leading russian internet company (from my private conversation with them) dreamed about great russian firewall because in that case, they won&#x27;t have competitors like Google. Furthermore even IT guys like Putin regime and don&#x27;t get worry about crazy laws passed against the internet. I assure you in that because many of my colleagues really like Stalin and really like what&#x27;s happening in Ukraine. Almost all people in Russia really hate western world. They don&#x27;t care about currency exchange rates and inflation, they care only about imperialism.

The bigger an organization, the more dis-aligned individual and collective incentives become.<p>* In a start-up you can&#x27;t afford to harm the enterprise in order to further your own interest: if you act parasitically you&#x27;ll kill your host almost immediately.<p>* In a big company, you won&#x27;t make a meaningful difference, neither positively nor negatively, so you may as well serve your own interests, irrespective of their effect on the whole company.<p>Corollary: people who want to play corporate politics concentrate in big companies, because that&#x27;s where you can do it with relative impunity.<p>Big private companies offset this competitive disadvantage through economy of scales and/or lobbying; public services do it through taxes and monopolies. NASA isn&#x27;t inefficient because it&#x27;s public, but because it&#x27;s huge. Its only chance to beat SpaceX would have been through political influence, the way taxis lobby against Uber (or car dealers against Tesla, AT&T against antitrust laws...), but it&#x27;s too late, SpaceX is already too visibly successful and too useful: any politician killing it would be classified as corrupt / communist / whatever you call a shameless apparatchik in the USA.",1417603320

It often happens to be good enough for most practical purposes, yes, but arbitrary-precision arithmetic is better for most practical purposes.<p>Fixed-precision arithmetic has one main advantage over arbitrary-precision arithmetic: it is more time- and space-efficient. This advantage <i>only</i> applies if the fixed-precision arithmetic is <i>actually correct</i> and the fixed-precision arithmetic meets some concrete time or space constraint which arbitrary-precision arithmetic fails to meet. It generally takes time and effort to demonstrate that these conditions hold; because one can rely on the correctness of arbitrary-precision arithmetic without doing so, arbitrary-precision arithmetic should then <i>generally</i> be the default choice.<p>This assumes that you care about making relatively strong guarantees about the correctness of your programs. If for some reason you don&#x27;t, then sure, use ints and whatnot for everything. If you do, though, I suspect you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s easier to track down a performance bottleneck caused by using bignums than an obscure bug triggered by GCC applying an inappropriate optimization based on overflow analysis.",1417602191

It&#x27;s a pretty pedestrian question that doesn&#x27;t become impossible to solve once you introduce machines. I would assume the company that manufactures the machine would assume liability for errors that result from their negligence.<p>In fact, I&#x27;m pretty certain that the average laptop with Excel is more than powerful enough to outmatch the most skilled human pharmacist when it comes to memorizing and predicting known drug interactions. If anything, you&#x27;d expect malpractice insurance rates to skyrocket for human pharmacists compared to automated vending machines -- just as you&#x27;d expect car insurance to go up for human-piloted (and error-prone) cars versus their automated counterparts.",1417600914

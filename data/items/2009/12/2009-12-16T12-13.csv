Let them have some fun and holidays. They don't need to grow up on day one, do they?<p>... further more, its perfectly reasonable, I presume, to tell them about an omniscient being who listens to the prayers of billions of people every second, every day and answers them?

998663,comment,997516,998600,0,0,demallien,,,"Again, maybe I have misunderstood, but I'm under the impression that nearly all of the data in question is publicly available elsewhere (from original sources, as the CRU hasn't generated that much data itself, it relies on organisations the world over to pass their data on).  A figure of about 2% has been cited for data that wasn't available elsewhere, but I am not aware of the validity of this figure - we'll have to await the results of the current review to know the real figure.  Furthermore, the current claim is that that remaining undisclosed data is not undisclosed for nefarious purposes, but simply because it is data collected by commercial entities that have not granted the CRU the right to redistribute the data. That's another thing for which we will have to wait for the review to know the real story.<p>As for preventing critical review, I am unaware of any such activity.  Do you have a citation?",1260968212

Researchers however don't get rewarded for inspiring peers, they only get rewarded for doing the work.<p>If we want to encourage people to disclose all their data, we need to get rid of the system where grants, tenured posts, and awards are all based on authorships only.<p>I'm not sure which idea you think is appalling, as I don't have any idea as to how to do it! One way would be to establish something similar to PageRank: if you publish a database of, say, world-temperature readings, an indicator of its value might be how many online labjournals in the world draw data from it.

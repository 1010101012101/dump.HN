5671865,comment,5667911,5671270,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The ""actual data"" is just as problematic, because they took it from the speed limit increases in 1987 and 1996. Fast forward two or three decades and we have much safer cars, which will completely change the injury data. Meanwhile modern cars are significantly more efficient and have far better pollution control systems. On page 4 of the paper Benthem writes, ""Perhaps surprisingly, the costs from pollution-induced adverse health impacts are about as large as the costs from traffic fatalities."" (Which is astounding considering the number of traffic fatalities.) But now we have gasoline powered cars that produce exhaust which is <i>cleaner</i> than the ambient air taken into the engine in certain cities. We have fully electric cars. If your concern is pollution then you would do better with legislative efforts to get older cars off the road and eliminating their pollution entirely rather than only reducing it, which would also save you from unnecessarily slowing down newer vehicles that cause little to no impact on air quality.",1367974679

If you mean ""a bucket shop, which uses as its source of random numbers currency fluctuations"", then a forex site is approximately as risky as a bitcoin exchange, modulo the fact that the forex frontend almost certainly has no lever on it which will actually cause outgoing wires and the bitcoin exchange almost certainly does.  That's actually a pretty big modulo, come to think of it.  [Edit to add: This is just talking about software security.  Bitcoin exchanges have a legal security problem which forex sites don't, because you can use Bitcoin exchanges to move money and you can't conveniently do that with forex sites.] If by ""forex site"" you mean e.g. a bank's foreign currency trading desk, you're asking me to compare the US Army and the Boy Scouts in terms of potential to conquer arbitrary nations.<p><i>what do you mean with major result in cryptography?</i><p>SHA-256 has some time complexity associated with it.  A major result in cryptography gives some variant of attack against it with radically lower time complexity than we currently think attacking it requires: say, it allows a speedup of 2X, 4X, etc etc.  (It is unlikely, but conceivable, that it would go to O(1) all at once.)  This is like every other cryptographic algorithm.  Producing major cryptographic results is hard.  Weaponizing them is harder, still: 2X improvement probably doesn't make any attacks practical which weren't practical before, it just posts a ""Warning: this algorithm will die in the foreseeable future, transition off at the earliest convenience"" notice to all interested parties.<p>But, again, Bitcoin advocates love wrapping themselves up in crypto because it makes them feel secure.  Crypto is one teeny tiny little bit of their systemic security.  It isn't the important bit.  That's a very impressive looking deadbolt you have, there, and defeating it would probably be pretty difficult, but the pane of unreinforced glass right next to it looks a little promising and, if you check with your 17-year old architect who is doing this in his spare time, he might be able to confirm that your house only has two walls and no ceiling.",1367972976

Also, nothing prevents you from splitting different amounts of bitcoins in different brain wallets (eg. 3 wallets containing 10, 50, and 250 BTC).<p>Also, a country under civil war typically destroys the value of their government currency via huge inflation.

But that aside, I definitely agree with others that using crowdfunding as a ""startup tool"" doesn't make everything and everyone on there a ""startup."" If anything, it allows people to get very important market validation which can  lead to a startup environment and lead to more outside capital.<p>I personally don't think software has big potential with crowdfunding platforms since crowdfunding success has been inherently hardware-driven. I also think developers run the risk of pitching a software ""idea"" to a huge audience where one dev browsing the site can steal the idea and make it while you wait to raise your $50k for ""coding."" I also don't think it's in the nature of any dev to do that; perhaps kids who have ""ideas"" for apps, can't code and don't want to spend the money on a 3rd party dev.<p>There's also an inherent risk with crowdfunding. Sure, we look at success stories like Ouya and Pebble who have both raised a ton of equity-free capital - but those are rare. I never saw the value or appeal of Pebble, to me it's just another useless watch with a display. Similar to a useless Nike Fuelband, but people like gimmicks and ""new stuff"" so more power to Pebble. Pebble has been plagued with a few issues as well as Ouya and I think a lot of these Cinderella stories are glorified on TechCrunch while forgetting to mention the fact that creating hardware is a very tricky business.<p>The consumer, of course, doesn't care about your supply chain, tooling, manufacturing, QA, warranty, logistics and 20 other things associated with launching a successful hardware product. They paid for a good, they want it shipped. If it doesn't work, they want a return. And they'll most likely bitch and moan just so you can suffer a little more.<p>So while we may see certain success stories in the Crowdfunding space, they're primarily hardware, tangible goods driven and rarely reach the $1M range. It is very difficult for any hardware product, even with a high margin and low COG, to make a profit with a sub-$300k crowd raise. So when you see someone raise $125k for some hardware which looks great (renders), has a great video, and a 2 month ship date - that's not reality. They're most likely losing money on that deal. I've personally been involved (as an advisor) with a company that raised over $220k for a high-margin / low COG consumer electronic and they are bleeding money.<p>On the surface it's like everything else - glistening. But inside, these things are tough. With that said, market validation is the biggest gain you can get from crowdfunding, unless you're pushing the $750k raise range. And I'm sure the Pebble guys made some nice money since that campaign raised so much cash, the HTML on Kickstarter couldn't even handle the number.<p>I also wonder what kind of products we'll see on crowdfunding platforms. I foresee a lot of informercial-like products coming up, imagine the Shamwow guy selling that crap in front of millions of online users - it could be a big market or rather, a shift from traditional dead media (TV) to the Internet. This includes the funding of independent films, Zach Braff's latest project was somewhat disruptive when it comes to how movies are traditionally made. Be in no doubt, Hollywood and all the other traditional media old farts are all over these sites, forming strategies on how to crowdfund their projects by making it seems like the actors themselves are seeking funds.",1367972744

Kids in our generation will never have a chance to grow up without their mistakes being recorded and cataloged. Their privacy will be that of a celebrity, but without the benefits and paychecks of one.<p>Here's my story:<p>I used to be a Christian Extremist (Westboro Baptist Church Style), I am now an atheist. I have changed my world views an astronomical amount since I was 14. There are things I said in the past about other religions, even about atheists on forums that I feel completely different about now. I said a lot of things I regret. Unfortunately the wonderful christian folks that run the message board refuse to delete my old profile that I made when I was 15 years old. Yes, under-aged. Even if they do delete it, Archive.org has all that information as well and it's not going anywhere. Fortunately, I used a random pseudonym username and never used my real name and there's no link back to me. The one smart thing I did.<p>Even PG won't let you delete old posts you wrote on Hacker News. Despite it being incredibly difficult to find and view HN posts from 2 years ago.<p>People and companies judge you based on whatever they can dig up on you. The more mysterious you are the safer you are from discrimination. If you think I'm exaggerating, there was a post over a year ago about employers using data mining companies to statistically narrow down which employee candidates are more likely to quit early, steal, get fired based on social media data. Sure the data might not be right. Who cares, when there's 100 people for every 1 job opening, you want the best employee with the most squeaky clean history. Especially as more jobs are replaced by robotics and outsourcing and unemployment goes up. Do you think a company founded by conservatives, if given the choice and the data, would hire a liberal instead of moving on to other candidates who are conservative? Or that a liberal owned company, if given the choice and the data, will hire a worker if he/she posted years ago that they don't believe in gay marriage? This might not work at big companies but you can bet your life savings that small businesses where the owner ok's all the hires prefer employees who's life style and views match the owner.<p>There's a reason why we have so many laws like Equal Opportunity Housing, Equal Opportunity Lender, Equal Opportunity Employer, etc... People like being amongst their own kind and will discriminate in order to do so.<p>So can you imagine how fucked millions of people are going to be in the next 10 years? All the people describing their religion, themselves (myself included), their life goals, their likes/dislikes, making racist comments or kids jokingly calling others faggot or telling ""black & jew"" jokes on Facebook are going to be in for the shock of their lives 10 years from now. The few jobs left that can't be outsourced or automated are the sales rep and customer service rep jobs. And we all know how picky companies are not to hire someone who might offend customers or tarnish their image.<p>The problem with current policies is that they punish people who are open, upfront, opinionated, and honest and reward those that hide themselves. Everyone has flaws, but the better you are at lying or hiding your true personality the more of a chance you'll have to escape a bad digital reputation.<p>Can we trust the world to be forgiving? No.<p>Can we trust companies to self regulate? No.<p>Can we trust Google or Eric with its real name policy? No.<p>What is the simplest enforceable true solution? A federal law which mandates that all websites who collect information on their users respect the deletion wishes of those users. We have to respect DMCA takedown notices, so companies need to respect my wish to delete my history with them. Permanently, and within a timeframe. It's only fair.",1367972333

This means that local production will drop off, and most things you want you will have to import (this includes the service of fleeing the country). In addition, your local currency will have become destabilized (possibly permanently), so outsiders won't find it desirable. Gold has a market outside your country, so outsiders would be willing to accept it as currency.<p>Basically, what you want is a currency with a <i>global value</i>, because it won't be affected by <i>local conditions</i>. Gold satisfies this criterion, as does USD in many cases.<p>I think most of the debate upthread can be summarized thusly: This criterion depends on a separation between local economic conditions, and global ones.

Perhaps we'll see that happening more and more. There's certainly all cultures represented in Portland.<p>Meanwhile, we're all immigrants here unless you come from native background. I don't think the original commenter is a racist person, but his comment comparing food trucks to parasites is uncomfortable at best and shameful at worst.<p>Here's a test: go ask 100 food truck operators if they think some guy on a tech forum calling food trucks ""parasites"" is racist, and get back to us.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ti-gkJiXc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ti-gkJiXc</a>",1367971425

Gold should do well too - the value that people assign to it due to life-long indoctrination plus its immutability as a valuable substance through history should help it do much better in those scenarios than fiat currencies whose backers have obviously disintegrated.<p>Food, water, and fuel would obviously be valuable too, but they're harder to carry a lot of.",1367971337

What makes you think you'd be fired at all?<p>Seems to me like your situation isn't applicable to everyone.   I, for one, fit the OP's description to a tee, and I'm pretty sure there are a handful of people I work with who assume I'm lazy etc.  In practice it doesn't end up mattering because I still ship and honor my commitments, and I haven't been fired.<p>I only feel guilty for ""oversleeping"" if I promised to be somewhere in the morning and I break that promise.

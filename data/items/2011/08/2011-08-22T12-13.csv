It's ineffective, because the addict will just find another way to get their fix, and it doesn't address the underlying problem.<p>Treatment of addiction is relatively uniform, regardless of the object of addiction. The best advice for your friend would be to seek assistance that isn't technical. There are groups like AA for pornography addiction.

I found this article very interesting.<p>I've also asked myself the question whether the old games are still fun.  I personally grew up with the Oric-1/Atmos range of 8-bit computers and have had a fantastic time re-building my old library of titles for this platform, for use with the Oricutron emulator.  I <i>still</i> find these old games extremely fun to play - but maybe its just nostalgia, rather than game-excitement, I'm experiencing?<p>Regardless, there is also something very rewarding about introducing these old games to a new player - especially if that player is your 4-year old son, and you don't have to worry about explaining blood and gore and stats to him but can instead say ""yes kid, you just have to rescue the princess from the giant ape!"" .. ;)",1314017896

The answer doesn't really matter because worrying won't do anything to help you out.<p>Have a plan B.  A big part of plan B is to work the networks you have to keep them from getting stale and expand into new networks.  Every contact you have in your virtual Rolodex is a potential glass covering you can break in the event of an emergency.  Those contacts will also help with your startup.<p>Another part of plan B is to keep an eye for where you would be going if the startup doesn't work out.  If you are going to do freelance work, then where are you going to be looking for that work?  Perhaps you should be sniffing around in those areas just in case (keep an eye out for prospects, make more connections, talk to people, etc.)<p>Three months doesn't give you a lot of wiggle room.  A lot of this depends on your situation also.  Three months living expenses could be something like $10.50 if you are living in your mothers basement.  If you have a good number of expenses then taking care of all those with Freelancing will likely take you at least a couple of months unless you are well connected.  You might try taking on small gigs here and there to extend your three months cushion and get a taste of doing client work.<p>Keep in mind that freelancing is yet another business.  It's a hole that you get sucked into and your startup may take a back seat at times.<p>Good luck.  Or, in the zombie scenario, Lock and Load!",1314017894

   top down, we might say. The engine was designed and put together all
   at once with relatively little detailed preliminary study of the
   material and components.  Then when troubles are found in the
   bearings, turbine blades, coolant pipes, etc., it is more expensive
   and difficult to discover the causes and make changes. For example,
   cracks have been found in the turbine blades of the high pressure
   oxygen turbopump. Are they caused by flaws in the material, the effect
   of the oxygen atmosphere on the properties of the material, the
   thermal stresses of startup or shutdown, the vibration and stresses of
   steady running, or mainly at some resonance at certain speeds, etc.?
   How long can we run from crack initiation to crack failure, and how
   does this depend on power level? Using the completed engine as a test
   bed to resolve such questions is extremely expensive. One does not
   wish to lose an entire engine in order to find out where and how
   failure occurs.  Yet, an accurate knowledge of this information is
   essential to acquire a confidence in the engine reliability in use.
   Without detailed understanding, confidence can not be attained.
   
      A further disadvantage of the top-down method is that, if an
   understanding of a fault is obtained, a simple fix, such as a new
   shape for the turbine housing, may be impossible to implement without
   a redesign of the entire engine.</code></pre>",1314016543

Change the constraint not to the surface but to the volume.<p>The problem might just not be ""take 10 pieces of a solar panel and find optimal layout"", but ""take a 5x5x5m volume and find optimal layout"". Maybe with a flat panel design you could be able to put 10 pieces at most in there, but it would turn out you could put 30, and at any time half of them are shaded. That leaves 15 generating power, which is more than the flat panel.<p>I really don't know if it's the case. I just say that everyone is comparing stuff on a wild assumption that you can't put more unshaded panels in a space than on a plane, and so discard a possibly valid solution without attempting to take it on.<p>Probably we would all see mushroom-shaped trees looking at the sun like Pinus Pinea[1] if it was so optimal.

They're not abandoning print (they do have a digital version that's cheaper than print) but embracing that some people still want hard copy and charging a slight premium for it while taking on a small amount of extra premium sponsorship to put out a more ""earth friendly"" (my term) magazine.

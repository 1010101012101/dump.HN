10441963,comment,10441426,10441842,0,0,robotcookies,,,"It&#x27;s a morbid fear of social interaction. Some situations are worse than others. And, for me, it isn&#x27;t caused by confusion over what to do in social settings (although when I was younger I had confusion due to lack of experience in social settings).<p>I don&#x27;t have any difficulty with social cues or understanding innate human interaction. I am popular in the workplace because I&#x27;m forced to interact with others. Almost all my friends are from work. By contrast, none of my neighbors know me and probably think I&#x27;m odd because they never see me. That&#x27;s because, when I have a choice, I will always pick avoiding social interaction due to fear. Whenever I leave, I check the peephole to make sure no one is around. I have gone a week or more without leaving my home. If not for needing food and to go to work, I could probably go months without leaving. And this is driven by fear of human interaction.<p>I can appear completely normal in social interactions. I understand eye contact and not to linger too long. I understand the need to balance talk and listening when having a conversation. I get jokes and subtle humor. Fist pumps get me excited. No one had to teach me these things. And most of my co-workers think I&#x27;m completely normal in social settings, though on the quiet side. But when given a choice I withdraw due to fear. In High School, I spent every single lunch hiding in the library or a bathroom stall. I did not know what the cafeteria looked like. I didn&#x27;t go to a single party or a single date due to crippling fear. But this fear was not the result of feeling confused over social cues or behavior.",1445647288

I guess it&#x27;s been replaced by an aversion to the whole situation, a mild distaste for meeting people. It&#x27;s like I have a lot of mental baggage holding me back, which perhaps came from lost friendships and relationships. Maybe it&#x27;s also remnants of the strong anxiety I used to have.",1445647153

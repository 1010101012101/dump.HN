Many linguists insist that language cannot be separated from culture.  Another important ingredient in language learning is practicing output; i.e. not restricting yourself solely to input (reading, listening).",1249268309

738498,comment,738221,738486,0,0,321abc,,,"According to Jacques Ellul (the favorite author of the Unabomber, and one that, ironically, almost led to his arrest) it is education that makes us vulnerable to propaganda.<p>From the introduction to Ellul's book ""Propaganda"":<p><pre><code>  A related point, central in Ellul's thesis, is that modern propaganda\n  cannot work without 'education'; he thus reverses the widespread\n  notion that education is the best prophylactic against propaganda.\n  On the contrary, he says, education, or what usually goes by that word\n  in the modern world, is the absolute prerequisite for propaganda.\n  In fact, education is largely identical with what Ellul call\n  'pre-propaganda' ...\n\n  [Ellul designates] intellectuals as virtually the most vulnerable\n  of all to modern propaganda, for three reasons: (1) they absorb\n  the largest amount of secondhand, unverifiable information;\n  (2) they feel a compelling need to have an opinion on every important\n  question of our time, and thus easily succumb to opinions offered\n  to them by propaganda on all such indigestible pieces of information;\n  (3) they consider themselves capable of 'judging for themselves'.\n</code></pre>\nEllul's book on propaganda is well worth reading, as is his classic ""The Technological Society"".",1249268289

738486,comment,738221,738221,0,0,jerf,,,"A counterargument to the idea that we have regressed terribly and now uniquely subject to the vicissitudes of propaganda in a new way, presented not because I 100% believe it but because I think it worth considering: Perhaps we are so vulnerable to audio and visual input not because our generation is so terribly degenerate, but because it is a <i>new thing</i> that there are no social mechanisms to prevent.<p>If this is true, one would expect vulnerability to propaganda in those forms to be going down over time, all things kept equal. Despite the cynical answer, I think that's actually true. Propaganda from, say, 1950 seems laughably crude. Some of that may be cultural messages that signal that of course propagandizing against the Nazis is silly, but some of that is, I believe, the fact that we are more hardened against that stuff both individually and as a society than we used to be. Of course, messages have coevolved with the media, so it can be hard to see the progress, but I contend that it is at least plausible that we have made progress.<p>Similarly, it is fashionable to believe that our education level has gone monotonically downhill for decades, but I would contend that it is likely that there are just as many idiots (proportionally) in 1909 as there are in 2009, it is just that the only surviving cultural material from 1909 are virtually by definition from the upper, educated class, whereas in 2009 the media is much more egalitarian. This has the effect of making the past look much more educated, but this can be a selection-bias induced illusion.<p>I think these two ideas are worth considering. I am actually very harsh on the modern educational system and broadly agree with this essay in most ways, but it is still important to separate the real problems from imagined problems, and to find the real causes and not the bias-feeding, cognitively-convenient ones. There are things that argue against these points, too, but they are worth considering.",1249267236

If I received a resume from someone who had ""taken"" 20 of such courses via an informal online study group, I'd interview the person simply for the initiative shown.<p>On the other hand, I used to interview a lot of college students.  After awhile, I found that I could quite easily differentiate between those who had lived in a dorm/off-campus house/etc. vs. those who had lived at home and commuted.  Students who had lived at home lacked perspective, spoke poorly, and were much less self-aware than those who had been immersed with like-minded peers.<p>Perhaps socio-economic status can explain most of my observation.  However, this is difficult to prove because almost no upper-middle class and above kids live at home and go to the local state school.  It may be that upper-middle class graduates could still have achieved the qualities I identified previously if they had lived in their parents' basements, bu the sample size is too small.  For those of lower classes, I do believe that an immersive college experience can make up for differences in upbringing.*<p>What if a couple hundred 18 year-olds formed a group online, moved to the same city, found an apartment complex owner would rent to them exclusively, and took OpenCourseware courses for a couple of years?  Would this be a sufficient substitute for a $100K degree? Perhaps the hire-a-processor model proposed in the article could supplement freely-available courses.<p>* To some degree, it did for me.

Digg is extraordinarily painful to use if you actually like to read the entire comment tree.  You either have to set it to show all (which, of course, means you have to wait while all the AJAX calls take place, rather than it sending down a page with the comments inline) or you have to click each comment and wait.  I don't know who thought this was a good idea from a usability standpoint, but they're dead wrong.",1249265137

Actually, it's a lot of fun.<p>Still, I wonder about this company.<p>It has some connection to the NSA, as advertised on their web page and elsewhere.  Does anyone know more details about this relationship?  In particular, what does the NSA aim to get out of it?",1249265119

Holding up that component as the reason that the sky is falling is, at best, disingenuous. I can construct terrible CS curriculums that start with C, and terrific ones that start with Java.<p>If those who construct the curriculum want the beginning courses to focus on algorithmic thinking, I think it's fair to use a language that abstracts away much of the physical machine. The abstractions can be peeled away in later courses.<p>If, instead, they want the beginning courses to focus on the realities and difficulties of dealing with computer systems, it makes sense to start with something like C. They can then introduce the abstractions that let people manage those difficulties in later courses.<p>I think both approaches are valid, as long as a student gets a view of the important points of the field. I can even see arguments why one approach might be better than the other. But claiming that one approach represents the failure of our CS academic system is zealotry.",1249264928

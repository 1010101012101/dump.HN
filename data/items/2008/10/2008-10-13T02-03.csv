But what happened when we landed YC was that a lot of stuff came to the surface that hadn't been addressed well enough before, including a partner's belief that a lot of my effort up to that point had been worthless and he didn't trust me to do any better going forward. That was a pretty rough pill to swallow, especially after being responsible for most of the YC application, leading the three interviews we did to get accepted and building the front end for what we demoed.<p>I certainly may have killed the startup by emphasizing things that I thought were important, but it doesn't make any sense to think I was actively <i>trying</i> to kill it. My point was that I was blindsided by what happened in the end, so now I've gone back to think about how we got there and, you know, these are some of the conclusions I've drawn and of course they could still be wrong.",1223866643

330689,story,,,117,32,alecco,"How to go down with style",,"My mentor was the CEO and co-founder of a hundred-strong successful (not-so-tech) company when a strong recession hit. He explored all the options, talked with his top clients and creditors, and did an accurate forecast of the business for the following years. The outlook wasn't good at all.<p>He spoke with all the employees and told them exactly what was going on. He made found other jobs for many of them. And paid everyone full compensation plus some extra benefits (like health insurance.) The employees did a thank you barbecue for him, completely on their own. The price was splitting with the other founder, to sell everything up to his car and some personal assets, and go back to basics in his personal life. His wife left him.<p>Not many years later, after the recession, he decided to set up another very similar company. Getting credit was trivial. Setting up a workforce swift as several key former employees joined in even without discussing salary. Within months the new company almost wiped out the competition. ""His word means a lot to us."" By then he had a much happier and younger girlfriend.<p>I've seen it with my own eyes as I was a small partner.<p>The competition was hated by knowledgeable people in the trade as they didn't pay salaries for months and then either went bankrupt or just fired most people anyway after many broken promises. They defaulted in their debts so their creditors weren't happy. And the few remaining customers during the recession had a terrible service, in particular they were left in the cold in many cases due to the chaotic situation. There were just too many competitors for only a handful of clients.<p>Think twice before passing forward your pain, be it by inaction or by delusion. Nobody will judge you if you can't kill a gang of Goliaths. But everybody will hate you if you lie and fail them.<p>DISCLAIMER: This story is not related to Silicon Valley and I don't have a company right now (was incorporating.) It is just a lesson to counter-balance some dreadful advice seen here on going on no matter what. It isn't my place to tell anybody they have a chance or not. I'm sure investors, clients, creditors, and experienced entrepreneur gurus (like PG) can advice you on that (just like my mentor was advised in the story.)",1223866298

330687,comment,330470,330658,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> I don't think there is any way to reflect on what you learned about what works and what doesn't work in a team environment without the some people interpreting that as trash talking your partners.<p>Something I've noticed about writing postmortems: focus on ""What would <i>I</i> do differently?"" and ""What mistakes did <i>I</i> make?""<p>Other people are who they are.  You aren't going to change them, and they usually have good reasons for what they do.<p>Most startups fail because of team issues.  Mine did - I tried to keep it going for 2 months after my cofounder left, but couldn't.  But then, this is <i>my</i> fault.  If we'd been further along in development, he might've felt that the startup was a better bet.  If I'd listened to him and released the easy version he was proposing, we might've been further along in development (but then, we had good reasons for not doing so...startups are hard).  And he certainly had good reasons for leaving - hell, if I'd gotten into HBS, I probably would've left too.",1223866187

330685,comment,330362,330419,0,0,felipe,,,"> We as a country have not defaulted on our debts and based on the strength of the treasury market few are betting on that scenario.<p>I haven't read the article yet, but I just want to make one comment about this quote. Although technically speaking we have not defaulted, we are inflating our currency through the roof, which is virtually a default -- In other words, our creditors will not be able to buy the same amount of stuff with the dollars we are going to repay them. And we are only able to do that because the dollar is a reserve currency.<p>For example, Argentina defaulted because they didn't have enough dollars to repay their debt. The difference in our case is that we own the dollar's printing press.",1223865719

That works out to about 11-12 hours per day. Plus another 10-12 hours per weekend -> a bit over 70 hours per week.<p>I was going at this pace for close to 2 years. The work included designing and coding the product (windows/linux/osx clients, the backend server and the web interface), graphic design (incl. website), system administration and support of a live server cluster, support (ouch), busdev, etc .. pretty much everything except for the accounting and legal/IP stuff.<p>Stressful, but totally doable.

330669,comment,330582,330618,0,0,azanar,,,"I'm appreciative of the answer though, because it raises a distinction between work in an aesthetic, at your desk between the appropriate hours and dressed professionally sense, and work in the sense of really thinking about and solving outstanding problems, and formulating new ideas.

330664,comment,330470,330560,0,0,orianmarx,,,"Well, that really depends on what you define as value. There are plenty of tech companies out there that created tons of ""valuable"" code but were not successful because somebody else got the attention or was able to strike one critical deal.<p>As for allocating resources to networking before there is a working product, check out www.path101.com. I met these guys when they did an open brainstorming session with nothing but a preliminary pitch deck and not a line of code. Being open from very early on enabled them to find angel investors and their first employees, and when it came time to doing an alpha launch they had tons of people that had been eager to try the thing out for months.",1223863363

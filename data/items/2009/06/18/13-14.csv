663445,story,,,13,11,jganetsk,"Enterprise Java is not Object-Oriented",,"I've been working on a medium-size Java application for the last 2 months. We make use of the Spring framework, which implements many of the Enterprise Java APIs, and replaces some with alternatives. Using this framework correctly requires conforming to various conventions on structuring your code.<p>It seems that these conventions preclude the benefits of OOP, namely abstraction and information hiding. The vast majority of classes fit into one of two categories: Beans and singletons. A Bean is just a record: a group of members all publicly accessible via getters and setters. The singletons are all just code without data. Not a single class has a non-trivial constructor.<p>I understand that Spring provides many benefits, such as easy testability, aspect-oriented programming, and removing lots of boilerplate. I don't question this. My question is: can we still call this object-oriented programming? I could see this entire application being written in OCaml, with functors, with some clever preprocessor that generates code to wire all the functors together. It would work just as well as OO code, maybe even better. And even then, the advanced features of the type system (those that provide abstraction and information hiding), would not really be utilized.",1245333138

Netbooks use commodity components that are widely available from numerous manufacturers. The same is not true of e-ink displays. This is at least partly a factor in the perceived high cost of an ebook reader.<p>We also don't know what kind of arrangement Amazon has with Sprint. Amazon gives a few cents to Sprint when you purchase something using Whispernet. Maybe Sprint also gets a flat fee every time a Kindle is sold. We simply don't know.<p>There's also the issue of limited competition in the ebook market right now. There are only a few manufacturers of quality e-ink readers and on top of it all the Kindle is the only game in town if you want to buy ebooks from Amazon. This is relatively new technology and the price will go down. We've seen it before with the components that go into a $250 netbook. This is economics 101.",1245330387

No matter what the truth of the matter is the only thing the treasury would say publicly is that they are fakes, that's my point. Even if a portion of the bonds where real you would never hear about it. Period. Find out from whom? Other bondholders? Why would they want to destabilize the value of the bonds they hold?<p>No, I'm not saying they must be fakes. But come on, do you REALLY think the treasury is completely open about all of it's dealings? There is a reason we went off the the silver standard. There's all sorts of slight of hand you can perform with fiat money that you can't get away with if it needs to be backed up 1:1 with silver.",1245330055

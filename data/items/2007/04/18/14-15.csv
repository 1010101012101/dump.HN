14087,comment,13752,13774,0,0,chwolfe,,,"From the article:\n""My personal practice has been to create an LLC (they are simple, avoid double taxation and still support multiple classes of stock if needed).  If and when the time comes to convert the LLC to a C-corp, the process is not that difficult.  Whatever costs you would incur in the conversion process, I think are offset by the upside you get during the time that you can benefit from being an LLC.  An LLC can be setup for a few hundred dollars and likely meets the needs of most early-stage entrepreneurs.""",1176908003

14079,comment,13752,14036,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"The issue is that we have a code base for the first company (Coding started about 6 years ago) that we want to develop into a different and much bigger  product.  The problem is much harder than our current startup, and we wanted to use the startup to help finance the bigger problem. We want to leave open the option of selling the startup and don't want to risk having to give up the legacy code and ideas which we think could be a dramatically bigger company.  (The first company owns all that code).  Once we develop the first ideas under the LLC further, we would have to convert it into a C Corp before going for investment.  In the meantime, the LLC can own that code at low expense.",1176906703

The only portion of the handshake and subsequent steps which would be different is that which verifies the server&#x27;s certificate. Everything else would be the same.<p>My understanding of pinning is that it could just as well be used in a namecoin based system, and could enhance the security of that scheme just as it does with the CA scheme. All of these ideas could work together, with namecoin as the external, third-party source of trust instead of the CAs.<p>So I guess a better title for the post would have been: &quot;Namecoin, A Replacement For Certificate Authorities&quot;",1385225827

But what I&#x27;m saying is this -- I&#x27;m certainly not an econ expert it&#x27;s true but I&#x27;ve analyzed enough of the econ involved in Bitcoin to conclude that it&#x27;s really not a viable currency and most involved are speculators or black market traders as you point out. And I firmly believe the exchange rates are totally artificial, since BTC are essentially not really transacted the way one would imagine a currency to be used. It makes more sense to say they are &quot;traded&quot;. Speculator to speculator or consumer to business straight to 3rd party processor.<p>It solves a real problem, yes, but not so much so that every Bitcoin should quadruple in value every 6 months, this is a bit ridiculous. After all, one could implement a BTC alternative (Litecoin for example) and achieve the same needs.<p>So essentially yes I see Bitcoin as a cult of naive investors who think that because of its theoretical underpinnings it will save us all. The truth is, huge stores of it are owned by black market operations and early adopters who had an exponential advantage in the ease of getting these things. Its basically like a free money machine for anyone who had change left in their pocket after spending their first crop of BTC.<p>If the system were ever to go down via cashout or crash or whatever, these people have as good a shot at grabbing the exit cash as anyone else, plus they can trivially buy a ton of real-world goods <i>now</i> through stores that accept Bitcoin, who themselves essentially send 3rd party processors the bill since presumably the processors are the ones storing Bitcoins while paying out the current exchange rate (or maybe they put them on an exchange soon after). The processors are assuming the risk because they want a foothold in the emerging shadow Wall St landscape. These are people who are putting their blood/sweat/tears into building the infrastructure that is essentially just magnifying the wealth of the founders / online gambling institutions / black market ops.<p>If instead all the rational people were to abandon the cult & quietly cash out, all that baggage could be left behind. The online casinos could instead foot the bill, and we could begin again with a new more stable cryptocurrency that has more utility as an actual currency. Market volatility adds some lure into the intrigue of the system but it&#x27;s really just a vehicle for wealth redistribution to those who are prepared to take advantage of a flawed system.<p>Btw telling me it&#x27;s gaining traction as a cult is not really endearing me to the ecosystem.

6786464,comment,6785801,6786076,2,0,aric,,,"It depends on the form of democracy.<p>The word &quot;democracy&quot; is used a lot. Usually people aren&#x27;t mindful of what an arbitrary term like democracy represents in context. They have static perception. Unfortunately, due to the way a lot of these subjects are taught, most people seem to grow up believing that [governmental change in support of human freedom/justice] has reached its climax, that the end-all-be-all form of it has effectively been reached. People then fail to care about seeking even the simplest of changes to the <i>system itself.</i> They stay mentally contained to a philosophical box.<p>The US federal system as it now stands in loose terms, for instance, is a centralized, binary, non-preferential democratic republic. Paired with its form of taxation, this system has resulted in one of the most top-heavy, enriched, powerful, imprisoning, corporate oligarchical-like governments the world has known. Wars of luxury start happening with relative ease, just as they did under more totalitarianism and deluded republics. The feeding frenzy has never been better. As long as its &quot;citizenry&quot; is lulled into believing in an &quot;enemy&quot; and doesn&#x27;t have to feel the weight of its violent force that affects others, this will continue. They&#x27;ll keep throwing their own freedom and that of their neighbor down the drain in support of revenge, clinging to the hopes of another election. One of the only ways to conscientiously object peacefully is the withdrawal of funding, opting for social NGOs instead. Even that is a colossal task. A simple nonviolent action against the status quo of taxation may land a person caged.<p>Neomonarchism:<p>Neomonarchism as a reaction to a growing [corporate-war-prison-surveillance state (<i>sprinkled with democracy</i>)] doesn&#x27;t make much logical sense. I doubt most neomonarchists want more freedom. Anyone who wants more freedom and liberation should tread in the other direction: away from these extremely centralized, top-heavy systems of today and yesteryear. To empower individuals more is to effectively disempower the ability of individuals and groups to rule over one another (who rule at the hand of a sword or by laws inherently backed by violence).",1385224599

Which is exactly why KV databases appeared in the first place, because a scalar value get in most RDBMS systems barely hit 1000 results per second, and that is being optimistic. That overhead was never optimized away because the classic use of the RDBMS was query conversations where each interaction was very expensive (e.g. large, complex queries), so optimizing it wasn&#x27;t important.<p>But, thanks to competition, most database systems have gotten fantastically more performant. Even using the TDS interface, I can get close to Redis performance with SQL Server now, while it was beaten by one if not two orders of magnitude a few versions ago. And in this case MySQL added the ability to use a much simpler, lighter memcached API in from of MySQL, for obvious reason -- the underlying database system is fast enough that it is of value.<p>I should add that almost everyone who has commented thus far completely misunderstands what this is taking about. It is the Memcached API atop MySQL. Meaning you can talk to your database server through that API from any client programmed to talk to a memcached server. And that same data that you access via memcached (reading or writing) can be accessed in your normal SQL. Which is pretty cool.",1385224409

6786333,comment,6785781,6786112,11,0,baq,,,"true but offtopic. from the docs:<p>==== 8< ====<p>MySQL 5.7 includes a NoSQL interface, using an integrated memcached daemon that can automatically store data and retrieve it from InnoDB tables, turning the MySQL server into a fast “key-value store” for single-row insert, update, or delete operations. You can still also access the same tables through SQL for convenience, complex queries, bulk operations, application compatibility, and other strengths of traditional database software.<p>With this NoSQL interface, you use the familiar memcached API to speed up database operations, letting InnoDB handle memory caching using its buffer pool mechanism. Data modified through memcached operations such as ADD, SET, INCR are stored to disk, using the familiar InnoDB mechanisms such as change buffering, the doublewrite buffer, and crash recovery.<p>==== 8< ====<p>this is what is being benchmarked here, not pure memcached.",1385222500

6786327,comment,6785801,6786076,4,0,kijin,,,"Disclaimer: Political philosopher here.<p>Most people who put a lot of emphasis on the alleged conflict between freedom and democracy seem to assume a laughably simplistic definition of democracy taken straight out of early-to-mid-20th-century political philosophy. Basically, when they say &quot;democracy&quot;, they mean &quot;majority rule&quot;. And of course, if getting 51% of the vote were all there was to democracy, I would wholeheartedly agree that it&#x27;s a nasty thing.<p>But political philosophy is one of the fastest moving sub-disciplines of philosophy, and most people who take philosophy and/or political theory courses in the first 2 years of college (or read introductory books by themselves) are unfortunately not given a real taste of the latest developments in democratic theory. This makes them pick up an outdated, straw-man notion of democracy (anybody read Robert Dahl?) and argue passionately against it. But if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing, they aren&#x27;t really adding anything to what Schumpeter said 60 years ago. What a waste of precious brain cycles.<p>Most influential political philosophers of the English-speaking world in the last half century (Rawls, Dworkin, Gutmann, Thompson, Bohman, Dryzek, Young, Mansbridge, etc. -- and of course Habermas) refuse to equate democracy with &quot;obey whomever 51% of the population votes for&quot;. To them, democracy is all about giving the voice of reason a chance to be heard, even if it means departing from political systems that currently pass for democracies. They usually call for much more powerful constitutional constraints on democracy so that the most important human rights become extremely difficult to override even if you have a supermajority. Like all tools, democracy needs to be limited in its scope. If you have a hammer... you know how it goes.",1385222415

23866,comment,23865,23865,0,0,jkush,,,"From the blog post: <p>""JavaScript's C-like syntax, including curly braces and the clunky for statement, makes it appear to be an ordinary procedural language. This is misleading because JavaScript has more in common with functional languages like Lisp or Scheme than with C or Java. It has arrays instead of lists and objects instead of property lists. Functions are first class. It has closures. You get lambdas without having to balance all those parens.""<p>Can anyone point to some good literature describing how one would go about writing Javascript in a functional style? I've seen some, none of which appear to be very practical.

<a href=""http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/publications/press_releases/musiclab.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/publications/press_releases/musiclab.html</a><p>The researchers found that, while quality songs (as determined by market share and rank by the independent participants) do better on average, songs of any quality can experience a wide range of outcomes. ""The 'best' songs never do very badly, and the 'worst' songs never do extremely well, but almost any other result is possible,"" they said. A song in the top 5 in terms of quality had only a 50% chance of finishing in the top 5 of success.<p>

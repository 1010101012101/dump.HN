There is a tiny loud minority that might argue this disingenuously but even they don&#x27;t actually believe it, they are just engaged in a political battle in an attempt to protect themselves from a perceived potential threat. Or they fully endorse identity politics and feel they need to do some PR for their &quot;side&quot;.<p>Everyone knows this happens, the issues are specific facts in individual cases and the prevalence overall.

Flying a drone over a crowd of people does nothing to reduce the number of drones flying over crowds.<p>A better analogy would be that law enforcement is allowed to speed in order to reach the scene of a crime faster.

Bad actors can be few and far but still destroy the world.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that Bill is worried about genetic engineering, nanotechnology and robotics.

9058808,comment,9058266,9058266,0,0,wallflower,,,"> Sixthly. I will pass on some secret freelancer knowledge. Secret knowledge is always good. And it is useful for anyone who ever plans to create art for other people, to enter a freelance world of any kind. I learned it in comics, but it applies to other fields too. And it&#x27;s this:<p>People get hired because, somehow, they get hired. In my case I did something which these days would be easy to check, and would get me into trouble, and when I started out, in those pre-internet days, seemed like a sensible career strategy: when I was asked by editors who I&#x27;d worked for, I lied. I listed a handful of magazines that sounded likely, and I sounded confident, and I got jobs. I then made it a point of honour to have written something for each of the magazines I&#x27;d listed to get that first job, so that I hadn&#x27;t actually lied, I&#x27;d just been chronologically challenged... You get work however you get work.<p>People keep working, in a freelance world, and more and more of today&#x27;s world is freelance, because their work is good, and because they are easy to get along with, and because they deliver the work on time. And you don&#x27;t even need all three. Two out of three is fine. People will tolerate how unpleasant you are if your work is good and you deliver it on time. They&#x27;ll forgive the lateness of the work if it&#x27;s good, and if they like you. And you don&#x27;t have to be as good as the others if you&#x27;re on time and it&#x27;s always a pleasure to hear from you.<p>Neil Gaiman, Commencement Address<p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/42372767"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/42372767</a>",1424116028

Playing an instrument is a highly physical, hand-eye(-mouth)-coordination challenge.<p>But mastering a platform - be it a language, a framework, a library - will help make you a much better developer, it is true. If you don&#x27;t know enough to exploit the relevant features of the platforms you&#x27;re using, you&#x27;ll produce a poorer solution than otherwise. You&#x27;ll use more code, or fail to encapsulate. Your solution will be harder to maintain and adapt.<p>But then again, if you&#x27;re busting your ass writing parallel applications in C++, managing locking and threads, when you could be using actors in Akka, your solution will have the same shortcomings compared to the one you could have developed had you been aware of the qualities of that platform.<p>So yes and no :-)",1424115919

Today, it&#x27;s 16% in the US.[1] Yet US manufacturing output is higher than ever.*<p>I find this point interesting and wonder about it sometimes: does making a movie count as &quot;stuff?&quot; An operating system?

It&#x27;s not &quot;software&quot;, per se, it&#x27;s automation in general.  For almost all of human history, the big problem was making enough stuff.  Until about 1900 or so, 80-90% of the workforce made stuff - agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and construction.  That number went below 50% some time after WWII.  It&#x27;s continued to drop. Today, it&#x27;s 16% in the US.[1] Yet US manufacturing output is higher than ever.<p>Post-WWII, services took up the slack and employed large numbers of people.  Retail is still 9% of employment.  That&#x27;s declining, probably more rapidly than the BLS estimate.  Online ordering is the new normal. Amazon used to have 33,000 employees at the holiday season peak. They&#x27;re converting to robots.<p>After making stuff and selling stuff, what&#x27;s left? The remaining big employment areas in the US:<p><pre><code>  State and local government, 13%. \n   That&#x27;s mostly teachers, cops, and healthcare. \n   (The Federal government is only 1.4%).\n  Health care and social assistance, 11%.\n  Professional and business services, 11%.\n   (Not including IT; that&#x27;s only 2%) \n  Leisure and hospitality, 8%\n  Self-employed, 6%.\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s about 50% of the workforce.

Programming languages are a medium of transforming programmer intent into something the computer can execute (perhaps indirectly). This is not an easy task by any means, but all an ideal (nonexistent) general purpose programming language can hope to achieve is the reduction of what is known as <i>accidental</i> complexity. Programming languages vary only in how much burden, and -- just as important -- <i>what kind of burden</i> they place on you when you commit your chosen algorithm from your mind to code on the screen.<p>Knowledge of algorithms, on the other hand, will help you tackle the far more important <i>essential</i> complexity of the problem at hand.<p>So, in a way, focusing on programming languages is indeed a distraction, at least as long as you haven&#x27;t yet familiarized yourself with the more fundamental -- and more useful -- tools of computer science.",1424114979
9058708,comment,9058437,9058437,0,0,heleph,,,"I liked what I first heard described as &quot;t shaped&quot; people when I read the Valve new starter guide [0]. That is people whose experience covers a fair amount of breadth with pockets of depth. The breadth is good because knowing a lot about what is out there helps you know where to look when you encounter new problems. Depth is also good because you don&#x27;t really develop your understanding of how things are put together and what the challenges are until you get into a lot of detail. Multiple areas of depth, particularly where they are related (say knowing oo and functional style programming well) are particularly useful because what you learn in one area expands on what you learnt from the other. You can start to really understand what the design trade offs were and what works well in different situations.<p>There isn&#x27;t one right answer though. The answer depends a lot on what you want to do. Do you want to lead a team, become an architect, go contracting, become a consultant, go into academia, join a Google, join a start up, write financial software, help cure cancer, invent new ways to do things, become an expert? There are lots of ways you can develop a career in software and whatever happens will most likely be part chance.<p>Don&#x27;t worry about it too much, except to make sure you don&#x27;t get too comfortable in a particular area. If you keep trying to challenge yourself and doing things that are interesting, you will keep getting better. Doing things that are interesting to you is important because it&#x27;ll help you avoid getting too hung up on what everybody else knows and will help fuel you through the parts that are painful or tedious.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.p...</a>",1424114976

Plus the AI has access to the same feeds that the NSA does and it has the ability to act on all the information it receives, so any organized effort to rebel gets quashed since bad PR is bad for the share price.<p>Most all of humanity except for the ones who serve the machine directly or indirectly don&#x27;t have anything the machine wants and thus can&#x27;t trade with it, and thus are useless.  Its job is to maximize shareholder revenue (as defined by a stock price!) not care for a bunch of meatbags who consume immense amounts of energy while providing fairly limited computational or mechanical power (animals are rarely more than 10% efficient, often less in thermodynamic terms) and since there&#x27;s no value in it, it isn&#x27;t done.<p>The vast majority of human beings eventually die because they can&#x27;t afford food, can&#x27;t afford land, etc.  It takes generations but humanity dwindles to less than 0.1% of the current population.  The few who stay alive are glorified janitors.",1424113877

Their lot is pretty miserable. Anecdotes: there were two or three construction sites (homes and apartment buildings) that I witnessed first hand within a 1 block radius around my home in India in the approximately 10 years when real estate was booming, and I remember at least three severe injuries. They don&#x27;t wear eye or face protection. There is dust everywhere. Children are usually brought up on the construction site because that&#x27;s where the workers live. The children are routinely exposed to the same dust as their adult worker-parents. Some times children as young as 6 years old lend their hand in the manual labor.<p>Now, let&#x27;s ask this question: If they used more machines, would such terrible conditions continue to exist? The answer is obvious: a big resounding no. There would be fewer employees, higher skilled ones, higher wages, better work practices would follow.<p>There is a reason we have the Jacquard loom and not a thousand weavers and seamsters and seamstresses.<p>I would like to look for citations, but even a cursory Google Image search on Indian construction workers (vis a vis, say American construction worker) can show you how egregiously wrong your reasoning is.",1424113866

It&#x27;s a supremely useful tool as it turns out. But it&#x27;s not a reason to exist.  The reasons to exist are still family, love, happiness, etc.  Those never change. \nThe problem is money and money is intimately driven by basic material supply and demand laws.  If you dive deeper, materials become a non-issue if energy is limitless or at least very abundant.  So, energy is actually the problem.  Thanks to industrialization and computation we are getting closer to tech that will make energy nearly limitless (between say renewable and fission/fusion tech).  Once that happens, practically limitless water, materials production, food production, etc become a reality when coupled with robotics.<p>My theory is that there will come a point where humans are allowed to pursue happiness because the individual humans will no longer be considered a &quot;drain&quot; on a limited system.  For this reason alone I&#x27;ve always thought the privatization of energy production in America was a TERRIBLE idea. Of all the cards to hold close, this should have been priority number one.<p>Anyway, as we approach energy critical mass, more and more humans are being thrown to the wayside.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way.  If we collectively held a belief that we can achieve limitless energy together, then we could find ways to help those who aren&#x27;t able to cope with technology still find happiness knowing full well it was a temporary band-aid.",1424113807

I am never above fixing someone&#x27;s spreadsheet or access.  In fact, both of these things start conversations of trying to solve problems with software that ends up in.. you guessed it, building software.<p>Single most important habit: Solving problems single handedly leads to getting long term relationships because you are more of a problem solver than just a freelancer with one or two tasks.  Being known as someone who can learn and solve problems quickly and well earns you the trust and being the first call for people who value it.<p>About skills:  If you look back a year, your skills were probably not as good as this year.  Remember it will look the same in a year looking back to today.  In a way, you do the worst work of your life each day, and that regular, and constant improvement is the only true pursuit.<p>The languages, frameworks, and technologies will come and go.<p>Value: Know what value you are adding.  Truly.  Not the sense of being special from growing up.  Value in my books is saving or making someone money that is measurable in a way that I can help deliver.  Freelancing more than startups is about the exchange of money.<p>Customers/Pricing: If you ask your customers &quot;If I can save or make you $2000/month, would you pay me $1000?&quot;.  Those who say yes to this without a single idea of what to do are often value focused.  A lot of places can&#x27;t afford a full time person, but many, can afford a $500-1000/month relationship with a freelancer for ongoing work.  As long as you can identify, compile and line up similar work, you will be able to deliver.  The consultant who helped me get my start me told me when I was starting out, find 10 customers to pay you $1000 a month.. and you have a business that isn&#x27;t volatile.<p>Learning: In the beginning there will be putting in a lot of time learning how to measure and deliver value.  This will take up more of your time than just doing the work or learning some tech (which will be ongoing).

Did you glance at the table of contents, or did you read full chapters?</i><p>I skimmed through pretty much all of &quot;Scope & Closures&quot;. I also looked through the first few chapters of &quot;this & Object Prototypes&quot; to see whether they were any better.<p><i>If you had any specific feedback on what I could have done better to live up to the title, tone, and mission of the book series, I&#x27;d be appreciative of it.</i><p>Sadly, with that title and your chosen goals, I think you left yourself no chance of meeting expectations right from the start. If you&#x27;re going to tell me I don&#x27;t know a language I&#x27;ve been using for 20 years, you&#x27;d better mean it in the sense that there is something significant and new in your book, perhaps some cutting edge developments in the language itself, or maybe an original application or new perspective on how to use what was already there. In this case, the closest you get in the books I looked at is touching on a few basics of ES6 -- nothing wrong with that, but hardly earth-shattering news to a professional who runs 6to5 (<i>ahem</i> sorry, Babel) every day.<p>Leaving aside the title, though, the material is often surprisingly narrow and imprecise if your intention is to teach the subtle details of JavaScript more thoroughly than many programmers might know them already.<p>Your opening paragraph of chapter 1 makes several debatable claims. For example, your characterisation of mutable variables as fundamental to nearly all programming languages immediately ignores alternatives such as purely functional or logic languages. That is perhaps an unfortunate choice given the current trends in JS libraries and frameworks, which in many cases are moving in that more declarative direction.<p>You then seem to conflate various concepts of scope, storage and lifetime throughout the book, and similarly do not seem to distinguish clearly and consistently between the concepts of identifiers, variables and values. In a language where closures and references to functions are used routinely and where you have some types passed by value but others effectively passed by reference, these kinds of distinctions matter, particularly to someone who has learned by osmosis or perhaps come from a background working with other programming languages, which seems to be a lot of your target audience here.<p>More generally, your terminology tends to drift away from the ECMAScript spec quite a lot, again making it less precise. Another example would be the opening paragraph of chapter 1 of &quot;this & Object Prototypes&quot;, where you describe this as being a &quot;special identifier keyword&quot;. By definition (in the spec) an identifier can&#x27;t be a keyword, because an identifier is precisely an identifier name that is <i>not</i> a reserved word.<p>The most vague section of those I read was probably when you discuss closures in the final chapter, where I&#x27;m sorry to say you come across as rather unfamiliar with the concept yourself. Your usage is somewhat casual, unidiomatic even, not least in your definition of the term itself. Your explanation for where closures come from (&quot;Closures happen as a result of writing code that relies on lexical scope. They just happen.&quot;) is just plain wrong, as evidenced by the fact that numerous languages with lexical scope do not provide closures as a language feature at all.<p>Sorry if this all seems a bit nit-picky, but you <i>did</i> just write a book about the importance of understanding the details and telling me I didn&#x27;t know the language. :-)",1424113339

How you can bring up Indian road maintenance methods as a standard bearer for good / positive policy is beyond me.

By using these terrible and inefficient methods, the nation as a whole suffers, including the laborers. Of course, that loss is not immediately observable, and hence gets brushed under the carpet.

9058529,comment,9057122,9058322,0,0,shiggerino,,,"DSC (digital selective calling), which that radio uses to transmit distress signals with coordinates, is an excellent but sadly under-used technology. Everyone should be equipped with it and be familiar with all the menus and options on their transceivers, and regularly test that the equipment is working by making routine calls. The problem with DSC is that the transceivers are really badly designed and downright user-hostile. The receiver usually gets a loud horn going of in their ears which only trains a reflex to reach for the silence button. It&#x27;s pretty much only used for tests, and before anyone dares initiate a DSC call they call the receiving ship in advance the old-fashioned way, or they will get yelled at. When the whole point of DSC is that you merely enter the recipient&#x27;s MMSI number, open a channel and just speak, without cluttering up channel 16 which is should be left for distress traffic only. Think Uhura in Star Trek. This is a huge risk to safety of life at sea that the industry urgently needs to deal with. But yes, do carry the equipment and do use it in an emergency, because it does work and it frees up yours and your rescuers&#x27; workload to worry about more important things than trying to get your coordinates across by voice.<p>I would also suggest getting a SART and an EPIRB. A SART is a radar beacon, which shows up as a distinctive pattern on surrounding ships&#x27; radar displays, and requires no special receiving equipment. An EPIRB is a beacon that is locatable by satellite, so that&#x27;s the fastest and most reliable way to get the attention of a rescue control centre. These three technologies are part of the GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System), which means commercial ships and emergency services are by law required to carry and use equipment to receive their signals.",1424113290

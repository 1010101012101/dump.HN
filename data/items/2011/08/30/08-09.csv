I've gained a lot of great experience over my ~1 year there.<p>I make $90K/year, which seemed fair when I was moving out here from a 'flyover' state. But I have some in-demand skills, and I started to suspect I was underpaid relative to other people doing similar work (although, I am certain I am paid in line to other employees at this startup).<p>I decided to actually answer one of the recruiters who sometimes call, and arranged two interviews. Those two interviews yielded two offers in the $150K-$200K range.<p>For what it's worth, my percentage stake in my current company is larger than either stake I'm being offered but, in terms of percentage times valuation, they're fairly comparable. My current employer is pre-revenue, but has raised several million dollars in funding so far.<p>I love my current job, but would like to be paid closer to market wages. How should I go about trying doing so? Should I mention my other offers? I strongly suspect that making $150K would make me the highest paid employee by a fair bit, and may be a precedent the founders don't want to set.",1314693390

How many of the existing WebOs apps will become nonfunctional?<p>Actually, webOS app devs are reporting increased sales due to the massive increase in webOS devices out there, due to the firesale.  With regard to the long-term future and your point about APIs changing that webOS is using, I have thought about this and three things give me hope for the platform:<p>1. HP have stated publically that they will continue to develop webOS and the app store.<p>2. HP are looking for a hardware partner, and rumours are already emerging that Samsung may be that partner (webOS + Samsung hardare = win for me).<p>3. There are now hundreds of thousands of webOS devices out there now since the firesale.  The majority of those new users are not going to install a replacement for webOS, lets be honest most people are not that technical.  This new market that HP has created with the firesale will be nice to sell into for app devs and hardware makers alike.<p>When I'm looking for a replacement for my Pre3 and Touchpad in 1-2 years, I'm going to look at webOS devices first because that is where my cloud profile and app purchases live.  If I have to jump ship to another platform because webOS really does die in the next 1-2 years, then that is a small risk that I am happy to take, especially if the initial investment for a 10"" is only a hundred bucks.",1314692846

Even the shortcut to find stuff is nigh on useless (Squashed-bug + slash).  You have to know what you are looking for and the terminology is terribly inconsistent between applications.  There are no access keys to navigate around either.  If the mouse is easier to use then it's a shit menu.<p>Also Apple's compiler toolchain is a POS and varies so reliably between releases.<p>XCode is buggy as hell and the multi window UI sucks (although I hear this is being fixed now).<p>I could go on but I really want to get onto...<p>Hardware......................<p>With regards to my hardware usage, I've had 8 Macs now and three extremely bad experiences:<p>a) Mac mini failed in 2006 after owning it for 2 weeks.  Took Apple 2 weeks to sort it out after denying there was anything wrong with a 100% dead box.  I had to threaten to throw the fucking thing at the idiots in the apple store before they'd even think about replacing it.<p>b) 20"" polycarb intel iMac.  Crashed regularly with 10.4 on it.  After 2 months of arguing with Apple, they replaced the logic board and it was fine for about 6 months then the display failed.  Claimed it on the insurance then.<p>c) 2010 MacBook Pro.  Absolutely dangerously retarded stupid design.  Can't remove the battery.  This is just dangerous.  My daughter spilled water on the table (just enough to touch the side of the unit).  Due to capillary action, the seam around the base of the machine sucked up all the water.  On most machines, you yank the battery quickly if that happens to protect the electronics.  You can't on a MacBook.  Turned it over and all the liquid that had been sucked inside rained onto the logic board and shorted a few things including the battery.  Whilst trying to find some damn mini screwdrivers to get the back off, it CAUGHT FIRE and was promptly chucked in the garden before it burned my house down.  It burned for 10 minutes before the LiPoly cells calmed down.  The inside of the machine was black and burned, the keyboard had melted and the screen had cracked due to the temperature.<p>As a qualified electronics engineer, I can assure you that's just a shit and dangrous design.  Isolating power is a fairly fundamental aspect of electronic design.<p>This is why I hate Apple.  Bad, dangerous products with shiny happy marketing.",1314692511

2940562,comment,2940441,2940445,1,0,jmatt,,,"I thought the goal was to motivate users and IT organizations to stay current. This frees up Mozilla developers from fixing bugs in N many different old versions of Firefox.<p>To me, the reasoning behind the change in version is pretty clear. Especially looking at the disaster that was IE6. As soon as there is any support for old versions some IT department somewhere will immediately decide it's time to freeze their version. Moving forward after making a freeze like this becomes very difficult (that has been my experience). This presents two options 1) It's their own problem and move on or 2) Continue to patch old versions. The issue with patching old versions is bad IT decisions end up costing Mozilla time. Meanwhile chrome just continues chugging along at full speed only supporting current.<p>The current linux distro versioning and support structure seems to map well to this problem. Ubuntu, for instance, has LTS versions that IT can stick with and are patched for X many years.<p>Windows users update their anti-virus software and definitions in near real-time. Operating Systems update near real-time... why not browsers. I now use chrome most of the time and I am (surprisingly) happy with their versioning. I was a naysayer when they first started too.",1314692159

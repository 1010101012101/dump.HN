4993479,comment,4993339,4993374,3,0,negamax,,,"Let me add more to OP's comment. 200 times definitely is a hyperbole. But at the time of independence India used to produce nothing. We had zero industrial production.<p>Today, India exports software, financial and knowledge services, heavy machinery, cars and what not. We even stopped taking foreign aid and had been a giver to EU.<p>I will fully admit and have no doubt that there are tons of problem. From population to poor leadership. But I do agree with OP that India of today is far well off as compared to India at the time of independence and a large part of population is out of poverty. We do have drag of corruption, over population and poor leadership. But their are voices against all these ills and I hope (yes, I am not sure) that we be able to overcome these one day.<p>Comparisons with China are good. India(ns) had always been a competitor to Pakistan. Country we feel ashamed to be associated with now. On the other hand, we are all too aware of China's success. But <i>it's not the win of communism over democracy but good leadership over poor (and ulterior) leadership</i>.",1357066724

That's not your fault, and rather than attack all of them and sound like an extreme poopoohead I'll point out the one that made me wince the most:<p>IPv6 for IPC gains you nothing except preference, and carries with it extreme overhead for forming Internet packets to do a simple syscall. That choice alone would probably cut performance by an order of magnitude at the least. You still have to make an IPC protocol on top of IPv6, since IPv6 is just transport; you would end up with the same situation you decry (some things speak DBus over IPv6, others speak ..., etc.)<p>The 'I' in IPv6 stands for 'Internet'.

Microsoft is, by centuries of established law and court decisions, precluded from suing someone from using C# through Mono <i>or any other API or framework.</i><p>Moreover, using Java is now riskier than using C#, as Oracle has changed the licensing terms for the language, the API, and the development tools to allocate to itself greater legal control over the Java IPs than Sun did (or which Microsoft reserves as to C#).<p>EDIT: Just so we're clear, to all the non-lawyers and non-legally savvy HNers:  The <i>promise not to sue</i> is itself what is binding, as a consequence of more than two centuries of US and Euro law (see, e.g., the concept of promissory estoppel).

4993466,comment,4992603,4992603,10,0,evincarofautumn,,,"Right-associative function application is an excellent choice. Perl has it, and I often wish for it in Haskell when writing long compositions:<p><pre><code>    f . g . h $ i x\n</code></pre>\nHowever, this kind of indentation rapidly gets out of hand, and requires some editor awareness to be remotely usable:<p><pre><code>    defun map f xs\n          if unit? xs\n             unit\n             cons f car xs\n                  map f\n                      cdr xs\n</code></pre>\nMoreover, there doesnt seem to be any virtue in preventing multiple indentation styles. Readability often depends not on consistency, but on redundancy, and using the right style for the situation. I would much rather read and write this:<p><pre><code>    defun\n      map f xs\n      if\n        unit? xs\n        unit\n        cons\n          f car xs\n          map f, cdr xs\n</code></pre>\nThat is, indentation would <i>only</i> introduce a block of arguments, and arguments on the same line could <i>only</i> span that line.

WinForms is easy to develop using just the GUI designer. WPF you often need to mix your development between the form designiner and the XAML code itself. It's a needless headache.  Also WinForms GUI designer translated the design into straight C#. The WPF->XAML->C# conversion isn't readily accessible, or editable by the programmer and is the source of a lot of complexity and confusion. Often typos in XAML can bring a whole application crashing down with not much of a clue to the source of the bug. /rant",1357066498

4993457,comment,4992845,4992845,17,0,ChuckMcM,,,"It is interesting how folks who come from a commercial exposure to OS'es hated UNIX. I admit I was one of them, I was  a big TOPS-20 fan, thought RSX-11M had a lot going for it, Unix not so much. Then I went to work for Sun Micro and later joined the kernel group there.<p>Operating systems are 'easy' in the sense that a small group can create them, and pretty much do all the legwork needed to get them into a product. Building hardware is more complex, it involves coordinating manufacturers, part suppliers, and the software to run it.<p>What happens then is if you're a hardware manufacturer <i>and</i> an operating system supplier, then you can tell your designers to make the hardware like you want, you can write the libraries you need in the OS, and everyone leverages the work of everyone else. In the Windows world the 'duopoly of Microsoft and Intel' led to an artificial relationship between hardware manufacturer and OS vendor but it was the same.<p>But if you're <i>not</i> a hardware supplier, you spend an inordinate amount of your operating system resource trying to deal with random bits of hardware you might want to use. Then your OS makes as few assumptions about the hardware as possible and it becomes as simple as it can in order to avoid incurring a huge overhead in getting new hardware into the system. It was this latter feature of UNIX which I really didn't appreciate until I went to work at Sun.<p>I agree with Thompson that it would be nice to have more general purpose operating systems. They are out there, Spring, Chorus, eCos, VMX, Qnx, Etc. but generally they target a more specialized niche whether its embedded or research or some level of security. I'd love to see more accessible OSes as well.<p>One of the projects I started a while back has been an OS for ARM systems that is more like DOS or CP/M or AmigaOS than UNIX or Windows. The thought was something simple that was straight forward to program, not your next Cell Phone OS or something that you'll need a couple of Gigabytes of memory to run, just something you could write and deploy code on for fun or educational purposes. It has been fun to look at ""apps"" like this. Imagine something that had a shell that was sort of like the Arduino processing UI except self contained. But again, its not general purpose. It's just a tool.<p>I think the next wave in the 'real' OS wave is going to be something very much different than what we think of today, something where it assumes there is a network behind it and that the rest of itself is out there somewhere as APIs. Of course civilization may collapse first :-)",1357066364

That's why a backend server that stores common data and also most of the heavy business logic looks like the best solution at the moment.<p>Obvious seems like a very good fit for all the B's (closely related Python websites).<p>But I don't know about Scala backend though: do you have thoughts on packaging of different deliveries for static languages in Obvious? Because if there is only one folder structure, you typically (with Maven) get only one JAR.<p>To get many JARs the folder structure quickly turns into:<p>app/actions/common/src/main/scala<p>app/actions/featureset1/src/main/scala<p>app/actions/featureset2/src/main/scala<p>delivery/plug1/src/main/scala<p>delivery/plug2/src/main/scala<p>etc.<p>which isn't very pretty nor obvious (sic!). The other option I can think of is to have one big JAR that always has every plug and delivery baked in with a folder structure like:<p>src/main/scala/[Obvious folders]<p>and plugs and deliveries would then need to be activated runtime with configuration files. But that also seems sub-optimal: I don't want to have any code in production I'm not going to use.<p>Am I missing something?",1357065732

When I am looking to learn a language, I don't Google for tutorials because you end up with mostly worthless information and maybe a single result that has any value -- and 9 times of 10 that result is on the website of the language, so my query becomes ""{{language}}"".  Further, as I'm learning a language, I'm more likely to Google for a language or API reference than I am for tutorials on how to do particular tasks X, Y, and Z.  That leads me to write queries like ""mdn {{some DOM/HTML/JS/CSS thing}}"", which oddly enough, are also the same kinds of queries I write when using a language I'm entirely proficient with.<p>So in that case, I don't think a general ""{{language}} tutorial"" accurately represents the growth of a language.  Perhaps interest, but this isn't limited to programmers, either, which makes me feel like it's even more misleading.  For instance, the only time I entered ""python tutorial"" into Google was when I wanted to see a quick few basic programs to get an idea of whether or not I'd like the language.  I don't really use Python personally (<rant>never will, it's terrible</rant>), but I've hacked around in it at work, and I never once used ""python tutorial"" to get my work done.  I think one was ""python reference urllib"" which took me directly to the python reference page for urllib.",1357065324

But lack of capacity to make the choice is not automatic, and so people have to be careful when forcing treatment.  This is especially true if there are ""Rainy Day Action Plans"" or ""advanced directives"" where the patient has (while well) laid out plans for their treatment when ill.<p>There are also community treatment orders where people can be forced to take medication while living in the community.<p>In theory there are protections for patients.  In practice there's a scary amount of abuse of the system.  Doctors use coercion (they say ""go in voluntarily or I'll section you"", with they must not do) or once in hospital patients are forced to take medication which they disagree with, and which they haven't consented to, and which they've had previous bad effects from, while not allowed to take a medication that they've used before.<p>The UK has a complicated system of NHS (free) health trusts buying provision from private hospitals.  This especially happens with mental health services.  Services for young people are underfunded and over crowded.  Services for people with learning disability are the same.

4993334,comment,4992498,4992498,3,0,breckinloggins,,,"My general thoughts about tech predictions like these:<p>1. Anything involving display technologies is likely to be way off in either direction (and you have no idea which).  In 2003 it was ""obvious"" that we'd have mass market flexible displays and e-ink billboards.  We aren't there, but we focused on drastically increased resolution, color, brightness, and touch parallax distance instead.<p>2. Our lifestyles 10 years from $PRESENT aren't likely to look shockingly different.  We'll still go the grocery store, go to parties, complain about in-laws, and wear blue jeans.  The sunglasses-as-contact-lense prediction fails mostly on this point.  It only considers the ""wouldn't it be spiffy"" aspect of the technology and ignores the market considerations.  People like sunglasses.  Similar for the selective noise-canceling ear plugs: the technology is not the issue.  Convincing the general consumer market to buy and use such a thing is.<p>3. This is my personal opinion (and I've stated it before on HN), but as technology gets more advanced, expect future styles and gadgets to look LESS futuristic, not more.  The iPhone Watch is a perfect example.  If anything I would expect to see more vintage watches with overt technology increasingly disappearing... first into our pockets, then our eyeglasses, then our contacts, then ultimately into implantable neural interfaces.  The OUTSIDE world will probably become more... I hate to say this... kitschy.  Multi-material high-precision 3D printing will likely accelerate this.  I may have Google Glasses, but I still want a steampunk pocket watch.<p>4. We can be fairly confident that the future will bring a plethora of new sensors that come standard on our mobile devices.  Everything from the existing cameras, accelerometers, and GPS to (perhaps) software-defined radio transceivers, ultrasound, terahertz imaging, and other things we can't think of right now.  What I DON'T think we can predict is which sensors will be mainstream and which will be niche.  Nor do I think we can confidently say ""at some point everyone will be carrying a device more powerful than a tricorder"".  Again, market forces dominate here.<p>5. Speaking of software-defined radio, I expect SDR will be a big thing in the next decade, but I have no idea what that will mean.  Some things, like cognitive radio and the disappearance of special purpose transceiver chips are likely, but SDR is the kind of thing that can bring innovations few of us can predict.  There are other ""disruptive"" technologies like this: nano-engineering, synthetic biology, metamaterials, 3D printing, quantum computing, memristors, and so forth.  What they will ultimately enable (and which things we take for granted will be made obsolete) is anyone's guess.<p>As silly as these future predictions usually are, I'd really like to see Wired (and other publications) do more ""rolling prediction-retrospective-prediction"" formats like this.  If we were more disciplined about analyzing our past predictions and figuring out what went wrong and what went right, maybe we would get a little more accurate in our predictions.  It's also more entertaining copy than just a new list of predictions every year.<p>I think, on the whole, we're actually witnessing a slow ""maturation"" of the whole future-prediction schtick.  As an example, future predictions today seem far less wonky and out there than, say, predictions of the year 2000 in 1950.  A good example of this can be seen in the 2023 predictions of this article.  They are more reserved and conservative.  This line bodes well for us:<p>""Look, this was a dumb idea, okay? We admit it. You know what you'll wear in 2023 to protect your eyes for the sun? Sunglasses.""",1357064335

While I do think that traditional publishing houses provided this, they did so at the expense of great writing. So it was far from a perfect system. A lot of crap got and still gets published and a lot of good content doesn't.<p>I wish I had an answer for it. I tend to look at the music scene, specifically electronic, for a relatively successful model: the DJ as filter (curator). I'm not sure that such an equivalent can be achieved with movies let alone books.<p>I do think a lot of it will have to come from self promotion and word of mouth (whether by actual mouth or electronic) will become more and more important. It's already almost impossible to navigate the Kindle store if you don't know what you're looking for and that goes for other similar services (Amazon Prime Streaming, Netflix, Hulu, etc.). For example, Netflix ratings in my experience are pretty decent indicators of the quality of most movies, so for some crowdsourcing the value of media may work. (You need a good algorithm and a large enough data set of rated movies.) Others may choose to go more with suggestions from readers whose taste they trust.<p>What I'd like to see is literary reviews that are accessible to the common reader and that do not assume that you've read the book. This is similar to a lot of the book/movie criticism out there, except for the last clause which is imperative for finding a good book rather than analyzing an already read one.",1357064284

Much of the base functionality is complete (its actively serving our mobile app), which means the next stage -- your primary responsibility -- is scaling this code and optimizing it all while continuing to strive for irreducible complexity.<p>Day to day projects may include (but arent limited to):<p>* Implementing sharding logic in our python code<p>* Porting our code to use gevent/eventlet<p>* Profiling hot code areas and potentially rewriting them in C<p>* Investigating whether PyPy makes sense<p>In addition - you may be on-call to address server issues while you are actively working (read: sitting at a desk). If/when you transition to full-time these responsibilities may increase.<p>Bubbli is building the technology and products to make bubbles. Bubbles are completely seamless spherical photos that you view through the window of a portable device. We think they're the most compelling means for communicating the real world on the flat web and millions of dollars of VC funding would seem to agree with us. What we've built so far has actually become surprisingly meaningful in our own lives (in capturing moments important to us when photos aren't enough) to the point where we would be seriously sad if the world didn't have it.<p>We're about ready to launch our first iOS app imminently and we need to bulk up the team to support things when our app explodes in popularity.

Now I've had to switch jobs and there are very rigid rules about being at work at their stated times.<p>It seems rather obvious that the whole employment culture was shaped by the parent at home history just as the school schedule is shaped by the agricultural history.  Over time this will flatten out but it's likely that women will continue to recognize the needs of their children (and parents, and spouses) differently than men do.<p>And how much of this problem is due to understaffing?  Why are people working so many many hours, shouldn't that be taken as clear indication that the work needs to be split or otherwise rearranged?  It's not like we have a labor shortage.<p>I've always joked that I wanted a wife too.  Maybe that's what it would take?",1357063483

People built that when the market was completely dominated by Windows.<p>Not really, I remember first seeing linux when I was at university in '93/94ish.  The computer labs there were mostly SunOS (later Solaris) with a few Windows (3.11, I think) machines for business students.  Personally many people had Macs or Amigas (or Atari ST) - or indeed they had PCs but running DOS/DRDOS etc.  Windows wasn't completely dominating in business at that point either (although it was clearly winning, thanks to running on IBM compatible machines), DOS was still prevalent but I remember entire trading floors where all the desktops were Sun Ultras.  When I started work a few years later the software we built worked on OS/2, NT, Mac (OS 8, I think) and various Unixes.<p>I'd say the windows dominance wasn't long after, but the original Linux wasn't created in a market of complete windows dominance.",1357063356

It is unfortunate that there isn't something Microsoft sanctioned like UIKit for dotnet. However, I think ReactiveUI (<a href=""http://www.reactiveui.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reactiveui.net/</a>) is quite close and reasonable popular.<p>This does lead into the other serious detriment for dotnet, open source. There is very little going on there because the majority of the community doesn't actively engage with new libraries or frameworks that don't come out of Microsoft itself. Hence, why I say it's too bad something isn't sanctioned.<p>It probably doesn't help that if Microsoft did deem it worth supporting something like ReactiveUI, their history shows that they would just rebuild it themselves. Effectively destroying the OSS.<p>Overall, Microsoft is improving. Just look at the changes they are making to support ASP.NET MVC as an open source project. They are just a lot slower than everyone else right now. Their research department might help them keep a few things ahead (like C#), but for the most part they are behind the curve.",1357063349

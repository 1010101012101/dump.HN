Basically, if you believe that your government is corrupt and no longer represents you, you may have the right or even a responsibility to revolt [1]. This gets fuzzy with right and wrong. You see if you pull off a revolution, you get to set the rules. You may even be able to call the losers criminals and try them as such. In some cases you could even make up laws and try the prior government members for them retroactively and get away with it if enough people think that what you are doing is right and just. However, until you win, the current government will consider you a criminal.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_revolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_revolution</a>",1312833565

2861347,story,,,2,2,pkdevil,"Ask HN: Advice on forum software",,"I am looking to create a niche community website (100 to 1000 users in the beginning) with a discussion forum. I had a look at some of the popular software (vBulletin/phpBB - also tried searching on forummatrix.org) but somehow I find most of them to be lacking in one way or the other. I hope HN community can help me if they have any personal experience with running forums.<p>Here are some of my thoughts on what I am looking for (in the order of preference).<p>1. Good/Modern UI - What I found most surprising in my search is that most of the available software have a UI that is practically the same and it looks like all of them are stuck with their default UI for the last 7-8 years (if you are a regular on vBulletin-powered forums you would know what I mean). It is possible that there may be some custom themes that provide a UI that look stylish in which case I would like to know about them too. The closest I could find to my taste was Ning but I had to rule out Ning for other reasons (see point 2).<p>2. Hosting - F/OSS is desirable since I would like to know what goes on inside but I am not particular. 
However, I need to be able to host the site on hosting providers of my choice. This was the reason I ruled out Ning. Also, some time back I heard about Ning shutting down websites on flimsy grounds, so I prefer to have some measure of control.<p>3. Chat - I hope to have a lot of private messaging between users so an unobtrusive chat plugin would be desirable (like the Chat feature in Gmail). It should support group chat(multi-user).<p>4. Social networking - Profiles/friend-ing(for lack of a better word)/photos/likes etc. would be nice purely in the interest of building relationships between users but it is not a core feature. Voting on stories/topics ala HN is not necessary.<p>5. Tech support - I should be able to jump in and resolve most technical issues but I would rather focus on managing/growing the community, so I would like to see some decent support for troubleshooting issues.<p>Even if you do not know specifically about the software, I would appreciate if you can point me to some well-designed forum sites that you personally like.",1312833264

With instant fact-checking and world-wide collaboration, science is, more than ever, becoming a true team sport. 
There are certainly innovators and seminal thinkers, and they ought be acknowledged for their contributions. I believe the science must take front stage, however. The moment an individual is deemed unquestionable is the moment an impossible burden is placed upon him. 
Einstein is a perfect example of this. Modern scientists and theoreticians hang all sorts of claims on him that he himself specifically rejected while alive. Large volumes of work have been spent pursuing avenues that had been signaled dead-ends decades ago. 
But since Einstein said it, even having rejected it later, it remains on the playbook for many modern researchers.<p>Allow me to post a link that specifically details published, peer-reviewed and vetted work that has clarified, and in some case resolved, many of the problems associated with some of Einsteins work. 
Anyone interested in this branch of the natural sciences will find this fascinating reading.

Despite the complex sounding theory though, we can see that the detail is effectively one or two-dimensional with the 3rd dimension being turned into a whipped cream smoothie. I have my doubts that the 4th dimension fares any better. Looks tasty though. (Note that these images are in fact based on the Julia set, which is closely related to the Mandelbrot).<p>---------<p>I can get behind that, even though the chewing gum strings are bent and curved in 3D, the detail is smeared across one dimension, it's very similar across the curve and doesn't vary much. So in some sense, you can't ""really"" say that it's got 3D detail.<p>That's a <i>little bit</i> strong IMO, because all the curves are at different angles from eachother, so they do form a kind of detailed fractal shape as a whole, but the awesome spirals and coral shapes are lost as mere ridges in the taffy strings.<p>So it's not <i>quite</i> only aesthetics he's been looking for, but also a fractal that really does exhibit detail <i>uniformly</i> in all 3 dimensions.",1312831165

Its got a lot going for it in terms of installed base and understanding its transmission properties. The means LED based lighting will always have some circuitry to rectify and regulate that voltage. Of course they may evolve so it rectifies it to 135v dc and then runs off that.<p>I enjoyed the psychology comment as well. There were some comments that gas didn't give that 'homey hearth fire' smell when burned back when people were switching from wood fireplaces over to gas.<p>Even without constraint, I think you will find lighting fixtures don't change too much. You've got area lights and directional lights. The designers will have fun with them, glowing coils, maybe pillows that glow. But a good reading light puts out a uniform beam of light that can be directed easily to your lap. A good area light provides a widely dispersed light without being impossible to look at.

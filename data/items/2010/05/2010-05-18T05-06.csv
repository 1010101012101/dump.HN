Its like an implicit trading cost thats hidden.<p>Volatility trading is more math-focused, but requires discretionary trading as well.  Its less automated, and requires more specialized knowledge than other strategies.  Volatility strategies aren't run by random people coming out of school or other industries.  They are almost always run by a trader with a very well developed back-end including a quant (who is trained in volatility modelings - not as easy as the books lead you to believe) and still a very sophisticated trading system with access to both the options exchanges (which are unwieldy) and ""normal"" equities exchanges.<p>Its all possible, but can you make a living at it?

The changes he advocates--such as building a prototype and getting user feedback--are criteria already part of most competitions, however.<p>College business plan competitions exist to bring awareness of entrepreneurship to an academic setting.  A typical judge is either an angel investor, venture capitalist, or successful entrepreneur.  Interaction with judges allows both serious and non-serious contestants to improve their idea from round to round, even competition to competition.  Among other things, these judges take into account what kind of leg work the entrepreneurs have done to support their entry.<p>As far as theory versus practice, real-world judges run the show.  They are the ones who give feedback and pick winners, not academics.<p>Since students typically attend college far away from where their chosen industry is based, business plan competitions enable them to pitch their ideas to adults with a lot more experience than they or their professors have.<p>A large body of entries come from full-time undergraduate students who gain valuable feedback about one or more ideas they've been thinking about for years.  The other group of people these competitions attract are PhD students seeking help to convince the college to make their research available for commercial licensing, subsequently founding a startup that licenses this same research the founder created as a student.",1274161469

However, if we <i>care</i> about things—other people, for instance, but shaving cream's as good a thing to care about as any—then we can spend our lives happier for the choices we have made. Rands wants people to give him reasons to care about more things, so he can make more choices and therefore define himself more clearly. He's not asking for someone to pick the best shaving cream, and then just say ""here, use this one, it has 10^23 utilons subjective to your experiential context""—he's asking for reasons to care about liking particular shaving creams at all. It turns out the best way to solicit those reasons—the dimensional parameters that define the space of shaving cream quality, so to speak—is to get someone to sell you a few particular creams, and explain why their ""earning five stars on the Bugnatti face-feel scale"" or ""resisting incursive facial bacteria"" facts are important. Those lessons learned, you can then pick your own shaving cream, ""like a normal person""—but you'll know why, not just how, to choose.<p>The best analogy I can think of is to music. Have you ever met someone who just didn't care about music, at all? Didn't you feel like something was missing from their lives?

What's important for long term economic health does not align with what is important for short term market efficiency.  And as a result of this, the long term economic policy cannot keep up with the increasing degree to which short term regulation can affect markets.<p>Yet long term economic health has an impact on other metrics of ""utility"" beyond itself, and we're in trouble if the power of the people in charge of making the rules can't address the needs of the people who depend on them.<p>In other words, our regulators actions are predicated on the assumption that we knew how to improve the efficiency of the equity market. Lately, the influence they have on the markets has been increasing, but the amount of oversight they have been subjected to is decreasing. The skills that are relevant to getting politician into office are diverging from the skills and attention that are required to selecting these regulator in the first place. The politicians wind up screwing the people who both elected and depend on them.<p>--<p>Let's consider the current, using arbitrage to improve  the market's liquidity  case, as an example. The most effective arbitrage techniques are made possible in part by simultaneously exploiting developments in computer science theory with those financial theory, and combining our improved ability to process this newly discovered information with our improved ability to implement our improved knowledge. In other words, in this case our increasingly sophisticated understanding of finance and computer science is what allowed us to more efficiently implement and test our hypotheses in the first place.<p>Previously we used CDO's to improve our ability to assess risk. We did this because we assumed that assessing risk was important to the efficiency of the markets. However, CDOs were made possible by developments in financial theory and implementation, as well as statistics, and the politicians in charge of influencing our dependance on ability to improve this sophistication were out of touch with the long term effects that their decisions have.",1274159577

Exponential objects represent morphisms by objects, a.k.a. first-class and higher-order functions, the equivalence Hom(X * Y -> Z) ~ Hom(X -> Z^Y) is currying, a morphism ((Y^X) * X) -> Y is function application, and so on.<p>A basic cartesian closed category alone only gets you the simply-typed λ-calculus, though, which isn't much fun. The untyped λ-calculus is of course incoherent from the C-H perspective, since unrestricted recursion[0] gives you Turing-equivalence, which corresponds to an inconsistent logic; a categorical description would probably be easy but I don't think I've seen one.<p>More expressive typed λ-calculi such as System F are more interesting from a computer science perspective, but I've not been able to find much material discussing them from a logical or categorical perspective. Instead, most mathematicians would jump straight to something like Coquand's Calculus of Constructions[1], which is (if memory serves me) the internal logic of a topos.<p>Category theory also sees some use in computer science beyond just C-H stuff--for instance, describing recursive data types as fixed points of endofunctors on the category of types. This permits an elegant categorical description of operations on those types--e.g., the ""fold"" or ""reduce"" function on lists is represented by an initial F-algebra. The categorical habit of dualizing everything in reach also pays off: the dual of well-founded recursion collapsing structures using an initial F-algebra is productive corecursion building structures using a terminal F-coalgebra, which turns out to be a useful description of non-terminating programs that compute only on demand and then return to an idle state.<p>Another fun one: Representing data structures algebraically using sum and product types, it turns out there's a meaningful semantics for taking <i>the derivative</i> of the type--you get the original type with any one value missing, plus enough information to specify the location of the hole.<p>There's also something involving a relationship between Kan extensions and the continuation-passing transform but that's really getting beyond my knowledge.<p>I've also seen stuff about running C-H the other way, and using categorical models of linear logic as a semantics for expressing resource awareness and side effects in a programming language.<p>If you want to see some of the above in action, the ML family of programming languages are based on typed λ-calculi, and acknowledge mathematical connections a bit more that most other languages. Haskell [2] is a more distant cousin in that family, and of the not-completely-obscure languages it tends to most cheerfully play with concepts from category theory. For instance, take a look at some of the material on this blog: <a href=""http://comonad.com/reader/category/category-theory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comonad.com/reader/category/category-theory/</a> If nothing else, you can probably dig around from Haskell-related material to find more general stuff.<p>[0] The best-known implementation for recursion is Y, Curry's fixed-point combinator, written in lambda terms as (λf. (λx. f (x x)) (λx. f (x x))). In a typed setting, if it can be expressed at all, it ends up being equivalent via C-H to a proposition (A -> A) -> A, which permits a proof of any proposition. This makes it easy to see how the Halting problem is closely related to Godel's incompleteness theorem, as any language with a coherent interpretation via C-H will reject some perfectly sensible programs (i.e., is incomplete).<p>[1] The CoC is also the basis for the proof assistant/programming language Coq. See also the ""Lambda Cube"" for a taxonomy of orthogonal type system enhancements.<p>[2] Named for Prof. H. Curry, of course.",1274159341

When he says he doesn't have time to figure out the best shaving cream or shaving method, I understand that what he means is ""he doesn't have time to find the best shaving cream AND do other things that are really important to him"", or at least I interpret that's what he means.<p>We've come to an age where it's not just mathematicians and scientists who stand on the shoulders of giants.  We all have the ability to do that in vast arenas of our lives while still contributing to our own chosen arenas.  It's fabulous if you ask me.<p>It's not about the fact that I can't make a decision, it's that I have the opportunity to make the very best decision based on the experiences and work of others on subjects as mundane as desks and shaving.  If I spent as much time figuring out shaving as the guy who wrote the shaving article did, that would be hours of time I didn't spend on doing something I appreciate.  It's not better salesmanship, it's better living.  I know that there are people out there who just don't want to have someone else tell them what the best thing is and that's fine.  But for me, I want to have the best desk or the best keyboard or the best shave but I'd prefer not to have to spend the time of my own figuring out what that is when there are people out there who know and who I can find out from.  A good shave is really more than a average shave.  A good desk really is better than a average desk.  Having people who can tell me which is which is both fulfilling and efficient.<p>We live in a time when information is easily discovered and contributes to a better life.  Why keep figuring out the same things?  If the journey intrigues you, great.  But if you have other journeys to travel, why not short cut those that don't intrigue you?",1274159001

10398938,comment,10398601,10398751,0,0,dave_sullivan,,,"I do pay attention to the way Russia does propaganda and I&#x27;ve noticed one common tactic is to call out some hypocrisy of the US, then use that to completely skirt the first issue.<p>For instance &quot;Why does Russia torture dissidents?&quot;
&quot;Ah, sure, like the US doesn&#x27;t torture people that disagree with them...&quot;
So move along because Russia doesn&#x27;t torture people? Or it&#x27;s OK because America does too? Or many Americans don&#x27;t believe America <i>really</i> tortures, so Russia must not <i>really</i> torture either?<p>Or, specific to this discussion: &quot;Why do people believe the Russian propaganda machine?&quot;
&quot;Oh, sure, like Americans don&#x27;t believe their own propaganda <i>cough</i> Iraq war <i>cough</i>.&quot;
So move along because Russian and American propaganda are similar?<p>Both of those (US tortures people and Iraq war was sold with a lie) are true. The weird trick is that getting someone to admit that two parties are remotely similar makes them much more similar in our minds than we intended (our minds think in black and white, villains and heroes, &quot;somewhere in between&quot; is a strange and modern concept). Suddenly, you are much less worried about Russia because the US is doing it too. Or rather, you&#x27;re not worried about the US, so why worry about Russia?<p>The other favorite is appeals to nationalism: &quot;How do you respond to protesters in the capital?&quot; &quot;They are not real Russians, just look, some of their signs are in English, they are meant as propaganda for the Western media. All the real Russians understand what we are doing, despite the best efforts of the West.&quot;<p>But while we&#x27;re at it, I&#x27;ll raise your 600k people to the tens of millions that died during the reign of the USSR.",1445000391

People go absolutely insane if you start questioning democracy, social programs or anything that a state does.<p>When you point out to them how internet or cellphone networks or taxis or a number of other things is actually cheaper in Russia (or in eastern Europe in general) because of the lack of regulations or government interference, they go in denial. People in Europe and even in the US are so much more brainwashed into believing they need a state that it&#x27;s painful to even start conversations with them. The most notable case just happened in Finland, where reportedly the police asked citizens to rat on pizza places who sell pizza for less than 6.5 EUR because the government believes a place selling pizzas for less cannot be profitable. In my book, that&#x27;s almost what a communist state with price controls looks like.<p>I&#x27;d like my kids to grow up in Russia. I like it that, at least when it comes to personal income, the tax rate is 13% (although fundamentally, I believe there should be no taxation). I like it that I have more freedom here than in Europe or the US. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the government of any kind telling me or my family what products or services I can use and for how much. Unfortunately that happens in many other countries too and especially so in Europe or the US.",1445000347
10398933,comment,10398601,10398601,0,0,PythonicAlpha,,,"One side note:<p>The trouble, I see at least in my (Western) country: The main (public) TV programs are in the hand of the state (via regulatory control of the TV channels through political parties) or of two to three big corporations (many channels belong to one big corporation controlling them and also other news media).<p>From Italy, I heard, that many TV channels are controlled by one media mogul that also was the president. I guess, there are also other western countries, with similar situations.<p>At least in my country, I see clear evidence, that political unwanted news are at least suppressed or sometimes shown in a very distorted way. For example, when the software patent discussion came up some years ago in Europe, they brought news showing software patents in a shiny, only positive way. I would accept that from a purely private TV channel, but that was a &quot;public TV channel&quot; -- and many in my country still believe, that those public TV channels only tell the truth. But that is not so -- they tell, what our governments want us to know!<p>Also, at least one leading news reporter was dismissed (against protests from other reporters), he was inconvenient for one leading political party.<p>So, in the west, we don&#x27;t have it as bad as in Russia -- but we should be very careful, the situation is far away from good.",1445000307

I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago and since then have made peace with it.  I am under medication, but it&#x27;s barely helping.  Recently I switched job to a very good tech company with good quality work and pay.  The plan was to join a startup  in a year or two and see where it takes me.<p>However, things have been going downhill.  I have  10 years  of programming experience and I would say I am above average at it.  Since the past few weeks, I have grown anxious and fearful of anything that&#x27;s remotely challenging.  So much so that I have started lying to take leave from work.  I like my work  but cannot muster the courage to do it.  I fear letting my team down.  I am always afraid and anxious.  It&#x27;s horrible living in fear.  Guilt has become a normal feeling.  I cannot bear lying to my awesome colleagues.

10398875,comment,10397200,10398290,0,0,hagbardgroup,,,"So, the reviews never happen without the marketing push.<p>The interplay between the marketing and the reviews are to help consumers decide if the vendor fulfilled their promises to the public. Critics with prestige will only review films that they anticipate will have an audience. The audience will go to the critics to see if they verify the sizzly promise from the trailer.<p>There is no demand for critical evaluation of a product without trying to generate that demand first through marketing and advertising. Try launching a product without doing any marketing at all and see what happens (absolutely nobody will buy your thing).<p>Different consumers care differing degrees on how much they want to research before they make a purchase.<p>Ask an indie film director how unimportant promotion and hustling are to actually getting people to see a movie.<p>Yelp and all crowdsourced reviews that don&#x27;t even try to verify purchasing are easily scammed and gamed at scale.<p>Similarly, reviewing on Youtube -- especially for things like games and children&#x27;s toys -- is rife with concealed bribery for influence -- illegal in the US. This stuff is harder to &#x27;disrupt&#x27; than it seems.<p>>But this doesn&#x27;t scale to huge cities with tens, hundreds or thousands of choices. We can&#x27;t know the reputation of such a wide array, and we can easily be fooled by advertising. Internet-based recommendation systems make the grapevine and reputation scalable. I hope we see more innovation. Yelp is a start, but it fails miserably because if I rate a place 5 because I love very authentic Thai food, and another person rates it a 1 because they are used to Americanized Thai, the restaurant gets a 3 (I&#x27;m simplifying for illustrative purposes). In other words, Yelp&#x27;s rating is useless to both me and the other person.<p>What happens is that people in cities tend to pick a small number of vendors that they trust based on repeated positive trading interactions. They might decide to test out different vendors if they receive a sufficiently enticing offer.<p>Yelp is not terribly good and doesn&#x27;t even make money. This is also kind of a non-problem in search of a solution: people will evaluate restaurants based on peer evaluations, their own experience, professional critics, and crowd reviews. The kind of people who make judgments based on crowd reviews might just want to be with the popular crowd rather  than quality. What crowd reviews tell you is what&#x27;s popular -- since you don&#x27;t have a sense of the personality and knowledge level of each amateur critic, each individual review carries little weight.<p>So for example, most Yelpers would freak out at the &#x27;slow service&#x27; of a super-high-end restaurant because they&#x27;re tasteless scenesters. If you want to know what the herd of mindless scenesters think is hot right now, Yelp&#x27;ll tell you. Or in your Thai example.",1444999500

The app functions in exactly the same way as a taximeter, only the implementation is different.</i><p>You can read the judgement for more information, it&#x27;s pretty detailed.<p><i>A device for recording time and distance is not a device for calculating a fare based on time and distance, let alone one based on more than that, including the fare structure itself, a necessary component to the calculation. The language of the statute is quite clear. The essence of a taximeter for the purpose of section 11 is that the device must be for the calculation of the fare then to be charged, based on whatever inputs are appropriate. Such a device is not simply recording and transmitting some or all of the inputs to a calculation made elsewhere, or receiving the output, that is the calculated fare. The Smartphone is not a “thing designed or adapted for a particular functional purpose” namely calculating fares for the PHV; see the Shorter OED. It is not a taximeter. The Smartphone with its Driver’s App may be essential to enabling the calculation to take place but that does not make it a device for calculating fares.</i>",1444998748

10398785,comment,10397496,10398271,0,0,wtbob,,,"I think that the big problem with shell is that it doesn&#x27;t really offer the right abstractions for a lot of this: one doesn&#x27;t (normally) want to run:<p><pre><code>    if [ ! -d /opt/foothing ]
      then rm -f /opt/foothing && mkdir /opt/foothing
    fi
    cd /opt/foothing
    tar xf /tmp/instpkg.tar.gz
    sed -e s/QQQbarvalQQQ/$BAR_SETTING/ -i /opt/foothing/config
    …
</code></pre>
Normally, one just wants to install & configure foothing.  Abstracting that away in shell is possible but a pain: it doesn&#x27;t really have a rich language for composing paths and other variable values; quoting is a right royal pain; by the time one&#x27;s written a <i>fully-working</i> shell script (note that the snippet above has no error-handling, breaks if /opt doesn&#x27;t exist, breaks if $BAR_SETTING contains whitespace and doesn&#x27;t enable one to override the foothing installation location), it&#x27;s nearly impossible to read & understand.<p>The Right Answer would involve a language which enabled one to create one&#x27;s own syntactic abstractions in order to satisfy the general and specific needs of software installation.  As an example, it&#x27;d be nice to have a WITH-INSTALLATION-DIRECTORY construct, which ensures that a directory exists, ensures that it&#x27;s owned by the appropriate user, ensures that no other package already claims it (except that a previous version of the currently-being-installed package is okay), registers the directory <i>and everything created in it during WITH-INSTALLATION-DIRECTORY</i> as belonging to the currently-being-installed package, handles errors in a well-defined and useful manner for calling code, and so on and on and on.<p>And of course even <i>that</i> isn&#x27;t high-level enough: If I&#x27;m installing bazit, which depends on foothing and quuxstuff, then I&#x27;ll want to call something which ensures they exist.  Or maybe there&#x27;s an optional &#x27;dependency,&#x27; and I want to do certain things if they exist and certain if not.<p>And maybe it&#x27;s not low-level enough either.  What if I want to override one particular sort of installation behaviour, but not the rest?  What if I want to install a package in my own account, as myself?  Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if I could set a few variables and the package manager Just Worked™?<p>As another user indicated, what all these tools really need is to be Lisp: versionable data which is code.  As Shiver&#x27;s work with scsh demonstrated, a Lisp-like language can be very pleasant to write POSIX applications in.  Macros enable one to create useful syntactic constructs which make meaning, rather than details, clear.  Dynamic variables (as in Common Lisp) easily enable customisation based on the call stack.  CL&#x27;s condition and restart systems are the gold standard for error signalling and recovery.",1444998268

There&#x27;s no level of traffic at which they stop working altogether; you can push as many cars per unit time through either network, and that many cars per unit time will come out the other side. But, as with many kinds of system, you may pay a heavy price in latency if you insist on getting lots of bandwidth.<p>But there&#x27;s something right in what you say. When you add the extra road you make travel time worse at low usage and better at high usage.<p>Suppose your network has an upper path with cost for x cars 1 on the left and x on the right, and a lower path with cost x on the left and 1 on the right, and the optional vertical road is free at any capacity. Then, if I&#x27;ve done the calculations right, average travel time with t cars is 1+t/2 without the extra road, and min(2,2t) with. So at t=1, which is the case usually used to demonstrate the paradox, the extra road increases the travel time from 1.5 to 2, but beyond that point increased traffic is free for the enlarged network but not for the original one. So, e.g., if t=10 then the extra road makes things 3x faster. The crossover point is at t=2, where both networks have average travel time 2.<p>So the extra road is a win if you expect t >= 2, and a loss if you expect t <= 2.<p>(If we measure throughput as &quot;max traffic with such-and-such a limit to average travel time&quot;, then if the limit is <= 2 then both have finite throughput and the one with the extra road is worse, but if the limit is >= 2 then the network with the extra road has infinite bandwidth.)",1444998120

Maybe other major distro vendors will look at Chef, Puppet and Salt now and find them more expensive.<p>Here is the financial disclosure from RedHat. NOTICE THE FIRST SENTENCE.<p>The acquisition is expected to have no material impact to Red Hat&#x27;s revenue for the third and fourth quarters of its fiscal year ending Feb. 29, 2016 (“fiscal 2016”). Management expects that non-GAAP operating expenses for fiscal 2016 will increase by approximately $2.0 million, or ($0.01) per share, in the third quarter and approximately $4.0 million, or ($0.02) per share, in the fourth quarter as a result of the transaction. Red Hat calculates non-GAAP operating expense by subtracting from GAAP operating expense the estimated impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense, which for fiscal 2016 is expected to increase by approximately $1 million for each of the third and fourth quarters, and amortization of intangible assets, which for fiscal 2016 is expected to increase by approximately $1 million for each of the third and fourth quarters, in addition to transaction costs related to business combinations, which are expected to increase by approximately $1 million in the third quarter. Management expects GAAP operating expense to increase for fiscal 2016 by approximately $5 million, or ($0.02) per share, in the third quarter and approximately $6 million, or ($0.02) per share, in the fourth quarter as a result of the transaction. Excluding the operating expense impact as noted above to GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share, Red Hat is otherwise re-affirming its fiscal 2016 third quarter and full year guidance provided in its Sept. 21, 2015, earnings press release.",1444997294

I think the best thing that would answer your questions would be direct testing, both for the experience of trying out a bunch of different hardware, and also to work out how  to get the best bang for your buck with the workload you&#x27;re using. Throwing your existing code on various different S3 configurations would probably be your best bet to start with.<p>On hardware, though, Xeon processors incorporate extra instructions appropriate to high-performance computing, whereas desktop/consumer-class CPUs include hardware acceleration and chipset support for theft prevention, basic media acceleration, wireless projector connectivity, etc.<p>In a server environment, workloads tend to need scalability more than processor power - it&#x27;s generally significantly faster to run 100 tasks in parallel on slow hardware than in sequence on fast hardware. A desktop context is usually the opposite though - running a small number of applications, each of which generally needs to run as quickly as possible so the system feels snappy.<p>It also generally boils down to manufacturing. You don&#x27;t get 24-core desktop-oriented i7 chips <i>yet</i>, because you can&#x27;t yet pack 24 4GHz+ cores into a CPU die.<p>Oh, and that datacenter you mentioned, with dual 10GbE - is that $30k a month, or more?",1444997233

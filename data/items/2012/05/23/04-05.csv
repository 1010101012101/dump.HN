Please excuse me if I'm wrong.<p>The design of this power plant probably went like most designs in civil engineering where extreme design loadings were defined (500-year quake, 100-year flood, etc.) and the plant was designed to meet the loads that would be imposed by the most critical event.  For a critical piece of infrastructure these loading conditions are quite stringent.  While these loadings drive the design at one end, budget drives the design at the other.  Most civil projects tend to be just safe enough and not more.  This leads to the realm of acceptable risk/failure.  The tsunami wall failing under a 1000-year quake is an acceptable failure.  The backup systems were most likely designed for progressively lower degrees of acceptable failure.  At some point though it becomes too costly to over-design.<p>Was hardening the backup generators against flooding ""not difficult nor expensive""?  I can't tell you that, I didn't design it.  Based on the fact that they weren't hardened, I would say that it probably was difficult or expensive.<p>Would placing the backup generators off site be a better idea than having them on site?  Possibly.  Possibly not.  Every meter you move the generators away from the plant is another meter's worth of risk.  How many redundant transmission lines do you need for a generator a mile away?  How many redundant generators do you need now that you have the added risk of possibly losing a generator's transmission lines?<p>Contrary to common belief, public works projects do not have an infinite budget.  On top of this, working with municipalities generally results in ridiculous amounts of regulations regarding pricing, reviews, and permitting.  While this maintains a minimum standard for designs, it also drives all designs down to that minimum standard.  It is simply too costly to continually design for more and more unlikely events.<p>Users of this site should be well familiar with this based on the number of Internet Explorer compatability comments I've read lately.",1337748581

4011573,comment,4011247,4011247,42,0,dangero,,,"I bought Facebook with a limit order when it went on sale to the general public last Friday, and I can confirm it was a terrible experience. Here's basically what happened:<p>I put in a limit order through tdameritrade the night before with a max price of $44. I'm in front of the computer that morning to watch my order when the IPO starts. The price spikes up to 45, then treads around low 40s. I refresh my account. My limit order has not gone through. I wait AN HOUR. Still, it has not gone through so I cancel it. Now it says, ""Pending Cancellation."" It remains ""Pending Cancellation"" for over an hour, so I try to call tdameritrade, but their lines are completely backed up with calls. Finally, the system suddenly reports that my order was accepted and I bought Facebook at 42. It's only an hour from market close by the time I see this. What this meant for me and most everyone else was that I was locked out of the market for the first 2 hours after IPO and my assets were frozen. I could neither buy nor sell. I don't think we can really know what the impact of this was on the market, but it certainly didn't instill short term confidence in the Facebook IPO and I think it definitely decreased the volume on the stock.<p>I'm not going to defend everything the guy said, but I do believe that NASDAQ botched the IPO badly and it may be a few months before we know what the market really values Facebook at. There may even be permanent damage done to Facebook's reputation.",1337748242
4011572,comment,4011247,4011247,10,0,stewartbutler,,,"I still don't understand why Facebook has such an overblown valuation to begin with. The entire business is a house of cards based on the possibility that it might make someone else some money someday. Sure, there are some vultures like Zynga that make out like bandits preying on people with addictive personalities who shell out cash, and I'm sure there are a few success stories regarding successful social media advertizing campaigns, but I count the former as resulting from a lack of morals and the latter as unpredictable anomalies that happened to tweak something in the hivemind.<p>I don't perceive any value in Facebook. It is an enormous time sink with rapidly diminishing returns on time investment, and I feel it is only a matter of time before the average user experience is more noise than signal. As soon as that point hits, I can easily see Facebook going the way of MySpace and its ilk. Facebook has some amazing talent on their team, so maybe someone there can see a way forward, but as far as I can tell the end game for all social <insert something here>s appears to be an exodus to a more specialized or sparsely populated network.<p>As an outsider my opinion is of limited utility, but I also think that Facebook is a poison on the tech industry as a whole. I don't see that they have created anything innovative, useful, or even substantial aside from this enormous echo chamber. I'm very glad to see that Wall Street isn't gorging on this IPO, even if it was an accidental fuckup that has spoiled the appetite. With any luck, this flop will convince investors to put their money onto things that create something useful.<p>If anyone has counterpoints, please post them. I write this in frustration, since I just really don't see where this ""105 billion"" valuation is coming from. Where is the potential in Facebook? What is being produced? Why should I give a damn?<p>- They missed the boat if they are trying to compete with the Google advertizing empire, so that can't be it.<p>- They admit that they aren't having the success they hoped for in the mobile arena.<p>- The only thing going for it is that it is the single largest repository on information about individuals, but that information cannot be ethically or legally used to its full utility, and most of it is white noise anyhow.<p>- The company has repeatedly shown that it doesn't give a damn about its users or small developers.<p>What makes this a sound investment?",1337748142

Now it turns out all the self-congratulation over people's ""insightful analysis"" was probably misplaced - Facebook may or may not be overvalued, but the stock price probably doesn't reflect the market consensus yet.<p>Finally, in an ironic twist Shakespeare would have been proud of it turns out that it was probably the NASDAQ's <i>computer system</i> that meant Facebook missed an IPO bump. Silicon Valley loves talking about how Wall St over-hyped IPOs during the dot-com bubble and blaming it for the lack of a significant IPO exit strategy since.

But I think you are incorrect in implying that by making this observation you are exposing a logical flaw in Kaczynski's argument. The things that you view as great about cars and computers (such as their ability to connect us with friends over long distances, say) are viewed with suspicion by Kaczynski. He thinks that, at the end of the day, these things are not fundamental to human freedom or happiness. At the same time, things that he thinks are fundamentally important are attacked in obvious ways by the omnipresence of cars and computers. Thus, his objection to these two technologies takes into account your idea that gains and losses need to be weighed against each other.<p>Of course, you can reply that Kaczynski is stupidly ignoring the positive effects of these technologies and that he is wrong when he asserts that the things that they give us are not fundamental to human happiness. To argue this, you will have to make certain claims about human psychology. Obviously there are plenty of things that we enjoy but that could be removed from our lives without causing great harm to us (Skyrim, for example). There are other things that are integral to our happiness (the love and respect of our family, for example). Kaczynski is arguing that technology attacks things in the second category while giving us lots of things in the first category. His underlying argument is that modern individuals have, through adoption of advanced technology, lost touch with fundamental sources of happiness. The setting in which to substantively debate Kaczynski is the setting of psychology, I think: what really makes us happy?",1337747545

If the victim had not visited yahoo.com before, their browser would cache the fake pin, and it would report errors when the real one was seen.<p>To prevent the user from having to manage a known-hosts file by hand, like ssh, they went the route of making it take a second visit before a TACK pin is activated and the interval it is valid for is related to the delta between first and last visits.<p>SSH takes the route of forcing the user to verify the host key the very first time it's seen, and then it has an infinite lifetime.

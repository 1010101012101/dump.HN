The DRM arms race will work the same way; it's over when one side makes it prohibitively expensive for the other to keep up.<p>If you look at the amount of effort it took to break the last X360 iteration, or the fact that there's still no public break of Apple FairPlay, you can see where this is going. If it costs $500,000 to break BD+ v1, and Macrovision has v2, v3, v4, and v5 sitting on the shelf, DRM starts to look a little less silly.",1211845279

However, I would like to elaborate on this point that you made about ""slow growth"" with a question:<p>Would Facebook be as popular if anyone could create anyone else's page? They would upload basic information - maybe a picture or two, a few interests, add a few friends, hardly ever write in the blog.<p>When the person writing content for these pages has a personal investment in the business or venue, the page becomes much more vibrant. Users on Yelp are given points for adding and reviewing places, but the number of pictures they upload, for example, is a non-factor in their user ranking.<p>Thus, I respectfully disagree with your assessment that this will slow growth.<p>I'm planning on starting with a small and well-defined geographic reach - say, one small area like a city or a state. Once that user base is satisfied, then I'll work to expand the application's reach.<p>One more thing, though - I would not be quick to call the profile creation on this web application ""burdensome."" Most venues, including several branches of a national chain, have difficulty reaching their customer base. The chain ""Chili's"" for example, has a Web site for their national chain, but few if any (I couldn't find any on a recent search) of their individual venues have Web sites. That means there's very little interchange between the consumer and the venue.<p>This web application was initially created so that people could not only organize their places, but shape them to some extent. If enough people complain in reviews of an individual Chili's venue that the cash registers are understaffed, that venue will take notice.",1211844877
200525,comment,200336,200393,0,0,tptacek,,,"The TPM doesn't live ""on the motherboard""; it lives in the Intel chipset. It's not something you just elect not to mount on your board.<p>Even if it was elective --- and again it isn't --- it helps most consumers more than it hurts. Modders are perhaps 1% of the market. Considerably more than 1% of the market wants full disk encryption and two-factor auth to their bank accounts, both things that the TPM offers.",1211844825
200524,comment,200336,200444,0,0,tptacek,,,"This is all decisively untrue. The TPM (or rather, Intel TXT) was specifically designed for this purpose.<p>What's tripping you up is that the vocabulary they use to describe it is rootkits and OS integrity. But it's the same thing for DRM and copy protection. The idea is a chain of trust that runs from the application code all the way to the chipset, or, more simply, that the system can assure itself that it knows what code is running.<p>If you take away the ability to inject or modify running code, and provide a secure key store, lots of DRM systems become quite difficult to break. By and large, they work by keeping sensitive code encrypted except while it's executing.",1211844699

200517,comment,200421,200511,0,0,diego,,,"There are plenty of companies that get acquired before having a solid business proposition. Jaiku (along the lines of Twitter) is a recent example, but there are many others. A company can be acquired for a variety of reasons. Maybe the team is a good fit for the parent (talent acquisition). Maybe the product is hard to monetize on its own but it's a good feature that will increase the value of something else (could have been Xobni).<p>Perhaps it's a loss leader, a service that you plan to give away in order to attract customers to your main business (a contrived example, Godaddy could buy some game that somehow encouraged you to buy domain names).",1211843126
200516,comment,200370,200417,0,0,Jesin,,,"No, that's absurd.  It's about the level of abstraction, not how close it is to natural languages.  Yes, most natural languages support high levels of abstraction, but that does not mean that languages that support high levels of abstraction are close to natural languages.  They can still be quite far apart in other ways.<p>Basically, low levels of abstraction are closer to the underlying mechanics.  Higher levels of abstraction allow you to think about what happens without having to worry about the fiddly little details.  It's like the difference between neurology (comparatively low-level) and psychology (higher level).",1211843034

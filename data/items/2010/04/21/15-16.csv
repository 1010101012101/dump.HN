1282484,comment,1281734,1281734,0,0,cianestro,,,"I'm not convinced reputation systems are a good thing. 1) only sites that need a community identity can benefit from such a system, 2) the system allows for arbitrary prejudice, and 3) its utilization is extraneous for building trust and admiration among the real contributors (the users so influential they get referred to by their actual names).<p>Craigslist is what it is because of its anonymity. On Amazon I usually only buy from sellers with plus 98% approval rating, but I only do so arbitrarily and rarely read customer reviews. I feel a simple comment system, like they have implemented to gauge the actual product itself, would be appropriate; if someone gets scammed that person can write about the experience, conversely, if one's expectations are exceeded then that person can say so as well. Both ways I'm comparing are still subject to slander but value systems distort transparency in the outlier data where one bad comment can destroy a newbie and one bad but genuine rating on a purposed sketchy veteran will just be another notch on his belt.<p>It's sad but since I only have 9 karma points on HN I doubt anyone will comment on this, and if so only to be ironical. Just like school or any value system, its constituents are greatly subject to conflicts of interest that may coerce corruptive and erosive behavior. In communities where karma is recognized as superficial (like HN, we're all programmers mostly--hopefully the issue is taken lightly) points are a fine means for getting quick feedback and are seemingly harmless. But when you slap that point sticker on your username things turn ugly; it's just too easy to misjudge someone based on this criteria alone instead of empirically. This especially holds true for newcomers and passersby, no?<p>Kuler is a perfect example of a community done right. The community is this perfect size and the most involved and valuable contributors encourage, if not mentor, newcomers who show genuine interest in the site. The Kuler community has a superficial reputation system, meaning there is no explicit currency or status. Users on the site build relationships, not status, and I feel personally responsible for the content I produce there. It's a positive feedback loop running mostly on respect at Kuler, not a negative one. Points should be associated to the content of a user and not the user itself as a means of recognizing quality--isn't the basis of this idea what that whole crazy internet thing was about back in the 90's?<p>Some might claim that token economies encourage responsibility but I say they overwhelmingly generate irresponsibility (if done mediocrely or less) as their superficiality moves ever closer to reality. Maybe the times have corrupted my tongue but these electronic reputation systems are increasingly turning into viable currency that some are willing to exchange real money to possess. If you decide on incorporating a token economy into a community please make sure the currency is distributed and controlled by the users. I not sure if anyone else out there does this but every time I use craigslist I quietly mutter under my breath ""Thank you Craig for keeping it simple.""",1271865037

I offer a chance to fix it and single payer advocates run away.<p>However, if you think that medicare is fine, then my offer lets you extend it to federal workers, the VA, and so on.  And we get to observe.<p>And you get to deliver on the promise of lower costs.  Since medicare isn't cheaper (I'll deal with overhead below) and delivers worse care....<p>Of course, you also have the problem that doctors who have a choice tend to flee medicare.  If the private insurers are so hard to deal with, what does that say about govt?<p>> Medicare is actually run at lower cost than most private insurance companies.<p>Actually, it isn't.  Medicare spends less money on one specific category of ""overhead"", but it spends far more on others.  (Govt's overall spending per covered person is basically the same as the private system's spending.  Medicare is actually worse than average for delivery vs cost.)<p>For example, the credible total medicare fraud estimates range from $150B to $250B/year.  (The low number is from AG Holder, who said ""more than"".)<p>This is despite the fact that folks who raise disputes with medicare are less likely to win than folks who have disputes with the private system.  What a deal - more fraud and more denied coverage.<p>The total profit of the private system is >$10B/year.  And no, adding ""executive salaries"" doesn't significantly change that number.<p>The medicare fraud number alone dwarfs the supposed overhead of the private system, and the private system is bigger than medicare.<p>I'm sure that you've seen the ""free medical equipment"" ads on TV.  That equipment isn't free, it's paid by medicare/medicaid.  Care to argue that it's mostly medically necessary?<p>Free rein lets you fix this, if it can be fixed.

Finally, many of the students in middling schools shouldn't be in college at all, while the assumption at an elite college is that the person who's late is a good student with a good reason.

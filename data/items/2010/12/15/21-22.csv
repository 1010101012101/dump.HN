2009971,comment,2003567,2003567,0,0,tyrmored,,,"New PHP developer here. Just some perspective from an ""industry"" guy rather than a super-smart startup guy. I can clearly remember my first foray into Rails, and it'll be a while before I try it again unless I need it for a job. I just don't like it, and here's why.<p>For people like me, Rails is at least at first glance very unsettling. I followed the tutorial on their site about making a guestbook, on which they proudly boast how fast you'll have it up and running. So I punched in the code they suggested and bang, guestbook. They certainly weren't lying (maybe exaggerating a tad) about the speed, but ...<p>Wait. What the fuck? You've made a <i>lot</i> of assumptions about how I wanted this to work. What say I didn't want the form to look like that? Why are you writing CSS for me? That's <i>my</i> job! Going further into it made me feel even more uncomfortable, and after seeing the ORM database abstraction and taking my beloved SQL away from me, I left Rails behind.<p>It's one thing to provide a clever wrapper method to efficiently sort integers in PHP or Ruby without having to import or implement quicksort or whatever. That's abstraction me and my self-taught ilk are comfortable with. But the way Rails assumes what you meant from your code is just distressing. You don't feel like you wrote it, and this code is running and producing a finished webpage without you needing to understand how it works. You could reasonably respond that this is just another layer of abstraction, but producing an entire webpage for you based on some very cursory instruction does not have the same ""pure"" feel that a sort() implementation does.<p>My friends think it's great. I think it's scary. And reading some other elated posts from Rails nuts around the web about the whole ""just works"" thing and the magic going on really <i>is</i> unsettling. You're not building from the bottom up -- schema -> logic -> markup -> style -> scripts. It's all coming together in one big vaguely uncomfortable clump, and <i>you didn't write it</i>. Anything more than a vim macro/TextMate snippet or two that generates code for me -- even if I can edit it afterwards -- gives me a cold shiver, and makes me feel like I'm using Dreamweaver again.<p>You could read the code to see what it's doing and tweak accordingly, but then, why not write the code yourself in the first place?",1292449912

2009966,story,,,2,0,Skywing,"Review my Idea: Email-based database service",,"<i>I brought up this idea in a post earlier this morning, but it was around 2am and it quickly scrolled off the front pages. I don't think many people may have seen it so I wanted to post it one last time before moving on.</i><p>I've been thinking about this idea over the past few days. I've even already written code for it and have a functional prototype. But, everyone I tell the idea to doesn't seem to grasp the concept or just can't see why it would be useful.<p>My idea is simple. The idea: a hosted database service (a la MongoHQ) with an easy and highly accessible CRUD interface via SMTP (a la Posterous). It would be accompanied by an API for CRUD, also - perhaps REST.<p>The idea came to me while thinking about writing my own SMTP-based blog, like Posterous. I wanted to write my own blog that I was able to write to using any email client I had, instead of using some annoying WYSIWYG editor. But then a friend suggested, ""why not generalize it for more than just blogs""? I'm not sure to what extent he meant, but I immediately envisioned something similar to Posterous but more generalized. Basically, a database that anyone could perform CRUD on using their email client.<p>Why email? Everyone has it. It's easily accessible. There are email client implementations in pretty much every environment you can think of.<p>It obviously wouldn't be for heavy read/write traffic database applications, but more for casual users that don't fully understand the internal workings of how to use their own database. It could perhaps be used by myself to write my own Posterous-esque blogging platform. It could be used for email storage and backup. It could be use for file sharing, backing up files with associated meta data. A simple API could provide non-SMTP read access to your data - perhaps REST.<p>I feel like this idea excites me because of two reasons, A) it has a clear cut hosting-based business plan, which none of my ideas ever do, and B) I don't even know if I fully know how this is entirely useful or what the applications of it could be. I haven't gotten very good feedback on it, though. So, what you think about this?<p>Here is what I have running for it so far. It's just something I wrote in a single afternoon as kind of a proof of concept for myself. I wrote a simple SMTP server that does nothing but handling incoming emails and performs some simple, crude authentication on them. Authentication is done by signing up on the site, downloading the provided ""db.auth"" file. To submit data to the database, address an email to ""db@collabreate.co"" and attach the ""db.auth"" file. The records will appear on the website. There is no other functionality in this demo.<p>http://collabreate.co:8080/records/<p>The domain is just something I use to play with - it's not related to this particular idea.<p>So, what do you all think? :P",1292449868

I was also an overachiever in high school who came home at 10pm from gymnastics, did homework, slept 4 hours and did it all over again.  I went to a super-competitive high school, stressed over my GPA to two decimal places, got into the top schools etc.<p>Looking back, I did it out of something that I can only describe as pure competitive drive.  I did it because I had to do well.  I was concerned far more often about being a winner than about identifying and achieving a particular thing that I really care about.<p>But winning felt good!<p>I seem to have forgotten that since I came to college.  My mindset for the past three or so years has been ""I don't compete with others.  I'll figure out what's really important to <i>me</i> and I'll work hard to achieve that.""  The result?  I haven't figured out what's important to me.  I don't feel like I've been a winner in many things because I've allowed myself to think I don't care about winning at those things.  For example, I have allowed myself to say ""I don't really care about algorithms"" and gotten Bs and Cs in algorithms.<p>I tell myself that blindly winning at the wrong thing for the sake of winning could make me unhappy in the long run, that I should slow down and explore and figure out some real goals first.  Yet it sounds a lot like a lame excuse, and it's even more difficult to do when one feels that one is ""falling behind"" compared to one's peers.<p>My conclusion is still that simply making it happen may be too superficial.  It was for me.  A substantial question is <i>what</i> you want to make happen and why.",1292449299

We already have some pretty good prototypes.<p>We've had pretty good prototypes for more than 20 years.  There are two huge barriers:<p>(1) The progress in computer vision, like voice recognition, has slowed.  People had pretty good speech recognition since the 1980's, but the gap between ""pretty good"" and ""good enough to use"" remains uncrossed.  The gap in computer vision for cars will be even wider because mistakes will be much more costly.<p>(2)  Even with all the tech problems solved, the regulatory hurdles to implementing this are staggering.<p>Suffice it to say, I would make a ""Long Bet"" (longbets.org/) against autonomous cars making up 5% of all cars in 20 years, with 10:1 odds.<p>> Additionally, what would be those massively positive effects?<p>Car accidents cost the US about $250 Billion per year, with 45,000 killed.  Autonomous driving has the potential to decrease this by at least an order of magnitude (most accidents are due to driver error).  That's a <i>mind-bogglingly staggering</i> benefit.<p>10 million Americans commute more than an hour each day, which is $25 Billion per year at <i>minimum</i> wage.  There's much more lost among the rest of the commuters, and a factor of 4 to account for realistic wages.<p>I could go on about how autonomous driving would also (a) drastically reduce the total number of cars we'd need, (b) cut emissions and gas usage by allowing ubiquitous slip streaming, (c) virtually eliminate the need for nearby parking in cities, freeing up vast amounts of extremely valuable real estate.",1292448961

This entailed custom FPGA boards with gobs of custom and innovative Verilog code to make it all go.  We also took pride in designing a very nice lightweight aluminum enclosure for the product.  Price was about US $8,000.  All up, about a year and a half of development time and a non-trivial financial investment.<p>The product was introduced at this trade-show and it was a success.  However, of the hundreds of people I spoke to at the booth only one made a lasting impression that I remember ten years later.  This Italian buyer comes over to get a demo.  After a 20 minute presentation he asks for the price.  Then he picks-up the unit and says:  ""8000 dollars!  Why so light!"".<p>He actually thought we were charging too much based on how light the thing was.  Never mind that there was a year and a half of heavy-duty development behind it.  He had a mental image of what an $8,000 product was supposed to weigh and that was the end of it.<p>We switched to heavier steel enclosures (cheaper too!).

2009790,comment,2009401,2009401,0,0,wtallis,,,"It's interesting how Adobe's excuses have been shifting since Apple kicked Flash criticism in to high gear.<p>A year ago, they were complaining that they needed low-level access to GPU decoding engines in order to make Flash play videos with acceptable CPU load. Apple gave them exactly the API they asked for, and Flash performance on OS X still sucked, especially for people who didn't have one of the supported GPUs.<p>They've mostly settled now on the excuse being that Flash has to do color-space conversions and compositing on the CPU, though this post adds the extra apologetic twist that they never intended Flash to become the standard way of delivering streaming video over the web.<p>The compositing excuse strikes me as pure bullshit, because a Flash video that is playing with no non-video elements overlaid and doesn't have input focus still eats up too much CPU, despite the compositing stage being a no-op.<p>The YUV to RGB conversion is obviously not complicated enough to make much difference to the CPU load, because standalone players that do all the decoding and color space conversions in software easily achieve less than 1/5 the CPU load of Flash, and the actual decoding has got to be at least 70% of that work.<p>Last spring, we were told that Flash's inefficiencies were partly due to browser plugin APIs being poorly suited to the task. There has been no intervening revolution in such APIs, so that can't be the source of the new improvements enabled by this StageVideo feature.<p>The only documentation that seems to be available at the moment for StageVideo is a flash video tutorial, and the text in that video uses subpixel rendering with the opposite subpixel ordering from my monitor, so I can't read it without getting a headache. That said, it appears that this StageVideo feature requires the flash object to be modified, so it won't provide any immediate real-world benefits, and it requires the flash designer to code in the fallback rendering path for people who don't have the right kind of GPU.<p>Meanwhile, OS X still has an API for playing videos that will automatically decide whether to use hardware-accelerated decoding, and an OpenGL-backed vector graphics API that can handle all the compositing needs for Flash. These APIs have broader hardware support than StageVideo.<p>One gets the feeling that Adobe doesn't want to fix any of the suck, just to move past it.",1292447300

Not just by clicking/hovering the text. Makes it much easier to hit, and again makes it clear that the thing is a tab/widget and not a simple text hyperlink.",1292447299

His own personal experience is really the whole point here.<p>He's stating his credentials, which is important — lots of people are happy to offer advice on how to ""be successful"" or ""win"", and that advice is contradictory.  As an empiricist, I think it's very useful to examine the results they report from applying that advice in their own lives in order to figure out what its results are likely to be if I apply it in my own.<p>Of course, people's reports of their personal experience are not perfectly reliable, but they're a lot more reliable than their ability to accurately derive explanatory theories from their personal experience.<p>As far as I can tell, the achievement Jason Shen is most proud of is working, as a non-founder, at a six-person startup that sells ads.  If you dig a bit, it turns out he also cofounded a microfinance group in 2007 that has lent US$24,000 over the last three years, but says, ""Microfinance isn't a panacea. We don't think of ourselves as changing the world. We're just making it a bit chewier.""  As far as I know, the difference between traditional low-income loan-sharking (you know, payday loans and so on) and microfinance is specifically the intention to change the world. (On the plus side, they do claim they're working to ""end poverty"" but I can't find any description of their actual program on their website. At first I thought <a href=""http://gumballcapital.org/challenge/qanda/question/8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gumballcapital.org/challenge/qanda/question/8/</a> meant they were making high-interest loans to undergraduates at elite US universities, but it seems more likely that the ""Challenge"" is a way for them to solicit donations, not their actual program.)<p>In short, nothing Jason Shen has accomplished so far in his life will be remembered a century from now, unless he becomes famous for something he does in the future.<p>To me, this provides a very valuable lesson: you can work insanely hard for years and years, practicing and studying 17 hours a day, and even think you're an expert on ""winning"", without ever achieving anything significant.  <i>Hard work is not enough.</i>",1292447147

Athletes are easy examples to look at because they compete so directly and much is written about them.  If you look at a Michael Jordan or a Tiger Woods you'll of course find talent, but also an unrelenting competitive drive that made them practice for hours and hours a day.  Their practice schedules were/are not normal even for the professional athlete level.<p>There is a good quote from a forgettable rap song:<p><i>Losers make excuses, winners make it happen</i><p>The author of the blog post made it happen even if he wasn't aware of doing it at the time.",1292447092

And that is the point. No one else cares as much. Of course it took ages, because anything worth doing does.

Ive&#x27;s ego and insistence on exalting his own genius at the expense of others&#x27; is maddening, and to call something so simple an &quot;innovation&quot; illustrates how little is necessary for something to be deemed a work of ingenuity.<p>Like Marc Newson, much of his work is design for the sake of design, with little regard for functional implications. To have a company&#x27;s philosophy be singularly focussed on aesthetics and minimalism alone is not a bad thing. But as Larry Wall prophetically said several years ago, &quot;Apple is the arbiter of good taste. But when good taste becomes mandatory, it&#x27;s no longer good taste, just manners.&quot;<p>I feel similarly about Apple&#x27;s design philosophy. Their level of influence doesn&#x27;t inspire opposing philosophies from their competitors, it inspires imitation-- since imitation is a basic, natural, fundamental reaction to something successful. The problem is that it alienates those who have other requirements that differ vastly from those of Apple&#x27;s, and who would be better served with a little less aesthetic sense, and more functionality or durability at the expense of (largely arbitrary) things such as thickness, gloss, polish, and shine.<p>There is a reason you only see ThinkPads on ISS rather than MacBooks.

When Mozilla.org was created, the best way to achieve those goals was by having an awesome libre browser.

For example, it&#x27;s entirely possible in Rust to have implemented Add for i32 and String.

C&#x27;s number types do this. PHP does this on everything. Javascript has, eg., [] + [] == &quot;&quot;. Python does not do this - all type casts are explicit in the implementation of the operator or function (which is implemented on the type, not globally).<p>It&#x27;s reasonable to argue that the use of the phrase &quot;weak typing&quot; to mean &quot;things I don&#x27;t like about a type-system&quot; is not only well established but maybe even more useful.

9601956,comment,9600584,9601173,0,0,gyardley,,,"The author is correct.<p>Honestly, during the entire Cold War every American university was pumping up the size of their Slavic Studies department - hiring professors left and right. While it certainly wasn&#x27;t required, studying the Russian language, history, and literature was a fairly popular thing to do, and there certainly weren&#x27;t any political problems with either teaching or studying it. Anything academic relating to Eastern Europe was funded very generously by the federal government, and with a background in Russian you could go on to get a respectable career in that same government.<p>After the Cold War ended, the funding dried up, Russian stopped being such a desirable specialty for government work, and the tenured Slavic Studies professors who retired stopped being replaced. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing - the size of the field was artificially inflated and now is returning to a somewhat more rational level.",1432592208

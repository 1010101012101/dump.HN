Annualized as a full time job that&#x27;s $125k/yr. not terrible, but quite a bit less than what a good developer can make as base salary at a tech company. But that tech company job comes with benefits, paid vacation, stability, and possibly equity and bonuses. Plus the freelance gigs are rarely actually full time (even if you have enough clients on a steady basis, you need some time to manage the business itself).

An area that has become a standard stop as the second holiest place in Islam in the muslim pilgrimage?<p>I do agree with you, that&#x27;s the Saudi position and the green dome is an exception (which may one day end up stopping to be an exception), but so far they&#x27;ve spared it despite various calls to destroy it in the past, and rather have expanded the site in a massive way (not the tomb, but the mosque around it, which is visited becomes of veneration of Mohamed and visits to the tomb). If you had named any other person you&#x27;d have been right, but so far Mohamed seems to be an exception to the rule.<p>Regardless I don&#x27;t think it mattered much. Take the holy site in Shia islam, the shrine of Husain ibn Ali for example, was first believed to have been marked with a berry tree. A few years later, a mosque was built, which roughly 100 years later was demolished and the berry tree cut down. People still kept visiting guided (it is said), by the traces of the berry tree. The caliph then ordered the tree to be cut out from the root to stop people from visiting. A few decades later a new mosque was built, which a few decades later still was destroyed and the land ordered to be ploughed (including the grave). Stuff like this went on for centuries, with new mosques being built and destroyed for political or religious reasons. I&#x27;m doubtless as to whether OBL&#x27;s burial sight would&#x27;ve become a place of visitation and propaganda, it&#x27;d be inevitable to have created some following even if it was merely marked by GPS and barely any structure could be found at the sight because any structures would get removed.

Otherwise it&#x27;s silly to do freelancing over taking a job. All those dreams of being your own boss and choosing your own hours is B.S. All that matters is that you are able to get more earnings than you would if you were working a job. All of the above is stuff that you don&#x27;t have to deal with in a real job.<p>Also, you are making life easy for your employer if you are able to deliver high quality work at no risk and headache of doing an actual hire. That&#x27;s worth a good premium by itself.<p>But all that is the wrong mind-set. You need to make sure that you are putting yourself not in a position of being a commodity. You need to be delivering on problems that can&#x27;t necessarily be solved by throwing money at them.

They can get whatever they are looking for. You aren&#x27;t what they are looking for, yet you still find yourself in the same market. That&#x27;s fine, just pretend they don&#x27;t exist. You don&#x27;t negotiate because you aren&#x27;t a commodity. You are providing solutions that can&#x27;t be bought.

This is largely arbitrary anyways. Nobody knows how many hours the project really requires and the more expensive programmer may get the project done in half the time. Or that developer may save that much time through maintenance in the long term. Software scales, hours don&#x27;t, the difference shouldn&#x27;t come into play. Pay the developer a sufficient professional rate.<p>Boot-strappers with little money shouldn&#x27;t be hiring people. They need to roll their sleeves and do some coding themselves. And how much is that time worth? It&#x27;s probably worth about the same as the hourly freelancer they would be looking to hire (or more) and they are losing that money in opportunity costs.

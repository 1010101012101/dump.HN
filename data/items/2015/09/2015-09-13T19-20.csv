If Unicode were &quot;just&quot; about rendering pre-made glyphs consistently it would not be nearly so hard, but it aims to do more - sorting, capitalization, string length - and that&#x27;s also why it tends to fall over in production systems. Nobody is ever going to get Unicode completely right, just a subset of it for the languages they&#x27;ve successfully localized.<p>The simplest character encoding you could hope to work with is something like a single-line calculator or vending machine display - fixed-width, no line breaks, just the Arabic numerals and maybe a decimal point, some mathematical symbols, or a limited English alphabet to display &quot;INSERT CASH&quot;. Any featureset above that produces issues. Just line breaks alone are responsible for all sorts of strange behaviors.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bit magical that we&#x27;ve managed to do so much with text given the starting situation. At each step - from early telegram encodings through the proliferation of emoji - the implementations had to codify a thing that was previously left open, develop rules around its use, etc. We&#x27;ve made language more systematic than it ever was in history, for the benefit of machines to parse and process it.",1442174130

You are not revealing some big conspiracy here, it&#x27;s a well-understood exchange<p>I&#x27;m not sure Google&#x27;s funding and mission is widely understood in the west, even amongst the tech-literate.

I&#x27;m not being sarcastic, I really would appreciate a link if you have one. I have read some arguments about why the Russian submarine captain was not actually committed to using the nuclear torpedo, but nothing about the risk of escalation having been low.<p>Based on my memory of the Cold War literature, there was quite a bit of concern about a naval nuclear exchange triggering strategic nuclear war. A quick search seemed to confirm my recollection: &quot;[T]he doctrines and operational procedures associated with sea-based nuclear weapons are subject to less well-defined thresholds and, in some cases, are quite provocative. Moreover, there are good reasons for believing that the first use of nuclear weapons could take place at sea, and for concern that the escalation dynamics of nuclear warfare in this theater are far less constrained than those that would attend nuclear operations on land.&quot; (Ball, Desmond. &quot;Nuclear war at sea.&quot; <i>International Security</i> (1985): 3-31.)<p>The risk of escalation would have been intensified during the missile crisis, because the underlying dispute involved strategic weapons. If a Soviet nuclear weapon destroyed an American carrier battle group, at minimum the U.S. would have retaliated with tactical nuclear weapons. And there would be significant pressure to target land-based military installations in order to achieve a proportionate response, because the Soviets were so much less dependent on their Navy than the U.S. At that point, all bets are off, particularly given the Soviet&#x27;s proclivity for interpreting any American action in the worst possible light.<p>Escalation to extinction-level global nuclear war was certainly not guaranteed, but it was arguably the most probable outcome. One cannot reasonably dispute that it was well within the realm of possibility.",1442173369

Which is why some implementation fall back to NFA when the number of state of the DFA reaches some predefined threshold.<p>> <i>In any event the processing time of an NFA </i>implementation* can reflect this explosion*<p>Well, not necessarily.<p>Trial and error (backtracking) is not the only way to simulate an NFA.  A more reliable way to do it is to execute the multiple choices <i>in parallel</i>.  This nullifies the combinatorial explosion because the different threads share a great deal of information.<p>A thread of execution in a finite automaton has exactly 2 pieces of information: the current position in the character stream, and the current state.  In the case of a DFA, you stick to a single thread of execution, and if you fail, there&#x27;s nothing to backtrack to anyway.  In the case of an NFA, you can maintain a <i>set</i> of current states.  And that set will never be bigger than the number of states in your NFA.<p>The algorithm looks like this:<p><pre><code>  Set = [Start_state]
  Until input is empty:
     Read the next character
     New_set = []  // empty set
     For each state in your old set:
        Add all the possible next states to New_set
     Set = New_set

Just because opposing gravitational forces cancel each other out in the center (and space is flat there) does not mean time is any less distorted by all the surrounding mass.</i><p>Exactly. The relationship between mass, space, and time is complicated but there is a causal link going (roughly) in the direction of mass -> space -> time. The presence of mass warps space which dilates time (ignoring special relativity and quantum gravity which makes it weirder). The combined effects of the gravitational force (pressure) necessitates an increase in density, which further warps space, which further dilates time around the singularity.<p>Time dilation isn&#x27;t &quot;fighting&quot; the force of gravity and the warping of space, it is an observational effect that is only meaningful <i>outside</i> of the reference frame of the singularity. All other forces and phenomenon are already dependent on time so if the laws of nature do exist inside of a singularity, the existence of other effects like brownian motion will be entirely dependent on the mass/gravitational forces (aka they likely wouldn&#x27;t be relevant due to the overwhelming effect of compressing matter and energy to such a small volume).",1442171319

At the time I&#x27;d been working about a year out of university, and had not in that job come across any situation where I&#x27;d needed to know anything about how hashmaps worked under the hood (if anyone had a first job where you did, I&#x27;m happy for you, yours was a lot more interesting than mine). Any remnant of an explanation I&#x27;d got from my CS degree, most likely in first year, was way back in the mists of time. In the pressured situation, I simply admitted I didn&#x27;t know.<p>At this point the interviewer&#x27;s face soured, and he basically wrapped up the interview straight away - it had been running about 5 minutes at that point, with only one question before that, so it was pretty obviously being cut short.<p>Immediately after the interview I went to Wikipedia to look up hashmaps, instantly understood the basic mechanics, and 5 minutes later could have given a stellar answer to that question.<p>If that interviewer was looking for someone with an encyclopaedic knowledge of data structures, with flawless recall under pressure, then his question served him well in filtering me out. I sincerely doubt that&#x27;s what he was looking for, though.<p>Since that experience I&#x27;ve been very careful, doing interviews myself, never to ask straight-up knowledge questions like this - or at least if I veer into a question like that, allow the candidate to explore the idea (even tell them the answer, and just talk about it to see if they get it) if they initially don&#x27;t know. That will get you a lot closer to what you&#x27;re actually trying to assess them for.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to fall into a trap of interviewing with a &#x27;mirror&#x27; approach, where you assume that the candidate must know what you know, or else be bad. Kind of a paint by numbers, where the finished product looks a lot like you. But everyone learns on a different path. You need to remember that there was a time where each concept you use take for granted every day in your job was once new and alien to you, too. You picked it up just fine, and so can they.

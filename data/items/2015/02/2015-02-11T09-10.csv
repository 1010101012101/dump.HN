In the comments underneath more people chimed in with &quot;yeah, bloody druggies, they deserve it&quot;, and other similar sentiments. Then the original poster commented, without a hint of irony, &quot;I know, <i>who</i> would want to do drugs?! I&#x27;m bad enough after <i>10 jaegerbombs</i>, i can&#x27;t imagine what i&#x27;d be like on <i>drugs</i>&quot;. 10 jaegerbombs!! First, that is undeniably drug abuse. Second, these people don&#x27;t realise that level of alcohol is far more intoxicating and dangerous (perhaps also addictive?) than many of the hardest drugs!<p>How are people&#x27;s perspectives so off with this stuff? I understand education tells people &quot;drugs are bad mmmkay&quot; but to be as cold-hearted as to think addicts/users deserve to die, while ignoring the massive contradiction in your own beliefs? It absolutely astounds me<p>It&#x27;s drug <i>abuse</i> which poses problems at social and personal levels, not drug <i>use</i>.",1423648795

9032130,comment,9028866,9028866,0,0,KaiserPro,,,"Sorry, but using HTTP for transport is just terrible.<p>Hadoop is a poor imitation of a mainframe. When you are processing large lumps of data you need the following:<p>A task scheduler
A message passing system(although in some workloads this can be proxied by the scheduler or filesystem)
File storage<p>In mainframe land, you have a large machine with many processors all linked to the same kernel. As its one large machine, there is a scheduler that&#x27;s so good you don&#x27;t even know its there. However mainframes require specialist skills.<p>If you want shared memory cluster, you&#x27;re going to need inifiband (which is actually quite cheap now, and has 40gig ethernet type majigger in it aswell)<p>but people are scared of that, so that leaves us with your standard commodity cluster.<p>In VFX we have this nailed. before leaving the industry I was looking after a ~25k CPU cluster backed to 15pb of storage. No fancy map reduce bollocks, just plain files and scripts. Everything was connected by ten gigs ethernet. Sustained write rate of 25 gigabytes a second.<p>firstly task placement is dead simple: <a href=""https://github.com/mikrosimage/OpenRenderManagement/wiki/Introduction-to-job-submission"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mikrosimage/OpenRenderManagement/wiki/Int...</a> look how simple that task mapping is. It is legitimate to point out that there are no primitives for IPC, but then your IPC needs are varied. Most log churn apps don&#x27;t really need IPC, they just need a catcher to aggregate the results. Map:reduce has fooled people into thinking that everything is must be that way.<p>This is designed to run on bared metal. Anything else is a waste of CPU/IO. We used cgroups to limit process memory, so that we could run concurrent tasks on the same box. But everything ran the same image, anything else is just a plain arse ache.<p>The last item is file storage. HDFS is just terrible. the reason that its able to scale is that it provides literally nothing. Its just a key:value store, based on a bunch of key:value stores.<p>If you want fast super scalable posix filesystem, then use GPFS(or elastic storage). The new release has a kind of software raid that allows you to recover from a dead disk in less than an hour. (think ZFS with shards)<p>failing that you can use lustre (although that requires decent hardware raids, as its a glorified network raid0)<p>or if you are lucky you can split your file system into name spaces that reside on different NFS servers.<p>Either way, Hadoop, and hadoop inspired infrastructures are normally not the right answer. Measos is also probably not the answer unless you want a shared memory cluster. but then if you want this you need inifinband...",1423647711

When trying to find online freelancing gigs on a place like oDesk I start to quickly get huge amounts of anxiety like I have never experienced before. I do not feel like I am a bad programmer but this is something that is totally impeding me from being able to work and gain experience. Have any of you had issues similar to this? I am not sure what to do. I have a fair amount of experience in hybrid app development but it seems like most of the work is in CMS&#x27;s like WordPress so I have been exploring that a lot more in recent months.",1423646673

TCP is a protocol that is a remarkable survivor in the face of small bugs that cause packet loss (fast retransmit kicks in, for example), but the manifestation of these bugs ends up being slow throughput.<p>The current thrust of the effort in the TCP stack is to make sure that we cover all the corner cases, and build a functional testing framework to check regressions and protocol traces versus other implementations.  It&#x27;s also quite remarkable how thin on the ground test suites are for TCP...<p>Once all this is done, then I have an alpha-grade multipath TCP implementation to merge in, and defences like SYN cookies will be parameterised options that can be activated in a unikernel in response to traffic surges.",1423646471

It doesn&#x27;t really take that much to become almost completely immune to malware - 90% of it is simple to spot (don&#x27;t download things from CNET or any other site that has lots of ads, and especially those that try to trick you into clicking them; don&#x27;t open .exe&#x27;s you didn&#x27;t explicitly requested; know what&#x27;s an .exe; don&#x27;t open attachments you didn&#x27;t expect; etc.) - but somehow the society at large doesn&#x27;t bother.

What &quot;key details&quot;, if shared across the petitions, are potential causes for denial? Both offers are for similar roles, and based in the same city, but the companies themselves are completely separate. However, what concerns me here is the way the article is phrased: &quot;two or more potentially related companies&quot;, signalling that even the hint of a connection will lead to a denial with significant probability.<p>- Are there any down-sides to filing multiple H-1B petitions?<p>- Assuming I do file multiple applications, how would I explain my intent to USCIS?<p>- Any other advice / suggestions regarding my specific situation.<p>At this point, any kind of advice or help would be greatly appreciated.

I recently became aware that it is perfectly legal for different employers to each file an H-1B petition for me. Both A and B are aware of the whole situation and are willing to go ahead with the visa process, so I&#x27;ll only have to make a decision between the two if both petitions get through. So far so good.<p>However, based on an article  on murthy.com [1] (quoted below), it doesn&#x27;t seem like a very good idea to file multiple petitions, even via separate employers, this year.<p>> For the fiscal year 2015 (FY15) H1B lottery, the USCIS has been issuing notices of intent to deny (NOIDs) when virtually identical petitions have been filed for the same beneficiary by two or more potentially related companies.<p>> The USCIS is suspicious of cases in which filings for the same person share key details. Commonly identified factors typically include end-clients with the same identity, and location and job descriptions that are identical or virtually identical. The USCIS also points to similarities in supporting documents.<p>> The NOIDs request proof that the petitioning companies are not related. This can be evidenced by various documents that demonstrate corporate existence, structure, and ownership. There must be more than one distinct job opportunity, rather than simply an effort to have a backup plan in the event that one employer&#x27;s H1B petition is not selected in the lottery.<p>(continued in this comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9032082)<p>[1]: http://www.murthy.com/2014/09/25/noids-for-virtually-identical-cap-subject-h1b-petitions/",1423646038

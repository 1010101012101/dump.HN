3355463,comment,3351967,3353884,1,0,sharpneli,,,"There are 2 parts in writing good GPU code, parallelizing the algorithm and writing the kernels. Automatization of one part will not save time on other.<p>Based on practical experience the compilers are pretty good nowadays. The fine details of the kernel do not matter that much. The performance issues tend to float around usage of local memory, bank conflicts and how much one kernel instance does work, which require hand tuning and in these cases the compilers are underperforming. Thankfully the poor kernels are 'just' constant factor in the general time complexity of the algorithm.<p>On higher level the most important thing is to describe the actual algorithm. If the algorithm is described as serial one there is no automated way (and most likely will not ever be general way) of parallelizing it, except running it to check data dependencies after which you already have the result, and the dependencies can change based on inputs so result of one run cannot be generalized.<p>This could probably be proved by similar method as with halting. The program calls the autoparallelizer and if the parallelizer says there is no data dependency between 2 parts it will make them dependent, if it says there is it will make them independent.<p>Thus let it be clear:
There is no way whatsoever to take the hard parts away (thinking in parallel). Nothing will take bunch of serial code in and spit parallel programs out.",1323938879

3355453,comment,3355344,3355344,22,0,beagle3,,,"I was involved with the effort [to avoid] standardizing instant messaging back in 1999-2000. One of the products the company I was with at the time was offering was an instant messenger (with a twist that is not important for this story), so we tried to support all the prevailing protocols of the time (AIM, ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, PowWow, IRC, ... I don't even remember). And I was eagerly following the instant messaging standardisation effort at the IETF.<p>What became painfully clear to me after a while was that the big guys (AOL=AIM+ICQ, MS, YAHOO) who were running the show were all actively making sure that no standard would be decided upon. It was all dressed up in technical arguments, so it didn't look that way, but it was. Perhaps the engineers participating in the discussion weren't even aware -- it's easy to miss the big picture -- but as an outsider it was painfully obvious that the effective mandate that was given by the respective companies to their representative was to NOT standardize anything.<p>What ended up being the IETF standard was Jabber -- which was way too complicated and wasteful. And the reason it ended up that way was that while the big guys were avoiding standardisation, someone just put out an open source / open spec product which -- with all its deficiencies -- eventually worked well enough to gain non-trivial adoption, including by the IETF. And all of that happened awhile after the instant messaging working group was disbanded because of ""irreconcilable differences"" -- those differences being that every participant would only accept a standard that forced others to concede defeat and implement that participant's existing system (always in a way that limited everyone except said participant, of course)<p>Watching those discussions was an eye opener about how things supposedly work (and even look that way on the surface), and how they really work.<p>EDIT: REMOVED claim that Jabber/XMPP is still too complicated. I'm sure it still has 90% bandwidth and parsing overhead compared to comparable protocols (unless it's become backward incompatible), but standards have changed, and I guess that's no longer considered wasteful or bad engineering practice.<p>EDIT: ADDED: Just to be clear, this is an anecdote about the distant past (as in, 12 years ago now!). I have not been following Jabber/XMPP closely since 2004 and not at all since 2006 or so. Back in the day it was ill-and-under specified, ridiculously chatty (as in >90% overhead before you count TCP headers, both in bandwidth and parsing). What is acceptable has changed since then (no one cares about 95% overhead anymore), and for all I know all the kinks have been worked out.<p>And for the good parts - it is out there, there are multiple server and client implementation, and it works. That's a thousand times better than the product I was working on at the time, which was proprietary closed source, and though it was super efficient in every way, was discontinued and is no longer available.",1323938566

Google's SketchUp may be a slight exception, it's pretty easy to draw buildings in it but once you start to do more complicated things, it too gets really hard, really fast.<p>Blender's new (introduced in 2.5) UI is pretty cool. They try to have all operations available through a widget in the UI (with a tooltip), a shortcut key, a quick launch menu and through a Python scripting interface.<p>My favorite feature is the quick launch menu. Hit spacebar and a menu pops up, type in what you want and and it searches for operations using a fuzzy text search. It's also nice to see that you can adjust parameters to your operation and see your results live. Previously you had to enter all parameters beforehand and couldn't see the results, now you can e.g. draw a sphere and adjust the number of vertices in it, when you see the sphere.<p>Blender's UI has gone through a vast improvement and it's great that the UI devs have done their job well despite all the bashing they've had - I'm sure they would have done a lot more if they would have gotten more positive feedback.<p>Back when I started using Blender, when it was still a proprietary shareware software, most operations were only available through keyboard shortcuts that were mostly not documented.

3355409,comment,3355109,3355272,12,0,andrewl-hn,,,"I wouldn't dismiss Knockout right away.<p>Under the hood those data-bind attributes use the same event model as Backbone views. However unlike Backbone KO doesn't force you to write this event propagation code manually. In KO all I have to do is to declare what property of viewModel I'd like to show up without actually telling about the machinery. This helps quite a bit to reduce code bloat while still giving you all the possibilities of event model. For example one can attach more event listeners to any observable value.<p>In that 1st example tutorial the author shows bindings directly in HTML because that helps him keep sample code small and demonstrate bindings. Bindings are NOT the major feature of the framework - observables and dependency detection are. However bindings are perfect for demo as they tend to impress the newcomers quickly. They are visually appealing, too. A newcomer sees how little does it take to convert a static markup into a complete dynamic example and is more likely to continue with the tutorial and later try the framework out.<p>Also note that KO has build-in templates so no one actually forces you to put bindings inside your static (or server-side generated) html. But in general if you don't like having your markup annotated you can get away with pure-js bindings. No one actually stops you from that! The code is a bit more verbose in that case but still comparable to other frameworks.<p>However I would personally ague in favor if bind declarations inside your markup. Especially in templates that are usually belong to separated visual components or blocks. In practice even though you can put arbitrary JavaScript code inside data-bind values you always gonna have the simplest binding declarations possible: anything bigger than `visible: showItem` would seem unnatural and ugly. So you would define a `dependentObservable` for any computable values or complex conditionals instead. And that's a good thing: code should belong to JS, not HTML. But I would ague that binding declarations are about the same thing as DOM ids and classes: just a list of parameters that help rendering the DOM node correctly. It's not the code.<p>One thing that Knockout doesn't currently do that Backbone does is helping you structure your application. There are no `Models` in the framework by default although there's a plugin which does fine job. But KO doesn't make structuring you app harder either.<p>I particularly want to emphasize is that your `ViewModel` is NOT a model and it's not a kitchen sink. I see quite a lot of people who start working with Knockout put all the bindings, all the data, and all the methods into one single gargantuan object. That's not the way things should be organized! It's pretty easy to keep all your entities decoupled and separated. Knockout even has a mechanism to narrow binding context from the parent model to submodels (and access parent model if needed). So, for example, inside your user profile page one can have separate `ViewModel` objects for personal info, contact info, friends list and so on. So, modularity is not forbidden. It's still doable and Knockout doesn't make it hard.<p>I would ague that writing large structured modular applications is easier with an MVP framework. And it matters very little which framework one has chosen as long as there's one.<p>One last note: this learning tutorial is focused on current release (1.2.1). The upcoming 1.3 release is very stable and brings some nice little features that make most stuff that I talked about more prominently represented in the framework, more concise and prettier <a href=""http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2011/08/31/knockout-1-3-0-beta-available/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2011/08/31/knockout-1-3-0-be...</a><p>I'd particularly like to point you to:<p>- control-flow bindings (that let you keep most templates inlined)<p>- 'with' binding and bind context switching (helps with sub-viewmodels that I talked about)<p>- binding providers (helps you keep your HTML data-bind-free)<p>[EDIT]: formatting",1323936931

Nothing.
This is a full grown set of tools. So it's just a matter of taste.
I switched from 3DsMax to Blender. There is nothing missing. The footprint is very small and it is fast (startup time of 2 sec.). Plus developing addons in Python is very easy.

2) Third party seller network - Amazon has thousands of people that sell on its site.  This results in lower prices, more selection, and more money for Amazon when they take their cut.
3) Fulfillment - Yes Amazon has logistics but it also has Fulfillment by Amazon.  Third party sellers can send Amazon their inventory.  Amazon charges them 'rent' for this.  Plus Amazon does not have to take inventory risk on that item yet it is still available to customers 'within 24 hours'.  And to top it off Amazon still gets their cut of the sale.<p>And the one ring to bind them all:
4) Prime - a  shipping subscription to keep people looking at Amazon before anyone else.<p>Any one of these alone is a great thing to have and several companies do -<p>Ebay and Craigslist have a marketplace and third party sellers but they don't have a fulfillment network. This fundamentally limits the customer experience they can achieve.<p>Walmart has a marketplace and a fulfillment network but their third party network is in its infancy.  It will take years to work out how they merge catalogs and can deal with fraud issues and the like.<p>FedEx and UPS have fulfillment and programs to store your inventory but they lack the marketplace to sell on.  UPS customers will still end up selling on Amazon giving Amazon a cut of the sale.  Plus using Amazon's fulfillment gets your inventory available to customers faster and usually results in more sales.<p>Prime is a major competitive advantage that pretty much no one else can offer.  You aren't going to buy a subscription to Barnes & Noble or Best Buy.  I've heard of some companies trying to band together and offer a shipping subscription.  I'm doubtful that without very tight integration they can make that profitable.<p>That isn't to say no one can catch up (Walmart is probably the closet) but I think we're looking at decades of dominance.",1323936131

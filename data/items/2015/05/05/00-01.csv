9490308,comment,9485871,9485871,0,0,anifow,,,"It seems the problem is that the author is trying to create a representation of knowledge, whereas research papers are more of a logging of work done.<p>His approach may be a perfect fit for an experiment in meta-research. You could run periodic reviews of articles released in specific topical areas and create summaries of the findings. Any time those findings change, its a git commit, and you can track this change over time. It&#x27;s something like Wikipedia, but designed for research. I would not be surprised if this already exists.<p>I see a challenge in figuring out the document structure which will be the most conducive to distributed version control (pull requests, etc), and can provide some insights on a historicalbasis. For example, you could run these summaries retrospectively, say looking at DNA research in the 1960s, and do a separate commit for every key finding through the years. It seems to me that you would pretty much have to specify a specialized coding language for scientific knowledge for this structure to work.",1430787532

While chemically very similar to 99Tc, it emits gamma rays that make it a useful medical radiotracer.<p>That is, atoms differ not only because of the &#x27;different combinations of subatomic particles&#x27;, but also because of the specific energy states involved.<p>FWIW, there are the exotic atoms, like positronium (an electron-positron atom) and muonic atoms (where one of the electrons is replaced by a muon). These are still different combinations of subatomic particles.<p>Also, &quot;smallest things we have managed to measure&quot; becomes a meaningless phrase. Under current physics, an electron has no radius. It&#x27;s a point particle, and no one is talking about strings which are smaller than a point. Instead, string theory proposes that the zero-dimensional point should be replaced by a one-dimensional string, or higher-dimensional branes. These should count as being <i>larger</i> objects than the current model for how electrons work.<p>We have oodles and boodles of frontiers to our scientific knowledge. No class can touch on every case. We have to give approximations and limited cases, as otherwise the result will be overwhelming.<p>For example, in geography class we ask students to identify the US on a map. We usually mean the 48 continental states plus Hawaii and Alaska. But the US also includes Puerto Rico, Guam, and other territories, including Kingman Reef and Bajo Nuevo Bank. Teachers have to figure out if it&#x27;s more important for students to know that only the US considers Bajo Nuevo Bank to be part of the US[1], or if the students should instead learn more details about DNA, or string theory.<p>([1] While it could be an interesting segue into the International Court of Justice, Guano Act, the War of the Pacific, phosphate strip mining of Nauru, the Haber-Bosch process, and gas warfare in WWI, these are students who can&#x27;t yet identify the lower 48 on the world map!)",1430786596

What the author is missing is that the article-reference system is actually <i>more flexible</i> than a tree of dependencies. Consider the obvious example: citing Wikipedia. It&#x27;s a pain, because Wikipedia changes, so you have to link to a certain revision and if you want to know the author you have to trawl the contributions, which nobody does. And this is true of Wikipedia because Wikipedia is a work in progress: it&#x27;s not meant to be a <i>presentation</i> of knowledge but a <i>repository</i> of knowledge.<p>Science works like that too, but on the blackboards and notebooks and today blogs and comments of the investigators, which lack real start and end dates and are regularly crossed out or replaced. The work is refined for publication because publications are essentially learning materials, they&#x27;re written and edited to be as comprehensible as possible for any active researcher in the field to read for education or leisure; likewise in order for citations to be useful the cited works must include some background information which goes a long way in keeping the sciences connected, because it&#x27;s not rare for analogous problems to pop up in unrelated fields, and it is crucial that researchers from outside each others&#x27; fields can read each others&#x27; work in order for interdisciplinary collaboration of this form to be possible. But all of this background information is just background noise to the people actively working on a problem and that&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t on the blackboard or in the blog post, and it&#x27;s why terse notations like dummy indices became popular in scratch work.

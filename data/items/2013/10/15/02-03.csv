And I don&#x27;t think that it is in any way a problem.<p>Current approach of developing natural resources is an ecologist nightmare! Just consider growing fields of mono-cultured plants. And in developed/overpopulated countries, well, the land is &#x27;developed&#x27; on the country-wide scale. Ecological nightmare on a country-wide scale!<p>So.

This is not about a cherry-picked stagnant area, this is about a main highway between Russia&#x27;s two largest cities.

6551219,comment,6550068,6551064,8,0,waps,,,"Believe it or not, lawyers deal with conflicting laws all the time. There&#x27;s a few general principles, the most important &quot;rule of thumb&quot; is :<p>Constitution trumps amendments (but only in certain high-up courts), which trumps normal law, which trumps contracts (written &quot;generally&quot; before oral ones), which trumps common sense (&quot;what a good house father would do&quot;). The sum total of all these things form &quot;the law&quot; as viewed from the perspective of a person (so yes, you are legally obligated to &quot;generally be good&quot; even when the law doesn&#x27;t explicitly require it (e.g. help people involved in accidents))<p>Basically since the government debt obligations are contracts, while the debt ceiling is a law, Obama has no choice in the matter : any lawful payments (like medicare, ...) have to be fulfilled before any contract is paid. So barring a new law (the &quot;agreement&quot; the news talks about), on Okt 17, the US should default. Maybe Obama can delay it a few days, but certainly no more.<p>Please note that congress is doing exactly what it was designed to do. Congress, whether you agree with it or not, represents the will of the people of the united states and Obama is ignoring it, refusing to do so much as negotiate (or so claims congress, and I see no reason to doubt their claims). He knew years in advance that this was coming and gambled. Every executive who has fought congress on this has failed, again something Obama is perfectly aware of (it featured prominently in his education for one thing, hell, it&#x27;s one of the main forces that brought us democracy in the first place).<p>In case someone doesn&#x27;t know this : Obama&#x27;s a lawyer. Lawyers tend to be lawyers first, people second. And he has a history of this sort of thing : expect him to follow the law over common sense.",1381805757

Comcast will give you your speeds, but if they see you are seeding your debian torrents for too long, they will throttle your connection. Now they could advertise this, but we know how unpopular connection throttling is. However in a way, a connection throttle is your minimum service guarantee - your speed will never go below the throttle.<p>Now I don&#x27;t know anything about laying internet pipe, but lets say we gave everyone <i>minimum service guarantees</i>, how much do you think that would cost, and how much would you be willing to pay for a given speed? It may be completely possible that Comcast is fine with your seeding as long as you limit your speed to percentage of that number.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really refute your point, but given these two constraints its easy to see why ISPs may choose to go the &quot;up to XMbps&quot; route rather than the &quot;minimum allowed route.&quot; Would it really change anything for you if you found out that your minimum service guarantee was 768kbps at your current price point?",1381805617

The reason why this story looks so attractive is because there are so few ads, if any. Yes, this format lends itself to being able to do full-page ads or special built-in ads...but those take work to both acquire and construct. Given that these type of feature stories are far and few between, I&#x27;d be surprised if the higher-CPM on special-feature-story-ads outweighs the bespoke-effort needed to acquire and implement them. In any case, I highly doubt that if it does, that it does so at a scale that is meaningful.<p>And another thing: the reporting and editing is obviously the bottleneck here. But let&#x27;s let that be a given...the other main bottleneck is the non-web-dev reporters and editors trying to get their ideas into this innovative format. My guess is, that even at the New York Times, this is a very painful and slow process, even if your devs include Mike Bostock, creator of D3. Part of these features are done with generated templates. And part of them appear to be handcrafted.<p>But again, it&#x27;s not the hand-crafting that is necessarily the most painful part of the tech workflow. It&#x27;s the editing across systems that weren&#x27;t designed for this collaboration. Have you ever built a fancy website in Flash only to have your client want to change a bunch of links that were hard-coded? Imagine that, except across several editorial departments. Another way to think of it: newspaper reporters and editors typically do not use Sublime Text.<p>----<p>Some technical observations:<p>The NYT interactive team has been doing analytics on these different story formats.

How could the main road link between the port and the capital be in such a sorry state? The answer lies in the Russian way of doing things.

Roads serve those areas which are not important enough to have trains, so when you take a road trip in Russia, you are choosing to travel off the beaten track in the back of beyond.

I did, once upon a time, work for a news organization that was considered to be innovative with respect to using technology to further the presentation of journalism.<p>One of the things I worked on was a generic framework for &quot;composite&quot; stories -- that is, a collection of not just text and photos, but integrated presentations of text, audio/video, photos and data visualizations, with customizable templating to lay it all out and organize for the web.<p>Time and link rot have not been kind to the things that were done with that. For example, the data bits of this:<p><a href=""http://www2.ljworld.com/news/mining/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.ljworld.com/news/mining/</a><p>no longer function, and it certainly shows its age, design-wise. But that was where we were in early 2007, technology-wise, and it was built with a hacked-together-in-a-week proof of concept of the underlying framework.<p>What we had at the time shipped with some standard out-of-the-box templates for presenting a story, and for one-off stories we could also task someone to work on creating new ones which could be slotted in for use. When new templating work wasn&#x27;t required, they could put together a composite story presentation in a matter of hours, once they had all the materials they wanted.<p>The next evolution of that, which I was pushing for toward the end of my tenure there but never got to complete, would have been integrated data processing and visualization tools, allowing journalists to toss various sources (my rough draft worked with spreadsheets, since those were a pretty common source) into a denormalized data store, scrub a bit, and generate useful presentations from them.<p>While I can&#x27;t be sure, I strongly suspect that the NYT has done something similar, developing the underlying framework for tying together a bunch of content in an attractive way, and probably building some tools to simplify and speed up the generation of the data presentations. What they&#x27;re doing here, and have done a couple other times, seems well within reach for someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing and has access to six years&#x27; worth of advances in technology.<p>(anecdotally, I&#x27;ve heard that the NYT special projects are done in Rails; ours were done in Django since it was originally our in-house web framework, but in either case it&#x27;s a strong argument for the productivity gains of those web frameworks)<p>Edit: FWIW, here are slides from a lightning talk I gave at PyCon in 2008, about a data-driven project and the timeline involved in it:<p><a href=""http://media.b-list.org/presentations/2008/pycon/lightning.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.b-list.org/presentations/2008/pycon/lightning.p...</a><p>Sadly, the story itself is no longer functioning.<p>Here&#x27;s one that&#x27;s actually miraculously still online, from the fall/winter a few years back when everyone was worried about swine flu:<p><a href=""http://www2.ljworld.com/data/flu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.ljworld.com/data/flu/</a><p>The core of that was put together very quickly, and then it was about an hour&#x27;s work each week to update with the latest data coming in.",1381803219

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a particularly good analogy, but it&#x27;s the best I can come up with as an illustration of his &quot;system-oriented&quot; approach.<p>In a goal-oriented system, someone might choose to lose 30 pounds as their goal, then they&#x27;ll work toward that goal through exercise or diet. Upon achieving it, they&#x27;ll either continue (setting another goal) or fall off the wagon (going back to previous habits and gaining the weight right back). I&#x27;ve known enough people who have tried to diet repeatedly--and have succeeded in their weight loss--only to fail miserably and gain the weight back within a few weeks.<p>In a system-oriented approach (or maybe you could call it a habit-oriented system?), you focus on building up or improving your habits so that they meet whatever goals you set. Using the example of losing weight, you&#x27;d focus on diet and exercise by making fundamental lifestyle changes to your behavior and eating habits that simply happens to produce weight loss as a byproduct. People who exploit this system by changing their habits consistently keep the weight off because their day to day behavior has fundamentally changed. To put it another way, their habits would have to be dramatically altered in order to go back to putting on the weight they lost as a consequence of this approach.<p>Now, what I&#x27;m at a loss on is how this might apply to businesses, software development, or the likes other than to suggest it&#x27;s a matter of developing good habits. To use his restaurant example: Instead of focusing on income goals, focus on making the best food in town and serving customers quickly. On second thought, maybe there isn&#x27;t anything more to it other than habits? Maybe there&#x27;s no &quot;secret?&quot; Develop good habits and plod along until something falls into your lap as a byproduct.",1381802999

Your attempt to psychologise the guy is just a cheap tactic to avoid this point.<p>>Asking that people act nicer does not make something a &quot;politically correct thought police &#x27;safe space&#x27;&quot;.<p>The hidden (and incorrect) assumption here is that this is unconnected to PC activism.<p>>And claiming that asking that people act nicer is &quot;co-opting of male spaces&quot; is a pretty pathetic attempt to play the victim card while simultaneously trying to exclude and marginalize women who have contributed tons to the tech industry.<p>&quot;Pathetic&quot;, &quot;margenalize&quot;, &quot;afraid&quot;, &quot;exclude&quot;, etc. And you say this is unconnected to PC activism? His post didn&#x27;t marginalize anyone. It was making a fairly specific point that your defense mechanisms are preventing you from seeing.",1381802468

6551014,comment,6549502,6549707,6,0,drewcrawford,,,"Your post is based on a lot of actual and epistemological assumptions that are either incorrect, or undefended.  For example:<p>> This is done because most home users could never afford internet, if they had to pay for full price.<p>There is an epistemological problem here about what &quot;full price&quot; means, which is subjective.  I would argue that &quot;full price&quot; is simply &quot;whatever AT&T/Comcast charges you&quot;.  You seem to want there to be some &quot;other&quot; type of price that is the &quot;real price&quot;.<p>Perhaps you are saying that ISPs make more money from business customers than from residential customers.  Perhaps this is true, but the fact that it is convenient for the business model of an ISP to charge some customers more does not mean that other customers are not paying &quot;full price&quot;.<p>Perhaps you are saying that residential customers are being provided connections that are below cost.  But in an efficient market, an ISP could of course decide not to serve residential customers.  Seeing as how ISPs continue to serve residential customers, it must be because residential customers are in fact paying enough money to cover the costs of the services they receive (e.g. &quot;full price&quot;).<p>> The reason it&#x27;s cheaper is because you agree to use it very lightly<p>You seem to be suggesting that the primary factor in network costs is <i>use</i>, but all the sources I read (for example this one)[1] suggest that connecting the last mile is expensive, and routing an arbitrary volume of packets over that pre-installed copper is extremely cheap.<p>If this is true, then it is the residential market that is subsidizing the high-margin business connections, because the sprawling (profitable, predictable) residential networks are the ones that are shortening the last-mile distance to (sparser) business links.<p>> What some people try to do, is &#x27;cheat&#x27; that system.<p>There is an epistemological assumption in here that &quot;the system&quot; is fair or impartial or acknowledged in general by society or based on objective costs, or something.<p>> Home users never pay for most of the speeds they get.<p>I&#x27;ve covered this earlier, but just as an additional argument, I did a cost comparison, and consumer vs business class in my area for my ISP is merely double.  Those packages all include website hosting, Exchange, Sharepoint, static IPs, 24x7 support, etc.  Just as a point of comparison, market rates for 2GB of Sharepoint hosting are $25/month, hosted Exchange is $20/month, 24x7 support is who knows, etc... So fair to say, very little of the additional revenue could possibly be going to network costs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.muninetworks.org/content/solving-middle-mile-availability-does-not-solve-last-mile-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.muninetworks.org/content/solving-middle-mile-avai...</a>",1381802460

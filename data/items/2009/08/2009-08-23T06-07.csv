The CEO is a 44 year-old man child suffering a mid-life crisis and his wife got pregnant again because she was afraid he would divorce her for someone younger like his friends have done. Secretly he fears his wife will discover the reason he hired the marketing girl was because she reminded him of a younger version of her. And my 31 year-old coworker is a bigger geek than I ever could imagine and absolutely clueless all this and more is going on around him.</i><p>Did you actually secretly go through their computers and dig up all this very private information about them?

And, companies like Apple spend a <i>lot</i> of money on usability and design.  So, don't feel bad that it's hard.<p>I'd suggest letting Mechanical Turkers find usability problems for you.  When I launched my social news site (now defunct), I asked Turkers to use my site, and post a comment if anything was confusing or could be streamlined.  They gave me a lot of great feedback for $0.10 a piece.   Turkers are surprisingly well educated and tech savvy.  I use the service every time I can.",1251010427

What and where is the best way to establish such relationships?  I know about sites like getafreelancer, etc...but those seem to be one-time deals, with a bidding process, rather than a trusted, on-going working relationship with someone.<p>2.) Besides a portfolio of past work, what ways would you recommend to find out if a person interested in working with me really has what it takes to do the types of jobs, with the speed necessary?<p>3.) How do you deal with NDA issues, such as server passwords of my own clients, etc, that may be required to be passed on to do some of the work if there were to be some delegation?<p>4.) Would it be okay & decent to post my email address so that HN hackers/readers who are in related fields and are interested in such relationships to reply to me?",1251009221

There are a lot of venture capitalists and not too many good companies. If your company is attractive, you can probably find a firm that will agree to put $10 million into the company and, say, $3 million into your pocket.

In the end, you'd have to cut the cable or lose the device altogether to lose them. This is only a win-win for people who really love their iPod headphones and have never destroyed one somehow.<p>I think that idea is less appealing if not outright repulsive to the people who don't want to use the iPod headphones <i>ever</i> (like me, with my half dozen unopened sets of Apple headphones in a box somewhere). Apple has no incentive to do this either - I'm sure they make a tidy profit from selling replacement iPod headphones and 3rd party headphones in their stores.",1251008997

If in a hypothetical case there had been three developers, and a company hired all three of them without buying the company, things would have looked suspicious to more than a few people.

780287,comment,773447,773670,0,0,lacker,,,"One problem I often run into is that the Django libraries expect the whole application to be run by something that uses manage.py, which sets particular os.environ settings. So if you make code dependent on a Django library, often it cannot be run any more by non Django code. The eventual result is that things like cron jobs and unit testing are second-class citizens.<p>Another problem is unicode. Current Django assumes you will deal with all strings as valid unicode, which is actually different from pre-1.0 Django. There is no way to store an arbitrary sequence of bytes without a unicode encoding. This makes perfect sense for a newspaper website, but is problematic for many other applications.<p>Another problem is imports in general. Django does a lot of work in __init__.py files which causes problems integrating it with other systems that do a lot of things at run time.",1251008514

Instead, it seems to me that random seeks are really the only performance problem nowadays. In the most extreme case throughput is only ~100Bits/s instead of ~100MB/s. Unfortunately random seeks are hidden behind abstraction layers and thus quite invisible to programmers (until the system freezes). Maybe we just need to wait for SSDs to become cheap.",1251008422

Profits were made, yes, sometimes significant ones, but nothing quite proportional to the influence of the technology. The bulk of the benefits came to the organizations that leveraged this technology for their own ends like modern states, which would have been logistically impossible without the printing press, or the myriad business that cannot be conceived without a superbly well-educated (for pre-modern standards) source of workers and consumers.<p>The same pattern can be seen in many other technical advances, specially those that impacted society the most.

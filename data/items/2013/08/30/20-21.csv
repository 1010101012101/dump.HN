Though I had been making games for a while with various tools (e.g. TGF), it was nice to finally close the loop and write in a programming language, even if it was only BASIC. That pushed me to take a programming course in high school the following year. I was writing pong and asteroid clones and ray casting engines in class.<p>The author&#x27;s points about the iPad seem pretty accurate. I can&#x27;t even imagine how I would go from having an iPad as a high school student to stumbling into programming.<p>I haven&#x27;t developed in iOS, but I did play around with Android and the thing that really frustrated me was that the sample games were several files and ~1,000 LOC. We&#x27;re talking <i>really</i> simple games and the amount of boilerplate crap was mind boggling. To even get to that point, of course, you have to screw around with an IDE, plugins, an emulator, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a far cry from <i>PRINT &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;</i>",1377896277

What might not happen is, in a very resource strained condition, is for the remote application to get the data. There&#x27;s no relation between you doing a connect() and the remote doing an accept() in TCP, it&#x27;s handled asynchronously by the kernel. (Traditionally the backlog argument to listen() controlled this behavior, but that backlog argument is by and large ignored on modern operating systems)<p>The caveat here is that you close() the socket when you&#x27;re done. close() does not, by default, wait until the remote end also closed its end. In the scenario described above, the remote end would eventually signal an error, but if you shoved the data into the remote kernel buffers, close and forget about that connection, your app will never see that error.",1377896112

The calculator does it numerically so we were forced to recognize which types of problems could be solved exactly and which could not. Intersections of curves can also easily be solved with a graphing calculator.<p>Other things like systems of linear equations, probability distributions, statistics, combinatorics, and rapid data entry and processing can also be done really easily on a graphing calculator. These are all tedious to do by hand, and all make an appearance in upper level high-school math classes.<p>Part of taking a math class should be learning tools to solve your problems efficiently, and exact solutions are often not the most efficient way to do that. Things like Excel, Python, and Maple are all nice but they assume access to a computer and would require significant disruption to lecture flow.

Whether how much <i>farther</i> this is from other &quot;hot&quot; years than they are from each other is a key point is at least debatable.<p>For any purpose for which a zero is needed (which doesn&#x27;t include showing magnitude of change), for temperature 0 degrees F (which presumably this is -- a real problem with this is that it just specifies degrees, which is ambiguous) is just as arbitrary and inappropriate as 53 degrees F; if you are doing a visualization for which it is important to show a meaningful zero, you&#x27;d actually want <i>absolute</i> zero (0K). But for most things related to climate change, there&#x27;s no reason for &quot;zero&quot; as the baseline.<p>There&#x27;s certainly purposes for which a meaningful baseline other than 0K or 53F would be appropriate -- what that baseline would be depends on the purpose.",1377895589

Stuff was either &quot;Never done this before&quot; or &quot;Done a version of this countless times before&quot; -  and either way, in the past, I&#x27;ve gotten caught up in trying to be perfect, and then not getting anything done.  \nThe hour limit took perfection out of the equation for old and new tasks.  So, for example, who knows what is the perfect regex for grabbing websites and their associated comment pages from HN?  Not me!  But I whipped one up, and v1.0 was enough to make a graphical version of the front page of HN.  Spin up a Linux Azure VM?  No experience with it - but I could probably spend a day reading about other people doing it.  Or, I could give myself an hour (or maybe more if Azure takes longer than an hour to create a vm(!) ) and then see what I have after that.  \nI think the most valuable tool I used was my brain :^)  By that I mean if you are great at coding in a particular language, and you are trying to &quot;get stuff done&quot; then use that language to help you learn the new stuff.  For me, shell scripts work perfectly to glue multiple languages and utilities together for projects like this.  \nThe last part I&#x27;ll mention is that I tried my best to keep the solution simple.  So there&#x27;s no elaborate backend here, no super-cool caching of anything, nada.  Yes, I can do all of that stuff if I have to, but I can also spend days  or weeks perfecting (messing around with) all of that and still have little more than what is here.  Sixty minutes is plenty of time to get something done if it&#x27;s new or old hat.  That was a pleasant discovery.

Forcing students to expend effort on keeping track of many-digit numbers is in general an unnecessary mental load which distracts from the concepts being taught. Including &quot;how to use your calculator&quot; sections as part of mathematics instruction, and assigning &quot;calculator problems&quot; which include e.g. unreasonably complex symbolic integration problems or unreasonably precise numbers, for the sake of giving students practice with a graphing calculator interface is a waste of teacher and student effort.<p>Additionally, Because Texas Instruments has so effectively lobbied textbook authors and test writers and school administrations to get their calculators on the list of approved/official devices, many students are prompted to spend an unreasonable amount of money on calculators which they do not need. Its something like a tax on those students.<p>TI graphing calculators have awful, obtuse interfaces. Their programming and debugging tools are rudimentary and outdated. Their graphics capabilities are limited, and graphics made with them cant be used for any other purpose or easily shared. Students would be much better served by lessons/mentoring on the use of regular general-purpose computers and programming languages, whether for mathematics or whatever else. If they need symbolic integration or graphing capabilities for solving some concrete engineering problem, or for exploring, they would be much better served by a tool such as Mathematica or Maple [or heck, Python] than by a TI calculator. Full computers are much better for inputting and interacting with data and mathematical structures.<p>It&#x27;s been 9 years since I was in high school. But on principle, I never bought a graphing calculator, and I never found it to be any disadvantage in any course I encountered in high school or college [except, briefly, on the AP Calculus test, where I had to familiarize myself with the TI83&#x27;s awful UI on a borrowed calculator during the test; it didnt end up hurting my score].

When the &#x27;l&#x27; sound ends, my tongue leaves the roof of my mouth, but it never &quot;strikes the bottom&quot; of my mouth.  If there&#x27;s a vowel next, it moves to a neutral position for a vowel.  If the &#x27;l&#x27; was the end of the speech, it just kind of sits in place for a second after the noise stops.  If it&#x27;s followed by another consonant, it moves for that articulation (e.g. when saying &quot;all the sounds&quot;, it moves directly from the alveolar ridge to the teeth for the dental fricative).<p>When pronouncing an &#x27;r&#x27; (alveolar approximant), I, and I think most English speakers, roll the tongue backwards to some degree (although not enough that the point of articulation is the bottom of the tongue).  I.e. the tongue does not &quot;stay at the bottom&quot;.  Yes, it is certainly possible to pronounce an English &#x27;r&#x27; with the tip of your tongue held down (unlike &#x27;l&#x27;), but I think most English speakers would find this &quot;impossible&quot; at first, and then with a minute of practice would realize that it was possible but difficult.

That is not in any way a reflection of their intelligence or work ethic in the least. They are smart, and they&#x27;ve proven that with numerous tests and years of training. But when effective communication is hindered, there is damage to confidence, mutual understanding, and progress. Confusion amongst doctors and nurses hurt patient management. Families who don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re being told feel less confident in the physician caring for their loved one because no clear direction or assessment is articulated.<p>And PG here is saying <i>no</i> different. Communication is just as essential in running a startup as it is in managing a patient. Your investors rely on your communication abilities to accurately assess the state of your company. Cofounders need to understand you for decisions to be made. Employees need to feel confident in their leader and the direction they&#x27;re moving in.<p>This isn&#x27;t xenophobic <i>at all</i>. Foreign accents, here in America, probably make up the majority of communication issues. I&#x27;m sure PG would&#x27;ve mentioned stammering and stuttering if it were significant in his data, but it likely wasn&#x27;t.

6303885,comment,6303410,6303410,1,0,pjungwir,,,"I freelance, and most of these are not really pain points. About half my clients pay on Net 30 terms, so 7-10 days after the invoice is fine with me. Getting a check doesn&#x27;t bother me either. It&#x27;s an excuse to get out of the house and walk to the bank, so I actually I sort of prefer it over ACH. Re taxes: it&#x27;s not that hard to be informed and do it yourself, but in the last year I&#x27;ve switched to an accountant and that&#x27;s pretty nice too. I think he&#x27;s saving me more than I&#x27;m paying him, even before considering the hours and hours (and mental energy) freed up from doing taxes myself. Re your last point: sure, who wouldn&#x27;t want the sales process to be easier? But I&#x27;m pretty swamped with work as-is.<p>Here are the pain points I think about:<p>- How do I take a vacation? At any time I&#x27;ve got one (or two!) 20-hour/week projects, plus 2-3 extended relationships that require 5-20 hours/month. It&#x27;s hard to spin them all down at once for 1-2 weeks. Seems like a partner would help, or even a relationship with another freelancer I could trust to be on call for emergencies while I&#x27;m away.<p>- Where do I go from here? I&#x27;m not sure how much further I can raise my rate for general-purpose web development. I could start doing patio11-style business value contracts instead, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m ready for that yet. I&#x27;d rather either (1) specialize in Postgres, Chef, Machine Learning, or whatever and double my rate that way, or (2) transition to an &quot;agency&quot; by seeking larger projects and partnering or subcontracting to get them done, or (3) get better at recurring revenue like support contracts.<p>I think ndcrandall has a nice idea. I could imagine a marketplace around helping freelancers trade clients, or even just help each other with overflow work.",1377892909

At best, pg badly miscommunicated what he was trying to say. He could have just said something like &#x27;founders who cannot communicate well&#x27; or &#x27;founders who can&#x27;t be understood&#x27; etc. - but he chose specifically to refer to &quot;strong foreign accents&quot;.<p>Arguably, some Americans might find it easier to understand some foreign accents (strong British accents, some Indian accents etc) than some American accents (e.g. some rural southern accents). More to the point, some folks with foreign accents can speak much better English and articulate their ideas (and make themselves understood) much better than many people speaking in a mainstream American accent. However, pg chose to use the &quot;strong foreign accent&quot; criterion instead of the more correct &quot;communicate well&quot; criterion.<p>2. imo a stubborn refusal to acknowledge mistakes/errors is a big weakness and pg is demonstrating that weakness with passive-aggressive pushbacks like the one on Twitter &quot;Don&#x27;t say things people want to misunderstand.&quot;<p>Sorry, I think pg&#x27;s statement was either blatantly wrong or badly expressed/communicated, but that doesn&#x27;t amount to me being a part of the alleged &quot;looking-for-reasons-to-be-offended patrol&quot; that one of the commenters below talks about. pg (and his defenders on hn) will be better served by trying to understand the criticism instead of making up false motives for the critics of his statement.<p><i><edit> Ten minutes after I posted the comment, it was at 3 points. Thirty minutes later, it was at ZERO points, one hour later at -1 :) In addition to showing the net-points for each comment, I wish HN also showed the total number of upvotes and downvotes each comment receives.</i>",1377892874

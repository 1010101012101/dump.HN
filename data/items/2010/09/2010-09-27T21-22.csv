I do not use Facebook, and I do not wish to use Facebook, and I do not believe that I should be treated as an Unperson because of this choice. If a site wants to make certain its users/members are using their ""real identity"", better solutions can be found than tying themselves to Facebook! I am a hobbyist software developer and I prefer to host my own contact and information pages. This is an issue I feel very emotional about - requiring a Facebook account for the use of an unrelated service feels to me like a personal insult.

1733638,comment,1723305,1732053,0,0,sesqu,,,"I don't have that book, so you'll have to explain the reasoning if you want to convince me. I did find the MIT OCW lecture transcript on randomized quicksort, based on the book, and it described how randomization probably defeats an adversary supplying a worst-case initial permutation when the pivoting algorithm is known. That's a different adversary to the one we are discussing, even if relaxed; it has to supply an input that is consistent <i>and</i> fixed. They also motivated the scenario in terms of competition, which I find less reasonable than actual malevolence, but that bears little relevance now.<p>When theory and practise diverge, there is strong reason to hold the practise as more defensible than the theory. How would you say the practice should be amended to not suffer from this problem that is apparently not extant in theory? I hold that it cannot, for this adversary is more capable than the other.",1285624699

But it was not in the interest of Facebook or Twitter to agree to it.  Therefore no meeting of the minds was possible.<p>I also believe that collusion was made much easier by the existing good relationships you refer to.<p>Where we may part ways is on what the execs were saying to themselves.  I don't think it was just about maintaining good relations.  I believe it was about reducing the cost of having to replace key institutional knowledge.  It is worth skipping out on raw talent (that will need training) if it results in keeping key people.<p>Which brings us back to my point.  Microsoft, Oracle and Yahoo do not have good reputations among tech people.  So they are not major threats to losing institutional knowledge.  And they are a great source of candidates.  So it isn't in the interests of Apple, Google, etc to extend the agreement to those companies.<p>Kind of the same problem that kept it from happening with Facebook, but with the roles reversed.",1285624581

It's like the cheap knock-offs of brand names - the chinese Konferse shoes might look like Converse, they might be cheaper and they might even be better but nobody will buy them because they aren't the original Converse.<p>If you want to own a niche you have to innovate your way there.

</code></pre>
I find it fascinating that as soon as you tried to counter an argument about signaling social standing, you directly signaled social standing.  Truly, we do not always know the real motivations behind our own actions and words.  You may need to do more introspection.<p>""I'm a regular guy"" -- This establishes a social status you want us to see.  You are trying to create a peer relationship with other ""regular"" people, to connect with your audience on a friend/peer/informal level.  Then you follow up this statement with an assertion that you wish to speak for others (""I'm interested in 'the truth' ... where 'us' includes everyone I care about"").  You have elevated yourself to leader/spokesperson status.  You make another social distinction when you say ""individuals like me"", and here you are trying to tell everyone -- in so many words -- that you are unique and special.  Whether you realized you were doing this, you employed arguments from standpoints of status.<p>I cannot find the article, but I read an account from a guy who took a few-month vow of silence for fun to see what it was like.  He had a number of interesting mental state changes and experiences, all of which seemed beneficial, but one thing that stuck out in my mind was a little principle of communication that he felt he discovered: Almost all our speech is to express existence, to say, ""Hey, look at me!  I am here!""<p>In forums where people pass ideas back and forth, it is often, ""I exist!  I have something to share that you will find useful!  You might like me if I share it!  Look at me!""<p>And yes, the fact that I am responding is, indeed, to draw attention to myself, to establish myself as something of an authority on this issue, given my limited experiences in this lifetime... is just a pompous way of saying, ""I am here"". :)",1285621399

Most of the design decisions serve to frustrate me more than empower me. The variable context I'm working in always seems always a bit mystical.

Sometimes I don't mind this -- writing Haskell has never felt anything like writing Python. In fact, writing Haskell almost feels like writing a proof (and for good reason, look into the type system theoretics if you're interested) instead of a program. Therefore when writing Haskell I never feel like I need to make a comparison to languages like Python. They work differently and will be used by for different things.<p>Javascript, on the other hand, feels bland and conventional and begs for me to compare it to languages like Python. When I do I realize that the modularity, import system, and library of functions I've written in Python have disappeared into the wind, along with the ability to jump to C when necessary for performance.<p>In fact, when it comes to performance, Javascript is the worst! Not that Javascript performance itself is terrible as a scripting language, but that There Is More Than One Way To Do It but Only One Way Is Fast. The JQuery author is an expert at this, as well as some of my good friends at Google. There's always been a Book of Javascript, passed from developer to developer, that says what the Fast Way is. I hate that. I don't want to have to memorize idioms if I want my code to be performant. In summary, I guess, I want Python ;)<p></rant>",1285621220

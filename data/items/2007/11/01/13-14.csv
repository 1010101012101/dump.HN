I want a shopping basket for buying pets\n2) You could be way more aggresive with my minifeed. Saying Sumon has bought Irra K as a pet in my minifeed would be awesome for virality\n3) Where is the box within my profile? It would be cool to see what pets i owned in my profile widget. Then have a link saying buy them back and make cash! That would get people adding this app.<p>Its a good start - and having a celebdaq equivalent for facebook would be awesome. Study fluff friends for some more inspiration. ",1193922133

I think there's a way to deal with it. <p>If Active is what everyone's using, create an interface for your service as well as the Active service, give people a simple interface to Active as a way to introduce them to your service. Build on top of Active so to speak. What you really should try is to build on top of ALL other services and make a better interface to them. That's not an easy task but it might be required to win the market.\nThis idea is taken from Joel Spolsky's essay ""Chicken and Egg Problems""<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000054.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000054.html</a><p>You should definitely try it, the idea is good and the market is there and you seem excited so go.",1193922029

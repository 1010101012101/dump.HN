It sounds impossible but I'm starting to think it's possible. It goes like this:<p>Is it possible to synchronize or to measure the time difference between two atomic clocks that are far away from each other via the internet?<p>Take into account, of course, that we're talking nanoseconds of time in the atomic clock, and around 100 milliseconds in Internet latency.<p>Can you describe a way to do it, or explain why it cannot be done?",1241827179

I mean, the database application layer typically promises to be atomic, sure.  But at any given point in time are the bits on disk truly atomic?  Does a database not sometimes take 2+ writes to fully change data?  And does an iSCSI backup really copy the entire disk at a single point in time?  I thought that was magic specific to something like ZFS.  Because if it doesn't, couldn't you have a database backup that isn't really usable?<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that application level DB dumps exist for a reason - and I'm no expert so I'd love someone to explain how full disk backups work re: databases.",1241826493

600482,comment,600437,600437,0,0,dfranke,,,"PGP is not in especially much danger due to the new results against SHA-1.  The new attack is a birthday attack, not a preimage attack.  PGP uses SHA-1 in several places, including some where it's ""hard-wired"" (i.e., parties can't specify any alternative hash algorithm), but there's only one where a birthday attack does any good: signing others' keys; this attack would work basically the same way as the one that produced the rogue SSL CA using an MD5 collision.  Even here, this further requires a chosen-suffix attack, which this new advance is not; though I would not be surprised if one were discovered in the near future.  Every other use of hash functions in PGP depends only on their one-wayness, not on collision-resistance.<p>Nonetheless, in light of the new results, the IETF Working Group on OpenPGP is likely to reconvene to produce a new version of the standard that doesn't depend on SHA-1.  They're also currently discussing my suggestion to include a random salt at the beginning of the data that gets hashed for key signatures, effectively rendering the integrity of these signatures immune to birthday attacks.  If this is done, and it likely will be, then PGP could probably get away even with using MD5 everywhere (not that I'm recommending this!).<p>If, in the interim, a chosen-suffix attack against SHA-1 is discovered, then signers can protect themselves by migrating their keys away from it as dkg advises.  Also, <i>only newly-made key signatures would be vulnerable.  Key signatures made prior to the discovery of such an attack would not be compromised</i>.",1241826366

The lady from IT dept was very nice and willing to work with me to find a resolution. For now, we agreed to increase the interval to 15 minutes. Still they could not unblock because they were still having issues with the load and people higher up won't approve.<p>Having been a student here for a few years, what happens is towards the end and beginning of each semester, our course registration system starts crawling. This is because too many folks are checking grades and signing up for classes. It lasts 3-4 days. This is what seems to have happened this week as our school year came to an end.

By gutting the ability of local governments to fund themselves it pushed all of the taxation up to the state level (and the state turns around and hands most of the money back to the local jurisdictions.)  Since the primary revenue generators at the statewide level are income and sales taxes this introduces volatility that is directly tied to the general economic condition, unfortunately the new burdens placed on the state budget as a result of Prop 13 are mostly independent of the general economic condition.  This lethal combination leads to a never-ending cycle of boom and bust in the state budget.",1241825304

To convince me you should not concentrate on examples of cases where less copyright would be better - you and me both agree they exist. What I want to hear is how a world with no copyright would be better in the areas where copyright is considered especially useful right now. Like the map example, or the pharmaceutical company. That would convince me it can be better overall.<p>As far as the arbitrary length of the copyright being wrong, I fully agree. But I do not think throwing the baby with the bathwater is a solution. If a way would be found for the market to dictate it that would really be great... but in a way it does. There is commercial lobbies that push it up, and voters who push it down. We definitely need more pushing down lately.<p>About programming... I make my living writing software (freelance). All my clients ""rent"" my software, and I constantly work on it and update it according to how their business change (and it changes surprisingly often). The model works for both of us because:<p>1) They do not pay upfront for a big software, which may or may not turn out to be useful. They get much better value for their money, and make me directly motivated to keep the software always useful.<p>2) I do work more in the beginning, for practically no pay, but for each project I get a new source of income, and overall I make more money (over several years) then if I'd just write a software and leave. Also I like working with people I know.<p>Now, how does this depend on copyright? If, by any chance, the source code of the software would be leaked, the fact that I own the copyright would still force my clients to keep working with me. In a no-copyright world, anybody could take the software, add a few (useful) features and get the contract instead of me. Now I know what you will say. This is better for everybody, right? It's better for the client, because there is more competition, it's better for the guy who could take over because he will get business by doing something good, and it's better for me because it will force me to keep improving my software, right?<p>No. In such a world, I would simply not start the whole thing. EVER. It wouldn't pay. The whole thing depends on me working my ass of in the beginning, and then getting the reward in time. Without copyright, neither me not any other freelancer would start doing the work only to lose the contract in 6 month. Income security is a very direct factor in my decision to do it.<p>And this is not a big evil greedy corporation. This is me working for clients who usually become friends, or at least partners. I worry for their business, because I have a stake in it. And they know it, and value it. And this wouldn't be possible without IP.",1241825187

It doesn't offer me a single reason to choose it over another browser if I even identify it as a browser in the first place.<p>And Google already has the best possibly place they could advertise Chrome - Google.com.  People visiting Google.com, presumably, already like/trust/think highly of Google.  Right there, you're only marketing to people who are more likely to be in favor of your company.  Beyond that, they can offer lots of information and a download right there - getting much better results than a TV ad.<p>With the TV ad, I'm left with little other than a message to ""Install Google Chrome"" whatever that is.  With a link on a website, I can get more information, see why Chrome is better, and install it right there.

If you are making money despite them i'd imagine you'd be less sanguine, but if you're making money even from the pirates wouldn't it be in your long term interest to switch to free distribution to grow your user base much, much faster? Obviously the timing is an issue particularly if it'd leave you without much cushion, but shouldn't it be part of your strategy, because otherwise someone else will get there first in that niche and have the fast growth that could otherwise be yours (not necessarily sustainable but fast)",1241823862

take a look at one of my most recent projects :) <a href=""https://github.com/lhecker/se2-bga"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lhecker/se2-bga</a><p>I&#x27;m currently studying computer science in germany. In a team of 5 we created the above project for a software engineering assignment. But in the end I wrote the entire code part alone. :D<p>It implements a simulated elevator and displays the internal state in a UML state machine diagram.<p>It features:<p><pre><code>  - Grunt build system
  - JSX + ES6 to ES5 transpiler using babelify and browserify
  - LESS to CSS transpiler
  - karma + jasmine test system
  - live reloading (&quot;grunt serve&quot;)
  - building a static page from the source code (&quot;grunt dist&quot;)
  - building a nw.js based app from the static page (&quot;grunt build&quot;)</code></pre>",1436360390

9851206,comment,9851138,9851138,0,0,sharetea,,,"The similarity between China now and Japan 1990 is very noticeable.  That is, they&#x27;re both exporting country that has an aging demographic which likes to save, has a small consumer base compared to export, and is losing export shares as production moves out of country to other cheaper countries. And they both choose to save the banking system instead of letting it self correct.  This means that China will likely see 10-20 years of deflationary decline just like Japan.  However, because China suffers from massive capital outflow from rich leaving the country, and it already has reached very high debt to GDP ratio (something Japan reached only years later after 1990), I would say China is in even worse shape than Japan in 1990.",1436360239

The key finding in the article is &quot;We conclude that the currently available number of independent phenetic markers is too small, and within-population craniometric variation too large, to permit reliable reconstruction of the biological population affinities of Kennewick Man.&quot; In other words, we don&#x27;t have a good enough data set about skull measurement variation in human populations to assign the Kennewick skull reliably to any population that has been sampled.<p>The genetic findings are consistent with those of other studies, for example the landmark review article &quot;Toward a new history and geography of human genes informed by ancient DNA&quot; Pickrell, Joseph K. et al.

Although we still fail to understand the molecular bases of most complex traits, including many common diseases, we now have a clearer idea of the degree of genetic resemblance between humans and other primate species. We also know that humans are genetically very close to each other, indeed more than any other primates, that most of our genetic diversity is accounted for by individual differences within populations, and that only a small fraction of the species’ genetic variance falls between populations and geographic groups thereof.&quot; Barbujani, Guido, and Vincenza Colonna. &quot;Genetic basis of human biodiversity: an update.&quot; In Biodiversity Hotspots, pp. 97-119.

It prompted me to look into other sleep hacks and since then I&#x27;ve really been able to hone my ability to get great sleep most any night and under any condition — even when the duration isn&#x27;t as long as I&#x27;d like. I really feel like a new person.<p>Here are some of the tricks I&#x27;ve found work well:<p>- Low dose melatonin: I&#x27;ve tried higher doses but there&#x27;s a fair amount of literature out there stating that less is more [0]. My own experiences seem to confirm this, but melatonin definitely affects people differently! I can take it and be able to hop out of bed (morning person), but my gf (who&#x27;s NOT a morning person) has tried it and ended up feeling even more like a zombie. Melatonin&#x27;s definitely not for some people.<p>- f.lux: I&#x27;ve always felt that it gives your screen the quality of the page of a book. It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling, but removing the blue light definitely has a relaxing effect. I&#x27;m at the point now where if I turn off in the evening (maybe to see a graphic) I&#x27;ll actually cringe.<p>- Sleep Cycle app: I started using this app when I read about how timing your wake up based on 90 minute sleep cycles [1] can help you avoid that morning groggy feeling. This was interesting because I&#x27;d definitely had those mornings where I got less sleep than usual but still felt awake – I was always curious about the reason. I&#x27;ve used the app for a little over a year and typically wake up before my alarm anyway, but the app seems to be pretty good at determining when I&#x27;m in the lightest stage.<p>- Earplugs: Living in a city that does garbage collection at 3am prompted this one. Earplugs are my go-to sleep hack whenever I&#x27;m traveling. I&#x27;ve found they help for general concentration as well.<p>I&#x27;m convinced the above helped me successfully complete my masters degree and also hold down 3 jobs (9-5 and 2 after hours startup roles) since then. It might seem like a lot of lifestyle change, but I did it gradually as I learned more about the science of sleep and also experienced the benefits first hand. They probably won&#x27;t work for everyone, but they&#x27;re worth a shot to see if they can help you!<p>[0] <a href=""http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2001/melatonin-1017"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2001/melatonin-1017</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/remember-the-90-minute-rule-to-ensure-a-refreshing-nigh-1551241082"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/remember-the-90-minute-rule-to-ensure-...</a>",1436358772

It is the industry standard, and the best way to learn the foundations.<p>If you want to see how the <i>perfect</i> CG software looks like - check out sidefx Houdini.

1950s, mostly this &quot;sprinting&quot;
that was in practice just too
difficult, that is, too <i>costly</i>
in time and money, for far too
large a fraction of organizations,
budgets, managers, etc. that 
could have used optimization.<p>Now with current computing and 
the Internet, a lot in applied
math, in principal powerful and
valuable for important real problems,
seems to be growing significantly
in popularity.  
The &quot;sprinting&quot;
is much easier but, sadly, 
too often still too challenging.<p>Of course part of the &quot;sprinting&quot;
challenge was solved by, say,
A Mathematical Programming Language
(AMPL) where can just type in
something like<p><pre><code>        max z = f(x)
     subject to g(x) >= 0
                  x in C 
</code></pre>
where for large positive integers
m and n and the real numbers R,
x in R^m and g: R^m --> R^n.<p>So, then, with the problem thusly
typed in, just need a <i>solver</i>!
Right:  Maybe from the back side
of one of the moons of Pluto?<p>Gee, we know how to sort, know a
lot about sorting, in O( n log(n) ),
etc., so maybe we should have
<i>solvers</i> that would do as well
on optimization as we can do now
on sorting?  Then quickly
we encounter the monster of the
question P versus NP.<p>So, without an algorithm that shows
that P = NP, we&#x27;re back to
column generation here, Lagrangian
relaxation there, branch and bound
too often, some group theory
sometimes, etc. and &quot;sprinting&quot;.<p>Yes, it was <i>interesting</i>
philosophically how central
and challenging P versus NP
is, but I&#x27;d rather have just
had a way to solve optimization
problems routinely, gotten

Because the base rate of people who take effective altruism seriously is still so low, it&#x27;s a reasonable assumption to make, but in this case it&#x27;s incorrect. Have a look at how much interaction there is between, for example, GiveWell and Good Ventures (as background, GiveWell places a very strong emphasis on being very sure that what they&#x27;re doing is helping and how much, and Good Ventures focuses more strongly on projects that might do massive amounts of good) [1].<p>Second, it&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re thinking in terms of how money can best be spent to provide the maximal benefit to humanity. You&#x27;re entirely correct that medical interventions in Africa are orders of magnitude more effective per dollar at than, for example, the Make a Wish foundation -- the estimate I&#x27;m familiar with is about $3,000 per life saved, which is pretty impressive [2]. However, continuing that line of thought, tropical diseases and malnutrition have a combined cost of about 200 million DALY&#x27;s annually. The problems we generally consider &quot;just a normal part of aging&quot; (cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, cancer, arthritis, etc.) have a combined cost of about 1 billion DALY&#x27;s annually [3]. My personal opinion is that addressing medical problems in the developing world is probably still more cost-effective than medical research in the developed world, but it&#x27;s not all that clear-cut. When you&#x27;re a billionaire like Thiel, you can afford to put some resources into both ways of improving the world, and either way is still better than buying a fourth yacht.<p>&quot;Angry about death&quot; could mean &quot;if I could step all over others to live forever, I would&quot;, but in this case I don&#x27;t think it does.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/about/official-records/board-meeting-19/givewell-and-good-ventures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.givewell.org/about/official-records/board-meeting...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets#HowcosteffectiveisLLINdistribution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/ins...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61689-4/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-67...</a> (you can register and view the full text, charts, etc. for free).",1436357196

I recall Garbage Collection as an important subject decades before 2000.
I studied CS in the 1970s (and 1980s) and garbage collection was already an
important subject.  It was a part of the ACM recommended CS curiculum
as far back as 1968.  Google Scholar reveals thousands of results for
&quot;garbage collection algorithm&quot; before 1990.  The subject was studied by
great computer scientists (Lamport, Dijkstra, and Liskov are all Turing
award winners) and the results were fun and interesting:<p>1989<p><pre><code>  AW Appel: &quot;Simple generational garbage collection and fast allocation&quot;

The Communications of the ACM, during this period, was the most read
CS Journal.  Articles appearing there were intended to be of interest
to the widest population of computer scientists and 19 of them were on
garbage collection.<p>LISP, APL, LOGO, ML, Prolog, CLU, Scheme, Cedar, Smalltalk, Icon, SML,
Mathematica, J, Haskell, Python, Dylan, Self, Lua and Javascript are
all important, garbage collected programming languages that came
before the late 1990&#x27;s.",1436357191

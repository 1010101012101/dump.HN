This following equates to attention, press, prestige and connections for all the new YC companies.   <p>Without all that, all you have is an angel investor.  And there's nothing new about that.<p>Really, when it comes down to it, this is just an enormous validation for what's happening here.  After all, ""imitation is the best form of flattery.""

15731,comment,15679,15728,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"The way Steve puts it - his original motivation for using python over RoR is that there's too much ""magic"" involved in rails.  I think he doesn't think things being done for him, and rails does a lot for you...<p>That compounded with rails being slower and requiring an entire rewrite of the site, and it seems the decision to move to django is a no-brainer.",1177255902

Several of the businesses I've built in the past are ""lifestyle"" businesses.  They're supporting me, they're paying my way through school, but they're not as much fun as you'd think.  That's why I'm here, after all :)<p>Ask anyone who owns a restaurant, and they'll tell you lifestyle businesses are a lot like working at a 9-5. Only that there's much more to do,  and the income isn't guaranteed.",1177255360

In a time when religious belief looks suspiciously like superstition (which it is) some people crave for tools to deceive themselves that do not involve burning bushes or flying zombies (a thought curiously appropriate today).",1211507606

I use a mac mini with a 23"" screen at home, and I don't take the macbook out much because it's heavy and valuable, so mainly it just sits there doing nothing.<p>I have been planning to get the new eeepc (when it comes out in a week or two) - I hadn't considered a second hand thinkpad.<p>Thanks very much indeed for a great tip.",1211507219
197724,comment,197578,197657,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I moved from Austin to Silicon Valley.  I now know that Austin is not a startup hub (and nowhere else is either).  I used to think it was just a matter of degree, but Silicon Valley is really a dramatically different environment for starting a technology company than anywhere else in the world.<p>I think it's worth noting that even though Boston is considered the ""second place"" finisher in the startup hub races, not a single Y Combinator company has been funded in Boston, and about 90% of those from the Boston YC programs who keep working on their businesses move to the valley.  I don't believe either of these things are accidents of history.<p>I'll move back to Austin when I ""retire"", or maybe even sooner, since a large percentage of our customer base is in Texas, but while we're in a position to need to raise money and to stay on top of the technology world, there's just no other place to be.",1211507113

197716,comment,197634,197634,0,0,joshwa,,,"Two ways to look at Twitter:<p>1) Twitter is like any other social network-- its value to you is dependent on which of your friends is on it. For most of us who have lots of friends that aren't 100% plugged-in to the hottest web trends, this severely limits twitter's value. However, the technorati get a lot of value from Twitter in that it's an elite social network (aka mutual backrubbing), and a way of getting to each other's inboxes (via @ and d messages). The electronic equivalent of TED and Davos.<p>2) Twitter is basically a blog platform in disguise-- where the hordes of wannabes who follow calcanis and ev and scoble really what they're doing is a fancy equivalent of subscribing to their rss feed leaving comments on their blog entries, with the added social bonus of making it seem like you're with the 'in' crowd since you're on twitter leaving @messages for loiclemeur like the big boys do (see 1 above).",1211506248

197702,comment,197634,197634,0,0,nir,,,"Hype.<p>Twitter, by definition, appeals most to the people who are somewhat extrovert, like to talk/write a lot about themselves (see Michael Arrington complaining recently that Twitter's downtime denied him from broadcasting, live, his food poisoning. I Am Not Making This Up)<p>Therefore, these people tend to talk a lot about what they are doing - and thus talk about Twitter, which makes Twitter more well known <i>in our circles</i> than much bigger websites.<p>A classic example is Apple's products, in the pre iPod/OS X days. They had a tiny market share, but a very high mindshare. The reason, in my opinion, was that Apple's user base consisted of many creatives - designers, writers, musicians etc. If Apple computers' users were mostly biologists, civil engineers and plumbers, you wouldn't hear about it nearly as much - even if they had the same market share and the same customer loyalty.<p>Hype seems to be much cheaper now, though. Many Apple products truly had groundbreaking engineering and design. Many Apple users were well known because they were talented and creative. Compare this to to Twitter's technical ""challenges"" (I mean, seriously - it's very minimal in UI/functionality side, as it should be. They got plenty of money and can attract top talent. If not scaling, what have they been doing for the past year?), and its most well known users...",1211504693
197701,comment,197392,197432,0,0,alex_c,,,"<i>Almost every analysis I read, including this one, points to Rails as the major bottleneck but then can't say anything concrete to justify it. This article says that Rails is no good for processing intensive tasks and that you should use C. Rails is a framework for serving web pages, it isn't doing any of the processing or message queueing. I'm sure that Rails won't work out of the box with whatever backend you would need for a stable twitter, but I haven't heard anyone address the actual technical issues. Is it just a matter of having to tweak Rails or is there a reason that Rails is the wrong architecture?</i><p>I agree, I see a lot of confusion about this.  Some just seem to blame it on the language, others on the framework, many can't seem to tell the difference (FTA: ""Rails would do itself no harm by conceding that it isn’t a platform that can compete with Java or C when it comes to intensive tasks."")<p>It doesn't make any kind of sense to blame the language.  Within reasonable limits, the speed of the language is only relevant if you're trying to run everything off one box.  If  you're running more than one server, a slower language just means more servers.  I can't think of any exception to this.<p>What about blaming the framework?  I wouldn't expect it to scale out of the box, fair enough.  But are there any frameworks out there which can scale perfectly, out of the box, without any a priori knowledge of what the system actually does or needs?  If there is a specific crippling flaw in Rails which makes it unable to scale, it should be possible to pinpoint it.<p>In the meanwhile, very little is said about the architecture and the database.  Is there really any problem Twitter needs to solve that is more difficult than those solved by Facebook (friend newsfeeds) or by any chat system (online status updates)?",1211504583

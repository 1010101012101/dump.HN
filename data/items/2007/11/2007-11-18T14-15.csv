Heroes does a great job executing on borrowed ideas from X-Men and other sources.  Moreover, when that execution slips (this season, finale of last year) viewership drops...",1195397257

What a monster (this was after 5+ years of Lisp programming writing a couple of interpreters, teaching it).  A baroque morass, similar in X to complexity.  (Btw, if you're comparing graphics APIs, X is a heck of a lot worse than the Windows API.)<p>To those commenting upon C++ and its metaprogramming complexity -- a lot of your complaints here really focus on the complexity of metacode WRITTEN in C++/templates, not in the template strucure itself.  Even with STL, C++ is simpler and as rich as CL.  If you'll exclude the paradigm shift, of course...

(In my case, even though I'm not doing a facebook app, I've turned down offers with a ""uhh, thanks... but I really don't need any help right now"".)  Different startups require different amounts of manpower, just like different startups require different amounts of capital -- I think most facebook applications easily fall into the ""one person is enough"" category.<p>As for the rest... I'd say they're all relevant to varying degrees.  Probably ""Bad Location"" is less relevant, since it's partly about finding angels and VC (which are less important since facebook apps generally need less capital); while ""Hiring Bad Programmers"" is probably more relevant (if you're hiring anyone at all, at least), since most greybeards are old enough to have not drunk the facebook kool-aid.",1195396983

Many years ago, I faced a sudden engine failure and performed an emergency landing in a minuscule pasture surrounded by a very forested area. It very nearly costed me and my passengers&#x27; lives.<p>The plane was without engine for several minutes before I landed, yet that time was spent fully engrossed and completely focused on the problem. I had clarity of thought like nothing I&#x27;ve ever experienced.<p>No emotions — no fear, nothing — just stone cold rationality. Going through the checklist, Mayday call, considering options, etc. with swift and decisive precision.<p>Though I believe the extensive training certainly helped, to this day I&#x27;m amazed at the incredible stress response our body has evolved. Even though it happened many years ago, I still think about it a lot.",1394225964

Some time after funding was completed backers where contacted regarding a design change and a choice of options, all of which included the company logo on the front of the device. Many backers voiced their concerns with this as the device would no longer be inconspicuous to would be thieves who could easily remove it. Those concerned backers were completely ignored and the logo was put on regardless.<p>There were many delays in shipping the product, this along with a lack of communication left us backers feeling like we&#x27;d been had. Eventually we were told that the products would be shipped, after more delays it turns out that the team decided to use our money to go to CES, money I feel should of been spent on improving the product as they don&#x27;t work.<p>Now that the products have shipped Phone Halo has decided to drop support for android devices that are not running 4.4, which is currently 2.5% of android devices. Although this does not effect me I feel it is extremely dishonest for those with other android devices who backed the project.<p>Also how does the age of my account devalue my opinion?",1394225665

7362672,comment,7359992,7362369,4,0,acqq,,,"Is there anybody here who knows enough Linux internals to say that it has sense to actually seed /dev/urandom by copying to it from /dev/random? I&#x27;d believe it would be enough just to <i>read</i> some limited number of bits from /dev/random once to be sure that the pool is populated according to the /dev/random estimate. Then it should be enough to continue reading /dev/urandom. Anybody?<p>(However even reading a limited number of bits from /dev/random on the first call of your code can freeze the router with no mouse and keyboard (or anything else if this is done often enough). So I still consider the above practice a bad strategy for a library writer. The person who designs the initial OS boot however should think about it. The reason that even Linux kernel doesn&#x27;t do this automatically even once at the start of the whole system is because the kernel developers know that they don&#x27;t have access to enough entropy unless the hardware somehow provides it. I believe having RDRAND type (not in the sense of alleged backdoor but in the sense of a known hardware source) of entropy in every CPU or chipset is actually a good thing solving an actually existing problem. We are far from that state still, unfortunately.)",1394225656

Second, a combination muscle memory and spring feedback usually catch situations where I&#x27;ve missed a key (I can feel that I hit it too lightly). Third, I find some of the mechanical keyboards to be <i>too</i> stiff and require more force to fully press each key, leaving my arms more fatigued at the end of the day.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s individual preference, but the soft clicking I get from my laptop or Microsoft ergo keyboard (low-travel laptop style keys) are more than enough for me.<p>To add to your list of keyboard gripes though:<p>- Keys with sloped sides (an extension of &quot;keytops too close together&quot;) that cause me to hit adjacent keys when I slightly miss<p>- &quot;Fn&quot; and Ctrl keys swapped.

7362670,comment,7362426,7362426,2,0,danso,,,"OK, since someone already trolled about Google Maps (in a poorly reasoned way), I&#x27;ll lodge my own curmudgeonly criticism: mapping is <i>rarely</i> the way to solve anything.<p>Especially in New York, and with standard Google Maps service, it&#x27;s not hard to find where things are. It&#x27;s hard to find that they exist -- and, if they do, whether they fit your need...and clicking around on a map is not the efficient way to do it. Nor to enumerate it.<p>Even the most famous map -- John Snow&#x27;s cholera map -- was not revolutionary in itself. Snow didn&#x27;t find out anything from mapping, it was just part of the documentary process and the one made famous by Tufte. But Snow himself would&#x27;ve concluded that the map was of little evidence, because such maps were used to <i>prove</i> the miasma theory that he was trying to <i>disprove</i>. And his map, without the data that he collected, fell into this visual trap.<p>So what is the way to do things? Use a spreadsheet. Think about the important facets about each entry. And hell, one of those could be &quot;address&quot;, and in literally one step, you can also make a map out of it if you want.<p>And when I mean &quot;especially in New York&quot;, I mean that geographical distance is not the most useful metric. Even when it comes to geography. I prefer proximity to what subway station, and that is a kind of metric that is obscured/obfuscated by a map",1394225625

If you look at the design of an artifact and try to tease out clues to the intentions of the designer, that&#x27;s very interesting to me.<p>Recently there was an essay by Charlie Stross buzzing around, fueled by a particularly contentious passage that suggested that BitCoin looked as if it were designed as a weapon against central banking and tax collection. A good chunk of the techno-nerd community denied it with the standard observation that it&#x27;s just a descentralized protocol, etc.<p>So that conversation was very much like &quot;This knife was designed to make fillet cuts&quot;.  Response:  &quot;No, it&#x27;s just a long sharp blade with an attached handle&quot;.<p>And I came away from that thinking &quot;really, doesn&#x27;t the design of this artifact suggest a little more about its intended purpose?&quot;<p>And then this article comes out and suggests that the anthropological instincts of Charlie Stross vis-a-vis the design intent behind BitCoin may not have been so off the wall after all.  And so that superficially feels somewhat illuminating to me, as someone who would not feel entirely comfortable throwing my weight behind something like that - despite how brilliant and cool BitCoin is on a purely technical level.<p>I also wonder - if we entertain for a moment the hypothesis that Charlie Stross is on to something - does the fact that Nakamoto no longer has any control over it imply that it would no longer behave as designed?",1394225455

If the developer of the software had realized &quot;ok, Linux has this issue, and in practice no one knows that this is a problem&quot;, it becomes under their responsibility umbrella to fix the issue or educate their users. I believe that this becomes even more complex when you are a library developer building a component that is used in larger systems, where the developers using your library are between you and the final users.<p>Put differently: why are we encouraging people to &quot;run with scissors&quot; and allow this mistake to even be possible? Either demand that Linux itself fixes the boot-time entropy hole, encourage developers to seed the entropy pool before relying on /dev/urandom, or encourage developers to only use /dev/random; but it seems &quot;actively harmful&quot; to encourage developers to only use /dev/urandom and then just pray that the system integrator or user understood entropy enough to make the system have a working /dev/urandom by the time it is needed. If I were a pen-tester this would be one of the first things I check for on every setup, as it is a really esoteric issue that almost no one understands well and that apparently developers of even popular software like OpenSSL/Dropbear completely ignores in the name of not accidentally blocking under load.",1394225426

7362641,comment,7359992,7361943,3,0,pbsd,,,"Here&#x27;s my understanding of your argument:<p>- Using /dev/random occasionally blocks applications, but that&#x27;s acceptable because it&#x27;s only a small high-throughtput subset of them, and those users can deal with it themselves.<p>- Using /dev/urandom never blocks, but a small headless subset of devices will in some situations generate predictable streams. This is unacceptable.<p>I fear the assessment of the damage done by /dev/random blocking is understated. When it comes to generating long-term keys, yeah, sure, use /dev/random if you want; it doesn&#x27;t matter how long that takes. But in online applications, these blocks can make an application unusable. Also remember than CSPRNGs are not only used for short key generation: generating CBC IVs is a nice example of something relatively high-throughput that really should not block.<p>You claim that only idiots beyond help will resort to working around /dev/random to prevent blocking. I disagree. I claim that any sufficiently frustrated developer will eventually go down that route if no other obvious choice is available.<p>As an aside, these arguments also put some amount of faith in the entropy estimator&#x27;s quality, i.e., that /dev/random blocks only when it should. This may not be the case, as shown by [1] in (admittedly) somewhat contrived conditions.<p>[1] <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/338"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/338</a>",1394225376

The article speaks of P2P, and goes on to say that transaction logs are uploaded to the cloud. Not P2P then. P2P doesn&#x27;t work anyway, because there&#x27;s no guarantee that any two devices are active at any one time. I&#x27;m pretty sure my understanding of P2P is limited, compared to the author&#x27;s.<p>The other issue is that all approaches described seem to preclude multi-user sync, which is what I&#x27;ve been struggling with. Security also becomes a ball-ache in that changing a password, which unlocks a private key that unlocks a symmetric key that encrypts and decrypts content means storing two copies of any one sync item until all sync clients have the new keys. There are ways of simplifying this, but complexity always creeps back in if I want a zero-knowledge server.<p>The third thing I&#x27;m working on is the idea of multiple, disposable servers. If one goes down, another steps in. If server A offers better comms to device 2 than device 1 which syncs via server B, then device 2 should default to server A without affecting sync scope from device 1.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating subject.<p>Good article, all the same!",1394224699

7362580,comment,7359743,7361901,5,0,wting,,,"> &quot;Functional Programming in C++&quot;<p>> My pragmatic summary:  A large fraction of the flaws in software development are due to programmers not fully understanding all the possible states their code may execute in.  In a multithreaded environment, the lack of understanding and the resulting problems are greatly amplified, almost to the point of panic if you are paying attention.  Programming in a functional style makes the state presented to your code explicit, which makes it much easier to reason about, and, in a completely pure system, makes thread race conditions impossible.<p>> I do believe that there is real value in pursuing functional programming, but it would be irresponsible to exhort everyone to abandon their C++ compilers and start coding in Lisp, Haskell, or, to be blunt, any other fringe language.  To the eternal chagrin of language designers, there are plenty of externalities that can overwhelm the benefits of a language, and game development has more than most fields.  We have cross platform issues, proprietary tool chains, certification gates, licensed technologies, and stringent performance requirements on top of the issues with legacy codebases and workforce availability that everyone faces.<p>> If you are in circumstances where you can undertake significant development work in a non-mainstream language, I’ll cheer you on, but be prepared to take some hits in the name of progress.

Regardless, the IO type is always &quot;async&quot; in the way that Node types define it (or, alternatively, transcends the way Node uses the term entirely); there is no distinction between an IO String that is simply &#x27;return &quot;a string&quot;&#x27; and an IO String that actually hits a web server API to figure out what other web server to hit for a file which will then be fed to an API which will return a string... that&#x27;s still just an &quot;IO String&quot;.<p>Haskell does have a thing from the promise tradition, but it&#x27;s a different definition of &quot;promise&quot; than JS is using here, and it manifests in Control.Concurrent.MVar.

All everything has been saying so far is &quot;do not use /dev/random, use /dev/urandom&quot;, which I maintain is actively-harmful advice and should probably be retracted by everyone saying it: making it into a black/white issue is not just silly but will lead people into a situation where they&#x27;ve made confusing mistakes.<p>This statement so far seems to be well-argued (if nothing else, no one, including yourself, has provided any argument against it; in fact, you seem to presuppose it in all of your statements, assuming that someone smart enough to realize that this is a problem has gone to the trouble of making certain /dev/urandom is seeded sufficiently, despite all evidence to the contrary):<p>&quot;What&#x27;s <i>not</i> fine is relying on /dev/<i>u</i>random as a source of entropy for your application, <i>without first seeding urandom</i>.&quot;<p>Your version, however, seems to only have one argument going for it: that under load a system using /dev/random might block.

Like, seriously: I&#x27;ve now spent hours arguing with you, and you haven&#x27;t actually made any arguments :(.<p>I also, however, have stated (such as in the other part of this thread I linked to while responding to your other comment) that I think that there are opportunities for a more nuanced discussion of this. Humorously, the solution I came up with was different than yours (I suggested blocking on /dev/random once to make certain /dev/urandom is &quot;ready&quot;) and int thinking about it <i>might not work</i> (it relies on an implementation detail of /dev/urandom that I realize I don&#x27;t know), which frankly just goes to underscore my argument: you and this author telling people &quot;do not use /dev/random, use /dev/urandom&quot; is <i>harmful advice</i> that should apparently be replaced by &quot;use /dev/random to see /dev/urandom, and then use /dev/urandom for subsequent random usage&quot;, lest people either 1) use /dev/urandom in a way where it might be used before it is seeded or 2) hear about this issue and then enact some incorrect workaround.",1394224102

At some point in this conversation we were informed that it was no good referencing Live and PSN as nobody in their development teams used those systems (!) so could we provide more detailed explanations for them? My only thought after this call was that they were struggling - badly - with the networking side as it was far more complicated than they anticipated.

It&#x27;s very hazy in my memory, I was pretty young and didn&#x27;t ever work too much in the artwork department. I mostly just made money in the summers doing odd jobs and running errands.<p>One thing I do remember was the endless difficulty in receiving artwork from customers who produced everything in RGB instead of CMYK and IIR converting it for color separation was a huge PIA.<p>I also do remember when FAX machines started to get used more. I&#x27;d say a good 30-50% of my parent&#x27;s business relied on Fax. I think they kept a couple of spare machines in a cabinet in case it failed it was so critical. The first few machines printed on thermal paper, and once spamming fax machines caught on, simply became too expensive. They&#x27;d come back after a weekend and have an entire spool of paper all over the floor full of advertisements and other junk.<p>I think once the web and e-mail started to catch on, and inkjet printers became cheap enough, they definitely felt it and business dropped tremendously. There&#x27;s still no cheaper substitute for printing off a few thousand copies of something that&#x27;s available for home users. But lots of people just get by with e-mail or some alternative to physical copies.<p>Also the state of expectations started to catch up to them. You really couldn&#x27;t own a 1 or 2 color offset print shop anymore. You need to handle 4 color, and do it without a huge cost premium, because everybody wanted full-color brochures and wedding invitations and whatever.

The researchers document that during 1000 trial boots, the only entropy in the returned data was the position in the stream.<p>This is just <i>asking</i> for system integration errors, such as the wide-spread issue with headless routers generating keys at boot. Hell: even the desktop systems tested by the researchers were only just barely managing to run the key generation late enough that the keys weren&#x27;t running into the &quot;deterministic data returned from /dev/urandom&quot; problem.<p>Yes: this is fixable by making certain the system has enough entropy sources and doesn&#x27;t attempt to do anything with /dev/urandom until enough entropy has hit the system to make the data returned actually-random. However, in practice, that isn&#x27;t happening, it isn&#x27;t happening often, and it is trivially defendable against by using /dev/random.<p>As it stands, the <i>only</i> reason anyone has come up with for using /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random is &quot;occasionally /dev/random blocks&quot;. The question is then whether the &quot;sometimes the system blocks under load&quot; is more or less dangerous of a default than &quot;sometimes keys are generated that are actually the same as every other device&quot;.<p>Now, maybe you believe that the former issue is more important than the latter: that people building systems under load are more likely to break them by replacing /dev/random with a file full of constant &quot;random&quot; data (rather than replacing it with, for example, /dev/urandom) than people generating keys at boot without realizing their device is nothing more than a CPU with 16kB of flash and 32MB of ROM attached to a dead network.<p>If you do feel this way, (and it isn&#x27;t at all clear to me, as you still seem to be beating the &quot;/dev/random doesn&#x27;t generate better data than /dev/urandom iff the random entropy pool has been correctly seeded&quot; horse, which I maintain was dead long before I arrived with my argument) I encourage you to read the other comment I&#x27;ve written elsewhere in this thread showing why this seems like a poor choice of default behavior.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7362239"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7362239</a>",1394222902

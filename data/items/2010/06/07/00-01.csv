I was under the impression that resetting the circadian rhythm resulted in negative side effects such as memory loss. I know it's an effective treatment for alzheimer's, however those are in cases when an individuals melatonin production has stopped. As a younger person myself, I did not want to use it regularly and have a completely artificial circadian rhythm. When I did so it resulted in a few blanks here and there in my short term memory.<p>However with some googling it seems the only research that has been done specifically with melatonin where memory loss was shown was in animal studies (gerbils and zebrafish)\n<a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071115164438.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071115164438.ht...</a>",1275872352

Two-way interaction is usually reserved for office hours.<p><i>If you're not enrolled in a course, you would need a patient friend who is an expert in the subject, an extremely patient acquaintance who is an expert, or an expert tutor. All of those are hard to come by.</i><p>Only because learning by watching online lectures currently is not a common method of learning (because the technology necessary for it to be possible has only recently become available). If it were to become more common, these resources would certainly be more readily available. The tutors would also be held to more exacting standards, since there would be competition. At a traditional university, for a given semester for a given course, you're usually forced to select from 1 or 2 professors, whom you can only indirectly evaluate for their performance after the course has ended. But with tutors, you would be free to pick whoever you wanted.<p>Also, most of these professors' primary job is their research, not teaching. The tutors would be focused on teaching, and would thus do a better job of it. Being a good researcher in a field means almost nothing when it comes to teaching undergraduate level material. Some of the professors I've had have been some of the smartest people I've ever met, but their communication & teaching skills have been nothing short of appalling.<p><i>Further, I rarely give straight answers to my student's questions. Their question is usually a symptom of a deeper misunderstanding, and figuring out what that is, and leading them to understand that, is my real job. Someone who just says ""The answer is X"" does not serve the same role as a teacher.</i><p>Competition that would result from the ability to cherry-pick personal tutors for each course would naturally eliminate those who did a poor job of teaching their students, so that wouldn't be an issue either.",1275872214

I have seen following changes really helpful:<p>1. The biggest change that needs to be made, is to have genuine respect for nature's cycles. That is the mindset needs to change from ""We can sleep/wake whenever we want"" to ""Aligning oneself with natures rhythms"". All animals and plants do it, except human beings.<p>2. When looking for apartment, look for apartment which lets more of sunlight in. So bedroom should have window/s which lets lot of light in on to the bed (of course it can be controlled with a blind).\n2. Even during day time, instead of artificial lights, see if sunlight from windows can be used.\n3. Minimize use of monitor(meaning staring at monitor) past 9PM and ideally best to sleep by 10PM. Consistently. Once the pattern is established, your body automatically falls sleep easily around these times.And, with this patten, early morning hours (6AM to 9AM) provide freshest of mind. It is about quality of wakeful hours and not quantity.<p>I've found this to not only provide the best quality of sleep but great clarity of mind and improvement in health.",1275871891

I read Tyler Cowen's ""Create Your Own Economy"" recently and it drove this message home: in a world where there is plentiful, immediate access to information, people want to graze and construct their own meanings and experiences from it - make it into building blocks.<p>This demand is what is pushing us towards a vast accumulation of bite-sized delicacies - 2-minute video clips, 5-minute video games, <500 word blog posts, etc. A lot of classical inefficiencies are cleared out of the way by this - if it's all merit-driven, the work has to be as good as possible for as many people as possible - which means small budgets, a minimum of franchising and lock-in, a minimum of editorializing. It's gotta be tiny and focused, so that it can be reused. Sort of like Unix. There's plenty of room for quality, but it has to stand alone, be very accessible, and not get buried inside a sprawling monolithic work.<p>This doesn't mean that the long form is dead, just that it's more likely to exist in the future as a patchwork composite of generics.

Although having established that:<p>1. the penalty for performing an illegal u-turn in Singapore isn't as harsh as penalties for the same act in America, and perhaps other western nations as well,<p>2. that penalty seems especially lenient in comparison to laws in Singapore that punish more severely behavior that many Westerners would have trouble considering a crime at all (i.e. chewing gum in public or carrying a durian on the metro),<p>3. regardless of the penalty, the average Singaporean is unlikely to be affected by the law, as they are more inclined to ride in taxis or other forms of public transportation,<p>this analogy doesn't seem very apt. Is it just the cute acronym that caused this expression to stick? Or the imagery of making a u-turn being representative of rebelling against the ""path"" as prescribed by authority figures? Maybe Sim Wong Hoo is just popular and knows how to be catchy?<p>There are a great many draconian laws in Singapore which cause its citizens to be unwilling to act without governmental approval. This certainly has some endemic effect on their societal norms as well. I would argue that this has less to do with Singaporeans being risk-averse and more to do with the fact that on the other side of many of those laws a government official is waiting to beat them with a stick. Except, of course, in the case of illegal u-turns.<p>I will admit that having not read <i>Chaotic Thoughts from the Old Millenium</i> I cannot say whether or not the analogy is more clearly defined and/or convincing in the original text.",1275871752

Some courses were too easy and I thought I was wasting my time and considered applying for exemption. By the rulebook, only students who have taken similar courses in polytechnic were eligible. Projects I did on my own time that was more technically advanced than coursework, were not even considered as basis. Attempt to negotiate with professor to work on interesting/new/hard project (that will show my skills and understanding of subject) in exchange of exemption from boring coursework didn't go well either. (Hey, it is not about grades, it's about challenge and doing interesting work.)<p>2. Computer Graphics course,  homework is to design animation of one 3D shape morphing into another one, but scene must be defined as parametric equation (x,y,z,t). I did it with PovRay, submitted scene source files and rendered avi file, but it wasn't accepted because I didn't do it the ""right"" way, which is to use special extension to VRML our professor developed. So I needed Windows to install extension to VRML plugin for Internet Explorer. My argument of ""students should have choice on tools to demonstrate their understanding of theoretical concept"" didn't go anywhere and I got zero for doing it with povray.<p>3. I was not happy about requirement of ""GPA in top X% of class"" to get into undergrad research program. I tried to get around of it with simple hack, if I could convince a professor there will be exception to that rule. Wrote a long letter to 4 professors explaining about myself, attached the abstract of research I was planning to do. All replied and met with them to talk about it. Learned that they don't have any influence/power on selection of students. Later e-mailed to who was responsible and got to quick and short NO.<p>If it were not my laziness, above things shouldn't have happened in first place. What I mean is, I don't want to sound like I am completely right on all situations here,  I am just telling some anecdote stories about NUT syndrome I witnessed. Am I being unreasonable for expecting special treatment from school? They all sounds like common sense to me but answer was no every single time I asked something outside of the rules.",1275871434

The problem is that it requires extraordinary effort to keep up, you can't shake off the unnatural feeling that you're living on someone else's schedule and (ultimately) you are not as creative, explosive, productive and even happy as you are when you fall asleep at 3am and wake up at 11. I've done a few months of your normal routine and it sucked. Sure I felt rested and in sync with others, but everything great I've built in life had happened between 10pm and 4 in the morning.<p>I am firmly convinced that I am not biologically ""wired"" to going to sleep at 11pm like a robot, simply because someone turned of the lights. I get this intense long-lasting spike of energy when the sun goes down. Every time I switch to a regular people schedule I start missing that feeling and my productivity suffers a big deal.<p>Here is what I do: I enjoy my lifestyle. It feels great to be awake when the time slows down and the city finally comes to a stop, I've tried waking up really early (someone said it feels the same) but not - not even close. This precious time offers me relief, relief from the pressures of modern life, our rat race of schedules, mortgage payments, poor sales and shrinking savings. It's so much easier to concentrate on a problem at hand.",1275869983

His declaration led to the biggest single-day rise on the German stock market which allowed Schmitz to sell his shares and pocket $1.5 million profit.

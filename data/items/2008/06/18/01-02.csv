220429,comment,220344,220344,0,0,softbuilder,,,"I think it is pretty obvious: Reddit is releasing their own distro, where users can mod portions of the system up or down. On most systems this means you'll only be allowed to edit in vi or emacs (sorry pico!). Of course, that could change daily as opinion shifts. Oh, and an hourly cron job will come standard that will remind you to support Ron Paul and/or Dennis Kucinich.",1213754046
220428,comment,220427,220427,0,0,rcoder,,,"That's a pretty astonishingly limiting question, but I would recommend that you go for Java, if you're only going to do one systems language. As a new programmer, (which I assume you must be) the ""power user"" features of C++ (pointer arithmetic, templates, operator overloading) are going to be more confusing than useful.<p>Really, though, if you only have time to learn <i>one</i> language, make it something you can get some real use out of early on, like Python, PHP, or Ruby. Learning C++ or Java alone could be more of an exercise in masochism than anything else.",1213753850

It's what Firefox 2 and every other browser has.<p>And according to my IRC conversation with someone on #firefox # irc.mozilla.org earlier, Firefox 3.1 will have the option of having. They even have the patches all ready. So why it's not in Firefox 3 is beyond me.",1213753430

220422,comment,219993,219993,0,0,rcoder,,,"My small team (two network people, one sysadmin, two devs, one manager) gets a lot of mileage out of DokuWiki for project and systems documentation. It's fast, has good plug-ins, and stores pages in the filesystem, which we consider a plus because it makes backups and versioning a snap.<p>When we're collaborating with larger groups, though, we tend to pick Redmine by default. It offers a nice combination of ticketing, project management, and documentation features, without the learning curve of a traditional wiki or the deployment headaches of something like Confluence.",1213753293

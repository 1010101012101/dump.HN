8815997,comment,8813883,8815846,0,0,puckmunch,,,"Discrete GPUs are soldered to boards using ball-gate arrays, a technique which was invented with lead solder balls in mind. The patent holder died before the EU mandated non-lead solders.<p>The reason this matters is because the process by which those solder balls are made does not check for the presence of voids in them. At least 10% of these balls (regardless of composition) x-ray as having voids.<p>GPUs go through the most radical thermal shifts of any surface mounted component. Lead has a sense of humor about that kind of temperature change; tin alloys do not and begin to crack after a sustained number of shifts. This happened on my 2011 MBP which was not used for gaming.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the iMacs made the same year, where the discrete GPU was a replaceable daughtercard, had a voluntary recall for exactly the same reported video problems. The irony here is that the average cost of having a GPU reballed is about $150US, with a high rate of reliability compared to reflowing. Part of that reliability comes from reballers refusing to use anything but lead.<p>The EU is directly responsible for this problem but Apple is responsible to its users and with a cash reserve outstripping the US Treasury&#x27;s, could have absorbed the cost of repairing these MBPs easily.",1419965488

However, for whatever reason, the only way I could get any financial validation was to have leverage, which in this case was another job.

In my case, my leverage was another great opportunity for a lot more money.<p>I suspect I&#x27;m not the only one on HN that focuses on doing a great job and not on directly advancing their career. So, my advice to you is always have leverage when negotiating and don&#x27;t be afraid to use it. However, there are 2 caveats. 
1. You have to be willing to take the other job - your company may not be interested in retaining you.
2. Having a job offer is very different than just being disgruntled, from the company perspective. But, tread lightly, you want to come across as wanting to stay, but unable to ignore the financial or professional disparity",1419965432

8815978,comment,8814579,8814579,0,0,mgr86,,,"Here is my dilemma as I consider if I should double down on JavaScript and adopt it on the severside. Is there an alternative for the web? and publishing as a whole?<p>We are a small shop. Two people and hope to grow. We publish a web database. Our market is academics, libraries, and scholars. Our Data must be kept in XML. It just makes the most senese.<p>But we are spread over a half dozen different languages. Halfway proficient at all of them, but as we move around to a new project and set one language aside to pick up the other we  regress. What we had known must be relearned, the way we were thinking must be retrained.<p>If we created our web services, our internal API&#x27;s, our production system all largely in the same language we should, I think, we come more proficient and quicker in this language. At the end of the day we need a well functioning, <i>modern</i> web application. So I have no alternative but to be very current in javascript it feels.<p>Might as well set aside our old Java 5 app. Might as well not create a new python project as fun as it is for me when I am the only one that can understand the python. Might as well stop pouring all my efforts into a silo. Why note double down on javascript.<p>A key source of inspiration for this line of thinking is from a conference presentation I saw given from some at O&#x27;riely. They were experimenting with their upstream source of their products being HTML5. The HTMLBook[1] project seems to logical enough. Their output is almost exclusively HTML. Be it on the web, the ereader (epub/mobi) or with the PDF. They were using Attenahouse to convert HTML to PDF using CSS.<p>Why mess around with several different languages. Keep it simple, and produces nice things quickly. If they aren&#x27;t as nice as you hope refactor. With not having to retrain parts of your brain for javascript as you were working on a Python project exclusively for the last month and a half we should be that much quicker.<p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook</a>",1419965246

With such a workload, the scheduler/governor may enter a situation where the workload moves from one CPU core to the other (*), with no core reaching enough average load to switch it to a higher frequency.<p>I can&#x27;t find a reference for this, but it was easy to reproduce by writing a simple program with pthreads doing what is described above.

It doesn&#x27;t say anything about &quot;warrantless bulk collection of encrypted communications&quot;.  The &quot;warrantless&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense in that you don&#x27;t need a warrant to collect purely foreign communications, and the &quot;bulk&quot; part neither has evidence to back it up nor does it make sense: why would the NSA stored every single piece of encrypted traffic and devote the (expensive) time and energy needed to decrypt it all if they didn&#x27;t have reason to believe it was of significant value.

If there is evidence of them using that legal authority to intentionally target Americans, please do write in to the papers because that&#x27;s cut and dry illegal.<p>It seems like you&#x27;re mixing up the 215 and 702 programs, which collect dramatically different information from completely different groups.  215 is the bulk domestic phone records program - the NSA gets the number called, calling number. date/time, call length and trunk identifier.  They don&#x27;t get the identities behind the phone numbers, locations, etc.  702 is collection against specific foreign targets using US providers - they get the full take on that.<p>> Perhaps he should have said attorneys?<p>The relevant part is: <i>&quot;so that appropriate procedures may be established to protect such communications from review or use in any criminal prosecution&quot;</i><p>> (It&#x27;s not all they are doing.)<p>> You may want to look into what else is being done with the records.

One embarrassing set of articles in particular was the Angry Birds disclosures: the newspapers gawked about how the NSA could be collecting everyone&#x27;s marital status, incomes, sexual preferences, etc., but it was discovered that the newspapers improperly redacted the documents and the redactions were removed, it turned out that the NSA was using the information to track Al Qaeda in Iraq.  I see lots of accusations that the NSA is spying on regular people, but the only disclosures I&#x27;ve seen talking about their targeting are along these lines: <a href=""http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/09/nsas-strategic-mission-list.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2014/09/nsas-strategic-mis...</a><p>I&#x27;ve been following this issue closely.

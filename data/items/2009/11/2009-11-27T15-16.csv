We now face a difficult hurdle in a difficult industry in a difficult economy: the store must move—or close.<p>Luckily, we found a better space (more books! room for events!) but we need the funds to make it happen. Maybe you've sold books when you've had a cash crunch — well, that's exactly what we're looking to do now, only on a bit bigger scale: 
Ten days. Five thousand books.<p>That's right — selling five thousand books in our inventory (of 19,000) will raise the cash we need to fund the move, hire staff, and set up bigger and better than before in a new location a few blocks away. (Don't worry, still in Inman Square area, and we'll bring the Chicken Machine with us.)</i><p>-----<p>A couple of thoughts:<p>A) This sounds like a much better presented fundraiser and is not terribly different from any other sales event where someone says ""We are moving and we would rather sell our existing inventory to you at steep discount rather than move it.""  It still places too much emphasis on the pity factor -- on the idea that this is a fundraiser rather than a business model sales event -- and I still think that is a mistake.  Most people are not interested in meeting the needs of your business so you can stay in business.  Generally speaking, they expect you to meet their needs and for you to figure out a pricing model/business model that will keep the doors open so you can continue to meet their needs.<p>B) If you are serious about being willing to support them, you can buy a certificate online at the above page. There are a couple of places that indicate you can buy books through them online, though I am not figuring out how to do that. However, since you implied you would be willing to donate money and view it as a good cause, hey, here is your chance to do so: Buy a certificate and don't redeem it.  Voila.  Donation.",1259334168

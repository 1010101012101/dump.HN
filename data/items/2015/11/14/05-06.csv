In fact APT was abandoned by it&#x27;s original maintainer and kinda sucked until something like 2007 or 2008 when someone else started working on it again.  But you know rose colored lenses.<p>WU has never really been about software installation or upgrade, it&#x27;s focus has always been about bug fixes and security patches.  Silverlight and IE are the only apps that have ever been upgradable via WU and for IE that&#x27;s been a relatively new occurrence primarily driven by getting users off of older insecure versions.  So really Silverlight is only app ever distributed via WU.<p>You also have to consider that APT was a solution to the horrible experience of getting and installing Debian libraries and applications which still is a pain in the ass without APT.  Windows never had the problem, apps that were available for download were easy to download and install.<p>Keep in mind that APT is for opensource software and doesn&#x27;t have to deal with authentication and authorization of software licenses.<p>And since WU isn&#x27;t a store front and most Windows software isn&#x27;t free, opening up WU to 3rd party apps would probably have come with distribution costs that I would wager most app developers wouldn&#x27;t pay.<p>So again not a very fair comparison.",1447479351

After I resigned from my company in 2012 after a fallout with my partners, the highest trafficked job search website in Nigeria - Jobberman - reached out to me to take up the recently open position of CTO. The expectations brought on an overwhelming feeling of being an impostor. There were a number of things I was doing for the first time, and a number of situations I had never been in prior. For instance:<p>- I had built numerous medium traffic web applications in the past but had never done MySQL replication.<p>- I had not had the privilege of managing an application that averaged 4000 visitors at any given time.<p>- As much as I had a good working knowledge of administering servers, I wouldn&#x27;t say I had up to a 100 hours in total of administering Linux machines. I had been a Windows server guy for years, but had a couple of personal apps running on Linux VMs<p>- I had never done application performance monitoring<p>I could go on and on, but these thoughts exaggerated the negatives so much in my head that as much as I knew I had work to do, and knew how to teach myself to do it, I knew I didn&#x27;t deserve the role. In the end, I did my best and transformed the company&#x27;s infrastructure but never did get to shake off the feeling.<p>I can go on and on about why I did feel that way but I guess like the blog post says, we can think always of more ways to cut ourselves down, than otherwise.<p>Being more active on IRC has helped dispel this feeling over time. Self realization when discussing with people you believe should know more than you do also helps - less than two weeks ago, some developer friend of mine was excitedly telling me how they recently learned of the format of IPv4 addresses, something I probably knew before I turned 12. Blogging more often is something I intend to get back to as well.

Instead, Python 3 went far beyond things that were easily convertible and it isn&#x27;t surprising that adoption was greatly slowed.<p>C++ has <i>atrocious</i> defaults, where you have to add a bunch of keywords and do all these things just to make the simplest classes do the &quot;right&quot; thing.  It&#x27;s long overdue for some new behaviors.<p>Adding things like &quot;override&quot; to existing code has been an absolute joy.  It has <i>already</i> prevented errors during maintenance in projects at work.  It is well worth a few days of ugly revision control logs.<p>There are lots of ways to smooth a backward-incompatible transition for C++ on a larger scale.  For instance, they could enable it on a file-by-file basis by having some new declaration like &quot;using c++17;&quot; (or better still, require only the old, out-of-date files to add this declaration in order to continue compiling).",1447477344

1640257,comment,1639596,1639933,0,0,pquerna,,,"Disclaimer: I am not speaking as or for the Apache Software Foundation, I am speaking entirely for my personal opinion in this post.<p>Oracle is suing a downstream user of Apache Harmony.  Even if they are not attacking the Apache Software Foundation directly, it is a dangerous situation when downstream users are sued for Patents.<p>If someone was suing users or re-distributors of the Apache Web Server, HTTPD, it would be the same situation.<p>It is important to understand that so far, and until I see more information, most and possibly all of the patents used in litigation are related to Dalvik, and not the class libraries.  Apache Harmony has its own VM, DRLVM, which is not used in Android.<p>I believe it is still disturbing that Oracle is aggressively using Software Patents in the open source Java Realm.  It creates a chilling effect on the future of the JVM as a platform in my opinion.<p>Oracle has not approached the ASF -- as others have mentioned, the ASF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit foundation, and a legal battle with Oracle would decimate any money we have, and that means Oracle couldn't extract any money from us anyways.<p>Internally the ASF is struggling with how to respond.<p>There is a general consensus within the members about the dislike of Software Patents, as you find within most groups of Software Developers.<p>However, there is not a general consensus about what the ASF could do, if anything.  The ASF could write blog posts about the general issue, we could be more aggressive on the publicity side, but all of those are like poking a Grizzly Bear with a needle and hoping it doesn't rip your arm off.<p>In addition, because many members of the Apache Software Foundation have been or are currently employed by both Oracle/Sun, and Google, and/or have internal knowledge of things like the JCP, it is not a 'good' thing for the ASF to speak too early in this issue and become a victim smashed between two billion dollar legal teams.  It is also likely in the event of a longer legal battle, many ASF members might be called in testify, further complicating what role the ASF as a foundation should have.<p>Everyone believes that many large companies have dozens or even hundreds of Software Patents that could apply to the various ASF projects, and we mostly exist in a peaceful state.  Oracle has certainly changed that perspective.  I don't know what the foundation will do going forward.<p>The Oracle suit has validated the strict rules that the ASF imposes by use of Contributor License agreements, and tracking of where all our source code has come from.  Some open source developers choose to ignore these problems, but good governance is an important attribute if you want to defend against things like Oracle or SCO.",1282942689

1640241,comment,1639712,1639751,0,0,Mc_Big_G,,,"I'm currently in the beginning phase of A/B testing prices on ForeverList.com right now.<p>Here's how it works: The ""general"" category is assigned a base price of $1.  All other categories are assigned ""price multipliers"". For example, the price multiplier for cars is 15. So, to list a car would be $15.<p>I have a table of ad codes which modify the base price by a factor of 1 to 5. When the site recognizes an ad code passed as a url parameter, it uses this multiplier, plus the category multiplier to determine the price shown to the user.  So, for example, using an ad code with a price multiplier of 5 would make ""general"" listings $5 and a ""cars"" listing $75.<p>In addition, each ad code can have an associated promotion. Each promotion has a flat discount or is percentage based.  So, an ad with a 5x multiplier and an associated promotion of 50% off would be $37.50.<p>When a user signs up, the ad code is associated with their account and they are always show the same prices.  Likewise, returning users that haven't signed up are shown the same price as long as they haven't deleted their cookies.  I get an email when a user is shown a price change just to be aware of how often this is actually happening and if it's becoming an issue.<p>If the user clicks on ad 1 and then ad 2, which have both different price multipliers and promotion percentages, the multiplier stays the same but the percentage off changes if the new percentage is higher.<p>I haven't executed the full test yet, but the idea is to find the optimum price at which users will buy a listing.  If you want to see it in action, try this:<p>1) Go to <a href=""http://foreverlist.com/why"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foreverlist.com/why</a><p>2) Open a new tab and go to <a href=""http://foreverlist.com/why?ad_code=FBSV45k"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foreverlist.com/why?ad_code=FBSV45k</a> (multiplier 2x and 25% promotion)<p>3) Clear your ForeverList cookies.  In firefox this would be edit->preferences->privacy->show cookies, put foreverlist in the search field and click remove for each one.<p>4) Open a new tab and go to <a href=""http://foreverlist.com/why?ad_code=FBLuzq6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foreverlist.com/why?ad_code=FBLuzq6</a> (multiplier 5x and 50% promotion)<p>5) Compare the example price at the bottom of the comparison chart in the ""foreverlist"" column in tabs 1, 2 and 3.<p>I'm writing up a detailed blog post about the experiment, so if you're interested in the results I'll probably post it here or you can just check back on the site directly (There will be a ""blog"" link).  I'm also working on improving the site design, so the full-blown test may be delayed for that.<p>After I've determined the optimum price and implement that permanently on the site, I plan to issue a refund to anyone who paid a higher price and thank them for their patronage, etc...<p>I'm hoping there is a market for ForeverList, jacquesm/tptacek are right about pricing and the winning ad isn't the one with a price multiplier of 0. :)",1282942372

1640216,comment,1638567,1638567,0,0,edj,,,"There's a lot of excellent advice here. Beyond keyboard shortcuts, there's a universe of options to help combat RSI. Here are some of the things I do:<p>1) Posture. You want your eyes to be on the same plane as your screen so your back and neck are straight. You want your elbows to be be bent at around a 90-degree angle--that helps keep your wrists straight. And you want your shoulders to be relaxed, not hunched.<p>2) Breaks. Both long and short. I used to use software for this, specifically AntiRSI for Mac. I think I did an 8 minute break every 52 minutes and a 30 second break 5 minutes or so. Now that I've built up better habits I don't use this software anymore.<p>3) A good chair. My favorite is the Swopper. It's quite expensive, though--around $600 I think. Right now I have standing desk and no chair. I like this set up even better than sitting on an ergonomic chair.<p>4) A good keyboard. I like ""clicky"" keyboards in the vein of the old IBM Model M. I use a DAS Keyboard. Costs around $100. It's not ergonomic per se, but the mechanical keyswitches provide great feedback so you can reduce your keystroke pressure to just the right level.<p>5) Physical therapy aids. I use Theraputty during my microbreaks. It's like silly putty, only it comes in various levels of resistance. I like green, which is medium-firm. Costs like $5 on Amazon. Some people also use the colored rubber bands, but that's more for elbow and shoulder work and my RSI is all in the wrist/hand.<p>6) Other activities. Rock climbing has very nearly cured my RSI. When I climb regularly my hands, wrists, and forearms are strong enough that keyboarding can't touch them.<p>I suspect fighting RSI is like fighting obesity (though I only have the former so I can't be sure): it's all about building good habits. There's no magic bullet and you can't simply cure it and be done. It's an always on-going process. Hope this helps. Good luck!",1282942053

The developers dropped prices/rents, which caused the owners of smaller, older apartment buildings to drop rents by as much as 50%.<p>Developing in non-urban areas would be really subject to local zoning.<p>In any event, remove housing from the university cost - e.g. a student living at home - and you're still looking at a low of $10K per year. ($1K/class * 5 classes/semester * 2 semesters) That's not accounting for probably another $300 in miscellaneous fees.

Yes, in some implementation of closure, both foo and bar access the same closed variable x.<p>The best way to treat this is to view closed variables as global variables in different scopes.  Global variables imply they are shared.<p>e.g.<p><pre><code>  x = 1    // environment in the global scope

  function baz()
    // environment in baz's scope shared by foo and bar
    x = 3
    foo = function() { x += 1 }
    bar = function(){ x -= 1 }
    return [foo, bar]

  foo1, bar1 = baz()  // create a baz_env1 [x:3]
  bar1()   // baz_env1 [x:2]
  foo1()   // baz_env1 [x:3]
  foo1()   // baz_env1 [x:4]
    
  foo2, bar2 = baz()  // create a baz_env2 [x:3]

But I still dislike ""toughness,"" and I think using that term invites the sort of misinterpretation that we're seeing here. Here's why.<p>I have met quite a few folks in business who seem to think... well... they would never use this term or say it like this, but they basically think that it takes a sociopath or someone with narcissistic personality disorder to start a successful business.<p>I've seen several examples of this in action... of people who <i>put up</i> with or even <i>fund</i> downright abusive off-the-charts-narcissistic personalities because they were convinced that those are the sorts of people who will be successful.<p>The thing is: this doesn't match what I've seen in terms of actual success. Granted, I don't have 300 examples. I have about five. But what I've seen is that success is determined by good market research, good analytics, iteration, perseverance, intelligence, and a bit of luck. There are lots of factors, but those seem to be the big ones.<p>In the narcissistic world of startups, the term ""toughness"" is going to bring to mind narcissism and sociopathic behavior. There are just too many bad examples. Use another word, like ""perseverance"" or ""resourcefulness"" and your point will be better taken.",1282939475

Make these second nature. Also, of course, learn the keyboard commands for your most-used applications. You can add and change many keyboard shortcuts in the Keyboard preferences pane in System Preferences. Make liberal use of this to make the commands you use most often the easiest to remember and invoke.<p>I used Quicksilver devotedly for years, but it became much less stable with Snow Leopard. It may be better now that it's under more active open-source development, but I'm happy with LaunchBar. Certainly one of those two (or Butler, or Alfred, or there's probably others) will allow you to perform basic filesystem tasks (launching, opening, moving, copying, duplicating, opening a document with a specific application, etc. etc.) with a few quick key commands.<p>A general suggestion: Don't try to learn every single keyboard shortcut all at once -- it'll never work. Instead, figure out the single most common reason you're reaching for the mouse, and replace that with a keyboard method. Once that's second nature, repeat the process. You'll be surprised at how quickly you can learn this way.<p>Use shell scripting, AppleScript, Automator, Keyboard Maestro, and/or Hazel to simplify anything you do repeatedly. Once you've reduced mouse use, you can use these tools to reduce keyboard use as well!<p>Good luck.",1282939408

He sent me along to an interview for the position of in-house developer (yup, the only one) with a company based in central London.<p>The interview went well at first, but after the first 15 minutes, I sensed something was amiss. The damned recruitment agent had edited my CV to say that I was a Perl developer with 5 years experience. I explained this to the 5 people interviewing me, and to be honest, they were lovely about it.<p>In fact... a bit too nice about it. They wanted me to inherit their complex Perl-based system, despite me not having a clue about the language. I explained at length why I wouldn't be a good hire, but still they wouldn't end the interview.

It simply disconnects the battery from the circuit, which means the only leakage is chemical (self-discharge), and thus very slow.<p>To clarify this point: ""discharge fully"" =/= zero percent.

3624902,comment,3624203,3624203,17,0,jonnathanson,,,"I worked in the mailroom at a major Hollywood talent agency after graduating from a top school. Granted, the literal ""mailroom"" phase of my employment lasted all of a month or two, after which I was promoted to assistant. As an assistant, you're basically a secretary to one of the agents in the firm. Eventually, you prove your competence and rise to the ranks of the training program, in which case you're still doing secretarial work -- but you're doing it for one of the firm's partners. And you're steadily accruing other responsibilities, such as script evaluation, client scouting, studio networking, and so forth. Depending on the agency, your workday is usually a minimum of 10 hours (mine were typically 14 to 15 hour days, and the occasional 20 hour day was not unheard of). The pay was in the $20-30k range.<p>There were plenty of Ivy League grads in my mailroom class. Even a few MBAs, and a Harvard JD. Landing the mailroom gig at this particular agency was extremely difficult, and the folks playing the ""lottery"" all could have taken six-figure (or close to it) entry-level jobs elsewhere.<p>Why did we do it? For no better reason than the fact that ""it's always been this way,"" and ""this is the way it is."" (Or the more economically rationalized supply/demand explanation: there are 500 bazillion gajillion people lining up at the door to get these jobs, so demand always exceeds supply, and thus wages are low and the work brutal).<p>For those who really love the entertainment business, and who are ambitious enough to ""pay their dues"" in the toughest epicenter of it -- the agency world -- it's the best way to get a foot in the door. If you survive the agency meatgrinder, you are highly sought-after among other Hollywood firms: be they studios, networks, production companies, or what have you. It's not unheard of to hit the mailroom at 22, make junior agent by 25 or 26, and be making a very respectable living somewhere by 30. And for those truly ambitious, ruthless souls who go on to be big-time producers or studio heads, you can be making obscene amounts of money in your late-30s to 40s.<p>It's definitely a ""lottery ticket"" model, with some echoes of the ancient apprenticeship model thrown in for good measure (all the bigshots in Hollywood were, themselves, in the mailroom back in the day). The model burns out probably greater than 90% of the hopefuls who leap into it. And that seems a pretty inefficient way to find a small handful of Katezenbergs, Geffens, Dillers or Eisners in the haystack.<p>More important, the model burns through a lot of would-be superstars who simply don't have the tolerance for the indignity, BS, and luck-dependency[1] that comes along with the dues-paying years. These are people who may leave the business and go on to do some pretty amazing things in other industries (tech, for instance). Seems to me that you could still find your Dillers and Katzenbergs in a more tech-style model -- i.e., putting people to work actually making product, rather than answering telephones -- while probably finding a lot more of them in the process.<p>The problem with the Hollywood hiring model, as it currently exists, is that it selects solely for the most ruthlessly ambitious candidates -- the ones who can survive years of toil in pursuit of a big paycheck. If they are also great thinkers, or innovators, or creative geniuses, that's sort of a secondary consideration. The model gets what it selects for, and often nothing more than that.<p>[1]Ultimately, what burns out most people <i>isn't</i> the indignity of the work, but the dependency on dumb luck: the fact that there is no guarantee of work in / reward out. You may kick serious ass in your apprenticeship, only to find out that there are simply no spots open at the next level up. (It's understandable that someone who's just spent 4 of the best years of her life as an indentured servant, only to be told that she needs to put in another 4, would opt out altogether.)",1330005189
3624901,comment,3624505,3624619,1,0,meiji,,,"Essentially, you can ""sell"" rights to negotiate with you exclusively. It's often used so that the seller can focus on a single party but gets a reasonable payoff if the sale doesn't go ahead for any reason. The other party therefore has to commit resource and won't just do it for the sake of doing it. I've usually seen it done when there are, say, 3 or 4 interested parties to narrow it down to 1 in the first instance. On some occasions the party that had exclusivity drops out and it's either a good thing as the other parties are still there or a bad thing as a serious buyer dropping can raise alarm bells.",1330005184

But Tesla's statement did nothing to refute the article, it just stated that you have to put oil in a regular car, and that you can optionally have the car contact Tesla if it gets low.<p>The oil analogy Tesla and others are using just doesn't work.

Now 95% of your documents are wrong, missing those changes.  Maybe you have linkages between different types of document (akin to a foreign key) - now a lot of those might be pointing to nothing.<p>In this model, it's the application's job to anticipate and work around these inconsistencies.   Assertions that check for data integrity, if you have them, have to be modified to work around this.   For a lot of the web applications we talk about these days, who cares - it's people's lists of friends and TODO notes.  It's simple data and some dangling records aren't going to hurt anyone.<p>In the SQL world, we instead write migration scripts that migrate the structure and data all at once.    This is a little more work up front, but as long as you stuck to a mostly normalized form and use great tools (which we now have) this is not a big deal (""MONTHS"" to migrate across slaves sounds like they had some very wrong decisions made earlier on).   The application can move straight to supporting the new structure and entirely forget that the old one existed.   In this world, we can also have really complex relationships between fields, like when we're storing accounting or medical data linked to temporal records of changes.

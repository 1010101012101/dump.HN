9367305,comment,9367080,9367246,0,0,6d0debc071,,,"If you think of the bandwidth/latency of not being connected to the Internet as zero, and think of the bandwidth/latency of being connected to the Internet as some nonzero value, then this is a difference of degree, and not of type, with any other net neutrality discussion we might have. Net neutrality would dictate that you cannot charge differently for different streams of data. Here, the cost to the user with respect to a certain set of streams would be zero in one case and some non-zero value in another case.<p>Now, one could argue that it is not a violation of net neutrality because the data is still being paid for – it is simply being paid for by another source. However, I find these arguments unconvincing. If the intention of net neutrality had simply been to ensure that data was paid for, then it would not matter if data was treated better or worse based upon some payment of a company. After all, the data would still be being paid for – it would simply be that some data was being paid to have faster service associated with it. In principle, that latter example would be no different to an end user of the ISP paying for a faster connection.",1428929643

On the other side you have a larger number of potential future customers.   As they say &quot;a bird in the hand is worth more than than two in the bush&quot;.<p>Of course the customer is never taking the product in exactly the direction you want it to take.  But there are few things less valuable to a company than a close relationship with customers and visibility into their needs.<p>If your consulting clients&#x27; needs and your planned product&#x27;s capabilities aren&#x27;t aligning, how about adjusting the plan rather than dropping the clients?

Sometimes, non-technical CEOs are very good at their own speciality (selling, motivating, etc.) but extremely bad at systems thinking.<p>Other times, CEOs hire yes-men and yes-women below them and everyone is afraid/unwilling to tell the CEO the truth.<p>Other times the company has raised a ton of money and attracts people who would otherwise not work at a startup and whose major focus is resume building and moving to the next job.<p>If the CEO is the only person meeting with investors or only trusts one or two other people to meet with them that is another big concern. It means there is likely no transparency into the actual team and what is actually going on, which means the CEO is likely BSing the investors.<p>All of these are reasons why you should not work at a startup if you do not 100% believe in the CEO.  Be skeptical b/c most startup CEOs really do not have a track record of insight and integrity.

I would explain how freedom to share would lead to greater innovation at lower cost, greater economies of scale through more open standards, etc., and people would universally respond &quot;It&#x27;s a great idea, but it will never work, because nobody is going to pay money for free software.&quot; After two years of polishing my rhetoric, refining my arguments, and delivering my messages to people who paid for me to fly all over the world, I never got farther than &quot;It&#x27;s a great idea, but . . .,&quot; when I had my second insight: if everybody thinks it&#x27;s a great idea, it probably is, and if nobody thinks it will work, I&#x27;ll have no competition!&quot;<p>My favourite free advice (worth what you paid for it): similar to what the original article stated, the &quot;innovation path&quot; is for the gold prospectors going out to make it rich.  Trying to make a differentiator and then get paid multiples on your good idea won&#x27;t work for free software because everybody gets to use your good idea.<p>Free software business models require you to execute at a level higher than anyone else can execute.  Usually if you are the person who built that infrastructure, you have an edge, but it really is all about building a viable business, not building crazy software.<p>In that way, I think free software businesses are inherently less risky.  Often you don&#x27;t need VC, because if you can&#x27;t get people to pay for your services, you are SOL anyway.<p>From your short message, you seem to understand this.

Probably not, and OpenStack for the little guy is a bit of an oxymoron.  It&#x27;s pretty hands on.  I can see where they&#x27;d have problems, and I also think it&#x27;s likely is that there aren&#x27;t a lot of OpenStack customers - but there are some very very large ones, so it&#x27;s a huge fight to get someone to pay you - and not someone else - for something.<p>But most of the time, there&#x27;s nothing particularly interesting in OSS business models except finding the right line of how much you are going to give away.  In fact, I&#x27;d say you have an advantage out of the gate in getting people to be interested in what you do, that makes some parts easier.<p>I still think SaaS models (.com&#x27;s, websites), etc, may be more easier though, to avoid the need to maintain that balance.  But can you do that in systems software?  Not so much, with a few exceptions for hosted monitoring.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s possible to build a good product company on OSS bits - and a services company can be something a lot of companies don&#x27;t want to build.  You just have to find the right line, but I think this was really about product/market fit, and not about open source business model failure, per se.",1428927865

Some people used to perceive it as an implication that you were in need of charity, i.e. that the reason you&#x27;d offer a tip to a waiter but not to an architect for rendering good service is that you didn&#x27;t respect the waiter as a professional in the same sense that you respected the architect.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s contextual, e.g. in Greece the traditional norms were that tipping young people working at a restaurant as employees was fine, but tipping an owner-operator of a family-run restaurant could offend them, being taken as an implication that you thought they couldn&#x27;t manage as an independent businessman, and needed a gift. Instead if you particularly liked their service, the socially acceptable way to show it was to either order more things, or return for another meal later; that way you gave them more money but in the form of more business, rather than an outright gift. (Nowadays this is only really an issue if you&#x27;re Greek, especially a Greek from the same town, where tips, especially large ones, might be taken as having some kind of odd social implication. If you&#x27;re a foreigner, tips aren&#x27;t going to offend anyone, and are perceived basically the way North Americans would expect, as a thank-you for particularly good service.)",1428927501

Then, you take a weekend in the woods and you feel that nothing is wrong.<p>My point is that many times we are not aware what is it that makes us feel bad and we just build a narrative that could or couldn’t have anything to do with our feelings. A good advice is, I think, when feeling bad; try to change how you spend your time and you can be surprised. Don’t trust too much in introspection.",1428926917

9367111,comment,9366219,9366945,0,0,toyg,,,"> In the average, it looks like that women seem to get energized in midlife whereas men seem to lose power.<p>Could this be natural, in a way? Women have always had to look after the wellbeing and social standing of their offspring, because their own survival derived from them more often than not. By 40, they either have teen-aged kids in their formative years, or they&#x27;re grandmothers; in both cases, they must be at full steam. This has not changed much in modern times, if anything it&#x27;s become easier to deal with (they are not going to starve if their children don&#x27;t work on the farm).<p>Men have a different set of &quot;natural&quot; expectations. Fighters by 40 were either dead or veterans with respected social status; agricultural workers would be phasing out, with children taking over some of their duties. This is very different now: a lot of men at 40 have average jobs that will expect the same level of performance day-in day-out, no &quot;phasing out&quot; allowed (especially in tight economic times) and no real social status either. It&#x27;s easy to feel dejected when looking back.",1428926525

I touch-type Colemak on hardware keyboards; for those who don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a layout optimized for fast and ergonomic typing in English (there are variants for some other languages), without being as different from QWERTY as Dvorak is. SwiftKey supports Colemak out of the box for English, so I tried it. I normally use SwiftKey Flow for writing long bits of text on my tablet.<p>My experience with Flow and Colemak was that the rate of errors was much higher -- there were far more ambiguities, mainly because many of the most common letters are on the home row (arst neio), and so you&#x27;re often just swiping back and forth across the home row, which could mean anything. You also end up having to swipe farther, because of more lateral movement from one end of the keyboard to the other, and less top-to-bottom movement.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in hearing the experiences of anyone who&#x27;s tried swiping on a Dvorak layout.<p>One final note, if anyone hasn&#x27;t seen MessageEase, they should check it out. It&#x27;s a compelely different model for typing that involves a very compact and optimized layout to minimize finger movement, as well as a mixture of tapping and swiping. If it had the benefit of SwiftKey&#x27;s language model, I&#x27;d use it for everything, but as it stands, I use it mainly where completion is not available (e.g. in terminal sessions).",1428926407

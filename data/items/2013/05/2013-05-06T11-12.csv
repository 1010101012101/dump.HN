I would start by identifying all the inputs and outputs of the system and correct undesired inputs one by one until the outputs reach their intended values.<p>I'm not particularly well versed in control theory, but I'd be willing to wager that one could use feedback loops to model the tricky bits of the human mind where one element (e.g. a particular neurotransmitter) could be considered either an input or an output.  Maybe it doesn't matter whether you treat the thoughts or the chemicals, because rather than one being cause and one being symptom, they're both elements in a feedback loop, and all you have to do is interrupt the loop.",1367840050

The problem is that synchronization is expensive: not only because of the memory barriers, which have to include the most expensive ones, but also because locking and unlocking operations need to access main memory directly, bypassing all caches.<p>The problem is, in any event, not the synchronization, but the common path -- for which double-checked locking tries to avoid synchronization --, which needs at a minimum a load-load barrier.

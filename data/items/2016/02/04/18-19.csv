11036233,comment,11034071,11034071,0,0,jad,,,"I think there are a few concrete things going on:<p>* There are many more integration points between their products now. Shipping only the Mac or only the Mac and an iPod or even a first gen iPhone that can only get data into system apps via a USB cable is very simple compared to what they&#x27;re making today. For Apple&#x27;s best-cast customer, who owns a Mac, an iPhone, an iPad, an Apple TV, an Apple Watch, and who uses iCloud, how many integration points are involved now? Integration points are like the exponent on software complexity. It&#x27;s where software goes to die.<p>* They are still essentially a fat client company that&#x27;s trying to build more cloud-oriented applications. This leads to additional complexity in the product that other companies just don&#x27;t have to deal with. An obvious example that jumps to mind is iTunes vs. Spotify. If iTunes was just Apple&#x27;s version of Spotify, how much better would it be?<p>* Brain drain. Apple&#x27;s stock made a lot of people a lot of money, and if you work there, you can&#x27;t participate in the mobile revolution they started. Steve Jobs&#x27;s passing could also be a natural book end for people in their careers to try something new, or find a job where they&#x27;re not working 80 hours regularly, or to just take some time off.<p>I guess the last one isn&#x27;t really &quot;concrete&quot;, and is more just me speculating, but I threw it out there because of a decent amount of anecdotal evidence I&#x27;ve seen. Here are some other things that are also just speculative but interesting to consider:<p>* Apple is a product company that succeeds or fails on innovation. As capable of an executive as Tim Cook clearly is, he&#x27;s not a product person. How does this trickle down into the product development process?<p>* Product development was micromanaged by Steve Jobs basically until he died. That leaves a HUGE vacuum in an organization and executive team he built to amplify his personal strengths and weaknesses. Who is filling that vacuum now? Is it Jony Ive? Does his new role of &quot;Chief Design Officer&quot; mean he&#x27;s kind of the new Steve Jobs, in charge of product design, retail stores, office space, etc.?<p>* If Jony Ive has the final say of all software still (not clear to me in this new role), how good is he at software? How interested is he in it personally? He clearly loves the physical design of things. Steve clearly loved software. If Jony is in charge, does he have that love as well? Does he devote the time and attention into the software as he does with the hardware? Or, to take the iTunes example again, is Eddy Cue basically in charge of that product?<p>* How good are the people there at software design without Steve? There&#x27;s a great story about Steve Jobs coming into an iDVD design meeting where he ignored what the team came up with and drew a window on a whiteboard with one area to drag files and one button that says &quot;burn&quot;.[1] Is that just one story? How important was that to the day-to-day of the products they shipped? Who does that now?<p>The key point to me is that, according to Steve himself, Apple is a software company.[2] They make hardware so they can make really great software. Software is what&#x27;s most important, and I hope stories like this are a bit of a wake up call to re-center their focus on what&#x27;s truly important.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dandemeyere.com/blog/5-most-inspiring-steve-jobs-stories"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dandemeyere.com/blog/5-most-inspiring-steve-jobs-stor...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEeyaAUCyZs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEeyaAUCyZs</a>",1454611990

You&#x27;re comparing something completely new, that&#x27;s barely started the transition from thought to physical reality, with technology that&#x27;s half a century old.<p>The Wright Flyer was slower than a contemporary ship, let alone a train, yet this technology quickly became the fastest transportation available.<p>Hyperloop is supposed to average about 600MPH and hit a top speed of 760MPH. Now, that&#x27;s a far-off estimate of something totally unproven and could be way off, but if you&#x27;re going to compare it to alternatives you need to compare what it will become, not what it currently is. You might disagree on what it could become (I have no idea how much of the supposed specs are feasible and how much is just wishful thinking, and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me at all if it couldn&#x27;t achieve its goals) but you can&#x27;t just look at some first-try barely-works prototype and assume that&#x27;s the end state.",1454610500

I was excited to read about some scientific breakthrough because I saw the link from Hacker News, but this one crucial fact gave it away:<p>> the McMaster researchers rounded up 40 overweight young men<p>Of course they both lost weight and gained muscle. They were overweight to begin with. Anyone overweight who starts exercising loses a lot of weight and gains muscle simply because their bodies began to have higher caloric expenditures, and their muscles had to adapt to more mechanical stresses.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about someone whose body fat percentage is already normal, however, we&#x27;ll go back to choosing between losing weight or gaining muscle, because you can&#x27;t do both. When you exercise, you burn the carbs first, then the fat, then to a small extent, the protein, though these three are being used simultaneously to produce energy. You hit the fat-burning zone when your carbs can&#x27;t produce as much energy (fat produces way more energy but requires way more intensity to burn), but since fat also takes some time to burn and you already need to produce energy to continue with the exercise, you use the protein too, which comes from your muscles.<p>This is the reason why bodybuilders have a cutting phase and a gaining phase. They gain muscle or strength for 2-5 months, cut for 1-2 months, then go back to gaining muscle again. How do you gain muscle? You put on weight--meaning, you eat more. The weight that you put on will be about 5 parts fat and 1 part muscle, and that is why the cutting phase is necessary. Muscle is only gained with the fat and continued weight training, so burn the fat once you put on the weight. Whenever you attempt to lose fat, you will always inevitably lose muscle, so if you want to get buff, you can only do so much fat-burning exercises. That means keeping your runs at 10-15km, for example.<p>In summary, you can&#x27;t do both. You can only gain muscle and lose weight together if you&#x27;re really fat to begin with. If you&#x27;re within the average body fat % range, though, you still need to switch between cutting and gaining phases.",1454609876

Yet, they actually <i>do</i> have an effect that ranges from undetectable leaks to failures of the system from components made faulty due to long exposure. In later case, users not aware of attacks believe the components were faulty for other reasons. Here&#x27;s a nice timeline on the leak side:<p><a href=""https://cryptome.org/0001/tempest-time.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cryptome.org/0001/tempest-time.htm</a><p>Matter of fact, they banned cellphones in secure facilities because bringing certain ones within 20 or so ft of a secure phone compromised it. The background radiation of the phone bounced off the inside of the chip in a way that was modified by the circuits holding the master key. What bounced out could be caught, analyzed, and keys re-assembled. All conversations compromised without anyone ever knowing. Just because you walked in with a cellphone on your waste.<p>But, &quot;nobody really reports these [compromises] when holding a transmitting cell phone near their [computer].&quot;<p>;) What do you think of that parallel? Something to it possibly or just a fun thought experiment?",1454609620

It could, and I think <i>should</i>, have been worded differently if the intent was to probe whether you were being hyperbolic or mistaken. E.g.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure how someone would go about not using any Apple app, such as calculator, camera, clock, contacts, messages, phone, photos, safari.  Do you not require a lot of what these apps provide, or have actually found good alternatives for each of them?&quot;<p>or<p>&quot;I really can&#x27;t imagine not using any Apple apps.  How do you get by without <i>any</i> of them?&quot;<p>In each of these cases, the problem is presented as a failure of the asker&#x27;s imagination or knowledge, and we ask for clarification on this point.  IMO, this is a much more civil way to converse than starting out by questioning the veracity of someone&#x27;s statements about <i>theirself</i>.",1454608886

It&#x27;s on some banks balance sheets and so it&#x27;s loaned out, then repackaged and sold to organizations seeking safe places to park money.  This repackaging of debt has been a huge boon to the US economy in the short term.  But, it&#x27;s only a long term gain if people actually default otherwise it&#x27;s just a long term drain for a short term boon.<p>The wider problem is there is more &#x27;money&#x27; than productive usage for that money which means bad loans, and wealth destruction.  Arguably the solution is to have money sit around without being loaned out.",1454608863

Most sites aren&#x27;t implementing something like Google Earth, which needs heavy machinery to make it go. They&#x27;re not implementing a multiplayer game in the browser. They&#x27;re not using WebGL to display and edit 3D engineering drawings.  90% of web pages just display some static text and images with some forms and buttons, just like they did 10 years ago.

Nearly a decade ago I started work on a project. For eight years progress consisted of taking notes and daydreaming. I was going to write a book that would make me famous. Over the years the dream-ideas progressed from a paper book, to an iPod book, to a HTML5 book. The daydreams always kept up with the available technology. Finally, two years ago, I suddenly started working on the thing. It is a travelogue, written for Android. The difficulties of implementation were unexpected and surprising. And now that it&#x27;s approaching completeness a new set of unexpected problems arise. I&#x27;d assumed that simply writing a book would be enough to sell it; but apparently a lot of marketing is required. Daydreaming has benefits, but it costs time.<p>Edit: Having mentioned marketing; here is video screen cap of the book: <a href=""https://youtu.be/yX4JTS-eIqQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/yX4JTS-eIqQ</a>",1454608849

It would be expected that a long-term investor would have a negative alpha (for the period of a few seconds), especially in a shallow market encouraged by low-latency traders.<p>For example, if you&#x27;re buying 100k stocks on an exchange, chances are that you&#x27;ll move the price. Since the price movement was &quot;random&quot; (i.e. not caused by any fundamental news about the company, but rather about your decision to execute that trade exactly in that moment), it would make sense for the price to revert back to the previous mean. But then, if you&#x27;re focused on the long-term performance of your investments, you won&#x27;t care - you <i>know</i> in advance that you will have to pay a fee for executing large trades (which is only fair, really), so you factor that in when deciding which stock to buy!",1454608826

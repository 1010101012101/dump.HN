2955766,comment,2954810,2955700,1,0,redsymbol,,,"Thanks for explaining. I guess it's hard for me to think of these things in isolation.  Tax revenue is one factor in the equation; employment levels are another.<p>One thing the state presumably would like to do with the tax revenue is promote job creation.  Having 7,000 extra jobs available would bring all sorts of great benefits to California - some of which are easy to quantify, and some of which aren't.<p>The whole situation reminds me of a little skirmish recently between the San Francisco board of supervisors, and Twitter. Twitter was willing to move its main offices to a slightly run-down section of San Francisco in exchange for some city tax breaks; otherwise, they'd relocate to (I think) Burlingame instead.  Twitter was going to have those jobs SOMEWHERE; the only question was whether it was going to be in SF, or somewhere else.  And it didn't make economic sense for them to set up shop in SF without the tax breaks.<p>Providing jobs in an area, as well as the local business benefits of those people spending their salary in that location, was expected to bring enough benefit that the tax breaks were given, and Twitter decided to stay [0].  A lot of people were howling about corporate subsidies, though.<p>This whole subject is near and dear to my heart.  One primary goal with my own startup is to create jobs that help financially support people and their families.<p>And on that note, back to work ;)<p>[0] <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2011/04/22/twitter-san-francisco/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2011/04/22/twitter-san-francisco/</a>",1315000788

I'm saying there was some non-zero probability that it was in the specified energy range before, and given these results the probability that it's now in that range is now 5% of the value it was before. Or more precisely, the probability that we're in the universe where the Higgs is in the specified energy range and it's detectable with this experiment just went down to 5% of it's original value. Even if we can't accurately identify what the value of the probability is, we can still say it went down to 5% of its original value on the basis of the evidence from this experiment. I would also argue that prior to this experiment the probability of the Higgs appearing in this energy range given our state of evidence of how the universe works was significant (more than 15% I'd say) otherwise we wouldn't have built the LHC. I understand you can't say this with a frequentist approach because we don't have a sample of universes to draw on to estimate priors.<p>Finally we're not talking about the probability of some state of the universe in the absolute (as frequentists claim, we can't meaningfully talk about such things), we're talking about some state of the universe given the evidence we have.",1314999953

2955726,comment,2955472,2955641,6,0,joebadmo,,,"Creation is much easier today, it's true. And for a while, it looked like the old model of a few rich broadcasting/production companies making things for the rest of us to sit at home and passivel consume was going away, replaced by a model where we all have the means to produce better and better stuff, where merit, originality, expressiveness, communication were rewarded more than the means to invest the necessary capital. It looked like livejournal, flickr, deviantart - the blogging revolution - was empowering a generation to turn off the television and engage in an active, participatory way in a global conversation.<p>Not that passive consumption is inherently evil. I just was imagining a world where the power of creation is more evenly distributed. I'm a little sad to see that trend start to reverse.<p>I agree that creation isn't for everyone. But the available tools have an effect. They encourage or discourage in subtle ways. The iPad's software keyboard imposes just a slight amount of friction on inputting text. That has an effect. It matters, to some however small degree, and it aggregates with every other way that Apple optimizes consumption over production.<p>On centralized authority: again, the way you are consuming content is not the case Apple is optimizing for. They have allowed it, but their most sanctioned way is for you to buy content from their partners through their distribution channels. It's not a complete restriction, but an optimization of a certain model through UI. TFA's description of the new Kindle seems to follow, and, indeed, to go farther down this path.<p>Meta: Not that I'm particularly offended, but why take such an abrasive tone? ""Central authority bullshit,"" ""obvious nonsense""? Do you simply not consider it a possibility that you didn't fully understand what I was trying to say, either because I communicated it poorly or because it doesn't align with your preconceived notions? I'm actually quite happy to be having this discussion, as it's one I've tried to have many times, but never got much uptake. But, why start with such a dismissive tone? I've seen so many threads start with mild, mutual abrasiveness and spiral quickly into full-out flamewar. Why take a step down that path? Is it so hard to be overtly civil?

2955725,comment,2955472,2955634,5,0,9999,,,"In terms of desktop publishing you might be right, but I think we've seen amazing strides in the realms of audio and video production in the past ten years.  It's now possible to buy cameras and audio recording gear for pennies on the dollar of what you used to pay for tools with similar capabilities.  Meanwhile the software side of things has advanced just as rapidly...  For example, I had to do some noise reduction on some audio recordings a couple of weeks ago and what used to take hours to do in early iterations of Protools now only takes a few clicks in Adobe's Audition (and probably in the latest version of protools too...).  Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash...  All of these tools have advanced considerably in the last few years, much less the last decade.<p>Tablets have any number of interesting productivity software being developed for them (innovative word processors spring immediately to mind), but developers are severely limited by the hardware capabilities of those platforms...

Is your code bug free? How do you recover?<p>IMHO, you're making a pretty big assumption here anyway with the fixed queue depth. The idea with a message queue is that it delegates the responsibility of ensuring message delivery to another component, so that enqueues always work, and that messages always get delivered. Perhaps it's ok in your use case that some tasks fail to get delivered, but I'd prefer not to voluntarily give that up for some reason that I may have missed from the original post. In the linked .NET example, they used capped collections because it was a chatty message bus, not a worker queue, and guaranteed message delivery wasn't important. I've nearly filled the drives up on a RabbitMQ box with messages and it was still able to insert and pop them off at thousands per second, with full durability and persistence.<p>Celery can read and write JSON to a multitude of backends. Last time I checked, both Ruby and JavaScript have pretty solid JSON support. DaemonKit on Ruby supports building a robust worker pool over AMQP.<p>Every wheel reinvented is also conceptual and maintenance overhead, and I'd argue that, most of the time, is probably far worse than writing tools from scratch. There's a highly likelihood reinvention will introduce a bug or poorly-handled ""edge"" case in a from-scratch tool than if an existing, mature tool is used. When ""bad things happen,"" a mature tool will give ""a way out"" that a custom tool probably won't have. Much like the honey badger, when scale and disaster strikes, it simply does not give a shit about how minimalistic your stack is.

That's a big stick, and one routinely used by real cops (i.e., it was reasonable of him to believe they'd retaliate unfairly if he asserted his rights).  I don't blame him for complying under the circumstances, even though it's outrageous that he was asked to (whether they were fake cops or not).",1314997248

The machine I'm using doesn't show that many bugs. I'm patient with bugs - they'll fix them, they fixed them in the older release. It's not that.<p>The bar side is OK-to-mediocre but the lack of a main-menu/start-menu completely crocks the thing. WTF. I can't find my apps, the apps I have installed. I've looked quite a bit. WTF were they thinking? Their particular search thingy sucks but that's not the point - even if it was great, I'd <i>also</i> need to know the stuff that is ""just there"". Sure, maybe I am an idiot for not knowing the names of the obscure graphics program I just installed and want to use but I don't think I'm the only idiot with this problem and other interfaces are forgiving for us idiots.<p>It seems like there are two kinds of users that wouldn't be bothered by Unity. Those who only use the browser or about two-three GUIs and those who only use the command line.<p>For all I know, these might a majority but as a former Windows power user, I suspect that there's an important minority of Ubuntu users and potential Ubuntu who'd like to use a wide variety the existing Linux GUI. Ubuntu has essentially excluded us.<p>And its not just that Windows/GUI ""power users"" are a fair share of Ubuntu users but that I think we'd be the best ambassadors/evangelists if Ubuntu is to get off the ground - those who use the OS as only a launchpad to start a browser won't have a strong opinion and the average person isn't going emulate those ten terminals to get their work done.<p>I can see the ""everything slightly confusing must be destroyed"" ethos leading to an ""OS"" consisting of a brightly color candy-machine interface with two buttons,  ""browser"" and ""off"". No one will be confused but it will still suck.",1314997227

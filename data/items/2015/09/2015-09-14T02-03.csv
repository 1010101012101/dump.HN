10213494,comment,10211153,10213292,0,0,arm,,,"Symbola certainly does support most of the characters used in that article (not all though). Specifically, it doesn’t have glyphs for the CJK characters or the regional indicator symbols used on the page, so you’ll need another font for those. (OS X v10.7+ includes the &#x27;Apple Color Emoji&#x27; font which has glyphs for the regional indicator symbols, while on Windows 7, &#x27;Segoe UI Symbol&#x27; includes glyphs for them (you need to have installed the update¹ for the font first though)).<p>Anyways, firstly, there’s no need to uncheck &#x27;Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of my selections above&#x27;. You can go ahead and let the page specify whatever fonts it wants. If you don’t have the font(s) specified in the webpage’s stylesheet, or the webpage contains a character that the current font doesn’t have a glyph for, your OS/browser will substitute it for another font on your system that does have a glyph for that character (if it exists), so you can recheck that option. In fact, you don’t have to explicitly even pick Symbola to be used as a font for any type of text in Firefox at all, since your OS should use font substitution automatically if any of those fonts chosen there don’t have a glyph for a character on whatever webpage you’re on. In fact, to begin with, it’s impossible for any one font to contain all of Unicode right now, since even OpenType fonts can only contain a maximum of 65,536 glyphs, while Unicode has more than 120,000 assigned codepoints, so font substitution is absolutely necessary (so you can change the fonts in Firefox back to the defaults if you like).<p>Secondly, after you install the font, you may have to restart the computer or close Firefox before it actually picks up on the new font.<p>Thirdly, the version of Symbola that was linked to in the article is an old one. I’d recommend this² one instead (covers more codepoints).<p>――――――<p>¹ — <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2729094"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2729094</a><p>² — <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150625020428/http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20150625020428/http://users.teil...</a>",1442199512

Having short commits is better than long commits, but not at the expense of information. I don&#x27;t need commits that use the words &quot;updated, fixed, added&quot; -- if I&#x27;m looking at `blame` I know something was updated/fixed/added. What matters is how something was changed, and sometimes why it was changed.<p>Write commits that help your coworkers figure out why the code looks the way it does. If you&#x27;re writing &quot;update FooBarFactory to fix Bug4&quot; you&#x27;re essentially wasting my time by using git to narrate the obvious.",1442199466

10213470,comment,10212770,10213186,0,0,mikekchar,,,"My bluez problem may be related to using a Microsoft Sculpt keyboard.  Was running Gentoo for many years on one of my boxes with the same bluetooth issues.  Mainly bluez works fine if the device doesn&#x27;t shut down for power saving.  If it does, then bluez will often refuse to reconnect to it.  I&#x27;ve tried to debug it but the code is not the most friendly ;-)  It seems that the agent gets in a bad state where it thinks the device is both simultaneously connected and not connected.  The easiest way to solve the problem is to restart the bluetooth service, reinitialize the agent and then hit a key on the keyboard.  Doing <i>anything</i> else will cause it to get in the same bad state again.  Occasionally you have to remove the device and re-pair.<p>Every third update it will just start working and I&#x27;ll think &quot;Oh they fixed the bug&quot;.  Then the next update breaks it again.  I don&#x27;t doubt that bluez <i>must</i> work well for some hardware, but for mine it is practically black magic to get it working.<p>My only point in fingering bluez is to say that bluetooth going down is not a surprising event on my machine and isn&#x27;t related to systemd at all.  I suspect the same is true of the OP&#x27;s box.  It was probably just a coincidence that bluetooth died at the same time that systemd was installed.",1442198520

If you take a majority-white population and distribute employees completely at random then you would expect to see several companies that are entirely or almost entirely white, because random is not the same thing as uniform. And then there are several benign things that tend to create clusters, like geography. (There is a lower proportion of Asians local to Boston than San Francisco etc.)<p>Diversity doesn&#x27;t mean every company has every group in exactly the same proportion as the general population. That isn&#x27;t diversity, it&#x27;s uniformity. The only way you get that level of uniformity is authoritarian decree. Diversity is <i>so much messier than that</i> because natural diversity is a derivative of Darwinian forces. It doesn&#x27;t care about made up unscientific nonsense like race, so the distribution of &quot;races&quot; in a completely egalitarian society is not uniform, it&#x27;s completely arbitrary.<p>> In my experience most people who point at the pipeline problem are lazy.<p>Probably most people who point at the pipeline problem can see it plainly but don&#x27;t know how to fix it.

There is no single thing that causes it and no organization responsible for it. So it&#x27;s easy to point to it, <i>because it&#x27;s real</i>, but how do you fix it?

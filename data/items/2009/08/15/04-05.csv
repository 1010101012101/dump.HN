As. The. Engine. Of. Application. State."" (or HATEOAS, one of the main principles of REST) is that your application should never have to guess a URL. The possible URLs your application can next GET/POST/PUT/DELETE to should be given in the response to the last action it took.<p>There is nothing in the original description of REST that says anything about URLs being human readable. That's a pleasant side-effect of a sensible design but isn't the main aim.<p>As the original post describes, the importance of REST is to make simpler for machines (not humans) to manipulate services on the web.<p>You should probably read a bit more about the principles of REST before confusing people with your own interpretation of what you think it is.<p>edit: mistakenly thought HN understood markdown.\nedit: mistakenly thought HN understood HTML.",1250311296

Not all of it will be, though.  But if someone can make some money convincing people that it is, then someone will.  That's just the market.<p>Actually, I think people <i>should</i> go by taste.

In the U.S., that baby will be treated and damn the cost.  In most other countries, that baby will be scored as a miscarriage (i.e. not the hospital's fault) if it dies.

But still the idea of open source is that everyone is free to use <i>everything</i> so that if someone sees something done better they can incorporate it into their own project right? They don't have to copy and paste stuff, but they can take the concept, idea, etc. If they don't and can't get over their investment, then they are doomed to failure eventually because those who <i>do</i> take the best stuff out there and build on top of it will have a technical advantage.<p>So Firefox and safari are publicly contributed to, but they have different engines. Engines are probably the most difficult part of the browser right? It's essentially the definition of the browser. Well let's say the V8 engine is superior and Firefox and safari don't adopt it. Well they're operating not much too different from a proprietary source. Open source and commercial will both be invested in their products, the difference is that open source can pull from each other, and they should. So if V8 requires major code changes why not? And if Mozilla thinks it can improve it then they can fork it. But Mozilla probably won't do that. You're right most people are invested in their projects and so what happens in the open source world is that brand new projects get started instead, but I'm just saying it also makes sense to ditch when you known you've been beaten just because you can.",1250309465

For the betterment of his nation, he engaged in a huge campaign to popularize the eating of polished (white) rice.  He did this because white rice is much easier to store for longer periods, and more conducive to warehousing and other logistical activities.

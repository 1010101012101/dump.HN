1062691,comment,1062494,1062494,0,0,zzzmarcus,,,"I stopped using Yelp and uninstalled it from my iPhone when I read the article last year.<p>Yelp's business model doesn't sit well with me. Even if the allegations of good reviews disappearing for businesses who don't pay up aren't true, the idea that there is a service out there that you don't want but you're almost forced into paying for since it's affecting your business directly feels to me like paying the mafia to 'protect' your business.<p>If Yelp really does want to help both businesses and consumers, give businesses the ability to respond to reviews for free and don't artificially alter results, be like Google and let your algorithm work. Make money selling ads.<p>It reminds me of the whole GetSatisfaction drama with 37 Signals from a few months ago (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=540540"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=540540</a>). This type of business model where you provide a business a ""service"" they didn't ask for then try to charge them for it will never go over well.<p>[Edit] FWIW this page, found below in relme's comment (<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/myths"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/myths</a>) directly answers every one of my concerns with Yelp. If it's true then great, sounds like they're doing things well. I find it hard to write off all the complaints as fictional though.",1263923889

Numerical Recipes has a great section on this, IIRC.<p>But that kind of obscures the fact that, while algorithms like LU decomposition are faster than a pure matrix inversion, they're faster by a constant factor of about 2 or so.  It's not a fundamentally different algorithm, just a different set of tricks to solve a bunch of simultaneous equations.  If you aren't hugely performance constrained and already have a matrix inversion routine, you'd never be bothered to re-write your equation solver just for this speedup.",1263923782

By attacking the QWERTY example, the authors are attacking the case for government intervention.<p>> Stanford University economist Paul Krugman offered the central claim of this literature boldly and with admirable simplicity: ""In QWERTY worlds, markets can't be trusted."" The reason that he uses ""QWERTY worlds,"" and not DOS worlds, or VHS worlds, is that the DOS and VHS examples are not very compelling. Almost no one uses DOS anymore, and many video recorder purchasers thought VHS was better than Beta (as it was, in terms of recording time, as we have discussed at length elsewhere).<p>In an argument about government intervention, the burden of proof should always be on those arguing for government intervention because they are arguing that freedom should be restricted. To take a simple example, if you publish something on the Internet and I want the government to force you to take it down, the burden should be on me to show why the government should interfere with you. If I don't make a case that is more convincing than yours, you should be left alone. I should not be allowed to require that you prove why you should be allowed to publish.<p>This is an important distinction because freedom often depends on this. Many activities that free people engage in would not happen if people had to ask permission first-- either because there is no plausible reason why the particular activity should be allowed, or just because it would not be worth the trouble.<p>In a free society, government must have a good reason to prohibit. In a non-free society, people must have a good reason to get permission. The authors are assuming a free society, so they content themselves with attacking government's reasons to prohibit.",1263922360

I would rather try to do something hard and fail than set out to do something easy and succeed.  Also, often failing at something hard will result in something short of your goal but still far better than you would have gotten by going for the easy goal.<p>Second, it is very hard to know what your means or someone elses means are, or even what is possible.  A great many things that people used to think were impossible have been achieved.<p>And finally:<p><i>They will have very ambitious goals and will not settle for what they consider beneath them.</i><p>First, most people will eventually settle if they hit repeated failure (but perhaps settle for more than they would have gotten by aiming low...).  I know one person who dreamed of acting and is now programming, whether this is ""settling"" is debatable, but it wasn't their stated goal.  If a person truly refuses to settle, then they have a couple of choices:<p>1. They can refuse to give up and keep trying without end.  This can be good.  They may eventually succeed, and even if they won't, they will probably get further than they would by settling.<p>2. They can try to cheat and use unethical means to get what they want.  But the answer to this one is not to make them less ambitious, but to help make the children more moral so they will never resort to this and stick with #1.<p>3. They can give up in some extreme way such as living on welfare or ending their own life.  But I don't think many ambitious people will take this route, and again the answer is not make the children less ambitous but to make them more moral and more stable so they would stick with #1.<p>In short, I think it is a very good idea to encourage children to be ambitious and work to improve themselves.",1263921741

Generally speaking, I think it's wrong for others to force you to be charitable (in the very least, a tax break would be nice if it's about charity) but immigration shouldn't be and isn't about charity.<p>In fact, most studies point to the positive economic impacts of immigration over time (though there are a number of studies that also point to the short term costs).",1263921196

The problem is that, while you can switch to using vi keybindings for primary editing, every other single package will use conventional Emacs keybindings.<p>Thing is, I don't want to add yet another layer on top of either Emacs (!!!) or vim. Both have waaaaay too much cruft as-is. (nvi isn't as bad.) I think the buffers-and-modes extension model in Emacs and vi's modal, primarily single-key interface are good ideas, though, and I don't see any reason why they couldn't be combined.

At some point, I think we're going a lot further down than just one point on the scale.<p>Right now, this reality is reflected in our (remarkably badly run) immigration system, where the United States takes about 1.2 million immigrants legally into the country every year, by far the most in absolutes and high up there in percentage of population, but still faces a surprising amount of criticism for being anti-immigrant because we don't take in even more.

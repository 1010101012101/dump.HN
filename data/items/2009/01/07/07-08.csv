423162,comment,423119,423119,0,0,makecheck,,,"I am most curious about GNUstep (gnustep.org).  GNUstep is similar to the Window Maker window manager on Linux, like Cocoa uses Aqua on Mac OS X.  From what I've seen, GNUstep and Cocoa are very similar (both Objective-C, both using the original NS* classes, etc.) and the project aims to remain compatible with Cocoa where possible.  I've used both Window Maker and Aqua, and I like both GUI styles.<p>Apparently GNUstep is usable on Windows, but I've never tried it.<p>At least in theory, the same Cocoa-like source could be used for a GUI app on all 3 major platforms.<p>Objective-C isn't as simple as C, but it's pretty simple, and fully compatible with C.  It's also been bound to every major scripting language I can think of.",1231314972

423160,comment,423069,423069,0,0,mbreese,,,"I think that he missed one big problem he had... timing.  All of the ideas that he listed, based upon the dates he gives, were well ahead of their time.  Meaning, while they were technically possible, there was no market for them, or the scale wasn't there.<p>For example, he lists a CCTV DVR in 1997.  There simply wasn't a market for DVRs in 1997.  DVDs were just coming out then, and most people had VCRs.  If you wanted to break into the video recording market, you had to unseat the VCR.  Good luck with that.  Then on top of that, hard drives cost many times more than they do now ($/GB), so in order to have any sort of usable hard drive space, you would effectively price yourself out of the consumer market.  Now, fast forward a couple of years, and you suddenly have a lot of people without VCRs who would like to record shows and lower hard drive costs.  The market was primed for a TiVo to show up (actually, I'd argue that TiVo was still a little early and just barely survived, but that's my unfounded opinion).<p>Of course, the other major problem that he alludes to was that a lot of his technology was designed for the adult industry, which may be somewhat difficult to put on a resume or get investors to take seriously.",1231314794

The cost structure for any manufacturing company that relies on labor is too high for any margin of competition due to current laws.<p>If the dollar dies, especially if doing so removes its status as a reserve currency for much of the world's economies, the US economy/nation-state will be in for a long time of restructuring.<p>The only part of the economy I see any potential real growth is the creative sector.

423119,story,,,28,55,moder,"Ask HN: An acceptable cross-platform GUI toolkit?",,"It's interesting but disappointing that there's no standout ""winner"" among desktop GUI toolkits. Among other things, devs want to write software that runs on their favorite GNU/Linux distribution, but that also runs nicely and is easily installed on MS Windows and Mac OS X. Here are the arguments I hear against some current popular toolkits:<p>* GTK+ -- Has lots of moving parts. Difficult to build/install on MS Windows. Some say it's too closely tied to X11. Doesn't look enough like MS Windows on MS Windows. The LGPL licensing is very successful though, as demonstrated by the fairly large developer community and by its use in Gnome.<p>* Qt -- Either GPL your software or pay the licensing fees. Also some don't like having to deal with C++ if you're required to ever look under the hood. Nice that it comes in one big piece though.<p>* Tk -- Some have referred to Tk as a vistigial GUI appendage from a bygone era. Also it depends upon Tk. This one would be a hard sell to get everyone to agree on.<p>* wxWidgets -- Complaints are that it looks too much like the MS Windows API, and also that it's too big (being a wrapper around lower-level GUI toolkits).<p>It would seem that we (the free software community) should just bite the bullet, list out the basic requirements for a successful GUI toolkit, and go ahead and create it. I'd dare say that the requirements might look like this:<p>* Written in C. C is fast, portable, and everyone knows it. Corollary: keep it simple (like Tk) and packaged in one piece (like Qt). Having a half dozen different pieces all bolted together (like GTK+) in the name of modularity only makes it harder to create easily-distributable cross-platform apps. 2nd corollary: be careful not to tie it too closely to X11.<p>* Keep it simple so it's easy to port to Windows and Mac OS X (Cocoa). Corollary: simple and easy to <i>build</i> too.<p>* LGPL licensed. Most camps can probably (at least grudgingly) come to agreement on this, and it's worked pretty well for GTK+. Works for free software and for commercial apps, and tends to build nice communities.<p>* Can easily be made to look like MS Windows on MS Windows, and Aqua on Mac OS X. I really don't care if it's themable or not, but for wide adoption, it had at least better be able to easily make itself look like MS Windows and Aqua.<p>* Easy to make bindings for Python, Ruby, Perl, etc. I <i>really</i> do not want to write GUI apps in C, but I don't want it so fancy that you have to do acrobatics to mate, say, Python, to it.<p>* Simple and easy to use (like Tk).<p>Anyone working on or know of that cross-platform GUI toolkit? Because <i>that's</i> the one I want to use, and I bet it's the one a <i>lot</i> of devs would also want to use.",1231312002

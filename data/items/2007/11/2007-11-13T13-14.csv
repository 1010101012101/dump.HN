79216,comment,79210,79210,0,0,cperciva,,,"YC can get away with providing such small amounts of seed funding because of the nature of the companies and founders they fund -- companies with almost zero capital costs and no marginal cost of product, and founders who are willing to work for equity.<p>The DHS Skunkworks funds projects which require significant capital costs and are expensive to scale up -- and because the government doesn't want to end up paying market rates for the product of R&D they funded, they have to pay their ""founders"" with cash instead of equity.<p>The YC model works fine when applied to the right fields, but notion that YC's success can be replicated in completely different fields is downright silly.",1194962349

79213,comment,79083,79083,0,0,brlewis,,,"When you're thinking hypothetically about incorporating in the future, YC is a great place to get feedback.  When you have multiple founders, and you're about to launch, and provide paid services, you should be asking different questions.  Where do I find a good lawyer?   How much should I expect to pay?

This is good news for me, because integrating Snipshot with ourdoings.com is in my plans, and I wouldn't want them to disappear.  That they recently added a Pro version seems a good sign.

79196,comment,79077,79077,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"This doesn't surprise me.  I'm in a different part of Europe that's getting the iPhone in a few days, and I won't be rushing out to buy it.  Sure, it looks like a nice piece of kit, but if I'm going to upgrade from my RAZR...<p>1. 3G please.   Since the iPhone is expensive I expect it to be able to act as a decent modem for my MacBook Pro when I'm on the road.  EDGE has a theoretical top speed of 200Kbps, but is more like 90Kbps in practice.  Whereas I can go out and get a 3G+ (up to 36Mbps) modem for my computer for 9 EUR plus a contract.  <p>2. Poor camera at price point.  The Nokia N95 is similarly priced but has a much better camera (5 megapixel with a Zeiss lens and a flash).<p>3. While we're on the topic of the similarly priced N95 it also has GPS and is 3G+ and EDGE so satisfies point #1. And it has WiFi.    The N95 probably loses on the screen and the ""Apple experience"" of very well integrated applications.  Also, it's kind of ugly.<p>4. Non-interchangeable battery.  This is a big deal for anyone like me who travels a lot.<p>So the iPhone looks expensive, nicely packaged, but not compelling.   I'll wait for v2.<p>John.

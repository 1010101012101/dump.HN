From your site:<p><pre><code>  ""Usually $11,000 + $3000 per founder. So $17,000 for two\n   founders, $20,000 for three or more. Occasionally we\n   invest more. The goal is usually to give you enough \n   money to build an impressive prototype or version 1, \n   which you can then use to get further funding.""\n</code></pre>\nA real hardware startup would require at least an order of magnitude more money than this.  Unless they walk in with all the required tools, you could burn $20K just in software licenses (Solidworks, Altium Designer, Xilinx Foundation, Keil, etc.) and not have much left for other stuff.  Heck, my DSO alone cost me about $20K.  The computer I am typing this on probably has $50K in hardware and licenses on it.<p>I could personally consider the idea of presenting a hardware startup to YC, but I would need to know that this is not about (with the utmost respect) finding a few starving 20-year-olds that will kill themselves for a $20K investment.  From my vantage point, if you are not throwing $250K+ into a hardware startup it just isn't going to happen.  Of course there are exceptions to every rule.  Then again, this ain't my first rodeo.<p>Now, if the idea is to throw some money at a project to cobble-together a smoke-and-mirrors prototype and then go raise a few million, well, for the right project this could work.<p>Again, I say the above with respect for what you do.  I have done a lot of hardware/software/multidisciplinary development.  It's very different from pure software web/mobile startups.  Very different.",1351036785

The streaming speed of modern tape drives is comparable to hard drives, so striping isn't that useful anyway (and one a single tape with tapes switched out, you'd lose the physical parallelism that makes striping useful). But <i>seek time</i> is what really kills tape drives, and that would benefit from mirroring (like RAID 0), which is what brudgers was suggesting.<p>Although brudgers talked about writing at different offsets, that's actually pointless if you don't rewind each tape between accesses (and why would you?). Assuming random access patterns, your read speed on the array will, on average, increase linearly with the number of tapes. This will come at the cost of write latency, the magnitude of the cost depending on how you implement the array.<p>If the array has independent <i>drives</i> (which would be very expensive, but let's assume for the moment), then your write latency is always dependent on the longest seek (you have to wait for the write to occur on every tape). That means that as the number of tapes increases, your average writing latency will approach the worst case for a single tape. In other words, with an infinite number of full drives, you would always have to wait for one of the drives to seek across an entire tape. That's pretty bad news, but it's acceptable for some cases.<p>On the other hand, if you had one drive and a tape library, your write times would really be completely unacceptable. Your linear read seek speed increase would come at the cost of a linear write seek <i>time</i> increase, <i>plus</i> a linear increase in writing throughput time.",1351034751

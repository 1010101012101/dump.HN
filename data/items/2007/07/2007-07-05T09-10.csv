Therefore I don't understand the pathological cheapness described in points 1-7. $150 for a cab, but renting a SHARED studio apartment? The supermarket is expensive but Quiznos and $2 tea at Starbucks? If Safeway is expensive the author is getting the worst compensation deal in the history of Sequoia backed startups...<p>The part about bikes is weird. Bike stores don't sell a lot of $3000 bikes. Well, maybe in Menlo Park they do. There  are a lot of price points in between an $80 walmart junker and a $3000 Colagno. I've owned many bikes throughout the years and never paid $3000 (or $80.) <p>The final point about office space is bizarre and I am calling bullshit. No startup in the history of Silicon Valley has started a ""bidding war"" between VCs for free office space. The paragraph doesn't even make sense. ",1183626703

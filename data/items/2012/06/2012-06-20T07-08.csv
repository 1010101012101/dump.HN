Sure if jwz want's to punish his user's I guess that's his prerogative but it seems like a good decision to provide an API that discourages bad practices.<p>Basically they decided to get rid of the cruft. OpenGL 1.x was designed in 1992? GPUs fundamentally changed in the mid 2000s and the decisions made for OpenGL 1.x no longer fit.<p>If you want 1.1 go contribute to this project.

Houses which are built nowadays are nearly passive house and this by law. Also, the German bank for development is giving everybody around 100k loan at about 1% to improve the energy efficiency of old and new houses.<p>Germans are extremely serious about energy use and savings and they know how to do an energy balance.

As soon as you start having real doubts about the performance or fitness of an employee, have at least two meetings with them to discuss the issues and create improvement plans and actions, before resorting to firing them. Those meetings are hard to approach correctly, but not as hard as actually firing the person, so please do not wait to have them, and make the most out of them.

I disagree. C is very simple. You need to know C is not suppoused to work the same on platform and I guess behaviour you have tested is not defined by standard. I think every good C programmer know when he have to be causious because behaviour may be platform dependent. In matter of fact you did as well. I guess case you've studdied is not common to be used in real code. If so, there is very easy solution:<p><pre><code>  #if ((char)CHAR_MAX) + 1 > ((char)CHAR_MAX)

4135946,comment,4134211,4134211,1,0,drostie,,,"Well, saying that it's ""compressing as it falls"" doesn't quite explain the observation either. What you see is the original slinky with a sudden catastrophic ""sound wave"" at the top propagating across it. It doesn't look like the whole slinky is contracting as it falls.<p>It's important to understand that as you hold it, each part of the slinky exists in a condition of equilibrium: since it is not accelerating upward or downward, the force of gravity and the force of the spring above pulling the slinky up must exactly cancel. If you slice the Slinky up into different ""chunks"" as a function of height, each chunk (call it dm) has the relationship (up-force) - (down-force) = g dm. It only connects to the parts immediately above and below it, and only moves when those parts move.<p>So actually, as long as that bottom part remains stretched just the way it is, the bottom edge cannot go up or down; the tension up top is the same as the tension on the bottom.<p>With a little more reflection, the stretching changes <i>must</i> propagate at the speed of sound in the slinky. That's just what sound is -- changes of pressure (in this case, tension) propagating through the solid. If you could send this sort of information faster, then sound would propagate faster commensurately. The speed of sound is fundamentally thus seen to be a connection, for the spring force, between ""wiggle this side over here"" and ""that side wiggles.""<p>Now, there are other forces at play in the slinky in theory which can propagate much faster: I imagine that a sound wave which spirals through the plastic (using it as a waveguide) for example, might actually travel to the bottom much faster. The top pushes on air which has a faster speed of sound, and emits light which goes even faster. But, those forces are not the crucial force which holds the slinky up and therefore needs to change.",1340176350

Both refer to 2001/77, which details the condition of access to the grid for renewables. The language is relatiely clear Art. 7 - 1, if we distinguish between ""access to the grid"" meaning in the first part ""right to connect"" and ""right to output"" in the second part.<p>> Without prejudice to the maintenance of the reliability
> and safety of the grid, Member States shall take the necessary

> When dispatching generating installations,
> transmission system operators shall give priority to

For example someone claiming to have been with the company for a year longer than they really were in a role they never held (eg: someone working in customer service at Facebook from 2008 - 2009 then claiming on their resum they worked in the engineering department from 2008 - 2011).",1340175672

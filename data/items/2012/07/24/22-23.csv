I'd assume that state and local are always identical.<p>I was confused by ""partnered"". I took it to mean specifically domestic partners and would have been confused if I were trying to use the tool if I were unmarried but buying a house with my girlfriend or college buddy.<p>That stood out to me as a specific tweak. Generally, I'd like to see the ability to change some numbers. For example, you recommended that I can afford a house about 20% more than what I actually feel comfortable with, so I'd be more interested in comparing rent vs. buy with the lower house value I'd like to use. I'd also use a VA loan over a FHA due to better terms (no PMI), but there's no where for me to tweak those values.<p>Although, if you feel like you need to handle same sex couples properly, I should note that there are many times more couples eligible to use a VA loan than same sex couples.<p>At this point, I would not use the recommendations of your tool. There isn't enough information about what assumptions you make, like how you calculate property tax and whether you are bundling in insurance into the part you assume to be an income tax deduction.<p>I'd also like to see expected case home price changes, inflation, and investment returns, along with the combination of likely range of returns that would push rent vs. buy in different directions (i.e. good investment returns with low inflation makes renting better, high inflation makes buying better).",1343170587

(I know city dependent)<p>There is absolutely no reason that PadMapper cannot call them on the phone, and ask them to list with PadMapper. They can make it trivially easy supporting email, phone, or fax listings. They can <i>sell them</i> on using PadMapper.<p>Many apartments are owned by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) there are dozens (not hundreds) of those. You can <i>sell the REIT</i> on the concept of easy listings that are so much better/cleaner/easier than Craigslist.<p>Craigslist was created when near every apartment was listed in the Classified Ads in the print newspaper. That wasn't ""lock in"" it was an opportunity, they sold these folks on lower costs (since Classifieds were a money fund for newspapers) Landlords hated the extortionate prices that the newspapers charged but they didn't have an alternative, Craigslist gave them that alternative, they moved.<p>So the 'answer' here is to actually build a classifieds business around rental space. That takes more than slinging some node.js and scraping other sites. Granted its 'easier' for a technical person to do it that way, but its not a 'sustainable' way of doing it.",1343170573

4288483,comment,4286758,4288080,8,0,allritenow,,,"10 hours shifts are actually 10.5 hours as there is a .5 hour lunch in the middle.  So you have a night shift and a day shift that total 21 hours of work in the warehouse.  This leaves three hours of down time for maintenance (both mechanical and software) that is very much needed to keep things rolling.  In order to fill customer orders, they NEED the labor to be as constant as possible.  The difference between 17 hours and 21 hours of filling orders would be quite drastic.  \nDuring peak, especially the three weeks prior to Christmas, the shifts are actually 12 hours.  This leads to massive amounts of frustration as night and day shifts step on each other trying to get the hell in/out.  And parking, long lines at security, crowded break room, etc add to the frustrations.  Maintenance has to fix things on the fly while we try to work and software pushes gone bad (they limit them as much as possible during this time) can just kill a facility.",1343170561

As far as I can tell, all the problems, bar those that stem directly from funding, have always been there. That's the nature of the institution.<p>What changed, for CS at least, is that Google provides much of what is attractive to academia, but has all the funding that is required to make the other roadblocks go away. Google is not like Xerox PARC or MERL or Microsoft Research or other industry research labs. It's a company that's built upon <i>being</i> a research lab. I can believe the hey-days of Sun and SGI were probably similar.<p>The easiest way I describe working at Google to my grad friends is ""It's a giant grad lab, except grads are also the ones running it, and they're billionaires."" Academia can't compete with that, and it never did. The open question is not how to fix academia (as it never will be), but whether the Google model is sustainable. For as long as the Google model does exist, you will always see a net loss of professors to industry, rather than the other way around.",1343170551

It does turn up in places that apparently have nothing to do with circles.  It's a bit like <i>e</i> in that regard.<p>Next, we don't have to assume it's ""magical,"" but some of the properties are noteworthy.  The fact that 355/113 is such a good approximation, and yet it doesn't appear to turn up naturally in any of the proven convergences is a bit odd.  <i>Why</i> does it not turn up?  The only place it <i>does</i> turn up is when you write down the <i>ad hoc</i> continued fraction to express the value you already know.  That seems unnatural, and immediately leads to a desire for further investigation.<p>And finally, mathematicians have a feel for things that are ""natural,"" and that's what they end up exploring. Often it leads nowhere interesting, but sometimes it leads to unexpected connections, and occasionally to equally unexpected applications.  But in all, some questions just feel right for exploration, and some properties of <i>pi</i> fall into that category. You never really know exactly <i>what</i> will advance math - we only have intuition to guide us in deciding what is an ""interesting question.""",1343170071
4288442,comment,4286325,4288251,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"As others have pointed out Craigslist can claim copyright to the collection. The legal theory I would expect them to use is that PadMapper wouldn't know about these listings if they didn't access Craigslist's collection, therefore their use of the <i>collection</i> violated Craigslist's copyright.<p>I did a quick Blekko for the case with the Yellow Pages that was litigated this way (but alas did not find it) where a AT&T sued the maker of a competitive Yellow Pages over using the collection of businesses in their book. The defendant argument was similar to yours, that they could have walked down the street and collected the information so the information wasn't copyrightable, but the judge ruled in favor of AT&T because it was clear the defendant <i>could</i> have done that but they <i>didn't</i> do that. There was some errors and omissions that mirrored the Yellow pages and 'proved' the defendant took their data from the Yellow Pages rather than collect it themselves.<p>For PadMapper to escape liability they have to be able to prove they came to know about these listings in some other way than through Craigslist's collection of them. They argued in their blog that 3Taps did that for them because they got them from 3Taps they aren't liable for what ever 3Taps is doing. And my take on it is that given the case law it will be a very hard thing to prove.

With corporate or government clients that amount is just not even realistic at all.  30 days is fairly standard.  45 or even 90 days is not unrealistic for larger contracts.<p>I also think that 10% per week late fee - though I certainly understand and sympathize with a freelancers grief - it gives me a somewhat unprofessional impression of a freelancer who is either not financially stable or just vindictive.  When I hire somebody I like to feel that they will be around next month.  A more friendly approach with long-term benefit is to just stop working with clients who don't pay on time.<p>To make your life more stable as a freelancer I can say from experience that you want to obtain repeat clients as soon as possible - clients who want you to work on either retainer, or at least agree to some minimum amount of hours per month.  Over time get rid of clients that don't pay on time or are problematic in other ways.  Once you get past that point freelancing can be a really enjoyable and profitable to earn a living.

A ""secret national security court""[0] determines whether the laws voted on by Congress are constitutional? Good information is paramount in developing good opinions. It would certainly be unwise to inform parties that have been wiretapped, but ballpark estimates of how many people are wiretapped and with what level of intrusiveness are necessary to really form an opinion.<p>Second, there is a surprising level of apathy on both sides. Of course most people would object to a secret court to resolve questions of government power, if asked, but no one seems to consider this a question worth debating. I see some editorials explaining that warrantless wire taps are an unfortunately necessary tool in modern law enforcement, but these seem to focus on explaining why the taps really aren't a huge deal, or why the airport scanners are not really invasive, but never why they are positive steps in the right direction, actions to be applauded.<p>These two properties combine in an unfortunate feedback loop: it takes an inordinate amount of effort to obtain reliable information on programs such as this, and without enough initial paranoia, few delve deeper. But without easy access to what's actually happening, it's hard for the non-paranoid to get upset: there's little to do other than to say ""hey! the NSA might be wiretapping, we think, but we don't know who, and we don't know when and we don't know how many.""<p>[0] WSJ: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444097904577539413137490028.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000087239639044409790457753...</a>",1343169655

The problem is that things that don't work are not usually publishable.  This leads to 'fluffing' up results (read enough academic papers and you'll find some hilarity there) and avoiding anything that might not pan out.<p>Just as important is funding, even a small lab with a few computers and one or two grad students needs funding. And in CS that largely means DARPA or a handful of other government agencies.  If your particular research interest involves eventually killing someone, you'll do fantastic.  There are of course other sources of funding but they typically have much smaller wallets, especially the further you go on the 'for the good of humanity' scale.<p>I've seen countless times were grad students are doing something really interesting, but because it's not going to help anyone get tenure and not going to bring in any funding, these students are strongly encourage to 'get back on track'.",1343168369

IIRC, the first generation of Core 2 Duo machines shipped with 32-bit EFI, even though the processor is 64-bit. The 64-bit kernel, which is now the default and only kernel in Mountain Lion, requires 64-bit firmware which your machine doesn't have.<p>They probably could have engineered the 64-bit kernel to work with the 32-bit EFI, or the probably could have shipped an EFI update for old Core 2 Duo machines, but those machines <i>are</i> 6 years old.

Much more mystery.

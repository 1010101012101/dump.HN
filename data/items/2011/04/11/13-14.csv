2432568,comment,2427944,2431695,1,0,kragen,,,"In case anyone's interested, I successfully entered the following version in DOSBOX using COPY CON, and indeed even used it to recreate a copy of itself:<p><pre><code>    kragen@inexorable:~/devel/inexorable-misc$ od -t u1 hexconv.com\n    0000000 180   1 205  33  36  15 136 194 192 226   4 205  33  36  15   1\n    0000020 194 180   2 205  33 235 233\n    0000027\n</code></pre>\nIt turns out the 08 meaning ""or %al,"" was getting interpreted by COPY CON as a backspace, so this version adds AX to DX instead.  (I sure am glad I didn't have to debug that using TYPE.)  This program has advantages and disadvantages compared to COPY CON:<p>1. It echoes its input so you can see, at least in theory, if you made a mistake.<p>2. You only need to type two keystrokes instead of one to four per byte.<p>3. There are no forbidden bytes. At least in Dosbox, COPY CON converts ^@ to the sequence 00 03, interprets 08 as backspace (even if entered on the keypad with Alt), and stops copying when it gets a carriage return, even if the carriage return was entered with Alt.<p>4. To exit, you must reboot.  In Dosbox, the output has already been flushed to the filesystem, but I have my doubts about whether, on MS-DOS, every single INT 21H AH=2 would write a 512-byte floppy disk sector with the newly appended byte.  On the other hand, you could probably just mash some key on autorepeat long enough to fill up a couple of sectors, and you'd be good to go.  This program, after all, only has to be sufficient to enter the next phase of the bootstrap, one with backspace and explicit termination.<p>5. There is no backspace, so if you hit any incorrect keystrokes, you must start over.  For programs of this size, that's not a major constraint  it's pretty easy to carefully enter 40 or 50 or 100 keystrokes without making any errors  but it becomes more serious as programs get larger.",1302530354

Such high gamma gives a very collimated beam of radiation, of order 1/gamma, due to relativistic beaming. So taking 1/1000 radians as a ballpark value, 1mrad is about the divergence of a typical laser. (Laser pointers have slightly higher divergence due to the short cavity, but things like He-Ne lasers are typically 1mrad.)",1302530353

2432520,comment,2431006,2432256,2,0,Isofarro,,,"With the rather strict definition of SEO you seem to hold, and a very high-level definition of concepts, your above comments make sense. Yet, in practice, SEOers get involved in a larger number of areas than just figuring out how to optimise organic search, they get involved in the general role of getting more targetted visitors to the site, so pure technical search engine blackbox testing is one skill in their toolbox.<p>They get involved in the AdSense part of search engines, where changes in advertising wording affect the number of people clicking on that ad. A marketing department most likely wouldn't be able to come anywhere near an SEO who knows what audiences are searching for and the material on their site that matches that criteria. The flexibility and quick reaction times here, a decent SEO will outscore a ""big campaign"" focused marketing department.<p>So funnel optimisation then can be on the remit of an SEO - the funnel between the website, and the conversion goal (getting the right people from a search engine results page to the right piece of content. The route is an essential part of it - do people get there directly, or via an intermediate page - will marketers have sufficient technical knowledge and understanding of searching patterns to make a good decision?)<p>So in terms of funnel optimisation, of course, testing and optimising content that people see to increase conversion rates - it makes a great deal of sense to have an SEO involved.<p>Analytics - yes, it's the tool that measures the effect of SEO. But who is going to set that up accurately? Whose going to know what beacons/shims are needed where to be able to measure the effectiveness of their work? If anyone, SEO are quite the right group of people to ensure that beacons are in the right places, and remain in the right place, adjusting, correcting and improving as the site and it's traffic grows. I don't see a marketer, a web developer or an engineer having the inclination or dedication to keeping that running optimally.<p>Content strategy - do you really want product reference and howto guides in the hands of marketers? Seriously? Sure, for a brochureware site right before the signup, I guess marketers should be substantially involved here. But the support material? SEOers are well placed to connect the right support material with the people looking for it.<p>Reputation tracking - I'm not convinced this is entirely in the remit of PR - they are likely to ignore a handful of complaints in tweets in favour of the bigger picture. Best get a customer servicing person involved. And a couple of well thought out tweets and conversations from a knowledgeable SEO wouldn't go amiss either.<p>Competitive research - again, at such a high level fine, pay some consultant. At the ""why is their website doing better than mine"" an SEO will outdo a marketing consultant any day.<p>Social media marketing - again, you're focusing at a far to high level. PR/Marketing aren't the right people to tackle customer servicing issues that surface in social media conversations. And talking to the listening audience on Facebook and Twitter - the key is to do it with a human voice, not a PR/Marketing filtered voice.<p>Syndication - Legal? On a high-level approach on contracts/agreements between organisations for syndicating content (like AP news items), yes you should involve someone from legal. But tweaking your RSS feed?<p>duplicate content issues - I'd be very impressed if there was anyone working in a legal department on legal matters who could explain where there were duplicate content issues on their employer's site and recommend a good way of correcting / addressing that. My long experience of lawyers is that they believe deep linking is a breach of copyright.<p>You're focusing on a too high-level definition of these various aspects of running a website. An SEO is a very handy person to have around in the trenches. Whereas at the high level you are considering this, what PR, Marketing and Legal provide is close to useless on a day-to-day basis.<p>An SEO person is invaluable at the very granular level, the day-to-day issues that make a website work.

[1][2]<p>I have to decide if I partner with someone who has a clear sociopath profile. He will be damn efficient at sales, but it is virtually impossible to do collaborative work with him. He will be always measuring his power and negotiating for advantage. It's emotionally tiring to deal with him already. He will spend all his metal energy making sure things are done the way he wants them. Will behave like a CEO, even when his role is not CEO.

2432436,story,,,12,8,bendtheblock,"Ask HN: A Taxonomy of Startup Strategies",,"I've been observing online startups for a few years now and I'm interested in identifying a taxonomy.<p>I just put these together. Note that these are intentionally kept vertical-agnostic.<p>High-scope Infrastructure - use domain knowledge and innovation to provide a turnkey solution to a broad array of customers. Customers outsource to the service instead of attempting to roll their own equivalent. The company gives them a better solution than they could build for the same price. These startups usually ride on a new innovation and are capital intensive. (Amazon EC2, AppJet, Skype, Heroku, Sendgrid, Dropbox, iPad PoS)<p>High-scope Web App - as above but the utility is delivered via a traditional web app. These companies are still 'high-scope' even if they only provide services to a particular vertical, because their solution is usually more general than an equivalent in-house one would be. (Basecamp, Hoodle, Freshbooks, Convore, Wufoo, Xero, most SaaS)<p>Direct Marketplace - facilitates real commerce directly between two parties, where one or both can be a consumer or business. Users are attracted to these services because they can trade goods or services. Reliance on network effect. (eBay, Etsy, AirBnB, limos.com, Smarkets, Groupon, Kickstarter, 99designs, Theme Forest, GumTree)<p>Ad Marketplace - as above but for ads only (Gumtree, Craig's List)<p>Ads with peripheral service/content - visitors are attracted by the utility of a service or by engaging content, revenue from on-page ads. Even though the 'peripheral service' takes significant effort, the underlying aim is to drive traffic for the consumption of ads (Facebook, Google, SongKick, about.com, justin.tv, Reddit and other community sites)<p>Do you agree with these? What would yours be?",1302527849

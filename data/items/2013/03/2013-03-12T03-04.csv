Birth rates in many countries (not just industrial, first world) have dropped below replacement rates for long enough that we'll likely see a plateau in total population, and possibly a drop, as there won't be enough young people having babies to replace the big bubble of old people that all start to die off together.<p>Interesting presentation on it here:<p><a href=""http://longnow.org/seminars/02004/aug/13/the-depopulation-problem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://longnow.org/seminars/02004/aug/13/the-depopulation-pr...</a><p>by this guy:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Longman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Longman</a>",1363060637

5360037,comment,5359458,5359458,3,0,smartician,,,"Instead of job destruction, you could say we're just becoming more efficient at doing things. This is nothing new, it's a trend that started with division of labor in the Stone Age. Then we invented currency to distribute the fruits of this divided labor somewhat evenly among the participants. Now we're seeing that the value and income gap between professions is becoming wider and wider, and it's developing into a real problem.<p>Some proposed fixes like raising the minimum wage will only work temporarily, as it increases the pressure to become more efficient. A basic income might indeed be a better approach, but the problem is that we'll have a lower class of bored, but somewhat poor people. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out. I think Europe's ""social market economies"" with high taxes and high benefits are in a better position to handle this than the US's gung-ho capitalism.<p>And to say that higher-level languages and open source products are making software engineers obsolete is a bit short sighted. Sure, languages and frameworks have become more powerful, but the problems to solve have become orders of magnitude harder, and new problems have arisen.

Given that's what actually matters and not the gender of the person.<p>If your workplace culture is getting in the way of hiring the best person for the job, then that's a problem that transcends gender. By the logic that women won't be comfortable taking a job where there aren't other women, then businesses should make sure to have someone of every race, gender, religion and age so they don't put off any potential applicants.<p>I'd love to see any empirical evidence whatsoever to support the myriad assumptions made in this article.<p>Don't say that ""we only hire the top 1% of candidates"" because women aren't confident enough to apply to those jobs? Female tech workers don't know/like what the word ""hacker/hack"" means?<p>This quote in particular seems to sum up a bizarre focus on gender above all issues:<p>""If you cant find potential female candidates, youre just being lazy.""<p>An employer being lazy about hiring people? We live in a society where there are often hundreds or even thousands of applications for a single position because of a massive labor surplus.<p>The vastly disproportionate effort that's being recommended towards hiring women smacks of rank tokenism.<p>It's hard to see how the women that Cristina Cordova envisions inhabit the tech industry have the necessary metacognitive skills to be an effective/assertive member of any workforce. If they're so insecure as to be put off from a good position by the term ""hacker"", or so intimidated by groups who don't look like them, how can they be expected to handle other tasks that require confidence, assertiveness, and ability to deal with people different from yourself?<p>Thankfully all the women I've met in the tech industry seem to be a far cry from this stereotype.

I like to poke at this delusion when I can.<p>I'm not exactly sure why you think the FDIC should not micromanage the mortgage market.  My guess is because the FDIC is government bureaucracy, and our government is so dysfunctional these days, that you think any attempt to manage mortgage markets would just make things more screwed up.  And you are probably correct.  Although I would say the cat's a little out of the bag with regards to preventing government bureaucracies from messing around with mortgage markets....

If you have even easier ways, that require even less government micromanagement, I'd be intrigued to hear them.<p>In any scenario in which Michael or I actually have enough power to direct the FDIC or government to carry out our madcap plans, the political situation would be so different that many current arguments against FDIC intervention would be obsolete.

These results are consistent across the app, where tornado seems to about 3 times faster. I am assuming that maybe this is due to the quality of the libraries, since i assume node is faster.

I didn't identify with the bag of gold as inventory. Maybe that's just me.<p>6. Drop-down is sort of annoying. Take a look at Amazon's magic drop-down [1].<p>7. Tutorials that actually let you do things are good. Especially the fact that you can talk to the tutorial guys as many times as you need. Reminds me a bit of Runescape's tutorial... but then I never got through that.<p>8. No walking animation? Hum.<p>9. Clicking on the Makeover Guy caused me to click on the square behind him. I had to click his square to talk to him. I don't think there's really a completely unambiguous way to do it, though; good that it's settled here instead of later.<p>10. Makeover should be left/right arrows around a characteristic.<p>11. Pixel-art does not work when I can't see the pixels. I can't make out my guy's face.<p>12. Cool map so far pretty cohesive, in fact  but the tile-disappearing and reappearing is somewhat jolting.<p>13. How are all these people standing on water? Why can't I do that?<p>14. I can't read the numbers on the fish merchant's tiles. Use white-on-black text, and make it a tad larger.<p>15. How do I <i>attempt</i> to cook? What exactly happened in the event of failure? I dropped my frying pan into the fire or something?<p>16. Level up in cooking, woo! Make this feel like more of an achievement, with animation and a flashing up arrow and whatnot, and it should help to hook players.<p>17. Don't these rats have any sort of movement AI? Rats don't just sit there. Hitting rats might as well be hitting statues.<p>18. Why can't I hit this other guy? I want to hit him.<p>19. Entire mining guide can be found on forums? NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT! This breaks you out of the immersive experience. Provide it if you must, but not in the tutorial message box.<p>20. Random CAPTCHA? Oh lawd what is this I don't have all day to spend staring at my guy hitting a rock. Especially if I don't hear a notification sound.<p>21. I currently have -1 penalty points... what? What does this even mean? Is this XP? Should I be thankful that I'm not being penalized? I can't imagine a player being thankful for that.<p>22. What's a mould?<p>23. Why is this furnace using <i>all</i> of my clay? I only ever selected one! Cooking did this too I looked away for a moment and all my fish were cooked. That must be the most dangerous way to cook.<p>At this point I'm kinda bored. What am I supposed to be doing in the game? If there's a goal  killing the lich lord, saving the princess, it doesn't really matter I can see all my tutorialing as a ramp up to that. I'll actually be excited that I'm leveling up because then I can do something with those levels. Without it I don't actually know that I'll get to do anything. Perhaps that's just me being impatient; there are, after all, plenty of other players.<p>Overall though it looks like you have a fairly engaging and functional game. The amount of effort that went into making this must have been unreasonably large. I think that with polish and a bit more engagement you could have a game that people actually play regularly. But if you do: what makes your game better than any other game? Are there cooler battle systems? In-depth alchemy? An artificially-simulated NPC economy? Government? There has to be at least one major thing that no one else has.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...</a>",1363058769

Then one needs to include two different transactions into the two blockchains. ( In the theoretical scenario, by mining another block for one of the chains. ) For this I do not need to have 51% of the hashing power, but the branch of the blockchain needs to be supported by 50% of the hashing power.<p>EDIT: Thinking a bit more about this, it seems that the probability to suceed with such an attack seems to rely on the attackers abbility to craft a 'splitting block', which should be proportional to the share of the attacker controlled hashing power and the ability of the 'incompatible' clients to outgrow the standard block chain. ( So that a merchant with an 'incompatible' client accepts a payment based on the fork of the blockchain.)

That sounds like a joke, but it's actually a pretty good description of what happens in a typical startup. It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb. We avoided dying till we got rich.</i><p>That said, I don't necessarily agree with the criteria asserted in TFA for being a ""zombie"" startup (which presumably means it's <i>effectively</i> dead, but just hasn't realized it yet), at least not without a lot more context around <i>when</i> to apply them.<p>Given the following as identifiers of a ""zombie"" startup:<p><i>You havent hit 10% week-over-week growth on any meaningful metric (revenue, active users, etc)</i><p><i>Youre working on the same idea after 12+ months and still havent launched</i><p><i>Youve launched an enterprise service and have less than 2% week-over-week growth in revenue pipeline</i><p>I'd say none of those are valid in isolation.  If you're doing an enterprise, B2B play, for example, the lead time to get that first sale can be pretty dang big, and from the first sale to the second sale can still be pretty big... you could easily go quite some time without being able to talk about 10% revenue growth.  But getting to even <i>one</i> sale and having <i>any</i> revenue is a binary difference between <i>not</i> having revenue.  So what do you do until you get there?<p>Or to use a ""hits close to home"" example... we have been working on an enterprise startup for some time, and don't have any revenue yet.  Zombie?  I don't think so, we just made a conscious decision to forego seeking outside funding, and do the bootstrapped, self-funded model (for now anyway) while working our dayjobs.  This necessarily means slower progress, but the thing is, we <i>are</i> making progress.  Not in revenue yet, but in terms of working through @sgblank's Customer Development process, learning about our customers and their problems, learning more about how to market the kind of stuff we're building, learning more about our competitors, and building the product.<p>Of course, a cynic might look at us and go ""Yeah, you guys are exactly what TFA means, give up now.""  But we look at it this way: We're running <i>very</i> lean, with almost no burn rate to speak of, learning more every day, and moving towards product/market fit and that first dollar of revenue.  And since we have no burn rate to speak of, we can ""not die"" for a pretty long time, as long as the co-founders stay motivated.<p>Of course, there probably will be a point in time when metrics like ""10% revenue growth over $SOME_TIMESPAN"" will be a reasonable metric, but that time isn't now for us.",1363058413

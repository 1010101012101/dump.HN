115348,story,,,5,8,jrsims,"Linux vs. BSD on EC2",,"After reading the prior thread about whether or not startups should use EC2 for hosting, I was left wondering what the leanest possible approach would be to hosting an OS image... and do we have a truly optimal image for this purpose yet?<p>From a strictly computational perspective, which OS platform is better suited for this? My guess is that this contest would be between Linux and BSD (Solaris has too fat an ass?). From what I understand, the BSDs are tightly engineered with the goals of performance and efficiency in mind (still has the best networking stack, or so I hear), whereas Linux may tend to be more hackish (I am not an authority here!). However, Linux's advantage could be its modularity, making it easier to shape it to specialized puposes (like cloud computing).<p>I've heard a lot of geeks say that although Linux makes for a better free desktop, a BSD would be their first choice as a server.<p>So, in the cloud computing landscape, who will perform better? A tight BSD image, or a tight Linux image? Which will be more efficient in terms of computational resources used?<p>BONUS QUESTION: Do you think virtualization services like EC2 will drive the creation of new *nix variants that are optimized for max price/performance on cloud services? If you know of any that exist now, please post links!",1202946269

115339,comment,115158,115267,0,0,krschultz,,,"Yea, but that would assume a base tuition of 35,000, which there is no reason to spend. Go to a state school if the money is an issue, out of state to Penn State, considered one of the more expensive state schools, is 24,000 a year. That leaves 26,000 a year for living expenses. In state is even less. At my school it is 18,000 out of state and 7,000 in state and we're top 25 nationwide in both of my majors. My apartment is one of the nicer ones on campus and it is $700 a month, plus $500 for food and expenses, plus 2,000 for books and supplies, I'm barely up to 35,000 and that is with generous allouances and an expensive apartment. In state you could be doing it for 20,000 a year. The people who claim college is outrageous are far from the ground level. I don't know anyone who couldn't work it out by taking loans and going to a state school, everyone quotes these private schools and their prices but that is a whole different ball game. The reality is that college is not all that expensive in the short term, and it is nothing in the long term.",1202945291

If I rewrite a program to solve the same problem, then I'll end up having exactly the same code.  This is useless.  If I am solving a different problem, then rewriting is usually in order.<p>In regards to writing (re)readable code, I feel that the word ""readable"" leaves the door open to a lot of abuse, and doesn't shut the door firmly on those who encourage literate code, James Joycian code, commented code, etc!  ""Readable"" has connotations that one can read it at leisure, like a novel.  It allows for some excess, some baggage.  If there were an adjective which meant ""the uncompromising naked terseness of mathematics, complete absence of comments except in pathological cases (to be avoided!), and short identifiers, especially in inner scopes,"" then I'd use that adjective.<p>I usually think in terms of Occam's Razor: what minimal program description reproduces the subjective effect that a user desires?  I feel that any other approach would be based on ideology.  ""X-Acto blade like code,"" perhaps, rather than ""readable code?""",1202945194
115334,comment,115158,115293,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Nah, there's just not a good way to rate and rank potential job candidates without actually taking the time to get to know them.  Finishing college is just an imperfect proxy for being smart and working hard, and companies use it as a baseline because it puts the onus on students/employees to attain.  If there was a way for companies to more accurately rank candidates (without actually requiring more work on the company's part), they'd use that instead.  Universities are more than happy to facilitate this.<p>See also <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/10/the-greatest-ma.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/10/the-greatest...</a>",1202945184

All user has to type in is his/her GTalk/MSN/Yahoo/AIM or ICQ id. Upon submission our system instantly sends back an IM message right to user's messenger with a unique link to his newly created personal account page. Since we don't have authorization per se (it's done on the messenger side when user signs-in into IM account), the percentage is very high, I believe 50% or even higher. One of the advantages is there's no need to remember another, most likely useless, login name and password. ;-)<p>The other question I would arise is what is the percentage of active users you have.

Don't overpay for school?<p>Nobody is measuring the importance of school, on how much fun you have with it, but what I am saying is that you can learn a lot, and yet have a great time, and yes even fun.  Unless you are sociophobe, scrooge, or something, most humans want some fun on the side.<p>I thought CS was not that difficult, so I decided to minor in math, which I found it not that difficult so I challenged myself even more, and I decided to minor in Physics, and here I met my match.  A hard ass professor, that would teach a lot, but it was almost impossible to get an A.  My first ever class, where I felt no matter how much effort I put into it, I couldn't get an A.  It taught me about humility, and learning my limitations.<p>And, yes, I did all that, plus lot's of volunteering, helping with alumni affairs, while having a part time job (washing dishes, and then just a lab proctor) at the same time.<p>There is nothing more awesome when you learn a lot, and yet can have fun and get laid at the same time.<p>To all you say that college is waste of time:<p>1. Maybe you should study something that you are going to get a great return out of it, or it will be challenging enough.<p>2. You might want to check if you have problems getting socially adjusted.<p>So, unless you quit school and become a millionare by now, you have no cred on saying college is a waste of time.   College is a waste of time for many, b/c they don't use it. To those that are smart enough, it is a great learning experience.
To those that think are too smart for college, maybe they are not taking the right/classes or programs.  If you are a genius, what prevents you from finishing it in two years, get a masters, get a phd. and become the next albert einstein, invent cold fusion, a cure for H1V or something great?
You can do that in college.  It allows very smart people, to have access to great equipment, grant money and other resarch, things that you probably wont have in your own basement.",1202945060
115331,comment,115158,115246,0,0,krschultz,,,"Of course it is horribly inaccurate but his numbers are pulled out of thin air. If you could find a way to justify skipping college economically, for real people, I'm all ears. In fact money wise, college is one of the best investments you can ever make, there are countless studies to back that up. I really don't see what the big rush to skip college is. Do you really think that starting a company 4 years sooner is that big deal? If so then your business is going to fail because it is dependent on ONE idea rather than the skill of the people involved. A good group of people will find a new idea when need be, the world has plenty of problems to solve. So what are you in a rush to do? Work? You have all your life to do that. I think that the experiance of college when you are 18-22 is a thing you either do or you don't, there is no going back to do it later. On the other hand, you can start a business, travel, learn things, and work for the rest of your life. College is what you make of it, no one forces you to do anything here. I can't imagine being bored, I have about twice as much I would like to do as I have time for, the people who say it is a ""waste of time"" are ones with no initiative.",1202944719

I'll grant you that people (in this country) would be better served by slowing down a bit, but I wouldn't encourage a high school kid to start a business instead of going to college.<p>Maybe it's a good idea for a kid to work on his ""startup"" when he's barely old enough to shave, but probably not.

115326,story,,,15,18,dfranke,"Hack idea: text classification for political propaganda",,"Reading the campaign material of political candidates in order to figure out what they stand for is a rather annoying exercise.  Invariably, they're 95% fluff.  Look at<p>http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/65bd0fbe-737b-4851-a7e7-d9a37cb278db.htm .<p>It isn't my intent to pick on McCain, but this makes a good example.  These five paragraphs are almost but not quite semantically null.  I can glean from the first paragraph that he believes in man-made global warming, and from the fourth paragraph that he supports nuclear energy.  This is useful information, but having to parse five paragraphs to discover it seems inefficient.<p>I think text classifiers might be able to improve this process.  ""Nuclear energy"" seems like it would be a pretty strong ham token, while ""for our children"" and ""addressing the challenges"" seem pretty spammy.  Trying this out is not quite as simple as just feeding things into CRM114, because we're trying to classify parts of messages rather than complete messages.  It ought to possible to work around that, though: perhaps score each clause, each sentence, and each paragraph, and then somehow derive an overall score from these inputs.<p>Anyone think this could work?",1202944306

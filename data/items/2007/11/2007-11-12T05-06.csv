Don't know how in other countries, but in Poland, philosophy undergrands have to master the logic. Nothing fancy, basically the easiest elementary logic. And you know what? According to her, a lot of people have problems with it. I've had very similar experiences before with friends studying liberal arts and science that were required to learn logic.",1194846780

78621,comment,78594,78594,0,0,bmaier,,,">>When their intensity is combined with multi-potentiality, these youngsters become particularly frustrated with the existential limitations of space and time. There simply aren't enough hours in the day to develop all of the talents that many of these children have. Making choices among the possibilities is indeed arbitrary; there is no ""ultimately right"" choice. Even choosing a vocation can be difficult if one is trying to make a career decision between essentially equal passion, talents and potential in violin, neurology, theoretical mathematics and international relations.<p>I'm curious how others have dealt with this.  When faced with seemingly equal career and life decisions how to you go about choosing what vocation or path to pursue.  <p>Does anyone have any specific methods?",1194846322

When you get tense, or feel like relaxing, focus for a moment on your heartbeat and breathing, and give a little part of your brain to slowing both down a bit. Repeat as necessary. ",1194845120

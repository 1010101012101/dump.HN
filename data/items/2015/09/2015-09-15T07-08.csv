While you&#x27;re right, and the products aren&#x27;t completely similar, Google has done well with market penetration for Google Apps for Business (at least as far as companies who aren&#x27;t running a Microsoft stack). Even if Evernote is in many ways &quot;better&quot; than Google Docs for a particular purpose, if you have Google Apps paid for, it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; for most uses (especially sharing/collaboration). So it&#x27;s equivalent in some senses, but certainly not all.",1442303790

10219456,comment,10217887,10218413,0,0,dwenzek,,,"No, I disagree.
GraphQL is definitely a query language,
since it allows to specify pieces of data to be extracted from a whole data set.<p>Compared to SQL,
this is done using an unusual manner,
giving a shape of the data we want around some seed,
but the approach is both expressive and efficient.
In light of this query principle,
it is perhaps unfortunate that GraphQL use a different syntax for the query and the response.
To this regard, freebase&#x27;s MQL is more pure 
(<a href=""http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/MQL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/MQL</a>).<p>About graph, I think the term applies too.
Indeed, a GraphQL defines a subgraph to be extracted from a whole graph,
even if the tree shape of the response forces to resort to ids to tie the loop.<p>Compared to a graph traversal query language like Gremlin
(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlin_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlin_%28programming_languag...</a>),
I find the pattern approach of GraphQL simpler to grasp;
and even easier to implement efficiently in a distributed setting.
I implemented years ago a distributed graph database for Yahoo!;
and the query language, based on shapes to be extracted around seeds,
was a key design choice for an efficient architecture and short query delays.",1442303498

Everything from a compelling experience for buyers, to a feature-rich platform for sellers, to a backend manufacturing pipeline to fulfil orders. At Teespring, “full stack” means anything from warehouse management systems to our 3rd party API to the number crunching analytics behind our campaign dashboards. It’s up to you to pick the challenge which excites you the most!<p>What is the job?
We take code quality and engineering efficiency seriously. Engineers pair about 50% of the time, and we have a robust but lightweight code review process to disseminate knowledge. Nothing goes to production with automated testing. We do 2-week sprints, with engineers&#x27; input a key part of the planning process. Your expert input will also be considered when planning new feature work: both in terms of implementation decisions, and product experience.<p>Who is the ideal candidate?
A passionate programmer with a leaning towards full-stack development. Substantial front ends skills are a definite boon, since many features have some user interface component. Deep, professional experience with Rails will be especially useful. A person with strong opinions, weakly-held.<p>If you are successful in this role, a year from now:
Your team-mates will look to you for technical advice, guidance, and mentorship. You will have architected and led the creation of a significant piece of the team’s technology. Our collaborative environment and generous training budget will have substantially enriched your technical abilities. You will be speaking as an expert in your field at conferences and meetups.<p>Our Environment:
Modern Rails Stack, React.js, TDD/BDD with RSpec/Cucumber, Golang. A big push towards CD and SOA at the moment.<p>What do we offer?
Happiness is just as important to us as hard work. All startups in San Francisco offer the same perks, but what makes us different is our desire to completely change how the world thinks about custom e-commerce. That being said, here are the benefits you will receive: working with talented, collaborative, and entrepreneurial teams. Medical, dental and vision insurance for you, your family, and pet. Unlimited paid time off and 9 paid holidays. Generous stock options. Free (delicious) catered lunch and dinner daily. Fully stocked kitchen with drinks, snacks, and bar. Training, career development, and meet-up hosting. Fun SOMA office offering easy access to Muni, Bart, and Caltrain with commuter benefits. Social activities, office happy hours, concerts, game room, and endless free t-shirts!<p>Please email your resume to brad@teespring.com to learn more",1442303234

I haven&#x27;t really looked at the emails since they came out, and at this point the details blur, and I&#x27;m not eager to dive back into them.   It&#x27;s more that they lowered the level of trust I had in the good faith of some of the participants.

It wasn&#x27;t a matter of smoking guns, rather lack of honorable exoneration for things that already concerned me. I agree that there were no findings of academic misconduct, but I don&#x27;t think that shows the conduct was &quot;becoming&quot; of a good scientist.",1442301429

Everyone usually calls this &quot;jump offset optimisation&quot;, &quot;instruction encoding selection/optimisation&quot;, or some other variant of those words. Incidentally, the article doesn&#x27;t mention the terms &quot;near&quot; and &quot;short&quot; jumps (16/32 and 8-bit displacement, respectively), which places it in a bit of an island with respect to others looking for related information on this topic.

You can be somewhat more intelligent by not increasing the size for the jumps that won&#x27;t ever grow - e.g. backward ones ones whose target has been resolved already, and there aren&#x27;t enough possibly-growing jumps between it and the current position to overflow the offset. Now iterate the code generation, moving the necessary bytes in the buffer forward when you hit a forward reference that&#x27;s too far, until you reach the end. All done and ready to output, without any excess copying or messing around with linked lists. That&#x27;s what the older assemblers which had this optimisation did, and they were plenty fast.

I used it for a while, back in 2005 or so, but our later contacts have been... less than fortunate. I tried it again two or three years ago and my system regularly broke after every update. I eventually ragequit when I ended up with a system that wouldn&#x27;t boot because, in The Great Move of Everything to /bin, it somehow managed to screw up the bootloader. I figured my data was going to be next, wondered what the fuck they were thinking even in the context of a rolling release, shrugged and wiped it out.<p>The Arch Wiki is a great repository of information though.

Before my trip, I was imagining things much like you&#x27;re describing here. What I saw on my trip was fairly eye-opening.<p>First of all, in much of the country basic services like electricity and running water cannot be taken for granted. Phone service is available -- for a price paid by the minute to some equivalent of a local entrepreneur who has invested money into getting a mobile phone plan and has some means of charging / powering the equipment (solar was the typical method, although I saw more primitive techniques as well). Internet access was generally many miles away in a regional capital, which is probably an all day trip for someone walking or on a horse (cars are for the wealthy). When you get there, access is very expensive.<p>I&#x27;m assuming things have gotten better in the last 15 years. For instance mobile phone penetration was already dramatic when I visited and can only have improved since then. However literacy was a serious problem -- you have to be able to read in order to make sense of almost anything on a computer, and in Senegal at least just knowing French is an elite signifier since most speak Wolof. Very few people were fluent English speakers -- I effectively had to learn pidgin French just to have conversations with the local telecom employees, although thankfully most Internet-specific technical terms were just directly taken from English.<p>In Dakar (the capital city) things were very different. It was pretty much what I imagined a typical city in Africa to be like -- and Internet access there was still expensive but in the realm of affordable. University students got some sort of access that was reasonable, although the pipe out of the country was pitifully small at the time (we had more bandwidth for our office than the whole country had in 2001).<p>The really interesting thing was that no one could figure out how to make money off Internet access other than Internet cafes and connecting people to the very large number of Senegalese who live outside the country. I imagine the remittance market is huge now. However things have changed, it almost certainly hinges on the extreme motivation people there have to better their lives. They will move heaven and earth to make a buck -- SV entrepreneurs could learn a lot from the drive on display everywhere I went. If you can imagine a way to make money from a situation, they were way ahead of you.<p>One last thing -- Senegal is considered one of the African success stories, generally speaking. It is relatively democratic, has a growing economy (without all the problems that come with having oil deposits) and has been the recipient of decades of development funding. <i>Many</i> countries in Africa are worse off than Senegal, and I would imagine the snapshot I got in 2001 looks like utopia to them now.",1442300884

A majority of Internet traffic is bots[1] costing electricity and time sorting through spam. Most of my snail mail by weight and size is trash every single day, waisting effort of an already underfunded and non-profitable USPS. Internet ads clutter up web interfaces and take up cycles in our browsers wasting time and making the delivery of information much less efficient. I feel as though in time, with all the physical and digital public services we have, 60% of infrastructure resources will go toward wasteful and nefarious services, 30% will go toward blocking and mitigating said services, and the remaining 10% will be human activity wondering why everything is so damn slow and expensive.<p>[1]<a href=""http://theweek.com/articles/454320/62-percent-all-web-traffic-comes-from-bots"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theweek.com/articles/454320/62-percent-all-web-traffi...</a>",1442300812

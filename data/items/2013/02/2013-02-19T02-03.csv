5242327,comment,5232893,5235303,1,0,scaphandre,,,"Ha - I agree that that procedure seems preposterous. I have seen it listed in several forums, and only considered it after several others had reported success. I figured it didn't cost much to empirically give it a go. I present weak evidence that it appears it may have helped for me.<p>For what its worth, I am doubtful. There did appear to be some subjective improvement in responsiveness, but I didn't benchmark it. It is not the Calculator app in itself that functions as this, I had originally read any stock Apple app would do it.<p>Software reset does fix this for some, so I don't think that some button state polling problem relating to software is inconceivable. Possible, but unlikely.<p>More info here - they acknowledge it is likely bs.

He went out and deliberately bought 2nd generation commodity seeds.  Simply because of market penetration, most of the seeds ended up being roundup ready seeds.<p>He discovered this because he sprayed them with Roundup.<p>I can't think of a more clear case of patent exhaustion.

They want a price today that's better than the market.<p>Scenario 1: The Broker<p>I want to see Swedish House Mafia but don't want to pay more than $400. Inversely, I bought Beyonc tickets, sobered up, remembered that I hate Beyonc, and would like to get at least $300. Your give the customer a probability of the ticket being sold. Perhaps also the option of resetting the price if the probability falls below X.<p>Scenario 2: The Dealer<p>Consumers buy and sell a small number of tickets. If you bought(sold) tickets when your model said they were likely to go up(down) by a margin in excess of your error you could diversify across multiple event types, venues, artists, and dates. You would be exposed to model (transformed basis) risk and would need to finance inventory.<p>Scenario 3: The Market Maker<p>Derivatives! :D The simplest way to ""do arbitrage without ever holding the tickets"" would be to sell tickets as forwards. To illustrate, let's suppose prices are at $500 and you believe they will fall to $200. You sell a ""ticket"" at $250 to a customer and receive those funds today. The night before the event you buy the ticket at $200 and deliver it to the customer, pocketing the $50 plus interest as your spread. You're still exposed to model risk, but with the benefit of float, i.e. cash today for a deliverable tomorrow. Bonus: easy shorting.",1361242275

It's a win-win for them, as those are a quicker path to promotion than trying to build up internal scope or working with the external market (godforbid <grin>).<p>Frankly, it's really, really expensive and painful for ~2000 developers on three different teams to each be adding a slew of features with one of those teams building on top of and coordinating the other two. Even with huge amounts of communication, tracking, and the best of intents, until the products at the bottom of the chain settle down, you can't make any progress at the top. And when the top is finally making progress, you actually can put developers in front of APIs (in our case) and then you find out that the stuff at the bottom is totally unusable, but it's too late, because they finally stopped churning and want to ship soon.<p>I don't claim there's an easy answer, but throwing more people or tools at the coordination problem doesn't (I've seen it tried).",1361241814

Most new popular rose hybrids are protected under ordinary plant patents.  If you want to grow the plant you need a plant patent license to do so and buying a plant at a store gives you this.  There need not be an explicit license from anyone but the one who actually makes the clones.<p>This is a good balance because the plant patent act does not reach sexual reproduction.  One does not need a plant patent license to hybridize two other patented varieties (rose hybridization is hard too).  This means that the plant patent is very limited in scope.  Transgenic patents which cover sexual reproduction however are largely unlimited in scope and therefore very dangerous and it is for this reason that Monsanto should lose unless Congress speaks clearly that such may be patented.",1361241712

Without fail, every head-hunter is lying or clueless about what they're offering and what their customer is looking for, and this annoys me a lot.<p>Recently I discovered that these parasites mostly work on commission, usually 25-40% of a DevOps' first year salary, which in my area ranges from $120k-$160k. San Francisco is expensive and I'd like to buy a home, which isn't doable on a DevOps' salary unless you win the unwinnable lottery at a start-up, but I'm too old to play that game anymore; I have a family and the risk/reward ratio is incredibly skewed against employees now.<p>I have over twenty years of relevant production Infrastructure experience, so unlike every recruiter/headhunter who has ever contacted me, I know what I'm talking about.

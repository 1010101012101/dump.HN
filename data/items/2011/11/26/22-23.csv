3280970,comment,3280451,3280851,3,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I didn't consider it rambling. Honestly, I feel it's a matter of taste rather than a flaw and I happen to disagree with you. I can't tell you you're right but I also can't say you're wrong. I think Bitabucket and GitHub just have different perspectives on it. GitHub and I seem to agree on the forking issue but that's a coincidence.<p>You did try to talk it out and give some concrete examples. I've seen big whine-athons before and your post does not qualify as that as far as I'm concerned.<p>I think there's the possibility that project owners may start to delete forks and create entirely new repos when the bit rot issue starts to affect the repo they originally forked from. This has it's own set of problems and I might be a little too optimistic but I happen to think there's a chance we'll take matters into our own hands on that issue. Also, I would venture to guess that abandoned projects probably weren't so great to begin with and maybe the bitrot issue won't affect them as much? Like node.js isn't likely to go away and if it or a popular project like it is abandoned the authors would probably announce it and add it to the readme and so everyone will know to start looking at forks over the original.<p>Anyway, the HN community obviously thought this was important or good enough to be on the front page so you must have done something right. I'm sure if you were really rambling you'd just be lost in the ""new"" section. I don't always agree with what gets on the front page and I didn't agree with this being there at first either but now I'm starting to come around.",1322348360

The Scottish government is trumpeting this as a recognition of Scotland's ""highly skilled workforce"".  Actually it's 750 jobs (gov't estimate) mostly on 1% above the legal minimum wage, with no real prospects.<p>And to cap it all, Amazon don't even pay tax in the UK.  All their sales go through a Luxembourg company.  So it seems ridiculous that the taxpayer is subsidising the operations of a highly profitable, tax-avoiding company.  Effectively we're buying jobs.<p>Meanwhile, Borders is bankrupt (loss of 1,200 jobs), and other booksellers (Waterstones paid 2m in corporation tax last year) are struggling.<p>Relating it back to this post - highly skilled work requires less people.  Low skilled work requires less people AND pays less money.  But it's progress, and I fear it's simply an economic reality.  I don't know what the solution is.<p>Note: I don't want to litter this post with climbdowns, moderations etc.  I'm not disparaging Amazon jobs, and 750 people working instead of unemployed is good.  But we can't win in a race to the lowest paid unskilled labour.  And Amazon's labour can't even be offshored anyway, so who are we bidding against?",1322348200

3280952,comment,3280494,3280677,6,0,sounds,,,"Here are a few questions I wish yosefk.com would address:<p>1. Why do small companies exist? This is vice versa to his question, ""Why do large firms exist?"" -- if large companies have the advantage in eliminating transaction costs, small companies should be eliminated in favor of medium and large companies. (I'm taking into account Coase's ""decreasing returns to the entrepreneur function."")<p>2. Is it possible small companies are more efficient at solving some problems -- and large companies others? For example, a large company should be better at, oh, say, contracting with the Department of Transportation for major freeway construction projects. I guess what I'm saying is: there may be an ""endgame"" where small companies dominate large companies (or the other way around) -- but in the here and now there's plenty of room for both. Evidenced by the fact that both types are still around, with no apparent trend eliminating either.<p>3. Are there any good reasons stated in the article or the Coase theorem that _<i>don't</i>_ involve intellectual property, for big companies to exist? (I can think of a few, but I want to hear what others have to say.) Intellectual property is so polarizing, and I'd prefer to think about Coase Theorem in different terms than it's phrased by yosefk.com.<p>I actually think the Coase Theorem does have the ability to predict economic outcomes, but remember that econ isn't usually about perfect predictions anyway. Econ is usually about identifying a better way to eliminate inefficiencies -- a knob to tweak, or a strategy, etc.",1322347889

Everyone who likes the idea of making their homes more beautiful and their outfits nicer is liable to find that idea appealing. And it's ""selfishly social"", which is important for retaining users; it's useful to use just by yourself, and then even better with other people.<p>Another important part of Pinterest is that it's both very flattering to each user and intensely aspirational - when you use it, you get the feeling of ""Look at what great taste I have! I want to make cakes as lovely as these, I want to live in a house as wonderful as this one, I want to have a wedding this beautiful; maybe someday I will, thanks to these ideas cataloged on my Pinterest boards."" (But I actually get frustrated with the aspirational prettiness of most Pinterest pins; I like messy homemade things, strange things, things from normal people along with things from professionals.

If there are only 2 or 3 forks I can check them all, but more is impractical.<p>When I put stuff on github myself I often lose interest in the software, but someone was nice enough to fork the project and keep working on it. Unfortunately my project will still always be displayed as the most important version.<p>Some software developers have decided to create a shared account (or, since Github now supports this too, an ""Organization"") to prevent this problem (see for example github.com/ruby/). When one developer decides to leave the Ruby developement team, he is simply removed from the shared account/organization, but the project URL stays the same.",1322346808

These inbalances took a form that is perceived as overspending, but that is a much too simplistic view.<p>The economic problems of US are a <i>lot</i> less severe than those in the Euro area, precisely because US has a different way of equalizing bad balance between regions - namely taxes and federal spending.

The main purpose of them was to: 1) reduce outstanding debt in real terms by in effect soft-defaulting; and 2) increase competitiveness by cutting domestic wages in real terms, without having to cut nominal wages, which are extremely sticky.<p>Greece is currently at least suffering from the inability to do #2: it would be ideal for Greece for the Eurozone to be running higher inflation rates, which, if nominal pay was held constant (as it currently has to be under their agreements), would in effect cut the pay of Greek employees (and their pensions) without having to cut it in nominal terms, as well as bring down the real prices of all sorts of other things like housing. The only alternative way of accomplishing that is significant, sustained domestic deflation in the form of actual nominal price/wage cuts, which is more difficult to pull off in a way that doesn't completely wreck the economy.",1322345568

3280841,comment,3280592,3280592,19,0,potatolicious,,,"The US really needs to emulate other countries here.<p>The problem here is that the ""immigrant"" visa is really the same thing as a work visa, and that leads to a great deal of abuse.<p>For one thing, the eligibility is tied to an employer, who is incentivized to embellish, cheat, and otherwise finagle their way to a visa. The expectation that the visa is <i>temporary</i> also sets a lower bar for entry - even though many of these people will eventually become American PRs/citizens.<p>The recent trend to ""stage"" the H-1B green card process is a step in the right direction - though it doesn't go as far as it needs to. There is still a major problem of indentured servitude. Once an employee has a green card process in the pipeline their employer has them over a barrel - and many will not hesitate to use this as an opportunity for abuse.<p>Not to mention, with the green card backlog the way it is now, it would be years before ""your huddled masses of immigrant entrepreneurs yearning to breathe free"" are actually <i>able</i> to start businesses. First they have to go through ~8-10 years as a rank and file employee, before they're granted the legal freedom to pursue their own future. The startup visa would go a long way to alleviating that, though the heavy involvement of VCs in that initiative will mean that bootstrappers and other scrappy startups that <i>don't</i> want to raise hojillions in funding will be still at a severe disadvantage.<p>How do you fix this? IMO the US needs to setup a track for immigrants to <i>immediately</i> receive green cards, where having a job offer is <i>not</i> a prerequisite (though it would certainly help). The focus needs to shift away from fulfilling ""temporary shortages"" (which we all know is bullshit) to simply permanent, mass importation of worthy talent. Set up the process to filter people based on the assumption that they will permanently stay, as opposed the the current process where we'll let just about anyone in, since they're ""temporary"" H-1Bs anyways. This will raise the calibre of people you're letting in, and also make sure you're giving top talent maximum freedom once they're here. The whole ""immigration policy masquerading as work permit"" thing <i>really</i> needs to GTFO.",1322345246

Not whether or not we get more purchasing power than ever before. Not whether or not our lifestyle is more fulfilling than ever before. Jobs. More jobs. Less jobs. More competitive Americans. No manufacturing jobs. Colleges not creating enough people to fill jobs. Robots are destroying our jobs. Robots need to be maintain by something or someone, probably another robot or human being.<p>But jobs are just proxy. A proxy for our self-worth, our independence, or whether or not we have a future. Jobs, for us, are just means to an end. Yes, some of us are musicians, football players, programmers, scientists, etc. We like our jobs. I suspect the vast majority of humans don't really enjoy all that much working their job.<p>Rather than talking about creating jobs and destroying jobs, which is an assumption that exists in a world where there are scarcity and there's boring things to do for humans to maintain their existence, why not talk about the end, what should our goal be in life? We can then rearrange our actions in life based on our conclusion what our life should be and what we want to achieve rather than just simply on what needed to be done at this point in time.<p>After all, if a strong FAI comes, we may not even have jobs. At the same time, we ought to figure out what's our life purpose other than going to a job and work for someone or operating a business just to simply maintain our existence. There's no longer a need to grow your food, goes to the hair saloon to cut someone's hair, pump the gas, etc. How are we going to live for the next 10,000 years and 10,000 years beyond that and so on?",1322345203

I guess it's like any other hobby, and I guess the belief that the best technology out there will result in the best output, and that's what makes Silicon Valley what it is.<p>It's really a shame that photographers are not out-there on the streets taking photos of places and people that do matter, documenting every day life.<p>For example I bought this photo (<a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L3tT3HbZcsU/TeAwqf6XyxI/AAAAAAAAAfg/ZxKFtdPMCog/s1600/azil_de_noapte.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L3tT3HbZcsU/TeAwqf6XyxI/AAAAAAAAAf...</a>) for 15 Euros a couple of months ago from an antique bookstore. It was taken in Bucharest in the late 1930s' in front of a night asylum, by Jewish photographer Teddy Brauner (the brother of the better known Victor Brauner), using a normal Kodak camera and probably not thinking too much about aperture or light or any things like that. He just knew to be at the right place and to catch the right moment.<p>I cannot see this kind of work being done by today's photographers in America. I mean, I'm sure that there are people out-there documenting the worst recession in the last 80 years, but judging by what gets promoted on Google+ as being ""state of the art photography"" it seems like America's problems would be solved by taking photos of nice sunsets and beautiful mountains. There's a great opportunity for us people who like to take photos to help the others around us make sense of what's happening, but it seems we're more interested in technicalities and in kitsch photo-art.<p>(if anyone's interested to learn more about Teddy Brauner, I could only find this NY Times article about his later work: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/05/arts/photography-review-an-alchemist-s-pride-and-joy-in-a-gallery-setting-at-last.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/05/arts/photography-review-an...</a>.

I found that I could be satisfied, even happy, with changing my expectations.<p>My depression is fueled by having very high expectations for myself and then not achieving those. I must admit that I don&#x27;t always know what&#x27;s best for myself, and I&#x27;m willing to admit that these expectations are delusions of grandeur.<p>It helps me to think of where I stand in relation to every other living person on this planet, instead of comparing myself to Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk. I&#x27;m not basing this on real data, but I would guess that most people in this world don&#x27;t know what Boolean logic is (or care). There are many people who struggle to find clean drinking water for the day, who probably won&#x27;t eat today (again), and who hear about &quot;the internet&quot; like it&#x27;s a mystical land.<p>You are not a failure at life.

A block of 40 PowerPC instructions may take 40 clock cycles to run on a PowerPC Processor, but 120 clock cycles to run on an x86 processor once they&#x27;re blindly emulated. Programmers (and compilers) will change the type of instructions they&#x27;re using to best fit the situation and the instruction set they will be using.<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem where PowerPC is big endian and x86 is little endian so add potentially additional processing for network and file system code as well (models, textures, sounds, etc), in addition to any magic numbers[0] that may be used in the codebase.<p>While it is possible to emulate, the performance would be abysmal. Just take a look at GameBoy emulators for the PC. They use massive amounts of CPU due to the necessary overhead to emulate the processor, graphics, sound, etc. Trying to play a game like Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto emulated from PPC to x86 would just be sluggish at best.<p>[0]<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)</a>",1389491621

They’ve been around, virtually unchanged, for several hundreds years. They are an absolutely gigantic pain in the ass to play- they haven’t got any frets, they have tiny fingerboards designed to be played by scrawny, malnourished 15th century musicians. They’ve got tuning pegs designed for strings made out of animal guts and which rely on friction alone to stay in tune. They’re freaking baroque. And yet, they get played a lot. You might argue that their design actually encourages mistakes.<p>I wish people wouldn&#x27;t make analogies about things they don&#x27;t understand.  Frets do not make string instruments automatically better, in fact they limit you in terms of intonation and vibrato.  The fingerboards are exactly the size they need to be, and would be less ergonomic if they were simply made wider (every attempt at an ergonomic violin I&#x27;ve seen has involved changing the body shape to make it easier to hold, not widening the neck.  Widening the neck substantially on a bass would just be completely unhelpful) and a lot harder to bow.  Friction pegs were certainly designed for gut strings, and that&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll find geared tuners on many instruments that use steel strings (and sometimes even on ones that use guts).<p>I just find it funny that he doesn&#x27;t like it when people who don&#x27;t understand Go try to criticize it, and then criticizes something he doesn&#x27;t understand in an effort to strengthen his argument.",1389490161

I&#x27;ve long been confused why large open source projects aren&#x27;t, by default, providing a virtual system that is capable of building the project with close to no configuration. There is some discussion on the linked bug 885777 (and links out from there) about why current builds are not idempotent on a given system, and building a Vagrantfile to setup a build environment.<p>Even ignoring the verifiable build aspect, which I think is important, having an easy to start with environment to use as a launching pad, and more importantly, example build environment, would ease new developers into the process of making a commit. A little more than a year ago, I started toying around with the idea of commiting to Mozilla late one night when bored. I went through the process of getting dependencies installed (build-dep wasn&#x27;t enough as it didn&#x27;t provide the necessary version of autoconf), and even passing a ./configuration, the build failed and I gave up. I would have likely powered through if I already had a bug fix to commit, but as mentioned I was just idling playing around with the idea while bored.",1389489502

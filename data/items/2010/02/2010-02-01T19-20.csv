Industrial psychology and HCI are traditionally very big on data-driven design for interaction design, with a big focus on Methodologies, quantitative measurement of task performance improvement, and various other statistical evaluation metrics. But the main downside of that is that you can't really answer open-ended design questions: you can A/B test between two specific proposed interfaces, and determine A causes N% of users X quantity less hassle than B does (or whatever your metric is), but if you want to invent an entire new interface, you're basically doing a random walk in design space, which will take a really long time to get anywhere. I mean, imagine how many A/B questions you'd have to ask to invent the Gmail interface, using, say, the Hotmail interface as your starting point, and having to justify every change you make from that starting point using data.<p>I suppose it depends on your norm, though--- Google is very data-driven by the web-design standard, but sort of loosey-goosey, anything-goes compared to the much more statistics-and-methodology-heavy design practices that go on in traditional engineering and HCI.",1265053738

The former actually improves safety - most accidents are caused by speed <i>differences</i> between vehicles, not absolute speed.  The latter is a good way to kill someone or get killed.<p>And in my experience most traffic enforcement seems to be against the latter kind of behavior.  (Well, except the cops who sit at the bottom of a hill where the speed limit drops from 35 to 25, because their town needs revenue.)  I've never known someone to get pulled over for speeding when they're driving traffic speed on a highway, even if there's a cop right behind them.  I think people should and do get pulled over if they're weaving or blindly zooming through red lights.<p>Isn't it interesting that something as clear cut as <i>traffic laws</i> could spawn such a debate?

So I want to ask you this: do you think there is a potential win win scenario in advertising? And if there is, why do you think Google would pursue the advertiser favorable outcome over the both party win outcome?<p>Example time<p>---------------------------------------<p>Ok let's take the Google search example for a ride.
I'm looking for a new pair of headphones. They must be closed, really good quality, and nice looking. I want a good price. But most importantly, they must have favorable reviews. I've spent a few days searching google for reviews and specifications. I've settled on the Shure SRH840 (can't wait for them to get here).<p>From Shure's perspective, let's see if they could see exactly what I searched for! They would see exactly what I wanted based on the reviews. Then they could decide whether or not their products matched exactly what I'm looking for. Wouldn't Shure be interested in paying to put their headphone, along with all the information I was looking, right in front of my eyes? That would be a win win situation. I save myself some time researching, and Shure makes some money off of me.<p>---------------------------------------<p>(How do you type an asterisk?) Please note that in a real world application Shure would not see what I searched for. Instead they would target by telling google what type of people looking for such and such information would want Shure stuff.<p>But unfortunately advertising has not reached that ideal point yet. There are advertisers who have shitty products that barely function, and they try to target uneducated people. This could be an example of good targeting too, because the advertiser can reach its intended target: the idiot. Unfortunately because of the inefficiencies of ad targeting systems, we have people like you and me who are mistaken for <i>idiots</i> (at least I'm hoping it's a mistake) and served these ads for shitty ass products that we don't want. These targeting inefficiencies add noise to the system and not only serve us unwanted ads, but block the wanted ads. They also make advertising less attractive for people who have  genuinely good products that could potentially be exactly what some people want.<p>It's understandable that you and most people hate ads because they've been quite inefficient. And so far advertiser's haven't been able to target to the point of relevancy. Instead they employ a brute force method of either spamming the masses (television) or minimal targeting and slightly less spamming (Google ads). But I believe there <i>is</i> a place for ads to be beneficial by letting companies pay to get favorable information to a target audience, and I believe Google is trying to achieve <i>that</i>.",1265053443

Thus, a corporate format facilitates sophisticated ways by which people can own and do things through concerted efforts, by which they can transfer their ownership interests or borrow against them while putting them up as collateral, by which they can divide management from ownership such that an enterprise can be owned by broad numbers of passive investors while being managed by (supposedly) expert executives, etc.<p>If corporations are so sanctioned, they must be given at least some enforceable rights by which they can legally protect and promote their interests (e.g., the right to sue).  Were they denied such rights, then the only way, for example, that a corporate entity could sue to collect a debt would be for the lawsuit to be filed in the several names of the owners - a clearly unworkable way to proceed for any organization that becomes much more than a family-owned entity. Thus, the law creates what it clearly recognizes as a fiction and gives rights to the entities to act in their own names. The label put on this fiction is that of a ""legal person"" - that is, one that the law knows is not a living, breathing human being but that the law treats as having rights similar to those held by real individuals for the limited purposes for which this is needed.<p>As it does this sort of thing, the law does not treat corporations like individuals but only as ""legal persons"" insofar as that fiction is needed to give the entity rights consistent with its nature. But those rights certainly must include some of the constitutional rights that are needed to prevent the entity from having its property arbitrarily confiscated or its premises arbitrarily searched, etc., and that is why the law has always recognized such rights on behalf of the fictional ""persons"" it protects.<p>In other words, I think the law already does adapt the nature of the rights recognized to the nature of the ""person"" being protected and it is not therefore all or nothing (corporations cannot vote, for instance).<p>In theory, this ""legal-personhood"" method of protecting corporate rights could be scrapped in favor of another that did not call them ""persons"" but I think this would be a distinction without a difference as the goal of the law would remain trying to accord rights to legally-sanctioned entities consistent with their nature and nothing more.",1265051194

It is esoteric and often cross-domain knowledge<p>3. It has limited usefulness to understand if the magic is not broken.<p>For instance, Ruby on Rails is great except when it isn't, and it's broken. Then it's hell to figure out the source of the issue (this was from a couple years ago, haven't touched it in years). But does fixing RoR really yield you anything of value? Eh, not for most Rails users, beyond not breaking that specific way again.<p>I'd ALSO contend deep filesystem work is also esoteric and outside many peoples' knowledge, but it's <i>NOT</i> magic, because it very very very rarely breaks (for the use cases normal people have with it). So programmer X can go do his PHP, and will likely go his entire life without being bit by ""filesystem esoteric failure"" if he doesn't get tricky with his mounting of filesystems.<p>For a EE who sometimes programs (sounds like you, sorry if I misconstrue you), I would agree recursion is somewhat magical.<p>For someone like me (I learned to repeat with recursion before I learned loops), it isn't esoteric at all, and is just a better way of expressing repetition in some cases. I have little more trouble debugging a recursive algorithm than a iterative one.<p>Due to the limited stack sizes on most embedded systems, I'd actually contend this falls into the ""cross-domain"" knowledge for you, as the skillset and familiarity with recursive algorithms is simply using them lots of times in places where it's acceptable and proper.<p>I don't see your vocation giving you that practice, as embedded developers are often highly suspicious of recursion (even tail recursion). [Disclosure: I am an embedded developer by later training, but have a computer science degree with a specialization in embedded and large scale systems].<p>So what's magic to you isn't magic to everyone. Magic is just a way of saying ""Complex, can break but usually doesn't, not worth learning about that next layer down, but useful anyhow"".

1093117,comment,1092744,1092896,0,0,olefoo,,,"Nope. Sorry. Don't buy it. This is not Amazon playing some deep game to drive the ebook market in directions that it wants. This was very plainly a screwup of epic proportions. I don't know enough about Amazon's internal structure or politics to finger a name but this does have the earmarks of an overreaching junior executive who was high on the idea that ""hey we're Amazon, the 800lb gorilla, and we can call the shots and make publishers dance like monkeys.""  It may have been a group rather than an individual, but if this was an agreed upon action at the highest levels of Amazon... I'd say sell AMZN. Because that sort of hubris in management leads to bad decisions.<p>And think about what message this sends to other Amazon customers and suppliers. Would Amazon boot your startup off AWS if they decided you were serious competition? Would you want to bet your company on that?",1265050890

Effectively, Web Search directs viewers straight to the original website, while News lets them just <i>browse</i> Google News, sending less traffic to the original website. [1]<p>Which means Google News may provide less ad revenue to original website -- probably the crux of the problem here.<p>To handle that, Google provides two different bots: one with user agent `Googlebot', the other with `Googlebot-News'. If a website wants its content only in Web Search, and not in News, it's supposed to return proper /robots.txt -- and that does the trick. Way quicker and cheaper than any lawsuit!<p><a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/12/new-user-agent-for-news.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/12/new-user-...</a><p>----<p>[1] but hey, less is more! whoever makes it to the original site via Google News has clearly show elevated interest in the news piece, and thus should be worth more to ad providers.",1311001193

(In Japanese: )<p>One of the other aspects of software vs. hardware is that hardware is relatively easier to debug than most software environments. You will find that easy to debug environments like consoles have many software developers. This is important because the Japanese are very risk-adverse. Making claims on others and keeping everyone/everything in check is a big part of life in Japan.<p>Finally, programming is considered more of an engineer's profession than a creative profession. Engineering is seen as directly applying nature's laws into practice and as such, the approach is one of: ""if you want to say build a bridge then you may choose from these designs that we already know are best""<p>Programming in Japan follows this cookie-cutter model and although there are very bright, creative engineers and programmers in Japan, the schooling system is very rigid.",1311001096

Here, we have uniq event dispatch, and extensible motion event that deliver all the data he can deliver (position, angle, acceleration, image...). It's called profile, and a motion event can deliver information according to one or more profile. For example, the mouse will fill properties of the ""pos"" profile, instead of Wacom tablet that will fill ""pos"", ""pressure"", or even TUIO with fiducials object that will fill ""markerid"" and ""angle"".
Then you can do specific interaction or filter specific motion event according the profiles delivered in the current touch.<p>All the widgets are made using that approach, make it possible multiple interactions at the same time.<p>Not sure if it'm 100% clear, best is to read & try :)",1311000115

I've yet to see more than a handful of people search out places of opportunity targeted at raising flourishing children, as opposed to seeking out economic opportunity.  Raising flourishing children requires a community with good social capital, amongst other things --- money is only one, small contribution, and it is possible to make flourishing communities and children without much money.  When I saw the headline about a global kid, I at first thought along these lines, since American society sucks at the pursuit of happiness and human flourishing (despite the propaganda to the contrary) --- and so it makes sense to move to another country/culture for a better social fabric.",1310999327

2776386,comment,2776011,2776011,6,0,maguay,,,"There's one thing about it: growing up global does make you see the world different. I'm a Caucasian, English-speaking American, but have lived in Thailand since I was 11. My parents were missionaries, and while we were far from wealthy, we did get to see many of the countries around Thailand due to travels for visas and more. And, of course, we grew up bilingual, never thinking it was odd for others to speak a different language, have different customs or ideas, or eat different foods. Perhaps best of all, we <i>weren't</i> in an elite part of the country full of foreigners, but we lived right in a neighborhood of normal Thais.<p>And it does make you see the world different. I'm always amazed how much most other Americans see the world as American-centric, and even seeing logos with a globe with the US front and center seem odd to me now. Economics and business classes have been much easier, since the ideas of foreign exchange, international law, and more were a part of everyday life. And speaking a second language as close to fluent as you can is a huge asset, and makes you analyze why you think what you do and why language and society work the way they do in a huge way.<p>Perhaps sadly, experiencing prejudice from others while being the minority in another country also helps you see the evils of disliking someone because of their language, the way they were educated or raised, their skin color, nationality, or anything else. That in itself can make you a much better person. This won't be the same everywhere, but I've experience enough of it to make my blood boil when I hear racist remarks against others in the US.<p>Living abroad is not for everyone, but I do think more people growing up with a global perspective would be a very good thing. You can do it right where you live, though. There are ethnic communities all around the world, and the internet brings content of every language to your living room. Raise your children to see diversity as normal, and make sure they know that they're not any different than someone from any other part of the world just because of where they were born, the language they speak, and the color of their hair. Help them see that they can make a difference in the world, and are not limited to jobs or lifestyles in their own community.<p>If more people were raised like that, the world would definitely be a better place.",1310998787

In particular, it is important to explain why some JVM languages work and others do not.  Some of the more detailed discussion will likely end up in an appendix.<p>I'll have to think about your idea to include networking synchronization.  The tricky part with that is exactly how to implement it.  Off-hand, there are two basic approaches: server/client and peer-to-peer.  The problem with server/client is that either I have to choose someone else's platform as a server or provide a server (either as a service or as an included program you can run from a home computer).  The alternative is to use something like Bluetooth or NFC to allow synchronization between two devices.<p>The second issue that I need to figure out is exactly how much material to present.  There are some absolutely necessary basics such as activities, services, and resources.  Beyond that, there is a question of which platform features are most important.  Certainly, something like location is more important than NFC, but deciding on what to include won't be easy.",1310997867

Globals make total sense to newbies, and avoiding them is not hard if you're not a newbie.<p>(HyperTalk, if I recall correctly, had local variables by default and global variables explicitly, and was -- I think -- even more newbie friendly than JavaScript, so it's possible that JavaScript might have thrived.)<p>It's not like coding in ActionScript is noticeably more pleasant than coding in JavaScript despite being controlled by a single vendor.

There are certainly pure Ruby and Python shops that exist now.  Hell, there's even a Common Lisp shop in Boston (ITA).  However, you'll find it difficult to get away with not knowing Java and/or C++.<p>The next big thing in software is the same thing is was 15 years ago: knowing how to program well.  This is no easy task.  Focus on doing this and don't worry about the language.   It's far easier to learn a new language than it is learning how to be a great programmer.  For a starting point see: <a href=""http://norvig.com/21-days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a>.<p>(The only thing I would add to that is that knowing how to program parallel and concurrent programs is pretty important.

That said, calling it ""pep talk bullshit"" was an emotional response - it's been a long day. What I mean to say is that Taleb is giving bad advice with a lot of confidence and bad ""proofs"" based on idiotically simple models. For example:<p><i>Taleb says is to do things that will reward you if the unpredictable happens</i><p>That sentence seems to either (a) have a huge gap of basic probability, or (b) contradict itself.<p>First, if ""unpredictable"" is to mean ""low probability of happening"", there are several orders of magnitude more ""unpredictable"" things than ""predictable"" ones (and that's why they have such a low probability of happening).<p>A better model of ""events"" and ""probability"" would consider the key variable correlating to <i>probability</i> of events is specificity - it's highly probable that some planes will crash in the next 10 years. That relatively general event can be partitioned into less probable (but more specific) events. There are more specific events than general events, and each is less probable in proportion to its specificity. If you could know which unpredictable thing were going to happen, they wouldn't be unpredictable anymore.<p>Of course, reality is stranger yet - events aren't all neat subsets and partitions of each other like they are in that model, and <i>predictable</i> varies with <i>probable</i> based on some measure of the accuracy of the world model of the <i>predictor</i> (which, I would argue, is usually pretty bad).

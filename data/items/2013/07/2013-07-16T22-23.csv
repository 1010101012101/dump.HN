If those in charge were worried primarily about national security, they would have let him run to a normal country like Finland or Chile or New Zealand, where Snowden could have been observed reliably. If he ever progressed from criticism of domestic surveillance to active assistance of rogue states, the host nation could have brought its own charges.<p>That those in charge didn&#x27;t allow this tells us one of two things: A) they&#x27;re really not very good at their jobs or B) their primary concern is not Snowden revealing secrets which will harm the USA, but rather secrets that will harm their own careers.

I started as just a web UI developer, but soon helped design the deployment architecture of our entire runtime system and throughout my tenure I designed and implemented many of the services within that architecture. That included everything from DB schemas, custom XML databases, authentication servers, several mid-tier servers/services, as well as always being the lead owner of the UI.<p>What helped, I think, is that I was part of a small team in that big company. At peak we probably had about two dozen programmers, with 8-10 on my team.

Never stop learning, never stop broadening your skillset.

Hi
We are E-sign.co.uk and we have produced a unique and secure method to signing documentation digitally via a QR code.
Each signature on e-Sign is generated a unique identifier (a long random hash of letters/digits) which is embedded in a URL for accessing the information about the signatory and the document. When you view the Signed Document PDF on computer/phone/tablet, you can simply click the QR Code which will take you to the relevant signature page on our site. But if you had a hardcopy, you would have to manually type in the long url with the unique identifier.
With a QR Code scanner you don&#x27;t have to do that. At some stage we will be releasing an e-Sign app for mobiles which will have an integrated QR Code Scanner. But there are lots of QR Code reading apps for smartphones available now and all will work with our QR Codes.
We are currently at our beta stage but are on verge of going live so as of now, you can register and use our services free of charge to see what you think.
All feedback in greatly appreciated.",1374015054
6055249,comment,6054073,6055045,3,0,samstave,,,"I agree on pretty much all points - and wanted to add why I think Dropbox for teams is a horrible, horrible thing - well sharing anything on dropbox is actually bad.<p>First, one typically has a private dropbox that they keep a bunch of stuff in. When one joins a company that is using dropbox for teams - it cuts off access to your personal dropbox, and whenever the company has rule over your account - if you leave the company, lets say abruptly, you can lose access to your data.<p>I don&#x27;t care what anyone says about any employment relationship - there is some data that is private and crucial, and you should never save any of it in a shared team dropbox.<p>Finally, sharing things with people via dropbox is a stupid and inefficient way of handling sharing; Assume you have a paid 50-100GB Dropbox. Storing large files/data in there is no-issue. Sometimes you&#x27;ll want to share out a project directory with another user - but they may not be a paid dropbox user. If they join your shared folder, that data gets replicated to them and they get that data deducted from their available space. So, dropbox is &quot;counting&quot; the space for that data on both accounts. If that other user has a small or mostly full account - that project share could bring them to their cap.<p>This happened to people I shared data with on large projects many many times.<p>If I share out a folder from me to you - and you join my share - you should get a free connection to that share, as it is using data from my account limit, not yours.",1374015054

While only a single sperm will actually fertilize the egg, a single lone sperm is not capable of accomplishing the task. The ovum has a layer of protection that prevents access. Sperm cells, in turn, have some sort of enzyme payload that breaks down this barrier. It takes a lot of this enzyme before the barrier is weakened enough for a sperm to gain access. Not enough sperm, no one&#x27;s getting through.<p>Additionally, the female reproductive tract is generally a hostile environment. This is by design, in order to weed out sperm cells with defects. Since this is a biological system, you&#x27;re going to have some variation and some females are going to have a lower sperm survival rate than others. I have no idea what the range is, but I would be entirely unsurprised to learn the variation spreads over several orders of magnitude.",1374014783

Gordon Moore:<p>>Ah, one of the questions that has come out of a number of lawsuits as of recently, that here on the west coast, in silicon valley, we didn&#x27;t patent circuit designs or Computer Aided Design for that matter. And as a result, we never patented at Fairchild the ROM and the RAM. Intel never patented the microprocessor... and others did. East coast companies or TI in particular, took our work and patented it. How come we never recognized the importance of that... circuit development?<p>>Well, it was probably a different attitude about patents. One thing that happened in the semiconductor industry... semiconductor processes are a long series of steps and the patents had gotten pretty broadly spread because all of the people working on the technology had some of them. And the net result was in order for any of us to operate we had to be cross licensed so the participants tended to all cross, license one another. So, there was not a tremendous advantage to having more patents... with a couple of exceptions, there wasn&#x27;t much net benefit from it.<p>>What we never anticipated, I guess, was a lot of other participants were going to enter the business later on. So, at Fairchild we tended to patent relatively few things, typically the ones that we thought we could police most easily and were the most difficult to get around, you know, the more fundamental things. But, I was responsible for a lot of those decisions. I remember one in particular that, in retrospect, is kind of funny. In the early days of the integrated circuit, Bob Norman, one of the people who were involved there, suggested the idea of semiconductor memory... the whole idea of how semiconductorflip- flops could be used as a memory structure, and I decided it was so economically ridiculous, it didn&#x27;t make any sense to file a patent on it.<p>>You recognize that a few years later, semiconductor memory was the basis of...<p>>Of Intel.<p><a href=""http://silicongenesis.stanford.edu/transcripts/chronicles.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://silicongenesis.stanford.edu/transcripts/chronicles.ht...</a>",1374014666

6055096,comment,6024383,6036870,1,0,ars,,,"> You also need feedstocks.<p>You can use wood, coal, or CO2 from the air. The carbon from all the stuff we burned didn&#x27;t go away, it&#x27;s all still here. Most of it is in the ocean or in plants.<p>If you &quot;extended&quot; coal by adding hydrogen then you can quintuple the energy content (since each atom of carbon gets 4 of hydrogen, for longer chain hydrocarbons the ratio is less, but at a minimum it&#x27;s tripled). So instead of the estimated 100 years of coal we now have, we&#x27;d have 500 years.<p>And on top of that most of the coal is used for electrical production (with the rest of steel making), if we stopped doing that and used nuclear power for electricity and saved the coal to make liquid fuel we would have at least 10,000 years of coal left.<p>> Conventional non-breeder uranium reactors will suffer from fuel shortages if used for significant amounts of power generation well within a century. Thorium breeders offer a possible alternative, though the technology is unproven.<p>So don&#x27;t use non-breeder and switch to breeders. I once calculated that if we used breeding reactors, plus thorium, we have enough energy in those two elements alone for 10,000 to 100,000 years! (The range is because energy consumption will inevitably go up.)<p>So no, energy is NOT the problem. We have enough for longer than recorded history.<p>> On top of that, Fischer-Tropsch plant and capital are expensive and would take a long time and vast investments (trillions of dollars) to replace the 20 million barrels of oil consumed daily in the US.<p>Sure. But have you seen the unbelievable size of the equipment used today for petroleum production? If there was demand for these fuels, it would get built. No problem at all. No one is expecting this to happen overnight - I think it would take 20 to 50 years.<p>> You&#x27;re side-stepping your original statement. Producing hydrocarbons at that scale from electricity is unproven.<p>Of course it&#x27;s proven. And you don&#x27;t make it from electricity, you make it directly from heat. The only reason it&#x27;s not done right now is that it&#x27;s not needed. But the technology is there.<p>> Producing hydrogen might work<p>?? Why would this work if producing hydrocarbons won&#x27;t? You could make hydrogen the same way - by heating water. But hydrogen is extremely hard to transport or store. It leaks right through everything, and damages most metals if stored under pressure. You need special materials to store hydrogen, and those are expensive and not plentiful. Hydrogen is not the fuel of the future - methane is.<p>> My point was to demonstrate that where solar powered heavier-than-air craft are only just feasible<p>If I&#x27;m understanding you right, your argument is that we won&#x27;t be able to fly anymore because we&#x27;ll run out of energy (or fuel), and your proof is that solar powered airships are only just barely workable.<p>You mistake is a: thinking that we&#x27;ll run out of energy, and we won&#x27;t.

It doesn&#x27;t try to export much of Qt to Go, it basically expects you to write the UI logic in QML/QtQuick and then just use Go for the underlying app logic, using the QML plugin bridge to allow Go code to call QML functions and vice-versa.  In practice this works somewhat like writing a Go server that manages an HTML UI for doing browser-based UIs with a web-based RPC system, except I can write the UI code in QML which I find much preferable to HTML/JavaScript (variable binding Just Works, no need for frameworks like Angular, no need to mess with CSS, can efficiently pass around binary data in byte arrays easily, etc).<p>Currently my solution isn&#x27;t even half-baked, I&#x27;ve been implementing it to serve a specific app, and it currently has some dependencies that force it to be Windows only (these could be trivially removed, but doing so isn&#x27;t important for my app).

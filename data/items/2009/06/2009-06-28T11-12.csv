We're all (well, mostly) aware of the concept of hacker vs enterprise programmer, and this story doesn't add anything new to that idea.<p>On the other hand, it does seem to be a nice passive-aggressive way to complain about getting demoralised by a manager who couldn't understand the hacker mindset.",1246190021

Not Twitter's ""Suggested Users"" list, which mostly contains celebrities and companies.<p>There's a lot of metrics you could use:<p>* negative points for ""follow-baiting"", i.e. following hundreds or thousands of random users, hoping they'll follow you back, then unfollowing the people who don't follow you.<p>* number of user's Tweets favorited (normalized by number of followers?)<p>* average follower's rating. kind of like PageRank.<p>These are just a few off the top of my head.",1246188102

Here's a quote:<p><i>""The thing I asked for Christmas last year, those Teach12.com DVDs, the sad fact is that in their science area I now have all of their lectures. These things are brilliant. If you weren’t here to hear me enthused about that, these are not--  they’re kind of pricy, but these are brilliant science lectures. If you want to learn about-- if you want to understand how semiconductors work, get the lecture called 'Physics in your Everyday Life' and watch it. He will explain to you, better than I’ve ever seen explained, because I’ve always tried to explain to people how semiconductors work. If you want to know about geology, just get the geology course. If you want to know biology, you want to know string theory, you want to know anything, they’ve gone and found the very best lecturers in the world and they’re fantastic.<p>The problem is I’ve seen them all now. I’m going to go back and re-watch maybe about half of them, because they’re that fun and interesting.<p>Some of them-- my daughter is 11, my son is 8 -- some of them, like I got all their high school ones. Some of those are good enough I’ll get to watch with my kids and go through and see if they’re ready for them. So, I might have to think of something new. I’ve told them they should go get more lectures. There are some areas that they don’t cover very well. They don’t cover chemistry as well as they should. There’s actually nothing that’s really good on chemistry out there.""</i>",1246188052

The fundamental flaw in much of Dawkins work is his reliance on a biologically unrealistic definition of a ""gene"". Sure, if you go with his definition of genes then logic can tell you all sorts of things about evolution that aren't necessarily true.",1246187163

I speak from experience on this. It's a good story over a beer.<p>btw - Did you know the SEC is going to pass a rule that no longer considers people with $1M in assets ""rich"", they are changing the bar to $2.5M...this was in last week's wall st. journal.<p>This is a tough one to answer since I am committed to my idea, and while money is important I want to see it through.  To an investor though, their goals are to get out as soon as they can with as much as they can.  Obviously you can't have a $100M company in 3 months, but you could have something that gains A-round valuations from a VC.

And I don't mean in some abstract, ""pay with screen real-estate"" way - they pay with dollars.<p>Advertising models will result in users paying more for the advertisers' products, either by increasing volume or tolerating an increased price.  If it does not, the advertisers will stop advertising and the software will go away. And every other business model (go ahead!  Try me! :)  can be similarly reduced to money flowing from users' pockets to yours.<p>Choosing an advertising model is not a good fall-back strategy for a product idea that people won't pay for: it's useful only as an optimization strategy - that is, worth pursuing if the advertisers will pay <i>more</i> than the users. <p>But if you don't think people will pay real dollars for what you're building -- I say stop building it and go to a movie.",1174666810

At one of the sessions someone apparently mentioned that people should watch out for developers that call themselfs Web 2.0 developers. I pride myself being a web 2.0 developer and I was wondering what your thoughts are on what a web 2.0 developer is and why its a bad idea branding yourself as one. ",1174665612

7709653,comment,7708437,7709017,5,0,onetwofiveten,,,"Honestly, unless you have expensive hobbies you are passionate about, if you have enough money then you should shift your focus away from money and more towards finding happiness in your life.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with making lots of money, if you&#x27;re also happy with what you&#x27;re doing. But if you think you&#x27;d be happier doing something more worthwhile, then go for it. It doesn&#x27;t have to be medical research. You could work on developing tools that support scientific development - things like programming tools or machine learning technology. You can still make a lot of money in those areas. You don&#x27;t even have to focus on science, there is intrinsic value in politics, art, culture, education, communication, etc. Or sell everything, keep as much as you need to set yourself up doing something you enjoy and give the rest to cancer research.<p>Whatever you want to do, just making money for its own sake doesn&#x27;t make any sense from a pragmatic point of view.\nOnce you&#x27;ve ensured a stable modest lifestyle, extra money does not really increase your ability to enjoy life significantly. I am not very rich, but I have learned to cook, and I cook to my own tastes. So I get really great food every day.\nAlcohol is pretty cheap if that&#x27;s your pleasure. Drugs less so - but spending a lot of money on drugs is bad for you in the long term.\nHaving money helps attract sexual interest, but confidence and social skills work just as well. Money only helps get more frequent lower quality sex. High quality comes through deep mutual understanding and accommodation with you partner. You&#x27;re way better off spending time investing in personal development so you can learn to build good quality relationships.<p>The one thing money can reliably buy you is status. It&#x27;s very easy to cling to the notion that status has significant intrinsic value, but it doesn&#x27;t. Status doesn&#x27;t help you make friends or find love or solve your emotional problems or be happier. You might think having low status will make people ignore you or look down on you, but if you&#x27;re confident, if you believe in yourself as a smart guy, that will never happen. True self-belief renders status obsolete.<p>Money based status is ultimately just a social competition that some people care about and some people don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a shared obsession that means about as much as any other shared obsession. Your bank balance is like a high score on World of Warcraft. To some people it&#x27;s the most important thing to them. But, to those on the outside, it&#x27;s obvious that the obsession is unhealthy and adds little to the obsessed one&#x27;s life.",1399463687

Spending time with them, just doing &quot;stuff&quot; with them, even just talking or emailing, will help.  The funeral-industrial complex is heavily monetized and optimized for massive profit simulation of what you actually need.  So don&#x27;t expect that wearing a suit for two hours while paying multiple kilobucks will have much effect, or worry if it doesn&#x27;t.  Then again, however pitiful it is of a simulation of whats needed, funeral rituals do at least imply the right track, &quot;increased familial interaction&quot; for awhile seems to help quite a bit.  TLDR the funeral will be a waste of time and money, yet it is none the less sorta pointing in the correct direction, so whatever you normally do with your family, do more of it for a bit, you&#x27;ll feel better.<p>Also its your head, don&#x27;t let people tell you what it should be thinking, as long as its not hurting you.  So don&#x27;t sweat not following the grieving steps in the precise order for the correct amount of time at what they claim is the correct intensity.

But I think his approach is roughly the same in spirit--the translation from disassembly to C is pretty direct.  His tool has to track the stack, set flags for instructions that change them, and other things like that; my decompiler doesn&#x27;t bother with the stack at all (the ElectroPaint binary has no functions that spill arguments to stack and never adjusts the stack pointer within a function), and MIPS doesn&#x27;t have &quot;flags&quot; (ALU comparison results are just stored in a GPR, though floating point comparisons do have a flag--I think later MIPS versions have multiple condition FPU registers though). Both tools handle variable argument functions, and of course in order to do so you have to have special handling of each function--that&#x27;s why my decompiler has an entire parser just for printf and scanf...fortunately the only variable argument functions used by ep.  :)<p>I don&#x27;t know if or when I&#x27;ll have time for a Linux version, but I would love to see it made available for all OSes.

Typically, when people think of 501(c)(3)s, they think of organizations such as the Red Cross or Catholic Charities, but obviously (as with Mozilla or Wikipedia) it can be practically anything directed toward the public good.  One common critique I&#x27;ve heard about nonprofits in the tech space is that they have a hard time competing for the best talent (at least when it comes to salary/benefits), but if you have a large volunteer base, and a lot of people who truly want the project to flourish, then that&#x27;s not a critical problem.<p>Or, you might be talking about a cooperative.  A co-op is a non-profit in the sense that (unlike a normal for-profit business) its primary goal is not to make money, but to provide some benefit to its members.  So, in the case of a cooperative registrar (such as nic.coop), the members wholly own the registrar, and it exists for their benefit.

Sure.  Should have?  Not so fast.  Quite a few of those people had pointed out that the complexity and sheer ugliness of the OpenSSL code created a large unnecessary barrier to contribution, and that people&#x27;s time would be better spent on alternatives.  It would be very interesting to look at the use:contribution ratios over time for OpenSSL and e.g. PolarSSL, which also happens to be GPL-licensed.  Sometimes the people who made a mess bear primary responsibility for cleaning up, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with others saying so.  Bringing pressure to bear on the people who can actually make that kind of fundamental change might be more productive than submitting patches that have to be rejected because they&#x27;re based on wrong assumptions about complex code.<p>Now, if someone <i>from one of those freeloading companies</i> that have eschewed alternatives and continue to ship millions of copies of OpenSSL without contributing anything were to offer such criticism, that would be wrong.  It would be wrong not because it&#x27;s kibitzing from an outsider, but because it&#x27;s ingratitude from an insider.  That&#x27;s a different thing.  If contribution was always a precondition for comment, this would be a very quiet world.

The total cost is (base fee + usage fee). So it&#x27;s not purely based on consumed resource amount.<p>If we were to transition to a consumption based fee model to realign incentives, it would stand to reason that the amount of revenues the telcos should get should not change significantly. I expect that the telcos would not be able to resist gouging their customers if consumption based fees were to comeback (competition might drive down prices... eventually).<p>Water and electricity are quite cheap (in first world terms).

You don&#x27;t pay your electricity company based on the maximum number of amps that can flow down the wire, you pay for the electricity consumed.<p>Internet should be paid in bytes delivered. Then all the incentives will be aligned for all parties.<p>High usage end users pay for more of the network than low usage end users, which they should because they are the ones putting strain on it.<p>The ISPs would then prefer to transport the larger content that users demand because they will be paid more for it. Thus they are also incentivised to create more and better infrastructure to deliver it.",1399461061

Depression is the emptiness, the numbness of not feeling anything.<p>You don&#x27;t &quot;recover&quot; from the loss of a loved one. You don&#x27;t get back to where you were before. You don&#x27;t &quot;get over&quot; it, nor should you want to. Your life has changed and there is a big hole in it. But you do adjust to it. You do learn to cope with it and find a new way to live with it.<p>Sorry if that&#x27;s not uplifting, but it&#x27;s what I found.",1399460901

The guy is clearly grieving and depressed over what has happened, it&#x27;s not a hard thing to interpret, so why address him as if he&#x27;s failing to understand the logic in the situation? This isn&#x27;t a technical topic, I&#x27;d like to think there&#x27;s a capacity to switch gears and actually deal with people in a more complex way than &quot;death happens, this is sensible, get used to it&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t consider your response a flame - I&#x27;ve just worked with people who are in grief and shock before and would never consider responding with my own beliefs on the topic if I thought it would injure them during the initial stages of grieving. Yes, in the mainstream we don&#x27;t acknowledge it, and in the west we get people out of sight so they can die without us dealing with it, but it doesn&#x27;t mean people just pretend it away when it happens to them. Some people just choose to deal with the topic indirectly when talking in public forums or with people outside of the family but I&#x27;ve certainly known the majority of people I&#x27;ve worked with to be very direct about the topic when they feel like they are in the right situation to do so.<p>Again, it&#x27;s perfectly fine to have your own coping style but when you&#x27;re engaging with someone else on a subject like death there has to be some measure of empathy towards their situation. They are not you, they have different processes and philosophies towards these events, it&#x27;s not just a case of standing there and shouting your ideas at them until they &quot;understand&quot;.",1399460660

Taken literally, it could mean &quot;altered or affected the world in any amount.&quot; Going with such a strict definition, nearly everything changes the world.<p>The other extreme, the one people frequently have in mind, is &quot;to change or alter many parts of the world very directly&quot;, such as the invention of flight.<p>However, a better phrase for the feeling in developer circles I think would be &quot;touched the world.&quot; Doing so, with the internet, is easy.

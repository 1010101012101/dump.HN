160488,comment,160289,160471,0,0,yters,,,"People aren't analyzable by computers, at least on an individual basis.  Women tend to be more interested in individual relationships than men, and you can't have a relationship with a computer.<p>In my opinion, it is pretty obvious from the clearly differing motivations of the genders why there is such a gender divide in academics.  Maybe it has to do with intelligence, but ""intelligence"" seems to largely be determined by what a person loves and focuses their time on, i.e. genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.<p>Today, we measure intelligence in quantitative/technical terms, and men are much more interested in technical subjects than women.  Who memorizes thousands of intricate statistics about hundreds of people they'll never meet?  Who gets bored stiff by that stuff and wants to share personal experiences instead?  The difference here is quantitative vs qualitative.<p>So, again, I think it's pretty obvious why there are barely any women geeks.  People only think it is a big issue because they think it is important for women to be self determined, and you have to be technically smart to succeed in what we consider success (career, wealth, material goods, etc).

For starters, I've had to deal with a few of my classmates make lame jokes,like boobs and brains being an inverse ratio and following that up with ""Oh hey, you're not flat chested. Haha."" It's a no win situation for me. If I complain, I'm too sensitive. If I say something back, I'm a bitch. I've also had problems with one of my professors, who seemed think women only took CS classes because they were gold diggers in search of a MRS degree. Most of the guys in my classes are decent, if occasionally awkward when we do group projects together. But the ones who aren't tend to be the ones who go out of their way to be an ass.<p>I think the article nailed it with this quote: ""These roles would probably be ideal for women who prefer to be in communication-focused roles, if they know computer science and can communicate to all parties involved."" My husband and several of our friends work at the same company. They are write code. All the women on their floor are relegated to ""communication-focused"" roles, like project/product managers. I've also run into this when people at my husband's office ask what I'm majoring in. When I say computer science, everyone's reaction is ""Great! We could always use another project manager! You should talk to so and so about an internship."" They look sort of baffled when I explain that no, I want to write code, not manage coders.",1207871241

Basically, everything that used to return a list (e.g. range()) now returns an iterable, and to get a list you just apply the list() constructor to that. It's about lazy evaluation. So these will be equivalent:\ndinner = [eggs(x) for x in spam]\ndinner = list(eggs(x) for x in spam)\ndinner = list(map(eggs, spam)<p>The real reason list comprehensions are favored over map() and filter() are that the latter two require another Python function call, while list comprehensions are evaluated directly by the interpreter (a bit like rewriting the loop in C or using Pyrex) -- better performance.",1207871085

(studies show that psilocybin reduces symptoms of OCD for longer then a month).<p>4 A person has treatment resistant cluster headaches that stops them from thinking.  Their treatment provider informs them that their best bet is probably psychedelic mushrooms, which must be obtained illicitly.<p>5 A person has a psycho-spiritual crisis after finding out their religious leader is a fraud, and takes illicit LSD in the aftermath with confused and possibly self destructive intentions.

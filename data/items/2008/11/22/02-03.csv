Undoubtedly the marketing value (to Netflix) of the challenge is incredible, and I don't question the reasonableness of their desire to eke satisfaction out of every potentially satisfied customer; but surely there's somewhere else in their business they could more easily improve their margin and their customers' experience.<p>I, personally, use Netflix a bunch, and love the service. Furthermore, I love the fact that they sponsored this contest and provided a large research database to support it.  I guess I'm just always a bit disappointed by breathless mainstream press coverage that doesn't discuss these other meta-contest questions. That and I wish I could somehow get Netflix to send me season 4 of Lost before season 5 starts.",1227322597

Time zones are obviously a problem, but we can tell when most users are active from the logs, so if we went black for a few hours during that time we'd help the most people.<p>It seems worth at least trying.

Banks, mutual funds, and a dozen other easily accessible instruments willingly do that for you.<p>As for reduced taxes, I would argue that it seems like the ideal way to combat a global credit crunch. The government has the lowest cost of capital and the lowest default rate (at least the US govt. does). Thus it would be more efficient to leave the extra capital with private citizens and use deficit spending. Of course it would even more efficient to just not have the federal govt. spend as much but then its not like hell is about to freeze over anytime soon.",1227321226

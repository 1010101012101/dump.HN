Going diagonally up-right gives you whole tone steps, diagonally down-right gives you semitone steps. An octave is QT, a major triad is QSD, a minor triad is QWD, a major scale is QZSXDRVT or AWXECFTG or ASEDRVGB. I could pick this up right away, in some ways it&#x27;s easier than the piano, which I&#x27;ve played a lot. I really wish there was touch response, but computer keyboards don&#x27;t support it.<p>The behavior of cmd as the pedal is a little weird. When you release the pedal, the sound should stop. Maybe it&#x27;s just a Mac bug, though.<p>The top row seems to be an octave higher than it should be, that interferes with moveability. Though I understand you probably wanted to expand the range.",1408881468

Direct competitors to a real-estate platform: yes, many, as its &quot;only&quot; a platform. Expendable to what the market wants - speaking of more of a real-estate management software.<p>Doable up to this point in less than 400 hours? Probably not significantly less. A lot of time was running into the details: e.g. Import/export to and from other portals, looking into open formats around in Europe. Legal situation. What software has to be supported, etc... As always, theory and practice are two different things. One would pretty quickly find its boundaries if coming from the US and plan to do anything in the European markets. A clear advantage when doing something here from Austria, right in the heart of the EU. Except someone has millions to invest, then it doesn&#x27;t matter. Anyways.<p>So, basically, interesting for people who want to do something with real estates at the European markets. Who plan to extend the functionality and who are lacking the $200k+ seed money. Who do not have the time and the energy for extensive research on those markets.<p>the userbase: around 1k registered users (mainly estate agents) with around 1.5k active estates currently online. We clearly lacked of marketing, and the endurance to properly market the product. It was a naive idea at the beginning - no question to that - but lack of time, money and motivation let the whole thing fade away.",1408880158

But to play devil&#x27;s advocate, here are some arguments:<p>The reasons to oppose trafficking, under age prostitution and violence against prostitutes are obvious. And it&#x27;s obvious why home owners wouldn&#x27;t want street walkers outside their front doors. Let&#x27;s set those aside and consider indoor prostitution without slavery or violence.<p>1. In many places, to collect unemployment benefits you have to be searching for work, and if you&#x27;re offered work you must accept it. Would you like to see your daughter or mother denied benefits because she turned down a job offer from a brothel?<p>2. There are a bunch of things we can&#x27;t consent to. Even if I sign a contract agreeing to be sold into slavery, or agreeing a loan shark can break my legs, or agreeing to work for less than the minimum wage, that part of the contract is invalid. There&#x27;s precedent for us making it impossible for people to consent to things.<p>3. If there&#x27;s someone I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have sex with, but I have sex with them to avoid being stabbed, that&#x27;s obviously rape. If I do the same thing to avoid being starved, is that so different? Oh, admittedly it&#x27;s more of a grey area, but surely punters could hold themselves to higher standards and avoid things that are even a grey area?<p>4. Trafficking and violence are giant problems. About 90% of prostitution is one or the other, and legalising prostitution will increase demand leading to more of both. Isn&#x27;t it better to sacrifice that small fraction of nonviolent prostitution to help clamp down on the much larger amount of violent prostitution? Oh, sure, the 90%/10% ratio might be a bit off, but slavery and violence are really serious, their impact should be given greater weight.<p>Not saying I agree with all of them, but I can understand why a politician might decide they have other changes to the law they&#x27;d like to see first.",1408878195

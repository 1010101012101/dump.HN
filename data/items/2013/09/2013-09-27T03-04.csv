no pointer dereferencing, yet:<p><pre><code>  [1, 2, 3].map(|x| if *x > max { max = *x });

In fact, it will get you as far as the next company that comes along and dangles a nice raise in your LinkedIn inbox with the promise of solving interesting problems.<p>The cause is what creates long-term loyalty.  For employers, maintaining this cause is the challenge.  Causes are expensive.  All too often, causes are set aside in the interest of profitability.

The kind of Linus Torvald-style rants and flame wars are extremely rare internally, and many people are happy to help and mentor. I&#x27;ve worked at IBM and Oracle and there were plenty of shouting matches between alpha-male hackers battling egos.<p>Secondly, secrecy pisses people off. To give you an example, there was a high-profile flop that started life as a secret project until it was almost ready for release, and it drove a lot of internal disharmony. In fact, one of the reasons listed in the post-mortem for the product flopping was the fact that it was developed in secret. Googlers don&#x27;t like secrecy.<p>2) The engineers are world class, period. Jeff Dean. Rob Pike. Etc. &#x27;Nuff Said. It&#x27;s possible in a smaller company to be a big fish in a small pond. It&#x27;s part of what drives the big, hot-headed egos of engineering prima donnas. They&#x27;re the shit, because they might have 10 other junior engineers around them who are far less knowledgeable. You can&#x27;t really get away with those kinds of attitudes at Google, and that may be part of the reason for the more relaxed, cooperative humility (&#x27;googliness&#x27;), because many of your peers are just as good, if not better, than you.<p>The grey areas are this. As Google becomes larger, the probability of a shitty employee being immature and leaking to the press goes up. As a result, Google is not as wide-open internally as it used to be. Some of the bad employees have spoiled it for the majority. Moreover, to my dismay, many of Google&#x27;s attempts at federated, open protocols have failed in the marketplace. Open doesn&#x27;t always win, or, takes a long time, and the success of closed silos of competitors I think has taught some Google product teams the wrong lesson, and forced it to compete on the same grounds of its competitors. Hopefully, eventually when things reach saturation and commodification, they&#x27;ll be a return to setting standards, but I&#x27;m cynical. Apple has the whole industry thinking open specifications are bad because you can&#x27;t make arbitrary changes to them to vertically integrate and suit your needs.  And Google&#x27;s years of supporting XMPP federation did nothing to get AOL, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, et al on board. You can&#x27;t say Google didn&#x27;t try, they ran GTalk for years, but none of the big players with 10s or 100s of millions of users played along.",1380252971

They already have a very usable app in place for users to access their content. However, it would be incredibly foolish for them to head into that now. It would not put them in a powerful position. They would just lose millions.<p>The cable system is still entrenched. They gain tons of customers through cable providers. If they were to abandon that model... do you really believe all of those who were subscribing to HBO / premium channels would switch over to HBO as a digital subscriber? Of course not. Sure, many would switch but they would lose a lot of customers. Would they gain back customers whom didn&#x27;t opt in to the cable provider method but would opt in for digital subscription? I&#x27;m sure this would happen. But it likely wouldn&#x27;t overcome the loss of cable provider subscriptions.<p>HBO has consistently stayed ahead of the curve and been very innovative. They will switch when the time is right and not any sooner. They sure as hell will not need to be &quot;dragged kicking and screaming.&quot;",1380252789

6455040,comment,6453928,6454976,19,0,ggchappell,,,"> These scientists don&#x27;t work for NASA, most of them work for private institutes and some are based in Europe, ...<p>Yes. Also Canada.<p>> ... the work is entitled to be copyrighted, ...<p>You&#x27;re heading in the right direction here, but copyright does not work quite that way in the modern world. No one <i>copyrights</i> (verb) things anymore. Rather, copyright exists in most works upon their creation. So, yes, these are copyrighted works. (And so is your HN comment, by the way.)<p>> ... and basically you&#x27;re stealing it and giving it away for free.<p>The scientists already gave it away to the journal for free. Journals, which provide nothing in the modern world except prestige, now hold the copyright and charge for access. No one is stealing anything, since everyone who had a copy before still has a copy. Yes, the papers are now being given away free to the public, probably against the wishes of the copyright holder (the journal).<p>> But these scientists didn&#x27;t do anything wrong by publishing THEIR works (not Public Domain works) behind a pay wall.<p>Close. The scientists assigned the copyright to the journal, for no payment (but for the prestige of it). The journal is the one publishing behind a paywall, and the journal is the one getting any money collected.<p>Now, to the real point: &quot;wrong&quot; is not the same as &quot;illegal&quot;. Yes, the journal holds the copyright to the paper, and it is legally entitled to charge for access. But what about the moral issue? <i>I</i> funded this work. Me. My taxes paid for it. If you are a U.S. taxpayer, then you paid for it, too. And yet now I&#x27;m supposed to pay to see it? There&#x27;s a problem there.<p>This <i>would</i> be illegal[1] if these guys were medical researchers funded by the NIH, which has a policy that publications coming out of projects they fund must be freely accessible.[2] It is not illegal here; I think it should be.<p>And one more thing that many people don&#x27;t catch: the researchers would probably love to have their papers more accessible. They are not sending papers to pay-walled journals because they like limited access. They are doing it because these are the journals that give them prestigious publications. The journals can trade on their prestige to enforce conditions on the researchers, like limited access. <i>No</i> <i>one</i> likes this except the journals. If NASA made a policy that papers from their projects must be made freely available, then the journals would either have to allow it, or else stop publishing all NASA-based works. Experience strongly suggests that they would do the former.<p>[EDIT--One more quick note before the editing period closes: It appears the author of the post might not be clear on the distinction between researchers working on NASA projects and researchers doing projects using data that NASA has made available for anyone to use. I am primarily addressing the former situation here. However, what I said about the journals being the only ones with any interest in limited access, applies to academic researchers in general.]<p>[1] Or maybe not quite <i>illegal</i>, but rather <i>against</i> <i>regulations</i>. Almost but not quite the same thing.<p>[2] <a href=""http://publicaccess.nih.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publicaccess.nih.gov/</a>",1380251396

It also have 2 filtered 5-star reviews from people who loved it.<p>From what I can tell, all 3 reviews were kosher. Unfortunately because yelp incorrectly filtered the two 5-star reviews, the restaurant has an unfounded poor reputation on yelp. I left a 5-star review, and as far as I can see my review isn&#x27;t filtered (at least, not when I view it). Perhaps that is because I&#x27;m a long-time yelp user.",1380251358

And yes, our view has basically been that we want to build the most open and accessible crowdfunding tools for the entire web/world. Crowdtilt.com might be for medium size campaigns, Crowdhoster (built by us and powered by our API) is for large-scale ones like Soylent, and now with our mobile app, we want to see if people will want to take the mechanics of crowdfunding models and want to go small with them.<p>If Crowdhoster is like the wordpress (hostable, customizable, open-source), then the Crowdtilt app type of campaigns (launched from the app, at least) is like the twitter of crowdfunding, or perhaps more appropriately, for anytime a group would interact around a small, casual financial objective. There&#x27;s no guarantee the behavior will become our primary creation driver, of course, but as devs, it&#x27;s exciting to try and take something as conventionally complex as crowdfunding/fundraising/pooling money with a group and simplify it down to something easy to digest in a mobile experience. If you download the app and have any suggestions or feedback on our approach to tackle this problem, would love to hear it at jb@crowdtilt.com. And another lens to view our approach toward mobile is this - 7/8ths of the world will never own a computer. Like, ever.",1380250994

You just have to take the existential outlook that you may die or be immortal, in either case you have to define and strive for happiness.  I remember as a child thinking ""death will never happen to me.""  I also used to find refuge in belief, until I realized it was just a delusion.<p>I found that liberating, though.  If life is here for a moment or forever, it is best not to let death define it.  Just live.<p>Richard Carrier has a few essays on secular valuation of life; you might want to check those out.

In the morning, add canned tomatoes, corn, green beans, carrots, and peas. Eat at lunch. If you like, keep refilling with vegetables each night (and hamburger every other night) and you can keep it going for a week or so.

It reminds me of the <i>""no serious business person will buy those toy computers that Apple company is maklng""</i> arguments. It is not so surprising considering the author moves in circles where <i>broadcast quality</i> and <i>advertising dollars</i> mean these type of activities (students downloading shows) are not on the <i>""big guys""</i> radar. <p>I can see clearly that opportunities are missed here simply because online shows are seen as poor quality... <i>""Why would anyone watch these shows when they could simply hire them or purchase some cable time?""</i> ",1190332240

Brilliant people.  The original AMAPS, now Fourth Shift was written by one guy.  MMC, Compufact, Dataworks by 2 guys.  The now defunct ASK MANMAN package was written by a married couple.  So was QAD.  (These kinda remind me of the couple who started Cisco.)  They all sold thousands of installations, for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars each.  They were so successful that, inevitably, the hats came along.  The brilliant people have moved on, and what was left is what you see now.  ",1190330006

57669,comment,57538,57538,0,0,pg,,,"Rtm and I lived on this during Viaweb:<p>Rice and Beans<p><pre><code> olive oil or butter
 n yellow onions
 3n cloves garlic
 n 12-oz cans Goya white beans
 n cubes Knorr beef bouillon
 n teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
 3n teaspoons cumin
 n cups rice, preferably sushi rice
</code></pre>
Put rice in rice cooker. Add water as specified on rice package. (Default: 2 cups water per cup of rice.) Turn on rice cooker and forget about it.<p>Chop onions and fry in oil, over fairly low heat, till glassy. Put in chopped garlic, pepper, cumin, and a little more fat, and stir. Keep heat low. Cook another 2 or 3 minutes, then add beans (don't drain the beans), and stir. Throw in the bouillon cube(s), cover, and cook on lowish heat for at least 10 minutes more. Stir vigilantly to avoid sticking.<p>If I were making it now I'd probably add a little curry powder, include some more vegetables (e.g. chopped peppers), and use brown rice.  But that was the original recipe.  <p>The rice cooker is not optional.  If you're going to eat a lot of rice and beans, you need a rice cooker.",1190329680

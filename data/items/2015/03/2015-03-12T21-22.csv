Despite this, and the show&#x27;s tone doesn&#x27;t really convey this, the secondary market was still there (for the times) and card scarcity was a big, big problem.<p>Enter Chronicles.<p>Wizards of the Coast reprinted basically everything they could from the first couple years of magic in one set.<p>“Released in July 1995, this 125-card set was created in an effort to satisfy players’ demand for out-of-print cards.”<p>This <i>tanked</i> the secondary market for cards. Investors who had been holding onto certain rare cards and treating them as an investment suddenly had the rug pulled out from under them.<p>Long story short, a few years after this, Wizards created the Reserved List (tm), essentially a promise to <i></i>NEVER<i></i> reprint all cards contained within. Intended to create a safe haven for investors and collectors, this list covers the first ~5 years of Magic cards and almost all of its most expensive prints. It&#x27;s a source of huge contention within the community as many people would like the reserved list to be abolished so they have access to play with cards they wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford otherwise.<p>Feel free to let me know if I missed something critical, was just an thought I had while listening to the show.

(1) The flight is only incidental to that business or employment; and
(2) The aircraft does not carry passengers or property for compensation or hire.&quot;<p>This basically means that if you are a pilot that works for a non-aviation related company, you may fly around as part of your job, for example for you and some coworkers to get to a meeting.<p>If the company or individual makes money directly off the flight, then I&#x27;m pretty sure it will never be considered incidental.

I understand the issue of conflict of interest when it comes to things like government contracts and public corporations.  Here conflict of interest occurs because the person makes decisions on how to spend money that isn&#x27;t their money.  It is either the taxpayer&#x27;s money or the stockholder&#x27;s money.<p>In a private company, like Andreessen Horowitz, they are effectively spending their own money.  If they choose to invest in a company founded by one of their partners, I do not see the conflict of interest.  From the outside we may question whether or not the startup is really worthy of being funded, but it really isn&#x27;t our call to make.<p>But what if it was our call to make?  Did they make a bad decision by funding one of their own?  Looking at his track record he already has experience as a co-founder and a CTO.  On top of having prior experience, he has worked as a partner at Andreessen Horowitz for over a year.  The people making the decision whether or not to fund his startup have experience working with him.  They probably have a good idea of whether this person can or cannot deliver.<p>I think most people object to this, because they imagine a situation where a better startup is not funded because the partners decided to fund their buddy instead.  Let us say that is true.  For the sake of argument, assume this guy is incompetent and should not be given funding.  Imagine this guy worked at Andreessen Horowitz for over a year and everyone knew he was incompetent, but decided to fund him anyways just because they were BFFs.<p>I guess it is possible something like this happened, but I doubt it.  I recently finished reading Horowitz’s book The Hard Thing about Hard Things and he doesn’t seem like the type of person who keeps incompetent people around just because likes them.<p>The only valid objection I see is if they are using information provided to them under a non-disclosure agreement to gain unfair advantage.  But is this a valid concern? As others have pointed out, most ideas are cheap.  Even if that information provides some short-term advantage, it won’t help in the long-term as the market changes.",1426196516

I think you&#x27;ve misunderstood me. Let me try and be more specific and concrete.<p>The degree to which code written by different authors at different times can gel together depends on the idioms they have in common. In languages without common collection libraries, code needs to communicate at the level of arrays and custom iterators. Languages without a single common memory allocator need have libraries negotiate who owns what memory, and have custom free functions specific to routines and libraries. Languages without lambdas typically reinvent the concept a half-dozen different, incompatible ways.<p>The amount of friction when trying to compose code or integrate with existing code is proportional to its divergence from the lowest common denominator of all code written in that language. The higher-level a language is, the larger a standard library it has, the more concepts that are shared between libraries and codebases and don&#x27;t need to be reinvented in each individual code silo.<p>Go back to C in the dark days of Windows 95. Merely getting a string out of the OS was an ordeal; you could choose to allocate a buffer, send it to the OS, but always prepared to react to a failure and reallocate the buffer when the string turns out bigger than expected. C has no universal string type nor a common memory allocator (you might rely on glibc&#x27;s malloc on Linux, but you&#x27;re relying on non-portable convention). This directly resulted in a substantial amount of friction simply interoperating between two binary libraries.<p>The same thing follows through with higher-level concepts. When higher-level concepts are concrete in the language or available in standard libraries rather than composed out of simpler primitives a half-dozen times in slightly different ways, you lose a bunch of composability. You spend more time writing shims and adapters to smooth away the differences between interfaces.<p>And code isn&#x27;t the only interface; your mind is too, especially in a larger legacy codebase. You may understand iterators, lambdas, functors, monads and so on, but in a language without first-class support and standard definitions for these things, you&#x27;ll find them reinvented over and over again, to varying degrees of fidelity, sometimes under obscure names, which you&#x27;ll need to discover and research as you dig into code nobody still in the organization has ever had to dig through themselves.<p>None of this has anything to do with code quality possible in a language. I&#x27;ve had to maintain some extremely high quality assembly. But it wasn&#x27;t mentally cheap to get into, and a lot of concepts had to be reverse engineered from the code before they could be modified and transformed back down.<p>The risk with something like Lisp is that you use it as a language construction toolkit. With a closely knit team that grows a codebase amongst themselves, this can be a huge productivity win. But I don&#x27;t think it scales. And I think history agrees. Excessively malleable languages (including Smalltalk) have not outcompeted less expressive languages, for one reason or another.",1426196484

She plans to visit London, Wales (I don&#x27;t know which city), Nottingham, Edinburgh, and Stonehenge or another henge. She&#x27;ll be in Ireland for about a week, but isn&#x27;t sure where to go outside of Dublin yet. She&#x27;ll be traveling with three of her sisters and a friend. They plan to rent a car. She doesn&#x27;t drink alcohol. She prefers BnBs to hotels, and I&#x27;ve shown her how to use Airbnb if they don&#x27;t find a vacant BnB where they plan to sleep.<p>I would greatly appreciate if anyone from or familiar with these countries could offer any tips, suggestions, or warnings.",1426196248

It&#x27;s striking to me how little discussions of the last-mile were framing the debate, or how little consumer choice was taken into consideration. According to Wheeler, my interests as a consumer end at me not having my traffic biased. When in fact, most consumers are more interested in having choice in last-mile providers, or just paying less for their Internet connectivity. In short, I&#x27;m bummed we didn&#x27;t get unbundling in the last-mile.</i><p>I agree 100%. I was agape that Wheeler at least twice used his old company NABU as an opening shtick- a story about trying to create a competitive cable provider, but not having unbundling to pull it off; for him to transition into regulation instead of competition was comedically dissonant.<p>As for actually undoing bundling, it&#x27;s the courts. They decided that given that fiber investments were going to be costly, and given the threat that build-outs might not happen, the scales somehow tipped to allow them to overturn (on purely economic merits) the FCC&#x27;s rules on local loop unbundling.<p><i>Thus, we determine that, particularly in light of a competitive landscape in which competitive LECs are leading the deployment of FTTH, removing incumbent LEC unbundling obligations on FTTH loops will promote their deployment of the network infrastructure necessary to provide broadband services to the mass market.</i><p><a href=""https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-03-36A1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-03-36A1.pd...</a> , paragraph 278.<p>Truly one of the worst, least well-structured Court rulings to have occurred.

Second, they&#x27;re generally run by giant financial firms, who nobody likes right now. Third, they&#x27;re a fuzzy concept. In reverse order:<p>A dark pool is really just a private exchange, or really just what you&#x27;d call anything that functioned in any way like a private exchange. They&#x27;re a tool, deployed to solve problems for (primarily) large investors. When you start talking about market structure and facilities, it can get pretty weird to talk about &quot;intentions&quot;. Major exchanges are also routinely used for shady transactions!<p>The best-known purpose (or &quot;intention&quot;) of a dark pool is to allow huge buy-side institutional investor to move large blocks of securities. If you don&#x27;t spend much time reading about market microstructure, you&#x27;re probably unaware that this is one of the fundamental problems in trading.† Market &quot;physics&quot; dictate that there is no instantaneous price available for the sale of a large block of securities. A huge order will gobble up many orders off the order book, and, as it executes over time, it <i>moves prices</i> --- the intent of a large investor to dump a lot of securities on the market is extremely relevant to everyone else in the market, and to the correct price of that security.<p>The best known dark pools tend to be owned by giant investment banks and similar firms. This should be unsurprising, because one of the key services those firms offer their clients is &quot;efficiently shopping or buying large blocks of securities&quot;. To deliver that service on open exchanges, they have to compete with other firms that are aggressively trying to detect big moves and profit from quickly making prices reflect those moves, often while the move is happening.

And some shady stuff happens (apparently most of which has to do with the promises made to dark pool clients when they agree to execute orders there).

For instance: some dark pool controversy involves big pools persuading big investors to execute trades on their pools, whereupon they&#x27;re &quot;victimized&quot; by HFTs and other aggressive traders. Through the lens of &quot;promises should be kept&quot; and &quot;truth in advertising&quot;, this is bad.

Right now everyone is paying lip-service to freedom of speech/content or focusing on this as a win for net neutrality over big corporations or whatever but they are missing the forest for the trees.<p>This is a huge power grab and most people are missing the implications. As the OP (that I replied to) pointed out such locus of power then become the focus of effort to control or influence that power. Look up &quot;regulatory capture&quot; on Wikipedia and see what happens in the long run under these types of regulatory environments (an executive agency implementing a broad legislative mandate/authority for some goal with virtually unlimited power to regulate).

And the spec itself has matured tremendously, with some great features that don&#x27;t even have direct equivalents in Direct3D.<p>Sadly as a whole the API still sucks, especially if you care about supporting the vast majority of the audience who want to play video games. Issues I&#x27;ve hit in particular:<p>Every vendor&#x27;s shader compiler is broken in different ways. You HAVE to test all your shaders on each vendor, if not on each OS/vendor combination or even each OS/vendor/common driver combination. Many people are running outdated drivers or have some sort of crazy GPU-switching solution.<p>The API is still full of performance landmines, with a half-dozen ways to accomplish various goals and no consistent fast-path across all the vendors.<p>At least on Windows, OpenGL debugging is a horror show, especially if you compare it with the robust DirectX debugging tools (PIX, etc) or the debugging tools on consoles.<p>Threading is basically a non-starter. You can get it to work on certain configurations but doing threading with OpenGL across a wide variety of machines is REALLY HARD, to the point that sometimes driver vendors will tell you themselves that you shouldn&#x27;t bother. In most cases the extent of threading I see in shipped games is using a thread to load textures in the background (this is relatively well-supported, though I&#x27;ve still seen it cause issues on user machines.)<p>OpenGL&#x27;s documentation is still spotty in places and some of the default behaviors are bizarre. The most egregious example I can think of is texture completeness; texture completeness is a baffling design decision in the spec that results in your textures mysteriously sampling as pure black. Texture completeness is not something you will find mentioned or described <i>anywhere</i> in documentation; the only way to find out about it is to read over the entire OpenGL spec, because they shoved it in an area you wouldn&#x27;t be looking to debug texturing/shading issues. I personally tend to lose a day to this every project or two, and I know other experienced developers who still get caught by it.<p>I should follow with the caveat that Valve claims GL is faster than Direct3D, and I don&#x27;t doubt that for their use cases it is. In practice I&#x27;ve never had my OpenGL backend outperform my Direct3D backend on user machines, in part because I can exploit threads on D3D and I can&#x27;t on GL.",1426195347

The Mantle spec is effectively written by Johan Andersson at DICE, and the Khronos Vulkan spec basically pulls Aras P at Unity, Niklas S at Epic, and a couple guys at Valve into the fold.</i><p>This begs the question: what about DirectX 12 and Apple&#x27;s Metal? If they didn&#x27;t have similar engine developer involvement, that&#x27;s clearly a point against DX12/Metal support in the long run.<p>Also, the end is worth quoting in its entirety to explain why the APIs are taking such a radical change from the traditional rendering model:<p><i>Personally, my take is that MS and ARB always had the wrong idea. Their idea was to produce a nice, pretty looking front end and deal with all the awful stuff quietly in the background. Yeah it&#x27;s easy to code against, but it was always a bitch and a half to debug or tune. Nobody ever took that side of the equation into account. What has finally been made clear is that it&#x27;s okay to have difficult to code APIs, if the end result just works. And that&#x27;s been my experience so far in retooling: it&#x27;s a pain in the ass, requires widespread revisions to engine code, forces you to revisit a lot of assumptions, and generally requires a lot of infrastructure before anything works. But once it&#x27;s up and running, there&#x27;s no surprises. It works smoothly, you&#x27;re always on the fast path, anything that IS slow is in your OWN code which can be analyzed by common tools. It&#x27;s worth it.</i><p>I wonder if/when web developers will reach a similar point of software layer implosion. &quot;Easy to code against, but a bitch and a half to debug or tune&quot; is an adequate description of pretty much everything in web development today, yet everyone keeps trying to patch it over with even more &quot;easy&quot; layers on top.

Thus, for example, a guy randomly shooting footage happens to capture a newsworthy event and later sells that footage to a news network will most likely be treated as not operating the drone commercially.

We already have the most efficient machine that converts plant matter into meat. It&#x27;s called a cow. Cows and other ruminants have evolved over millions, if not billions of years, to make this process super efficient using just solar energy (photosynthesis) and water. Who are we to think we can do better in a few years in the lab?<p>Have these companies thought about the environmental impact of growing more row crops to create this fake meat and eggs? Row crops destroy ecosystems and reduce topsoil. It&#x27;s also a system that sounds like it would need lots of logistics and energy to operate. Also it&#x27;s not sustainable.<p>Silicon Valley should instead fund organizations looking to work with nature to create the future of food. Companies like Summer Technologies [1] are doing the right thing by acknowledging nature and creating technology that empowers sustainable agriculture that scales. With the right tools, these kind of farms can be more productive than massive industrial farms [2], feed the growing population of the world [3], while improving the quality of land and reducing CO2. It&#x27;s a win-win-win if I&#x27;ve ever seen one.<p>This article also fails to mention anything about how the dangers of meat are greatly over exaggerated and not corroborated by modern science.

That&#x27;s a humongous straw man, it&#x27;s the same straw man pg used in his original article, and it&#x27;s complete nonsense. &quot;Reduce income inequality&quot; does not mean eliminate all income inequality.<p>So you seem to agree that income inequality can be a good thing. If you didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;d want everyone to have the same income. Maybe I misunderstood PG&#x27;s essay, but the main takeaway I got was that income inequality CAN be a good thing for a society, and that the income inequality caused by successful startups are not an important enough problem (if it is even a problem) to society for us to try to focus on it.",1451955457

You feeling offended could have more to do with your own prejudice being exposed (the joke worked) than feeling sorry for the arabs that may have been offended by this (there is, as of yet, no sign pointing to that).<p>Humor uses stereotypes. That&#x27;s why the owner of the Kwik-E-Mart is an Indian illegal immigrant named Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. If such humor makes one uncomfortable, do you really think that is out of empathy for the Indians? I think it is more likely that one has a thin skin or does not want to see their own stereotypes confirmed.<p>Also the context is important here (see the Comodo Hacker).

10840145,comment,10835978,10839465,0,0,mikeash,,,"What ambiguity are you referring to? It has nothing to do with value versus reference types. Reference types have the exact same difference between the two languages. In Swift, mutable variables are captured by reference by default, and in Objective-C they&#x27;re copied by default. Value versus reference doesn&#x27;t make a difference. For example:<p><pre><code>    NSView *view = [NSButton new];\n    void (^block)(void) = ^{ NSLog(@&quot;%@&quot;, view); };\n    view = [NSTextField new];\n    block();\n</code></pre>\nIn Objective-C, this will log an NSButton. Translate it to Swift and it will log an NSTextField.<p>I don&#x27;t think either behavior is more correct, it&#x27;s just a fairly arbitrary choice. IMO it&#x27;s surprising only if you&#x27;ve learned to expect one way because you worked in a language that does it that way, then encounter a language that does it the other way.",1451955362

He&#x27;s right.

Investors also steer clear of the entire region.  This is a great indicator that it is not conducive for any sort of small business.<p>This bottleneck prevents prosperity and creates an environment where citizens are more dependent on big corporations and there is almost no chance of moving up the socioeconomic ladder.<p>It also means less of a chance of getting a loan from a bank, which is another requirement for someone with no money to start a business.<p>I&#x27;ve never met a group that tries so hard to sabotage their own future success/vote against their own self-interests.",1451955286

Roughly 70% of US GDP is private consumption (household final consumption expenditure).  Startups that build cool products need markets that can afford to buy them.<p>The top 1%-2% may be wealthy, but as a consumer segment they are not big enough to justify new microprocessor plant or Apple product line. More importantly, rich don&#x27;t pay for innovation.  Luxury phones like Vertu are  diamonds and personal service, there is no pressure for innovation. You don&#x27;t need speech recognition if you can afford personal service. You don&#x27;t need self driving car if you have a driver or enjoy driving with your Porsche.<p>It&#x27;s the middle class who creates demand for high-tech bleeding edge innovations. Who will buy the Oculus rifts and create enough  cash flow to carry the VR-industry next 5 years? If the number of upper middle class families drops 5%, will Tesla lose 5% of their sales? The share of the GDP going to the middle class has been falling. It&#x27;s down roughly 10% from  2000 and something like 30-20% from 70&#x27;s.<p>Low income people spend more money into necessities and very small high income population just can&#x27;t consume enough to be large demand creating force. If the income distribution of the country starts to resemble classical South American country, it will have the economic structure  of classical South American country sooner or later.<p>PG has supply side view of the economy.

Whether you believe you can &quot;create wealth&quot; or not, poverty is quite simply a central facet of inequality; it is part of the DEFINITION of inequality.  Poverty IS inequality, along with riches.  All it means, is there&#x27;s an income or wealth distribution curve whose slope is nonzero.<p>There is no conceptual definition of inequality that doesn&#x27;t include poverty.  If everyone had the same wealth, that, by definition, is a situation of\n1) no inequality\n2) no poverty<p>Whereas as soon as some people have more, and others have less (which is quaintly known as a little thing we call &quot;inequality&quot;) there is a phenomenon crying out to be described, and that phenomenon is: A poorer group exists.  There is poverty.  Even if the poorer group is only just slightly poorer.  Which interestingly indicates that poverty is inherently comparative.  Equality is absolute; inequality is always relative.  Just like in math.<p>You probably think you happen to have a lot, and people in the Third World happen to not have a lot.  No.  You have a lot, BECAUSE the people in the Third World don&#x27;t have a lot.  And they have less BECAUSE you have more.  The corporations working on your behalf extracted that wealth from them, and conveyed it to you.  (And to themselves of course.)  And when those people try to immigrate to your country they are just trying to follow their own money to your doorstep.<p>Anyway the thing everybody hates and wants to fight is not that &quot;some people make money&quot; but that &quot;the Paul Graham class&quot; can buy themselves a Congressman.  They can emit ridiculous brain-farts over and over (Musk) and the media fawningly fellates.  They can invest in a thing and slavish people infer directly from that, &quot;Wow, must be real valuable!&quot;  Inequality confers unfair political advantage which leads to disproportionate opportunity which leads to further inequality in the same direction.  It is not a self-stabilizing system inherently.  It is prone to excesses and failure, and a shity quality of life for the majority on its way to getting there.  Go ahead and push that as far as you can, see what happens.",1451954829

In particular all of the infinities in question are countable, so in some sense they are the &quot;same size&quot;.<p>But there are two approaches that we can use.<p>The first is to point out that in real life it is more common to encounter small numbers than big ones.  So if you choose a probability distribution for what denominators you expect in practice, and sum up the values of all of the exactly represented numbers, you can get to a fixed probability of even division.  And it won&#x27;t be zero.<p>Unfortunately your choice of the relative probability of having a 2 in the denominator versus a 3 is extremely arbitrary.  So while the approach makes sense, the numbers you get really will be made up.  (Though no matter how you make them up, your general statement is guaranteed correct.)<p>The second approach is to just look at how the count of exactly representable numbers below N scales with both N and your set of primes.  This has been studied.  The exact counts are a mess, but if you have a set S of prime divisors of size k, then the count is (1+o(1)) * 1/k! * [product over p in S of (log(N)/log(p)].<p>The upshot is that for large N, more prime factors always wins.  And for specific prime factors, you just look at the ratio of logs.<p>For instance with this approach we can say that log(3)/log(5) = 1.46497352071793... times as many denominators are exactly representable in base 12 as in base 10.  (The log(2) factors cancel out.)  Therefore base 12 is better.<p>Of course the second approach says that base 6 is as good as base 12, and it is smaller, so why not use it?  Well, the reason why we keep on winding up with base 12 in practical situations is that divisibility by 4 comes up a lot.  It isn&#x27;t just exactly representable that matters, efficiency matters.",1451954378

Very generally, for a crowded market think of things in terms of a &#x27;distribution strategy&#x27; vs a pure marketing/pricing one. People invariably buy from a small subset in a range of choices. Your job is to market sure you become within that subset, and then have a hook to get you over the decision line in enough cases. People are generally looking for simplicity so dont overthink it. Just get the product in front of people and then give them that hook. Test/learn and be flexible. Look what the competitors are doing and emulate them if you unsure until you understand things better.<p>Most importantly, understand the financial metrics of customer acquisition. Not doing so is a common error. I see it in almost every business I consult.

Unemployment is too low.  Too many people who want to work are working.  Businessweek sees this as a problem.  CEOs and LP&#x27;s and rentiers see this as a problem.<p>Workers work.  They create wealth.  A carpentry shop has carpenters bang wood and nails together to make tables.  The workers labor creates wealth - wood and nails becomes a table which costs more.<p>For the first six hours a day the worker keeps the wealth they create - their wage.  The rest of that revenue goes for replenishment of supplies - wood, nails, 1/90th of a hammer cost etc.<p>For the last two hours a day, the worker is not paid the wealth they create.  It goes in profit to the heir who owns the manufacturing plant.  The worker&#x27;s surplus labor time is being expropriated by the heir.<p>If unemployment was low, if poverty was lessened - then those who work could demand to be paid for more of their time.  Increasing unemployment, increasing poverty lessens the chance of this happening.<p>The LP&#x27;s, the heirs want poverty.  It&#x27;s an essential cornerstone of their profit and expropriation.<p>Centuries ago, most of the world were farmers under feudalism (or hunter/gatherers etc.)  There was not structural unemployment then.  Lords wanted farmers working hard to sow during planting and reap during harvest.  Only in our modern age of capitalism do those who control production desire poverty, unemployment etc.  That Businessweek article lays out a portion of that ideology, it&#x27;s been spoken of elsewhere for a long time.<p>The idea that the heir LP&#x27;s on the other end of the inequality divide want poverty to end is absurd.

But another way is simply being type safe! Type safety means that int pointers and float pointers (in Java, int[] and float[]) can&#x27;t alias by construction--otherwise the types would be wrong. So a Java compiler can just do this optimization without worrying about it.

People have written books on it, and I am assuming you aren&#x27;t directly correlating it with the tax rate.<p>&quot;The &#x27;uber wealthy&#x27; pay more in taxes than they will ever use in their lifetime..and probably 10,000 or more people&#x27;s lifetime.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t true, yea maybe they won&#x27;t pull or have the need for a social security check, but their businesses and investments rely on public infrastructure, education, and the federal military protecting their international assets and trade rights MUCH more then the average joe. This is compounded by the fact that our corrupt system of government you so aptly pointed out, has allowed the policy making to overwhelming favor the established crony capitalists.<p>&quot;Instead of focusing on how much more money we can appropriate from the wealthy, we should first be making politicians and governments accountable for the money we are paying into the system now. Without this accountability, we will continue to run out of money.&quot;<p>You are totally right, we should be figuring out how to be less wasteful -- and there is also plenty of legislation that creates unnecessary waste and bureaucracy. I think this is beyond a discussion about taxes though, and more about restructuring our government in a bipartisan effort -- which starts with who we elect. I think you can separate the two arguments. But yea, totally agree. One thing to keep in mind though, all large human organizations become less efficient and wasteful -- so this is not just a government problem. See HP.<p>Lastly, I don&#x27;t think that the NBA analogy really works here. Just because someone is born with athletic ability doesn&#x27;t automatically make them draft ready. They spend 10-15 years honing their skills, spending time with world class coaches, and working hard to get to the NBA. Someone born into obscene wealth usually comes with years of investment management and financial teams built around the family to maintain that wealth -- with a high potential for the child to be very disconnected from reality and never have that same urge to work that the NBA player had. See the affluenza case for example. I am not suggesting we should punish someones children by any means for your own success, but there is a difference between providing your kids a nice life and supporting modern day princes and kings.<p>Obviously this last bit is more of a generalization, but I hope it shows the fault in your NBA analogy. Otherwise I do agree with the sentiment that yes, there are natural vagina lotteries, but being smarter or more athletic is a net positive for a society -- whereas being born into inordinate amounts of wealth could actually end up being a negative over the long term when your ruling class is further removed and further concentrated from the average.",1451952390

At a personal level when people at Automattic talk about individual candidates, it probably also sucks. But at a corporate level, evaluating whether their process is meeting their business needs? This issue, though legit, doesn&#x27;t smell like a deal-killer.",1451952023

Introns can change the local conformation of DNA, act as enhancers, impact splicing, etc. The genome is an incredibly vibrant machine (ecosystem, really) -- it&#x27;s nothing at all like linear code. Just because it&#x27;s non-coding doesn&#x27;t make it &quot;junk DNA&quot;.",1451952005

What&#x27;s the conversion rate of that 40% who could use the on demand service for moving humans? 50%? That&#x27;s not a massive pile of customers.<p>Assuming that your estimate 50% of non-truck owners adopting it is correct, that&#x27;s 20% of 253 million cars, which is 50 million. Seems massive to me.<p>> Built in car-seats are almost a mirage, they are wildly uncommon.<p>What makes you think that they won&#x27;t become more common (especially among car service vehicles) if there is a strong demand for them from car subscription services?  It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a complicated technology to add.<p>> The premise still remains, overwhelming majority of people will not want to abandon a personally owned vehicle for some on-demand car that arrives and some varying condition and layout that you have to load/unload every time with your things.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you can be so sure of your prediction of future demand, especially when technology is changing so fast.<p>Regarding the particulars you mention, I already load/unload my private car with stuff, but 90% of the time, it&#x27;s just me and my backpack.<p>Sure, you can&#x27;t use a rented vehicle as paperwork storage, but why would one use a car for storing paperwork?<p>Chargers can be provided in the rental vehicle (just like Starbucks does).<p>> Try it for a week if you drive<p>I routinely take the train (with the kids and all their gear), and we have to naturally take everything we brought with us when we get off.  If anything, the rental car scenario is more convenient than that.",1451952000

A friend of mine managed to save $20k in 2.5 years on a grad student salary (~$20K/year).<p>The secret is really roommates + no car + long walk to mass transit + cheap food.  If you're willing to walk about 20 minutes to the nearest T stop, you can get quite a few places in the Boston area for ~$400/month.  Eat vegetarian with a lot of rice & pasta dishes and you can probably squeak in under $10k/year, particularly if the university provides health insurance.",1228107219

Speculator demand is what explains the price rise and that demand is what makes a bubble. That is only part of the reason. Artificial demand was created by lowering mortgage standards allowing many more ""fake bidders"" into the market.

381388,comment,380377,381243,0,0,zaidf,,,"""It's a fair point but I wouldn't characterize it as a negotiation.""<p>I think you are just playing with semantics;) In general, trying to change your agreement with a vendor is negotiating in my books. Remember if I proposed $100/month, the vendor could well come back and make a counteroffer of $110/month. I might sleep over it. And then agree to it. I'd call that negotiation.<p>I can see value in Ridgely Evers book. But I see NOT negotiating aggressively as a bigger problem than negotiating too aggressively. Totally agree with Ridgely in that you have to have a sense of to what extent the vendor will go to accommodate you before it is not worth his time and investment.<p>For hosting, it is not too difficult to calculate that point. ie. say we are paying $3000/month for a high-end server. We know the hardware cost $6,000 to the host. We know we have been with the host for 6 months and paid them $18,000. We know, thus, that the host has already recovered the cost of the hardware. In addition, we know that the bandwidth at the datacenter costs the host no more than $500/month and the rackspace for our server ~$200/month.<p>With the server cost paid, we are costing the host ~$700/month and making them a rough profit of ~$2300. At this point, we may be tempted to start our negotiation by telling them we can only afford to pay $1500. Realistically, we can settle on $2,000...saving 33%/month.<p>All the numbers above are almost real from our recent negotiation with a host.",1228106525

381371,comment,381254,381254,0,0,nostrademons,,,"They'll have to do the same thing that everyone else who's worked in the computer industry for a long period of time does: they retrain in the latest and greatest technology every 5-10 years.<p>Some of people I've worked with have great stories about programming in PL/1, on punch cards, and then dropping the box of cards and sending their program sprawling across the tiled floor.  Or writing a compiler in Fortran and having to manage their own overlays because only one pass could fit in memory at the same time.  It's a world I can't really imagine, because it had mostly disappeared before I was born.  But they retrained in various minicomputer assembly languages, and then C, and then C++, and sometimes Java, and one was even learning Python last I saw him.<p>It's unrealistic to expect you'll never have to learn anything new in this field.  Heck, I've only been doing this for 8 years (with a 4-year break for college) and I've had to reinvent myself twice already (from a Java Swing programmer to a server-side webdev, and then again to a client-side JavaScript developer, and may soon be leaving that behind for mobile).  Software engineering can be a harsh field like that.  But the flip side is that you get to work in an exciting, dynamic, wide-open field.  If you want consistency, be an accountant.",1228105243

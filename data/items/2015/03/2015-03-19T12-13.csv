9231536,comment,9230300,9230708,0,0,Trumpet6,,,"With a discussion centered on ability, but no attempt to define this nebulous concept, it seems impossible for this argument to be &quot;true&quot; in any strong sense.<p>To begin with, this discussion is almost totally void of even the mention of education (the word not appearing once), acting like all children are objects in in the global school array, with a method called &quot;getIntrinsicScore&quot; that gets called a few times in their life before the are casted into adult objects.<p>However, a simple recollection of your time in school will tell you that not everyone was treated equally by the teacher and the other students, and also that school was a pretty big deal in your life at the time.<p>So to talk about the correlations in test scores of children and neglecting to mention the influence of the school is not very informed. But since the influence of a school on the test scores of a child is not particularly well understood (witness the debate on &quot;how to fix the schools&quot;), it is really hard to make any firm claims if you include it.<p>It is also remarkable how the text underlies that the gap in scores appears with age, but does not attempt to explain this observation while advocating a static theory of &quot;ability&quot;. The author states outright that there a property fixed at birth that determines your &quot;ability&quot;, and then always talks like &quot;ability&quot; and test-score are perfectly correlated.<p>(For effect I will here do the semantic simplification the &quot;ability&quot; and &quot;test-score&quot; are perfectly interchangeable,because if the implied perfect correlation.)<p>So, the thesis is that the test-scores are fixed at birth, but the author also accepts as empirical fact that the difference of test-scores appears first around puberty. This is a curious behavior for something that is &quot;fixed&quot;. It is highly worrying that this is not addressed at all in the exposition of the theory.",1426769982

(And it probably didn&#x27;t hurt that the dealers by then were often well-established local businesses.)

It didn&#x27;t really bother me and if anything was useful recognition at school. I think this was probably because I was sufficiently good at maths that it couldn&#x27;t possibly occur to me that I couldn&#x27;t be good at maths (plus having a mum who is a mathematician was a good role model). I think actually getting a prize for being the top would have been a bit weird though and I&#x27;m trying to put my finger on why (and when I did come top in exams at Oxford, nobody commented on who the top male was!). At that sort of level, you don&#x27;t need encouragment to participate.<p>Prizes for maths are a bit of a weird thing anyway - ultimately you are doing this stuff because you enjoy solving the problems. While I think maths contests are great - I got so much out of attending the training session they held at Cambridge to choose the IMO team and meeting other people like me, even though it was an intimidating experience at first - they are competitive enough without over-emphasising it.<p>All of which isn&#x27;t to say that there aren&#x27;t massive gender issues that need to be addressed somehow or that stereotype threat isn&#x27;t real.

9231514,comment,9219432,9228175,0,0,dbaupp,,,"Even mainstream architectures don&#x27;t handle excessive consistently, e.g. for shifting an n-bit integer, I believe some mask the shift by 2^n - 1, some by 2^(n+1) - 1, and some don&#x27;t mask at all (i.e. 1 << 100000 will be zero). Of course, being UB (rather than just an &quot;unspecified result&quot; or some such) probably isn&#x27;t the best way to handle the inconsistency.<p>In any case, I believe Rust retains many of the optimisations made possible via UB in C++ by enforcing things at a compile time. In fact, Rust actually has quite a lot of UB... that is, there are many restrictions/requirements Rust &#x27;assumes&#x27; are true. For example, the reference types & and &mut have significantly more restrictions around aliasing and mutability than pointers or references in C++. The key difference between Rust and C++ is that it is only possible to trigger the UB with `unsafe`, as the compiler usually enforces rules that guarantee they can&#x27;t occur. People saying &quot;Rust has no UB&quot; are usually implicitly meaning &quot;Rust cannot trigger any UB outside `unsafe`&quot;.",1426769679

For one, it&#x27;s about what that article said about the costs involved, although I don&#x27;t fully agree on the suggested costs per iteration, as the testing can be mostly done by simulators and the physical implementation can be only a last step in a broader development chain. For other, unlike the software, on the hardware level you are actually into real engineering, forced to deal with the real-world quirks and imperfections. The hardware complexity can not just balloon as the software does. You can not add there &quot;features&quot; for the sake of it (so just to scratch your intellectual itch) without much of a consequence like you do in software, and this makes it boring and a less appealing target for development. When it happens however, you got that described problem about having to read hundreds of data-sheet pages and then deal with both all that hidden complexity and the real world.

I gave Windows 8.1 a try recently. Fresh install and Windows Update says there&#x27;s nothing to update. Knowing that&#x27;s BS, I force it to refresh -- after a significant wait suddenly there&#x27;s 1GB of updates. Really? Why did I just download a 3.5GB ISO that is 1GB out of date? I press on and force the downloads to start because a safe system is a priority to me.<p>The downloads take forever to start. When they eventually do start, they randomly stop (no ethernet activity) for random periods of time. All this time I&#x27;m twiddling my thumbs wondering if there&#x27;s some kind of &quot;intelligent&quot; downloader that is slowing down because I&#x27;m trying to do something else on the system. Eventually they finish downloading and installing and the system reboots. After the reboot... I have more hundreds of MBs more of updates waiting for me. WTF?<p>I go through this process 2 or 3 more times, and now I&#x27;m just left with &quot;optional&quot; updates. Curious, I click on the &#x27;more information&#x27; link to hit the Microsoft website (because for some reason the Windows Update UI just shows the most completely useless generic text for each update). Apparently the &#x27;optional&#x27; updates are &quot;rollups&quot;... surely that&#x27;s important?! Who knows, because Windows Update packages are opaque blobs.<p>So I go ahead and install the optional updates. Reboot. Now everything is good, right? Nope, go take a look at the Windows Update History - it turns out a bunch of updates actually failed to install at some point? It looks like they might have successfully installed later... or did they? At this point I don&#x27;t even care.<p>Compare with the Linux (Ubuntu, but I&#x27;m sure others qualify too) experience:  apt-get update; apt-get upgrade. If there&#x27;s an issue I get informed immediately and because the updates are per-package it&#x27;s clear whether or not I should care -- no opaque blobs here. When it&#x27;s done, I know it&#x27;s done and there won&#x27;t be any more magical updates mysteriously appearing. I know I can run the update/upgrade in the background while I use the machine for other things. I just don&#x27;t understand why Microsoft can&#x27;t get the update experience right!",1426769634

He&#x27;s reasonably tech-savvy but malware can happen to the best of us. I tried searching and removing suspicious looking files, but it kept coming back, so I decided to reformat the computer and reinstall windows.<p>The first part was to get an image to install from. Windows offers .iso downloads on their website[0], but you need to enter the product key for the computer to access it. I used a third-party tool to dig this out of the registry, but attempting to use this key on the website gave a non-descript error-code. After googling around, I found that it wasn&#x27;t giving me the download because it was an OEM-license (or something), since it came installed on the DELL computer.<p>Luckily my Dad had kept the disc that came with the computer, and I used this to reinstall windows. However, like the OP, I was missing drivers for a handful of things, including the built-in wireless and wired network adapters. Luckily, before reinstalling I&#x27;d found a folder on the C drive called &quot;Drivers&quot; which looked important, and had backed this onto a USB drive.<p>The point is, the whole process took much longer than expected due it being...Windows.

Typo errors I have corrected.<p>- I think that developing software for “Windows only” is not a mistake. If you make the first version with a small team or in one person, it removes a lot of compatibility issues and problems. If the software will be successful on Windows, it can be extended to other platforms.
- &quot;It&#x27;s hard to compete with R Studio&quot; - yes it is true. Therefore, it is necessary to go a little different path. This will be visible later, after several iterations. It is now difficult to compare the first public version of FasteR with mature R Studio. But competition is always a good think.
- &quot;Excel is bad&quot; - According to statistics here is a 750M of Excel users. Every statistician knows about problems of Excel (or all spreadsheet tools). On the other hand, it is standard in a number of areas. If you look around (not only in the community of developers and designers) you will find that with Excel spreadsheets works tremendous amount of companies and institutions, particularly because of its simplicity.

Open-source in the way that I would host the product on my own servers but the full source code, except, of course, authentication info, tokens and things which shouldn&#x27;t be under source control anyway, would be available on Github. Anyone would also be able to set up a self-hosted version of the product, and if anyone wanted to contribute, I would accept pull requests, etc.<p>The idea behind that was that, since it would be targeted mostly at a tech-savy crowd and deals with personal information, I would like to introduce some level of trust that I&#x27;m not doing anything sneaky or unexpected behind the scenes (like storing information I shouldn&#x27;t be).<p>So basically I started wondering if it is possible to implement a way people could verify that the same code they see on the Github repo is the code that&#x27;s also running on the live hosted site? I will be working with node.js, but I don&#x27;t think the tech stack is too relevant here.<p>The client-side part, as I imagined it, would be relatively trivial to verify - run the build part locally, compare fingerprint of the live code and the local version.<p>But my idea got stuck on the server side. Since there, even if I would make a server side endpoint that returns the fingerprint of the live code, there is no way for someone to check what is actually going on, I could just as well return a static file with a hardcoded fingerprint.<p>I&#x27;m sure someone has dealt with or thought about similar problems before, and I would be happy to hear some insights.

I bought a toshiba s55 with Win 8.1 as a travel rig because my eeePC just wasn&#x27;t able to handle the load any more.  The Toshiba doesn&#x27;t fit as well into an airline seat, but it is a very nice setup.  I use Linux Mint in VirtualBox (my main work machine- the one I&#x27;m on now- is also Mint but as a native install.<p>In short, I&#x27;m quite pleased with win 8.1.  I like the tile stuff ok.  VBox with Mint is fast enough for development work (no usb 3 support yet).  But for the first time in years I can confidently print and scan and really get full use out of my hardware.<p>The drawback is crapware.  I apparently downloaded something called Pokki which isn&#x27;t really a virus (some people might have a use for it) but which is pretty hard to get rid of (maybe not for Win types but it took me a while).

After all, &quot;SHUT UP!&quot; is one of our most venerable and consistent themes.<p>There&#x27;s a reason for this. The reason lies at the heart of law enforcement methodology in general and federal law enforcement abuse of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001 in particular.<p>Imagine this scenario, based on an actual situation:<p>A business associate calls you and says, &quot;my dear business associate, the shit has hit the fan; Federal Agency X is investigating Project Y we did together. Two Agency X agents are interviewing people.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh coitus,&quot; says you, or words to that effect, and terminate the conversation.<p>Later that day, two well-dressed and polite agents of Agency X visit you. Because you despise me and want me to weep and gnash my teeth, you consent to be interviewed. At some point, they ask you &quot;have you talked about this investigation with anyone?&quot;<p>&quot;No,&quot; you say.<p>They smile.<p>At the end of the interview, it occurs to you to ask, &quot;Hey, am I in trouble? Do I need a lawyer?&quot;<p>The agents smirk. &quot;No,&quot; they say. &quot;I mean, unless you lied about talking to anyone about this investigation.&quot;<p>See, you&#x27;ve fallen into a false statement trap, which I&#x27;ve talked about before. The feds know that you&#x27;ve talked to somebody about their investigation. They were probably standing next to your friend when he made that call this morning. And now you&#x27;ve talked your way into a felony.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works. The feds identify some fact that they can prove. It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation. They determine that they have irrefutable proof of this fact. Then, when they interview you, they ask you a question about the fact, hoping that you will lie. Often they employ professional questioning tactics to make it more likely you will lie — for instance, by phrasing the question or employing a tone of voice to make the fact sound sinister. You — having already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer — obligingly lie about this fact. Then, even though there was never any question about the fact, even though your lie did not deter the federal government for a microsecond, they have you nailed for a false statement to a government agent in violation of 18 USC 1001. To be a crime under Section 1001, a statement must be material — but the federal courts have generally supported the government&#x27;s position that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government, but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government.<p>Hence, the government&#x27;s chickenshit false statement trap works — even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now, however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating, they&#x27;ve got you on a Section 1001 charge — a federal felony. In effect, they are manufacturing felonies in the course of investigations.<p>You think this is an improbable scenario? You think I&#x27;m talking about rare and extreme cases to color the entirety of federal law enforcement? To the contrary, as a federal defense attorney, I&#x27;m encountering this more and more often. Not to sound like an old fart, but we never indulged in such bullshit when I was a federal prosecutor (cue the scoffing from many defense attorneys). But in the last 12 years, I&#x27;ve seen it in a dozen cases, and heard about it from colleagues across the country. It&#x27;s now routine for federal agents to close out an investigation with a false-statement-trap interview of a target in an effort to add a Section 1001 cherry to the top of the cake.<p>The lesson — other than that criminal justice often has little to do with actual justice — is this: for God&#x27;s sake shut up.

With the investment, they have started to be more grown up and for my contract renewal I received a contract with new wording.<p>There is one section &quot;Ownership&quot; with three paragraphs, and all of them scares me.<p>To me it reads as they will own anything I produce during the term of the contract that is related to the line of business they are in (which can be a very broad term depending how you interpret it; and I read this as they will own stuff I do in my spare time as well).<p>Anything (code, ideas etc) I create in my spare time I have to disclose to them so they are aware of it.<p>And the final clause is that they have the right that for all eternity sign any papers in my name to protect their intellectual property rights.<p>I am now looking for advice on this.<p>Ideally I want to find some standard paragraphs that I ask them put in instead.
It should give them all the ownership of the code I produce for them, but anything that is not produced for them is none of their concern.
(With exception if it would be something that could compete with them).<p>Anyone can give pointers to where to find such standard clauses?<p>Does anyone have recommendations for someone that does review of contracts (this is a New York contract)<p>Anyone have an idea what such a review of these paragraphs (or a whole contract) would cost? (just a ball park figure would be great, since I have no idea if it would cost 50 USD or 50000 USD)<p>The rest of the contract looks fine, it&#x27;s just these paragraphs about ownership that are scary.",1426766822

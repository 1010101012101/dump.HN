7885896,comment,7884551,7884551,2,0,jordigh,,,"I have a big problem when people describe mathematics as just &quot;a language&quot;. The people who usually do this say this because they are not interested in the mathematics itself, but in some other subject that happens to require mathematics. In this case, the actual subject of interest appears to be relativity, not mathematics. It seems to me like a disrespect to say that mathematics is a language, because it seems to suggest that mathematics on its own has no substance, nothing intrinsic to itself.<p>To be sure, there is a mathematical language, a notation with much ambiguity that is typically ok when conveyed to other humans, because humans are great with ambiguity. This book is attempting to get rid of that ambiguity by rewriting it in notation that does not allow for ambiguity and present it to computers, who are still very bad at ambiguity. But this mathematical language is not mathematics, and there is real substance behind the language itself, just like poems can be translated into other natural languages or algorithms can be written in several programming languages.<p>Calling mathematics a language confuses form with substance or declares that it&#x27;s all form and no substance.",1402606681

We&#x27;ve split out the stdlib into many constituent libraries that depend on each other, and then just made the stdlib a convenient facade for these libraries. After opting out of the stdlib, you can then opt into any of the &quot;core&quot; libraries as you like, a la carte. Many of these smaller libs don&#x27;t rely on the runtime (they don&#x27;t depend on librustrt) nor do they rely on allocation at all (liballoc), and can thus be used in a freestanding environment.

I said &quot;huh?&quot; I call customer service and I found out it was because there was a chargeback.

I accidentally transposed the last 2 digits of my CC number. I combed through my CC statements and found out that I indeed wasn&#x27;t ever charged for the original items. Apparently the card was valid and was charged even though it was someone else&#x27;s card. That means they didn&#x27;t even do the least bit of checking to see if the billing address was the same or even name.<p>I call up and told them what happened.

7885705,comment,7883707,7883707,15,0,tptacek,,,"I disagree with two big points in this talk, but I&#x27;m sorry to say they&#x27;re the same two things I disagreed with last time, so this is going to be a boring comment.<p>First, dedicated AEAD cipher modes are superior to manually composing AES-CTR and HMAC-SHAx. AEAD modes provide both authentication and encryption in a single construction. AES-CTR+HMAC-SHAx involves joining two constructions to do the same thing.<p>Colin points to AES-GCM, the most popular AEAD mode, as an example of how AEAD modes can be more susceptible to side-channel attacks than AES-CTR+HMAC-SHAx. I don&#x27;t think this is a strong argument for a couple reasons:<p>* AES-GCM is so far as I can tell no practical cryptographer&#x27;s preferred AEAD mode; &quot;whipping boy&quot; might be a better role to ascribe to it.<p>* AES-GCM&#x27;s side-channel issues are due principally to a hardware support concern (GMAC, AES-GCM&#x27;s answer to HMAC, requires modular binary polynomial multiplication, which in pure software is table-driven, which creates a cache timing channel). That hardware support concern might be receding, and platforms that don&#x27;t have AES-GCM might prefer a different AEAD mode anyways.<p>* Modern AEAD modes, of the sort being entered into CAESAR, have resilience against side channels as a design goal.<p>* But the most important rejoinder to Colin&#x27;s preference for HMAC-SHAx over AEAD modes is this: HMAC-SHAx is responsible for more side-channel flaws than any other construction. Practically every piece of software that has implemented HMAC-SHAx has managed to introduce the obvious timing channel in comparing the candidate to the true MAC for a message. What&#x27;s worse is, using AES-CTR+HMAC-SHAx in practice means that the developer has to code the HMAC validation themselves; it&#x27;s practically an engraved invitation to introduce a new timing leak. Almost nobody codes their own AES-GCM.<p>I also think Colin is wrong about ECC, particular versus RSA.<p>RSA might be the most error prone cryptographic primitive available to developers. There are two big reasons for this:<p>* RSA has fussy padding requirements. The current best practices for RSA encryption and signing are OAEP and PSS (huge credit to Colin for getting this right in 2010). If you want to form an opinion about RSA, go read up on OAEP and ask yourself (honestly) if you would come up with anything resembling OAEP if you were called on to encrypt with RSA. Developers as a rule do not use OAEP; instead, most new software <i>still</i> uses PKCS1v15 padding, which introduces susceptibility to terrible vulnerabilities that can often be easily exploited in the wild. Even better are the Javascript developers who build RSA from first principles and skip the padding altogether (the fact that RSA padding is a requirement and not an annoyance to be avoided is why Nate Lawson says we should call it &quot;RSA armoring&quot; and not &quot;RSA padding&quot;).<p>* RSA easily supports a direct encryption transform, which is widely used in practice. ECC software as a general rule does not synthesize an encryption transform from the ECDLP; instead, ECC software uses the ECDLP to derive a key, and then uses something like AES to actually encrypt data. You might be thinking, &quot;that&#x27;s how RSA software works too&quot;. But RSA in practice is subtly different: you can, for instance, easily encrypt a credit card number directly using RSA, or build a crappy key exchange protocol where the client encrypts (doesn&#x27;t derive or sign, but encrypts) a key for the server. RSA and conventional DLP crypto therefore offer (encrypt, key-exchange, sign); ECC in practice offers just (key-exchange, sign). That&#x27;s one less dimension of things developers have to get right in ECC cryptosystems.<p>Colin is smarter than me and much better trained in cryptography than I am. All I do is find and exploit crypto bugs in real software. I am usually as nervous as any of you are to challenge Colin about crypto, but I think I can win these two arguments.

7885699,comment,7885312,7885312,6,0,arielweisberg,,,"I find the language regarding synchronously durable writes to be confusing. Writing to the filesystem and invoking fsync every 10 seconds is not synchronously durable. You still send a response before the data hits non-volatile media. In my mind that would make the MongoDB, Couchbase, and Cassandra behaviors roughly equivalent barring differences in the frequency with which data is synced.<p>Writing to the filesystem (without syncing) is a few hairs better than buffering in application memory, but then you are at the mercy of the filesystem blocking your party for a few hundred millis while it naval gazes at random. Not a huge deal for most workloads because you can still get great latency at 99 and 99.9, but beyond that it&#x27;s a problem.<p>Not standardizing on a specific set of commit log behavior (sync vs async, fsync frequency) is pretty egregious for benchmarking anything with a log.<p>It&#x27;s not clear from the blog post which direction you went in, relaxing durability in Cassandra or increasing durability in the others. I had to go to github to figure out that you switched to synchronous commits all around. That begs the question, were there other tunables necessary to make synchronous durability perform well? I know in some databases you can set how long the database will wait to group commit in terms of # of transactions and time.<p>Having a working group commit implementation is of course very important.",1402604274

The top end of the &quot;leaderboards&quot; is going to be a list of cheaters pretty quickly.",1402603339

I agree that having prizes makes everything more competitive and serious, but it probably also increases the overall quality of participants. A new developer with maybe a couple weeks experience probably wouldn&#x27;t bother with this hackathon but would try their hand at a hackathon that doesn&#x27;t feel as competitive. Do you want the hackathon to attract a wide variety of people or do you want to target top quality engineers?<p>There&#x27;s no right answer, it&#x27;s up the organizers. YC has chosen to attract quality, which makes sense given their business goals. An organization that teaches people to code should focus on being inclusive and avoid the competitive nature of valuable prizes.<p>To use your sport metaphor, professional sports are very competitive and attract amazing talent. But you or I would never show up to compete in a pro-sports game. We might join the game in the neighborhood park though.",1402603215

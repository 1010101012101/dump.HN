There are clear differences in personality distribution between the sexes, either due to biology or culture, that can effect their relative desire to participate in various activities. A few activities will have gender ratio imbalances, and that's not necessarily unnatural or unhealthy. Men have been doing the lion's share of hunting and war since time immemorial.<p>The problem is that CS doesn't obviously have to be one of those activities.

At the margin people choose Amazon -- resulting in lost profits/jobs for NewEgg, and lost sales/income tax revenues for the state. In some cases, this also means shipments have to go an inefficiently long-distance, because of an arbitrary legal distinction. (Though, for the bay area, Amazon's Reno distribution center is closer than Southern California.)<p>And that's just comparing online retailers; there's no reason Amazon should have such a tax-based price advantage over the bookstore a block from me, driving the local supplier closer to bankruptcy and making it cheaper for me to have a book shipped hundreds of miles rather than walking a few minutes to pick it up myself.<p>I like low taxes.

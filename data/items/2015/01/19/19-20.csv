Locking my car and worrying that I didn&#x27;t while I&#x27;m still looking at my car.<p>The good news is that when I stopped, my brain came back almost <i>immediately</i>, and in force. Basically as soon as I could tell that I hadn&#x27;t recently smoked. A few days, tops.<p>What helped me to quit the most actually was buying some horrid weed from my guy that I still insisted on smoking. The stuff was low-grade enough that I was going through slow withdrawal even during the weeks when I was smoking it. And smoking it was no fun. I know for sure that my symptoms this time around pale in comparison to the times in the past when I briefly quit (for a drug test or whatever) after smoking that bubonic chronic (SFV OG, GSC and such).",1421697570

8913696,comment,8911309,8913584,0,0,catchaway1,,,"I have a question for you actually. I have noticed things very similar to what you talk about after a few years of regular smoking. I started at 19 and I&#x27;m 21 now (edit, 22, forgot my own age). I used to evangelize marijuana since it has no overt medical side effects, but I think I&#x27;m coming to realize what you are talking about -- it kinda does make you stupid, like my Mom warned me about years ago. And not just when you&#x27;re high, either.<p>I try to mitigate the negative effects by alternating -- a month of daily smoking, then a month off. If I have any in the house, I can&#x27;t help myself, so I moderate the quantities I buy.<p>But, I have started to have episodes around things like locked doors. Did I lock the door -- or even close it? It&#x27;s like I can&#x27;t trust my previous decision and I have to go check again. Sometimes I will check a door five times in an hour. It&#x27;s basically neurotic. If I don&#x27;t check, I feel very nervous. I think this might be related to marijuana since it seems to fall into the category of absentminded behavior. It&#x27;s like I am not present in reality enough to have faith in my past decisions.<p>I definitely don&#x27;t feel stupid, but I do feel unfocused -- you could say my thoughts are accurate but not very precise. Or put in other terms, I feel like my of my intellectual powers are locked up because it feels to difficult to think about hard things.<p>Anyway, I was wondering how long you feel like it took you to &quot;get smart again&quot;, as it were. Should a month be long enough to return to a baseline state of mind? Or should I try a multiple month T break to see if it has a big impact? (If it did, I would quit).",1421697327

For regular reading I don&#x27;t care the medium but will pick ebook most of the time so that I have it everywhere I go and can read a chapter or two in the waiting room on my phone and pick up on my tablet later that night. For text books I have yet to see a good digital interface to them, mainly due to not being able to quickly jump between sections/pages. Maybe an interface where I can &quot;cut&quot; out parts of pages and organize them all on a digital corkboard is closer to what I imagine as &quot;the best&quot; way but still I&#x27;d pick book over ebook. The one other thing I will say is that I did get ebooks instead of textbooks a number of times in college because it was cheaper and I was told ahead of time that we either never or rarely use the book (but had to prove we got it or lose points in the class).",1421697323

Define what the thing does and what assumptions are made, save detail for &quot;gotchas&quot;. Be concise.<p>* Start out on a white board, run through each function, what it should do, what it shouldn&#x27;t. This really is a huge benefit of spec&#x27;ing out a api, just sitting there thinking about it, tons of stuff comes up and you come out with a better product in the end.<p>* If the format you came up with can&#x27;t be put into something like a table or spreadsheet, you probably doing it wrong. Sure you can get some sort of framework that lets you create all sorts of UML and create class/function shells or what have you, but I have never found these to create value or clarity. If you are spending more than 20-30 minutes outlining even a complicated function, your probably wasting time. Use time saved to create a clear system-wide DFD.<p>* Don&#x27;t go deep into implementation detail at this stage, but at least think about it.

But even the hype for classic MRI Ruby has been waning, as developers look to do more with concurrency, and they discover dynamic everything-is-mutable languages have limits when it comes to concurrency. See Tony Arcieri&#x27;s article &quot;2012: The Year Rubyists Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Threads (or: What Multithreaded Ruby Needs to Be Successful)&quot; and where he wrote:<p>&quot;I’m talking about at Dr. Nic’s talk at RubyConf 2011, a little more than a year ago. Dr. Nic had a fairly simple message: when performance matters, build multithreaded programs on JRuby (also: stop using EventMachine). Now granted he was working the company that was subsidizing JRuby development at the time, but I didn’t, and I for one strongly agreed with him. Not many other people in the room did. The talk seemed to be met with a lot of incredulity.&quot;<p>So even among Rubyists, there has been growing interest in Ruby beyond the MRI, and if that is happening in the land of Ruby, then the argument for Groovy is that much weaker.<p>At the same time, the growing interest in dealing with concurrency certainly helped increase interest in Scala and Clojure, and furthermore, functional programming in general. If you are a developer who wants to harness the power of concurrency for greater speed, Scala and (especially) Clojure are full of interesting ideas for how to do that. Groovy, meanwhile, feels off-topic.",1421697105

When Groovy was initially developed JRuby was (arguably) not yet mature enough for production, so developers wanting to use Rails under the JVM were basically out of luck. Grails was developed in response to this need.<p>Now that JRuby is more mature (and, as of today, the only one of the two with official sponsorship) the need for Grails is greatly diminished. The only other major development effort that utilizes Groovy is Gradle, and that has been met with mixed levels of enthusiasm. Add to this that Java itself has made some strides with adding functional(-ish) features to the language, and the benefits that Groovy brings to the table are not as pronounced as they once were.<p>And for devs who are wanting something that is more purely functional there is Scala.<p>Given this I&#x27;m not particularly surprised to see Pivotal&#x27;s decision here.

More broadly, it&#x27;s hard to imagine any consistent position under which RMS attempting to exert some <i>de facto</i> proprietary control over GCC is tyrannical, but licenses which would have given him the authority to make future official GCC versions <i>de jure</i> completely or semi-proprietary are upholding <i>freedom</i>!

I&#x27;ve sat there waiting for an image to show up on a tintype as well as on more conventional substrates. However, the process of a development is fundamentally one of transcription (with all the possibilities for selective amplification/suppression) rather than one of authorship. If I hand you an undeveloped photograph of a landscape to process, not only will you not be able to turn it into a portrait, but you won&#x27;t know what the content is until the development process is mostly complete; you are in the same sort of position as a recording engineer who can modulate the fidelity with which a musical performance is recorded to tape, but who does to thereby become an originator - s/he does not choose what is to be recorded, or perform that rendition of a composition, notwithstanding the skill involved in accurately transcribing the sound to tape.<p>ISTM that you&#x27;re overly hung up on the &#x27;expression&#x27; aspect to the point that you think authorship occurs at the moment of expressibility. I mention the tape analogy because an audio recording can not be perceived directly after fixation; you could wave a magnetometer over tape, stare at the grooves on a record, or view a printout of the waveform, but none of these would recreate the original acoustic information (although they would allow reconstruction of it). Acoustic expression only occurs when the recording is brought into proximity with a sensor and transducer - an apparatus of some kind. And whether the recording can be heard properly depends on the configuration of that apparatus - set the volume to high or too low and even the best recording will be rendered to a cacophony or a ghostly whisper. I suggest to you that the development stage of photography is no more than a chemical apparatus and the role of the lab technician is largely one of monitor rather than author.<p>While a skillful darkroom technician <i>can</i> take unexposed  film and create new images from scratch by &#x27;painting&#x27; on film and photopaper in the darkroom, and likewise <i>can</i> modify the content of exposed film using similar techniques, the <i>possibility</i> of creativity does not mean that all darkroom work is necessarily creative.

I&#x27;m sorry if this post is a bit incoherent because I&#x27;m horribly tired, still getting past the nuts insomnia phase of quitting.<p>I&#x27;ve smoked a lot of weed. Started smoking in high school, heavily when I was 19 until a couple weeks ago (I&#x27;m 26 now). About an ounce a month over that time, sometimes two ounces. First it was for insomnia, then it was supposedly for my digestive health (actually, quitting gives you gas and loose stool), then for anxiety, sometimes for aches and pains (which were made worse because of poor posture -- it is a muscle relaxant, after all). At the end it was for my paranoia, so to speak -- I was convinced I had cancer setting into my guts and that it was the weed that was keeping it in remission. They did some experiment where this worked with rats, right?<p>Right now it seems like there are no side effects. Trust me, there will be. Your memory will turn to shit and you won&#x27;t be able to follow a conversation. You will try to remember a number and forget it moments later. You&#x27;ll be slow to recall your own zip code. This doesn&#x27;t just happen when you&#x27;re high, it&#x27;ll happen the day after smoking also. Basically, if you&#x27;re feeling &quot;all right,&quot; you&#x27;ll have these effects too.<p>You&#x27;ll become dull. You&#x27;ll sit around with peers and have nothing to talk about, just a stupid smile. Now, you&#x27;ll feel totally at peace, but you&#x27;re a basically a human blob, incapable of really interesting thought.<p>Your thoughts themselves will become lazy, less rigorous. You&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re being &quot;chill&quot; when you quit a debate, but really, your mind is just working <i>much</i> slower.<p>You&#x27;ll edit code pointlessly, shuffling stuff around.<p>It&#x27;s not all bad -- the ability to come up with really funny insights doesn&#x27;t go away, so you can make people laugh. But there&#x27;s no depth to anything you do.<p>Heavy smoking makes you shiftless too, and easy to abuse. It let me stay in an abusive marriage for a few years, fun (I sort of knew this but was too embarrassed to leave this woman I&#x27;d just married, so I smoked more to keep my sanity). Only when I tried to slow down smoking for a little while did I realize how bad things had gotten. Whether or not you believe it&#x27;s happening, people <i>will</i> try to take advantage of you, if you&#x27;re worth taking advantage of.<p>Keep in mind I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;smoking every now and then when I feel bad,&quot; I&#x27;m talking about daily use: A smoke in the bathroom before you shower for work and constant smoking every night. Lunch break smoke if you&#x27;re a real go-getter. Maybe smoking on your commute. Always making sure you have a good bit of bud or hash oil before you go on a trip anywhere (I remember smoking in a company&#x27;s garage in SF after a tech meetup, and also regularly taking smoke breaks in my employer&#x27;s garage in a less tolerant state).<p>In this industry, people will let you get away with it if you&#x27;re any good, because the fact is that a half-baked person who can still write decent, reliable code is 10x as valuable as an regular guy with no skill/aptitude/motivation. And as you might have noticed, most people don&#x27;t take to this stuff all that well, which is why (compared to other working schlubs) we get paid pretty well.<p>Also, YMMV, but it completely robbed me of my sex life when sober because I&#x27;d orgasm so fast.<p>It took several years of heavy, daily smoking for these serious symptoms to fully manifest into what seemed an indomitable form, probably when I was 24-25. I know for sure that heavy daily smoking of high-grade buds in California took it to the next level.<p>I had to stop smoking. I realized how stupid I&#x27;d become, even if I was raking in the dollars (not doing consultant BS either, senior developer stuff at a good tech company and respected by my peers).<p>Holy crap, I&#x27;d forgotten how smart I was. Suddenly I could remember everything. Issue numbers. My train number. Dates, times, places. I could remember things (addresses and stuff) I learned when stoned, knowledge I didn&#x27;t know was in my head. Weird!<p>Now I can&#x27;t imagine smoking again, except rarely with friends. Having my brain back is so wonderful. Feel free to ask my questions, though I probably covered the uninteresting life of a stoner programmer pretty well here.",1421696002

Reading just one Date book [1] took me a further 3 days and allowed me to solve pretty much everything I&#x27;ve encountered since, with the occasional googling for syntax. Aside from perhaps statistical learning (reading through ISL [2] takes perhaps half a day to a day if you are committed, another day for the labs, and then you are immediately useful to most SMEs), I can&#x27;t think of a field in computer science that has such a fast ROI. Both being able to query well, and being able to build simple but accurate statistical models, are valued quite highly by the marketplace right now and naturally lend themselves to a &quot;contractor&quot; relationship. The OP mentioned making money...<p>SQL is declarative which means if you can word it in your head, you can write the query (unlike with OO where you need to define what happens to your record). If you learn it properly, from the set theoretic perspective (aka the relational model, not using the RDBMS as a data dump without FKs, and treating rows as records the OO way), you can keep working like that almost indefinitely, and the problem solving is a lot of fun - &quot;how can I define my output in terms of my input in one go&quot;. Most importantly, you KNOW your code is correct (except logical errors) whereas the ORM does not guarantee as much (my first step when at a new company that uses an OO framework is enforcing all the implicit FK constraints and keeping track of the 1-3% of tuples missing bits). Most of the time it (sort of) doesn&#x27;t matter (click through rate being off by 0.2% isn&#x27;t going to change your life); when you&#x27;re calculating how much money you donate customers via discounts or matching your orders with cash flow, it does, and this is when companies start paying good money.<p>Unfortunately, based on interviewing 200+ applicants over a couple of years to data-related positions, I&#x27;ve started to think that the relational model is simply not taught anymore, and many popular frameworks actively encourage patterns that break the model (e.g. polymorphic associations in RoR [3]). I&#x27;m now happy just to see someone aware of why constraints might be useful, let alone being able to discuss 2 vs 3 or 4 valued logic or the usefulness of prenex normal form.<p>[1] SQL and Relational Theory, C.

I&#x27;ve been a fairly avid fan of Kindles for about 4 years, but I&#x27;ve never even considered reading a textbook, programming book, or reference book in that format. All I have ever read on my Kindles are novels, comedy, popular science, and biographies, all of which are very prose-oriented and linear. One pop econ book I read recently had a lot of endnotes, which was admittedly a bit annoying, but I don&#x27;t think it would be significantly less annoying than a physical book with a lot of endnotes. Luckily the endnotes were not very crucial to the text.<p>I have purchased several physical books from Amazon and chuckled seeing them offered for Kindle. The most recent examples were a large and dense musical theory book that&#x27;s very reference-oriented and has a lot of diagrams, and a book of Bay Area hiking spots that is obviously very map-oriented and meant to be thumbed through. I can&#x27;t imagine using either on an e-reader.<p>I wish I knew more details about what sorts of material they were having these young people read, but I suspect it was largely <i>not</i> prose-oriented.",1421695591

Or that any career-minded researcher would ever take the risk of being labeled as misogynist.<p>With that said, the result itself is interesting enough. We know intuitively that women tend to make consensus decisions, and men are more individualist. That consensus building leads to measurable results in the quality of group decisions is very interesting. I wonder how those results would hold in nonWestern cultures, where men are group-oriented already.<p>Keep in mind that there is a slight bit of bias built in to the study. It provides evidence women are more adept at making group decisions (confirming our intuition), but would leave us to assume that a good group decision is the best decision. What about the decision of a single leader (where we&#x27;d expect men to have an advantage)? So an interesting follow-up to this study might be to compare the quality of group versus individual decisions.",1421695059

Are there numbers that back up this claim?<p>2.) I&#x27;ve already heard our society is in a death spiral of short-term entertainment and consumerism (and for reasons deeper than an estate tax). How do you suppose that an estate tax is somehow more fundamental?<p>> That is, people, knowing they can&#x27;t leave anything to their children, will spend as much as they can on things they don&#x27;t really need, thus provoking the wrong kind of spending.<p>Again numbers. Or any kind of precedent? Might one suggest that the children who inherit the wealth but don&#x27;t have the work ethic are provoked into the wrong kind of spending? This claim seems all the work of narrative and no work of empirical grounding.<p>> The question is, if I made my money honestly, do I have the right to spend my money as I please?<p>That is not the question. It is one question in a long list of questions. Another question is how much of a right does someone have to do &quot;A&quot; before it interferes with the rights of others (the foundation of our values) - in cases where &quot;A&quot; is wealth accumulation there does exist points at which the rest of society is hurt.<p>And in fact, nobody is suggesting that you may not pass inheritance, just that it be taxed like everything else. In fact taxed heavily.<p>> If you think I shouldn&#x27;t do that or that inheritance should be heavily taxed, you&#x27;re essentially saying &quot;even though you actually earned that money, it doesn&#x27;t belong to you&quot;, which is practically communism - I think it&#x27;s immoral, evil and unfair.<p>It is a far, far cry from communism. Remember Locke&#x27;s own concept of property - no land or wealth is owned by anyone, a person merely the products of their own labor (an apple for picking it, a crop for sewing it). The wealthy in this country and in modern capitalism have not earned the wealth by working the fields. They own the machines that work the field and pay the labor force that works the field. That is to say, they own the vaunted &#x27;means of production&#x27;. Essentially, wealth creates and captures wealth.<p>Piketty&#x27;s analysis of this is damning. Piketty&#x27;s framework is simple:<p>An individual with accumulated capital&#x27;s purpose is to live from their accumulated capital and grow the rest faster than inflation, so that their accumulation grows. When the savings rate (today for the top elite ~10%) outstrips the inflation rate (~1.2%), accumulated wealth grows. But workers wealth, which doesn&#x27;t grow at 110% per year, actually decreases to 98% a year - they must be 2% more productive every year to get a 2% raise since they do not have access to the same savings rate as the financial elite.<p>> think is immoral, evil and unfair<p>I (and others) think that children inheriting billions of dollars, giant estates, seats of corporations, and ivy league entry by birth alone is immoral, evil and unfair.<p>That is, a system which created classes of people based on dynasty rather than merit is not fabled capitalism - presumed to be based on merit.<p>What we call for is not communism, but capitalism. A capitalism where there is equal opportunity for hard workers to get ahead. Huge inheritances is one of the largest hurdles to a functioning capitalism.",1421694331

That&#x27;s one of the reasons I believe the GNU Emacs maintainer threatened to fork it, he obviously knows RMS well enough.<p>(So do I in the 1979 to late &#x27;80s period, and he&#x27;s not changed in this sort of thing.  And he was reliably reported to be like this before I showed up on the scene, by among others one of the two initial ITS TECO EMACS beta-testers.  And others I knew less well.)",1421694061

Instead I sell solutions, because a solution to a problem likely has a much higher value than the hours summed up.<p>Also, if you switch from consulting to being employed you can ask for much better terms, then anyone who had been unemployed before. Always add the term to your contract, to allow you stay self employed in addition to employement, to serve old customers. And if you leave a company, offer them a maintenance contract.<p>For employed people, sometimes the &#x27;cost of living&#x27; argument can make wonders. e.g. I once had a query from Munich, and after we went several weeks till I accepted negitiation of salary, I came up with:<p>I&#x27;ll play only €208 per month for my flat in Bremen, including heating, waste removal and water. I only pay €100 for my yacht per year, including boats house in winter and mooring in summer. Your offer sounds nice, but rentals are 5 times as expensive in Munich, then in Bremen, and I better do not talk about prices for mooring a yacht in southern Germany. Get me a similar fat and mooring in Munich, or what do you think about home office + Bahn card gold (to ride the train for free) to visit your location once a week + hotel costs.<p>And you can really get those, if you switch from consulting to employed, because the company does prefer employed.",1421694015

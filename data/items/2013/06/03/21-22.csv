They have to arrest them first and then charge them.</i><p>Yeah, that's the rub, innit?  I don't see any way to avoid a certain measure of injustice in this system.  But it does argue that if the police arrest somebody, they better be pretty damn sure they are actually guilty of a crime.  IOW, if we're going to accept this system of police, laws, arrests, courts, juries, etc., I think the bar for arresting someone needs to be pretty high.<p>But, I adhere to the basic premise that it's better for a guilty man to go free, than for an innocent man to be imprisoned.",1370296721

The A-bombs were quite unusual. They were extraordinary weapons, and would have required extraordinary justifications to use on the military, let alone on civilians.<p>(To the argument that it wasnt possible to target the military apart from civilians: thats exactly why nuclear weapons are so problematic.)<p><i>it deliberately ignores both the wide diversity of opinion which existed within Japanese leadership</i><p>An alternate interpretation is to <i>not</i> take it alone, and to see it as deliberately <i>summarizing</i> the wide diversity of opinion which was already going through the complex process that you rightly point out. News of Nagasakis destruction interrupted a meeting by the Japanese Supreme War Council, not so much about whether to surrender as about how. I dont think its facile at all to call this, in context, ready to surrender.<p>The US did not know the details of the meeting, of course, but they chose to spend 70,000 human lives on an assumption with no particular justification, while under no special immediate military threat  at that point, Japan was relatively contained, and the fear was that if left alone it would reach out again in a matter of months or decades, not weeks. The threat was diplomatic: that Japan might surrender to the USSR. That seems worth presenting as something other than the rueful conduct of justified, proportional warfare as an absolute last resort.<p>As an American, sometimes I look at other countries that havent come to terms with major war crimes  the Armenian Genocide, for example, or indeed Imperial Japans crimes in China  and I shake my head.<p>Then I remember that the US has the A-bombs on our record, and weve made it almost 70 years now without admitting as a nation (meaning in standard textbooks, in mainstream entertainment, etc.) that these were, by any sensible definition, crimes against humanity of the highest gravity.<p>Theres this objection people sometimes raise: that its easy to say these things if you werent there, if you werent under the pressures of command, knowing your nations people were dying by the day. Thats true. I dont know what that was like. Its easy for me to moralize from a distance. But that argument isnt actually justifying the act of the A-bombings, merely moderating judgment on the people who did it.

Overcommunicate with your team. For some reason most founders are really bad at this one. Transparency is your friend.</i><p>Yes, but so hard to get this right. Start this early. Things you get in the habit of holding close to the m-team will probably stay with the m-team forever. This is something that's worth to spend mental energy on early, even though it won't matter until you're bigger, because it's so hard to do once you're bigger.<p><i>15. Hire slow; fire fast. Hiring is the most important thing you do; spend at least a third of your time on it.</i><p>People say this all the time and I don't believe it really works; I thought we're be a fire-fast company when we started but discovered it's hard to be fire-fast and not sociopathic. Don't count on being fire-fast unless you're sure you can do it (for instance, because you've done it before). Weight hiring decisions that much more.<p><i>16. Occasionally think about why the 20th person will join your company.</i><p>A great question, since we've been doing that for awhile, and answering it has motivated changes in how we approach the management of the company. Asking this question constantly will help your culture.<p><i>18. Hire friends and friends of friends. Go after these people like crazy to get them to join. Some other candidate sources are ok, but I always got bad results from technical recruiters.</i><p>I think this seems true because all the conventional hiring vectors suck so badly. Have a better plan for hiring than ""friends of friends"". There is really no reason to believe that you are so central to the talent graph that your friends of friends are going to be great. What makes this worse is that relationships will queer the readings you get during your hiring process; you'll want people to work out.<p>If your hiring process is fun for the interviewers, it's probably a bad hiring process.<p><i>19. Generally, value aptitude over experience.</i><p>1000x this; this is our hiring thesis.<p><i>20. Hire people that you could describe as animals.</i><p>I don't know what this means but if I look at our top performers I would not uniformly describe them as animals. Beware irrational criteria.<p><i>28. Keep salaries low and equity high.</i><p>This is probably vitally important for the kind of company YC starts but consider businesses that won't require you to do this, because retention is very very hard too.<p><i>33. Journalists like hearing directly from founders. If you hire PR people, resist their desire to control all the contact.</i><p>Be suspicious of ideas that require you to have a PR plan.<p><i>44. Get on planes in marginal situations. In-person is still better than tele-anything.</i><p>This is true and also can be usefully flipped, ie on investors or partners; someone who is serious about doing a deal with you will get on a plane, or, simpler, can be induced to take a call on a Saturday afternoon.<p><i>57. Celebrate your wins as a company. Get t-shirts for big milestones.</i><p>Something I learned at the largest company I worked for was that it's often valuable to brand milestones in advance. People can use the brand as a shorthand. Often had the effect of assumptively closing on management buy-in; once you had the manager using the branding name for the project, they were automatically sold on the project.<p><i>60. Meetups and conferences are generally a waste of time.</i><p>Yes.<p><i>63. Be suspicious of any work that is not building product or getting customers. Its easy to get sucked into an infrastructure rewrite death spiral.</i><p>Yes.<p><i>68. Dont have a diverse culture in the early days.</i><p>Probably no.<p><i>71. On the really bad days, remember that tomorrow will be betterits hard to see it being much worse!</i><p>Since I see people asking how to find cofounders so often, here I'd like to add: you know you have good cofounders when things are going wrong for you, the world seems like it's falling apart, and you suddenly realize with great relief that there are more people who will have to melt down before anything bad happens in the company. Can you imagine feeling that way about a prospective cofounder?<p>This is why I think the cofounder matching sites are kind of silly. But I guess if it works for dating...<p><i>94.

Think about metal as if it were a malleable wax candle.<p>Not to mention that mere pressure against skin on a cutting edge effectively bends and dents the edge until it becomes dull. That's what happens to IV needles, just the pressure to pierce skin alone ruins the point. How many times do you get to re-use a safety razor after shaving your beard or legs/armpits? Was the activity really very stressful on the blade?<p>And yet, maybe you'll get 5 passes (with a multi-blade razor on a thick beard) before it's pulling at the hair and skin, and you notice it's painful to shave with.<p>So too with surgical tools. After so many cycles of cutting, then heating and cleaning, you're pressing a dull butter knife against skin and whatever else you're cutting, relying more on cutting by sheer pressure than using the sharp edge to separate the tissue.<p>And then you can't stop the bleeding because the cut was wrong, the patient dies, you get sued (you DO get sued), and maybe you lose your license, reputation, time and money.

If someone is ""ready to surrender,"" what does that mean? Well I'll tell you what it certainly doesn't mean: It doesn't mean that they've _actually_ surrendered.<p>What a lot of revisionist writings gloss over is that yes, certain parts of the Japanese leadership were ""ready to surrender."" But it is well documented that some were only ready to surrender if conditions X and Y were met. Others were only ready to surrender with conditions Z and A. And of course others weren't ready to surrender at all.<p>Yet until a credible leadership figure actually _offered_ unconditional surrender, it was going to be war as usual.<p>And so if this phrase, ""ready to surrender,"" is taken alone (notwithstanding its distinguished source), then it is facile in that it deliberately ignores both the wide diversity of opinion which existed within Japanese leadership, and the complex process which was necessary for the leadership to converge and make a firm, unified political decision.",1370293439

Facial photos, fingerprints, DNA ... things which can on the whole be obtained by just following you around (touched surfaces, fallen detritus), and which circumstances may dictate a more manipulated form of acquisition (hold face up for frontal photo, manipulate fingers for prints, mouth swab for DNA). Anything involving jabbing, yanking, or threats - no. This view does presume the existence of enough evidence for warrantable arrest in the first place, which should entail a high legal barrier: a judicially signed warrant should be required prior to arrest if possible, and acquired promptly thereafter if impractical; failure to obtain one (before or after, independent of information acquired during holding) should require immediate disposal of anything gathered including arrest record.",1370293434

If one believes that DNA will 'identify' someone arrested for assault, he must believe that it will 'identify' someone arrested for a traffic offense. This Court does not base its judgments on senseless distinctions. At the end of the day, logic will [win] out. When there comes before us the taking of DNA from an arrestee for a traffic violation, the Court will predictably (and quite rightly) say, 'We can find no significant difference between this case and King.' Make no mistake about it: As an entirely predictable consequence of todays decision, your DNA can be taken and entered into a national DNA database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason.""<p>Even in Lawrence v. Texas, when he was wrong (in the macro sense), he was right in pointing out that, despite the Court's maneuvering, its opinion left no room in the future to find gay marriage bans anything other than unconstitutional.<p>That being said, I'll go ahead and be a little contrarian. Kennedy isn't really wrong: if you accept that routine fingerprinting is okay, there is precious little you can invoke to say that routine DNA swabbing is not okay, other than the fact that DNA swabbing is far more effective.<p>The precision and effectiveness of DNA makes it scary to people, but look at the flip side. We might actually want a world where DNA is the go-to tool for convictions, because everything else is so much worse: <a href=""http://lst.law.asu.edu/FS09/pdfs/Koehler4_3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lst.law.asu.edu/FS09/pdfs/Koehler4_3.pdf</a>. If routine DNA swabs lead to the use of DNA evidence being routine, then juries might come to demand DNA evidence to deliver guilty verdicts, which would marginalize the other, highly unreliable, forensics techniques.<p>There is also an important fairness aspect: unlike eyewitnesses, DNA evidence is not subject to cross-race identification bias: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-race_identification_bias#Cross-Race_Identification_Bias"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-race_identification_bias...</a>.<p>[1] As long as the topic isn't drugs or homosexuals.",1370293408

The progress was indeed slower than what some people imagined it to be, but it is a very hard problem  . Now, Numenta has Grok and its technology will be tested in the field.

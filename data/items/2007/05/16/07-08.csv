22468,comment,21907,22183,0,0,rstuart,,,"I stumbled across Y Combinator a couple of days ago after the story on slashdot. I must admit, it drew me in instantly. Being shacked up for 3 months developing an idea for a start up with little worry about living expenses is everyones dream isn't it?<p>I live in Australia and I have an idea for a startup (which, oddly enough, has to do with internet dating which I was delighted to see is mentioned in one of the library articles) but I will readily admit the neither I nor my co-founder have any idea where to start. I am due to finish my Engineering degree in November and currently work 4 days a week for a local Engineering firm. As you can imagine this doesn't leave a lot of time for development of my idea or research of how to go about a startup.<p>Given such circumstances, a program like Y Combinator seems like the knight in shinning amour to me and I'm sure to the ""kids"" you are talking about. Its not so much the cash they inject, its the guidance and readily available support they offer which to me seems almost invaluable. <p>I can therefore see why there are people preaching that Y Combinator is ""The One True Way To Do A Tech Startup"". While I myself am not quite ready to make that claim I can clearly see where the logic behind these remarks resides. Judging by your comments BitGeek, you clearly aren't a ""kid"" but someone who has some experience in this field. I envy you and have a lot of time for any alternate routes for a startup like mine you care to suggest. But for now, from a 22 year old kids perspective that has done only a little bit of research, Y Combinator definitely seems like the best road traveled for my startup to be a success.<p>All I have to do now is apply, fly to the USA and be accepted, simple huh?",1179300730

I dont see any of you helping any of us (those not in the club).</i><p>If you're going to demand that the principals of YC help you, you might start by getting their names right ;).  They are (ordered by last name) <i>Trevor</i>, Paul, Jessica and Robert.  I think you might be confusing YEurope (that also has a Paul) with YC. <p>Realistically, I don't think you can expect them to help us on an individual basis.  They would receive no benefit from doing so, and it would just detract their time from the focus of YC.",1179300615

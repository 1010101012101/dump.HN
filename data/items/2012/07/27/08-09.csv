Many local governments - even the police are using the Internet for information dissemination.  So we are reliant upon it.  For me it's a natural replacement, it sure beats wasting reems of paper.<p>In some ways utility companies should be under tougher regulation.  I'd prefer them to be non-profits.  But you have to incentivise prospective investors some way.   Perhaps social enterprises could fill this space?  Profits could be capped at lower levels and positive reinvestment enforced.  Quite how though?  I am sure money could easily be hemorrhaged through R & D departments, maybe it should go in a general state sponsored science money pot.",1343379591

C++'s templates also use structural subtyping on type arguments. Pierce also covers the subject in TAPL.<p>> I find that this is pretty impressive as a feature on its own.<p>There are advantages and inconvenients to structural subtyping (compared to nominative): it's more flexible and has much lower overhead, but it's subject to false positives (structurally equivalent but semantically unrelated objects) and tends to have much worse error reporting. Not to mention structurally typed systems still usually have and need nominative types in their core, for ""non-object"" types.",1343377140

Some libraries have partially broken semantics that have been maintained because legacy applications rely on those broken semantics.  Python modules don't even agree on tab width or casing.<p>Part of that is youth, Go went 1.0 just this Spring, and had a serious housecleaning applied in the process.  ""Being boring"" is a big part of Go's identity -- most changes have been pragmatic and thoroughly thought out, and when they come, ""gofix"" often knows how to apply them to legacy code.  (Static linking doesn't hurt, either.)<p>In theory, Go has more to gain in performance with the GC leaving a lot of room for improvement -- CPython has been subject to a lot of tuning over the years and has found a nice local maximum to settle on.

48505,comment,48380,48380,0,0,nameless,,,"I've been analyzing slicehost and they look great, but it looks like I'll have to do too much of the server admin myself, including security. Plus, they are currently back ordered unless you prepay. Says alot for them though that they refuse customers due to server loads. <p>MediaTemple's dv offering seems to be 'dedicated light' in that apache, php, mysql etc are preinstalled. Also MT has a security update option where they updated tested versions of apps as they come out. <p>Looks like that could take alot of server admin work off my hands, which is what I'm looking for. <p>Anyone else have an easier option?",1188516644

48502,comment,48326,48361,0,0,utnick,,,"These predictions are spot on mostly<p>But... I have to disagree with your artflock prediction, I think there is a market for this. A few weeks ago I was trying to buy art from local artists on craigslist for my new apartment, it was a pain though, because I had to click on each link to see the painting, I couldn't search very easily on genre or artist, and I had to wade through a bunch of postings for van gogh posters people bought from posters.com etc<p>Not sure if this is where they are going with that service, but a craigslist for art would be helpful to both artists and buyers.",1188516163
48501,comment,48380,48487,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"I'm also very happy with SliceHost.  But you have to understand the limitations of their offering.  They're offering you a blank canvas -- an empty box with a standard Linux distribution installed.  It does <i>not</i> have any user-friendly administration tools installed, beyond what comes with the distribution.  Instead, they assume that their customers know how to manage servers themselves.  If you want more of a GUI, you can install any control panel you want, but you have to install it yourself.<p>As such, the SliceHost control panel is very minimal.  It will display some instantaneous statistics about CPU time, memory usage and network traffic.  It also lets you reboot your server and restore from backups or from a standard distribution template.  That's about all that it does.<p>That said, the control panel is very nicely done -- just minimal.<p>This isn't for everyone, but my personal feeling is that if you're in the market for a VPS, you should be familiar with how to configure it yourself.  If you're not already comfortable with Linux system administration and the Unix command line, then I think you're better off with fully managed hosting.  I wouldn't want to try and keep a VPS alive and secure without being a proficient Linux sysadmin.",1188516061

The former is true as far as I've observed; I don't have a whole lot to go on, but I've met a couple YC applicants at startup gatherings and frequent the sites of a few more, and they all seem like sharp cookies.  I never claimed the latter.  There are bound to be smart people that <i>don't</i> get into YC.  (At least, I hope so, since I've been rejected twice and have no affiliation wit yCombinator besides posting on news.YC.)",1188516034

It is achievable with today's materials. The main benefits of building a lunar elevator are two-fold: <p>1) the system engineering learning in the process would be invaluable.<p>2) Lunar material could be used to make an earth elevator.<p>This is why I'm so excited about the recent developments in lunar vehicles. It's actually much more important than anything else NASA does.",1188515706

Of course, people will confuse opinion and fact sometimes, and I would encourage people to be skeptical of themselves on delineating the two, but that doesn't invalidate the idea that people can say things that are factually wrong.<p>Yes, if someone says something that is factually correct (or at least not incorrect) based on a different world-view, then I agree, don't vote them down.  If they say something that is factually incorrect but accepted in their worldview, I don't know that that changes what I was saying before.<p>Edit: you know, it's usually my policy not to comment on how comments have been modded, but I do find it hilarious that in this discussion, someone's down-voted this comment (at the time of this edit) without replying.",1248447453

There's just something, deep down, that makes people believe that these sorts of ethereal products, or knowledge, can't or shouldn't be protected.<p>To me, the real issue is this: No one spontaneously thinks that sharing something freely sharable with friends and family and fellow humans is inherently wrong. ""Intellectual property"" is an unnatural and learned concept. If I had an infinite supply of food, I would not think twice about handing it out to others. I didn't use to, but now I do think that the problem is largely one of future shock and legislation: we simply have to come to grips with the reality that digital information will be copied, and that someone possessing a piece of digital information will expect it to be copyable.<p>So where does that leave him? I don't know. Maybe there is no decent business model for selling games like AI War in this age. Just like other business models have disappeared or, for that matter, appeared with the digital age.<p>I don't think the problem is that people in general view piracy as a victimless crime.

For them to provide <i>absolutely full</i> remuneration to you, they'd have to pay you 99¢ (which they did. Immediately). At that point all your losses are covered. You can go and buy another 99¢ book or put that 99¢ towards a fair and legal copy of 1984.<p>But you ask for more. You seem to say that in addition to their error in selling an illegal book, Amazon's also offended your sensibilities in their handling of the situation. They've issued you a frank apology and promised to do better in the future, but that's still not enough for you. You want free stuff. I can't help but see this as greedy and overreaching.<p><i>If those customers had bought an ""illegal physical copy"" from a bookstore...</i><p>The customer could have kept the book <i>or</i> returned it to the bookstore for a refund. Not both. It's true that Amazon made the choice for you, forcing you to return the book for a refund (which was in bad taste and they've apologized).<p>But it should be pointed out that if these hypothetical people had decided to keep their book instead of returning it for a refund, the book would be no less illegal. They are still at this point guilty of possessing bootlegged material. The publisher could, in theory, still go after them in a court of law. So it can at least be said that, in choosing between these two alternatives, Amazon chose the legally unambiguous one. That may turn out to not have been the best choice, but it's certainly understandable, is it not?<p><i>Amazon _shouldn't_ have the right or mechanism to do any different.</i><p>You're saying they're not allowed to build the device they want or write the software they want? You're so filled with righteous indignation over Amazon's invasion of your perceived ""rights"" that you think they should send you free books. Yet you think nothing of oppressing their own freedoms.

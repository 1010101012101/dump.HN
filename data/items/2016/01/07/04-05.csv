The &quot;down&quot; side is that people lose money from panic. But if the market goes up quickly people generally hold on to their stock waiting for it to go up still more, so there is no need to slow trading, it slows itself.<p>The apocryphal saying <i>“financial markets are driven by two powerful emotions – greed and fear.”</i> is fairly simple but it does capture the essence of the primary movers.",1452142647

Light and cheap win for speed.<p>Not sure that&#x27;s the right test... speed isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re going for.  For example, aluminum foil would very quickly conduct heat straight to the water opposite the flame, rather than distribute it broadly across the surface.<p>Because heat transfers fastest across the gradient where the temperature difference is greatest, foil would win the day even though it&#x27;s a terrible cooking surface.<p>A heavy copper pan would evenly distribute the heat it&#x27;s given to the sides and all over the bottom rather than straight to the bottom.

He briefly touches some points related to copyright and claims that that&#x27;s all there is to it.<p>> Myth #5. Artists Feel Restricted by Copyright<p>Remixing works under copyright means you need the author&#x27;s permission to do so, usually by paying royalties. This would be fine if copyrights ended at some point. Currently, in the US, they last way past the death of the author.<p>> Myth #4. Copyright Harms the Public Domain<p>He mentions The Little Prince as if all works are really popular. There are tons of works that are not popular, their authors don&#x27;t even care about them anymore or are dead or companies have gone bankrupt, and remain under copyright. This makes it illegal for people to make copies and keep these works alive. Access to such usually also requires payment and what&#x27;s affordable for some may not be so affordable for others.<p>> Myth #3. Copyright is an Attack on Artistic Freedom<p>He only mentions the freedom of the original author. Indeed, their freedom is not touched. Everybody else is hurt, though. Nobody else can express their artistic freedom on works under copyright without permission (which usually means paying royalties, but can also be impossible if the author doesn&#x27;t approve the derived work).<p>> Myth #2. Copyright Costs Consumers<p>Nobody argues that authors need to be compensated for their work. How much is &quot;fair&quot; is a whole different story. Should they keep being compensated 25 years, 50 years, 100 years, 500 years, forever?<p>> Myth #1. Copyright only helps Corporations<p>Copyright, in general, is a good thing. Perpetual copyright is not. Copyright that extends beyond the life of the original author is not. After some time, only corporations will benefit, since their heirs will live much beyond the original authors and will profit on someone else&#x27;s work.<p>EDIT: Here&#x27;s a nice video on why eternal copyright is bad: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk862BbjWx4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk862BbjWx4</a>",1452141818

The world will mostly seem to slow down. A very conceivable outcome is one of boredom and possibly madness. You could perhaps multi-task and think of many different things, but we are generally terrible at multitasking, so we have no idea whether an intelligence even <i>could</i> multitask well.<p>Another problem is that we don&#x27;t know anything about the information capacity of a mind. A faster mind of the same size could potentially have trouble dealing with all that extra information (again -- madness, maybe?)<p>One thing that hints at those capacity limits is the need for sleep. We don&#x27;t know why, but some hypotheses say that it&#x27;s necessary to do some &quot;information cleanup&quot; operations in the brain. It is possible that an AI would need to sleep, too. The AI may need to sleep a lot more to handle much more information.<p>It is therefore conceivable at least that a mind has to work at a speed that is commensurate with the speed of the world around it, and one that is appropriate for its capacity.",1452141620

They had previously inflated a massive property bubble, both residential and commercial, that was in the process of exploding and severely damaging the economy. The stock market bubble they intentionally created, was meant to offset that event (perhaps both economically and psychologically). As the stock market bubble began, people shifted their capital from housing to stocks - many were relying on the perpetual upward movement to keep themselves solvent vs the losses in their real estate assets.<p>China is still a heavy-handed command economy in many ways. The Communist Party&#x27;s reputation and &#x27;people authority&#x27; is directly tied to the economy delivering continual material progress gains (which the party then takes a lot of credit for, with the downside being the implied responsibility if things go badly). The desperation stems from 2007-2009, when the global economy crashed, and ended their over-boom (some of it was fake, backed by highly leveraged consumers and a slightly cheap currency that had been pegged to an artificially cheap dollar). At that point, China made a decision to inflate bubbles rather than accept much slower growth. The real estate bubble bought them a couple of years before it turned back against them.<p>China is now eating through their capital reserves rapidly, while trying to prop up the most over-valued stock market on earth, and simultaneously dealing with a manufacturing sector that has been shrinking for five straight months (to go with the big bust in several specific segments like steel). They&#x27;re trying to fight reality, when they should have instead learned from Japan&#x27;s similar past mistakes in trying to prop up fake growth with bubbles (China is even making the same zombie corporation mistakes that Japan did).",1452141576

[0][1][2]<p>> But drivers have been incurring all sorts of risks when they use their personal vehicles for TNC work. During Period 1, Uber and Lyft do not offer collision (coverage for when the policyholder is at fault), comprehensive (for fire, theft and other damage), underinsured motorist coverage or medical payments.  (They also do not offer those coverages for the succeeding periods, unless drivers carry them on their personal policies).<p>> The new insurance is offered by Farmers as a supplement — called an endorsement — to drivers’ personal auto policies, and it will cost an additional 8 percent of their premium. A smaller insurer, MetroMile, already offers individual ride-service insurance, but it’s exclusive to Uber drivers. That insurance costs a base rate plus a per-mile charge.<p>Yes, your article agrees I&#x27;m correct despite you arguing with me for some bizarre reason(?)<p>The drivers themselves need to buy supplemental insurance or there is a gap in coverage during Period 1.",1452140765

10855950,comment,10850205,10855795,0,0,frankpf,,,"I&#x27;m not an expert in Idris, but I will try to answer this as best as I can.<p>That&#x27;s the Haskell type notation (Idris and Haskell are similar). Here&#x27;s an example:<p><pre><code>  plus5 :: Int -> Int\n  plus5 n = n + 5\n</code></pre>\nThe first line is the type declaration of the `plus5` function. You can read it as &quot;plus5 takes an Int as argument and returns another Int&quot;. The second line is the function declaration. The equivalent in Python would be:<p><pre><code>  def plus5(n):\n      return n + 5\n</code></pre>\nThe syntax is the same when functions have more arguments:<p><pre><code>  add :: Int -> Int -> Int\n  add a b = a + b\n</code></pre>\nThis means that add takes two integers as arguments and returns another integer. This syntax might look strange (you could be asking yourself &quot;How do I distinguish between the argument and return types?&quot;) but that&#x27;s because in Haskell functions are curried[1].<p>Haskell (and Idris as well) also has parametric polymorphism, so you can define functions which operate on generic types. For example, the identity function:<p><pre><code>  id :: a -> a\n  id x = x\n</code></pre>\nYou can read this as &quot;`id` is a function that takes an argument of type a and returns another argument of type a (so the return type and argument type must be the same)&quot;. This means the id function will work for any type of argument (String, Float, Int, etc.). Note that of course this <i>is not</i> dynamic typing, Haskell and Idris are statically typed and therefore all the types are checked at compile-time.<p>Now, let&#x27;s move on to Idris. One of the reasons there&#x27;s a lot of excitement over Idris is because it has dependent types, i.e., you can declare types that depend on values and these are checked at compile-time.<p>The example GP gave was this:<p><pre><code>  app : Vect n a -> Vect m a -> Vect (n + m) a\n</code></pre>\n`app` here stands for append. This is the function that appends two vectors (lists of static length) together. In Idris, `Vect x y` is a vector of size x and type y, so<p><pre><code>   Vect 5 Int\n</code></pre>\nis a vector of 5 integers. So, essentially, `app` is a function that takes two vectors as arguments, `Vect n a` and `Vect m a` (this means they can be of different sizes but their content must be of the same type). It returns a `Vect (n + m) a`.<p>Think about it for a minute. That is amazing! We can be sure that, at compile-time, just by looking at the function signature, our append function, given two vectors of size n and m, will _always_ return a vector of size (n + m).<p>If we accidentally implement a function that does adhere to the type specification (for example, it appends the first argument to itself, returning a Vect of size (n + n) instead of (n + m)), the code will <i>not</i> compile and the compiler will tell us where is the bug.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions#curried-functions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com/higher-order-functions#curried-f...</a>",1452140195

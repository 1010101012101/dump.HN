The fact that only a manually counted result would have legal standing ensures nobody will see the point in tampering with the digital counter.<p>I would agree that there's no reason to have e-voting instead of paper ballots. The only possible excuse I might imagine for e-voting is that it lets people vote from home which enfranchises more voters, but that would just lead to a wave of vote selling so...",1366577997
5586389,comment,5585535,5585535,1,0,graeham,,,"PERT [1] is a good technique, especially for parallel tasks, depending somewhat on how complex (how many) tasks need to be done.  It is like a Gantt chart but IMHO better displays the data and dependencies and allows for additional information or referencing within the items.  One of its downfalls can be when things change on the fly, but it should be possible for a software implementation to fix that.<p>I'm not aware of any software implementations, but I'd be surprised if there aren't any.  Many applications need multiple tasks completed in convoluted series/ parallel.  The automation industry does a lot of this kind of stuff for one, I am sure there are others.  If not, it should be reasonably easy to make such a thing..<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Evaluation_and_Review_Technique"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Evaluation_and_Review_T...</a>",1366577954

So glad you understand.<p>It hasn't been a free market since we created the FDA (and I'm not looking to get rid of it), and with patents and advertising law, etc, it's never going to be free.<p>So why don't we change the accounting? Instead of making drugs companies advertise and exploit to be able to pay the regulatory costs, and R&D, etc, why not recognize that they create drugs for us and this is our hurdle - not theirs.<p>We want the product, so we shouldn't dump costs on the drug companies and pretend we've dealt with them.<p>So we should pay for the regulatory testing. 100%.<p>But that leaves an inventive to push expensive and unneeded or dangerous drugs through the system because they don't pay and yet get rewarded. So we need to make these our drugs - by paying for the R&D up front, so that there's no need to game our own system.<p>Now there's no need for secrecy so there's no need for patents to reward letting it go, and everything gets simpler again.<p>When you strip the patents, the marketing, and the legal games, our drugs would get a lot cheaper and more reliable.<p>We'd still be paying for all, maybe even more, tests, but at least we wouldn't have to trust someone whose motive clearly (and reasonably in this system) is to rush to market.",1366577365

That's how Ruby found a good use in servicing web apps, first with CGI and then with dedicated instances in Rails and the like.<p>Now with Dart I understand that people demand languages be architected in different ways to extract more performance from them.

My code was poorly optimized, but with some careful forethought, python's bottlenecks were not too problematic.<p>The first two parts were very easy with only brute force by working thru the square root of the full range once, caching the numbers, and using that cache. I don't see why people (including the auhor) recalculated the numbers for each goven range, especially in part B which required 10k such ranges.<p>That said, my python code, as a relative newbie, took 10s to cache all fair and square numbers from 1 to 10^14. I ran thru from 1 to 10^7, checked if palindromic using strings, and if good checked the square.  (there were only 39 such numbers in total). I then ran all 10k answers in seconds.<p>Part C was MUCH more tricky, until I discovered the same trick most others found, that only some of the square root palindromes are valid with digits 0, 1, and 2.  That said, as a python n00b, my code took 40 mins to run the range from 1 to 10^100. I asked the google staff if pre-caching is allowed, and they said yes, as long as my code to generate the pre-cache is provided wih my submission.<p>Properly optimizing my python would probably give similar performance.

These tasks can be used if for some reason we couldn't do part of the nominal procedure, or if we get the nominal procedure done vastly ahead of schedule and want to use the EVA time we already had book kept.<p>If, say, EV1 is 30 minutes ahead of EV2 and would otherwise just be waiting for EV2, we could send EV1 to do one of these extra tasks. In those cases normally we won't rewrite the procedure in anyway. A voice call will be made to the Flight Director (which everyone in mission control can here) saying something like ""After EV1 completes step 45 he will have to wait for EV2 to complete step 56. We estimate that EV1 would be waiting 30 minutes. As such, we suggest he procede to Get-Ahead procedure 'Install Widget' on page 33""",1366574805

Maybe my answer can help someone else wrap their head around why they want it.<p>I have been kicking around this idea for a utility to help people communicate in cooperatives and other small organizations. (Yes, I'm planning groupware. Forgive me.) These organizations tend to need much less immediate communication, and much more broadcasting. They also tend to be susceptible to stress because house business <i>is</i> personal sometimes.<p>People broadcast policy proposals, ask for rides, ask questions about specific topics like kitchen maintenance, etc. One thing that people seem to prefer, also, is the ability to organize, sort, filter on their end.<p>I was a junior in HS with dialup when Twitter debuted at SXSW, so I didn't get it then; now, though, I see that just about all asynchronous communication is tantamount to merging, filtering, accumulating, and transforming lists / streams. Thanks to optional metadata, you can use the same transport to allow applications to communicate. Or let applications read the human data. Etc.<p>And App.net is that from what I gather. Maybe it was obvious to everyone but infrastructure like this is potentially a valuable commodity. It's not just about micro-blogging. There will, hopefully, be many awesome applications of sending data and queries out into the ether and things getting to where they need to be.",1366574533

For instance, if I never learned how to write a G ""correctly"", I could still take notes and do just fine in the rest of my life. Teaching that ""skill"" is a waste of time. Handwriting learned on your own would be good enough for your purposes. Communcations with other people today requires a separate set of skills - typing, writing, speaking, even debating - that aren't taught enough. Instruction in handwriting is a waste of precious time - developmentally and socially - when there are better alternatives.",1221403345

But the non-humble person will insist on trying to teach the other person, or tell the other person how things should be done, even when his opinion is not solicited.",1221403289

When's the last time a kindergartner, or any elementary student for that matter, was required to take a typing class? And yet, those students learn to type at a passable level.<p>Teach touch typing instead. The children will learn the same fine motor skills but with something that will be much more important throughout the rest of their lives.

I can write clearly if I slow down. When I write out math, each symbol means more. I don't have to write as fast, and getting the exact symbol correctly means more, so it's slow and clear.",1221402964

Social features are not great if you shoe-horn them in a totally inappropriate way that doesn't add value.

303764,comment,303661,303661,0,0,lethain,,,"I use PyObjC, and it's makes Cocoa development quicker and less painful, but it isn't a replacement for knowing Objective-C. Especially when you get into the CoreGraphics stuff and occasionally crash through the floor into OpenGL, Python isn't going to save you (much to my regret).<p>Despite the negative hype against HTML/JS, it isn't hard to create cross-browser code using that combination. I wrote a project called sparklines.js a while back, which uses the canvas element and it renders appropriately on all major browsers (including IE using <a href=""http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/</a>). The speed of javascript is going to be sufficient as well for anything except the most extreme projects (I also wrote ptdef.com, which is a tower defense game in html/javascript. It plays poorly on I.E. but fine in more modern browsers, and its far more complex (pathfinding, etc) than the JavaScript you'll probably be dealing with).<p>Beyond that, using an html/javascript combination you can create content that renders correctly on the iPhone, in desktop applications (well, at least on OSX you can use the WebView to render arbitrary html/css/javascript), and on the web. It's also an open stack, which is my largest complaint against AIR.<p>In the end, though, I think the hard part should be developing the underlying algorithm to display the visualizations you are interested in, and transplanting it to another platform later shouldn't be impossible. Where you start out really depends on what you want to build. ;)",1221401988

While that should be the congress, they've already shown they're not willing to do the job. But military officers have been consistently willing to stand up to abuses.

</code></pre>
A productivity issue that doesn't get discussed often is the bridge between software and the people who work with it. For example - developers often draw the line at ""works on my machine"" or ""I can deploy it to production"" or ""I can work out bugs"". But these things don't take into account the scenarios of customers, deployers and support operators - documentation, logging, troubleshooting and the amount of time spent by those customers and anciliary staff doing those things. Effectiveness at these things is generally far more important than whether a programmer can write something in one day or five, but the typical developer is a blinkered creatures.",1234612283

I don't get that impression from some of the founders I'm reading on HN though.  I certainly appreciate the stories but the impressions I get, and this may be incorrect, is that they are taking credit for the ""design"" (in the overall looser sense of the term) of their product when they have just given broad reaching goals and let the actual employees make all the little decisions that make or break the product.",1234612083

Here is a quite from WP:<p>> Currently, Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations.[5] Within the greater Latin American context it leads in terms of human development, competitiveness, quality of life, political stability, globalization, economic freedom, low perception of corruption and comparatively low poverty rates.[7] It also ranks high regionally in freedom of the press and democratic development.<p>During the Pinochet era the economy grew and created a stable base for the current day Chile.

If cars were sold the way Dell laptop computers are sold (no test drive, shipped to you door), they might be less expensive. If cars were not built to last so long, they might be less expensive. If people were to buy cars more often, they might be less expensive. If people were less willing to keep old cars on life support, new cars might be less expensive.<p><i>If I'm going to spend $30k</i><p>Not every car costs $30,000.

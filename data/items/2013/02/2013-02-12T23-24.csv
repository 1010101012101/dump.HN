5210418,comment,5205506,5209593,3,0,ealloc,,,"Bitcoin's fiscal policy is only one part of the whole bitcoin idea. It is possible to change the fiscal policy while keeping the rest of the crypto-based system.<p>The fiscal  policy is controlled by two numbers which are chosen by 'consensus' among bitcoin users: The reward for mining a block, and the 'difficulty' of mining a block. You can always mine blocks in violation this consensus (eg reward yourself too much), it's just that no one will listen to you, and no one will accept the bitcoins you 'mined'. However, If everyone agreed to change how we choose these numbers, we could change the policy.<p>I'm pretty sure you could set up a 'bitcoin-2' network which would honor transactions from the original bitcoin network into the new network, yet have different algorithms for reward and difficulty. For now though, it doesn't matter since the current 'fiscal policy' is quite expansionary.",1360713564

By being compulsory, and children living in a culture of school being a hardship and burden rather than a means to create an educated society rather than sending them to work in a coal mine at age 10, you breed indifference and hostility. The system itself being the most bogged down bureaucracy in the nation doesn't help placate that feeling.<p>I think the most important take away is this: it will be slow. It will take decades, not months, to fix the absolutely broken public education system in the US. It is entrenched, and has a lot of powerful figures perpetuating its execution in its current form. But one day, we will have to realize that the best way to ""teach"" is to let the students themselves find passion and pursue it, and that if you accentuate those passions with supplemental factual and rigorous training and teaching, you get the best education you can.<p>The only successful education is when you produce someone who wants to learn, has passion, and can interact with society to a similar degree of intellectual prowess. Memorizing the periodic table or knowing how to derive the Sine function don't contribute to that at all (unless of course the students want to be Chemists/Pharmacists/etc or Mathematicians / Musicians / Acoustic Engineers/etc).<p>But yeah, assembly line education is awful for everyone involved.",1360713321

5210384,comment,5208461,5208891,2,0,silencio,,,"> it's fueling demand for good exclusive secular schools<p>I went to programs for the ""highly"" gifted as part of LAUSD (the largest school district in the US), half of it under NCLB. I watched my high school's program's decline firsthand in the first years of NCLB, as teachers went from actually teaching and not restricting us to what we have to learn, to teaching to tests instead. It was pretty much gutted in the last several years due to lack of teachers and funding - and that was despite the ongoing donations made by parents and alumni to supplement the program (such as buying new textbooks and specialized equipment).<p>Keep in mind this was a program of maybe 350 students in a 4000+ student high poverty school.. at most a 10% that scored so highly on tests that we skewed the performance numbers for the entire school. National Merit Scholars and SAT 1600-ers (perfect score then) with full AP and beyond AP courseloads destined for Ivies mingled with some of the most impoverished students and low performers in the entire district for lunch.<p>The biggest alternative that I recall was a private school many of my friends ended up going to - Harvard Westlake, with a then $25k/year tuition now I think more like $35k/year. Admission to both my public program and that private school was very competitive, with waitlists and whatnot. I think there still are waitlists for my old program, even though it's a shadow of what it used to be. But really, it's just one among the many if not most gifted/magnet programs in LAUSD in the same situation.<p>Where is this incredible demand for good schools now? Where is the support to maintain existing good schools? Most importantly, where is all of this for the average American student instead of the few with resources that you can't even begin to imagine (read: ones that can afford $35k/year tuition and private tutors)? All I'm seeing now is a sea of mediocrity outside of a handful of teachers, programs, and schools that have prospered so far, and it's generally the community that's helping them more than the state or federal government. There is rarely a benefit to outperforming beyond measure when everyone is focused on the people that can't even meet minimums. :(",1360713193

Every big studio has an iDevice team and there are hundreds of good iPhone games out there. If Apple can position the AppleTV as a console (maybe open it up to developers) or build something more along the lines of a traditional console, they will crush.<p>You can already do cool stuff like stream the game to the TV via airplay and use the device for a score/map screen (basically a WiiU) and it works surprisingly well and doesn't need cords or anything.<p>The only other real competitor here I see is one of the bigger android vendors like Sony or Samsung.  If Sony could get the company in shape and stop producing products that compete with each other, they have many of the same advantages as Apple.  They have android devices, experience making console/tv/etc hardware and even own game studios. They make every kind of electronic that goes in the tv room. But Sony has had this for years so that seems unlikely.  They have already had huge employee slashes and are floundering.<p>Samsung has the same thing going on. They make everything and they have huge android phone/tablet penetration.  I could see them easily jumping in on this and I hope they do.  More competition blowing the doors of this stagnant industry could lead to a renaissance of smaller game studios.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> I should add that Valve also has a chance here. There are many rumors swarming about a valve console or something similar. They have the distribution system and the games market experience, but have no experience with how to make hardware.

I know about him because2 or 3 days a week he shows up at my local post office right before it shuts, with a net bag that has 5-10 boxes in which he is shipping out to customers. He knows everyone at the post office by name and always gives them a big hello; he has printed and affixed the postage at his home/workshop, but brings them to the post office so he can see the tracking numbers get scanned. As there is no paperwork to fill out, and they know him, he gets handled almost immediately - typically someone will come out to scan the packages when they hear him arrive.<p>And since there is usually a line of people at the post office near closing time, invariably someone asks what it is that he's shipping (because it's unusual to see someone turning up with a bag of packages like Santa Claus). And he tells them what he does. Strangely, he never has any business cards on him (people always ask). So he asks them to give him their phone number instead. And they do. Now, I'm going froma  small sample, but I've seen this repeat itself often enough to think of it as a schtick; at a conservative estimate, every time he drops off his packages, there's a 50% chance that he gets one new customer lead. He sells the bottles for ~$25-50 depending on the size, and marginal costs are pretty low. I'd say he's doing pretty well at his craft business, since he's shipping out a few hundred $ worth of product every time I see him, and more to the point he seems like he's having a really good time.<p>Obviously this sort of thing doesn't scale well, and imposes a ceiling on the amount one can earn. But as Adam Smith observed, while the division of labor may be highly efficient it's also soul-destroying.

He's 29 and has shown no progress, and you seem to be surprised that he's expecting progress.<p>We can mock his douchey goals, and perhaps we should, but the fact is that a whole generation was bred for executive positions that are no longer available (and shouldn't exist).<p>What he probably needed to do, in order to pursue his douchey vision of a cushy cigar-smoking executive job, was get an investment banking or management consulting job. Those aren't my favorite industries, but a few years of time in them will open the kinds of doors he wants. The BMW and the fatal heart attack at 45 could be his, if he had made the right moves years ago. However, it's too late for him now. With an empty resume, he can't compete against 22-year-old college grads. That's just how it works.<p>In the <i>Mad Men</i> era, a college degree got you a junior executive job. You became an ""account executive"" or a marketing person. Sure, you were still someone's bitch-- being at the bottom of the executive-track totem pole-- and you probably had no direct reports, but you were on a track toward something better.<p>Those junior executive jobs are gone. Why? After 3 decades of downsizing, the corporate ""fat"" has been trimmed. That's probably a good thing, but what it means is that all those junior-executive jobs have been filled by people who used to be senior executives. Companies don't have the slots to take on 22-year-old proteges anymore. Again, it's probably good for the world that we're not generating all these supernumerary ""executives"" who do nothing but annoy the people doing the actual work, but it's not good for people who were bred (through parental expectations and undergraduate education and, in some cases, graduate degrees) for these positions.<p>Undergraduate college is the <i>liberal</i> arts. (Sciences are liberal arts.) ""Liberal"" in this sense has nothing to do with political ideology, but rather means ""for the free"". The contrast is <i>servile</i> arts.<p>It makes me angry when self-righteous Baby Boomers complain about ""entitled"" Millennials. On Sunday, they write on the Internet about these supposedly entitled schmucks who won't settle for anything less than a career-track job. Then on Monday, they turn down the 27-year-old barista who <i>did</i> take one of those crummy jobs and now has ""no relevant work experience"". They made and supported this world and they can fucking eat it.<p>The real problem is that the whole concept of ""management"", in the traditional sense, has become pointless.<p>College breeds you to be one of three things: (A) an academic or researcher, (B) a highly-skilled professional with high autonomy, or (C) a manager. Class A is dying out. Class B is losing autonomy, as the professions are eroded and traditionally intellectual fields (e.g. software engineering) are commoditized in an idiotic lurch toward a manage-or-be-managed corporate world, and class C is becoming obsolete enough that these junior executive jobs don't make sense and have been cut.",1360712313

5210306,comment,5210008,5210171,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is the promise of things like the Oouya console but they have yet to be proven commercially viable in the market.<p>There are some interesting forces at work here. The amount of time and effort needed to build a truly cutting edge game console has historically been high, further tools to get the most performance out of the hardware have required similar investments in expensive engineering time. This combined with selling the consoles into a very price sensitive market.<p>In order to recoup those costs, given the market realities, the console makers have traditionally resorted to extracting a 'tax' out of the game developers. On the theory that charging a few extra $ for your game to cover the cost of the tools / access is possible, whereas trying to fund the tool development on the back of base console sales is not possible.<p>Historically this has been the PC's ""secret"" weapon against game consoles for a long time. The cost of building tools was offset by developer fees across a much wider base of developers. ""Free"" tools were good enough if the hardware was sufficiently over powered, and gamers would spend $3500 on a machine that ""normal"" people would budget < $1000 for. That makes things flexible.<p>Then there are the phone games, which like PC games, have the advantage that the phone is useful for other stuff and there are more developers trying to write apps for it.<p>Ooya's promise is that the existing Android infrastructure / developers will support tool development, and the wide variety of handsets will constrain there efforts to work on systems that are similar to the modest abilities (relative to all android platforms) of the Ooya console.<p>So to respond to the articles point, the reason you cannot write a game for Xbox using $100 worth of tools is because if Microsoft only got $100 from everyone writing a game for the Xbox you would not have enough money to actually create the tools, much less support them decently. Their best effort at this was XNA but they have since killed that due to lack of adoption, if you are EA you can pay big bills, if you aren't, there are not enough of you to pay any bills.",1360712126

However, I feel there's a tension between the complexity of an application and the affordances it provides.

In my experience, the xBox doesn't manage this complexity poorly.<p>That being said, the author has a strong point in regards to the indie game market.

On the other hand, I am not sure how you can defend the idea that a student who fails to complete a time-wasting assignment should be punished, which is what you seem to be saying, when your own teaching style seems to be based on trying <i>not</i> to waste students' time.  Nor am I sure how you can reconcile the idea that time-wasting assignments indicate a poor teacher with the notion that students should be completing those assignments.<p>Now, as for my reading comprehension, the way I read what you wrote is this:  students should do as they are told <i>because</i> compliance is necessary for a school to function, even if they are told to work through a time-wasting assignment.  I am still not sure that is the wrong way to interpret what you are saying.  What I see in your comments is the idea that it <i>should</i> be entirely the teachers' responsibility to ensure that students are learning, and that students should just do what their teachers command regardless of whether or not they actually learn anything from it (feel free to correct me if this is not your view).  Thus a student who does not bother with pointless exercises that have no educational value is just as wrong as the teacher who gave those exercises, regardless of whether or not the student is learning in lieu of doing their official assignments.<p>For what it's worth, if I had you as a teacher back in high school, I probably would have done well, at least based on what you said elsewhere.",1360710501

Since there's a pile of posts on the front page right now about how Excel is supposed to stink for business apps, let's turn to the logical alternative for trivial-to-create internal applications: Access.  To which the Libre/OpenOffice alternative would be...okay, I guess Base?  But is this thing a front-end to existing database systems, or is it its own database system?  HSQL seems like the default; can I email this around?  Why are the functions with this different than with the one Greg made that isn't on HSQL?  And how do I script this, exactly?

LibreOffice Pivot Tables (formerly called something like Data Navigator or Data Pilot) are slower, vastly harder to use, and horribly underfeatured compared to Excel's Pivot Tables.  The layout quality of LibreOffice's word processor compared to Word's is almost as bad as Word's to TeX's, which unfortunately also translates to the presentation module, making it easy for me to see from a mile away whether someone used Keynote, PowerPoint, a custom HTML/CSS solution, or LibreOffice.<p>Open source improves, but ultimately, non-commercially-backed open-source improves in ways that make the <i>developers</i>' lives more interesting.

All the points in the article regarding the UI are spot on - it is TERRIBLE to use. Nintendo's UIs are no reference either, but at least they're functional, while Sony's XMB is actually quite good (although the PS Vita's OS is a horrible thing to behold, which is scary for the PS4).",1360710401

Well, i definitely agree on that the pattern/trend of auto-generating getters, setters and constructor parameters for every attribute in a class without considering if those attributes should be visible (or, worse, mutable) from the outside is pretty hideous.<p>About the nullary constructor + init() method for deserializing purposes, i don't have any strong opinion really, as long as consistency is kept throughout the code base/module that relies on that. Using Java's reflection API though, you <i>can</i> extract all necessary type information from non-nullary constructors in order to call them with the required dependencies, which is not essentially more complicated than instantiating the class and then setting its properties thought setter methods.",1360710310

You're talking about people who are underpaid, who face being laid off on a yearly basis, and who have too many pupils in their classrooms.  What you're asking for -- a system that recognize's each individual's capacity and inclination and tailors the learning experience accordingly -- is a joke.  Given the constraints, the only thing you can hope for is to try to present a curriculum which will be as effective as possible across as many students as possible.<p>Students of the type you're talking about would best be served by being home schooled or attending private school.

These are much more common than you probably realize, even within the tech sector.<p>Getting really big then exiting basically necessitates that you have to be in a mass-market business. But do only mass-market businesses get to call themselves start-ups? Is there no place for start-ups in specialized fields with significant revenue potential but without the kind of universal applicability that makes VC's wet their pants?",1360710004

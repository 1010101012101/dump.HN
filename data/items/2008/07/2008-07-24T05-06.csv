The article glosses over this, but no one set out to find a function that produced only primes; it just so happened that when enumerating these minimal functions this one was discovered to have a peculiar regularity.<p>By the way, if you ever discover an efficient way to generate primes, you have a shot at claiming a 100k prize (<a href=""http://www.eff.org/awards/coop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eff.org/awards/coop</a>)",1216879198

If inflation is at 4% your ING account is worthless and you're spending down your principal in real terms.<p>Believe me, I've been thinking a lot about that recently.<p>That said, your point is taken: There <i>is</i> some amount of money where you can set up some fairly risk-free, static investments and take out $X every year indefinitely. Just make sure you do a <i>little</i> more thinking upfront about how much money that is, and what static investments those are.",1216879123

255114,comment,254813,254897,0,0,h34t,,,"I tried to leave the following comment at TechCrunch (hasn't been posted yet). Maybe it's written in a poor tone (more patient, perhaps?) but I didn't have time to rewrite it again.<p>""Why wouldn’t Cselle wait for his payday and then jump ship to start his own company"" -- have you considered the possibility that the human spirit does not run on cash and reason alone? That it's not implausible to leave money on the table and gamble on something new, for the sake of happiness and passion?<p>""Cselle likely wants his own shot at glory, and because of Xobni’s quick rise to success, members of the team may believe that launching a startup is far easier than it really is."" -- Why jump to conclude that this move is egotistical and naive?<p>I'm also leaving my present company (in a minority shareholder, VP role) just a couple weeks after Gabor -- mid-September. It's well-funded (not a tech company so not relevant to Techcrunch) and has excellent prospects in a massive and growing industry. When I leave, I am going to be rather poor -- none of my shares will have vested -- and with few obvious prospects. It's the most gut-wrenching decision I've ever made -- I spent two years full time pouring my sweat into this thing on both sides of the world, making countless sacrifices. And business-wise, my efforts were not in vain -- the business is poised to do very well... but over the past several months, I too have found myself deeply unhappy with where I am -- disconnected with the energy that caused me to enter business in the first place, which was to express myself creatively _in leadership_.<p>If he feels trapped rather than emboldened in his current role, then all the power to him to seize back control of his life and try to make his dream work. I'm sure it hasn't been an easy decision for him, because when it doesn't make sense to outsiders, it probably doesn't make sense to the rational part of <i>him</i> either. I've found it almost indescribably hard to leave a great team working on an exciting, successful project -- especially when I know that my decision will probably not make a lot of sense to outsiders. But sometimes you have to go beyond rational economic outcomes and listen to the part of you that gives you meaning.<p>Better that, than become one of the countless people in the herd who has goals where his heart used to be.",1216879013

255111,comment,254813,254813,0,0,maxklein,,,"The real story behind this: The top management at Xobni does not want to implement much needed changes to the flawed product. Gabor has been making suggestions, but the company has already become slow and sluggish, and there was a lot of conflict between the two. Some words were exchanged, and now Gabor is leaving. The real story is that internally, one other person (at least) is no longer actively involved in the project...",1216878885

255109,comment,254877,254984,0,0,noonespecial,,,"This is not an uncommon perception. I run into way to many fundies who believe the Bible is some sort of magical text straight from the stone tablets of God. (They, of course, pick their favorite translation, or worse, paraphrase, to be this magic book).<p>Its closer to the truth to call the Bible a scrap-book of letters, personal accounts, advice for living, poetry, religious writings, and history spanning many centuries.<p>Those that have believed it have carefully assembled it over the millennia (yeah, some of it is that old!) in order to tell the story of God's relation to man.<p>Emptied of its religious context, (and sadly, modern connotative baggage that is has accumulated in the last few centuries), it is one of the most fascinating artifacts of ancient humans to be found anywhere. Its ubiquity belies the fact that it is well worth study in this regard.",1216878856

I'm a writer primarily: my plan for a start-up is one that relies on writing, and I think that as much as I like designing sites, my skill currently lies far more in writing. Therefore, I can relate this particular paradox with some confidence:<p>If you read them poetry that ISN'T by you, they won't get it. Unless you explain it to them first.<p>If you read them poetry YOU wrote, it ONLY works if it's bad. The minute you write something decent, it doesn't interest them. This is because only in bad writing can you be as bland and generic as you need to be to woo women.<p>As for learning exercise: makes sense. You can also try writing them. Writing haiku makes for a FASCINATING mental exercise. There's so little room to work in, and so much you can do.",1216878800

Sometimes, respected scientists get into the act.<p>I'm impressed, though -- this is a much better article than the title would suggest. It does a good job of running down the evidence that this guy is being hysterical for no good reason. All the old data -- and there's quite a lot of it -- is inconclusive, and there's no new data:<p><i>Herberman is basing his alarm on early unpublished data. He says it takes too long to get answers from science and he believes people should take action now - especially when it comes to children.</i><p>""Early, unpublished data.""

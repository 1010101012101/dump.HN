7879770,comment,7877147,7877452,2,0,dpe82,,,"The architecture is suited just fine, it all depends on how you decide to use Node.js. If you&#x27;re using it for handling lots of asynchronous IO (eg. for a webserver) then it&#x27;s probably unwise to mix in lots of blocking compute-heavy tasks on the main thread. But that&#x27;s not the only way to use Node.js.<p>For example, we have a media library that implements HTML5 canvas2d, WebGL, WebAudio, video/image/sound encode and decode and a bunch of other media related compute-heavy tasks. We&#x27;ve done this as a native module because it lets us control all those APIs using the same code we would use in the browser, but we run that code in Node.js as a separate worker process where we don&#x27;t care about things like IO latency. It works great.<p>Edit: grammar",1402513112

Imagine recording every moment of your day from your smart phone, and not just when you wake up. Why would you do this? Well, may be there for little things like having a meeting with someone and you want to remember details without writing it down. Why take the time to record it manually when you have the ability to do it in HD, for cheap?<p>Again, this is hard to imagine wanting to do especially for privacy reasons, but were things like facebook and twitter easy to imagine in the 80s?

A well run society does not, or shouldn&#x27;t, simply allow companies to pick and choose which laws they will follow.<p>As to the remarks in the article about entrepreneurialism, taxi drivers are mostly pretty entrepreneurial. The medallion system that run in US cities and some others keeps drivers from operating as freely as they might, so drivers usually need to work for a medallion holder, and it is the medallion holders who are reaping economic rents, not the drivers.  And it is precisely these economic rents that Uber hopes to capture; it is not aimed at benefiting the public or the drivers.<p>Contrary to the medallion system, London has no restriction on the number of taxis allowed to operate. In London, many &quot;black cab&quot; drivers are freelance and own their own vehicle, etc. Very entrepreneurial. They get fares by being the only ones allowed to pick passengers up on the street, and so-called &quot;taxi ranks&quot; but can also use the usual phones, etc. They can also use traffic lanes that are normally restricted to buses, which are less congested.  In exchange for these privileges, they have to drive vehicles that are wheelchair accessible, have higher requirements of safety than ordinary passenger vehicles, and must pass more stringent road worthiness tests than required of non-black cabs and private vehicles. They are also restricted in what they can charge, as shown on their meter.<p>The cars using Uber have none of these restrictions and with the advent of the app, being allowed to collect passengers from the street is no longer such an advantage for black cab drivers, depriving them of fares and income, while proving a lower quality service to passengers on average.<p>In the end, I imagine that Uber will have to accede to local regulations, at which point their ability to make money becomes more similar to what exists currently, i.e. not such a big deal after all.",1402511681

7879583,comment,7878294,7879045,1,0,king_jester,,,"> Taxi cabs in most major cities run on a Medallion system, its an artificial limit on the number of cabs that can exist in the city(sometimes done because of lobbying by the existing cab owners, sometimes to reduce the number of cabs in the city). This restriction causes the price of Medallion to be artificially higher than it should be. For instance in NYC, Medallions are now sold for upto $1 million. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/nyregion/1-million-medalli.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/nyregion/1-million-medalli...</a>.<p>The medallion program in NYC was recently expanded with the introduction of green cabs that are official NYC cabs that service outer boroughs. The Bloomberg administration fought a court battle over the medallion expansion and won. Medallion systems are not inherently bad, but they can be used as a way to stifle better service (just like anything).<p>> Why do people pay $1 million to own a cab? Because this is the aggregated value they estimate to be, based on the number of years they will operate the cab for(and the profit they will make from it). This is precisely why most cab owners in the NYC are immigrants who can barely speak English, because only they have the savings to own and operate a cab.<p>Prior to the medallion expansion, most medallions were actually owned by firms and not individual cabbies. The reason why most cabbies are immigrants is not because they are loaded and can buy a million dollars of value outright. Also, most cabbies do speak English to some capacity.<p>> Imagine you having spent $1 million to acquire a cab medallion, would you support any measure to increase the number of cabs in the city? Nope! That&#x27;s precisely why all measures against increasing this number is heavily resisted by the cab owners.<p>This is true, firms worried about value loss of their medallions when more would be issued. However, it is important that cab MEDALLION HOLDERS, not cabbies, were most opposed to the change as they had the most to lose. In NYC, cabbies were also opposed, but mostly because they worried the terms of their medallion access would get worse and leave them poorer.<p>> You&#x27;d think that they would be ok with bringing Uber under the same medallion system but that position would be completely contradictory to their economic interest. They have, in past resisted increase in number of medallions, so that makes no sense for them to even remotely support bringing Uber under the same licensing system.<p>In the case of NYC, Uber would most certainly want to avoid being a part of the medallion system as that would effectively regulate their business and drivers. Uber seeks to avoid regulation while providing private cab service, not to be integrated into regulated cab systems.<p>> This is also the reason why the slave owners of the south resisted abolition of slavery. A slave stops being a &#x27;labor&#x27; input in your profit and loss calculation, and becomes a capital asset. Its value is derived from the total earnings anticipated to be made in the lifetime of the slave. Consider it like this, if you are a programmer who can make $100K a year, and has a working life of 20 years, then a slave owner would be willing to pay you upto $100K*20 = $20M to posses you, of course he wouldn&#x27;t wanna pay $20M, because then he would make no profit, plus there is a risk potential involved, running away or death, so like $10M. Now if a slave owner pays $10M to acquire you then there is no way he would wanna set you free until he at least recuperates that cost.<p>Please don&#x27;t reduce people who were slaves to value objects, this is extremely problematic and dehumanizing.",1402511364

The water itself is analogous to electrical charge, the pressure at the input of the pipe is similar to voltage, and the rate of flow of the water through the pipe is like electrical current. Just as with an electrical resistor, the flow of water through the pipe is faster if the pipe is shorter and/or it has a larger diameter. An analogy for a memristor is an interesting kind of pipe that expands or shrinks when water flows through it.  If water flows through the pipe in one direction, the diameter of the pipe increases, thus enabling the water to flow faster. If water flows through the pipe in the opposite direction, the diameter of the pipe decreases, thus slowing down the flow of water. If the water pressure is turned off, the pipe will retain it most recent diameter until the water is turned back on. Thus, the pipe does not store water like a bucket (or a capacitor) – it remembers how much water flowed through it.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2008/apr-jun/memristor_faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hpl.hp.com/news/2008/apr-jun/memristor_faq.html</a>",1402510112

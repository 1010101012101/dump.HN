Lectures are largely a waste of time for me.<p>I ended up going to a special ADHD clinic and I got diagnosed. Unfortunately, a week and a half after beginning the titration process of Concerta I started getting side-effects (palpitations). Apparently, I also have anxiety, so the doc told me that I could either start again with a slower titration process, or take antidepressants along with the ADHD meds. I decided to drop it and not take any of the meds because the side effects of the antidepressants scared me (not to mention the negative vibe you get from people when they hear that you&#x27;re on psychiatric meds).<p>College is really hard for me. I do very well in some classes (mostly in the applied CS courses), and just average to poor in others. The reason is mainly because even though I love programming, many of the Computer Science courses are theoretical and boring to me, so after about a month into the semester I start spiraling down and barely doing the homework assignments, or seriously going over lecture notes to try to gain a deeper understanding of the material.<p>During the finals, I end up wasting days on doing nothing productive (like right now -- I have a final next week and I&#x27;m sitting here doing nothing) until I conjure up enough willpower to actually open the books and start studying (usually the fear of failure takes over and then I force myself to study... with lots of anxiety). And even then, I still find it hard to fully concentrate on the material.
I find myself trying to read a textbook, and I feel like my mind and body are pulling me away, so I end up just getting up from the chair, and walking back and forth around the house while my mind just entertains some random thoughts.<p>I realize that I&#x27;ve been like this my whole life (my High School years are very similar). When I find something that really interests me, I will do it from the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to sleep. For example, I&#x27;ve done programming projects that forced me to learn new technologies where I had to read over 1,200 pages of documentation, and I would just do it obsessively until I&#x27;m done with the project. After the project is done though, and it&#x27;s time to just maintain it (fix bugs, for example), I usually get very bored with it and dump it.<p>I guess because College assignments aren&#x27;t interesting to me (for some reason, the grade on the final exam isn&#x27;t enough of a motivator for me to study) I have a hard time applying myself to them the way I apply myself to things I&#x27;m really passionate about.",1373619018

Then, we observe a correlation between these two things. For the sake of argument, I&#x27;m going to make this 0.001 (I&#x27;d probably estimate less).<p>Now, once we see this correlation, we now need to calculate two things: 1. The probability of observing that correlation (call that P(C)). Note that the more extraordinary the correlation, the less probable it is, and the smaller this term would be. In this case, the graph matches vaguely, I&#x27;m going to give it a probability of 0.1.<p>2. Given a world where there is a causation, what is the probability we&#x27;d see this correlation (Q: I&#x27;m not 100% on this part). Now, Greek debt could plausibly be driven by other things, which would mask the Facebook effect, so there&#x27;s no guarantee there would be a correlation. This term is called P(C | Fg), and I have no idea what value to give it. Let&#x27;s try 0.5.<p>What we want to know is: P(Fg | C), that is, the probability of a connection given we have observed a correlation.<p>Boom! P(Fg | C) = P(C | Fg) x P(Fg) / P(C)<p>So our posterior probability (after observing this correlation) changes from 0.001 to 0.001 x 0.5 / 0.1 = 0.005",1373618698

Nobody can digest it, but it causes more problems for some than for others, e.g. if you have IBS (which about 1 in 7 people has). Spelt, an ancient variety of wheat, also contains gluten, but has low levels of fructans, and is thus more easily digested.<p>There is a pretty well-researched diet for people with IBS, called the Low FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols) diet.

The vision behind building a MVP is to identify the most valuable prospects (that make you money) and to get that to the market earliest.<p>As soon as the MVP starts generating revenue, any further development requires less out-of-pocket investment because the revenue generated will be substituting the cost. This allows for more breathing room to automate, improve, reduce waste, innovate and grow the product.<p>The biggest secret regarding business is possibly the concept of perceived value. Perceived value is not about &#x27;faking&#x27; value, instead it is about defining it.<p>Example being, instead of charging $ x per hour for web development; break it up into different tasks and charge accordingly: website design, graphic design, copywriting, SEO, marketing (social media, ppc/ppv), system design, consultation (ex. to determine best path forward), training, support, analytics, business analysis etc.<p>Once you have defined the tasks involved, you can be honest with your client in terms of your strengths and every task will be judged according to its merits (what defines success?). Most clients would prefer paying a qualified copywriter the same amount (or less) than he would be paying  a non-qualified web dev.<p>Defining what you do will allow you to reduce waste and distribute work more easily on your team.<p>The real trick behind successful software development/consultation is the focus on building systems instead of services. Systems being defined workflows concerning components and participants, focused on re-use. Because lets be honest, real software design reuse either require building generic systems that allow for all scenarios (or can be extended) or defining interactions and components (ea. a design &#x27;pattern&#x27;).",1373616561

That&#x27;s extremely useful and clever, but i&#x27;d really like python to give me some &quot;ok, you&#x27;re not doing things wrong&quot; message as I&#x27;m typing.<p>Even better, once i enter a relationship declaration, it should give me a list of all the parameter i can use, along with the things thoses properties accept for value. This way i wouldn&#x27;t have to check the documentation every time i&#x27;m writing one.
It could also let me discover new things as i&#x27;m typing (&quot;hey what&#x27;s that property doing ? that looks interesting...&quot;). Autocompletion is another way of discovering APIs.<p>But for that, you need type declarations.<p>EDIT : as for my api, it&#x27;s really nothing fancy. It&#x27;s structured in three big parts &quot;admin / common / public&quot;. They each have their &quot;model / business / service&quot; layers, and each have their modules. Only the service layer is impacted by flask. I have some &quot;utils&quot; modules for very low-level stuffs (json serialization, etc). 
Flask configuration are used a bit everywhere, because i want my api to have only one configuration file.

6031468,comment,6029823,6030759,2,0,goblin89,,,"Indeed. One should refer to the rules when one&#x27;s in doubt. However, this assumes that everyone in company is equally humble, excellent at communication, and proficient at their job. Since most companies are unable to hire that well (maybe it&#x27;s impossible), no one would admit that rules are not mandatory.<p>This leaves an expert in a complex situation: everyone says you have to follow the rules, but you also know that The Right Thing is not in 100% compliance with them.<p>If you&#x27;re humble enough, you choose to follow the rules, becausewellyou naturally assume that people who wrote these rules are more proficient. Then, after a while, you become very disappointed when you see that you didn&#x27;t do The Right Thing only because people who hire and make the rules didn&#x27;t do their job properly.<p>If you choose to break the rules, you wait to get fired. If you don&#x27;t, that may mean simply that nobody has noticed you. Or maybe they have, but chose not to speak to you about ityou can&#x27;t tell, but you feel like you&#x27;re an outlaw. And if you do get fired in the end, you become not so inclined to break the rules from now on (unless you have OP&#x27;s self-confidence).",1373616181

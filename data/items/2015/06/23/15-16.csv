Littering for example. It creates a burden on society to clean up after others.<p>There isn&#x27;t shame in using welfare as a safety net, its there to catch you from following in to absolute destitution from which there is no climbing out of in many cases. There is shame or stigma with staying on it and not finding work, or not retraining to find work. Their is shame in unnecessary long term dependency of an able bodied person being on it. There is shame if everyone just up and decided everything I want is already being paid for, why should I bother. That&#x27;s abuse, by doing so, you take away from others who truly need welfare to survive and aren&#x27;t capable of finding work or disabled, you take money from other areas that need it like healthcare, parental leave, education, etc. That&#x27;s finding a candy jar of free candy and just dumping all the candy in your pocket.<p>There is no welfare system in existence, theoretical or otherwise that could sustain a disproportionally large number of people dependent on it by active choice, where there is more being taken out then being paid into it. There isn&#x27;t a socialist democracy that can function that way.",1435075190

It has  quickly become a great device for our family.<p>Some of our thoughts:<p>* The integration with third party services has put it into a new realm of usefulness.<p>* I am still disappointed I cannot tell it to read me a book from anything but Audible. I would love to say, &quot;Read Hamlet from Guttenberg.&quot;<p>* The connection between Echo and Prime Music is sensational. If you like genres of music over specific artists, it really shines.<p>* If you have kids, the Echo is a blast for them to interact with. Endless questions from your kids is great to hear.<p>* It would be awesome if they opened it up more. I could see it being a game master for family games of trivia or spelling contests.<p>* I&#x27;d say we use the Echo for 3-4 hours a day with a majority of the time used to stream music. &quot;Amazon, play Kidz Bop 28&quot; is a common refrain.<p>* When playing scrabble we use it as a timer.<p>* We&#x27;ve never used it to order anything from Amazon.<p>* We do use it to compile shopping lists. I was surprised how quickly this became an essential part of our household. So easy to say, &quot;Amazon, add olive oil to shopping list.&quot;<p>* You can choose between Alexa and Amazon as they wake word. We use Amazon since it is easier for the kids to register with the Echo.<p>* You cannot change the wake word from those two.<p>* We use the Android app for non voice control and it has gotten much better recently.<p>* The news function could use a ton of work. I don&#x27;t want to hear things I am not interested in from NPR.<p>* It listens to everything. If you happen to mention Amazon in conversation it&#x27;ll pick it up, even if you are 2 rooms away.<p>* At $99 it is a device I&#x27;d recommend to almost any family. At $179 I couldn&#x27;t justify buying one.<p>Anyway, they have a winner for families if the price point was lower. I am very glad we got ours for $99.",1435075042

I just think it&#x27;s impossible for most people to not take it for granted. If you&#x27;re under 30, you inherently take it for granted because you know of nothing else, you simply cannot appreciate the technology as much as someone who lived a good chunk of their lives without it. You can &quot;know&quot; and imagine what life was like before our current internet culture, maybe even empathize, but there are still things that are unknowable and can&#x27;t be experienced by just going off the grid. One such example is culture. The culture of society was different because of the technology (or lack of) at the time. Everything from how you interacted with your friends, to how you received and consumed media, to banking and your place of employment. <i>Everything</i> was different before our current technology.<p>The people who grew up with supercomputers in their pockets don&#x27;t know of a world where 3-way calling was something magical and you&#x27;d get giddy when you used it (or horrified when it was used as a tool to trick you into admitting you liked someone and they were on the phone silently listening). Or a world where if you wanted to find an address or phone number, you had to go find a phone book. Wanted to go on a vacation and look up cool places to see while there? You were heading to the library. If you were on the road driving, and wanted to call someone, you had to stop off and find a payphone (and pay a fortune if you were out of the area). Good luck if you blew a tire. But back then, more people were inclined to stop off and help because of this very problem. Again, society was very different back then.<p>People take for granted the fact that you now have all the world&#x27;s information and entertainment at your fingertips. I know because I take it for granted myself and I <i>know</i> what the world was like before our current technology. I&#x27;m in my late 30s. If I take it for granted from time to time, how can someone who never knew a life without internet & cell phones appreciate what they have?<p>I know this sounds a bit preachy, and I didn&#x27;t really mean for it to come across that way, but I find myself echoing Louis CK sentiment on technology and today&#x27;s youth.

In order for a static type system to not be restrictive (like Java&#x27;s or C++&#x27;s) it has to be flexible i.e. it has allow types of varying degrees of vagueness. If I am an inexperienced programmer with no discipline nothing stops me from picking the vaguest type possible and making a complete mess. Type errors do not prevent all bugs, in-fact they prevent only a minimal subset of bugs, most bugs are related to logic errors involving an ill-thought out algorithm or data errors related to invalid data provided by the user which often can only be caught by dynamic type systems.",1435074884

How many ways are there to write it as a sum of positive integers? Seven: 1+1+1+1+1; 1+1+1+2; 1+1+3; 1+2+2; 1+4; 2+3; 5. How do these numbers behave? How fast do they grow? Does anything about them repeat periodically?<p>Back in 1918, Hardy and Ramanujan found an amazing formula, an asymptotic series that you can use to compute p(n) exactly with a manageable amount of computation. (The series doesn&#x27;t <i>converge</i>, but if you stop adding at the right point you get the right answer!) Rademacher later tweaked it to make it actually convergent.<p>Ramanujan also found some very startling results of the following kind: If n leaves remainder 4 when divided by 5, then p(n) is a multiple of 5. If n leaves remainder 5 when divided by 7, then p(n) is a multiple of 7. If n leaves remainder 6 when divided by 11, then p(n) is a multiple of 11. (Why 4, 5, and 6? Because 24x4 is 1 mod 5, and 24x5 is 1 mod 7, and 24x6 is 1 mod 11. No, this is not meant to be obvious.) Unfortunately, no such thing is true for 13, or in fact for any other prime number. (Ramanujan also found related results for <i>powers of</i> 5, 7, and 11.)<p>But! There are <i>similar</i> things for other primes, and Ono proved that for any prime other than 2 and 3 there are theorems of the form p(ak+b)=0 mod [your prime]. (These differ from Ramanujan&#x27;s in that we don&#x27;t get to take a = the prime in question.)<p>And then in 2011 -- this is the result Elwes is referring to -- Ono and Bruinier generalized this further by finding a sort of fractal structure in the partition function. The idea is that there are relations of the form p(q^m0.a0+b0) and p(q^m1.a1+b1) modulo q, where m1<m0, so that you can compute p(q^m0.a0+b0) mod q in terms of p(much smaller things). The number of much smaller things you need depends on q, and it turns out that (0) for q<=3 this stuff doesn&#x27;t work, (1) for 5<=q<=11 you need <i>no</i> much smaller things so that you get p(...) = 0 mod q, (2) for 13<=q<=31 you need <i>one</i> much smaller thing so that you get p(...) = constant times p(smaller) mod q, etc.<p>This is all sufficiently constructive that Ono can, e.g., exhibit the congruences whose existence he&#x27;s proved, and use them to calculate partition numbers.<p>I don&#x27;t have much understanding of how this all works, but it uses an important bit of machinery called <i>modular forms</i>. (Closely related to the stuff I waved my hands vaguely towards when talking about the Langlands program.) These are mathematical functions with a certain kind of &quot;almost-periodic&quot; behaviour, which turn out to be connected to pretty much everything in number theory. Improvements in understanding these could be very valuable elsewhere.",1435074846

Arguably that&#x27;s a net benefit for people who would otherwise have grown up only speaking a less common language; learning a more common language grants access to a much larger set of speakers, information, and opportunities.  That said, language doesn&#x27;t tend to be <i>lost</i>, just not kept as an exclusive cultural barrier.  Witness the massive efforts to internationalize information, to improve accessibility.  And it&#x27;s still common in many countries to look down upon anyone not speaking the native language, if that can be considered a feature.<p>Ethnicity: What do you have in mind other than language and culture, here?  Because I hope you&#x27;re not suggesting &quot;racial purity&quot; as a property worth preserving.<p>Finally, culture: Only if that culture is unable to propagate itself on its own merits, or in other words, if that culture has merits worth propagating.  Some cultures have incredible history and traditions, and those have typically been preserved and spread further than they ever would have been otherwise.  On the other hand, there are cultures built on oppression, indoctrination, suppression of dissent, lack of opportunity, and other undesirable properties; those cultures don&#x27;t tend to survive exposure to broader information and the outside world (as well as the visibility of those cultures and their traditions <i>to</i> the outside world), which is all the more reason for such exposure.

9765375,comment,9764201,9764201,0,0,netcan,,,"Oil is constantly underestimated. Underestimated hopefully in most cases but underestimated nonetheless.<p>A - Demand for oil is notoriously inelastic. \nIf demand drops a little, a big shift in price will &quot;compensate.&quot; If solar starts genuinely digging into oil&#x27;s market share the  oil prices will drop by a lot, fast until almost the same amount of oil gets bought as before. Whatever you are assuming is the &quot;cheaper than oil&quot; flip point, is very likely to be too optimistic. It is likely to just be cheaper than the most expensive marginal 5%.<p>This is inherently speculative because economics and because real marginal costs of oil production are closely guarded secrets, but over the last 50+ years this has usually been correct. This isn&#x27;t disruptive tech land where the cheaper-worser becomes the cheaper-better and wins total victory. This is substitutable commodity land where prices drop like rocks but total volume produced barely moves.<p>^Much cheaper power for slightly less carbon is still a good thing, but more on the prosperity front than the climate change front.<p>B - There is a lot of oil down there. Even &quot;dry&quot; wells are usually only slightly drier than they were when we started drilling them. We just got the easy oil out and then stopped. FInding oil really means finding &quot;accessible&quot; oil. Our methods of finding and our methods of accessing are technology too. It&#x27;s advancing, like solar tech is.<p>This is what &quot;fraking&quot; is. It&#x27;s a new way of accessing.<p>C - Speaking of fraking… It&#x27;s only just begun, probably. It&#x27;s happening in the states because that&#x27;s where it happens to have been invented. There is no reason to think that it is not equally applicable in Russia, S. America, the Persian Gulf or anywhere else with oil.<p>I like the elegance of solar though, and I hope it succeeds. Decentralization seems like it can take a big part of the residential market. In rich countries, a lot of people can afford it and with between incentives, people&#x27;s general interest and the real estate value (people like investing in their home), it seems like it will have a good run.<p>In poor and/or dysfunctional places, going off grid is always a favored option. Solar power can do what mobile phone did. Anything that relies on less infrastructure is more suitable for these places. This is an especially attractive idea. Mobile phones/modems mean that  phone infrastructure is much easier to come by. Solar + battery could mean the same for electricity. Add in rainwater + home purification systems (progress here too) and all we&#x27;ll need is hover cars to deal with potholes.",1435073987

What&#x27;s the densest way to pack a huge number of oranges into a huge box? Every greengrocer &quot;knows&quot; the answer: hexagonal close packing. (Actually, if you have too many oranges they will get squashed. Better use cannonballs or something.) The first person known to have conjectured explicitly that this is best was Johannes Kepler (better known for his work in astronomy) back in 1611.<p>In 1990, a guy called Hsiang claimed to have proved this. It was (and is) generally reckoned that his proof had holes in it. One of the leading critics of Hsiang&#x27;s proof was Thomas Hales, who in 1998 announced his own proof. It was a very computational proof: Hales reduced the Kepler conjecture to a statement about the minimum value of a function of 150 variables (presumably describing how the spheres are arranged; I don&#x27;t know how this works, but I remark that Gauss proved back in 1831 that the densest arrangement with the spheres on a regular lattice is the usual one, so there&#x27;s probably something clever going on), and then proved that there are &quot;only&quot; 5000 or so genuinely distinct configurations, each of which gives rise to a linear programming problem (i.e., optimization of a linear function subject to linear constraints), and then solved them all with a computer. This is a bit like the famous Appel-Haken proof of the &quot;four colour theorem&quot;, only much worse.<p>The mathematical details were extremely intricate. A lot of very smart mathematicians looked at Hales&#x27;s proof and reported that they were 99% sure it was right but couldn&#x27;t be more confident than that.<p>So Hales started a project &quot;FLysPecK&quot; (= FormaL Proof of Kepler) to verify all the details using automated proof-checking software. (So there&#x27;s a tenuous connection here with the &quot;univalent foundations&quot; work, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any more to it than that both are related to automated proof-checking.) And, after more than a decade of grind, the Flyspeck team has declared success and (assuming <i>they</i> haven&#x27;t messed up) Kepler&#x27;s conjecture has definitely been proved.<p>What next? Well, presumably by applying proof-checking software to a real serious mathematical problem the Flyspeck team has helped to improve it and make it more useful for other real serious mathematical problems.",1435073006

There&#x27;s no solar energy at night and it&#x27;s greatly reduced in cloudy days. Wind power is unpredictable and closely matches the output of hydraulic power, so that the two sources can&#x27;t complement each other. You can check Brazil in recent history to check the effects of droughts in the power grid.\nIn the end there is a need of conventional power plants always ready to backup the grid when the renewable energy is not available.<p>2 - The majority of losses of the power distribution network are on the last mile, when the voltage is lower and the current is higher. If every house and electric car become consumers and providers to the grid, most power movements occur in the low voltage networks. There&#x27;s also the issue of batteries storing energy for later consumption. Lithium batteries have a 80%-90% efficiency storing energy.<p>3 - Since we are talking of the environment, rare earth metals have a very pollutant and energy intensive extraction process which in most cases is not accounted in the environmental cost of solar panels.<p>Replacing the majority of energy production by renewable energies will result in an net efficiency loss. I would rather support a balanced production with nuclear (fusion?) power plants providing the fixed needs of the grid and renewable energies making up the rest.",1435072930

So, suppose you have an infinite supply of tiles of some set of shapes and sizes (trivial simple case: squares of a single size). You might be able to use them to tile the whole plane (e.g., the obvious square tiling, like the pixels of a computer display). The easiest tilings to think about, like this one, are <i>periodic</i>: they repeat themselves. Some others are <i>aperiodic</i>: they don&#x27;t repeat.<p>In the 1960s, a guy called Wang proved a nice theorem: there is a computer program that can answer the question &quot;here are some tiles; can I tile the plane with them?&quot; if, and only if, every set of tiles that can tile the plane can do so periodically. (This isn&#x27;t hugely surprising in retrospect; the idea is that you can recognize when there&#x27;s a tiling if and only if all tilings are effectively finite.) And then Robert Berger found a set of (thousands of) tiles that can tile the plane, but only aperiodically.<p>(I lies slightly: the tilings in the paragraph above are all of a very special kind: the tiles are squares with carefully designed wiggles on their edges that restrict which ones can go next to which others. Equivalently, they&#x27;re squares with coloured sides and abutting sides&#x27; colours have to match.)<p>So then the question arises: Berger did this with 20,000 different kinds of tile, but how few do you need? You have probably heard of &quot;Penrose tilings&quot;: Roger Penrose found a set of <i>two</i> tiles (these ones aren&#x27;t square) that will tile the plane but only aperiodically. So ... can you do it with only <i>one</i>?<p>It turns out you can, and Socolar and Taylor found a tile that does it. You can do this with a hexagon and some restrictions (like the colours on those square tiles earlier) on what can match with what, or you can perturb the hexagon so that the restrictions fall out naturally from the geometry (like putting wiggles in the sides of the squares). Unfortunately, the perturbations required make the Socolar-Taylor tile disconnected -- it&#x27;s made of multiple bits that move around together!<p>I am inclined to doubt that anything will come of this that&#x27;s useful elsewhere in mathematics, but it&#x27;s incredibly cool.",1435072291

Alexa doesn&#x27;t always understand the question and seems to screw up sports scores and schedules pretty frequently. It seems about as good as Siri but not as good as Cortana. I have never used Google Now so I can&#x27;t compare to that.<p>Amazon pushes out frequent updates and integrations with third parties - Audible, Pandora, IFTTT and some home automation systems just to name a few. They definitely seem committed to Alexa.<p>Overall, I like Alexa. I wouldn&#x27;t say it has changed my life or anything and I&#x27;m not sure how much I would miss it if I didn&#x27;t have it, but I&#x27;m glad I do if you know what I mean.

The point is even at low speeds you still have a fairly long stopping distance.  Which is why you can see so many fender benders in stop and go traffic.<p>PS: At high speeds wind resistance can dramatically affect stopping distance, but your breaks have limits on how much heat they can take so it's a fairly convoluted equation.",1261591172

Legend has it that he was a prominent electrical engineer in the early twentieth century. Not long after his retirement, all of the engineers at General Electric had a problem. Although each was wise, they were unable to understand the complexity of the machinery. A call was made and Charlie Steinmetz came to the plant to offer his assistance.</i><p><i>Ol’ Charlie walked around the machine for a few minutes, just looking it over, not touching anything. After a few minutes, Charlie took out a piece of chalk, walked over and placed a large X on one particular part of the machine. When the other engineers disassembled the machine, they were amazed to find that it was exactly where the problem was. A few days later, the engineers received an invoice from Charlie for $10,000! This was a lot of money in those days, so they returned it to Charlie and ask that he itemize it. A few days later, they received an itemized bill which read:</i><p><i>Making one X mark – $1.00</i><p><i>Knowing where to place the X – $9999.00</i><p>Even if one tosses the idea that there are ""rockstar programmers"" who are 10x more productive than merely good ones, someone with the right experience and domain knowledge can be priceless.  I have certainly found cases in which I could <i>merely hear the symptoms</i> of a very subtle bug and find it in 2 minutes, whereas a great programmer unfamiliar with the codebase, field, and my past experience might have taken a week to find it.",1261590762

Interfaces are like contracts, so you want to make sure everything (including how corner-cases are handled) are explicitly described.  With well-designed and fully-documented interfaces, the implementation code can usually be quickly understood even if it lacks comments and is written in a more ""advanced"" style.",1261588559

The arguments in favor of this are that it's easy, and it scales linearly with velocity, so that you'll be further behind when moving faster, and have more time to react.<p>At first blush, this article seems to contradict that: since stopping time is O(n^2), we should need a quadratic stopping distance formula. However, upon further consideration, it seems to me that the 2-second rule ought to be just fine. That allows for reaction time (assumed to be 1.5sec in the article), and the quadratic part is taken care of by the fact that the other car can't just stop dead in front of us, but has to take the same quadratic stopping time that we do.",1261587629

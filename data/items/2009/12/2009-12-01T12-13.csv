969629,comment,969526,969608,0,0,dejb,,,"Is that sarcasm or what? During the George W Bush's tenure as president, the US government (backed by the massive oil  companies) WAS that organisation. Why did they not prevail? Cause the science doesn't work. This is likely to be the very reason why some climate change scientists have such a hard nosed attitude<p>Even if you don't believe that is what happened then you must admit that the existing energy companies have a huge incentive to stop this and easily have the funds to compete with the current spending. Please explain why they haven't managed to do this successfully.<p>The most likely answer is that the science doesn't work and the scientific community has eventually rejected their money. So the energy companies have moved on to funding sceptic groups instead.",1259672088

969613,comment,969595,969595,0,0,fp,,,"I think Clojure is not a simple language. The reason is, that you have to learn about 1) Lisp, 2) Clojure's approach to concurrency (immutable data structures + reference types) and 3) the JVM. These are all fairly complex systems on their own. The combination of them is what makes Clojure interesting, and, in my opinion, you can't leave one out and still have a great language.<p>Depending on your knowledge, this may make it a bad choice as a first language because it's so much to learn at once. You could be better off, to start by learning something more similar to what you already know (possibly Python/Django or Ruby/Rails for web programming).<p>That said, Clojure is learnable, of course. It may just take more time. If it feels right to you, then go for it. Enthusiasm about the tools will help your learning. And either way, it's not like you are making a mistake.",1259670733

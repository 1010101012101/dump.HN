Deliver the agreed upon and hold them to their [financial] responsibilities. Never, ever work without a signed contract or billing authorization.<p>It's been my experience that clients come in many shapes and forms, levels of availability and interest along with disparate motivations to pay or not pay their bills. There's no one answer to client as they range from laid back and easy to completely schizo, but my practice has been to over-deliver in both the product and the project administration side. It doesn't always work out they way one would hope, but small improvements over time can lead to less project-related headaches in the future.<p>Scope is probably the most important part of freelancing. What am I building, how long do I have to build it and what are the assumed costs involved? Each of those items needs to be hashed out prior to the start of the project and the quicker you do that, the earlier the work starts.<p>Contract. Never start work without a contract. Not even with family. Without a legally binding, signed agreement, you surrender most of your rights, and work, to the client. Aside form the scoping of the project, which is usually unpaid, not a lick of work starts.<p>Milestones. Establish achievable milestones with the client prior to starting the work. If it's 80 hours of work, milestone what you can achieve at 30 and 60 hours and make sure the client is happy with the work being done and if not use the contract and scope to keep the work on track. Generally speaking, clients have no imagination and will only remember details or think of new shit once someone else has started the work. Much like a product manager. Treat them as such: yes you want that, but it's out of scope for this release; write a story and put it in the backlog.<p>Documentation. You need to document everything. Every email, phone call, tweet, design or requirement that the client sends you. Summarize all conversations you have with the client over the phone or in person, write them up in an email and ask the client to confirm your assumptions. It takes five minutes here and there, it's billable time and it keeps everyone honest.<p>Communication. Don't disappear off the radar and surface weeks later with a working prototype. Chances are requirements or timelines have changed and clients don't like to be ignored. Send daily updates until they tell you to stop, then send two during the week and one on Friday summarizing tasks accomplished. Ask for their input and approval as you need constant buy-in. Clients get excited in the early stages of a project but then get bored/confused and may decide they no longer need or want the work, becoming reluctant to participate or pay. Keep selling them the project every day.<p>Bill them on time. If you're on time with your code, then you should be on time with your billing and be firm about it. I use Freshbooks (<a href=""http://www.freshbooks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freshbooks.com/</a>) to keep the clients up to date with all of my tasks and hours and I know if they've looked at the current invoice or not. If they've already paid for most of the project and don't look at the final invoice, I don't worry too much. If they're in arrears and aren't looking at the invoice, chances are they have a pile of unopened bills on their desk. Negotiate this part diplomatically, but don't deliver anything until payment milestones have been achieved from the client.<p>Always be delivering. If the client has no/weak technical background, get ahead of them by under-promising and over-delivering. A client that can get ahead of you will [reluctantly] become your boss. A client who is always one or two steps behind you but awed by your production will want to be partner and that makes for a better client experience and future work.<p>Be human. Ignoring the agenda that they client may have in relation to the project, keep in mind that the client is human and will have fears, anxieties or misplaced excitement or expectations related to the outcome. In some cases, a client could be asking you to build them something that they think will eliminate their position. That's very scary to a lot of people. You'll need to get into their mindset to visualize what a success for them will look like and then strive towards that, reassuring them that together you're going to succeed. That's collaboration over contract negotiation.<p>On a small project you won't need to dedicate much time to these activities as long as you're able to consistently communicate a good attitude. On longer projects you might as well pretend you're a partner and lifelong friend as the client will often look for you for support. And then tere are some clients who are just jerks, but knowing that you're only going to be giving them 80 hours of your time will help assuage your heartburn.<p>I hope this rant helps you or anyone else reading it.",1318690767

Theoretically, yes, those things could be separate. But only if in said theory you abstract away human nature, group dynamics and such. For example, if something is developed as FOSS the people involved tend to make it customizable to the extreme.<p>>I can only assume that you own a car you have modified with aftermarket parts all to hell and ""fuck[ed] every aspect of"" because it was possible and really wish someone had made it tinker proof to save you from yourself.<p>When you assume, you make an ass out of you and me.<p>> Otherwise you sound like some arrogant technically literate person who feels that he or she knows what less technically competent people should be allowed to do with their own possessions because it's for their own good.<p>Yeah, the kind of arrogant technically literate person who has seen how less technically competent people use their products and what they ask of them.

When, if ever, the social-gaming population will wake up one day and think, perhaps aloud, and perhaps at great volume, ""What the <i>fuck</i> am I doing with my life? <i>Why</i> do I need more virtual corn patches?"" And, perhaps, ""You know what? I'm not accepting the Facebook invitation into little Mikey's mafia family. Fuck that noise. I'm out.""<p>By this, what I really mean is: when someone finally gets sick of Farmville, is he going to move on to the next Farmville, or is he burned out on the genre for good? Seems like there should be a ""fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me"" dynamic at work with players of these games. Which would mean that the genre is destined for oversaturation and burnout, and that there will be diminishing returns awaiting any marginal entrants into the field.<p>I'm sure the genre, as a whole, is still growing by leaps and bounds. But do we have any leading indicators about the playerbase? Such as their likelihood to be investing in more than one time-sinkey social game at a time? Or their likelihood to pick up another after quitting the first?<p>I'm not wishing for the demise of the genre, but rather, am hoping that it'll hit a plateau from which it will be forced to innovate, experiment, and evolve. Seems to me that the cold, reductionist design philosophy of addiction-by-the-numbers should eventually dig its own grave in the form of mass player burnout on games produced as such. Then again, that's never happened with casinos. So this may be woefully naive thinking on my part.",1318688078

Seems it's about more than selling hats in TF2, e.g they also need to understand what happens if it becomes possible for users to trade games with each other on Steam.<p>Valve is now a platform provider, more than an actual game company, so they need to understand these things.<p><i>""We need to hire an economist, because we keep bumping up into these issues. You're starting to look at weird issues like currency and inflation and productivity and asset values and liquidity of asset categories. We just wish we were smarter about this stuff. We're reading frantically. We're brushing up, and all we're doing is convincing ourselves that we're more stupid. Half the time people are saying, oh, well, illiquid assets inherently have a penalty, so this argues for trade-ability, that we're essentially becoming a Russian currency model in the 1970s. Everybody races off to try to read papers on the implications of that.""</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-25-valves-gabe-newell-interview?page=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-25-valves-gabe-new...</a>",1318688011

I know I'm never going to be a filmmaker, but I really get sucked into that sort of thing.<p>The super mega edition of Blade Runner (with the three or four different cuts) also has a very, very expansive set of documentaries, which cover not only the making of the film (hiring writers, chasing down financing, creating the effects, etc.) but the arduous task of making the re-release. The range of people involved that they talk to goes from the riggers and everyday film crew to the financiers who seemingly didn't much care what it was about so long as it made money.",1318687880

What methods / sites / tools do other contractors use, here on HN?<p>TL;DR: How do you keep clients informed about what the final bill will be, or do you just surprise them with an invoice?",1318687735

I had the same thought as you but in the end, I was really coding less and less at home. What I did was help in the forums for my favorite language. Helped old timers and newbie alike with examples and good practices. This slowly reignited my passion for the language and I slowly started coming back as I coded libraries people wanted and little examples.

Do you know where you want these side projects to end?  Do you have a list of steps to reach that goal?  And is it broken into small enough tasks that you can check something off the list each night you spend an hour or two?<p>I know that I accomplish very little without this type of ""project clarity"" and often end up poking around at this and that without actually finishing anything.  And just to be clear, I'm not talking about 30 pages of tasks in MS Project ... Just a list that you can see diminish over time.<p>I'm also far better off if I get up early and do my personal projects first, do my paid work and save the reading for the evening ... You may not have the mental energy left to code in the evening so save the less intense work for then.<p>So ... What are you building?  Can you make me excited with a short elevator pitch?  If not, maybe you're not excited enough about it either?<p>These are my issues ... Maybe some will resonate with you.",1318687258

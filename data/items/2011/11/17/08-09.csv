I'm looking for you!",,"Hey guys, so i've been working on an app for the past couple of weeks here and there, but it's time to kick into full start up mode! ..but I need help. I'm looking for a technical co-founder who can help out with mobile app development(ios, android). Quick pitch for the app, sports betting the way it was meant to be... fun, easy, and social! It's time to translate the feeling and experience of watching games with your friends, cheering your favorite team on, trashtalking, and betting with your friends into the bland sports betting systems in play today. A little about me, I'm a design and marketing student at the moment, and am currently running an online clothing store (focusing on jeans) so if anyone needs some expensive jeans im your guy! I hustle, hard, and will do whatever it takes to get things done, and I'm looking for someone with the same type of attitude. As I'm not technical (though im trying to learn) I need someone to be comfortable and in charge of development, focused on mobile, but with that said I'm looking for a partner and not someone who can just code really well. I think there is a huge opportunity for us to put a twist on the boring, stagnant sports betting system currently used. If this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of then please feel free to email me at jordan3caron@gmail.com<p>feel free to ask me anything else, look forward to hearing your guys' input!<p>thanks",1321519882

Legit goods cost only money, but pirate goods instead cost time or uneasiness of breaking the law. Consumers then make cost-benefit analyses as to which version they want, and as long as enough consumers choose the pirated version, the pirate market is sustained.<p>The way to beat a pirate market is to simply treat it as a legit competitor and out-market it. iTunes music store is so incredibly successful, because it is out-marketing illegaly downloaded music. Netflix is so incredibly successful, because it is out-marketing illegaly downloaded movies. They simply provide cheaper and better service than the previous legal alternatives.",1321519843

And I don't speak of the overblown disease fears, but the far more serious effects of emotional desensitization. Sex elicits a chemical response much like cocaine or heroin, and is also prone to the build up of tolerance. Thus, casual sex with multiple partners leads to a severely diminished capacity for pair bonding and emotional fulfilment. It is no coincidence that the state of marriage in western nations is in shambles, while citizens report high levels of unhappiness as demonstrated by massively increasing antidepressant consumption [0].<p>Promoting a rapid change from tradition should be done so cautiously, for Occam's Razor suggests that the majority of the world's civilizations evolved strict marital practices (celibacy till marriage and fidelity thereafter) for good reason [1].<p>0. <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db76.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db76.htm</a><p>1. <a href=""http://darktriumvirate.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/the-cancer-of-western-civilization/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://darktriumvirate.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/the-cancer-o...</a>",1321519420

This is the classic reason why people go with a stateless app layer, so that it's simple to scale at least a single tier of the architecture.<p>I'm still not sure how this lives up to the ""scalable realtime architecture"" that dominates the title. People have been building Redis-backed message brokers for a while now.

You deter the majority of people from speeding in a particular area. You automate an amnesty into the system for certain types of vehicles (emergency services, military, diplomatic) but instead put a protection on publicly owned computers, libraries, schools and charities (which, IMO, should not have to pay for copyrighted works anyway and it is already too much effort to enforce). Create an independent arbiter to handle false-positives and exceptional circumstances without any direct connection to financial interests (a government, funded by the fines or industry funded). Send the remaining money to the copyright holder.<p>There is the same incentive now for blocking MediaSentry and the like, why would the change escalate this? Griefers already do this too but usually with material far more illegal than music.<p>The present system doesn't make sense.

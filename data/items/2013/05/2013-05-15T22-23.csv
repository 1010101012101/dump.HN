5715657,comment,5712098,5713812,1,0,handsomeransoms,,,"Good point. At some point, you'll need to communicate the onion address over a trusted channel. If you trust SSL, then you can serve the landing page over HTTPS, or as others have suggested, you could print the address in the New Yorker itself. I have also heard of using Namecoin or other proof of work schemes, although that would be outside the reach of the average user.<p>If neither of these avenues satisfy, a simple idea for defense-in-depth I've thought of is using .onion vanity name generators (see <a href=""https://github.com/katmagic/Shallot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/katmagic/Shallot</a>) as a very simple proof of work scheme. For example, silk road's .onion starts with silkroad. Finding such an .onion address for a given private key requires brute force computation - according to the Shallot github, about 25 days. Therefore, generating an .onion with a recognizable string at the beginning makes generating a suitable address for spoofing that much harder. Of course, this is hardly a solution - big scary Tor-style adversaries certainly have more computing power than you - but it is something to consider.",1368658713

I recognize that finding your ideal customers and their pain points first is generally the best approach, but if you have domain knowledge or insights, and have an idea for a product that you know you'd use yourself and that you're passionate about, that's just as valid as going off solving someone else's problem. Obviously there needs to be a market for it and people that'd pay for it besides yourself, but it's a good start.<p>It might still be safer to find a problem you're disconnected from emotionally and that has a higher chance of success (and really don't care about much).

No. They are considered brokers. Brokers and commodities exchanges are regulated separately by FINRA and the CFTC/NFA and therefore are not considered MSBs.

Think of it as a graph with a vertex for each task and an directed edge between two tasks if one task depends on the other tasks result. Two tasks are concurrent if there is no dependency between them. Concurrent task can be executed in parallel, but do not have to. Two non-concurrent tasks can not be executed in parallel,<p>Parallelism occurs during runtime when independent task are actually executed at the same time (no matter if you do this on two cores or if you are just interleaving the execution of both tasks on one core). Executing two tasks in parallel requires that these two tasks are concurrent.<p>Example<p>Two (read-only) web requests are concurrent because there are no dependencies between them. Each web request consists of some subtasks like parsing the request, querying the database, performing some business logic and building and sending the response. These subtasks are not concurrent because each one depends on the result of the one before.<p>There are now (at least) two options for processing these both web requests - one after the other or both in parallel. In the first case you ignore the concurrency between both web request, in the second case you exploit the concurrency between both web request by parallelizing their execution.<p>So IMHO there is no choice between concurrency and parallelism. Concurrency is a property of the system you are building (and there is not much you can do in order to add or remove concurrency). You then have a choice to introduce parallelism to exploit concurrency or you just ignore cocurreny, but that's it.",1368656226

  var helloMsg = ""Hello "" + userName;
  messageLabel.setText(helloMsg); 
</code></pre>
The first line will directly get the text value of a UITextField (no callback used here), and it will end up calling directly the 'text' property on the UITextField. So the JS bridge works transparently where JS code call native ObjC code directly (without using callback) and obviously ObjC can directly access the JS side... there are a few gotcha but the full system works beautifully and surprising enough performance are quite good. It took me a few years to come up with the cleanest solution and implementation.<p>I am currently working on integrating such piece of code into some of my apps and have them released on the AppStore. In fact if anyone good in JS is interested I would really appreciate some help to get that bridge off the ground since I truly believe there is a lot of great opportunities with a JS bridge to ObjC that respect all iOS rules.

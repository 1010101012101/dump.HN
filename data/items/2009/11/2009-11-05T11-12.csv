As an engineer I can do what a computer scientist does but a computer scientist can not perform all engineering functions (specifically the case of work requiring professional registration).<p>With that said, what do you like to do?  Find a way to make that your major.  If you like programming, then major in programming.  If you like hardware and software then computer engineering.  If you like hardware then electrical engineering.  If you like rocks then study Geology.  The key thing is to learn to learn, to do research and solve problems.<p>I chose EE as it provided the most long-term flexibility.  Although I'm working in a 'static' area of EE (power engineering), I use a lot of computer programming knowledge in solving problems that I run into.<p>Other than working for yourself, there is no guarantee that you will ever have a job or that your abilities will land you a job (Jack Gansle has a good column on this).  As such you are much better off focusing on learning as much as you can that will help you to continue learning which should give you more options as time passes.",1257422296

Just wondering what people who did it are using? I have heard of Helma and AppJet, but that is about it. Oh, and node.js, of course, but I think it is not a complete framework. Also CouchDB, but I don't fully understand how they intend to host applications in the client, with verifications and all.

I don't think that's true: Consider the<p>CREATE INDEX<p>statement - it's part of the API and it is intended for improving performance. True, a RDBMS will execute a query even if the programmer didn't issue CREATE INDEX before - but this more reflects the rigid separation ('data independence') of the logical and physical data model than a lack of control (API exposure) over performance details.",1257420724

923664,comment,923597,923597,0,0,quant18,,,"Basically Victor Mair's papers always come down to ""I don't like Chinese characters"", and ""I don't like calques"". I'm not so fond of characters either, but I also think calques are a damn sight better than loanwords --- and as Mair notes, a character-based writing system has the side-effect of forcing you to make calques, rather than just stealing foreign words wholesale without understanding them.<p>Among Аnglophones, the French have given calques a bad name. We hear the story all the time in the media: some French people start using an English word to talk about a new concept from the US/UK. Years later, a Language Academy bureaucrat belatedly notices. He wrinkles his nose. He comes up with a cumbersome, incorrect translation of the English word for that concept. Then, for his <i>pièce de résistance</i>, he forces everyone in France to use his new translation.<p>But in Chinese, the process of coming up with calques is decentralised, immediate, and competitive. The first guy to publish a Chinese academic paper or newspaper article on a foreign concept puts together some Chinese word roots and comes up with a calque. The next guy to cite him might accept his translation, or abbreviate it, or reject it entirely. And so on. After a period of confusion, the best word wins. And the Chinese language has a new word whose meaning can reasonably be guessed at, even by someone who's never seen it before.",1257420391

So because he is a living legend one should not say nothing before reading all the papers cited even if from the article his point is already clear and one may say something meaningful even as a modest developer?<p>I'm going to say one for instance: the article's main point is about the fact that because of a threaded and disk-based architecture you can't get much faster than well engineered SQL architectures. For instance Redis is completely excluded from this reasoning, being in-memory and single-threaded.<p>Another point: where are the numbers? For instance I can trivially give proof that Redis can handle 150,000 operations/second per core in a decent Linux Box. I want to know what's the performance of the SQL solutions cited in the article.<p>Another one: all the SQL solutions cited in the article are names I never heard before of today.

923656,comment,923335,923640,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Not reproducing the full comment does not constitute a misquote.<p>Using Clojure doesn't enable you to magically write perfect code. You posted well written Clojure and poorly written C#. You can write poor code in any language.<p>If you wished to remain on the topic of imperative vs functional, you should have avoided phrases like ""using C# as the tool has added a huge degree of ceremony"". You made a direct attack on the language, not on the coding style. You also make significant mention of the number of lines of code, but it seems as though you have intentionally included boilerplate to make your point. Being misleading and deleting comments are not ways to make an effective case for your cause.<p>EDIT: Oh, and on the actual subject of functional style. I still much prefer the C# approach as it reads in order you perscribed:<p>1) calculate liquid value of each item<p>2) filter candidates<p>3) accumulate value<p><pre><code>  (from asset in assets
   let liquidValue = GetLiquidValue(asset) // 1
   where DoubleMargin(asset, liquidValue)  // 2
   select liquidValue).Sum()               // 3
</code></pre>
Compared to the Clojure which reads:<p><pre><code>  (reduce (sum-field :productioncost) 0       ; 3
     (filter doubleMargin?                    ; 2
           (map attach-liquid-value assets))) ; 1
</code></pre>
or the Python which reads:<p><pre><code>  sum(liquid_value                           # 3
      for liquid_value, asset in assets
      (get_liquid_value(asset), asset        # 1
       for asset in assets)
      if double_margin(asset, liquid_value)) # 2</code></pre>",1257419436

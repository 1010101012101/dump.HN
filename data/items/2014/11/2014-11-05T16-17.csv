Technological advancements <i>should</i> make it possible for people to work 15-20 hours a week. In theory. The problem is that those same technological advancements go hand in hand with increased concentrations of wealth. It is the regrettable observed tendency of people with considerably more wealth than the masses to be stingy with that wealth, feel they inherently deserve it and lack empathy.<p>So, if people in general are to benefit from technological advancements, there needs to be legislated wealth redistribution to overcome the inherent miserly-ness of the 1% whose wealth is largely a function of that technology.",1415206795

In all likelihood her problems are at least heavily influenced by her race and gender, even if those factors are neither the base nor the entirety of it.<p>Non-white, non-men start out from a severely disadvantaged position in our society in general and in the industry in particular. I presume this simply serves as a magnifier when it comes to the problem others (namely white men) would experience in the same situations. Plus the gender/race card is obvious for both sides (i.e. she is more likely to blame negative experiences with other people on it, but they may also be more likely to explain her behaviour with it). Consider her reservations about acting in a way that might affirm stereotypes, for example.<p>The entire situation is so messy and taboo-laden from the get-go that it&#x27;s difficult to assess what&#x27;s really going on here and what the chain of events was for each individual situation, but it&#x27;s empirically obvious that there is a very real problem and race/gender is a major factor.<p>EDIT: Also remember that &quot;race&quot; can be a misleading term. It&#x27;s often about culture and cultural biases about other cultures -- ethnicity just tends to be a handy shibboleth. As an anecdotal example: in Germany (and likely other parts of the EU too) you are often at a serious career disadvantage if you have a Polish or Eastern European accent, even if you are very good at what you do, especially if you also happen to be female (though the exact stereotypes you face might again depend on your age).

By virtue of being taught to place authority and trust in the parent, the child generally wants to do what the parent says is &quot;right&quot;. Some children, by virtue of their nature or peer pressure in their surroundings or whatever in addition to parental disapproval, begin to feel that negativity toward their interests reinforced. Had my exceedingly conservative grandparents and parents actually been able to &quot;okay&quot; my early interest in engineering and the sciences at the very least instead of telling me it was unfeminine (as well as my brother&#x27;s early interests in fashion and mathematics, which were strongly labelled both at home and among our peers as faggy and uncool) I think both of us would have had less anguish and self-doubt and emotional issues as teens and in our early twenties.<p>If children are stubborn enough, they can overcome this kind of negative reinforcement at home of the societal norms they see expressed at school and throughout much of whatever culture they belong to. However, as is the case with other people I grew up with who had similar backgrounds, without stubbornness and the willingness to recognize where one would be most happy and useful it is possible to drift for a long time without understanding why everything about one&#x27;s identity is orthogonal to how it feels it should be, or even to just end up in a mediocre paper shuffling job forever.<p>Imo it isn&#x27;t about encouragement or positive reinforcement, but rather (as a parent) helping your children to figure out what <i>they</i> want to do and what they are interested in without projecting your own hopes and aspirations on them. Regardless of if your kid wants to live in a garage in Monterey and make sculptures of feet (or, hell, move to India and build water treatment plants, or study blue whales, or whatever), even if you think they&#x27;d make an amazing neurosurgeon/NFL player/xyz, don&#x27;t push them to be something they&#x27;re not. They get enough backlash from their peers and the rest of the world as it is.<p>Too many kids don&#x27;t just quit STEM (or never start) because they&#x27;re pushed out of it or excluded for one reason or another, too many kids go into what seems socially acceptable because they aren&#x27;t allowed space to grow into whatever the hell they are.",1415205617

The current implementation is to allocate several megabytes of stack for each thread, since memory accounting isn&#x27;t strict this doesn&#x27;t create problems because unused stack doesn&#x27;t really take up space.
If you start accounting memory you will also have to be stricter with allocating stacks for new threads, limiting yourself to just a page or two wherever possible. This is not an easy task.",1415205418

Likely cognitive overload, because the code was too complex to keep entirely in memory. I.e. author was to busy processing the code in his head to notice the typo he just made. Therefore code with lower cognitive load is likely to have fewer bugs like this or even overall. 
Some programmers have learned that there is a way to prevent string typos with appropriate test cases and some programmers keep their code as simple as possible, i.e. with lowest cognitive load. So, we should see correlations to which languages such programmers prefer and which languages encourage such coding practices.<p>This is a complex subject that has much more to do with psychology, than with technology.

8562556,comment,8557958,8561143,0,0,bkirwi,,,"Sure!<p>Let&#x27;s take the immediately preceding example, where the author had a black woman as a supervisor. The author describes this as &#x27;diversity lightning&#x27;. If you interpret this narrowly, this makes absolutely no sense: there&#x27;s no way in which a single person can be considered diverse. On the other hand, if you think about it at an environmental or company level, things look different.<p>Suppose we take a random US tech company&#x27;s employees and dump them in a vase. (Let&#x27;s ignore the ethical issues with this for a moment.) At this point, we&#x27;d expect the odds of a random draw to reflect the tech industry&#x27;s demographics, which is to say, predominantly white and asian males. If you draw this &#x27;predominantly black&#x27; development team from the vase, though, you need to update your priors. You probably <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> calculate your posterior as &#x27;everyone at this company is black&#x27; -- but you&#x27;d still probably guess that you&#x27;re looking at a tech company where there are more black people and women than average. Which is to say, you&#x27;d expect that the company as a whole was more diverse.<p>I think this second reading is a lot more charitable to the author. I also think it&#x27;s the more <i>interesting</i> reading; the demographic representation in a small group is subject to a huge amount of randomness, but the demographics of a entire organization are more telling, and can reveal more interesting things about policy and bias. As a community, software people are normally biased toward systems-level thinking; it&#x27;s weird to me that in this particular issue people have this laser-focus on small groups and tokenism.",1415204812

In most cases, at least the way I see it, automation intends to do away with menial (human) work.<p>If I had to describe the true social value of technology, I&#x27;d say it resides in its ability to let us concentrate on more interesting problems, put our efforts somewhere else, for the greater benefit.<p>But there seems to be a ruling set of values in our society dictating that we have to have one job, between such and such hours, and that the more you do so, the more you can have a &quot;career&quot;. This is a gross simplification, but I honestly think it isn&#x27;t that far from the truth. We&#x27;ve intertwined time and value so poorly that we think time itself has value, whatever we do with it (looking at you crippling bureaucracy).<p>In an (my) ideal society, people who don&#x27;t need to produce more work at any given time would add value to other areas of society by achieving different tasks for different people or learning something new.<p>I&#x27;d like to see more architects, electricians, plumbers, car makers etc. go into schools and show kids what they do, show University students what their purely academic professors can&#x27;t. I&#x27;d like to see more theoretical mathematicians learn about the wonders of growing vegetables. I&#x27;d like to see people who generate and get actual value from others, rather than constantly proxy it through money, idle time and displays of self-importance.<p>I find our society tends to formalize everything, and that of course includes jobs, even when it&#x27;s not necessary. The intent seems to be able to measure everything from productivity to worth, even though both these things are themselves penalized by the activity of measuring/observing them. I&#x27;m a fierce advocate of science and technology, but that certainly doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re compelled to measure everything in controlled conditions.",1415204783

Most teams don&#x27;t have an inherently inclusive culture. Maintaining your differences when you join an otherwise homogeneous group is <i>hard</i> and most of us (probably women even more so than men, because culture and testosterone) were raised in a way that makes us think trying to give up our identity in order to fit in is the right thing to do because it reduces the potential for conflicts.<p>Ideally teams should be inclusive.

Like the OP I consider myself able to do a lot more work in a lot less time than others. Companies I work at tend to take advantage of this. So last year I decided to look for a new job. It didn&#x27;t take long before I found something and gave my resignation letter to my employer. They immediately setup a mtg with myself and the bigwigs and essentially asked me for what it would take for me to stay. Knowing the rule that you never take a counter-offer, I made the numbers extremely high. Huge raise, huge bonuses for multiple years guaranteed. To my surprise, they gave me everything I asked for.<p>Then I notified the company I was planning to leave for that I was planning to stay where I was working. They asked me what the offer was and I told them. Within a day they offered me even more! What an embarrassment of riches this seemed to be. So I went back to my employer at the time and said I was actually leaving. This made them really mad. But Left and went to the new job.<p>It turned out that the new job was completely different from what I was sold. I was leading a team of well over 30 devs (all but 2 were consultants from large consulting firms) across multiple countries around the globe with the intent of performing 24 hour development. We had meetings every 8 hours to do handoffs between the timezones. My first day was over 14 hours of work in the office. The first weekend was completely consumed by a horrible deployment. The team members were absolutely exhausted, sleeping at their desks. This was an absolute nightmare. I was essentially brought in to get rid of the consultants (to save money) and replace them with in-house staff. I was initially brought in as a lead architect/dev. So I went to my boss, who hadn&#x27;t talked to me my entire first week and never even introduced me to the team, and asked him what the timeframe was for me taking over this team and he said &quot;within a month we&#x27;ll be letting go most of the consultants&quot;. I was absolutely shocked and immediately begin trying to find a new job and it took a few months of true hell to do that.<p>There is a lot more to this story, you can email me if you want to hear it. But my points would be, if you&#x27;re talented, people will take advantage of you. And you could end up in a situation where a company will take advantage of you up to your limit. The consultants I worked with were from large well-known consulting firm and I&#x27;m sure they were paid well but their lives were hell and they had no recourse. Almost all of them smoked chronically to deal with their stress, amongst other things. If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll find that you certainly can be more productive but you&#x27;ll end up with two choices. One, work at a normal job where most of your time is free for you to be productive at things you want to do. Or two, be your own boss and choose your own workload.",1415204313

8562496,comment,8561080,8561560,0,0,nilkn,,,"It&#x27;s most definitely possible to put in 40 hours of work. This mainly happens in more labor-intensive jobs. Note that it doesn&#x27;t have to be construction work. Even your primary care physician&#x27;s job might be described as &quot;labor-intensive,&quot; just because they have so many patients to meet with and so much administrative work to do for each one. I&#x27;m sure many (most?) doctors do put in a legitimate 40 hours of work a week.<p>As another example, when I was a college student there were definitely a lot of weeks when I put in a legitimate 40 hours of work. But it was distributed over many activities, from actually sitting in lecture, to attending office hours, taking tests, studying/reading, working on homework, and participating in extracurriculars. There was a ton of downtime mixed in, and there certainly were virtually no solid eight hour blocks of nothing but work.<p>I honestly think a major impediment to office workers like programmers getting in a full 40 hours of productive work is just the environment itself. Just remaining stationary in an office for 8-9 hours a day is intrinsically exhausting, not physically but mentally. The worst part is when you have downtime, but still must remain stationary at your desk in the office. It now feels like you&#x27;re working, but you&#x27;re not. Your energy is draining, but you&#x27;re not actually doing anything productive with that spent energy.<p>(To be fair, I also frequently would do homework up to or beyond midnight, or even on the weekends, whereas today I very rarely do work for my employer after I go home, unless an emergency comes up or I just honestly am so interested in a project that I want to. The upside to the 9-5 workday is that it has a well-defined beginning and end. In college, there was never a feeling of being <i>done</i>, except maybe after your final final for that semester.)",1415204309

It&#x27;s not an isolated example.<p>&quot;But some recovered memories have been bullshit!&quot;<p>Of course they have, but using that fact to label <i>all</i> instances of recovered memory the same is fallacious. It&#x27;s actually a common propaganda technique known as &quot;bad jacketing,&quot; and exploits the tendency of the human mind to overzealously categorize. First you create a category, like &quot;recovered memory.&quot; Then you spend a lot of time highlighting instances where recovered memories have been shown to be false, and link it to an obvious outbreak of hysteria like the Satanic panic. Finally, you lead people to the conclusion that <i>all</i> recovered memories are false.<p>&quot;Some A are B, therefore all A are B.&quot; It doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>You see a similar dishonest tactic with &quot;conspiracy theory,&quot; where the term is used by some to discredit essentially all investigative journalism.

It had to do with the Catholic Church and numerous other religious institutions. Since then quite a bit of this has come out, and the statistics are pretty horrifying. Might not the emotions dredged up with such memories lead to wild flights of fancy on occasion? Keep in mind that much of this abuse happened to deeply religious children in a church setting.

I might rephrase this &quot;Too many kids quit science because they&#x27;re wise as well as smart&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve been on this hobby horse for a while here on HN, and I&#x27;m worried people are getting tired of me.  But seriously, think about it.  I don&#x27;t have attrition rate numbers for typical undergraduate STEM degrees, but I do know that undergrads don&#x27;t drop out of Economics or Poly Sci or Literature to major in CS, Engineering, Physics, and so forth.  Where I do have data, look at attrition rates for graduate schools, especially at the elite level.  A typical attrition rate for an elite Law or Medical school is below 1%.  A typical attrition rate for an elite Engineering or Science PhD program is 35-50%!  MS programs aren&#x27;t s studied, but nation wide, attrition rates are about 33% (I&#x27;d have to dig though my HN comments to find the cite for that one, and it was behind a paywall).<p>So, considering how difficult all this is, outcomes must be much better for those STEM grads, right?  Well, no, not really.  CS is a good major at the undergrad level, and grads do pretty well.  But again, at the elite level, top software developers, even from elite CS schools with grad degrees, just don&#x27;t pull it in like dermatologists or radiologists.  I read a pretty heartbreaking story about a woman who was denied the right to use sick leave for maternity leave from her grad program.  My cousin, a radiologist, worked part time (20 hour weeks) for a while when she had a kid, and she still pulled down more than my salary as a developer.  I know another woman who is an emergency medicine physician who did the same thing.  They are so, so, so much better off not going into science. A RAND study found that the American aversion to STEM graduate degrees in favor of professional degrees is economically rational and shouldn&#x27;t be a head scratcher.  The head scratcher is why people still act like the only thing we need to do to get more people into science is &quot;make it cool&quot;, or &quot;improve middle school math&quot;, and so forth.<p>We have got to stop acting like there&#x27;s something surprising here.  Science gets kids who are very smart and utterly devoted but perhaps lacking in wisdom, and who just can&#x27;t believe that they might be in the bottom half of a cohort with high grades in STEM coursework and test scores above 95%ile.  Or, alternatively, they are students who don&#x27;t have these other options (US med and law schools are not nearly as accessible to international students as engineering and science PhD programs are).  So if the &quot;professions&quot; are cut off to you because you aren&#x27;t a US citizen, your decision to go into a graduate STEM program (especially if it fast tracks you to US residency) may be rational in a way that wouldn&#x27;t hold for someone who already possesses US citizenship (who typically shun science PhD programs).",1415204038

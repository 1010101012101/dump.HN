If we get this iteration wrong we&#x27;re doomed to fail. Basically we needed to add a whole new level to our pyramid and we need to find people we can delegate tasks to do that the process scales and so everything has come to a grinding halt for a few months.

The actual effect on profitability is likely to be positive, not negative, because better people will stay for longer, less churn means more stability and less random technical debt for new hires, and better publicity makes it easier to keep customers than lose them.<p>Bezos seems to think the tradeoffs are fine as they are. I think he&#x27;s wrong about that. Amazon&#x27;s model is quite brittle, and it&#x27;s open to any number of competitive attacks.

The mechanics of switching input methods on iOS are pretty terrible so it is really inconvenient to have to switch into Japanese input mode. I searched for &quot;hana&quot; but got only 花合わせ and 花を引く as matches -- because those have &#x27;hana&#x27; in the English definition string. Searching for はな brought the two obvious matches (花 and 鼻) to the top, but I had to go back and cycle through several other input methods to get to Japanese input mode, which was annoying and took longer than the rest of looking up the word. Some other dictionaries do this, and even sites like Amazon Japan now do this for searches as well -- dealing with input methods is just a hassle in general.<p>2. The understanding of verb conjugation seems really awesome and jumping between things on a &quot;learning tangent&quot; works really well.<p>3. You <i>have to</i> sync vocab lists and spaced repetition drill status/progress to the cloud. It&#x27;s just too useful not to do it -- you want to be able to do that in quick downtime moments from any device. Luckily there are many easy ways to do it nowadays.

If you searched the codebase,\n      you wouldn&#x27;t find it. If you looked at the class, you couldn&#x27;t see which\n      methods you could call, which made it harder to discover other calls,\n      such as ifNotNullSetName.\n    * IDEs can&#x27;t autocomplete the code.\n</code></pre>\nWhat this boils down to is metaprogramming. If you want to create an array that contains twenty items, you aren&#x27;t going to do:<p><pre><code>    array.add(1);\n    array.add(2);\n    array.add(3);\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;ll use a loop, some imperative code. That&#x27;s because data structures like arrays are within the domain of things you can touch with code.<p>But what about class definitions? What if you want to add twenty methods to a class? Fans of dynamic languages will rightly say that class definitions, functions, etc. should also be in the domain of what your code can affect. Smalltalkers and Rubyists will happily write imperative code to build and modify classes.<p>This is really powerful. It&#x27;s exciting stuff.<p>At the same time, for better or worse, most programmers are not spending their day in a live editing environment. They aren&#x27;t in a Smalltalk browser all day. They&#x27;re in an IDE or text editor.<p>That means the window into the program that we have <i>while editing</i> doesn&#x27;t see any of the results of that metaprogramming. All of the static analysis tools, auto-completers, go-to-definition-ers, etc. can&#x27;t handle dynamic metaprogramming because they run <i>before</i> any of that metaprogramming is invoked.<p>Code generation is a way out of that problem. It lets you do imperative dynamic metaprogramming, but then bakes the result back out to the file system where the rest of your tool ecosystem can see it.<p>It&#x27;s not the most elegant solution in the world, but I think it beats trying to reinvent the entire world of tooling that programmers use all day: grep, text editors, IDEs, etc.",1440112016

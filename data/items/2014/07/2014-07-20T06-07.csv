8059786,comment,8059539,8059539,5,0,narrator,,,"China can make all the bad investments they want.  Unlike any other western country, the government prints their own money debt free and can thus just bail out all the bad loans forever.  The boom bust cycle is just an aspect of fractional reserve / debt as money banking.  In China the banks operate like partially privatized central planning and are closely directed by the government.  There is such extreme cognitive dissonance about this in the western financial press.  They just don&#x27;t get why China doesn&#x27;t bust.  Check out the history of Chinese bail outs and bad loans.  It&#x27;s really quite interesting.  Loans and funds and banks and all that fail all the time in China and the government just prints up some money and bails them out if they&#x27;re politically important.  Goof ball investment schemes which are the Chinese equivalent of LTCM fail all the time and everybody loses their money and nobody bats an eye in China, but it doesn&#x27;t bring the system down.",1405839369

When real estate prices fall, it means that people are most likely getting less wealthy.<p>That uses real estate prices as an indicator for how the economy is doing. However, it doesn&#x27;t mean the economy gets better because real estate prices are up. This almost reminds me of the backyard furnaces during the great leap forward. Metal output was seen as a indicator of good industry and so Mao had everyone melt perfectly good pots and pans and other stuff to improve the indicator. However, most of the metal was useless and the pots and pans were gone.<p>What the article described sounds similar to me. Housing prices are way up, economy indicator looks great, but people are living on the street.<p>> What you&#x27;re describing here is called &quot;re-financing&quot;, it&#x27;s a perfectly normal means of borrowing money against your house if you have enough collateral. I&#x27;ve never heard of people doing it so that money goes back into the economy, it&#x27;s usually to re-invest money into your house like for construction or whatever, and your monthly payment just increases.<p>So the money does go back into the economy.\nAlso: Not all re-financing results in a larger mortgage than before. Some people re-finance to get lower interest rates on the same or smaller principal.",1405839202

In fact, they stem from a sense of how things should work and asking them lead to exploration to why things aren&#x27;t as we expected.  That&#x27;s how interesting and awesome things are discovered.<p>I don&#x27;t have all the answers as this issue is very complex.<p>I try to answer parts of it based on what I know (from travels in China and reading articles about China).<p>First, there really aren&#x27;t that many ways to invest your money in China.  The equity market there is quite nascent and rocky.  Fraud happens quite a bit more than the US and there simply aren&#x27;t that many choices.  The finance industry in China is underdeveloped and heavily regulated.<p>The other issue is that a lot of the money was borrowed from state owned banks when lending was cheap and there was a lot less accountability.<p>Lastly, China runs a pretty big trade surplus.<p>So basically the conditions lead to a situation where China was or still is awash in capital and very few places to invest.  Real estate really isn&#x27;t that bad of a choice.  China moved 500 million people out of poverty and into the middle class in the last couple of decades.  Those people will want places to live.  In the long term, real estate in China isn&#x27;t a bad bet but all that wealth China created need to trickle down to people and get spread among the larger population so they can afford to live in these new places.<p>Just as a general observation, China&#x27;s development is very uneven.  They are good at what they&#x27;ve focused on but lacking systematically (for example, great highways and roads but no one really enforcing traffic laws so people drive the wrong way all the time).  They lack larger systems that make everything work together.  Those things can&#x27;t just happen overnight like China&#x27;s manufacturing industry did.  It will take time for them to realize the problems and find solutions to them.",1405837096

I know where I can find basic information for incorporating existing affordances like those in WAI-ARIA, but I haven&#x27;t a clue where one would start learning the basic underlying principles for designing any fundamentally graphical system for eventual use by the blind.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m one of the software engineers at famo.us and I&#x27;m genuinely curious about knowing how to start designing accessibility features normally found in operating systems, rich application frameworks and windowing systems (qt, kde, gnome, cocoa, wpf, UIKit, AppKit, etc.) from first principles.<p>At the end of the day, at famo.us we&#x27;re fundamentally exploring and implementing concepts in client-side JavaScript that have historically been the domain of the user agent makers and been implemented directly in browsers and accessibility tools like screen readers. With that in mind, do you know of people/projects/efforts to implement accessibility features directly in JavaScript? If not, what kind of accessibility features would you like to see that could be implemented in client-side JavaScript?<p>At the end of the day, HTML Documents have always been linear in nature, but applications are fundamentally non-linear, so a lot of the concepts I&#x27;m familiar with don&#x27;t exactly map to what we&#x27;re doing with scene graphs. Furthermore, the trend for interface designers to explore z-depth as an affordance makes things simpler for sighted users, but I would imagine complicates things for visually impaired users.<p>Lastly, besides the recently founded &quot;a11ybay&quot;, are there any other notable developer communities/meetups you know of in or around San Francisco where one can meet engineers specializing in accessibility.<p>related:<p>[0] The Extensible Web Manifesto <a href=""http://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/</a><p>[1] a11ybay <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/a11ybay/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/a11ybay/</a>",1405836682

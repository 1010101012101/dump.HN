It's in the evolution instinct of married people to have the best environment to bring up kids, which means financial stability.  Having huge debt would make you less attractive since you will make the union's financial situation worse.  The other side being significantly well-off often mitigates the problem, so just look for rich people to marry if one is deep in the hole.",1283623191

For real nice game development, you don't simply want OpenGL or even an engine like Ogre. You want to extend the engine to include physics and collision detection.<p>So, there would need to be either a large enough crowd able to maintain the bindings for the engines and their extensions, or we need a more generic approach to C++ foreign library access. Since there are people working on better C and C++ FFI's,<p>I'm hoping for the latter. But that's probably mostly because I'm no good at C++, and such a layer would be my only way to use external libraries without available bindings.",1283621072

This would cost the Treasury (because, for example, an investor's tax bill would be reduced by the amount of a $100,000 investment by $100,000, and the payroll taxes collected on $100,000 paid in wages would be less than $100,000), but I think it would be a simple and wonderful way to encourage direct investments into companies and create jobs.</i><p>Am I misunderstanding this, or is it really as loony as I think it is?

1662986,comment,1660297,1660695,0,0,sshumaker,,,"Well, the idea that simply 'queueing the rest in userspace' is OK illustrates a pretty disconcerting lack of understanding in writing networking code.  This is not an acceptable solution in the real world.<p>I want to correct that assumption right now - it's one of those places that higher level networking libraries often fall down - because simply 'fire and forget' is a leaky abstraction.<p>Let's say you're streaming a large file over TCP to a client. Generally, disk reads are far faster than you can send data over the internet.  If you naively keep sending data, you'll quickly fill up the OS buffers - and begin to consume memory as it's queued on the client side.  In an extreme case, if you're sending a multi-GB file, you'll probably end up with most of the file sitting in RAM (assuming you don't run of ram and start thrashing).  And for what?  You really only need to load additional data in from the file as fast as you can send it in the socket.<p>In a real-life case, streaming multiple files to multiple clients, you'll quickly run out of RAM with even moderate size files.<p>Some high level libraries provide an event to let you know that the OS buffers have been emptied out.  For example, Node.js has a drain event. But this has to be handled explicitly, and isn't really highlighted in the docs.  But if you write your code naively, you will definitely run into problems.<p>While it's great that many of these high level networking libraries have tried to abstract away many of the complexities of network programming, they're also a trap for the unwary.  Just remember that they aren't a silver bullet that let you handle sending data over the internet as a simple function call.",1283620003

2717198,comment,2716714,2717169,7,0,Jach,,,"Reuse is a problem, but weak passwords are the biggest problem. If you have a strong password that never gets cracked/leaked/intercepted but you use it everywhere you're still fine, but that's not recommended.<p>Generating server-side passwords is horrible as well since you're counting on the user to write it down and/or let the browser's password manager save it. What if the user wants to log in with a different machine/browser?<p>I think the best solution is to, first, forbid passwords under 10 characters. 8 is still relatively secure, but not really, 10 at least gives you a fighting chance. Second, run your own dictionary attack (you can load /usr/share/dict/words into a hashtable and check for membership in sub-second times..in fact, here:<p><pre><code>    import sys
    f = open('/usr/share/dict/words')
    words = {}
    for line in f:
      words[line.replace('\n','')] = None
    
    if sys.argv[1] in words:
      print 'You fail'
</code></pre>
) and alert the user if their password sucks and to pick a new one. (You might want to check for membership of their password with an 's' or a '1' or something added on as well.) You might also want to do some sort of complexity analysis as well that requires e.g. at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number.<p>The infrastructure problem is places like Banks saying ""Enter a password between 6 and 12 characters and only use alphanumeric characters!""",1309499474

Most of the terrible code on the internet is in PHP/MySQL, and most of the PHP/MySQL code is terriblebut that is not a deficiency of the language, but rather a consequence of its ease of use and popularity.<p>That, though, in no way means that you can't build a good, secure website on the LAMP stack.<p>It's just a (rather obvious) fact that if you're a bad developer, then you're going to build an insecure site, most likely on LAMP. If you're a good developer, you're probably going to build a good site, which might be on a less common platform, but equally as (or more) likely on LAMP, too.",1309496818

Thats currently unparalleled in the tablet space, and it needs this level of sensitivity in order to function as a notepad and effectively record the tiniest details in handwritten notes. While handwriting can be slower than typing long reams of text, it gives much greater freedom than a laptop to use personal shorthand and entire document freedom, as well as opens up the possibility to easily add mathematical or scientific formula. This makes business meetings or lecture note taking much easier.<p>ASUS docs state the touchscreen also has 256 levels of sensitivity so it knows how hard youre pressing, which can mean the difference between a dot, a dash and a stroke, and even though the EA800 only has a monochrome display it features 64 grey levels between black and white for at least some measurable level of contrast.

Any legitimate complaints that I've heard are either something we're resolving or is an inherent problem that any social networking site will face.""  Wow -- this is nothing but a big swig of FB koolaid.<p>There's a huge difference in the way that Facebook and Google look at privacy and data ownership.  And I think that difference comes from the founders of each company and has become firmly embedded in each company's DNA.<p>The difference has a name: Mark Zuckerberg.<p>Zuckerberg is an obviously amoral individual who has a history of violating other people's privacy (e.g. breaking into their email accounts) and who believes that all personal information should by default be public.  He also has stated that freedom of speech is culturally relative, in a repulsive attempt to curry favor with the Chinese government.  Contrast that with the bold stand that Google took when the Chinese government demanded that the company acquiesce in their repression of Chinese citizens.<p>Unlike FB, Google doesn't have a history of constantly changing privacy policies and making it very difficult to preserve privacy.  And unlike FB, Google doesn't make it virtually impossible for a user to export the data that lives in their various services.  In fact, provision of plans for export is a key requirement for Google products.<p>Google: don't be evil.
FB: eh, who cares -- we're talking about making money here.",1309496548

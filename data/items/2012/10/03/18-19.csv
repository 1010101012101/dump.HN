Innovation would never work if people didn't take risks and only used what they were familiar with. You can look at the founders of the company and see that we have good experience: I'm an entrepreneur who's used to working with devs (founding member of FeeFighters) and my partner is a developer who used to be freelance and would have loved this service. We speak technical and understand the challenges. 2) We are working on building our reputation and will only be as good as our matches...especially in the beginning. I'd be happy to chat with you (or anyone) and clearly explain everything that goes into matching...it just all doesnt fit on a landing page!",1349290769

I actually <i>have</i> managed to keep these people as close friends, but it got really tough going at times. :(<p>The thing that got really really hard for me, though, is that I no longer really just have ""friends"" in the sense of ""someone you can tell your problems to"".<p>Here is an example: let's say work sucks, or things are going badly in some negotiation, or maybe you literally jut hate your job that day and feel like going off on a massive ""I wish I could just quit all of this"" rant.<p>It no longer works to do this with your friends: they now have both emotional and economic incentives to argue with you, become frustrated at your opinions, or, even worse, themselves feel bad about their own lives.<p>In the other direction, I often feel the need to avoid hanging out with some of the people I most cherish in my life, as I know if I do they will ask after the status of something I should have done, or start asking me questions about something they should do.<p>The result is that I'm, in a way, not even allowed to have work/life separation anymore: whereas I'm totally fine with the idea ""this is just dinner, can we not talk about work?"", it is nearly impossible to get everyone else to abide.<p>I therefore have actually been quite happy as some of my friends have gotten larger jobs elsewhere (I really was mostly doing extreme part-time hiring as contractors) as I now can interact with them ""normally"".<p>(Now, that all said, I also feel I have seen this ""work better"" in a previous company I was a part of, but I can't help but wonder if it was because I was the employee as opposed to the employer.)<p>(I don't really hear my friends complaining about this interaction, for example; that said, maybe they just wouldn't tell me, due to this very same underlying bug.)",1349290763

But if you expect people to trust a new company out of the blue, all you will get is developers with no other options, and chances are there is a reason they have no other options.<p>2) <i>Matchist needs to give the clients a way to ensure that they will receive quality work</i>.

The trick is figuring out where to be on the spectrum.<p>For example, perhaps the simplest solution would be to cron a script that checks 'df' output and sends an email as soon as you hit some reasonable threshold.<p>More complex but significantly more powerful is running something along the lines of Nagios to monitor not only disk usage, but a plethora of other systems level checks.<p>Once that road is walked it's not a big leap to start monitoring the application itself.<p>Why stop there? If you've got your metrics system (like Graphite) up and running, you can pull in raw metrics and trend your disk usage over time. Write a script that pulls in the raw data (add rawData=true to your parameters in Graphite) and then set thresholds on that. Have Graphite take the standard deviation of your disk metric and now you're alerting not only on an absolute threshold, but monitoring for sudden <i>spikes</i> in activity.<p>You may also very well be able to get ""more complex"" without your own infrastructure ... with the tradeoff being money and relying on 3rd party SaaS. There are pros and cons involved here.<p>Circle back, for a second, though. Putting in a complex solution that gives you the kitchen sink requires time and money. Nagios and Graphite are adding a layer of complexity that may be totally overblown for your needs at the moment. SaaS might not fit the bill. Right now may NOT be the time to go all crazy. So start simple. Get that cron job in place today, gain a little piece of mind, and then figure out what your next steps should be.",1349290354

The more attuned you are to the global tech development at large and the macroeconomic environment, the more you realize that these ""stable"" companies aren't what they used to be 30 years ago. These companies aren't supposed to have layoffs, yet you see companies from NEC to Sharp cutting workers in the thousands now. The lifetime earnings of a bigcorp guy was said to be $3MM before; now, it's estimated as $2MM for the younger guys.<p>Second, I think that ""high tech startups"" have gained significant popular acceptance in Japanese society, which has allowed them to exit bigcorps without being socially stigmatized. (Before, I think it would have hard to even find someone to marry as a startup dude. My friend makes as much money from his website via affiliate ads as he does from his bigcorp job, yet he can't leave the bigcorp since he needs it as a shield against society judging him negatively).<p>That being said, leaving a big corp is still an outlier.

I also think that targeting specific professions through immigration programs (while restricting mobility in others) can end up distorting the market badly and deterring US Citizens from entering these fields, something that could badly harm the US economy in the long term.<p>To me, this is almost completely unrelated to the question of whether we should make it easier for high skilled immigrants to come to the US in a more generalized way (like Canada or Australia's points system).  To that question, I'd answer ""yes"".<p>In general, I think this is an honest misunderstanding, but I do think that some of the PR machinery behind the lobbying for specialized visas does take deliberate advantage of the ambiguity.",1349288912

In the sign up flow, we automatically subscribe new users to other users on the site who are active and follow the same teams, and this is explained clearly to the user in the sign up flow. Once the user completes the sign up flow, he lands on the feed, which shows interesting stuff the people he is following have shared about his teams. Since the feed is such a universally well-understood UI construct, users get it, and we see a good percentage of our first time users reshare an item or comment on an item on their first visit.<p>We also send out a welcome email (which weve been experimenting with) which explains more details about the site and how to get the most out of it.

All other parts needed are, by law, mere accessories. (Note that law is often very different from practical and/or social reality.) Buy those parts mail-order, and (so long as barrel is over 16"" and total length exceeds 26"") it's legal and functioning. Of course, ""printing"" the lower receiver at this point still suffers precision and strength issues, but just a matter of time before serious metals can be used and the item hardened. The great thing about doing this with the AR15 lower receiver is that it serves more to just screw all the real precision-and-strength parts together, while being less so itself.<p>The problem with most lawmakers is all too often they know little about what they're legislating about, consenting to the demands of the ignorant and biased to circumvent restrictions rather than addressing realities in a straightforward Constitutional manner.

Ensure that the object you're testing the behavior of sends the right messages to its collaborators but put the tests for those messages in the unit test for the collaborator. This keeps your tests isolated and fast. As long as you adhere to ""Tell, Don't Ask"" you should simply be able to assert that your method is sending messages to other objects without relying on the behavior that those methods perform.<p><pre><code>    Create only the data you need\n\n    describe ""User""\n      describe "".top"" do\n        before { 3.times { Factory(:user) } }\n        it { User.top(2).should have(2).item }\n      end\n    end\n\n</code></pre>\nThe author advocates not creating dozens of objects but why make any at all?

I usually do something like this (using rspec-mocks):<p><pre><code>    subject.should_receive(:popular).and_return(subject)\n    subject.should_receive(:by_create_date).and_return(subject)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nThis lets you know that the class method is performing the filtering you want without actually fetching data from the db. Much like validations, this is the kind of thing you can rely on either the Rails team or the db adapter writers to get the actual filtering right without having to test this over and over in your app. Having your unit tests (business logic!) actually hit your persistence layer like this is the kind of thing that makes test suites slow!",1349287715

They don't let the boys and girls go to school together, so the boys go in the morning and the girls go in the afternoon to prevent intermingling. Thus each student gets only half the instructional time as students in any other country. Merry Christmas.",1198550260

Arricept, Huperzine, and other chemicals inhibit acetylcholinesterase formation (and therefore increase acetylcholine levels). If your brain acetylcholine levels are low then certain substances may help in the formation of additional acetylcholine (e.g in addition to DMAE there are other compounds like choline, CDP choline, Alpha GPC, and PPC). If your equilibrating mechanisms are working then small amounts of precursors shouldn't cause a derangement. Athletes taking steroids are attempting to overload the equilibrating mechanisms to build muscle. Choline precursors don't seem to have these same ""down-regulation"" harmful side effects when taken in moderation to bring brain acetylcholine levels back into ""normal range."" I am not advocating steroids or supplement use, but it seems to me that they have two different usage patterns: steroid use involves intentionally boosting levels outside of the normal range for ""performance enhancing"" results, where the DMAE use described by  Hexayurt was in response to ""programmer burnout"" which likely involved depleted acetylcholine levels in the brain and was in his own words ""performance restoring.""<p>In terms of the hacker news angle, I would think all things in moderation in the context of development plans that rely on efforts that are sustainable over a long period of time.<p>A references on choline for memory formation improvement:<p><a href=""http://sciencenewsmagazine.org/articles/20031122/food.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sciencenewsmagazine.org/articles/20031122/food.asp</a>",1198549419

The obvious way to hijack is to pull a Facebook on Facebook itself -- ask for your FB password and then copy out all your information, and msg all your friends.<p>If you could click a button and do a horizontal transfer to an equivalent service any time some other service crossed the line of what's acceptable to you, people would migrate in droves.  Big companies survive because of <i>inertia</i> -- the truly disruptive technology that the Net should enable is to remove it.<p>Facebook's evil ways will doom it.",1198548134

If neither you nor your customers require your personal attention to X, you should ideally not be X-ing, because you and your customers require your personal attention on enough things as it is.<p>[Incidentally: Telling your parents and friends about your internal deadlines as a motivational tool is pretty useful.  Telling your customers is a great way to get unproductively stressed when life gets in the way.  Your parents and friends will still be there later if your schedule slips a week because your girlfriend needed more face time.

Why not just say ""bad church?""  And since there's little point in distinguishing between Scientology the religion and the Church of Scientology, you should really say ""bad <i>religion</i>.""<p>I'm somewhat being intentionally inflammatory, but it's interesting to examine the difference between what I said and what Raphael said.  The line I crossed was saying that Scientology could be bad and still be a religion.  Funny that people start shying away from such statements when they stop believing in a particular religion.  If atheism is ""just one god/mythos further,"" then what do we call our modern attitude of attempting to feel positively inclined toward all religions while believing in none of them?  What do we call the idea that critical appreciation of religion, religion separated from belief and disbelief, is not essentially different from religion as practiced by most people since the dawn of history?",1243612128

However, it is also helpful to put up a few countervailing arguments:<p>(1) Whether the psychiatric profession knows anything much is a legitimate question. See for example,<p><a href=""http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/rosenhan-experiment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/rosenhan-experiment/</a>

<a href=""http://www.szasz.com/freeman15.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.szasz.com/freeman15.html</a><p>(2) The diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia seem incoherent and lacking in empirical content. Prostate cancer, OTOH, is an uncontroversially real condition with clear cut symptoms and diagnosis.<p>(3) Being labelled with a mental disorder can be a huge stigma that you have to deal with for the rest of your life. It might affect, for example, your job prospects and your parenting propects. (People are learning in the UK that new mothers are unwise to admit feeling depressed to medical staff.)<p>(3) Everybody has voices or at least one voice in their heads. It is just that only a few people such as the poster and Richard Feynman have the necessary self-awareness and intellectual integrity to talk about them openly.<p>As Eckhart Tolle might say, the real question is whether one <i>identifies</i> with the chattering voice. People who are completely identified don't perceive it as an external entity, but it is still there: they <i>are</i> the voice.<p>(4) Such voices are thoughts, and many of our thoughts are random and contradictory. When we daydream (or dream at night) they are connected only by loose associations. Nobody really has control of their thoughts. Try drinking 6 cups of coffee after a 24 hour fast and watch the cascade begin!<p>(5) By listening to our thoughts and becoming more aware of them we remain in control of our actions. Just because we have a particular thought, it doesn't follow we must enact it. The psychiatric profession is all about regulating people's <i>behaviour</i> for social reasons.",1243611859

  and since Sandell and Johnson received project text files 
  in various formats, Perl's ability to parse text with 
  regular expressions was much better than COBOL or 
  Oracle's PL/SQL.

These aren't the comparisons that would be made today, though I am <i>very</i> proud of Perl, having beaten COBOL and PL/SQL in a regex contest!<p>I also enjoyed the time-travel qualities of the conclusion of that section:<p><pre><code>  They wrote the Web applications in Jscript, and other 
  parts of the system in Visual Basic. Some functions were 
  written in PL/SQL so they could be accessible from other 
  languages using the system. ""If we did the project again, 
  we would probably strive to make more of it in Perl,"" 
  Sandell concedes. But with so little time, they couldn't 
  ask team members to learn a new language.
</code></pre>
JScript no longer exists, unless it's a misnomer for JavaScript.  Is it considered best practice to use code rather than stored procedures?  (The question is genuine -- I'm not a software developer.)",1243611757

They don't all agree on exactly which constructs, of course, and the example they use to show their particular point of view invariably fit on a single page of some obscure journal or another-- clearly not enough of an example to convince anyone. When I got out of school, I thought I was the best programmer in the world. I could write an unbeatable tic-tac-toe program, use five different computer languages, and create 1000 line programs that WORKED (Really!). Then I got out into the Real World. My first task in the Real World was to read and understand a 200,000 line program, then speed it up by a factor of two.

It seems to me that mathematics could lead us <i>directly</i> to the right model without mistakes... or is the truth that the same trial-and-error still occurs, but just in more abstract and general terms? Does that seem right to the mathematicians here?<p><i>... the nature of design, as they discovered, is so intensely cognitive, happening inside the mind at mind speed, the researchers could conceive of no useful tools to help in that process!</i><p>This is exactly my experience. The closest is diagrams with pen-and-paper, but it doesn't help that much. The more difficult part is not solving the problem, but showing that you've solved it i.e. a proof, for all possible cases.

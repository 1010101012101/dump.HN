2040889,comment,2039503,2040339,0,0,pelle,,,"The whole problem with these scaremongering articles about equality and the lack of it is that it doesn't matter. They promote this because it fits in to their zero sum world view. A world where it is always someone-elses fault and where we as community must do something or we are selfish. This world view thats based on Dickensian stories of children living on the streets with coal dust on their cheeks. It just isn't true.<p>I find it particularly disturbing that these thoughts even find an outlet on HN which is the antithesis of the zero sum world. You, yes you coder, entrepreneur are part of building wealth out of nothing. How can you possibly think that by doing so you are stealing food out of the mouthes of poor children in the inner city. You are helping them in the long run by growing the economy.<p>To a poor person objectively speaking it doesn't matter on anything but an envy level if someone else is rich. What matters is their own life. And this is what Gini coefficients and graphs like this one doesn't show. Yes it's interesting that people have different views of this, but it is not important.<p>Imagine we can put a number on quality of life. If the poor person starts out at say 1 and is at 10 after 10 years (as has happened in many developing countries). Does it matter that the rich person also is 10 times better off or even 100 times better off? I don't think so. That poor person now is healthier, has better opportunities etc than before.<p>The children of this poor person will likely have a much better life while inequality might not have budged much in his country.<p>See Hans Rosling who illustrates this very well:<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_on_poverty.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_o...</a><p>America is a very unequal country that is true. Just not unequal in opportunities. The richest people in the US (the ones with 80% of the wealth) have probably in most cases earned it.<p>Many of them have come from other parts of the world and created lots of jobs both here and abroad. Due to the fact that there are so many opportunities wealth distribution of course is skewed towards the rich.<p>Another fact that simple populist statistics don't show is that many of the poor are new immigrants arriving here because of those same opportunities. Their kids will be considerably well off.<p>Just by virtue of the HN community being who we are, we should keep doing our bit to increase the overall wealth of our world and countries, even if we may end up with more than our ""fair"" share.",1293386392

No matter how much you accomplished - or didnâ€™t - you stayed in the same station of life.</i><p>Ye, this isn't really true. Lets take, for example, 18th century Naval officers from the UK:<p>* Captain Cook - discovered Australia, mapped the Pacific etc. Father was a farmer<p>* Horatio Nelson - Defeated the French, considered greatest Naval commander of all time. Father was a minister<p>* Arthur Philip - Commander during American Revolution, lead colonization of Australia. Father was a teacher.<p>It is a very common misconception that in old society it was impossible to move from the lower classes into the upper classes. The British Empire, the prototypical aristocracy, was largely shaped and developed by people who were raised in the lower classes. This is because the military, navy, their universities (eg. Isaac Newton), and many other parts of government and private societies were strict meritocracies.<p>The upper classes actually produced a very small number of notable people, outside of royalty (Charles Darwin, Churchill, Brunel (although his grandfather was a French farmer)<p>(Edit: <i>""America became the first large-scale experiment of a society that could be called a meritocracy.""</i> - Citation needed.

Recently, I've decided to invest some hard-earned money in building a cloud-based service to expand the product line but also to hedge against the hosting trends.<p>While scouring the Web for smart folks that could be a good fit for the project, I'm appalled at the stubbornness that's plaguing these people. Almost all are mentally fixated on X software or Y development method and none are considering the business side of things: hitting deadlines, semantics must not get in the way of building the product, customers must get what they want (reasonably), use Z because it makes sense even though you've poured your heart&soul in X over the last few years.<p>This is worrying because I don't want this stubbornness to affect the direction of the project and the product. I think I'm giving a good incentive to join the venture (pay+ownership). This is such a turnoff for me that I find it wasteful to strike some of these skilled folks off the short list.<p>What to do?<p>Regards<p>Joe",1293385619

Instead, it's a node-based GPU-accelerated compositing system of my own devising. Layers and effects are rendered using OpenGL.<p>Because there's no browser engine, there's also no browser-style DOM available in Radi. I've written private implementations of the relevant JavaScript APIs, primarily Canvas. The JavaScript engine used is WebKit's JavaScriptCore, a.k.a. Nitro in its current accelerated incarnation.<p>The app is native Cocoa, but it's written in a way that's fairly portable. (From my other projects I already have a large part of the core ported to Windows+Direct3D.)",1293385586

For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.</i><p>Strongly implying that in the modern world most large fortunes come from making wealth, but presenting no actual evidence.  From observation, most large fortunes come from trickery: either in markets or by being hired as a CEO and negotiating high, non-measured compensation by abusing conflicts of interest.  I haven't studied the question carefully, though.  Has anyone?<p>He also strawmans the pure-pie model.  The real pie model looks something like this.  A very large group of people collaborate to create something of value (even in software, there are library authors, hardware makers, ISP maintainers...).  Some are part of the same company.  Some are tied in via contracts, shaped by negotiators.  Once the good is made, the wealth is divided up among the team.  (Simultaneously, the team works on the next hunk of wealth -- it's a pipeline, not an alternator.)  It is meaningful to look at the distribution phase in isolation, with the caveat that how the distribution phase impacts the production phase is <i>a</i> factor in how good the distribution model is.",1293385188

The word meritocracy comes from a book of the same title written in 1958 by Michael Young (interesting fella, wrote the UK Labour Party's manifesto in 1945, founded the Open University).<p>The point about meritocracy is that it is a satirical term. (The beauty of it being that in any society the wealthy and powerful can claim they rose on merit. In the time of the Divine Right Of Kings, merit was being chosen by God.)<p>But don't take my word for it, read Michael Young on the subject in 2001.<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/jun/29/comment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/jun/29/comment</a>",1293383953

They knew they needed to get out of &quot;pure&quot; Lego and diversify (licensing, older demos) but went about it the wrong way (trying to become a lifestyle brand). What we see today is a turnaround effort by brought-in CEO Jørgen Vig Knudstorp who figured out how to help the Lego brand adapt and survive the changes in the market, one major component being all of the tie-ins to the entertainment industry. [1]<p>Today, we&#x27;re seeing a decline in toy sales due to video games [2], something which Lego seems to be ahead of the curve on as well.

7349433,comment,7349122,7349122,6,0,shitlord,,,"I think these changes are long overdue. To me, the CR portion of the SAT seemed incredibly biased against people from other cultures. Not only was there a language barrier, but also there was the problem of allusions. Many of the passages contained references to things that you wouldn&#x27;t expect a typical immigrant to know (things like Greek mythology, the indulgences of the wealthy, cultural icons, etc).<p>I think the waivers for low-income students are also pretty great. When I was in high school, taking all of the standardized exams cost me hundreds of dollars. I went to school in a place with a lot of gentrification, so a lot of my classmates could barely afford to get their high school transcript (let alone pay to take tests). There were many efforts to get the school system to subsidize standardized exams, but they were all unsuccessful.",1394049488

If the person without reasonable understanding of Computer Vision research thinks that he can solve the problem, that is the person&#x27;s problem. Again I wouldn&#x27;t blame the naive software engineer who thinks he can solve these problems, because our (extremely complex) visual process makes it all seem very simple. Even Marvin Minsky thought he could get his undergrad Gerry Sussman to “spend the summer linking a camera to a computer and getting the computer to describe\nwhat it saw”. After almost 60 years we aren&#x27;t very to close that. Sure, we can solve certain problems in most scenarios (like face detection) or many relatively more complex problem in limited variance situations (like machine vision problems).

Perhaps you can even click a button when the cursor is on an identifier, and be taken to the definition of the entity of that name, or the small subset of possible entities of that name that this identifier could refer to? Possibly the computer could check your work without your even having to run it, and actually prove that certain types of error cannot possible occur?<p>That actually sounds really helpful and I&#x27;m not sure why people don&#x27;t embrace it.<p>(One point you do make that is quite correct is that static typing is helpful for novices. And yet so many languages designed for beginners&#x27; use try to make things &quot;easier&quot; by turning typos into new variables, letting variables switch type, and generally poking their user in the eye. Never figured this one out - though I suppose this <i>is</i> good training for the novice programmer, because programming is such a straightforward activity and without having the language itself to keep them on their toes they might find it insufficiently exacting, not demanding enough, and requiring basically nothing in the form of concentration, thought and precision.)",1394049409

I still have an SSN card with just First on it, but I am no longer First according to SSN, because 9/11 and DHS. SSN now mails my documents to First Unk (or maybe the other way around, I don&#x27;t care and don&#x27;t remember).<p>I always try to be First, but often end up falling back to First First, or F. First. The IRS gladly accepts my check associated with my SSN number every year, and I always fill out their form with First in their last name field, which they have so far accepted.<p>I don&#x27;t really care, I know who I am, and no one who knows me calls me anything but First. Sometimes new people call me Mr. First.<p>It&#x27;s not something I care to fight about. I would never saddle my kid with that fight. Your choices are certainly your own.<p>When my son was born, about ten years after I changed my name, I named him HisFirstName First. So we would both have the same family name.  :)",1394049156

Acquire a stake of more than 5%, which requires a public filing with the SEC. This is very key as now the public has a verifiable way of knowing Icahn has a stake.<p>2. Write a letter to the board and/or management demanding changes to the structure of the company or use of its large cash pile(if applicable). This usually takes the form of a spin-off or buyback/dividend proposal. (Buybacks are more favorable these days due to tax considerations.)<p>3. The stock price increases at least 10% after it is announced Icahn has taken a stake. Icahn can sell here and take his profits home; 10% annualized is a very large gain.<p>3. Management predictably scoffs at Icahn&#x27;s demands or arranges a show for shareholders in the form of a one-on-one meeting with the CEO or something along these lines.

7349313,comment,7346454,7348236,4,0,j2kun,,,"I agree wholeheartedly with how frustrating it is. I think part of the problem is that really great mathematicians are encouraged to stay as far away from teaching (and improving their teaching) as possible, and great teachers are often discouraged from pursuing more mathematics for a variety of reasons. And when I personally teach calculus I make sure to explain derivatives in the way you want in the very first day (before describing limits or anything else).<p>As to your second point, I think notation is a big problem, but it&#x27;s a bit of a straw man. With very few exceptions that I doubt you would ever find yourself in, I have never met a professor or mathematician that would not explain notation if you asked (gladly stopping in the middle of a lecture or talk to clarify). There is still a lot of it, but every mathematician who is presenting the mathematics can explain the notation to any degree of precision you could ever want, and I have very few colleagues who have never stopped someone for this reason.<p>I think the bigger problem is trying to read mathematics by yourself, without the ability to ask questions. And even after understanding the notation, I feel programmers have bigger problems, which I&#x27;ve expanded more on in this post [1], the main difference between learning programming being there are simply more free and open resources for learning programming. This is probably because programmers invented the internet and filled it with their favorite content first.<p>But one point I make is that mathematical notation is inherently ad-hoc, and the only kinds of notation that stick around are the kinds that get used ad-hoc enough times to become standard. And even then people will make up their own notation for no other reason than that it&#x27;s their favorite (Physicists are really good at this, and perhaps ironically it drives mathematicians crazy). Because of that (and because notation is introduced often to be rigorous, not to explain a concept) you&#x27;re unlikely to ever find such a dictionary.

Now, the copter has angular momentum along the direction perpendicular to the rotor disk and a vector between the copter&#x27;s center of mass and the working motor, and further that the copter is oriented such that the vector is also parallel to the plane of the ground.<p>As jfoutz said, running the motor (&quot;forward&quot;) when the copter is upright and off otherwise gives you net upward thrust (averaged over time).  It also applies a torque to the copter, which will <i>mostly</i> be parallel to the extant angular momentum vector.  So, a first-order fix is to do what jfoutz said, but also run the motor &quot;backward&quot; (negative thrust) when the copter is upside-down.  However, rotor also generates some torque perpendicular to the rotor plane, which will cause the angular momentum vector to rise above the horizon (since the motor reverses when it is upside-down, the angular momentum vector rotates upward rather than revolving around the original direction of the angular momentum vector).<p>However, if you allow the copter to have some angular momentum (i.e., you <i>don&#x27;t</i> try to completely eliminate it), the rise might be slow enough to be managed by running the motor at other times.  For example, by running the motor when the rotor plane is perpendicular to the ground, you could create  a similar drift in the angular momentum vector.  But now it slowly drifts around the compass instead of rising above the horizon.  If you make the &quot;compass&quot; drift faster than than the &quot;altitude&quot; drift, the torque from the first one will average out to something very small.  So by managing the rate of these two drifts with an appropriate feedback loop, you can probably obtain a stable solution where there is a net upward thrust and the angular momentum vector &quot;slowly&quot; (for possibly large values of slow) precesses along the horizon.",1394048371

Founding at this stage in life is definitely more difficult.  In my early twenties, I dropped out of school, working 19hrs a day and was able to produce a prototype for what would become my full-time business for the subsequent 10 years in a matter of a few months ... But with my last startup, I worked every night from about 10pm-1:30am + &quot;nap time&quot; on weekends, and what should have been 1-2 months of work turned into 9 - with way more compromises than there should have been.  Plus, the time spent tweaking the code actually limited the time I spent on some of the critical business / positioning decisions.<p>(A few times I actually rented a hotel in my city just to sequester myself and jump start the dev process)<p>In terms of elance/odesk, yes, I thought that would be a sketchy approach.  I was actually more interested in production houses (like the kinds that build full-on apps) and contracting them.  I&#x27;ve done similar in my day job, but in that case, they weren&#x27;t so much building the business for us, but just building a marketing hook or an app extension to our core offering.  I&#x27;m a little more skeptical about using them to build the whole thing...<p>The final approach I was considering was simply hiring my first employee as a work-from-home employee/cofounder. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has ever been in this role, how they found it and if/where things went wrong with the &quot;non-technical&quot; cofounder?

Amazing that it&#x27;s been 23 years since its release and it remains as useful as ever.<p>I remember what it was like to watch a 320*200 JPEG image slowly build up on a 386SX PC with a VGA card. Today, a HD frame compressed with JPEG can be decoded in milliseconds. This highlights the secret to JPEG&#x27;s success: it was designed with enough foresight and a sufficiently well-bounded scope that it keeps hitting a sweet spot between computing power and bandwidth.<p>Did you know that most browsers support JPEG video streaming using a plain old <img> tag? It works also on iOS and Android, but not IE unfortunately.<p>It&#x27;s triggered by the &quot;multipart/x-mixed-replace&quot; content type header [0]. The HTTP server leaves the connection open after sending the first image, and then simply writes new images as they come in like it were a multipart file download. A compliant browser will update the image element&#x27;s contents in place.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Mixed-Replace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Mixed-Replace</a>",1394047804

The problem is that many of these structures aren&#x27;t easy to compute with, so we&#x27;re essentially having to work backwards to find a set of formalities that we can both do mechanistically and support the theorems/propositions we&#x27;d like to be true.<p>Mathematicians generally don&#x27;t evaluate the truth of a new paper relative to the axioms, but relative to the already established results in a field.

I have used FontAwesome in the past as well as a few other free alternatives. While the javascript-less-ness of FA is nice (Iconic has a webfont), the quality of the icons themselves and their level of customization comes no where near Iconic. Many people have mentioned the multiple colors on 1 icon but I haven&#x27;t seen anyone talk about the ability to easily theme all icons with just a couple lines of css, which makes the multiple color thing more appealing.<p>Additionally, Iconic is available as Webfont and PNG if so desired. They are also working on a number of additional features that I find interesting (bottom of the features page <a href=""https://useiconic.com/feature-index/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://useiconic.com/feature-index/</a>), specifically ExtendScript for Illustrator and then generation via Grunt.<p>I am pleased with my $35 purchase and have no reservations about paying the $99 for a commercial license if it fits the project (like any icon set you choose!)...However, for those who haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it I really wish there was a cheaper/free option for experimenting.",1394046251

The 4-clause BSD license is a free software license; it just happens not to be compatible with the GPL (not all free software licenses are).<p>The reasons for this are very practical: not only does it place additional restrictions on the software (which is not permitted by the GPL), but if multiple 4-clause BSD projects are used, each project requires its own separate advertising statement (the 4-clause license does not permit combining these into a single sentence): <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html</a><p>> The reason the GPL is annoying is that free license with an advertizing clause have existed for a very long time and are actually widely used.<p>Most modern projects using permissive licenses use 3-clause BSD, MIT/X11, or Apache, all of which are compatible with the GPL.

The exchange of dollar bills, including high denomination bills, is currently unregulated and has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly subject to forgery, theft, and loss. For the reasons outlined below, I urge regulators to take immediate and appropriate action to limit the use of dollar bills.<p>By way of background, a physical dollar bill is a printed version of a dollar note issued by the Federal Reserve and backed by the ephemeral “full faith and credit” of the United States. Dollar bills have gained notoriety in relation to illegal transactions; suitcases full of dollars used for illegal transactions were recently featured in popular movies such as American Hustle and Dallas Buyers Club, as well as the gangster classic, Scarface, among others. Dollar bills are present in nearly all major drug busts in the United States and many abroad. According to the U.S. Department of Justice study, “Crime in the United States,” more than $1 billion in cash was stolen in 2012, of which less than 3% was recovered. The United States’ Dollar was present by the truck load in Saddam Hussein’s compound, by the carload when Noriega was arrested for drug trafficking, and by the suitcase full in the Watergate case.<p>Unlike digital currencies, which are carbon neutral allowing us to breathe cleaner air, each dollar bill is manufactured from virgin materials like cotton and linen, which go through extensive treatment and processing. Last year, the Federal Reserve had to destroy $3 billion worth of $100 bills after a “printing error.” Certainly this cannot be the greenest currency.<p>Printed pieces of paper can fit in a person’s pocket and can be given to another person without any government oversight. Dollar bills are not only a store of value but also a method for transferring that value. This also means that dollar bills allow for anonymous and irreversible transactions.<p>The very features of dollar bills, such as anonymous transactions, have created ubiquitous uses from drug purchases, to hit men, to prostitutes, as dollar bills are attractive to criminals who are able to disguise their actions from law enforcement. Due to the dollar bills’ anonymity, the dollar bill market has been extremely susceptible to forgers, tax fraud, criminal cartels, and armed robbers stealing millions of dollars from their legitimate owners. Anonymity, combined with a dollar bills’ ability to finalize transactions quickly, makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse fraudulent transactions.<p>Many of our foreign counterparts already understand the wide range of problems that physical currencies can have. Many physical currencies have enormous price fluctuations, and even experience deflation.  20 years ago Brazil had an inflation rate of 6281%.  In 4 years (2001 to 2005), the Turkish Lira went from 1,650,000: $1 to 1.29 to $1. In 2009, Zimbabwe discontinued it’s dollar. Before it was eliminated, the Zimbabwe dollar was the least valuable currency in the world and their central bank even issued a $100 trillion dollar banknote. A person would starve on a billion Zimbabwe dollars and it took an entire wheelbarrow full of $100 billion dollars in notes to purchase a loaf of bread.<p>The clear use of dollar bills for transacting in illegal goods, anonymous transactions, tax fraud, and services or speculative gambling make me wary of their use. Before the United States gets too far behind the curve on this important topic, I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.<p>Sincerely,<p>Jared Polis\nMember of Congress \u200B",1394046079

Other databases that don&#x27;t feature strong consistency like Riak and Cassandra don&#x27;t rely on consensus algorithms. Redis also has a form of weak consistency that does not require consensus (the merging function is, in the special case of Redis, just picking the &quot;history&quot; that seems the most updated, plus other systems to try to bound divergence to a given fixed amount).

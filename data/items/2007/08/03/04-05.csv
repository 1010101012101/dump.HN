(yes, I know why this is impossible with browser features, but it's what I expect from a music player) Oh, and it only seems to accept .mp3 files -- I've got a fair number of .ogg, .wma, .aac, etc. That's probably my computer's doing, though, since it wouldn't be a very good iTunes clone without insisting on .aac.",1186116528

Someone has to push the political agenda of the Pirate Party and the more money they have, the more they can change the world.<p>This artificial scarcity of media doesn't make any sense. Why should something that I can get for free cost money?",1186115980

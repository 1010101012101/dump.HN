These guys have a right to be upset, since it's been two months since they first submitted, but they should remember Hanlon's razor when trying to explain things.<p>Rather than trying to cover things up, chances are that the customer service rep honestly has no idea about the IM+ app submission. It's probably not his department.<p>Likewise, rather than RIM deliberately trying to block IM+, the two month delay is probably due to lack of staff, bad prioritization of tasks, or things otherwise falling through the cracks,",1310986753

FWIW during that time I also interviewed in Silicon Valley and got job offers in the Bay Area, but elected to stay in SoCal.  I recently left the US primarily for family reasons and the farcical US immigration system.<p>It's true that there isn't the same concentration of high-tech companies in SoCal compared to Silicon Valley, but then it's a much bigger place in terms of population.

2775765,comment,2774254,2774254,7,0,SeanLuke,,,"As a CS professor with a lot of concern about cheating in general, one sentence stood out to me:<p>> One of the offenders was actually a repeat offender from the prior assignment and was also dismissed from the class.<p>This tells me that this professor who posted the blog entry may not quite understand the problem.<p>Ethics aside, students cheat because they believe that there is a positive utility in doing so.  That is, they believe the expected likelihood of cheating is better than the expected likelihood of turning in their assignment cheat-free, even for a zero.  Ultimately the only way to curb cheating is to make the utility negative.  And not only negative: it has to be so obviously and publicly negative that it shatters the students' own rosy visions of cheating and getting away with it.<p>So what did he do wrong here?  He allowed a student to cheat not once but twice, and then the only punishment was to fail him.  Let us presume that turning in a zero twice, plus average work for the rest, will land you an F.  If there is even an infinitesimal chance of cheating and getting away with it, this tells a desperate student that the net utility of cheating on two assignments is positive.  If you need three zeros to land an F, you still only need a small probability of getting away with it.  And so on.<p>Basically he slapped the students on the hands. He's part of the problem.<p>My recommendation to his institution would be as follows: a minor offense (as ultimately decided by an Honor Court, not the faculty member) would be course failure.  A major first offense would be course failure plus community service.  A second offense would be dismissal from the University with no readmission.  And whenever a student is failed or dismissed, the department lets their students know that such an event occurred (with no details).  Students should be made aware of how often they get caught as a group.<p>Then there was this sentence:<p>> Students would come to my office and deny everything.<p>It sounds to me that he was handling cheating on his own.  This has two very high negatives.  First, it sucked up enormous time on his part when there's a perfectly good institutional mechanism (the Honor Court or whatnot).  Second, punishing such cases on his own opens him up to direct liability.  Faculty can and are sued by students for doing such things.  One of the purposes of an honor court is to have his institution take the liability since they made the decision. He should have simply written the students up, submitted to the honor court, and wiped his hands clean.",1310986233

2775755,comment,2766701,2768749,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"(1) Okay, let's speculate about the actual requirements for robust, easy to maintain software.  Robust means it won't fail easily.  A robust program handles edge cases correctly, and have few errors.  An easy to maintain program is one that is easy to correct or modify.  To achieve this, you must make it so that most modifications require the inspection of relatively few code.  It means the code base must be either small or very well de-coupled.<p>Now let's add ""complicated"".  To me, it means the problem cannot be solved by a small program.  Therefore, the program will be rather big.  To achieve robustness and ease of maintenance, you have to make it locally readable and modular.<p>Now, add ""in C++"".  C++ is <i>extremely</i> permissive.  You can tweak almost anything.  It can be awesome, but there is a flip side:  memory must be handled manually (more code), and you can make fewer assumptions about your program (less modular code).  For an originally complicated problem, this is a significant burden.<p>Now, a very disciplined team <i>could</i> overcome this burden.  Just mind a few things:  Const correctness everywhere, and avoid side effects where you can (this is both extremely important[1] and not easy in C++[2]).  Ban or restrict the use of the more problematic features (I would mostly scrap inheritance, except when emulating Java interfaces).  Use the remaining features in a standardized manner (make sure copy constructors and destructors are correct, use initialization lists systematically or not at all, make everything exception-safe or ban exceptions, use std::auto_ptr<> as much as possible, and probably a gazillion other crucial things I forgot).<p>Some individuals are indeed that disciplined.  But an entire team?  Good luck finding it.<p>(2) The API of most operating systems are sufficiently language independent to allow several languages.  Most languages are sufficiently OS independent to allow the port of programs in several operating systems.  This is basically because an OS API and standard libraries are effectively the two halves of a plug-in system.<p>So, the constraints are very unlike those you find when adding functionality to a program which doesn't have any plug-in system.  I concede that C and C++, as the default API for current operating systems, are favoured.  But the burden on other languages is barely noticeable (except maybe for the language implementer).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/assignment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/assignment</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/avoid-assignment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/avoid-assignment</a>",1310985880

2775722,story,,,4,2,poissonpie,"Show HN: PlaceGuitar - my weekend image placeholder project",,"http://www.placeguitar.com<p>My weekend project is, as you may have guessed, an image placeholder service that serves up guitars! The inspiration came from a tweet (http://twitter.com/#!/zedshaw/status/88126558686019584 ). I decided to hack it together using Python on Google App Engine. The service is simple - pass in your width and height in the url (e.g. www.placeguitar.com/800/600 to get an 800 by 600 image) and get back a random image of a guitar to your size spec. Pop the url in the src of your img tag to use it on a site. That's all it does. There is a quick and dirty admin only form to upload images.<p>The only real challenge was deciding how to scale images. GAE doesn't let you ignore aspect ratio when you resize images which was my original plan for a quick prototype - obviously this wouldn't be very elegant because images would have been distorted for anything that didn't respect the original image's aspect ratio. I settled on scaling to the best approximation and then cropping to centre.<p>The code is on github (https://github.com/poissonpie/Place-Guitar) if anyone is interested. I only tinker in Python now and then so I don't expect it to be all that elegant.<p>I would love any feedback on any aspect of the project.<p>Thanks for looking.",1310984048

Many users you encounter doesn't necessarily equal many FF users. I think what the vast majority of Firefox users love about it is that it is the browser they use, and have used for a long time. In other words, their loyalty doesn't run so deep. Those are the users this move is for, those that use Firefox habitually instead of for some particular reason and could possibly switch to Chrome.<p>> Chrome only has ""lite"" versions of these tools for technical reasons (limited extension API).<p>Not just Chrome, but Safari & Opera as well. There is a reason for that, it's because it's the smarter way to go. Firefox's extension system is a massive cause of headaches for Mozilla. It's going to go eventually, the only question is how soon.<p>> So I agree that the very rapid release schedule is the problem here. It brings more problems than it solves.<p>Problems for you, you mean. Rapid release, seamless updates and a less invasive extension system solves big problems for Mozilla and most end users, problems that are causing them to switch to Chrome.<p>> Just because Google does something, does not mean it is good for everyone.<p>Likewise, just because devs want it doesn't mean it's worth compromising the experience for everyone else.

I had to end firefox's process in the end. <p>More and more I think about switching to a webkit-based browser or opera, although I've never found opera all that great. I really like firefox's UI but it's too much of a resource hog these days. ",1195638965

That means that it's also a bit of an outlier in terms of lines of code, people involved, and so on, which is why Linus seems to have undertaken the painful project of making his own revision control thing.<p>I'll wait till he's shaken the bugs out until I give it a go, though, as being an early adopter gives me zero competitive advantage.",1195638701

Last time I checked, other technologies are rarely backward compatible, cut support for previous version not too long after new release is out, tons of controversies on newer releases. <p>One choice is not to upgrade at all. No big deal I assume. It's not like you're going to write a lot more of new code.<p>What makes you think open standards are better? just because they're open thus they're better? how about the technology value behind it? <p>'One Microsoft Way' isn't overly bad. At least it doesn't waste your time trying to decide which one is better (Rails vs PHP vs Django vs TurboGears vs Pylons vs Symfony vs JSF). <p>You know what, these are the example of wasting your time:<p>Servlet (need template)-> JSP/Servlet (not good enough) -> Struts (some design mistakes) -> Spring (mkay.. well) -> JSF (oh, we finally catch ASP.NET up)<p>PHP -> PEAR -> Symfony/CakePHP/Ignition<p>I wouldn't say Python stack is ""wasting your time"" yet but time will tell how long Django/TurboGears/Pylons will last. They're cool frameworks and I like Python more than C#. But I haven't really heard much from their communities lately other than the Django book had finally been released after deadline slips (I know they have good reasons but whatever).  ",1195636952
82404,comment,82379,82379,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"That's interesting. But I have some doubts. To some degree our knowledge has to be based not on a deep understanding of the matter itself but on a deep understanding about how to determine who (person or process) we can trust in a particular matter. Or rather how to determine what the right balance of trust versus insight is, given limited resources and the importance of the issue at hand. When I go to hospital, do I take a microscope to see if there's some superbug lurking in a corner, or do I look for a reliable source of information about which hospitals have lower rates of hospital acquired infections?<p>Also, I wonder how we could regenerate something like the information we get from our bank about a particular loan contract or other financial instrument. Sometimes facts are created out of thin air and there is no way to derive them from anything. Sure, I can try to understand what kind of business model lies behind loans and what would therefore be within the range of plausibility, but that wouldn't allow me to calculate my repayments for next year.",1195636694

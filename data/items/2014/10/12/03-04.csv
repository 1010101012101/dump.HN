What exactly do you propose Twitter do?<p>Twitter is not a real-space police force and in many cases does not have true-identity information.<p>It&#x27;s possible that a faster move against threat-originators, through action like a ban on their Twitter account, would do one or both of (1) escalating their misguided anger; or (2) limiting evidence-gathering by real authorities.<p>Also, note that new Twitter sign-ups are very easy. That&#x27;s a policy which overall provides benefits to Twitter and many Twitter users, especially newbies. But it means that it&#x27;s trivial for griefers to circumvent simplistic account bans. So it may be better that they keep abusing via the one account, which collects evidence and can be blocked/muted by reputation, than they burn through the namespace with short-lived throwaway accounts.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like managing antibiotic resistance with bacterial diseases. Sure, if you have a killer formula, deploy it and fix the problem. But if all you&#x27;ve got are incremental amelioration and escalation mechanisms, you need to use those very carefully to avoid training-up even worse malevolence.

Why cling to a name that is--perhaps wrongfully--heavily associated with vicious misogyny in the public perception? At best, that&#x27;s terrible PR. Even the most polite and level-headed Gamergate fans seem to spend far more energy defending the Gamergate name than they do attacking actual corruption.

You may be right<p>C does not refuse to let you cast from a non-pointer to a pointer either, though. It just forces you to be slightly more devious in this case:<p><pre><code>    return *(int **)&x;\n</code></pre>\nThough I think the implicit conversions that force some of these contortions (e.g. &quot;(int *)(int)x&quot; compiles, but does not return an integer pointer with the address equal to the bit pattern of &quot;x&quot; interpreted as an integer, but the integer portion of the float reinterpreted as a pointer) are more convincing demonstration that C is not typeless in a meaningful way in my opinion, as they also mean identical statements will give different results depending on the types of the variables.",1413085930

8444287,comment,8444022,8444188,0,0,acdha,,,"Here&#x27;s the problem: #gamergate started as part of a harassment campaign against Zoe Quinn, closely following a round of attacks on Anita Sarkeesian[1] by many of the same people. The journalism bit was a valid issue latter adopted as a shield against criticism from the attacks at those women, several journalists and anyone else who spoke up against the abuse. Then they jumped in bed with the Breitbart crew, who were never particularly fond of gamers in the past but love free attention and attacks on feminists and other perceived enemies.<p>Things like the image you linked to were invented well after the shitstorm was in full swing as part of that distraction campaign, as were the hundreds of fake accounts registered on Twitter, etc. in the last couple months which use very similar language and pictures to either make attacks or deliver excuses or historical revisionism – amusingly, often trying both from the same account as in e.g. <a href=""https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/521117712844468224"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/521117712844468224</a>.<p>There&#x27;s simply no way to recover from the tainted roots of that movement.

Everything about the experience could feel the same with the exception being control over your data is shifted from a third party to you.<p>One possible solution would be to establish computational governance.

I think it&#x27;s dangerous to publicly and unashamedly discuss how to build a broken system like this, because it reduces the cost of performing that design in the future.<p>For example, if you run an online service, you should spend your time building a system that makes it impossible to spy on your users, not writing an internal procedure that describes how you would spy on your users if someone forced you to.<p>That said, I think the best argument against escrow for those who trust the FBI is that it will chill innovation and free speech, and push consumers and businesses to purchase from companies that don&#x27;t do escrow (because they&#x27;re outside the jurisdiction of whoever does it).",1413085178

Firstly, the form of the message has nothing whatsoever to do with the validity of the message.  I could say &quot;Joe is an asshole and a thief&quot; or &quot;Joe is a man who exhibits nothing but condescension and lack of consideration towards others.  He is also known for his lack of respect for property ownership rights and has been known to, at times, take other&#x27;s property and use it as his own.&quot;.  Both true.  Both deliver pretty much the same message.  One is VERY efficient.  The other one could be an attempt to sound erudite and pseudo intellectual.<p>I go for brevity and clarity.  I am not concerned with what people think about the form of the message.  In fact, it says a lot about a person when they can discuss the merits of an idea without judging the form that stands in front of them.  A homeless man in dirty clothes can utter just as valid a statement as a Wall Street millionaire in a $2,000 suit.  The bigot is the one who is only interested in having a discussion with the $2,000 suit.<p>Go back and read my very first comment on this thread.  This one:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8440555"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8440555</a><p>Now, pray tell, what about that post &quot;repels others from joining&quot; my side?<p>Instead I got an immediate stream of attacks from people who didn&#x27;t bother to go over to Google and type:\n&quot;effects of repealing the 55 mile per hour speed limit&quot;<p>and find articles such as this one:<p><a href=""http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/speed-doesnt-kill-repeal-55mph-speed-limit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/speed-doesn...</a><p>And, of course, the article another HN poster found:<p><a href=""http://www.motorists.org/speed-limits/55-mph-study.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motorists.org/speed-limits/55-mph-study.pdf</a><p>And, of course a bunch of FLAWED articles with opposing views.<p>And so, my post would have been a trigger for learning.  Rather than me hand-picking links that only support my view of the universe it is left up to the reader to do a little work and try to understand where I may have been coming from.  I mean, we are arguing over typing half a dozen words into Google and spending some time reading.<p>Instead these people prefer to immediately down-vote, post a bunch of one sided flawed links and, to use a term from another thread, pour hot flaming oil on the messenger.  I call these people morons.  And rightly so.  I mean, in one case the poster listed a bunch of links and then admits:<p>&quot;raising speed limits increases the rate of road fatalities, at least on highways that are not designed with the features of the Interstate Highway System highways&quot;<p>Really?  Really?  C&#x27;mon.  Look, I&#x27;m not a kid.  I probably have 30 years on the average HN member.  Please give me the benefit of the doubt when I say that a segment of our youth has lost touch with reality in a measurable way.  Everything has to be spoon fed.  Nobody wants to work for anything.  Everyone is a genius.  Nobody wants to get their hands dirty.  Respect is an almost non-existing commodity.  And critical thinking, well, we are far more likely to find Elvis in the building than solid critical thinking skills in the average population of 20-somethings, college or not.<p>So, yes, want to debate me?  No problem.  Go do the research and come back with trustworthy data --not nonsense-- and we can discuss the merits of my position at length with civility.  I will NOT do the work for you.  I, in principle, REFUSE to do that.<p>In this particular case I lived through the relevant period and was very familiar with all the arguments of the time.  So I didn&#x27;t pull my statements out of my anus.  As verified by a bunch of links you can discover yourself, this happened (the insane political claims about raising the speed limit) and as early as a couple of years later they were all shown to be not a little wrong but monumentally insanely wrong.<p>So yes, what I said was, as far as I remember, absolutely factual.  It just so happened it did not align with the post-diaper sensibilities of the 20-something HN crowd who only know about attacking the messenger and are obviously too fucking lazy to take just a few minutes to learn something before flapping their jaws.  I am not saying this is you.  I am saying this is &quot;them&quot;, whoever &quot;them&quot; might be.<p>If you are interested in discussing the topic from a frame of reference where you have done the research to learn and come back to me with questions or objections I would be honored to do so.  My life has been about constant learning.  Nothing better than learning something new.  Having an intelligent discussion with someone who is informed and not spewing nonsense is a fantastic way to learn.  In fact, I engage in this all the time in real life by participating in a range of meetups from technology to business.  Always neat to interact with people who are there to learn an not to put people down because of what they look like, who they are, how they say things, etc.",1413083199

Instead he says that we should not let people decide them, and instead use a uniformly random distribution of passwords (i.e. generated automatically).",1413083001

This &quot;illegal assault rifle&quot; was likely only cosmetically different than a completely legal rifle.  Hell, that rifle is probably legal in most of the other 50 states.<p>And who cares about a bullet proof vest?  Or are those illegal in CA?<p>The guy certainly isn&#x27;t a saint, but holy crap this is a great example of the gov&#x27;t punishing someone using confusing laws against victimless crimes when they can&#x27;t nail him for what he&#x27;s actually doing because it&#x27;s legal.",1413082937

While I&#x27;m adding a tiny little bit of typing to it these days, it&#x27;s only to distinguish &quot;must be a Ruby object&quot; from &quot;can be anything&quot;.<p>You can get away with no type information for surprisingly much. The main hassle is dealing with layout of structured data, but even then it&#x27;s relatively straight-forward to deal with through a combination of memory and documentation (but maybe it&#x27;s the assembly programmer in me - my first compiler was written in m68k assembly and then gradually translated into inline assembly in the language the compiler was for)<p>That core is not by any means a fully fledged usable language, though, which BCPL of course was/is. Martin Richards, the creator of BCPL even still has a web page for it that includes a BCPL distribution [2] with both examples and the compiler.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hokstad.com/compiler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hokstad.com/compiler</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mr10/BCPL.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mr10/BCPL.html</a>",1413082922

Having to lug around your phone pulling up randomly generated strings from an RNG on both ends... defeats the point. Instead of an RNG seed, have a shared secret.<p>Of course, you need a trusted party for that, but that is how oauth and friends work. And how Persona should have worked. Logging in to <i>anything</i> should be clicking login and everything happening behind the scenes, because you are already trusted and authenticated by a dozen other services that whomever you are trying to access should defer to to identify you.<p>At least that is what Persona was supposed to do, and then fell flat due to slow adoption. But it was a chicken and egg problem through and through - nobody would use an immature Persona, and Mozilla abandoned it before it had time to shine.<p>Oauth is the maimed cripple of what should solve all of this, but at least it gets the correct UX to end users most of the time, even it if means wading through a half a dozen login buttons from various services selling your identity.<p>Considering modern browsers all support synced data stores, why the hell is there not some standards pushing api a la webrtc (in scope and adoption) to get randomly generated unique id keys made browser side for each service you use, that you can then sync between devices and across your browser &quot;account&quot;? Persona was meant to become that, but it died. Where is the successor?",1413082858

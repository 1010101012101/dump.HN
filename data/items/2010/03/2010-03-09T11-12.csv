It works, but there are plenty of times that I feel I'd be more productive if I were working in a rented cube somewhere.<p>I think that I've adapted by becoming more nocturnal - my son goes to bed at 7 PM, I go to bed at 4-6 AM, which gives me a full ""work night"". The internet is quieter, the house is quiet, the phones aren't ringing - it's just me, my code, and my headphones for a good long chunk of time. If that doesn't work for you, getting out of the house could be a good thing.",1268135982

1178017,comment,1174714,1177267,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"This model seems flawed:<p>1. The government can increase spending, but they can't create money. Either they get it from taxes, or they get it from devaluing the currency (i.e. taxing holders of currency, or currency-denominated assets). How would it help to take $1 away from an employer building widgets, and use it to hire a Diversity Coordinator at the DMV?<p>2. What's the long-term effect on business decisions if the only two modes the economy is in are a) growth, or b) near-zero interest rates? It looks like this would lead to lots of leverage.<p>3. You're assuming that it's always better for someone to have a job than to lose it. So you'd end up subsidizing candlestick makers (probably by taxing light bulb factory owners).<p>At best, this philosophy merely gives everyone a reason to misbehave. At worst, it fines the productive, growing parts of the economy, in order to reward the unproductive, shrinking parts of the economy. America in the 1930's. Japan in the 1990's. How many lost decades will it take to discredit this stuff?",1268135702

I think the difference here (you are similar to me, in some ways, but I prefer working ""normal"" hours at home) is that you (we) appreciate being able to work from home and invest the time and energy into making it work as well as possible for the client / company.<p>That the employees in this post aren't doing that - or aren't perceived to be doing that - is worrying.

1178001,comment,1176200,1176200,0,0,duck,,,"I think this article is on the right track, but rather than it being a generation thing it is what a person is made of. I see two types of people - those that want to do things themselves vs those that would rather pay for someone to do it. The trend is more people of the later and it is scary if you think about it. As the quality of workmanship goes down, those skills don't get passed on (like framing a house, or working on a car) and then in the end you are stuff with inferior work. A good example would be changing the oil in your car - most of the time it is cheaper and of course faster to have it done, yet by losing that skill (maybe desire is the better word) you are now relying on some old kid who doesn't care one bit about your car. It isn't just the ""handyman"" though, it can apply to everything from cooking to writing software.",1268134638
1178000,comment,1177708,1177708,0,0,grayrest,,,"Do not write your own library from scratch. It sounds a whole lot easier than it is since most of the work in writing the library isn't the actual code writing but rather getting it tested and debugged in all the variants of all the browsers. Use a library.<p>As for which library, they provide mostly the same functionalty at the bottom but differ in the high level feature set and how they're organized. My take:<p>* jQuery - Most popular, best for 'ajax sprinkes' apps but less great for full-on applications<p>* prototype - Prototype hacking outside of ES5 feature backfilling is evil<p>* mootools - The community cares a lot about their visuals but I got burned with a number of bugs caused by them taking shortcuts for size. This was 4 years ago so the kinks are probably worked out, but there are other options so meh.<p>* yui3 - My favorite. Built around a selector api, fine grained module system, custom event based, and the UI layer is very much about progressive enhancement. The downside is that there's not a lot of community support.<p>* sproutcore - the absolute best data layer, UI layer wants to own the page<p>* dojo/yui2/closure - I don't like these because I think they're too heavy or too much like java<p>My specific problem with jQuery is that every app over 1k lines or so tends to go spaghetti. The module/event systems in dojo and yui and the data binding in sproutcore guides you to a more modular system which makes for a more pleasant application building experience. There isn't really a technical reason you couldn't do it with jQuery but I've never run across an elegant, modular jQuery codebase. If anybody has one, I'd love to see how it's structured.",1268134554

1177983,comment,1177623,1177623,0,0,AngryParsley,,,"The studies most favorable to Shenk's position put the heritability of IQ at around 0.5. That is, parents account for 50% of their descendant's IQ variance. Environmental factors would account for the other half. More recent meta-studies (<a href=""http://www18.homepage.villanova.edu/diego.fernandezduque/Teaching/PhysiologicalPsychology/zCurrDir4200/CurrDirGeneticsTraits.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www18.homepage.villanova.edu/diego.fernandezduque/Tea...</a> for instance) put IQ heritability at around 0.8.<p>Even if the studies most favorable to Shenk are correct, the best way to be smart is still to choose your parents. Parents determine genes and a large amount of environment, which together are the largest influences on intelligence.<p>This is a bit off-topic, but I want to point out a distinction that is often overlooked. Heritability is not quite the same as genes. Genes definitely influence intelligence. If you could edit someone's genes, you could quite easily make them very sharp or very dumb. Scientists have identified individual genes and groups of genes that drastically influence intelligence. Down's syndrome is an obvious one. Single genes affecting intelligence include GDI1 (<a href=""http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/11/21/2567"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/11/21/2567</a>) and ALDH5A1 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde_dehydrogenase_5_family,_member_A1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde_dehydrogenase_5_family...</a>). There are others that cause problems such as autism and schizophrenia.

Instead of disregarding the evidence, they should acknowledge it while stressing a caveat: Intelligence, to be useful, <i>must be used effectively</i>. The smartest person in the world might not be best-suited to solve a problem; similar to how the strongest person in the world might not be the best fighter.",1268133215

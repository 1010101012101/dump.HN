6927213,comment,6926150,6926150,1,0,icodestuff,,,"So I read the actual publication[1], and it appears to be mostly a lot of conjecture, at best. The only actual risk assessment is in the appendix and matches the linked article. The 10% number cited by the article is the risk that this happens within 10 years using those numbers. However even the paper notes that the odds are time-invariant. This is quite unrealistic (which the paper fails to note) given that the geopolitical landscape has changed so much since the sample data used in the risk analysis. Instead we are asked to believe that US-Russian relations have not drastically changed since the sample data was taken. Indeed, &quot;It also assumes that the ex- perience of the first 50 years of deterrence can be extended into the future.&quot; Given that the last sample point was 1984, this is, to put it mildly, ludicrous. It&#x27;s more realistic to say that between 1945 and 1991 the risk of a Cuban Missile Crisis-type crisis causing a nuclear war was 6.5%<i>33%</i>10-50% per year, and since then it&#x27;s been 0, than it is to say that (as of 2013) it&#x27;s 3/(2013-1945)<i>33%</i>10-50% per year, let alone that it&#x27;s .19-99% per year that the publication asserts.<p>Similarly, the author laments reduced public interest in disarmament because the perceived risk has gone down, but has done nothing at all to show that the perceived risk does not correlate with actual risk!<p>So what&#x27;s the takeaway? It looks to me like the call for an in-depth risk analysis is warranted, but that the author is using sensational, cherry-picked, and unrealistic data to try to bolster support for it.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.nuclearrisk.org/paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nuclearrisk.org/paper.pdf</a>",1387370780

Perhaps &quot;non-trivial&quot; just means &quot;complex enough to be leaky&quot;, rendering the whole thing a tautology.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about different philosophies behind abstraction for a while. My ideas are a little unformed, but I think they&#x27;re still useful. Basically, as I see it, there are two different ways to define abstractions.<p>There&#x27;s the usual way: you come up with a new notion that has additional capabilities. The abstraction <i>adds</i> to the underlying concept. Perhaps it also hides some detail, but the main action is <i>adding</i>. Some of the leaky abstractions from the post really fit this: TCP, for example, adds new capabilities and behavior over the underlying protocol; C++ strings add a bunch of string-specific capabilities over char arrays; NFS adds filesystem capabilities to a network connection.<p>These abstractions are largely &quot;leaky&quot; because what they add does not always map nicely to what&#x27;s underneath. They&#x27;re also interesting because each abstraction only fits <i>one</i> thing--TCP is just for network communication, C++ strings are just text in char arrays and so on. Ultimately, all these abstractions are just more structure over whatever they&#x27;re based on. Again, the key idea is <i>adding</i>.<p>The other sort of abstraction is what I think of as &quot;algebraic&quot; or &quot;Haskelly&quot;. Instead of <i>adding</i>, these abstractions <i>take away</i>. They expose some feature of the underlying concept and throw everything else away. A monoid, for example, just exposes an associative operation from whatever set (or type) it&#x27;s defined over. It can&#x27;t really be &quot;leaky&quot; (at least in the same way) because it&#x27;s showing what&#x27;s already there. The normal sort of abstraction is like a structure built on top of a foundation; this sort of abstraction is like a lens or a view into a property of its foundation.<p>A very important result is that these abstractions are very independent of any basis or use-case. Monoids come up <i>everywhere</i>. Strings form a monoid. Numbers form a monoid (in many different ways, even!). Booleans form a monoid. Certain classes of functions form monoids. Note how I said &quot;form&quot;: even if we ignored it, the monoidal structure would still be there. Talking about these things as monoids doesn&#x27;t add anything but just highlights something already present.<p>Instead of adding capabilities to the underlying object, this sort of abstraction instead exposes structure shared by otherwise distinct objects. Monoids represent things you can combine; groups represent things that are somehow symmetric; rings represent things that are sort of like numbers; fields represent things that are really quite a bit like numbers; F-algebras represent things that are like any of the other abstractions I&#x27;ve listed (meta-abstraction!); functors represent things that can be transformed while preserving structure and so on.<p>These abstractions also let us talk about different things uniformly and generically. We can reason about and write code against these abstractions without worrying about any particular underlying object. By doing this, nothing <i>but</i> the abstracted structure can do anything--details of any given thing can&#x27;t leak through because we have to be generically compatible with <i>every</i> instance of the abstraction.<p>Functors are a great example of this. If we wrote code using lists, we could do all sorts of things: always return an empty list, add elements to the end, drop elements from the front, change the order... If we wrote a code just using a <i>functor</i>, it would still work for lists but all we&#x27;d be able to do is map a function over the elements. Nothing else. Always returning an empty lists wouldn&#x27;t even be a meaningful construct! Clearly, using this abstraction has taken away our capabilities, but it turns out this is often a good thing.<p>But this is where &quot;non-trivial&quot; comes to bite us. Are any of the abstractions I listed actually &quot;non-trivial&quot;? I&#x27;m not sure I could claim that. To be generally applicable, all of them have as little structure as possible. Ideally, you want to limit your capabilities as much as possible to express whatever you care about. This usually means limiting them <i>a lot</i>. All of the things I listed can be expressed as a handful of functions and a handful of algebraic laws--a few lines of description is enough to understand them <i>completely</i>. They are nowhere <i>close</i> to something like TCP!<p>Ultimately, I am not even sure it really makes sense to compare the two sorts of abstractions. But they are certainly both approaches to <i>abstracting</i>, albeit in different ways. It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s worth thinking about the next time you have to design or use an abstraction yourself.",1387369903

All of a sudden I have to start worrying about what is going on behind that interface so that I can use the interface in an optimal way.  And once you have to start worrying about what is behind the interface, you&#x27;re in leaky interface territory.<p>Here&#x27;s my favourite example - allocators.  Is my memory manager smart enough to detect that I&#x27;m allocating and disallocating a bunch of buffers of the same size, and will decide to keep some in cache for me?  Can it see that I am doing a lot of allocs and frees from one thread, so it uses a special non-thread allocator for these allocs?  These can be big wins in performance, and I can&#x27;t leave them on the table.<p>Some allocators do these things, but there is generally no way of knowing just by looking at the API. So you have to start hoping that the documentation explains what is being done behind the scenes, or that you have the source code, or be prepared to do some performance tests.<p>Here&#x27;s another example where an API works hard to hide a performance leak - OpenGL.  Internally most OpenGL ES implementations hold texture buffers in a tiled format.  This allows the GPU to copy the texture to the screen at a similar speed, no matter the orientation of the texture.  If this wasn&#x27;t done, you would get massive differences in performance if you rotate a texture by 90 degrees, due to memory paging issues.  But with tiling this is not the case, performance is nearly constant.  But this type of sensitivity to performance-based abstraction leakage is rare (and indeed creates another leak - you now need to be aware that there are potentially two copies of your texture in the system - the one you write into and the one that is actually being used by the GPU).<p>In my opinion it is nearly impossible to create an abstraction that doesn&#x27;t leak implementation information.  This is not to say that abstractions are worthless, but just to highlight that abstractions need to anticipate this and provide the tools to make dealing with the consequences a bit easier.",1387369626

Also our radar, missile detection, and anti-missile systems are much more advanced than any other nation.<p>Yes, Iran might nuke Israel, but they know for a fact that the United States will spare not expense invading them and kill everyone responsible for the attack and many more.<p>North Korea main reason for acquiring nuclear weapons seems to be as a deterrent against invasion. You don&#x27;t invade a country with nuclear capabilities unless you take out the nukes first, it&#x27;s just too risky for your ground troops.<p>This is an image of an old Peacekeeper missile with multiple warheads. This missile has since been retired but still leaves me in awe.\n<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Peacekeep...</a><p>It would be a huge mistake for any country to launch a nuclear missile towards a foreign city. The world (mainly the US) would jump on them and whoever ordered that nuke would be dead very quickly.<p>The big problem with nuclear bombs is ensuring our borders and ensuring customs does a good job. A nuclear bomb has the problem of not leaving any trace or signature. How would you investigate it? There wouldn&#x27;t be anything to investigate except where that plane or cargo ship came from.<p>If a plane from North Korea explodes with a nuclear bomb on it, then would we even be able to tell which plane exploded? The entire airport would be vaporized.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know how it hasn&#x27;t happened already. People want to get rid of the NSA but maybe they&#x27;re the only agency actually preventing this scenario by tracking most nuclear bombs. I can&#x27;t imagine that all incoming cargo is screened sufficiently before it arrives in the US, it would truly be devastating for this to happen, all imports would be immediately halted. Maybe cargo ships or ports that export have some sort of device to detect nuclear weapons (I&#x27;m not sure how easy the are to detect).",1387368240

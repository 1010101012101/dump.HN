Most issues I&#x27;ve read about happened when the systems either weren&#x27;t engaged properly or automatically disengaged because their operating parameters weren&#x27;t met anymore, suddenly forcing the pilots to take control.<p>Example Air France 447, where (presumably) the airspeed sensors where blocked by ice, which lead to the autopilot to disengage. There is also the theory that the pilots then made some of their mistakes based on the belief that the avionics would stop them from bringing the plane in an unsafe state and didn&#x27;t realize that the system wasn&#x27;t able to do so with missing information. (I hope I&#x27;m presenting this correctly, but that&#x27;s what I remember reading afterwards)<p>There is also the training aspect: if a system takes care of something 99,9% of the time, the pilot is less experienced in the 0,1% where it doesn&#x27;t. There is a reason the safest airline pilots often fly way smaller aircraft as a hobby and get some instinct for manual flying there.",1444866759

That unique token is sent with <i>every request</i> the browser sends to FB, even requests you don&#x27;t initiate directly.<p>These hidden requests happen all the time, like when a web developer embeds a FB like button on a page. The like button is actually generated and served by FB&#x27;s servers (check your browser&#x27;s dev console), and the request to show the button itself gets that cookie sent along with it regardless of whether you press it.<p>The tricky bit is that &quot;logging out&quot; might not actually be enough. I don&#x27;t use FB so can&#x27;t say for sure, but it is certainly possible to implement &quot;log out&quot; such that you can&#x27;t see restricted resources or pages, but still have an identifying cookie on your machine.

If you&#x27;re using Mobile Safari (or many other mobile browsers), and you double-tap something, it&#x27;s interpreted as meaning &quot;zoom in to this element&quot;. This is useful for pages with narrow columns and things on the sides, etc.<p>However, in order to implement this, when you do a <i>single</i> tap, the browser has to wait to make sure that you don&#x27;t do a double-tap. So there&#x27;s a 350ms delay while it&#x27;s waiting on your second tap, before delivering a single-tap event, e.g. to click on a link.<p>There&#x27;s a meta tag you can use to disable user control of the zoom level, e.g. with pinch-to-zoom. One of the things that this disables is the double-tap behavior. Given that double-tap is disabled on those websites, there&#x27;s no need to sit around waiting for a second tap; you can treat it as a single tap immediately. This change removes the delay.<p>(People are upset because this is an incentive to use that meta tag if you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t need it, and being able to zoom on a mobile browser is useful.)",1444863719

This involves the opposite of regular investing, selling high first, then buying low later. To do this, you borrow the stock of someone else, with an agreement to pay them the stock back at a later date. You sell it straight away, then when the time comes to return the stock to the lender, when hopefully the stock price has gone down, you buy it back form the stock market, and give it back to the lender.<p>The lender of the stock usually gets some fee for lending it to you. They benefit, since they are just holding onto stock for the long term anyway.<p>Naked short selling is when you don't make an agreement to borrow the stock in the first place.<p>The losses you can receive from shorting stock can be huge, is the stock you sold goes up by a lot.",1276520168

They then develop many of the same tendencies of the <i>nouveau riche</i> in developed countries, namely, having no clue how to wisely build wealth and instead buying things that they think give them status among their peers.<p>It's not a big jump from there to not feeling bad about just outright tricking foreigners out of their money. They've already been dehumanized, and are incomprehensibly rich anyway.

However, the study showed that the impacts for reusable nappies are\nhighly dependent on the way they are laundered.\nWashing the nappies in fuller loads or line-drying them outdoors all the time (ignoring\nUK climatic conditions for the purposes of illustration) was found to reduce this figure\nby 16 per cent. Combining three of the beneficial scenarios (washing nappies in a\nfuller load, outdoor line drying all of the time, and reusing nappies on a second child)\nwould lower the global warming impact by 40 per cent from the baseline scenario, or\nsome 200kg of carbon dioxide equivalents over the two and a half years, equal to\ndriving a car approximately 1,000 km.</i><p>FWIW we buy compostable disposables to limit landfill impact (contrary to another comment landfill area is not infinite) and bought our ""real"" nappies on ebay and have then reused them.

CSS is great for its intended use of styling marked up text documents; as soon as you try to do anything that falls outside of that zone, such as implementing a contemporary website layout & design, you end up working <i>against</i> the language. It works, but it's a lot like inferring that Brainfuck must be a good programming language because it's Turing complete.<p>Yes, we have SVG, canvas, etc., but they aren't supported widely enough. Even if you ignore that and focus on the browsers with the best (X)HTML+SVG support, do the layout & design using SVG and the typesetting with HTML/CSS, the resulting markup and CSS aren't pretty at all - again, SVG is good for vector art, not laying out interactive pages.<p>Canvas is generic enough to do pretty much anything, but it's very low level. It's like the X server - you still need all the toolkit infrastructure on top to get anything done in most cases. This is fine for animations, games, etc. of course.<p>So yes, this particular animation could have been better implemented using SVG or canvas. Sure, it's <i>interesting</i> doing it with CSS3, but the sad thing is that it's more than that: the weird hacks required aren't far removed from the ones you <i>need</i> to use in practice, because the 'right' way you mention currently doesn't exist for the vast majority of what we do on the web.<p>It's more than a cool hack - it's a demonstration (intentional or not) that it's 2010 and we're still fighting our presentation languages.",1276518864

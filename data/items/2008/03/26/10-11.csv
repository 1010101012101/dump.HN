A businness type, with just an idea, without any hackers, or capital to implement it, is just day dreaming.\nAnd it is annoying when they think they deserve more than half of the company just b/c of that idea....   If they were providing more than that, capital, connections, userbase, community or something significant, then yes that idea is more than just an idea, but more of a practical plan.<p>But in all this tech parties I have been, and I keep meeting this ""wantreprenours"", that are just a ""coder"" away from getting their startup off the ground, if they only could find a coder....   good luck.<p>They come across with a douchebag types, with a sense of superiority as they think they know businness better than you,   but yet are pretty oblivious on what it takes to get something off the ground.  They learn few keywords such as Ajax, Ruby on Rails, PHP, and quite often they hugely undersestimate the effort it takes (development wise) to build something they want,  which is very annoying to programmers.<p>Just go to any 2.0 parties, and you will meet these annoying wankers all the time, with exceptions of course,   as not everybody is annoying, or oblivious, but a lot are.<p>Ps. In college, a lot of the businnes majors were in social frats, which tend to be disliked from academic/smart types.   Plus businnes school is not a big deal.  A CS major can easily go to MBA and be good at it, will the reverse is very rare.  At my CS programm, during the second semester, we had a class that was kinda hard, which weeded out the people that were not capable to handle it, or were there for the wrong reasons (money, as it was the .com boom then).  Ah, and a lot of these failed CS majors ended up either in businnes, or ""information techonology"", which was half businnes.  So, there you go, more reasons not to like business types.",1206529142

Many of the suggestions in the article are context-specific, or have widely varied appeal depending on the person (I am not going to show up early and have herbal tea, sorry...)<p>But I am going to rehearse.  Many, many times.  Not just prepare, mind you, but _rehearse_.  With a small tape recorder going, I will practice, analyze, revise and practice some more.<p>I think this is the one thing that separates those who come off as professional from those that come off as amateurish.",1206529032

146739,comment,145582,145943,0,0,Tichy,,,"You think both are false, or Hollywood is brainwashing, just not for American values?<p>I am under the impression that for example the theme ""sacrifice yourself for the common good"" is pushed excessively in Hollywood, and I consider it to be brainwashing and American-valueish. In any case, most movies have a kind of moral they want to force upon their viewers. Another common theme is adultery, where cheaters make valid ""shock effect victims"" (ie if somebody has to die, at least make it the cheater, he is not such a big loss for society).",1206528923

146737,comment,146604,146712,0,0,murrayh,,,"It is irrelevant whether or not obscurity is the only kind of protection available; obscurity is temporary and only needs to be defeated once. Furthermore, obscurity is not the only kind of security there is: Benevolent moderation is another form of protecting a community. And even if obscurity was the only kind of security available, we could simply invent a new kind of security.<p>I am unaware of any websites that have ""died"". I assume you refer to the digg.com and reddit.com exoduses that are so often brought up. Comparing those two sites to Hacker News is not comparing apples to apples. The commercial purpose of those sites is to sell advertisement space to advertisers, so trading a small group of thinkers in favor of a large group of more advertisement friendly users makes commercial sense. Hacker News, on the other hand, probably has the commercial purpose of driving business to YCombinator. It is in Hacker News' best interest to keep the small group of thinkers in favour of the larger population. So there is good reason to believe that Hacker News will be able to overcome these growing pains and be a community for the thinkers for awhile yet.",1206528560
146736,comment,146680,146694,0,0,Tichy,,,"""Because implementing an Idea is most of the time harder than having an Idea""<p>I think the difficulty is not in the hacking skills, though. Therefore it seems to me the arrogance of hackers is unwarranted. While I have a science degree, I taught myself programming with a couple of books - it really is not a secret superpower that should make the rest of mankind bow down before me. It is a skill like any other.<p>Personally, I would be delighted to meet a business person who is dedicated to making an idea a reality.<p>There might be an issue of trust: typically, business people are perceived as the people who screw things up and make life bad for the programmers. Therefore, just bumping into a random business person, a hackers enthusiasm might be limited.<p>Another thing that sucks about hacker arrogance: most hackers really only want to work on their own ideas. That makes finding co-founders very difficult. Last year I really tried to meet eligible candidates (ie on barcamps), but even though I met a few capable people whom I also liked, finding common ideas and visions was too unlikely in the end. Of course, I myself am no exception, I would also prefer to work on my own ideas. I try to be open for other ideas, but still.",1206528541

When you consider the name is 'Hacker News' it's surprising it hasn't been swamped already with spam and adolescent comments. Perhaps a high quality community forum like this has a limited life span.

And there should be comments weighting too, because we wouldn't want new users to game the system with each other and thus game again the weighting system for the story order.<p>""Quality"" could be expressed as ""experience"" because obviously people adapted in the climate of YC.news who behave the expected way, as you say you expect to happen and thus the problem correct it self. But expecting the situation to correct it self may not be the right way.<p>Expected way though shouldn't be mean is the correct way, because the community would remain closed instead of being open.<p>So, because of the problems that arise with a weighting system making it probably not democratic, the most correct way for weighting would be to happen in manual down voting, which should appear only for ""experienced users"".<p>Weighting should happen there, so for example if you have 1 experienced user up voting and another one down voting, their vote is eliminated, which positive/negative difference could be used in two ways:<p>1. added in the current points of the story<p>2. or a non-linear scale be used that would determine the quality of the story.<p>what do you think?",1206527122

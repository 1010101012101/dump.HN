It turns out, there is no &quot;rule&quot; as to what the distributor&#x27;s cut should be. Any margin is possible!

10411942,comment,10411348,10411492,0,0,vardump,,,"> I try to refrain from purely negative commentary on articles, but yuck! How can one hope to say anything useful about &quot;memory performance&quot; without once using the terms &quot;latency&quot; or &quot;bandwidth&quot;?<p>Yeah, it is pretty clear the author didn&#x27;t really understand much of the topic. Even if you have lightning fast memory, there&#x27;s still the issue of connecting it. Long traces and multiple levels of multiplexing are going to add latency no matter how amazing memory tech is being employed. Before long, to increase bandwidth, memory needs to be integrated in the same package as the CPU if not on the same die. At least large eDRAM-style &#x27;caches&#x27;. You can&#x27;t economically run 1024 traces just for memory on the mainboard PCB!<p>> The key is figuring out how to write software that takes advantage of spatial locality and available bandwidth rather than getting choked by the latency. This is hard in the same way that taking advantage of multiple cores is hard: it requires a different approach, but is not a fundamental limitation.<p>Indeed, of course this requires skilled labor for now, until compilers catch up one day. And unfortunately code that truly requires random access is just not going to perform well on modern hardware. Up until early nineties, memory was faster than processors. Random access was just fine. Not so anymore.<p>It&#x27;s also easy to get bandwidth limited with SSE and AVX. Although line fill etc. buffers seem to often bottleneck first per CPU core. For scalar code, being bandwidth limited is not going to happen.<p>The issue nowadays is that machines are so unique snowflakes performance and configuration wise. It&#x27;s not hard to max out a single configuration, but it is hard to write something that performs decently across different system configurations. There are like 30 instruction set extensions for x86, variations in reorder buffer depth, variations in cache latency, size and associativity. And of course memory bus configurations, number and interleaving of memory channels, NUMA, DRAM memory page size (1, 2, 4 kB), etc.<p>For example unlike 8-way associative L2 cache on Sandy Bridge, Haswell, etc., on Skylake it is now 4-way instead. Code that is optimised for 8-way L2 cache might be pathologically invalidating L2 cache lines on Skylake.<p>Those aspects matter, because high performance is often a balancing act between available features, bandwidth and CPU power.",1445247447

It was even discussed on HN back then.<p>Most of the NYC subway signaling technology is relay-based from the 1950s, so it&#x27;s not quite a century old.  Those lever machines at West 4th St shown by Business Insider are rare; almost everything is electrical.[2] The 1950s technology from General Railway Signal is quite good; it&#x27;s just high-maintenance. Here&#x27;s a 1950s era panel, running automatically and unattended during off peak hours.[3]<p>That technology really is quite good. All vital relays are open in the stop condition.  All broken wires result in red signals. This is a basic design principle of classic railroad signaling.  The mechanism for stopping trains[2] is brutally simple; a steel train stop comes up at red signals which, if a train tries to pass it, will be hit by a valve lever on each subway car which will directly trip the air brakes.  The position of those levers is monitored by circuits which insure that there are always train stops in the up position between trains.  If a train stop lever won&#x27;t go up (ice, mechanical breakage, somebody or something holding it down) the previous train stop won&#x27;t go down, maintaining protection, and signals will be forced red until the problem is fixed.<p>One reason it hasn&#x27;t been replaced is that the newer technologies don&#x27;t have as good a track record.  The old stuff is very rugged, and is known to survive dirt, ice, snow, vandalism, traction power, vibration, rocks, water, and idiots.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gothamist.com/2015/07/28/subway_steampunk_video.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gothamist.com/2015/07/28/subway_steampunk_video.php</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://nycsubway.org/wiki/Subway_Signals:_Train_Stops"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nycsubway.org/wiki/Subway_Signals:_Train_Stops</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RStJ621auaU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RStJ621auaU</a>",1445246237

The kind of writing you can find in some blogs popular among certain people who publish writings in favor of &quot;reason&quot; but whose reason or curiosity does not extend to the workings of actual people. They are either blind to the strong irrational forces motivating them, or aware and afraid of them and wish to be rid of them, as &quot;reason&quot; (at least their interpretation of it) is something that they feel they can cope with. They then propose solutions to solve society&#x27;s problems provided that society was made of point-mass people and somehow displayed tractable dynamics. I call this kind of writing &quot;spherical-cow sociology&quot;. What these people really want is a recognition of their own abilities and their own rise to power, something they feel they&#x27;ve been unjustly denied and rightfully deserve. This is a modern manifestation of the comic-book heroes of the 1930s-&#x27;60s, all created by people who felt powerless. Unlike those comic-book writers, the contributions of the contemporary group are questionable, as the models of society they come up with serve their own particular psychological needs and lack the mass-appeal of Superman.<p>2. The kind of writing popular in the 1920s and &#x27;30s by social Darwinists who actually were curious about real people and knowledgeable about the workings of society, but were seeking moral justification for their continued subjugation of others. These were people who were already in power (i.e. they felt sufficiently empowered), but felt pangs of guilt regarding their treatment of others, which they wanted to sweep away.<p>The giveaway is the laser-focused emphasis on intelligence and material benefits, simplified-ad-absurdum models that appeal to the limited thought of those in the first group, and the suggestion of eugenics, a popular choice among those in the second.",1445245201

However, another factor is that the total number of actual flights is a subset of all flights, the main filter being weather and mechanical problems.

I wonder how the risk changes further if you delayed your driving as much as airlines delay their flights?",1378731562

What does Borlaug have to do with fossil fuel usage. The link you gave does not make this connection at all, and neither does the Wikipedia article. How Borlaug could have fed these these people without using fossil fuels and how did he advocate fossil fuels specifically as a technology?<p><i>Whenever you substitute another gene &quot;part&quot; into an organism, you lose your net output of energy</i><p>Organisms get their energy from the sun through photosynthesis. It has nothing to do with their genes.<p><i>The entire point of sexual reproduction is to make it so there is as much diversity in the genome as possible. This makes it so one bacteria or virus can&#x27;t unlock the genome of an entire species and wipe it all out.</i><p><i>I think this also explains the last piece. We&#x27;re exposed to a virus getting the code for a specific piece of that gene and wiping out all of that system very rapidly.</i><p>Sounds like the case you are making is that there is a higher risk of losing the whole yield at once.<p>While that may be true, what you are describing is a risk. Considering that GMO plants make considerably more yield, the farmer has to weigh the risks and benefits. This is common to for all businesses. GMO yield would be more expensive than non-GMO yields if the risks were too high. Farmers aren&#x27;t stupid.",1378731524

Her comment, &quot;GM employed hundreds of thousands, Facebook fewer than 10,000&quot;, while  may be factually correct, is a function of how Facebook chooses to organize its business, rather than a true reflection of the jobs it created.<p>GM liked to control all parts of their value chain - GM parts (I.e. Delco Electronics), GM service centers, even GM financial services.<p>Facebook&#x27;s strategy is more akin to owning the toll roads, and letting other people build the cars. Hence, Facebook doesn&#x27;t provide social media management services, app development, or FB media buying - external businesses do.<p>Therefore - comparing the two businesses directly in terms of job creation is not comparing apples to apples - there ARE hundreds of thousands of people employed in businesses directly related to Facebook&#x27;s existence, they just aren&#x27;t directly on the FB payroll.<p>Granted, while I feel this specific critique doesn&#x27;t necessarily significantly weakens her overall thesis, her usage of comparisons like this one makes me cautious of accepting her other examples I am less familiar with at face value.",1378731183

6352986,comment,6351914,6352436,1,0,VLM,,,"One interesting thing about SSDs that you probably don&#x27;t know about because you self declare as not being a SSD guy, is many (most?) of plain flash memory cards (camera cards, etc) sold non-retail aka ebay, CL, etc have their bios modified to report a larger amount of memory than they actually have.  So you pay for and buy a &quot;16 GB&quot; SD from some guy on CL and its actually a 4 GB modified to report its a 16.  It actually works until you try to put more than 4 GB on it.  If you buy from a reputable dealer, at least if you get ripped off it&#x27;ll probably be easy to swap.<p>I strongly suspect a similar market will shortly exist for aged out SSD.  Once a SSD dies, simply modify its bios to report its brand new and error free, and sell it at full price on CL / ebay / etc.<p>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever heard a report of this kind of behavior in old fashioned rotating rust hard drives.  Then again the major manufacturers all have some story or another about shipping broken garbage fresh from the factory, they don&#x27;t need additional crooks to rip off the endusers.<p>One &quot;obvious&quot; startup idea is no one who knows anything about RAID ever voluntarily builds an array with identical models / sequential serial numbers.  However that is the only way big integrators will ship servers.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to eat a modest fee (aka a profit for a startup) for someone, somehow, to help me end up with an array of extremely non-identical drives.  I have no idea how to work this.  A swap operation?  A trading site?<p>Maybe if you assume you want to replace an entire array every X years, and you&#x27;ve got Y drives, a subscription service sends you (Y/X) &quot;currently top of the line&quot; drives per year and you swap them in and expand the array as possible, as now unused space becomes available?  There&#x27;s subscription services for everything from &quot;fruit of the month&quot; to &quot;mens underwear&quot; so I think there&#x27;s a possibility for raid admins to subscribe and save a new drive every 3 months or whatever, and due to labor costs of failure, businesses are not going to flip out at a somewhat higher profit margin.  The killer problem with a subscription startup service like this would be customer support handing turnover at the enduser aka mailing address, and publicity.  This service might exist, or existed in the past, but I&#x27;ve been in the biz a long time and never heard of it, so I find that highly unlikely unless the one attempt years ago was an epic fail.  Aside from big biz, at least some small admins would subscribe, so don&#x27;t forget about us guys with TB scale mythtv installations at home.  I mirror and would like a yearly replacement cycle (because I have the dough and don&#x27;t enjoy recovery as a hobby) so send me a top of the line big SATA every six months for 10%, do all the research (maybe burn-in testing) to save me the time, and I&#x27;ll not blink at a &quot;modest&quot; markup, say under 100%.",1378729362

The Australian Labor Party was defeated by the Coalition, an alliance led by the other major political party in Australia - the Liberal Party.

As an adult you might think, oh, well he can use Skype or e-mail then, and what&#x27;s so bad about making new friends. No. Eventually most of them stop making friends, or make them very superficially. Your kids most likely won&#x27;t have childhood friends, friends they trust, nor close friends. And no, family (or you) is not a substitute either.<p>> sacrificing the safety & comfort of a normal life and just doing what it takes to make something happen<p>That&#x27;s great as long as it&#x27;s only your stuff you&#x27;re sacrificing.<p>I do commend the bravery and spirit, but I&#x27;m strongly against including kids in it.",1378728003

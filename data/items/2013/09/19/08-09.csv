And since everyone wants to be a game developer, that means your salary is less than in other types of compsci jobs.<p>So, that culture stuff you&#x27;re speaking of?  It&#x27;s bullshit.  Ultimately it&#x27;s a method of getting you to do the bidding of others.  It&#x27;s not about you at all.  No one is looking out for you, and while you may feel like you&#x27;re part of a team, that team has no loyalty to you.  If you stop performing at peak level for even a couple months then your prospects will be severely harmed.<p>Employees get to feel proud they&#x27;ve literally sacrificed part of their life to help someone else succeed.  And you&#x27;re supporting pervasive lawbreaking in the name of &quot;that&#x27;s just what it takes&quot;!<p>If game companies are finding it hard to recruit talent, well, that&#x27;s probably because people are finally wise to their ways.  You won&#x27;t find anyone who was more in love with the idea of being a game developer than I was, but the reality of the industry is abhorrent.  The shared culture has utterly decimated any hope of work-life balance in the gamedev industry in the US.  My options were to work elsewhere or to move overseas.  And by working elsewhere I get more cash, get to work on problems that are more interesting, <i>and</i> I learn more.<p>European developers seem to have figured out how to develop next-gen games without any of the bullshit methods of control you&#x27;ve described.

The difference between apple and microsoft products, in my humble opinion is that Apple gives you an experience (however over-priced it may be) while microsoft gives you a product. People tend to remember pleasant experiences for a long time. I don&#x27;t remember if I ever used a microsoft product that completely blown me away. With Apple I have, several times. The only reason I don&#x27;t use any recent apple product anymore (except for my three year old macbook) because I seriously dislike their walled garden approach.<p>I agree with you on the point if Apple can continue to innovate in a post-jobs world. Its hard to say yet and I am not yet convinced with their recent products. Another problem with Apple is that they depend too much on few key people.<p>On the other hand Microsoft will die a slow death because one of their key market, desktop OS, is soon becoming irrelevant; as people are moving to mobile devices like tablets. And MSFT doesn&#x27;t have a strong foothold in this market yet. I don&#x27;t know much about MSFT enterprise market though. But I would guess they were able to be so dominant in enterprise market because of their strong position in desktop market. Will this still be true in the future? I don&#x27;t know.",1379580856

Suppose I flip a coin, and choose an envelope at random.  Without opening it, suppose I designate the value it holds as Z.  Now I know with probability 50% that the other envelope contains Z/2, and with 50% the other envelope contains 2Z.<p><pre><code>  > For example I have a 5c coin, a 10c and a 20c coin.

It&#x27;s completely different because I seem to know what all the options were for what you did and the amounts involved.<p><pre><code>  > If your knowledge of the system commences with &quot;here are 2 cups&quot;\n  > you have no extra information -- you only have 2 amounts.  The\n  > higher and the lower. You will pick the higher one 50% of the time\n  > on the first go, and 50% of the time if you switch.\n</code></pre>\nYes.  So now, without lifting the cup, let&#x27;s consider some statistics.  Let&#x27;s call the unknown amount under the cup I&#x27;ve chosen Z.  The other cup must contain Z/2 (with probably 50%, as you say) or 2Z (also with probability 50%).  If I switch, my expected return is then 5Z/4, which is larger than Z.  Hence, if given the option, I should switch, <i>even though I don&#x27;t know what the amount is that I&#x27;ve chosen.</i><p>That is the paradox, which you still appear not to have resolved.",1379580354

I know it&#x27;s not very well defined, but given a Turing complete language, there <i>is</i> a proof that a given program is the shortest of its equivalence class if it is.<p>I said &quot;simplest&quot;, not &quot;easy to grasp for a human brain&quot;, or even &quot;simple&quot;.  It&#x27;s just that &quot;poof magic we have simple mathematical rules on which the universe runs&quot; is a simpler hypothesis than anything else I have heard from (such as the God Hypothesis). There&#x27;s also a certain elegance in positing that <i>every</i> set of mathematical rules are actualized.  That way, we don&#x27;t have to pick a <i>particular</i> rule, making the master program even simpler.<p>On Quantum Mechanics, okay, I guess you&#x27;re right.  Just remember that while amplitudes are out there in the world, <i>probabilities</i> are in the mind.<p>Do you think plausible that we could, in principle, find a mathematical model that perfectly describes the universe? To me, the answer is obviously &quot;yes&quot;, even though I&#x27;m not certain that we could find this model <i>in practice</i>.  Now, assuming our universe does run on math, it is quite impossible to test for different kinds of ontological existence. Do we live in a simulation?  If the simulation isn&#x27;t buggy, we don&#x27;t stand a chance at root escalation, and we can&#x27;t tell.  Does the mathematical rules exist, like &quot;poof magic&quot;, or do they need some exterior force or entity to be actualized? Again, we can&#x27;t tell, because there&#x27;s just no way out of our universe.<p>> <i>For example, we might expect things to be constructed from pure Platonic solids, we might expect the subatomic realm to be less fuzzy, etc.</i><p>Maybe not. The actual laws of physics may be even simpler than that, despite the complexity that arise from them.  We&#x27;ll see when we find them.  Occam&#x27;s razor doesn&#x27;t favour surface simplicity, it favours simplicity at the deepest level.<p>> <i>The fact that something is not surprising is not evidence.</i><p>Indeed. It is <i>prior information</i>, which is just as important as evidence.  Without prior information, you don&#x27;t stand a chance at interpreting evidence.  Data can&#x27;t speak for itself.<p>> <i>To be more likely to believe something that seems unsurprising to you implies that you&#x27;re choosing beliefs based on personal bias.</i><p>Or, it could mean that I tailor my surprise to my actual probability of the thing being true, based on the information I have.  Heck, I have emotions, I might as well use them.  By the way, didn&#x27;t you notice that you&#x27;re not surprised all the time?  That emotion isn&#x27;t as irrational as a Straw Vulcan would believe.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;personal bias&quot; you speak of, but there&#x27;s no escaping the fact that different people have access to different prior information. They will inevitably make different probability estimates, even if they are perfect Bayesians.<p>You should read <i>Probability Theory: The Logic of Science</i>.

If you can afford to buy a new phone every year then you probably don&#x27;t care very much about CM. That still leaves a big chunk of the population who can benefit from CM: an 8 million strong installed base is pretty impressive for an Android distribution that usually requires you to void the warranty on your phone.",1379578840

In my office, thankfully, there is a norm that you only go to ask another person after you&#x27;ve looked through the documentation and attempted to understand the code or error message yourself. I don&#x27;t mind being interrupted in my current work environment, because I know that 90% of the time, the interruption is a worthwhile one - that there is a non-stupid question for me to answer.<p>I have worked at offices where this norm did not exist. I would strongly challenge your assertion in that case. My productivity definitely <i>was</i> adversely affected. What I think a lot of people lose sight of is that interruptions are additive. If you get interrupted once or twice, that&#x27;s fine. You can recover and get on with whatever you&#x27;re working on. But if the interruptions are a regular feature (especially when they&#x27;re for little things that take two to five minutes to solve, but require you to drop all your current context) it takes longer and longer to recover. At some point (usually around lunchtime in my case) I&#x27;d just give up and hop on IRC or Hacker News, knowing that it was unlikely I&#x27;d get much work done that day.<p>It got to the point where I&#x27;d come in at 6:30am and leave at 3:30pm just so that I could have a few hours of uninterrupted coding time at the beginning of the day. And this was in an office where it was just other developers I had to deal with. I would probably last less than a week in an office that I had to share with non-developers (especially sales, who have to be constantly on the phone).",1379578781

One of the main reasons why I spent 1/10th the time yet scored the same as my classmates was maps. I would practically convert each chapter into a map, and merely crawling though a map was more than sufficient for any kind of a revision.<p>In our industry maps make wonderful testing tools. Lets say you want to test X, write down a map of each functionality, then write down further nodes, which basically is what could possible go wrong or right with each node(Each of this becomes a separate node). For each node you expand, stress the node bring out more test nodes until you can&#x27;t stress any node anymore.<p>The resultant map will be nearly the best test cases you can come up with.<p>Now do this before you start coding, and what you will get is all the scenarios you need to handle to make the code bug free.<p>Additional tip, avoid using map software. Best tools for this kind of work are paper/pen or whiteboard/marker.<p>I&#x27;ve been using this strategy to write C code for embedded systems. And it works like a charm.",1379578762

Suppose you&#x27;re running RAID-1 with two drives, and you&#x27;ve got some filesystem (maybe ext4, but that doesn&#x27;t matter) running on top of that.  You create one huge file, and then a little while later you delete it.

Even with modern drives, that leaves a large window of time that you&#x27;re not protected.<p>If, on the other hand, your RAID layer has a thicker interface to the filesystem than just a dumb block store, it can just mirror the little bit of metadata, and within seconds you&#x27;re in sync again and fully protected.<p>That&#x27;s just one example.

Looking at the alumni of the accelerator I went through, the successful companies (eg the ones that haven&#x27;t folded yet) have all had at least one non-technical founder.<p>The fact is, this is exactly the sort of question that technical founders struggle with - you want to be coding when the problem you&#x27;re facing is something that requires getting on the phone, going to events, meeting people, and finding either someone who&#x27;ll put in sweat equity or someone who&#x27;ll put in cash based on your vision alone.<p>My advice would be to cut down what you want to build to the minimum, build a demo, and take it to people who might buy based on that alone, and try to raise some angel cash at the same time if possible. But with an angel who knows your market and can put in time as that non-technical business-side person.",1379577612

You can&#x27;t sue yourself, so to even make the case arguable in the US, you&#x27;d have to set up the contract such that Microsoft would initiate legal process against the customer, requesting a declaratory judgement that they would not be liable for damages for searching the customer&#x27;s data.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any case law on this, so the first thing the courts would have to do is figure out if they even have jurisdiction to handle such a novel claim. The answer to that could vary between different states&#x27; courts and between state and federal courts. (And might even vary between federal courts, since federal cases borrow a lot from state laws, both from the state they sit in, and from other relevant states, like the state in which an entity is incorporated, or the state a contract was executed in.)<p>(And even if you get past all that, you haven&#x27;t actually stopped Microsoft from doing anything at all. They can still search your data without going to court in the first place if they&#x27;re willing to risk being held liable for damages for breach of contract. Those damages would not likely amount to much.)",1395374290

7440532,comment,7435720,7436374,2,0,einhverfr,,,"BSD/GPL compatibility is a complex issue.<p>Here&#x27;s my take.  The 2/3 clause BSD licenses are clearly compatible with the GPL v2 because they offer a strict superset of rights.  I.e. they don&#x27;t offer any restrictions not found in the GPL v2.  Consequently the work as a whole can be licensed under the GPL v2 without worrying about whether any piece of it has additional permissions which satisfy the license.<p>The GPL v3 however provides some real reasons for caution here.  The additional permission section is clearly compatible with the MIT license, but is clearly incompatible, as it stands, with the BSD license which does not explicitly grant sublicensing rights (meaning you can&#x27;t relicense someone else&#x27;s BSD code under the GPL without their permission).  So you can&#x27;t include BSD licensed code and count on the additional permissions section as protecting you.  (This is based on my discussions with Richard Fontana and other lawyers involved in free software issues.)<p>The question then becomes whether section 7(b) legal notices can be read broadly enough to include the BSD license.  I.e. the author of the BSD licensed code is merely giving notice that all users have the permission, directly from him, to use the code as allowed under the BSD license.  This is not an additional permission under the GPL, but an additional permission directly from the author, and notice is merely being preserved.<p>If this is the case, then the GPL v3 is compatible with BSD licenses which do not have an obnoxious advertising clause.  But if it is not, and if all additional permissions must be removable even in the absence of software modification, then they are <i>incompatible.</i>",1395373440

7440530,comment,7440305,7440305,39,0,dperfect,,,"Many people are expressing surprise by the events that have unfolded here with Mark Karpeles and Mt. Gox, but I&#x27;m not surprised in the least.<p>I&#x27;ve known several web developer &quot;enthusiasts&quot; over the years who know just enough PHP (usually it&#x27;s PHP, but this applies to other technologies as well) to build things that <i>mostly work</i> and feel confident that they can solve anything with &quot;a little PHP.&quot; Working mostly alone, these people prefer to spend their time building constantly, and little time learning or keeping up with current best practices (or in this case, cryptography).<p>There are a large number of companies (many of them doing very well) built by people like this, and even when they bring on other developers, no one has the courage to tell the original developer (who is often CEO) that their code sucks and needs to be scrapped completely. They keep throwing more crap onto the pile because the machine &quot;works&quot; and customers are demanding new features. The original (incompetent) developer feels a sense of pride for his or her work, and nothing short of <i>total failure</i> (in this case, spectacular failure) will convince them that their work is anything less than genius.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that some companies thrive in situations like this (it sets them up for failure), but it happens all the time.<p>I don&#x27;t know Mark personally, but from everything I&#x27;ve read from him over the years, he seems to fit the description above. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean he&#x27;s a terrible person or a thief (he could be that as well, but I have no knowledge to prove one way or the other). It just means he got in over his head, and kept the site running on deeply flawed assumptions and implementations (e.g., no standard accounting, little understanding of security, etc). It&#x27;s a shame that people kept coming back to Mt. Gox and entrusted the site with their money, even after those behind Mt. Gox proved themselves to be incompetent <i>over and over again</i>.<p>Is it sad? Yes. Is it surprising? The only surprising thing is how people <i>kept going back</i>.<p>As for the missing and suddenly reappearing coins, I honestly think they just had absolutely no idea where everything was. I&#x27;ve heard people describe Mt. Gox&#x27;s infrastructure as a hodgepodge of random scripts and servers duct-taped together, and it&#x27;s easy to imagine a dozen hard drives filled with an unorganized mess of Bitcoin wallets, private keys, database dumps, etc. I believe they&#x27;re honestly trying to pick up the pieces, but the pieces are scattered everywhere.",1395373401

7440506,comment,7436401,7440344,1,0,eevee,,,"The announcement post says the actual type-checking happens in a persistent server that watches for filesystem changes.  That sounds pretty close to continuously running a linter.  It also says &quot;without breaking things&quot;, so I&#x27;m a little fuzzy on whether badly-typed code will actually execute or not.<p>For that matter, can you call a typed function from an untyped one?  Or, worse, a typed method?  If the typing is purely static, there&#x27;s no way to know the method you&#x27;re calling is actually typed, so there&#x27;s no actual guarantee that it receives the types it&#x27;s declared unless your entire program is typed.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like a very strong guarantee if both the caller and the callee have to opt into the typing.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a tool that exists right now, you either have an existing codebase and can&#x27;t port it to Hack if it&#x27;s not already PHP anyway (for the same reason Facebook couldn&#x27;t port away from PHP), or you&#x27;re starting from nothing and could just use a statically-typed language in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d even be excited about the prospect of optional static typing in Python.  (It hasn&#x27;t gotten me interested in Dart, for example.)  I&#x27;d kinda rather see the effort poured into something that could do static duck-typed analysis/inference, e.g. balk if I pass an argument that could be a non-string into a function that tries to call `.startswith` on it.  (Ah, but maybe it could theoretically be a string <i>or</i> None, and I only know it isn&#x27;t None for reasons the type system can&#x27;t see, and now I hate the type system.)<p>I didn&#x27;t say it was a trivial problem.  I just don&#x27;t feel excited by the solution.",1395372826

Whether some company building a webapp has a problem with the AGPL, I generally don&#x27;t care; that goes in the same category of two companies disagreeing over whether a proposed license fee is too high, business details.<p>As an example of why organization is required: in states which don&#x27;t ban it, companies are generally able to insert non-compete clauses into employment contracts. This is because individual employees signing employment contracts usually have a mixture of too little individual market power, and too little legal knowledge. The only real way to do away with noncompetes, despite <i>very</i> wide agreement that they&#x27;re bad, is to either: 1) organize into a union that negotiates better contract terms on your behalf (done in some fields and countries, not in American tech); or 2) pass laws that ban the onerous terms entirely (what California did with noncompetes).

7440433,comment,7435720,7440288,1,0,_delirium,,,"> SunOS/Solaris vs the free BSDs?<p>This actually seems like a counter-example: the commercial spinoffs have totally dominated in comparison to the free BSDs, which have never had particularly large market share. Through much of the 1980s and early 1990s the free BSDs had approximately zero users, whereas their commercial spinoffs had hundreds of thousands! The BSD licensing also allowed AT&T to reincorporate large chunks of the BSD code back into AT&T Unix (even Microsoft borrowed some of the sockets code for Windows). This situation was only disrupted in the 1990s by GNU and Linux, not by the free BSDs, which re-arrived only later. And even as Solaris declined, the free BSDs didn&#x27;t manage to capitalize and gain its market share.<p>On the desktop, of course, a proprietary spinoff of the free BSDs completely obliterates the usage numbers of FreeBSD and PC-BSD: Mac OS X. It&#x27;s not a pure spinoff; it also includes permissively licensed code from the CMU Mach project, among others. And it&#x27;s at least semi-proprietary: Apple does release some code, but it&#x27;s both incomplete and doesn&#x27;t even build, so there is no free version of Darwin you can actually run.",1395371607

7440405,comment,7386114,7387283,1,0,jonyu,,,"Agreed with michael.<p>To the OP: life will provide you with plenty of experiences.  You don&#x27;t need to look for problems because they are masqueraded as inefficiencies and frustrations.  When you notice yourself frustrated, ask: why am I frustrated?  What is frustrating?  How can things be improved?  Coming up with ideas is a creative process.<p>Creativity is a muscle that can be trained.  A simple exercise is to take, say, a pencil and name as many uses for it as possible.  That&#x27;s not useful in reality as it&#x27;s not directly related to a problem.  You could, alternatively, find a problem, such as an itchy back or uneven desk legs, and think of ways to use the pencil.  Thinking of using the pencil is easy.  What&#x27;s very hard is you have to remember the pencil, keeping it in the subsurface of your mind as you encounter problems.  Of course, this is a grossly simplified example, but this is how problem solving works: by observing situations, remembering the attributes/qualities of objects (or resources) and appropriately recalling them when they can be a possible solution to the problem you are facing.  Most people brainstorm the first way.  They look for what they want to do, and find ways to make it work.  Like michael mentioned, it is nice if you are doing something for fun, but it is not good for generating viable business ideas.  The best business ideas are organic, as in they come from a real problem.  People are usually happy to pay to make a problem go away, provided the solution improves their lives in some tangible way.<p>I would argue that the second way of brainstorming - the indirect way - is more powerful because you are training yourself to add constraints by tracking existing resources and recognizing when they are useful in a seemingly random problem with no obvious connection to the object in question.  Back to our example: when you have an itchy back, there is not necessarily a pencil in sight.  You have to pull it into your mind&#x27;s eye.  You are essentially turning your mind into a database or file cabinet; a must-have skill if you want to be a top-notch tech support person or creative problem solver.  This is the secret behind the hype about connecting-the-dots and ideation.  It&#x27;s very easy to talk about, but very, very hard to practice.",1395371099

I misunderstood / recruitment agent mis-told me that it was equity, rather it is a company share option scheme. <p>I will be offered 100 shares (3yr vest period) which isn't great however this will hopefully be pre series A and so strike cost should be a lot less post series A.<p>Is it worth going for share options (even if it's only for 100 shares)? I don't see this as compensation for salary but more of a bonus if anything.<p>what does eveyone think?",1186497020

But there are books (nolo.com has some for instance) that explain the steps necessary.<p>I guess it's all about risks/rewards - I don't have a  lot of assets to begin with, I'm not sure the company will go anywhere, so why blow thousands of dollars on expensive lawyers?  Better to learn the details of the process myself.  So I created an LLC in Oregon.<p>On the other hand, if you're already wealthy, and want to create some kind of music sharing site... well, maybe some good lawyers are worth the money.",1186496697

Our application is in.<p>This faq is certainly a reason for making this post and asking, as our release would come before the winter session starts and maybe before Oct. 11th, when application results come out.<p>Is seems the consensus is to incorporate in some fashion just out of basic prudence before a release. So the question for PG and folks at YC is ""you'd rather we no incorporate, but I think we need to, how should we do it?""<p>Another thread mentioned opening the ""standard"" papers YC uses -- and PG mentioned the problem in papers that might be wrong or have holes for companies. I'd like to hear about any progress on that front.

40065,comment,39939,39939,0,0,rfrey,,,"There have been a number of comments about how effective incorporation is at protecting you from suit, etc.  They're all guesses: Sarbanes Oxley changes all the rules, and the old rules concerning the corporate veil no longer apply.  (Anticipating an objection, no, SarbOx does <i>not</i> apply solely to public companies.)<p>The problem is that nobody knows exactly what the new rules are.  There is no case law yet surrounding SarbOx IT compliance that I'm aware of.  <p>That doesn't really matter, though.  nickb said that not incorporating is ""just dumb"": if that's the case, there are an awful lot of really dumb entrepreneurs out there, and really dumb business advisors, too.  The cost of incorporation is more than the couple of hundred bucks to file the paperwork: there's ongoing compliance which costs both money and mindshare.  It's probably not worth it until you require the different tax regime or have a specific need for the limited liability.<p>The bottom line is that you won't get sued until you have substantial revenue, and then you'll get sued no matter what you do.  Lawsuits follow the money.  Nobody is going to sue you to get your house because it would cost more in legal fees than your house is worth.  A website is different than a business with a storefront, which has to deal with the possibility of personal injury claims, and which invariably has an insurance policy to provide the honeypot for suits.",1186496385

1392296,comment,1389499,1390713,0,0,bartl,,,">But we are drifting into a world where the industry Powers That Be are going to hide everything  behind rental models, and it will no longer be possible to buy an open-ended, use-it-as-you-like version of information products. When they switch the servers off, it's gone. If you move account, it's gone, and you have to pay again on your new service, just like when they went from LPs to tapes to CDs.<p>>I'm not sure that is a healthy direction to move in, but as long as significant numbers insist on breaking the law and ripping off others' hard work, that's the direction that market forces will push.<p>If it comes to that, I can safely predict one thing: piracy will increase enormously.<p>Just, as they said in the blogs comments, like Harry Potter books in electronic are among the most pirated because there are no official Harry Potter ebooks for sale.",1275303566
1392293,comment,1391566,1391566,0,0,rigard,,,"I posted this on the article's comments:<p>Well I can gather two things from this article. 1, the Washington Post is very definitely not involved in the digital advertising industry; 2, the Washington Post does not deal with a decent digital marketing agency.<p>""Lazy"" is a remarkably strong term for many agencies whom, in my experience, often work around the clock to deliver on tight deadlines and low budgets, as clients still do not consider digital as important as above-the-line media. With extreme constraints, some of the most interesting conceptual work tends to come from digital agencies, who are forced to push limits in a constantly changing environment, with high demands from an intelligent user base who are not interested in simplistic and overdone banner advertising (which seems to be the focus of this article!).<p>Innovation is exactly the name of the game when it comes to digital marketing. Take Farfar's tremendously successful campaign for Diesel (<a href=""http://www.farfar.se/awards/cannes2007/heidies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.farfar.se/awards/cannes2007/heidies/</a>), or R/GA's Nike+ campaign, which received numerous awards and incredible ROI (Google it), or Crispin Porter and Refresh Partners' Whopper Sacrifice Facebook campaign for Burger King, that was so successful in its execution that Facebook had to kill the application, or even AKQA's campaign for VW, which relied on nothing but an iPhone app (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=324848336756&ref=mf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=324848336756&r...</a>)<p>These are but a few of the very successful, innovative, forward-thinking digital marketing campaigns and strategies out there, that are so far beyond a simple banner ad and truly identify the kind of industry that digital is all about. The question ""Why is digital advertising so lousy?"" is a useless question, and is simply responded to by the fact that only lousy digital advertising is lousy, very similar to lousy advertising in other types of media. Just think of the pamphlets that are handed out on streets, or left under your car's windscreen wiper, or the terrible infomercials on TV or adverts with bad acting, or big billboards with no thought behind them.",1275303483

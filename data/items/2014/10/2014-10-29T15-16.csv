Having searched around, I&#x27;ve found that Angular (1.2) provides a good balance between structured, easy-to-find-things code, and fewer keystrokes to iterate fast on features. I wish React were like that, but the lack of best practices in the Flux architecture makes it hard to know where to put things - I found I was constantly worrying about shooting myself in the foot when I made architectural decisions in React.<p>I do think that Angular&#x27;s going to get a Python-like version split, and it&#x27;s refreshing that plenty of people are still writing Python 2 libraries... because I&#x27;m not leaving Angular 1.2 any time soon!",1414598236

People should definitely be educated about the privacy consequences of their equipment. I&#x27;m arguing against people who <i>do</i> know that an SSID broadcast is a public radio signal they themselves transmit, and are still arguing that other parties (Google, Mozilla) should be responsible for their privacy regarding that signal instead of themselves.<p>> my point was that we routinely consider things other than protocol specs in determining whether and when signals should be collected.<p>A radio signal that is explicitly meant to be public should be public information. A radio signal that is meant to private, but can be made public by exploitation or specialized instrumentation should not be public information almost all of the time. If the meant-to-be-public signal can be collected en masse by an app such as Mozilla&#x27;s, then there&#x27;s really no way people should feel any expectation of privacy in this regard.",1414598135

The issue is not the rate at which people are getting information; it is the rate at which people are <i>using</i> the information which creates the volatility.<p>My solution is as follows.  When someone places a market order, the order is not cancelable and his funds or security goes into escrow.  Then he must wait for a amount of time, selected at random from some distribution by the market.  For example, he might have to wait 5 minutes; or wait 2 hours.  At that point, the transaction occurs.  The market will clear all transactions before it closes.  The idea is to significantly reduce the advantage people might gain from rapid transactions.  To discourage breaking transactions into many microtransactions for purposes of gaming the distribution, we might also introduce a small per-transaction tax.",1414598015

That&#x27;s the same as saying &quot;we won&#x27;t tell you&quot;. It is understood that not everyone can negotiate the same amount of money but the range is crucial to know. For example, if I want to get paid 150K base salary and the range says 100-120K, I am not going to be bothered any further.<p>- Name of the client/company: Please don&#x27;t play games with this one. Either you tell me the name or I am out. I don&#x27;t wanna hear &quot;Fortune 500 client with great benefits&quot;. really ?<p>- What are they looking for?

I blame hiring managers more on this one. I have got calls saying &quot;we need an excellent C++ developer but donno any further details&quot;. Umm no.<p>- Location: Where will I need to be ?

It&#x27;s pretty convenient to pull out my phone, flash the loyalty card, and wave it over the POS terminal.  I get a little receipt scrolling up the screen and a copy is emailed to me.<p>Now Apple has joined the party and with the two biggest smartphone OSes supporting tap-to-pay (and with implementations that both work on standard POS terminals with NFC) it looked like there would finally be some push to get support from retailers that hadn&#x27;t updated their terminals yet.  Seemed like a win-win.  Both iOS and Android fans would have a convenient and more secure way to pay for things without any of the lock-in or incompatibility that normally comes along when Apple and Google are competing in the same space.<p>...but no.  These guys are taking a page from the carrier playbook and deliberately disabling something that has been working for years just as it&#x27;s gaining popularity outside the early-adopter/techie space.

And rest assured it is not uncommon for you to run into issues when your test suite becomes large.<p>Unfortunately there is no silver bullet to make your tests run faster. I have used both Jenkins and CircleCI and they are great for most environments.<p>To combat this speed issue I have added a timer to all of my individual test runs. In Ruby with rspec, for example, this is relatively simple by just adding --profile to your .rspec file. Every time your test suite is run, this will show the top 10 slowest running tests. Each testing framework has a similar mechanism or add-on which will give you a report. Next start refactoring those long running tests. At first it will seem like a slow processes, but working on it a bit each day will quickly show significant improvement in your testing suite speed.<p>Next, watch out for tests, particularly integration tests and Selenium tests, which either test the framework and not your code, or which are redundant. A number of times I have walked into clients offices and have been told that their test suite is as &quot;tight as it can be&quot; and yet still runs slow. I look through it and find many areas where engineers in their desire to test thoroughly were unfortunately testing areas they don&#x27;t need to. A bit of refactoring again showed massive dividends.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t be afraid to segment your tests to run only portions that are effected by the code that was changed. It&#x27;s true that running the entire suite is important, but you&#x27;re correct in only running the whole thing at certain times. My current project has segments for API, various Front End resources, and service integrations. There are a number of sub segments as well. Again I think of this as a test refactoring exercise, but it will pay off if designed well.<p>So, unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a software solution that will solve your problems. But I can say that a few refactoring activities can make all of the difference.",1414597003

8527712,comment,8527230,8527230,0,0,Bahamut,,,"My thoughts on 2.0 so far - most of 2.0 seems pretty good.  I can deal with AtScript, since it seems like we are forced into transpiling from ES6 to ES5 anyway.  It is dirty that this means we don&#x27;t quite have clean standalone JS libraries that is as easy to use as an ES6 import.  The gains of DI with something like di.js instead of repetitious annoying conventions that pollutes code design is worth it I think.<p>The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the new HTML templating.  I want valid HTML - the one thing that gave Angular a leg up over other frameworks in my eyes is that the templates were purely HTML.  If I wanted to migrate to another framework, it would be much easier to do so from Angular since the templates were pure HTML, so the CSS would still be valid.  It seems like we are forced into a sort of templating system similar to JSX (note: this is a guess on my part - I know the Angular team admires React for the performance of the virtual DOM).  This type of complexity makes it harder for newer developers to get into frontend application development, and it makes me concerned from a management standpoint.<p>I think the main complaint in the article about enterprise support is bleh though.  Very few frontend developers want to support enterprise these days due to how fast the frontend world is evolving.  Due to this fast pace, it&#x27;s important to modernize until the ecosystem is as mature as it needs to be.  The complaint seems to ring hollow since it seems that the author doesn&#x27;t want to have to devote the amount of resources as it takes to develop web applications.  More of the complexity has shifted to the frontend, and so it takes more on the frontend to meet the same expectations (and less on the backend, or focused on more high level tasks)",1414596823

8527579,comment,8524256,8526637,0,0,soylentcola,,,"Slightly off topic here but I still think a large part of that is due to hostility from more traditional content providers.  The promise of GoogleTV (that was mostly squashed before it had a chance to mature) was that it provided a front-end for content on more traditional satellite/cable services as well as for finding all of the free streams available on network websites and newer platforms like Youtube and Vimeo.<p>I think the real disruptive potential of GoogleTV was that it allowed you to search for something and have results from all of these disparate feeds show up in a single list.  It put content from the web (including independent and user-generated content) on par with network programming or programming delivered via the web instead of a cable subscription.<p>When networks blocked GoogleTV from accessing their streams without tinkering with user agent strings, etc. it really put a dent in the whole strategy.  The point was to show you everything that was available on the big screen in your living room.  Networks wanted you to watch on the TV via the more lucrative cable and rental options and only use free web streams as an alternative when you&#x27;re at your computer in the office or the hotel.<p>In this way, current tablet-to-TV options like Chromecast and AppleTV are less disruptive since they don&#x27;t put web content on the same level as cable content.  To watch TV you just flip through the channels.  To watch web stuff you need to connect some device and push content to the TV.  It&#x27;s a small thing but I think it&#x27;s a legitimate difference.  Firing up YouTube to push a video to your TV isn&#x27;t the same as searching for &quot;video games&quot; on your Google/Apple TV and seeing TotalBiscuit come up in the same search results as something from Viacom.",1414595586

Earlier man powered aircraft (SUMPAC, Toucan, Puffin etc.) had been based on glider (sailplane) technology that emphasised the highest possible lift/drag ratio achieved by large span high aspect ratio wings and careful control of the aerofoil shape. The span and aspect ratio make the aircraft complex and comparatively heavy. MacCready realised that if the aircraft was made much simpler and lighter it could fly at a lower speed and although the L/D ratio was poorer (all those bracing wires!) the drag would be lower (V<i></i>2) and the power required (V<i></i>3) much lower, within human range. The quick to fail, quick to rebuild was a consequence of this simplicity.<p>Incidentally the photo showing the &quot;speed ring&quot; is nothing of the sort.

That&#x27;s a very common arrangement where the per-subscriber pricing is very high for few subscribers and drops as more are added.<p>At the limit, the slice of pie pricing is completely continuous and each incremental subscriber lowers the cost for everyone. This one may be coarser grained.<p>Nothing inherently shady or anticompetitive about such a scheme.  It also tends to arise where governments (like SEC, or like county clerk offices) have a dual mission of providing public access while offsetting costs, and need/want to outsource it to a for profit service provider.",1414595167

Just what is still, and was previous of the reboot, the current master of the system, restarted with a wiped data set.<p>In distributed systems this is the process not acting as specified, since Redis processes must reload their dataset on restart, otherwise they break everything, per design.<p>Now if it is a good idea to change this design: in the future yes, but so far we had not diskless replication, so for the replica to synchronize to write on disk was, anyway, needed, so why turn off persistence, and why to support it if the disk is needed anyway?<p>See?

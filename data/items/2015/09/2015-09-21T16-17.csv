Both sides of the issue have their shitshows distorting the debate with harassment and dirty tactics. At its core gamergate is a conflict between cultural authoritarians and libertarians. It is just the beginning of a wider issue, the old guard of the internet, those that believe in freedom of expression without repurcussion vs those who believe that speech on the internet should involve more social responsibility.<p>There is really no reason why they should not co exist. Gamergate is one of the examples however of what happens when both occupy the same space. Those who are afraid of their space changing vs those who refuse to occupy such spaces.<p>There&#x27;s nothing stopping either ideals staying within their own space or creating their own, however the internet is a pressure cooker that inevitavly leads to a game of escalation and one up mansship where no compromise is accepted.",1442854795

Kind of like mixpanel, except that it understands the concept of a &quot;company&quot;?<p>Most of these tools that I&#x27;ve evaluated (mixpanel, kissmetrics, heap, keen)  seem to provide great reports but have no native concept of a company and the purchase and activity dynamics around them.  So, you end up modeling in companies as individual users, but then you lose the rich dynamics around how people evaluate products.<p>For example, I am looking to create a churn report.  When a company buys a tool, there are often several people involved:  someone who signs up for the product, others who use it, and someone who pays.  They may all be the same people, or not.  They all influence each other in the decision.  The person who makes the purchase often has almost zero utilization of the app, since they are in the finance dept.<p>I&#x27;m looking to setup some sort of analytics that understands and models these users correctly within an account.  I&#x27;d like to run churn and LTV reports on an account level, but still retain activity reports at a user level.<p>Does this exist?",1442854770

A small theatre company or neighborhood block party committee can self organize because the core cadre of a half dozen people take care of the finances, grants, etc. Even in those cases, someone is at least nominally in charge -- an individual needs to sign checks, apply for grants, hold the cash, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve lived this at least a dozen times, in a mid/late stage startup, F500 company, and sprawling government bureaucracy. The story is <i>always</i> the same. New business units emerge with a guy in charge and a nimble team of <10 people. They achieve success and grow. Problems start around 10-15 people because folks are focused and cannot productively communicate across the group. Leaders emerge and work out differences. The next point of resistance in around 25-30 people -- the lack of explicit authority undermines the emergent leaders. Everything breaks at 40-50 people unless there is an established chain of command.<p>There may be a way to tweak these things and make it work, but it takes special skills/knowledge/instincts that aren&#x27;t obvious to people. Special things are hard to repeat, and business relies on repeatable process.<p>IMO, there are a couple of ways that flat orgs can work. The most obvious is where the work is delivering unkilled/skilled tasks. A plumbing company has a dispatcher who sends out plumbers. A consulting company has salesmen called Vice Presidents, Project Managers and dispatchers. No hierarchy.<p>I think the other type of org is a co-op type arrangement.

More notable about Quinn was the disproportionate attention she got from the gaming press despite her limited accomplishments, from journalists such as her financial backer Ben Kuchera of Polygon and her friend Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku.<p><a href=""http://www.deepfreeze.it/article.php?a=unfair"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deepfreeze.it/article.php?a=unfair</a><p>> Hernandez has also promoted two Kickstarters by GaymerX while being on friendly terms with the organization&#x27;s president Toni Rocca and some of the other GaymerX staff.

Now I will concede that I am not entirely knowledgeable about the psychology behind self-victimization, but what it is defined as makes it fairly easy to identify.<p>> The most high profile example of this was Zoe Quinn’s claim that Wizardchan raided and doxxed (acquired and revealed personal info) her. That whole affair is best summed up here. Basically, the takeaway from that is that her accusations hold little if any merit at all. What is consistently seen throughout that is how easily she puts herself forward as a victim and asks for consolation from a variety of personalities and sites.

I have also read about stars being created (e.g., starting a fusion process with all the hydrogen and helium in Jupiter, Saturn, etc.).<p>There is currently no evidence which suggests stars are being moved. We should see either large gravitational tugs or engines such as Shkadov thrusters. The latter should be plainly visible. The former should be easily detected by extrasolar planet detection methods. Unless the tugs are spherical, the light curves of the tugs would definitely pique interest. In any case, moving a star seems a rather extreme and expensive measure. It is probably more effective to consume the star onsite and use the energy locally or send only the energy back.<p>There seems to be no evidence of stars being consumed, either. Dyson spheres (or swarms) have actually been searched for locally by comparing visible and infrared wavelengths over sections of the sky. None have been found. Intergalactic searches have also been done by looking for galaxies which glow too brightly in the far infrared. No luck.<p>It is not just a question of a mistaken belief that the artificial is natural. The properties of light are the same here on Earth as they are billions of light years away. Further, for all those galaxies and stars to be engineered in the same way aross billions of light years (with some points being unable to communicate with others since the Big Bang), is all but impossible. Life would have to evolve at effectively the same rate and come up with the same solutions in all those hundreds of billions of galaxies (and yet somehow be different here in the Milky Way).

I always wondered, how they can claim their engines emit less while they get faster and faster. Everybody knows that a modern car does not consume so much less fuel than a car of then comparable standard 20 years ago.
But lets face it, consumers require more power, less fuel consumption and less emission - in this order. Probably the development of on paper values has been disconnected from the real world for marketing reasons (that is no excuse, its an observation). Before everybody throws stones at Volkswagen only, please measure other cars (again, no excuse).<p>From time to time I rent cars of different brands and at the gas station I see proof that there has been little progress in fuel efficiency. That said, Volkswagen and Audi diesels seem to be the most fuel efficient engines around for the pure power they deliver. The only diesel I know that felt more advanced was a Volvo V60, but mostly because of a geniously constructed gear system and a perfectly rectangular torque (so I had to change gears at 3500 rpm).<p>In Europe (and that means in this case in Germany), car manufacturers invented the fleet consumption and emission. That means, the consumption and emission of a whole class of cars is averaged. This is to trick high powered engines on paper into an acceptable consumption and emission range.
The goal is clearly not transparency and openness.",1442851752

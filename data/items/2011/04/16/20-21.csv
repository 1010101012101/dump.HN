It's confusing to many people, and generally has a style that will quickly appear dated once a well designed alternative gains critical mass.<p>A few years ago, the micro-blogging community was not big enough for a second player. Now it is, and Twitter will change or be overtaken by a more compelling alternative.<p>The simplicity of Twitter was once its strength, but like any technology, it must grow to meet the demands of its users. Facebook added chat, photos, a compelling platform, etc...  Twitter is dead in the water right now.<p>Who wants to remember silly @handles? There isn't even a directory of official Twitter handles for companies.<p>Private group message applications are sprouting up everywhere - Twitter is just plodding along unaware that this is a huge need.<p>Who wants to see hideous bit.ly links instead of actual content?<p>Is 140 characters really the future? I doubt it.<p>Are third party services really necessary to embed media? Do users really need to figure out how to tape together 10 different services and clients to get a good experience?<p>Twitter needs to grow up, or it will die. And it will happen quickly - less than two years from the day a serious competitor gains steam.",1302987561

A dollar is not an arbitrary thing, it fundamentally profoundly <i>is</i> a warrant to discharge a debt obligation against the United States Government. The rest of its value emanates out transitively from that.<p>A BitCoin is fundamentally more arbitrary than a dollar. (At least at the moment. Hypothetically this could change.) Perhaps it will make it anyhow, despite my skepticism, but it is absolutely, empirically true that a dollar is not an arbitrary value store. It has a base case for its value chain. BitCoins do not have this.",1302987265
2454813,comment,2444709,2452569,2,0,fastspring,,,"For those desiring a more complete explanation...<p>Regarding pricing, it's true there are less expensive-appearing services (though don't forget that without SaaSy handling everything for you you'd still have to pay 3.5-4% in e-commerce merchant fees for every order, once you factor in the true costs), but they end up costing you far more when you factor in software development costs and the years you will spend if you go it alone or use an existing basic service that appears to cost less. Remember, it's not just building what you think you need today, it's also adding on to it endlessly as your needs grow and change, and then there's the maintenance. That's just the tech development side, what about dealing with taxes, say in the EU if you have any EU customers, or a dozen other similar issues you'd otherwise be on your own to figure out and then develop a solution for? Take a look at this matrix to see what the cheaper, more basic solutions are missing that SaaSy provides for those launching or running existing SaaS businesses, and you'll see why SaaSy is actually quite a deal relative to the basic recurring billing services:\n<a href=""http://saasy.com/matrix.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://saasy.com/matrix.php</a><p>In addition to saving you all the time, money, and hassle of building your own e-commerce system, the incremental profit you'll earn from utilizing our features for growing your average order size, lifetime value, and optimizing your conversion rate far outweigh the higher fees. Each feature you take advantage of can increase your revenue by a few percent, and it doesn't take too many increases of 2-4% here and there to add up to an overall profit improvement that far outweighs the few extra points that Saasy's all-in-one service costs. For example, cross-selling; upselling; add-ons; bundling; discounts & promotions; order pages in local currencies and languages; Facebook/Twitter referral management; a breadth of payment methods available for your customers; an order page customized to fit the rest of your site or designed to fit your preferences; the ability to test and tweak different order page structures and merchandising ideas; reseller management; analytics; outside help with PPC, SEO, affiliate, and general web marketing; fraud protection, and the list goes on. And then there's the impact our phenomenal customer service will have on your churn rate and the word-of-mouth sales it generates to have so many ""wowed"" end users out there talking up the customer experience of working with you. SaaSy also reduces your internal support expenses as they relate to order and payment customer support, since we handle that for you.<p>If you're up for spending up to a couple of years building and improving on an e-commerce infrastructure, SaaSy isn't for you. But if time to market is important and you'd rather focus on developing your product/service and doing sales and marketing instead of dealing with the distracting complexities of building your own e-commerce system either from scratch or by building all the needed functionality around one of the cheaper, more basic solutions, then you'll want to take a close look at SaaSy.<p>When you view our features list and the competitive matrix, think through the costs of developing your own infrastructure over the next few years vs. what your development team could instead be focusing on, factor in that you're not going to need to pay the 3.5-4% in e-commerce merchant fees for every order which you would be doing otherwise, consider not only the reduced expenses but the new revenue you'll now be able to generate, and you'll start to see why our rates are actually quite a deal, saving you money, helping you to significantly grow your revenue and to thrive relative to your competitors.",1302987263

First, the limited supply means that you've essentially just created an electronic version of gold. It's more easily tradeable, but its behavior as a commodity will be similar.<p>If you like investing in gold, that's great. I guess.<p>Second, bitcoins do not necessarily remove the issue of paying a fee for transactions. Instead of paying a fee per transaction, you will instead pay a fee in order to transform normal currency into bitcoins (this is not as readily apparent now, but if the system ever becomes large enough to actually have stable value, then you will need to pay someone to convert real currency to bitcoins). Will this be cheaper than credit-card fees? Probably? Keep in mind that credit card companies are offering just that: <i>credit</i>, which is a service. Someone has to pay for it (either you, the merchant, or the marketers who they sell your buying profile to).<p>Third, bitcoins ignore the fact that national currencies are an incredibly valuable tool for modern governments. They can of course be misused (see: Argentina, post-WWI Germany), but adjusting the value of your currency is one of few ways of improving your country's competitiveness globally (see: the trouble Ireland, Greece, and other European nations have had recently because they do not have control over the Euro). So, don't expect national currencies to go away, or become obsolete.<p>Perhaps the Bitcoin community has an answer for these concerns...",1302986122

If someone is willing to accept something in exchange for something else, that act reveals that they value it, either for its use value or for its exchange value (i.e., as money).<p>I meant intrinsic value in that context. Of course I agree that it has value based on what people are willing to exchange it for. That's precisely the point I was trying to make; in your original post, you had claimed that bitcoin was flawed because it wasn't based on a commodity originally, and I was pointing out that that really has no bearing on its present value.<p>> Why do you think that? It's certainly true that artificial scarcity raises prices (for money, in terms of all other goods), but that scarcity is not what is being subjectively valued.<p>> A $20 bill today is valued (as money) based on what it could buy yesterday. And yesterday's valuation (as money) was based on the day before that.<p>You trimmed out my next sentence in your quote in which I said almost exactly that. My only point about artificial scarcity is it limits the rate at which value can be lost due to inflation; it helps it retain its value, because you know that someone else won't be able to just go and get more for themselves, but instead will be more likely to want to trade you something for the currency you are trading.<p>> Go back far enough and the money valuation will have spawned from the commodity valuation.<p>It doesn't really matter how far back you look; just because a currency was originally based on a commodity has no bearing on its value now, other than as a historical artifact. What matters is what it will buy you when you spend it, which is in the future, and while not entirely predictable, in the near future tends to be close to what it would buy you in the recent past.<p>All I'm saying is that there is as much intrinsic value to a bitcoin as there is to a dollar, or a euro, or what have you. The difference is mainly in how they are transferred, and how the supply of them is constrained. I'm not entirely convinced that a deflationary currency is a good idea, but I think that bitcoin is a technically, economically, politically, and socially interesting experiment.<p>I generated a few back in the day when I could do so on my laptop in a few hours without dedicated GPUs running constantly, and I'm going to hold onto them for a while to see how this whole thing pans out. Who knows, with only 21M in existence, if this thing takes off the few I have could wind up being pretty valuable later on; and if not, well, I just lost a few hours of CPU time, no big deal.<p>If you don't think that bitcoins will hold their value, I'll gladly take any you have off your hands.

That way, the library author can memoize functions, and so can the library user, if they are sure the function they want is pure (i.e. no side effects).<p>I see problems with allowing callers to memoize methods of an object. You're breaking encapsulation when the caller can suddenly decide how a method is to be cached. In principle, every method of an object depends on the object's private state, which could change at any time. So how are callers supposed to know what is and isn't cacheable? Or when to expire a cache?<p>Also, the average object has methods for writing and reading. It would be pretty silly to allow there to be cacheable writing methods. Again that suggests control over what is cacheable should be in the class.<p>That said, you've got a good idea here -- just figure out how we can give the class control over what is memoized. I am pretty sure this is doable; perhaps you have a private method _get_memoized_methods() that tells the inherited abstract class Memoizable what can be memoized. It can then make it appear as if $object->fastQuery() exists, when it's just a wrapped around the private method $object->slowQuery(). You can do this, I think, by catching missing methods with a __call function in Memoizable, and, I think, you can throw exactly the same exception as PHP would whenever a method that you don't want to mess with is called.",1302985075

Personally, I think the barrier to entry is far too low. Apple opened the floodgates to try and get as many apps in the store as possible, and it worked. But now they're faced with the daunting task of cleaning house.<p>I would love to see them implement a monthly service fee - rather than charging $99/year up front, they should create a couple of price tiers with limits on the number of apps you can submit. That way, if your app isn't selling, you have a good incentive to remove it. They could also charge a smaller percentage as you move up the tiers.<p>As it stands, $99/year is just too easy to justify leaving everything in there - you're bound to get a few downloads from somewhere.",1302984960

Due to the language's similarity to C (or Java), lots of beginners will basically write C in Javascript, use the very basic languages features, put all functions in the window scope, etc., and get away with it. It's enough to get some some working and pretty good-looking (on screen at least) Javascript code. Which is what the author is complaining about  that's not ""knowing"" Javascript.",1302984958

So if the universe is a deterministic automata the 'unsatisfactory dehumanizing implication' stands. \nDespite this, the only way to predict the state of a Conway system n iterations from now is to allow the system to run for n iterations. No one could actually model the universe precisely by creating a cellular automata. The automata would have to contain as much information as the universe, so it couldn't fit within the universe. Also even if the builder did know the system rules and a valid starting condition he could only compute as fast as 1 iteration per iteration of the actual universe...and hence not be able to outpace the universe and predict the future. \nI think solipsist is right about macro vs micro rules. And the macro rules themselves have macro rules ad infinitum. At some point you get to macro rules that try to describe human behavior (which apparently don't work very well). I don't think the cellular automata reductionist approach will help us too much in predicting the future in our universe for reasons mentioned above. We may be better off with macro rules like Newtonian physics and so forth.",1302984925

The entire reason we mention technologies on resumes is because we used them, and (assuming we're not completely desperate) we want to use them again.  The mere fact that you have done <i>anything</i> in a language gives you a foot up on the person who truly has zero exposure to it.  Experience is compounding, and each small step can be worth dramatically more than the last.<p>I've met too many people who believe that in order to list a technology on your resume, you must be an 'expert' in it, where the meaning of 'expert' varies wildly.  These tend to be the same people who think that ""evaluating a prospective hire,"" means, ""find any point of weakness and exploit it.""  It's a weird, insecure defensiveness.

They make some really great innovations, and then lock everyone in to their proprietary ecosystem using the appeal of these innovations.<p>Locking users down doesn't work forever though. iTunes did for a while, with DRM on every song. Finally users were able to pay to get rid of it, as other sources (Amazon MP3) were offering competition. The only way I can see Apple continuing to be so successful with iOS is through continued innovation, not by caving in to developers demands for features---what developer has refused to reach Apples enormous market because they weren't happy with development tools? Something like no garbage collection seems like a small issue when considering the upsides of developing for iOS.

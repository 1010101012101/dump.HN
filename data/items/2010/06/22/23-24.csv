If the work situation is abusive or dysfunctional in some way, again, it's different. You have to show empathy also and look at it from an employer's point of view too: it takes a lot of effort to find somebody, especially find somebody good, and then there's ramp up time on both sides of the fence. As long as both parties make a good faith effort to make it a good situation, it's generally bad form for an employee to quit that early without significant mitigating circumstances in his life (family/health problems, etc.) Not saying you should stay there 10 years, that's too long in this field and economy.<p>Partly it's a judgement thing, and partly comes from perspective gained from past experience. If you ever want to work for somebody else again it will be a black mark against you in many employer's minds, for example -- again, without there being significant relevant negative circumstances at play. Also, unless you're a young adult, all of this would have been knowable at 0 months rather than waiting to the 6 month marker to realize them. So again, if you're a younger adult, it makes more sense and is more excusable. Been there, done that, have the metaphorical t-shirt. :)",1277250200

Stop drinking alcohol. Stop drinking sugary juices. Stop drinking coffee. Just cutting those sugar/carbs will trim a lot of weight off of you. Combine that with exercise and a man will lose weight insanely fast 10 pounds in the first month is not even a problem.<p>As for exercise - do everything that makes you sweat. And I mean fall down, can't breath, can't move sweat. Running, biking, swimming, weight lifting, dancing, rollerblading... whatever. At least 30min - 1hr every day. EVERY DAY. Be consistent. Don't stop.<p>I just did a 2 mile swim in the Hudson river on Saturday and a sprint triathlon on Sunday. This will be my third season training for triathlons. The tri season is just getting underway for me in earnest and my training (swim, bike, run) will considerably pick up. You don't have to do a tri or compete in a run but for me it makes it more 'real' and I get to put events up on my calendar that I know I won't back out of and that I know I have to be ready for. My first half Ironman will be in September.<p>In addition, I do P90X with my sister everyday (according to the schedule). P90X alone is a rock solid regimen that if you stick to will definitely improve your physique. It is very taxing but dead simple to do. Just pop the DVD in and do what the man says. If all you want is an above base level of fitness and a nice body - do P90X. It works, it's hard, it's probably too hard for most programmers who sit around all day reading HN, but it is definitely worth doing and it will definitely get you into shape.

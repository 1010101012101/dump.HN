Both forms of legislation would have a detrimental effect on technological innovations and the economy in America.<p>In this still awful economy that you and your colleagues have done so well to repair, the technology industry continues to boom. Many of the top websites on the internet would be crippled as a result of the proposed legislation, not because they endorse or participate in piracy themselves, but because they provide platforms that make the world open and connected. It is with websites and online platforms such as Reddit, Twitter and Facebook that many Americans learn and better themselves due to effortless accessibility of prosperous and unique information shared among global cultures. Even you, Mrs. Adams, benefited from such platforms. With approximately 2,000 likes/follows on Facebook and Twitter alike, you clearly understand the good in having an open and connected internet environment.<p>I understand that a minority of rich old men in Hollywood with lots of money have realized that they lost there ability to compete, but lets not punish the majority for their inept. If companies wanted to stop piracy, they should take a stand themselves! How? Instead of investing all that money in lobbyist, hire a anti-piracy technology team! For half the price, they could hire a talented team of programmers and developers to safeguard there content from piracy. It's that simple!<p>Fight fire with fire. Pardon the cliche, but in this case technological innovation has acted as a catalyst for piracy. Yet it is technology that will be the only answer towards stopping it as well (unless SOPA and PIPA are passed).<p>I urge you once more, please Congresswoman Adams, vote against SOPA and PIPA.

We shouldn't forget however <i>how</i> they do this: by enforcing scarcity when the default was abundance.  By the way, you can get abundance back by breaking the law.<p>I reject the terms ""property"" and ""theft"" when talking about ideas and recordings because they are abundant by default.  By using those words, they make you think in terms of scarcity.  They skew your perception of the issues, then exploit that bias.  This is why I insist that others do not use the word, ""it's <i>GNU</i>/Linux"" style.  Even if you know what you meant, many people don't, and it has consequences. (In the same vein, I remind people not to say ""internet"" when talking about the world wide web alone.  If you believe you ""have the internet"" as long as you can run a web browser, you won't notice nor protest when your ISP starts blocking TCP ports.)<p>I also reject copyright and patents altogether.  Not because they are not property by default, and therefore illegitimate (I find this argument very weak).  I reject them because I believe they do more evil than good.  Most probably, they are more a hindrance than a help for our economy and our technological development.  Not to mention the inevitable loss of individual liberties, which humans tend to value by themselves.<p>Overall, I believe scarcity should be abolished whenever possible.  If we get to the point where there is so much abundance that life is not <i>fun</i> any more, then we'd have a good reason for scarcity.  (Video games provide an example: god mode, unlimited ammo, and free experience points tend to spoil the game. I'm still tempted by the cheat codes, but I think twice before I type them.)  But right now scarcity is a problem to be solved.  Copyright and patents are part of that problem (or at least a symptom).",1326894268

3479564,comment,3478850,3478850,4,0,kochbeck,,,"What's particularly galling about this post (and the SOPA / PIPA / whatever people on the other side too), is that I haven't found anyone on either side of the argument who's stopped and said, ""Hey, wait! Somebody's getting some major economic benefit from piracy. Let's see who."" Everyone - supporters and detractors alike - are either talking about their own positions (like this guy's) or these nebulous entities like the ""music industry."" (I worked in the ""music industry,"" and I can't define it.)<p>The guy who wrote that is receiving, at best, nominal returns from criminality along with the satisfaction of making the, ""Fuck you, that's why,"" argument. Crime isn't paying well at all for him, because he's committing a potentially life-altering crime in increments of $0.99 in music. So let's just set all those people aside for a moment, because on an individual basis, that's just a wreck to explain. Would take interpretive dance. These sorts of people only matter economically in the aggregate (think: Bittorrent), but ""people-in-the-aggregate"" isn't in charge, doesn't steer anything. Real individual human beings are.<p>So how about some individual human beings who are benefitting mightily from piracy? Somebody must be making out big time. They must have a lot of power and a strong justification for having the system be just so.<p>And if you took a moment to ask, say, the former CTO of any political campaign, they'd tell you who those people are. But since you didn't ask, I'll just tell you: it's politicians. Heard it here first people: political campaigns PIRATE THEIR ASSES OFF. I know with 100% certainty that one of the sponsoring senators for PIPA won big riding on top of a sea of pirated software in their campaign office. You betcha. One of the sponsors.<p>In the last decade, when money into campaigns has increased by orders of magnitude, piracy has actually increased on campaigns, many of which can now afford to pay. Why? Laptops. Back when desktops were still king, odds were good that you'd have one or two legal copies of, say, Office that you were installing across all the machines in your phone banks, another couple copies for your volunteer centers, maybe one for your staff offices... all those places where fixed machines were. So at least you were installing at like 5:1. Not legal, but not crazy.<p>But that's not how it works anymore. Now everybody plays BYOL. Need Office? Sure, there's a copy on Bob's shared drive. Need MapInfo? That's on a fileserver. And everybody at a machine (and I mean everybody) needs basic commercial software to work. Some need even more - the Adobe Suite or Visio or MapInfo or... it just goes on and on. Copies of SPSS floating around. If it's a campaign for an incumbent, you need, at minimum, everything on your desktop in the campaign that the staff on the Hill have, because you're going to be passing lots of files. So incumbents' campaigns tend to get right into piracy real fast, because they need application parity with their official staff.<p>Multiply that by every staffer and every intern and every volunteer who brings in their laptop and that's a huge number of copies. A successful presidential campaign is probably pirating on the order of at least 3,000+ copies of just Office alone. Seriously. Go audit Romney. They're there.<p>Funny thing is, it was the artists(!) who ultimately cracked down on the rights management firms that made campaigns stop pirating music. Possibly the one time ASCAP and BMI actually did anything for the artists, and it was against politicians. The deal was, artists were tired of politicians they didn't agree with playing uncleared, public performances of their music. If they hated the guy, they sure didn't want him to also get the music for free. So the rights firms cracked down. Odds are, big campaigns now have a CD of cleared music with usually BMI. They don't do it till they think they're likely to get caught, so they STILL PIRATE THE DAMN MUSIC. But eventually they make good. Want to check that one out? Call the compliance desk at the folding Cain campaign and ask if you can see their BMI clearances. Bet they don't have any - they bowed out too soon to get caught.<p>Oh, oh! Don't forget TV. A good rapid response operation is capturing all the news in areas in play and all the advertising for themselves and their opponents. Nowadays, there are firms that suck it down, and then they take the files and share them around the office. Much like Pirate Bay in the TV section. ""Hey, did you see yesterday's AC360 on the other guy? Here's a copy!"" Back when I was doing this crap, TiVo was still pretty much the best you could do on short notice, so I had a shelf of hacked TiVos. Ah, how life has gotten easier.<p>One more thing. Lists. Copyrighted lists. Mailing lists. Demo data. All the information detritus from campaigning. Stealing lists is a serious no-no. Reason being, the way politicians get rich (if they don't start rich, of course) is their list: because your campaign is not a shareholder-based corporation, the candidate ends up owning the assets. The key asset that gets created is the supporter list. A good list from a very successful national single run can bring in millions. Even for the loser.<p>So lists are precious. You'd think that somehow there would be an honor code around this, at least. ""Thou shalt not screw thy coworkers out of their primary asset."" That would, unfortunately, be untrue. Go ask any campaign data manager how they've ""salted"" their list. They'll tell you. They hide tripwire data in the list - emails that go to warning scripts or phone numbers that forward to their own cell. Because pirating each other's data in politics is also a national tradition.<p>A few things, some of them quite complex, are at the root of all this. A good example is campaign finance reform where there are matching funds spending caps and such. Piracy is a really good way to keep from moving spent money into, say, Iowa and incrementally lay waste to the cap before you've decided if you're going to get matched. It's a complex set of considerations and public perceptions. There are a lot of little dances that campaigns do, and piracy is a really good way to disappear major expenses in a very cash-constrained environment.<p>But a very senior Democratic political operative sat me down once when I was trying to convince him to buy legal licenses for an Iowa office. He said, ""Dave, here's the deal: if we lose, there's nothing to go after. We'll leave the stage with negative money and nobody to pin it on. If we win, we are the Executive Office of the President, and we've got the Antitrust Division. Do you really think Microsoft, of all companies, is looking to pick that fight?""<p>tl;dr: Politicians operate vast organizations with questionable legal practices called campaigns. These campaigns get them elected to power and make them rich. Once elected, they legislate against the citizenry doing the things they did to gain power and wealth. This is not a conspiracy. Turns out they're just assholes.",1326893855

Here is their definition of SOPA:<p>If SOPA passes, copyright holders would be able to complain to law enforcement officials and get websites shut down. <i>Search engines and other providers would have to block rogue sites when ordered to do so by a judge.</i> Sites could be punished for hosting pirated content -- and Internet companies are worried they could be held liable for users' actions.<p>I placed the emphasis around the offending line.  This wordplay makes SOPA sound more palatable.  Under DMCA, copyright holders already have the right to demand that websites take down offending material.  Under SOPA, a judge can order the search engine itself to be shutdown.  Search engines, news aggregation sites, and online community providers must be proactive in removing links before a judge is even involved.  Under SOPA, the definition of a ""rogue site"" is anything that happens to have a link or piece of information representing a violation of copyright.<p>See ""No Duty to Monitor"" at http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/technical-examination-of-sopa-and.html",1326893791

3479515,comment,3478850,3478850,0,0,kamaal,,,"Ok,<p>Let me tell you why Piracy, it works most people who sell stuff them self want piracy to work.<p>To start with this let me tell you something. I didn't have genuine exposure to computers until I was 17, The first time I really worked with a computer seriously was in First semester engineering. Here in India it was not very easy to afford computers for guys like me. In the first semester I went to a friends home who had a PC. And he had Windows installed. I guess it was XP. Another friend said he is soon buying a PC and wanted the Win XP CD. I was flabbergasted to know how easy it was to just copy the CD and install the OS on an machine.<p>Only many days later did I learn, If Microsoft wanted they could stop piracy easily. But they don't! Why? Because they want people to be trained in it, right from college. So that when they get jobs their employers are forced to buy the OS they are trained to work in. Most of my friends also bought endless pirated game CD's. Here in Gandhinagar, Bangalore you can buy pirated CD's like peanuts on the footpath. Again, why don't they stop it? They can if they want! But why the hell don't they do it?<p>Now coming to Music and art piracy. Even here, upcoming musicians can't really expect people to shell out money for their work. Piracy acts as an easy distribution medium. Trust me piracy is a blessing in disguise for them.<p>Sorry to say, but you have all the power to stop this thing without stealing our liberties. But you don't.<p>Also expecting people to be morally upright and not get into Piracy is big BS according to me. Its like parking your Ferrari in a lonely street in the middle of the night, with the fuel tank full and keys inside. Its bound to be stolen, don't blame the world for it. You are to be blamed for not taking the right precautions when you actually could have!<p>If Microsoft bans Piracy in India. I assure you they will have to beg and plead with people to even make a single sale. People will be happy to buy a non OS installed computer and install Linux on it. They don't want that to happen, they know it, we know it.<p>This is why you can't end piracy.",1326893379

I think the key point here is that property is treated in law as a right, but copyright functions as an anti-right.<p>I'll try to explain what I mean by anti-right though I'm unpracticed here.<p>(1) Society is oriented around a presumption of live-and-let-live. Most laws give rights that state the boundary of live-and-let live, and these are positive rights.<p>(2) In the case of copyright, only the creator has the ability to live-and-let-live in the context of the protected thing: everyone else is restricted from it. Hence, this is a negative right, or ""anti-right"".<p>When rights and anti-rights clash, you get nasty situations develop where they can't all be true at the same time.<p>i.e. in order to make IP anti-rights work, the laws need to inhibit 'real' property rights.<p>i.e. I am not allowed to do things with magnetic signals in the privacy of my own home because that impedes an anti-right that the government has granted to someone else.<p>If you build complex software with a permissions model that contains both positive and negative permissions (i.e. where a user has a permission that is ""can't see"" something rather than being a positive right), you'll find similar nasty situations develop.",1326892695

Copyright exclusivity can slowly be ramped down at the same time the government gradually provides more and more services for its citizens.  One doesn't have to come before the other.  Meanwhile, there certainly shouldn't be any new enforcement of copyright (or patent) exclusivity where none existed before.<p>2. Copyrights aren't rights.  They're tradable monopolies upheld by the government.  You'd actually be giving artists more rights by removing exclusivity.  No longer would be able to take away their right to do whatever they want with their own work.  The artists who are in it for the money are doing it for the wrong reasons.<p>3. The economy will never work as I describe it as long as copyright exclusivity enforced.  I don't believe in copyleft.  It still involves keeping track of licenses on everything, which can get very out of hand.  Big corporations should be able to use free software too.<p>Copyright exclusivity is the only reason an intellectual property market exists today.  The law can affect the economy and vice versa.

So, they'd be breaking not only their own internet but everyone else's too - and they simply do not have that right, morally speaking.<p>If bills like SOPA/PIPA pass, I intend to write to my MP about the importance of establishing a separate infrastructure that co-operates with, but is not dominated by, the existing system.  The US has too much control over things like name authorities and SSL root CAs.  ICANN is a US corporation.  If the US wanted to break the BGP routing table, they wield enough power to do it (heck, AS7007 did it by /accident/).<p>It is becoming increasingly clear that the US cannot be trusted with stewardship of the global Internet; a still more decentralised approach is needed.<p>(Maybe, if they break it entirely, we can build a new one with all the lessons we've learned over the past few decades about how to build peer-to-peer decentralised internetworking.  Plus, y'know, we could use IPv6 from the start)",1326891631

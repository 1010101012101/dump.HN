I avoid other men because I don&#x27;t want to put my life in danger unnecessarily, and I avoid women mostly because I don&#x27;t want them to be alarmed by my presence.<p>These are what I would call rational fears, because they&#x27;re about minimizing risk.

Well, it came back as &quot;zero&quot;. This, I think, reflects what happened to psychology/psychiatry over the past, say, 30 years and at least in the US: the generalization of an homomorphism between the brain and the current state of data computing. Although a very useful concept, the &quot;unconscious&quot; has been dropped because it doesn&#x27;t fit in this morphism. Or does it? Low level processes are somewhat &quot;unconscious&quot; to computer operation. There are memory leaks and odd stuff happening with memory blocks that one could see as the expression of an unconscious. But, as some people pointed out, this aspect is only a sort of malfunction of the system. The beauty of the unconscious in the brain is that it is productive. Strictly whatever it does serves a purpose: it can be protective (as in dissociation to tolerate trauma), it can be optimizing (as in handling survival functions in the background), it can be productive (by constantly scanning its database and I/O for patterns, convergences, anomalies, etc.) and, I believe, it is the very source of creativity. To the point that I wonder if data computing might not benefit from emulating such a sub-architecture...
As people pointed out, we all dissociate, somehow, in our days and that’s because we have an unconscious that does all that.
It has been a huge loss for psychology to lose the unconscious to the data computing model. And it might be a huge loss for data computing to not try to emulate our unconscious.",1425570231

I buy all of mine from themeforest for like $30.  I don&#x27;t see why anyone would do otherwise unless they needed something really custom.  I don&#x27;t like designing website templates, so I would charge $200/hr (a.k.a. I&#x27;ll never do this)<p>-E-commerce websites
$75/hr<p>-Wordpress/Joomla themes
Again buy themes from themeforest cheap.  Wordpress site maintenance and installation seems to go for $20-$50/hr around here.<p>-Some SEO from time to time
Experts will charge as much as $100/hr, basic stuff like putting meta tags in or running a google ads campaign could go as low as $20/hr<p>-Adding responsiveness to websites
Nowadays this often means starting from scratch.  I try to quote for the whole project on something like this, but to give you an idea I would say around $40 an hour (give or take 20)<p>-Website designs
Same as above.  ~$40<p>-Dynamic websites
I&#x27;m assuming this means webapp?  I charge around $85/hr for webapps.  Usually using angular.  I also have started putting the webapps through cordova/phonegap, which is an easy upsell.<p>And to icpmacdo&#x27;s point:
-remote backend development
Same as webapps, around $85/hr seems to be the magic number.  This is VERY dependant on who you know and where they are located.<p>Note:  All of my rates may seem high for people who find projects online, not in person.  They may seem low for experts in their given field.  Also, I find the larger the company, the higher the rate.  For backend work you could probably get double that if you are an expert in large corporation java work.",1425570125

What is interesting is their lack of objectiveness - they will discuss and shame for long time situation in their current/previous work, how horrible is the situation in their western country, yet they are almost oblivious to horrible treatment of women that happens region-wide half around the globe (ie &quot;yeah it&#x27;s horrible how women can&#x27;t drive in saudi arabia, BUT! that last job i had, one guy told me I women are happier when they bring up kids back home and not doing career!

That&#x27;s not something I can say I&#x27;ve ever experienced. Personally I can&#x27;t see how the joke is threatening, but I can&#x27;t dismiss her feelings over this just because I find it tough — or even impossible — to imagine.<p>I think there&#x27;s a reality here outside of anyone&#x27;s feelings, which is that the jokes mentioned in the article are neither sexist nor threatening. If she feels attacked or threatened, well, that&#x27;s her problem.<p>To be clear, I do believe there is plenty of sexism in the software industry. If there&#x27;s a joke that we don&#x27;t know about that Hank made which was <i>actually</i> sexist, then I&#x27;m happy he got fired, and I don&#x27;t think Adria was overreacting. But if the jokes in the article are the full story, then she wasn&#x27;t even overreacting--she was reacting to something which she shouldn&#x27;t have reacted to at all. The jokes aren&#x27;t sexist.<p>> You claim it&#x27;s histrionics, but it might be real things she is feeling. What if she really felt this way? Shouldn&#x27;t we try to understand Adria as well as we understand Hank? By dismissing her so easily we make our field more exclusive. We say, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine that so you mustn&#x27;t have experienced it. It&#x27;s not a problem because I can&#x27;t see it.&quot;<p>She probably <i>does</i> feel that way. I have no reason to doubt that she feels the way she says she feels. But just because someone feels threatened doesn&#x27;t mean their feelings are right. Certainly there are people who would be threatened by a black woman at a conference: and those people can go fuck themselves. It takes more than someone feeling threatened to justify firing someone. I&#x27;d have to see some joke that they made which was actually sexist or threatening.",1425569654

As part of the ownership by the public company EA, the studio was able to release and have sequels for one of the best selling games of all time.  Further, said game was distinctive in its business model in comparison to other games released at the time (it being very much about after day one profits).  That is, at least on the surface, evidence that being owned by EA does not preclude long term stewardship of a game/studio.<p>As far as the stockholders go, I can assure you that A) stock holders have no ability to influence the release schedule of a video game or B) care how profits are generated, only that they are.  There is at least a passing argument that the massively successful franchise of the studio would not have been possible without those stockholders, and the studio certainly did not turn down the money when they were acquired.<p>Whether EA mismanaged Maxis specifically or their management is in general too fixated on short term profits is not the issue.  &quot;Wall Street&quot;, whatever that is, does not demand that and would more happily not be involved in those decisions.  So is it possible that EA is mismanaging their studios in a misguided attempt to cook their books?  Maybe, but if so that has been true for Maxis for going on 2 decades, 1 of which was hugely successful.<p>You can blame &quot;Wall Street&quot; all you want, but it seems a simpler explanation that in a blockbuster driven market, Maxis failed to deliver blockbusters.  This isn&#x27;t surprising in the least given <i>most</i> software projects fail and even more so with games.  I find it surprising that Maxis lasted as long as it did quite frankly.  An independent studio would probably not have survived Spore, and I think Maxis did largely because  they were backed by &quot;Wall Street&quot;.",1425569625

Ironically, these companies, with their legendarily difficult and arduous application processes, are <i>selecting for</i> mediocre developers:<p>1) We all know that the Dunning-Kruger effect is real: there&#x27;s an abundance of quantified and repeatable psychological research that demonstrates that the <i>least</i> skilled individuals are on average the <i>most</i> likely to estimate their skill to be above average.  Likewise, the <i>most</i> skilled individuals are the most cautious in estimating their skill level.<p>So who applies for more of these types of jobs?  Well, based on what I&#x27;ve heard, Google, Fog Creek, and many other top employers receive a huge number of grossly unqualified applicants.  And while I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d like to think they&#x27;re getting the majority of their desired candidate pool to apply, research on Dunning-Kruger, as well as anecdotes like the one on the article, all suggest that&#x27;s probably not the case.<p>This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve read about a top employer asking a highly-desired employee why they&#x27;d never applied in the past, and receiving as an answer, &quot;oh, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d make it through your interview process&quot;.  (btw, I love watching these kinds of interactions)<p>2) The most qualified developers can make a nice consultant salary without ever having to go through the headache of a demeaning 5-day interview process that often treats developers like disposable commodities.  Why would you want to subject yourself to that kind of process if you&#x27;re making $100,000-200,000 a year as a contract software dev (which is the range my colleagues working contract tend to make, depending on their hours and expertise)?  So whenever I get an email from employers like Facebook, I say thanks but no thanks.<p>This is not to say that these employers <i>never</i> get highly-skilled employees.  That&#x27;s obviously not the case.  But they get a very specific type of highly-skilled applicant: from top CS departments, coming right out of college.  They&#x27;re much less likely to get a highly-skilled dev to apply who has taken an alternate route to the top of his or her profession.<p>So what happens on average?  &quot;Top&quot; employers like Google, Facebook, and smaller &quot;desirable&quot; employers like Fog Creek, effectively scare off a large number of the devs they want the most, both male and female.  And they simultaneously attract a large number of unqualified applicants.<p>Yet again I ask: maybe the software developer interview process is completely broken?  Are employers in enough pain yet that they&#x27;re willing to revisit their hiring process?  Or does it need to get worse?",1425569243

People seem to drop 20 IQ points when they see spam. They either instantly rage about it or send the email to the helpdesk demanding an explanation on how someone dared email them something they weren&#x27;t interested in. Its a bizarre behavior.  Yet, when they&#x27;re forced to fish through a spam folder or an anti-spam web interface, they seem to mind that less. Which is bizarre as its tons more work.<p>I think the guys at gmail realized this and just erred on the side of caution by giving people as much as a clean inbox as they can handle.  Even if they don&#x27;t like it, who are they going to complain to? Google? Who at google gives two shits and even if someone did, how could your reach them, and if you did who has the power to change policy? Meanwhile if you run mail servers, you get complaints about how your email goes into spam, even when you have all your DNS ducks in a row and have a good reputation. When you tell gmail users to talk to google about it, they scoff and tell you to piss off.",1425569168

(And I don&#x27;t mean &quot;lie&quot;... it has non-trivial truth in it. But it is only a <i>half</i>-truth.) Generics are a complicated concept that encompasses at least &quot;generic data structures&quot; and &quot;generic algorithms&quot;; you can slice and dice in other things, too, but it certainly has at least those two aspects. The former I freely admit is an uncovered case, and I still believe is something Go needs to address sooner or later. The latter <i>is</i> covered in Go via the interfaces.<p>I think the reason why Go in practice doesn&#x27;t need a lot of generic data structures is that its core use case, concurrent network servers, has an awful lot of byte streams flowing around, and, lo, the code I&#x27;m converting into Go has a lot of byte streams flowing around. A bajillion &quot;generic data structures&quot; don&#x27;t much help with that use case. (Now, the natural contrarian argument here is to talk about how you <i>might</i> need them someday, but, seriously, you probably don&#x27;t need them all the time. If you do... don&#x27;t use Go.) The &quot;generic algorithms&quot; concept is incredibly useful, but, lo, Go actually supports it fairly well. On first read of the Go feature set it&#x27;s really easy to blip over the &quot;implicit satisfaction of interfaces&quot; and think it&#x27;s an irrelevant parlor trick, but in practice it&#x27;s really very useful in surprising and profound ways.",1425568858

The same architecture might have cheap microcoded and high end &quot;hardwired&quot; implementations.<p>There&#x27;s a conceptual similarity between uops and microcode, to quote the WP microcode article: &quot;Modern CISC/RISC implementations, e.g. x86 designs, decode instructions into dynamically buffered micro-operations with instruction encodings similar to traditional fixed microcode. Ordinary static microcode is used as hardware assistance for complex multistep operations such as auto-repeating instructions and for transcendental functions in the floating point unit; it is also used for special purpose instructions (such as CPUID) and internal control and configuration purposes.&quot;",1425568661

Look at the actual jokes involved. &quot;That hardware has a really big dongle&quot;? &quot;I would fork that guy&#x27;s repo&quot;?

Most modern feminists say that women are just as sexual as men, and that women don&#x27;t express their sexuality because of social pressure--an assertion which is gaining some scientific evidence. Ironically, Adria is enforcing a stereotype that anything sexual is anti-female.

289441,comment,289412,289412,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"Wait, you mean developers will be able to write apps that take full advantage of the OS through background process and system hooks, then distribute them without paying for keys or being vetted by a capricious bureaucrat?! AND they'll give users a choice as to what to do with their own phones?!  Quelle Horreur!<p>I've always maintained that Apple's iPhone restrictions are bullshit political decisions and have nothing to do with the protecting users from viruses and malicious apps. IF Jobs and his defenders are correct, then surely Android will succumb to horrible attacks, viruses, scamware etc. Well, the handset is shipping soon, so I definitely look forward to proving (nearly) everyone wrong :)",1219953224
289440,comment,288687,288726,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"<i>If you're successful, a 25% capital gains tax is not all that onerous. What's the difference between $20M and $15M? Sure, it's $5M, but what can $20M buy you that $15M cannot?</i><p>After the fact, yes. But a 25% capital gains tax reduces your expected outcome by 25%, so if you are thinking of starting a business that within a year you suspect has a 10% chance of being worth $1 million, and a 90% chance of being worthless, your expected return goes from $100K to $75K -- and that might rule it out for people who are already making a decent amount of money.",1219953200

So it's certainly a good market to be in.<p>In china, they have these scratch cards that you can buy at 7/11s and other convenience stores. You then use the credit on the scratch cards to buy dresses and so on for your figure. Several of the girls I knew were obsessed with making sure that their avatar not only looked good, but that she always had new clothes. So games in that style, though free initially, still make loads of money just selling add-ons and things to individualise yourself.",1219950736

My major emphasis has been buiding 3-tier web sites with .NET, mostly because .NET is what you find in large corporate environments. I belong to a mailing list in Seattle that has to do with tech entrepreneurs. One of our recent discussion has been on what ""stack"" you use to build out your website. There are basically 2 schools, the first is the LAMP stack (linux, apache, MySQL and PHP) and the second is .NET/SQL Server. You just need to pick one and go for it.<p>If you are using csh is sounds like you're already in the linux camp, so I would recommend the LAMP stack. One thing that is quite popular right now amongst tech startups is Ruby on Rails. That would be a good thing to learn. Not only to build your startup but if you get good you can contract yourself out to others. Here are a good set of tutorials to learn RoR.<p><a href=""http://www.digitalmediaminute.com/article/1816/top-ruby-on-rails-tutorials"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalmediaminute.com/article/1816/top-ruby-on-r...</a><p>hope this helps

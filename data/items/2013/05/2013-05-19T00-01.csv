It certainly isn't impossible to make a native-feeling web application, but I do think that the level of effort is comparable to just doing the app natively, and the web counterpart will still fall a bit short. For what it's worth, WinJS apps still feel clunky to me when compared to their native equivalent.<p>I think summarizing responsive design as adding media queries oversimplifies things a bit. The test overhead for PhoneGap is enormous; deploying fixes to an app is much more difficult than deploying fixes to a site, and individual devices can exhibit bugs that other devices won't within the same Android version. Adding different levels of responsive layouts multiplies that effort. By the end of one particular PhoneGap project, I literally had a dozen different devices on my desk to assert reasonably small changes.<p>The browser as a leaky abstraction thing also continues to be a pain point. One particular difficulty I had with PhoneGap was Android 2.3.x, in which div overflow scrolling isn't implemented (also, ironically enough, not implemented in WP8 IE10 when used in conjunction with the -ms-viewport CSS rule), requiring a design that either doesn't use scrolling elements, or emulates it with JavaScript. In either case, the native experience wins out.<p>Hitting several platforms with a good-enough experience may be an overriding priority, and you could certainly pick worse than PhoneGap to make that happen. For my own tastes, though, I'll be leaning on Mono for cross-platform efforts.",1368924172

While they're not evading tax (not using clearly illegal means) they're not just tax planning.  Indeed, the schemes used by these companies are pushing a language change.  Tax avoidance used to mean normal tax planning.<p>The tactics of Google, Amazon, Vodafone, Starbucks, etc etc etc mean that ""Tax avoidance"" now means complex schemes which are probably legal, but that might not be.  The schemes are complex, and require believing odd things to be true.  For example, Starbucks makes no profit in the UK[1], something that people will find baffling if they've ever bought a £4 coffee.<p>Any one of the big four accountancy firms has more staff that the HMRC.  There's big money to be made in avoiding tax.  When firms are caught they negotiate deals to repay some, but not nearly all tax.[2]<p>But the final slap in the face is that underfunded, understaffed HMRC gets ""help"" from the big four accountancy firms.  What's the catch?  What could possibly go wrong with allowing the poacher to play at gamekeeper? They lend staff to HMRC to draft tax law; they then use their knowledge of those laws (that they helped to create) to exploit loopholes.[3]<p>People really don't mind if you plan your taxes to reduce the bill.  But they do get angry when they see people ""taking the piss"", especially when the country is going through austerity measures and when the NHS is being crunched.

For example it is less productive than Gnome 2 if you have large monitors, lots of windows, and have multiple windows from the same app.  For single tasking a handful of maximized windows Gnome shell works great, especially if using lower resolution smaller screens, and possibly fingers.<p>The secondary problem is they keep removing functionality and configurability, and this isn't done in public.  I'm the first to admit that I actually like less configurability - I'd rather the developers made good choices in the first place, rather than just throwing lots of options over the wall and making it the user's problem.  But some really annoys people - for example Nautilus just lost the status bar so finding out the amount of free disk space went from moving your eyeballs to clicking in the background, making a menu selection, having a dialog appear, reading and dismissing the dialog.  I insist on using focus follows mouse, so if that ever got removed I'd be up in arms too.<p>The theory from the developers has been that Gnome 3 has a powerful extensions mechanism so you make it do anything you want.

I see, in some Resolutions of Town Meetings, a Remonstrance against giving Congress a Power to take, as they call it, the People's Money out of their Pockets, tho' only to pay the Interest and Principal of Debts duly contracted. They seem to mistake the Point. Money, justly due from the People, is their Creditors' Money, and no longer the Money of the People, who, if they withold it, should be compell'd to pay by some Law.</i><p><i>""All Property, indeed, except the Savage's temporary Cabin, his Bow, his Matchcoat, and other little Acquisitions, absolutely necessary for his Subsistence, seems to me to be the Creature of public Convention. Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it. All the Property that is necessary to a Man, for the Conservation of the Individual and the Propagation of the Species, is his natural Right, which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition. He that does not like civil Society on these Terms, let him retire and live among Savages. He can have no right to the benefits of Society, who will not pay his Club towards the Support of it.</i><p>That being said I think it's a problem that needs to be fixed in the culture and governance of a people, not in Google itself, since attempting to assign any civic duty to a multinational is probably laughable.

In the 30-35 age range, if you're looking for an actual serious relationship and not just a fling, you'll find there are a lot of girls who spent their 20s getting their careers in order and amassing life experience, and now find they want a husband but all the decent guys were taken in their mid-20s.<p>I'd say that the teens and 22-28 range are hardest for guys, and 28-35 and 65-80 are hardest for women, with college being about equal for both sexes.  In your teens most girls cluster their attention on the hottest or most socially confident guys, and from 22-28 guys have to compete with older, more established males for girls that are still somewhat attracted to the trappings of success.  But once they get to their late 20s, most people realize that a.) if they want to start a family of someone roughly the same age, they better do it soon b.) the superficial things that most people like in a partner - hotness, money, success, popularity - don't really matter much when you spend every day with them and really get to know them, and what does matter are things like kindness, character, emotional stability, etc. and c.) most of the people who realized this earlier dropped out of the dating pool and got married in their 20s.  Women have a much stricter time horizon than guys do at this point, so guys tend to have the advantage in the dating pool.<p>I've heard dating past the mid-30s is weird, with a lot of divorcees and a lot of folks with baggage from past relationships.  I see a lot of age-unbalanced couples in this range, with guys in their mid-40s coming off a failed marriage dating girls in their mid-20s, or single mothers having a string of not-too-serious boyfriends while juggling childcare and a job.  Then once you get to 65, guys again have the advantage, because women tend to live longer and so there are a number of widows while very few widowers.  I've heard that single guys in retirement communities get so much ass, but for some reason nobody wants to talk about that...",1368921788

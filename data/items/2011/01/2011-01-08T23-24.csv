2084324,comment,2083723,2084162,0,0,cd34,,,"Why are people that purchase/download your GPL app not able to get the code or share changes?  All one must do is provide a method for the client to get the code through whatever means.  The section deals with third party distribution of binaries and obtaining the source code from the author indirectly.  There is nothing stopping one from getting hold of the SDK and compiling the code you have distributed and installing it - they don't even need a developers account.  They can't distribute it without paying Apple the developer's fee and submitting it to the app store, at which point it might be considered duplicate functionality, but, that is a separate argument.<p>Additionally, a client that changes your app is not required to send you the changes back unless s/he distributes it.  Modifying it for his/her own purposes doesn't mean you are entitled to a copy of their changes.",1294531149
2084323,comment,2083723,2083723,0,0,cheald,,,"This is a good (but painful) thing. The GPL is designed to counteract the sort distribution lockdown that the App Store represents, and it's doing its job here. The GPL is diametrically opposed to the App Store ecosystem (buy once, reuse/modify never), and it's a good thing that it's being enforced, even if it does mean the loss of quality software on the iOS platform.<p>This really does underscore, however, how important it is to license your code carefully. If you want to make it completely free (as in, ""I don't care what you do with it"" free), use BSD. If you want to make sure that your software is never used restrictively and that it continually promotes the free software ethos, then GPL is a great tool.",1294531124

2084321,comment,2084157,2084282,0,0,coderdude,,,"Honestly, it's difficult for me to say. Is this two players over the Internet? More than two players? The movement mechanics matter a lot. I've never seen Tron or played any Tron games, but if it will play something like this:<p><a href=""http://www.virginmedia.com/images/tron2-431x300.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virginmedia.com/images/tron2-431x300.jpg</a><p>Which appears to be kind of like snakes/nibbles then I could see you requiring some of the techniques the article describes. Since players are mostly moving in a single direction for a period of time you could extrapolate their movements by continuing their motion in that single direction until the server is made otherwise aware of where the player decided to move. Then you can reset the player back to the position they were at when they changed direction and then continue them along that path.<p>However, for when the action gets close-up and quick, where perhaps the two players are twitching back and forth trying to avoid or ensnare each other then yes I can see how lag compensation will be necessary so that the server can accurately figure out where each player thought the other player was when they made their move.<p>Here are two articles that I think will help you, and they helped me when I was working at this problem:<p><a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3230/dead_reckoning_latency_hiding_for_.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3230/dead_reckoning_la...</a><p><a href=""http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1370.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1370.asp</a>",1294531103

Anyone got link?<p>D:  You're probably going to be vulnerable to timing attacks, but it's not the math that worries at least me.<p>D:  Your general problem is you can't trust the initial deployment in the first place.<p>Z:  Right, now compare that to a regular login. If you can't trust the deployment, then <i>all</i> login systems are vulnerable. Right?<p>D:  Yeah, but it's your job to move the ball. The generic attack against JS crypto is to just add a js sniffer that grabs txt<p>D:  The argument is basically, JS crypto can't be any better than a simple form login, because the simple form can be sniffed<p>D:  You can get around that using HTTPS, but then, why use the JS crypto? Just run a simple form inside of HTTPS<p>Z:  No, my contention is that any attack against the autho.me SRP is an attack against any browser login. Nothing can stop that.<p>D:  What you're trying to do is vaguely different, in that you've got some third party stuff going on. So I'm reserving judgment<p>D:  Yeah dude, all browser login not encapsulated in HTTPS is known to be owned (see: the Tunisian .gov)<p>D:  And honestly, almost all HTTPS login itself is owned too, because it falls back to HTTP (see: Firesheep)<p>Z:  Yes, and https+bcrypt is the option for DIY. The crypto is for getting 3rd party auth and not having to store. Not encryption.<p>D:  Your stuff ready to be looked at, btw?<p>Z:  Exactly, and if you can get XSS on the page, then you're double screwed. There's just nothing to do about it without a plugin.<p>Z:  Oh yeah, totally. <a href=""http://autho.me/start.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://autho.me/start.html</a>. BREAK IT MY BROTHER! I'll buy you a beer for each flaw you find. :-)<p>D:  So, autho.me is a SSO solution where there's no popup window or redirect to the main site?<p>Z:  Yep. Pretty simple.<p>D:  So, if I log into chat.com and auction.com, I put in the same username and password to both?<p>Z:  No, different passwords, so chat.com has its own users/passwords separate from auction.com.<p>Z:  Then there may be a feature for partners to trade user accounts, but not sure about that.<p>D:  So how is this SSO? That sounds like status quo.<p>Z:  Oh my bad. If ZedShaw,LLC owned chat.com and auction.com then they could do that, but they set it up for that, not the user.<p>Z:  Otherwise, yes, it is pretty much status quo. It's not like it's a major revolution in authentication.<p>D:  Can you explain in a nutshell what scenario autho.me seeks to improve? (You have my attention!)<p>D:  What does autho.me improve/prevent/change?<p>Z:  1) Easy setup like OpenID but own the users. 2) Sharing users with partners. 3) Simple 2-factor auth. 4) Central management.<p>Z:  And it proposes to prevent someone getting onto your server and getting all the passwords, ala Gawker.<p>D:  Well, you know SRP hashes can be cracked just like any other, right?<p>Z:  Sure, I mean people pick crap passwords so can't prevent that. The Verifier should be as secure as other methods.<p>Z:  The difference is nothing is stored by the customer, but by autho.me, which reduces the risk. Then autho.me just stores SRP.<p>D:  So, under normal circumstances, the customer stores nothing, but proxies the SRP exchange to autho.me on the backend?<p>Z:  Yep. Then autho.me only stores the username:verifier combo, no passwords.<p>D:  OK. Now what do you mean by 2-factor auth?<p>Z:  I'm toying with adding SMS verification using <a href=""http://www.twilio.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twilio.com/</a><p>D:  Tell me a little more about how your ""partner site"" vision works?<p>D:  OK so you're <i>not</i> like OpenID or SSO.OpenID/SSO lets two sites share the same user creds, without one site being able...<p>D:  ...to log into the other site. Clearly that's not a threat model you can ever support, because at any point chat.com can formsniff<p>D:  and log into auction.com. You're more like outsourced auth. Take all the normal scary parts of managing u/p and let someone else<p>D:  handle that. malicious site can still get pw plaintext, and malicious autho.me can crack verifiers, but autho.me can...<p>D:  indeed refuse to process verifier without SMS validate. So basically the crypto isn't doing too much, it's just...<p>D:  ""Keep me, under normal circumstances, from ever seeing the plaintext password. Require an active live attack for gawker to work""<p>D:  99% of your functionality seems doable just by forwarding plaintext u/p to autho.me and saying ""should i let this guy in""<p>D:  So, long story short, you might have found a use of JS crypto small enough that it's not actually broken. But is this what you...<p>D:  set out to build?<p>Z:  Ha, nice, longest stream of tweets ever. Yes, just enough SRP to make it plausible to not have to see passwords.<p>Z:  And, SSO is a misleading term since it doesn't say who is doing the sign-on, but outsourced auth is a good term for it.<p>Z:  Finally, I think most folks use OpenID not for security, but for the outsourced/low setup costs aspect of it.<p>D:  SSO pretty consistently means being able to leverage one login across multiple assets. You aren't really about doing that safely.<p>D:  Most people use OpenID? :)<p>Z:  Oh, and clear u/p didn't work because for a customer to claim they don't see passwords they'd need to not actually see them.<p>Z:  Well, the ones who do use OpenID, that's why they use it. Logins are apparently super hard and shit. :-)<p>D:  Customers can see passwords whenever they like, it's a few lines of JS. I see where you're going with that argument, though<p>D:  OpenID is a mess for a bunch of really fascinating reasons, all having to do with browser session management being nonexistent<p>Z:  Leverage one login, yes. Across multiple <i>untrusted</i> random assets, no. Nothing in SSO says it has to be between two random sites.<p>D:  Not untrue, actually. SSO across Google is indeed all mutually trusting.<p>Z:  Yes, without browser and protocol support for much stronger auth, none of the existing methods (mine included) are really secure.<p>D:  Outsourced auth where well-behaving nodes never learn the plaintext password is not without value. Is your SRP math constant time?<p>Z:  No calc time degrades exponentially. 512 right now which is the fastest safe, but I can take it up to 4096 which is really slow.<p>D:  I mean, constant time relative to the passwords in use?<p>Z:  Ah, I have not checked that. I believe that passwords are hashed to equal size keys, so in theory? Yes.<p>Z:  Also, there's a known attack where I just return a quick 401 if the user doesn't exist. Plan is to return bogus replies then.<p>D:  Might as well just ask over twitter -- ultimately, isn't this just equivalent to iframe/form to autho.me?<p>Z:  Possibly, I haven't looked into that much yet.<p>D:  Suppose you used JS Crypto to RSA encrypt a plaintext u/p from client to autho.me. Would the semantics change?<p>Z:  Yes I think they would. RSA isn't enough to reliably get auth, you also need a protocol that establishes the identity.<p>D:  I'm saying, it's just RSA_Enc((username,pw), autho_me.key). That's posted to customer, customer fwds to autho.me. Equiv?<p>D:  Isn't the username/password the identity?<p>Z:  No, you'd need to work out the exchange protocol. There's ISO methods for using asymmetric crypto for identity/auth.<p>D:  SRP isn't ISO. SRP is basically password authenticated diffie-helman. What the user knows is u/p. What autho.me proves is u/p.<p>D:  ...and what you hide from the customer (the web server outsourcing to you) is u/p. all accurate?<p>Z:  BTW, you fucking rock. The first person to have a rational indepth discussion about it since I started it. Thank you so much.<p>D:  heh, you wrote the code, that's the hard part. glad to help",1294528687

One person is defining ""faith"" to mean ""having a belief that significantly mismatches the evidence"", and you're defining ""faith"" to mean something drastically different. May I suggest either agreeing on a definition for the sake of argument, or splitting it into two separate words? You could call the first definition ""mimble"", and the second definition ""spuzz"", for example, and then the discussion might be able to go somewhere.<p>(I also don't consider your definition of faith to be particularly useful, and I suspect that you're equivocating, but those are tangential to my point here.)",1294527735

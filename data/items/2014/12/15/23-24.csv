I personally think there are too many factors at play in evaluating a series of papers - no objective sorting can really exist.<p>A note for people outside the academic Machine Learning field: NIPS is widely believed to be on a different level from the rest - during my PhD, my advisor used to say that a NIPS paper would be on par with a paper published on a good journal, resume-wise. The difference is especially striking if you&#x27;ve had the chance to attend other conferences (including, alas, IEEE-sponsored events) - that are, with very few exceptions, fairly terrible from a scientific point of view.",1418687915

8755192,comment,8751969,8751969,0,0,codecurve,,,"Scratch was my introduction to programming, around 6 years ago. Since then, I&#x27;ve graduated with a degree in CS and co-founded a successful (and growing) software-house startup. Without having discovered Scratch, I&#x27;m not sure I would have decided to do Computing at A-level. No A-level, No CS degree. No  degree, no startup.<p>In my case, it was the perfect way to learn about some of the important principles that underpin programming, without necessarily realising that it was happening. Scratch just allowed me to be creative with ideas for simple games. You can take away a lot of the cornerstones of imperative programming (loops, variables, booleans, conditionals) but also evented programming concepts; which will make sense straight away in a language like Javascript.<p>My father is a Head Teacher at a primary school in the UK and has introduced it into the ICT curriculum to great effect. There are primary age children (< 10 years old) starting to experiment with Ruby and Python at school, as a result of positive experiences with Scratch. It&#x27;s is also how I interested my younger brother in programming and he in turn took A-level computing and has applied to study CS at University. I don&#x27;t think Scratch was as much of a factor in his story, but it was certainly his starting point.<p>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a fundamental stepping stone that children should have the chance to try at school. It represents the opportunity to find out whether you enjoy programming. Until I picked it up, it had never crossed my mind that I might.<p>Hats off to the Scratch team!",1418687622

That is the mapping of our minds inductive model of the world, and our deductive one.<p>>Reading and experience train your model of the world. And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists.<p>Here, he is pointing out the the relevant information you perceive, your empirical data, is only retained insofar as it effects your deductive model of the world, that is, the model we use to determine truth and falsity. The rest of the data is generally trivial. This is a very sensible insight in my mind, and kudos to him. The dance between empirical data and deductive truth is one of the most difficult things for me to get my head around. This as a model for data retention is something i&#x27;d not thought of.<p>>Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but also to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you know things may seem part of being human, it may not be.<p>Here, i find this problematic. In Soros&#x27;s terms, the mind is reflexive.

Imagine that each paper submitted is independently either good or bad, with 22.5% probability of being good. With 1660 submissions, the total number of good papers follows a Binomial(1660, 0.225) distribution, which has mean 374 and standard deviation 17. Under this model, the fraction of good papers would be somewhere in the range 20.5-24.5% (corresponding to a two-standard-deviation window around the mean) in 95% of reviewing cycles.

Saarinen imagined that transformative ideas would emerge from groups of scientists working in meeting areas, where recliners and coffee tables still sit beside soaring windows. Instead, the scientists spend much of the day hunched over computer screens in their offices: small, windowless dens, which seem to have been created as an afterthought.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think he gives it enough credit.

The spokes that actually have offices are short hallways between these two long, main hallways.<p>I like this building. I get to see the outside world as I walk around the building - not in glimpses, but in full. During the day, there is a lot of natural light coming from the large hallway windows. More than other office buildings I&#x27;ve been in, I have a constant sense of where I am, physically, with respect to the outside world.

When things weren&#x27;t digital, it was perfectly ok to e.g. buy a nice table, make a copy, and give that copy to a friend.<p>I think you&#x27;ve just changed what we&#x27;re talking about. But I&#x27;ll run with it. Technically, copying furniture is not ok, it&#x27;s infringing on the copyright of the design. But since it requires so much effort to copy the table manually, it&#x27;s not done much, so no one really cares if a guy takes the nice table he bought and hand crafts a copy for his mate for Christmas. If he started a company cranking out copies of this design though, then it&#x27;s another matter entirely and he would be shut down and sued.<p>In the case of digital files, copying literally takes half a second and no effort. And this ease makes it something that a lot of people do, which is why people really care about it.<p>> It&#x27;s very difficult to argue that this adds up in cases where the creator isn&#x27;t selling something in a particular region.<p>You say that like it&#x27;s a choice for the creator of the work. For a lot of people it isn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s just the way the system works. They have to wait until a publisher in that region of the world wants to publish their work, or wait until legal issues clear up before things can progress etc. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a great system, but it&#x27;s what is in place, and freely copying people&#x27;s works because it isn&#x27;t available in your region is probably harming the creator of the work since their potential market is taken away from them.",1418686763

When an investment bank was a partnership, its &quot;shareholders&quot; were bankers and former bankers, with a deep understanding of the assets and liabilities _and_ of the ways in which management could manipulate their accounting.  Those owners were highly incentivized to make sure the bank was properly run, as much of their wealth was tied up in that equity, which was in an illiquid form that couldn&#x27;t easily be sold or hedged.<p>The commercial banks were always public equity, but until a few decades ago generally took considerably less risk.<p>Investment bank managements have since discovered that the public markets were willing to provide plenty of capital, with much less rigorous and careful oversight.  So they&#x27;ve migrated those partnership structures to public equity, which enables much larger and riskier balance sheets.<p>If we were seriously interested in regulating these institutions, we&#x27;d require them to be partnerships in the old form.  Nothing unconstitutional about it, the Fed could make such structure a requirement for access to its desk.

I speed this up using boiling water. At higher temperatures (170°F+) it still takes a long time to heat, even with this method. I also use a pump to improve the temperature consistency, which is not mentioned in the tutorial.

3149585,comment,3149360,3149489,7,0,Symmetry,,,"Assuming people are ""rational actors"" is a horrible idea when you're talking about individuals confronting a challenge once, but not a horrible one when you have communities of people who can all experiment and learn from each other's successes and failures.<p>There's also the special case of, well, capitalists where the actors in a market are mostly those people who have demonstrated that they can act in what an economist would call a rational manner, or else they would have lost their money.<p>A lot of economics is models built on this idea, but a lot is also empirical work looking at how people behave in aggregate in practice.  Sometimes you get chances to test models built on rational actor models against reality and they do pretty well.  For instance, theory says that if you outlaw speculation the price will swing around a lot more than in commodities that are speculated in.  Luckily for lawmakers, the growers of onions managed to get together to lobby the government to ban speculation in onions.  The law was passed, and now if you look at the cost of buying onions in bulk it swings around a lot more than other vegetables.[1]  Sometimes speculators mess up and cause price swings themselves, but they tend to even out the swings caused by demand shocks more than they do that.<p>I guess I'd say, in the end, to only worry about those theories that have been around long enough to be tested and which pretty much the entire economics profession agrees on.[1]    Really, you ought to be doing that for any field of human inquiry where you aren't directly involved, since most new surprising findings turn out to wrong.[2]<p>[1]<a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/27/news/economy/The_onion_conundrum_Birger.fortune/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/27/news/economy/The_onion_conun...</a>\n [2]<a href=""http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/02/news-flash-economists-agree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/02/news-flash-economists...</a>\n [3]<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/ow/the_beauty_of_settled_science/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/ow/the_beauty_of_settled_science/</a><p>EDIT:  Also, there's a lot of economics, even from way back when, that is predicated on people being irrational.

3149565,comment,3149360,3149360,57,0,dagw,,,"Here's my review from last time this book was mentioned on HN:<p>Economics in One Lesson is a horrible book for people with no background in economics. Within economics there are several schools of thought, and this book is little more than an outright attack by a proponent of one (fairly niche) school on another (far more prominent) school. Despite its title it isn't an textbook, but a manifesto, and as such Hazlitt's goal isn't to educate you, but to convert you. Hazlitt sets out to do this with great skill, employing every rhetoric tool at his disposal.<p>And I'll admit he's really good at it as well. He presents theories as gospel truth, making no mention of any caveats or qualifiers that you'd find in a more serious work. There is a complete lack of any sort of critical analysis of the ideas present, or any notion that they may be anything other than universal truths. He greatly misrepresents the ideas of his opponents and loves to use quotes out of context. He makes great use of leading rhetorical questions to lead the reader to make incorrect conclusions, without having to stick out his own neck and make the incorrect statement himself.<p>So in my opinion the real problem with this book is that it is so convincingly written that a naive and uncritical reading of it will lead the reader to come away with the belief that economics is really simple and that all economic problems have trivial solutions, as spelled out in this book.<p>That being said, the ideas present in this book aren't completely without merit, it's just that the few actually useful and interesting nuggets are buried in far too much polemic brow beating.",1319464151

Your idea of a hacker is someone who jailbreaks their phone or installs linux on their PC and thinks they are ""elite"".<p>My idea of a hacker is someone who spends their lives designing and building hardware or software and has significant technological skills.<p>Your ""hackers"" hate Apple because Apple doesn't compete at the low end of the market selling cheap gadgets, and since your ""hackers"" have day jobs at retail establishments, they can't afford Apple gear.<p>My hackers recognize the significant engineering effort that it takes to make what Apple does look easy.<p>Your ""hackers"" hate ability and think too much is being made of Steve Jobs, because anti-capitalism has somehow become cool on a sight ostensibly about people who want to start star ups.<p>My hackers recognize the difficulty in making a dent in the universe with your startup, and applaud Steve Jobs as for doing so.<p>Steve Jobs' has hundreds of patents.

People are committed to lifestyles they want to maintain, and categories of jobs often demand a certain minimum commitment, meaning people can't just reduce their hours for less pay.  A much strong effect is in people deciding whether to spend time perusing more education or enter the workforce immediately, since the extra years would be taxed mostly at low rates, whereas the higher income from more education all comes at the top marginal rate.<p>Also, I'd point out that a mimimum wage law has less overhead than forming a union, and so when the economy is at full employment it might be a genuinely good idea - though still probably worse than, say, a negative income tax.  In our current circumstances, though, it really is about transferring money from the really badly off to the sort of badly off (though the really badly off are less likely to vote...).",1319463298

Let's say you have no children, and work a standard forty-hour week.  I know that's not common here, but bear with me.  The thing is, that other 108 hours per week is yours, and you can arrange it as you like.  You can choose to work longer hours at a startup, or spend time on strenuous hobbies.  You can choose to stay up late and sleep in late.  You can choose to work more one day to guarantee yourself a large block of free time another day.  Whatever you do, it's a choice.<p>Now you have a kid.  That 108 hours just turned into 80 or less - much less in the early stages for just about any parent, still less for at least the next decade even if you're a selfish parent.  What's left is no longer movable from earlier until later, or from one day or to the next, because your child's schedule is not as flexible as an adult's.  You practically never get to sleep in past 8am.  When you do it's because you owe your spouse a favor - and with everything else in the paragraph it's a big one.  It's impossible to do anything requiring intense concentration, because your child is a high-priority interrupt and that interrupt triggers frequently.  My daughter (seven) is far better than most at staying occupied by herself, and even she interrupts me all the time.  You know that look you give your coworkers while they interrupt you just when you finally got into the coding groove?  You can't do that to your kid, so you don't even start anything that intense.  You code less, you read less, you exercise less, you game less, you get online less.  Your only real opportunity to have a significant block of free time is after the kid's in bed.  To take advantage of that you'll be dipping into that 56 hours per week of sleep time and using caffeine the next day to (sort of) make up for it.  By the way, I hear all of these factors are compounded when you have more than one kid, and I just can't even imagine what it's like for single parents.<p>I'm not complaining.  There are other things that more than make up for the loss of time and control over time, but it's still draining.  Still, I just have to laugh at the childless people who just assume all that time is available and flexible, who don't realize that being able to ride their bikes three hours a day or spontaneously head out for a three-day binge in Vegas is a <i>luxury</i>.  Enjoy it while you can.  Enjoy it your whole life if that's your choice.  Just understand that every parent in the world is going to have a different perspective on free time than you do.  Even though the result is worth it, losing two thirds of your usable free time is hard.",1319463039

Note that this fee is proportional to dollars sold, not per share (other transaction costs are per-share).<p>Let's say you received $.0020/sh for adding liquidity and paid a commission of $.0001/sh.  The tax would be, assuming aapl is $400/sh, $.0076/sh.  This is much larger than the rebates, which means you need to buy at least one cent below your sell price on every trade.<p>Now look at bank of america.  It's been hovering around 6.50 for the past week.  The tax there is .000114, so in fact it's possible to buy and sell BAC at the same price and make money!<p>But getting back to your question, blind market making loses money when the tax exceeds the returns.

For alpha-based (generating a predictive signal) trading, most HF signals have an amortized edge of .2 cents per share after fees, so I would say something like X=.2 would wipe out HFT",1319462597

It is also very clumsy to flick forward and backward to rewatch a fact you didn't catch the first time you watched it.<p>Actually come to think of it, that might be really interesting data the Khan Academy is sitting on: how often people try to rewatch a part of the video. Could be an indicator if they are really learning, or pseudo learning. Or maybe it is only me who sometimes needs to rewatch parts.",1319461317

That said, it also meant we didn't have any point of reference when we initially set pricing. I think we actually did surprisingly well four (4!) years ago, given the lack of information we were working with.",1319461282

The early phase development is always in simulators and on test tracks, but typically car manufacturers have deals with the governments which allow them to drive on regular roads with systems under development.<p>Of course, should something happen, there's a number to call to get towed away quickly.",1319461264

Everyone doesn't need to have a college degree. Everyone needs advanced training but that doesn't always mean college. High schools should return to offering vocational training as well as academic paths.",1319461263

Mmmm we should probably change de stars' color when hovering over them, to make people understand that they're in charge atm\n2. Yes, I've read that a lot today. My engrish isn't so bad I guess, but it seems like after countless sneezy testings, I've missed a few trads...\n3. Again, problem is that we've already focused a lot on movies not people; if we focus even less on the people, then they will almost disappear, and deegr will lose its special ingredient (ie. finding people that are like you).<p>Maybe you will actually find it useful to find people like you when you can find people like you from your town/age/sex/opposite sex... See what I mean? ^^",1319461246

Only tested and approved components can be imported, and if you do a grey import of an unlicensed part and the police catch you with it, they impound the car (some regions have different regimes/exact measures I guess, that's not my point). So modifications are already controlled, it's not that everybody can just machine their own parts and put it on the road, without having it tested/centrally regulated.<p>While if anybody could just modify the firmware in their car, there would be no way to check if that version is safe. The only option would be to allow only (a) certain, manufacturer-approved version(s), which is the exact point I was making. And by making it difficult to upload custom firmware, we (as in, regular citizens who have no interest whatsoever in changing the software in our cars, but who are put in jeopardy by morons who think they are capable of making something better but really can't) can protect ourselves (to a certain degree) against the hackery of said morons.",1319461208

7101230,comment,7100843,7101064,24,0,shykes,,,"I&#x27;m really glad you brought this up! This topic is actually very relevant to what we&#x27;re trying to do with Docker.<p>Think of it this way: we (the creators of an open-source project) have built for our project an infrastructure capable of supporting its long-term development and success without falling victim to the &quot;openbsd effect&quot;. We hijacked for ourselves a venture-backed company and are experimenting with a symbiotic relationship where both the project and the business win without corrupting each other. We get financial, legal and marketing &quot;artillery&quot; in the form of a corporate structure which is dedicated to the success of the project without distorting it. We have large stakeholder (me) who is also the maintainer of the open-source project. We have a CEO (Ben Golub) with a track record of incredible success in general, of successfully managing an open-source company in particular and with a reputation of doing business in an honest and trustworthy way. We have investors with a track record of being patient, seeing the big picture and backing open-source companies and their creators in a sincere way. These guys could have fired me at any point of our transition to this model, and didn&#x27;t.<p>So, sure, we got money &quot;<i>casually</i>&quot; (I&#x27;ll leave that battle for another day), and OpenBSD struggled to get basic funding. And obviously, OpenBSD and Docker are not in the same league as open-source projects (although I hope one day they will be).<p>But, respectfully, I think this is more than &quot;another startup gets $XXM&quot;. We are experimenting with a new model for the funding of open-source. One where the original innovators get to capture some of the value they created, fueling even more innovation in a virtuous circle of &quot;innovation -> better product -> more money -> more innovation&quot;.<p>To me personally, were we to succeed, that would be a welcome change from the current situation, where the initial inventors are trampled by savvier entrepreneurs, who race to the local maximum of the most profitable derivative business model with the highest barriers to entry, and proceed to <i>not</i> reinvest their profits in the original invention, thwarting the virtuous circle. For example, Xensource produced the open-source hypervisor and we got Amazon EC2. Linus produced Git and we got Github. I think these products are great and useful - but they are a local maximum. With the raw material of git, hypervisors and a commodity open-source operating system, we could have produced so much more aggregate wealth!<p>At Docker we want to be both git and github. We&#x27;re open-source people first, but we know how to sell a saas product and run it at scale. We know how to raise money and build a profitable business with that money. And that profit gets directly reinvested in the original innovation - Docker.<p>And I think that&#x27;s the future of open-source: if we as a community want to see less &quot;OpenBSD episodes&quot;, we&#x27;re going to have to roll up our sleeves and go about building real business value on top of our inventions. Otherwise others will, and we&#x27;ll only have ourselves to blame.",1390373718

7101214,comment,7091493,7092184,1,0,aaronwall,,,"&quot;I doubt any of the much smaller niche/hobby or family business type sites I know about would suffer greatly if Google vanished tomorrow either.&quot;<p>Many existing businesses already have awareness built through a variety of channels over a number of years, but if search were to die off some newer sites struggling to build exposure from scratch would struggle harder. That said, as Google keeps lifting the cost barrier to entry & radiates greater risk out to the smaller players perhaps building initially from the perception that Google is perpetually late / behind the curve on new sites, & that one needs exposure elsewhere isn&#x27;t a bad thing.<p>&quot;They are often beaten on volume by at least one order of magnitude by a single link from an influential blogger in a relevant field who is genuinely suggesting that their readers visit that site, or the equivalent via Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Pinterest, etc. And that&#x27;s before you count the viral effect&quot;<p>If they don&#x27;t have an SEO strategy (or are selling a unique product that people don&#x27;t know exists until they see it) & just let whatever search traffic happen on its own then sure it is easy for other sources to drive vastly more traffic than search. But if they are focused on commercial keywords, build content around the consumer demands their solutions help solve, and have an SEO strategy then search is typically in the top few referrers in terms of revenue driven.<p>A lot of the top affiliate links on Twitter or such are for iTunes song sales: low cost, low friction & low commitment purchases. I think I have had maybe a couple Twitter conversions in years, while search has driven orders of magnitude more. But both are channels that are part of the awareness process & when you add them together its more like 2+2=5.<p>&quot;their foundation is still basically the idea that you can judge the worth of a page by how many incoming links it sees&quot;<p>I think they fold in more usage data than they let on, but feel little need/incentive to mention that aspect of the algorithm.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m reasonably sure that unless they have some shady deals going on with various popular social media sites, they don&#x27;t even know about probably 90% of the incoming links to most of those little sites I mentioned&quot;<p>Did you see the bit about using Google Chrome&#x27;s data saving caching feature on Android? Chrome desktop also has security features baked into it. And there are boatloads of signed in user accounts tied to both of these. And large chunks of many social sites are crawlable.<p>&quot;All they&#x27;ve got left is the public blogs and the assorted SEO tricksters, and that&#x27;s not where a lot of people share genuine recommendations any more.&quot;<p>The fact that those votes are harder to give means they (often) have greater discrimination value. It is easy to say that social signals should replace links, but that would effectively be Google subsidizing competing ad networks. And even if we ignored that the &quot;relevancy&quot; signals in social are also the ad units, outside of those official ads there are third party strategies to ensure social is every bit as gamed as the link graph is.<p>Just today I saw this\n<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/stealth-marketing-microsoft-paying-youtubers-for-xbox-one-mentions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/stealth-marketing-micr...</a>\nand that reminded me of this from the past\n<a href=""http://www.seobook.com/images/tweet-and-get.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seobook.com/images/tweet-and-get.png</a>",1390373410

This secure token is the only thing we store on our servers, we never store your actual iCloud credentials.<p>What’s next?<p>In the future, we are thinking about ways to take advantage of the local Calendar API for users who don’t want to share their credentials, we understand their point of view.<p>We are also hoping that Apple will leverage OAuth to authenticate their calendar API, which will make things easier for everyone. We already support OAuth with Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare and Producteev. We support OAuth where we can.<p>We are a team of 7 people building a calendar with love & passion, and unfortunately we can’t always move as fast as we want, but as always, we want to address users’ issues with transparency and openness.

Of the self-identified feminists I&#x27;ve come across, both online and in real-life, the vast majority of them subscribe to patriarchy theory. A standard response to the common debating technique of switching the gender in a hypothetical scenario and presenting it as as challenge to their world view is to say, &quot;Well that may be so, but the difference is that prejudice against women is systematic, because patriarchy.&quot; So in this world-view men, as a class, cannot be victims, only victimisers; they cannot be oppressed, only opressors; and so on. And patriarcy theory permeates feminism. So in this sense, all of feminism, and most if not all feminists, to one degree or another, are male-exclusionary. I don&#x27;t personally believe that this element can be exorcised. I believe it is axiomatic, that it  and that it trickles down through the ranks even to those who consider themselves merely sympathetic to feminism.",1390372773

I&#x27;m not knowledgeable enough to weigh in, but it might be useful for you to know what arguments work well and which don&#x27;t.<p>Here&#x27;s what I noticed in your reply that I found myself questioning your authenticity:<p>1. Your first sentence is long and diminutive to the reader. I don&#x27;t know who the other person is, but maybe they did read your post and links? I&#x27;m not sure. I also am highly skeptical of anyone that refers to their extensive anything on anything. It really highly signals &quot;quack&quot; to me. Again, I&#x27;m not trying to suggest you are.<p>2. Your first sentence includes a number of terms that demand unpacking. This is really strongly related to the first point, because I feel like as a reader I&#x27;m being talked down to and then hit with some deep jargon that I don&#x27;t understand. Perhaps I&#x27;m just out of my league on this conversation, though.<p>3. Your argument on peak minerals doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to me. It&#x27;s one of those things where, I read it and it feels very strongly like when I read a staunch libertarian/Austrian economic argument between friends on Facebook and see someone cite a universal law of microeconomics and then they use it to justify something much larger or more complex. Looking up Leibig&#x27;s law didn&#x27;t help me here. I&#x27;m just left a little more bewildered and even if I read and interpreted Leibig&#x27;s law as being one hundred percent correct in its original formulation, there&#x27;s a gap in my intuition between that and your use here, as near as I can tell.",1390372698

There was some other minor shit but I felt like it was caused more by awkwardness than sexism. After my troubles I started heavily screening companies I accepted interviews at. So this was 2/8 in person interviews but that&#x27;s very high because of my pickiness. I probably did 20 or so phone interviews and either chose not to take it further or wasn&#x27;t invited to continue.<p>I also run a very large meetup group (around 4000 people) that is nearly 100% tech workers. In four years and hundreds of meetups I&#x27;ve only met a handful of guys that have issues with women in tech.

There&#x27;s a vibrant bar/nightlife scene and you can get around with public transit easily so DUIs are not an issue.<p>- The food is ridiculous - there&#x27;s delicious food EVERYWHERE. Cheap delicious food, Michelin starred delicious food, etc. San Diego has some good restaurants but SF just blows it out of the water.<p>- It&#x27;s a beautiful city (sans some shitty parts of downtown). I don&#x27;t get bored of looking at the bridge from Crissy Field or seeing sailboats on the bay with Alcatraz in the distance.<p>- Awesome access to the great outdoors - San Diego has great coastal access and some decent forests/desert areas east but consider that just across the bridge is Marin county with hundreds of trails of hiking, biking, etc. all within minutes of San Francisco not counting what&#x27;s in the city itself.",1390372485

7101161,comment,7097254,7100633,1,0,obstacle1,,,">of your professors, how many of them would you say were male-exclusionary feminists?<p>Not one. Most were totally reasonable people, interested in furthering a gender-egalitarian version of feminism that seemed eminently fair. When I say I critically engaged with the issues, I don&#x27;t mean I was out to destroy feminist arguments and advocate for the abolition of feminism. I <i>agree</i> with much of what (many) feminisms fight for. But there is always room to introduce nuance, and I found that most faculty really appreciated that kind of critical engagement.<p>However.<p>The student politics at my school -- and at many other campuses in my country -- were shockingly totalitarian. To give you an idea, the majority of student associations across the country are unionized, and are all locals of a national student federation. Every single student in each university pays <i>mandatory</i> fees (read: union dues) to these locals as part of tuition.<p>The national union was infamous for stifling even <i>discussion</i> of men&#x27;s issues on campuses. See [1] for an example:<p>&quot;This spring, the Canadian Federation of Students passed a motion encouraging all student unions to reject men’s rights groups, because they promote “hateful views toward women” and justify physical and sexual assault.&quot;<p>One student&#x27;s union under the CFS umbrella became relatively well-known for cancelling a charity fundraising campaign for cystic fibrosis, Shinerama, because cystic fibrosis &quot;disproportionally affects white males&quot; [1.5].<p>We&#x27;ve got freedom of speech enshrined in our Charter up here, yet our campuses constantly rate abysmally in free speech indexes largely because of the student unions I&#x27;m talking about [2]. Groups that <i>all students</i>, including men, are <i>forced</i> to pay money to under the theory that these groups <i>represent all students</i>.<p>Feminist groups repeatedly [3][4] tried to block public lectures on men&#x27;s issues from happening. In one case, even <i>pulling a fire alarm</i> in an attempt to <i>force</i> an end to the discussion. There is an extremely famous video of an anti-men&#x27;s-rights protestor screaming at her &#x27;debate partners&#x27; to &quot;shut the fuck up&quot; while she explains that feminism fights for men&#x27;s rights, too, so men don&#x27;t need men&#x27;s rights groups [5]. This happened at a few other universities other than UoT, too.<p>So that is the environment in which I came up, and certainly it colored my views. Hence when I hear people saying that extremist lines like &quot;every other group is a men&#x27;s group&quot; are emblematic of feminism in general, I find it disconcerting, and feel a need to argue against.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/08/01/angry-young-men/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/08/01/angry-young-men/</a><p>[1.5] - <a href=""http://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/carleton-student-group-votes-to-end-shinerama-campaign-1.345898"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/carleton-student-group-votes-to-end...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/campus-freedom-index-gives-free-speech-failing-grade-203443074.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/campus-freedom-inde...</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://thevarsity.ca/2012/11/17/arrest-assaults-overshadow-mens-issues-lecture/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thevarsity.ca/2012/11/17/arrest-assaults-overshadow-m...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/we-went-to-a-mens-rights-lecture-in-toronto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/we-went-to-a-mens-rights-lect...</a><p>[5] - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvYyGTmcP80"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvYyGTmcP80</a>",1390372415

He was based in Boston, myself in San Francisco. I would check profiles out from both locations and link him ones that I thought he might like. I was mostly just enjoying poking around the first month. I seriously approached the first girl that I did only because she played StarCraft. Ironically, the most dates (5) with a single girl off OkC I went on was with that first girl!<p>What worked for me there was picking a characteristic to look for that isn&#x27;t &quot;the sum of all features that would make my ideal girlfriend/wife&quot; to find a person. And not something generic like &quot;games&quot; or &quot;math&quot; or &quot;music.&quot; In my experience, even a specific TV show or music taste is not something people really relate over (I tried following a TV show to get along better with a girl I had a huge crush on who raved about it). If there&#x27;s something specific you spend a lot of time on that you care about, try to find that. Talk about that. Try to find someone you would just love to geek out with, not because you&#x27;re lonely and/or in need of a partner.<p>A lot of my other approaches were very similar to your messages. Asking lots of questions, showing an interest, proving I read their profile. Even though girls always demand you show you read their profile, dont ask that much. Just one question TOPS in a single message. Don&#x27;t be that ridiculously interested in knowing everything about her so quickly. Just imagine the progression you had with getting to know your closest friend you know. It didn&#x27;t start with you sitting across a table bombarding each other with questions. Pick one thing that catches your interest that you think would roll well. Go from there.<p>It&#x27;s all about playing on your interpersonal strengths (everyone has something here). Mine is in being ridiculously passionate about a few topics (eg: education, women in technology, cross-culture romances) fairly popular among women in my preferred demographic. I am also even more passionate about game design and experience design, but I try not to get into that unless the girl expresses interest. And I always lay the disclaimer of how much I&#x27;m going to geek out when we get there. I too am uncomfortable with people-touching (although I very much wanted to not be!), so it took a while to get over that. Your weakness seems to be general communication discomfort around women. Takes a little getting used to. Of course you will get frustrated, but if you let any frustration show, it will heavily backfire. So try to keep a check on it!<p>However, as you can probably gather from my comment above, I think OkC (and online dating in general) is a difficult medium to make more than a superficial connection via. Context is everything. &quot;Met online&quot; just doesn&#x27;t spark the magic. You need to have a better genesis story to even put you and the partner in the right mood.<p>Good luck!<p>PS: You&#x27;re most certainly not unattractive. There&#x27;s definitely a significant segment of women which definitely intersects the set that you&#x27;d be interested in that would find you attractive, and that&#x27;s all that matters.",1390370716

Yes, weather forecasts are better now than they were 20 years ago, but how much better? In the UK now, the 24h forecast is pretty accurate most of the time, but the three-day is very iffy, and a week out is still a crap shoot.

I don't think that's his intent.  He said he wants to keep people without a sense of humor from using his software, but sane lawyers with a good sense of humor will object to the license just as strongly as sane lawyers with no sense of humor.<p>Venue matters.  A lawsuit based on the evil clause of the license, in San Francisco or Los Angeles, would probably go nowhere.

If you want to see how to translate India into Urdu correctly, choose Arabic and take the first word ( says ""al-hind"" or ""the india"").  The core google translation matrix is derived from the six official languages of the UN (English, French, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Russian), since around 20 million parallel translations are available to the public for these six.<p>For languages like Urdu, they try to derive translations from other sources, but key among them is the corrections that users of the translation service make themselves.  So, if say a student translates an English language article into Urdu, but chooses arbitrarily to edit the translation to replace India with Pakistan, then the engine will eventually adopt this translation, if it's seen enough times.<p>Note also that the Urdu translation says ""ALPHA"" in red letters above it?  That's because they know it doesn't work, there likely isn't enough sample data to make a strong translation matrix.<p>Lastly, you might want to replace your huge URLs in your post with tiny ones (e.g. using tinyurl.com) so the page formatting isn't screwed up.",1352457786

Checkout was closed to new signups since May 20th (from the article), and Wallet has been the digital-goods alternative for longer than that.<p>My guess would be that operating a physical goods processing company is a huge drain on the resource Google hates providing most: customer service.<p>Payment disputes are a pain, especially for physical goods. Some level of mediation is required when someone has purchased a physical good but has a dispute. But with digital goods you can just tell the seller to eat it (digital good, no actual cost loss)",1382281186
6580083,comment,6579294,6580022,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>I recall reading an article saying that there is actually quite a lot of undeveloped / rural land in Japan, but people tend to live in the largest cities because large businesses want to be close to the areas of greatest political influence.</i><p>This is true in most places. The supposedly horribly expensive countries (U.K., Japan, Switzerland; to a lesser degree, the U.S.) are quite affordable outside of the major cities. And there are plenty of high-quality cities that aren&#x27;t expensive-- analogues of Austin and Portland.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that locating in a large city, for a business, and requiring people work in-office, is an unfunded mandate that borders on the inappropriate. It&#x27;s worth having a corporate office there, of course; but expecting people to live in a high-COL area if they want to have a career at your company is not only classist, but probably a tactical mistake as well. Remote work poses a lot of difficulties, but it&#x27;s the only thing that will save us from this catastrophic, worldwide real estate problem. (We should also work on high-speed, affordable trains... but one step at a time.)<p>Winner-take-all economics is somewhat inevitable, and the best that a government can do is to place a floor under it (i.e. it can&#x27;t, and shouldn&#x27;t, prevent the winners from shooting ahead; but it should prevent poverty for the less fortunate) but when WTA applies to <i>places</i>, you get wide swathes of joblessness and a few cities with robust economies but housing prices so severe as to constitute a return of debt bondage. Instead of indentured servants paying for their boat ride, now they pay a 500% housing premium for the ability to live there (i.e. access to the local job market). It&#x27;s the return of hereditary oligarchy, with real estate being passed from one generation to the next and almost unaffordable on the legitimate market (due to regulatory corruption coming from entrenched, malignant interests-- owners trying to keep their property prices artificially high.)<p>No one asks, &quot;Why did people drink so much in Communist Russia?&quot; because it&#x27;s taken as self-evident that Soviet-style communism was a gloomy, depressing system so &quot;of course&quot; people hit the vodka. Yet it surprises the hell out of people that urbanites under a runaway market system have stopped having children (and, in some sad cases, relationships and sex).",1382281183

Sure, it might give them the technical details of how to <i>do stuff</i>, perhaps very important and utilitarian stuff like purify water, but a civilization does not spring from a collection of gadgets.<p>Put a different way, for the Romans it wasn&#x27;t the fact that they could re-channel rivers, build great stadiums, or maintain public roads that made them civilized. It was the fact that over long periods of time <i>being a Roman</i> carried with it special privileges and obligations. <i>Being a Roman</i> meant something. There were shared values and ways of doing things. These shared values and ways of doing things _led_ to all that other stuff, not the other way around.<p>So a manual of civilization, to the degree one could be constructed, would be about priorities, principles, and attitudes.

6580068,comment,6578584,6579868,2,0,yaxu,,,"I think you&#x27;re complaining about someone calling a live programming environment livecoding.io. I think that&#x27;s nitpicking.<p>The feedback loops are not orthogonal, because programming a running process is rather difficult if not impossible without that programmer feedback loop. The program feedback loop exists within the process feedback loop. A change in programming feedback is highly likely to profoundly affect the wider feedback loop with the running process, and perhaps vice-versa.<p>In this case livecoding.io only seems to be for coding fixed media. Is the program actively running or not? In terms of UX it doesn&#x27;t really matter either way, so our live coding/live programming distinction is pretty much irrelevant.<p>If it was possible to do animation in livecoding.io then it would be a clearer case of live coding by our definition, but obviously that wouldn&#x27;t stop it from also being a live programming environment.",1382280893

Anything more complex than that (unless it&#x27;s a really obvious fit for awk) I switch over to Python.

Consider:<p>Situation 1) You drive up to pay for your food, you pay the price you were expecting, you leave with the same mood you arrived with.<p>Situation 2) You drive up to pay for your food, you find the person ahead has paid for you, you pay nothing, you leave happier because someone has been kind to you and you get a free lunch.<p>Situation 3) You drive up to pay for your food, and you find the person ahead has paid for you. You feel happier because someone has been kind to you, and in turn you pay for the person behind you. You pay an unexpected amount, possibly more than your own food cost. Now you leave with a lunch you may as well have paid for, but you leave happier.<p>In situation 2, the free lunch looks like the thing that makes you happier.<p>In situation 3, you might <i>pay more than your lunch price</i> and yet <i>still</i> leave happier.<p>In situation 3, everyone in the chain has gone to get some lunch, got some lunch, paid for some lunch ... and left happier.<p>And yet, if you tried to set it up to work this way - either the drive thru had a rule where you always paid for the person behind you (and if nobody was there you paid a random amount, or the average price of the previous N orders), or if there was a social expectation of same (i.e. like tipping, unwritten but obligatory), then I don&#x27;t think it would work. In fact, going there <i>expecting</i> to pay an unknown amount seems like it would make me feel worse; and going there <i>expecting</i> a &#x27;free&#x27; meal would tend to make me either order much more (it&#x27;s free) or feel obliged to order less (someone else is paying), but either way be less comfortable about the whole deal.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising to me that in the small scale, receiving kindness and/or doing something kind feels good. But it is surprising that on a wider scale, one system where everyone orders/pays/eats has minimal effect on mood and another where everyone orders/pays/eats results in a chain of tens of people feeling happier. (Side questions: It&#x27;s easy for the article to present this as a chain of happiness, but how many people in the chains of tens of cars <i>didn&#x27;t</i> feel happier, and felt indifferent? And how many felt <i>worse</i> yet obliged to participate to avoid looking stingy?)<p>My guess is that if it expands to be a social norm, it will hit the same kind of backlash as tipping does - arguments about whether taking your food and not paying for the people behind makes you a horrible person, or whether it&#x27;s okay to pay for just the price of your meal for the people behind / whether you should be willing to pay 10% or 20% more than your meal, or whether if you&#x27;re paying a random price because there&#x27;s no car behind you, is it okay for the restaurant to come to depend on pocketing the difference for its profits.<p>Could we systematise the kindness/happiness effect without ruining it?",1382279703

You can say: well, have the older servers whose price has already been reduced available for sale as well.  That complicates the lineup and is hard to manage.  Unlike the new servers, the old servers only become available when someone gives one up which makes the supply unpredictable.  With a new server, they can always buy one.  Making matters worse, if the old ones have a reduced price, people are more likely to stay with them.<p>A decent part of this is that a lot of people are probably &quot;needlessly&quot; upgrading.

This isn&#x27;t a model class, and in my understanding of OOP, doesn&#x27;t really deserve a class by itself at all. You could instead put the borrow method in a class called Book that represented the model of your application. Then you call borrow on the book, the book does some logic, and returns a status code to the controller. Or since it&#x27;s a bit silly to ask a book to borrow itself, have a library model object that handles a bunch of book objects, and put the borrow method in the library class. That&#x27;s how I do MVC anyways.",1382277883

That&#x27;s it for me. I&#x27;m really much less interested in all the other things we talk about here: languages, algorithms, hacks, investments, technology, etc. I&#x27;d rather hack my customers&#x27; problems than my own.<p>Why do I consider this paying if forward? Because of everyone who ever helped me get where I am: teachers, mentors, customers, peers, but mostly my parents and grandparents who all had difficult lives and made great sacrifices. They never had the opportunities I have now, a relatively easy life and the ability to turn nothing into something for someone else. I can&#x27;t (literally) pay them back any more, but I can by paying it forward to others.<p>I always felt this way but never knew how to verbalize it until I heard the phrase &quot;Pay it Forward&quot;.

But in truth, life keeps getting better. We live longer than ever, and with less pain (think about dental care in the 1960s). Crime is down. In America, even poor people have homes, cars, and access to music and other entertainment that was once only available to royalty. Pollution? The air and water keep getting cleaner. I jumped in the Hudson River not long ago to illustrate the point. There I was, swimming away and looking up at the Empire State building.

If they didn't set a password, or forgot it, they can request an instant login link be sent to their email again.<p>A big portion of the family market are people that aren't insanely knowledgeable about the internet.

Eventually, people realized that the government did not have enough gold to redeem all the paper currency.  People rushed to the bank to withdraw so they could get their money out first.  At this point, the government had to either devalue the currency or leave the gold standard.  Sticking to the gold standard at the previous valuation was a recipe for ruin.  Most countries chose to leave the standard altogether.  But they could have simply devalued, learned their lesson about diluting, and returned to a gold standard.<p>The lesson the Keynesians took from this episode was not to go on a gold standard in the first place.  The lesson the Austrians took was that government should not dilute the currency.  Since all government's prefer to dilute the currency, and most ""mainstream economists"" are government funded, mainstream economists are almost all Keynesian, not Austrian.<p>The best two articles I've read in defense of gold are these two:\n<a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/who-heck-is-benn-steil.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/who-hec...</a> and <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/02/return-to-castle-goldenstein-gold.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/02/return-...</a>",1230610679

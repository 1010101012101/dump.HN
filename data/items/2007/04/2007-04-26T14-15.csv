16980,comment,16972,16972,0,0,pissedoff,,,"Back in Jan I went to a person well respected in the startup community (PG knows her) in BOS.  She was a friend of a friend, I've known her for years..she previously had a high profile startup that crashed in the dotcom era.  I wanted to bounce the idea off her and get her feedback.  So I sent a presentation (marked confidential) and followed up with an hour long chat, which was helpful.  She moved to the west coast the day after we talked and 2 weeks later I find that she taken my 90% of my idea, mixed it up with social network and gotten seed  funding from a small west coast VC.  I've been developing this idea on a shoestring and on the side for 6 months.  I've got a lot invested in this.  She's hired a indian development firm and been spamming blogs with her site name to get registrations.   I've applied for a patent, but not sure it can be of any help right now. What action should I be taking? (besides wanting to run her over)",1177599361

16974,comment,16974,9770,0,0,krischan68,,,"I didn't read all 411 comments, but I think saying that the desktop was dead in a general sense (due to AJAX) and cite Apple with OS X (core asset besides the iPod is OS X as desktop!) as a nail in Microsoft's coffin seems somewhat contradictory to me.<p>Btw.: I don't think that desktop apps are really dead. System file assets/album/playlist integration (iLife suite) or the comfort of a desktop UI (e.g. better shortcut integration - which pro doesn't work with time-saving Photoshop shortcuts) will be hard to mimick in an AJAX, browser-based setting.

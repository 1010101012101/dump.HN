464544,comment,463754,464159,0,0,sc,,,"> Look at the headings. They're really beautiful. How do I do that in CSS? I can't. They are images.<p>But really, the whole point is that they _are_ doing that in CSS. The images are defined in CSS; no ""img"" tags here. Browsers (and bots) that don't have that CSS support gracefully degrade to indexable text.<p>The headings are also nothing special. Just the ""Zapfino"" font pre-rendered. You could use CSS today and get it to work on every computer that has that font installed (every Mac and iPhone, to name a few), or if the browser has more experimental CSS support, you can render any custom font (with an open license) by specifying a path to the font online. But alas, most browsers do not support this, and we developers use sIFR instead.<p>> To really demonstrate CSS you'd need to take all those style sheets and apply them to a different HTML document and see if they still looked good. No one has done that experiment (and I suspect no one will) but I predict the results would not look nearly as good.<p>That's not the point of CSS.",1233691119

464541,comment,463234,464464,0,0,chairface,,,"> I realize that css isn't the best language in the world. But if it was intuitive to write css forwards and backwards regardless of document flow -- this wouldn't be a discussion topic. The question is the amount of time invested to learn it.<p>Quite right.  The argument, as I see it, is that it's much more practical to use the best cross-platform tool for the job, which in many cases is tables and not CSS.  He's arguing that it's not worth the time.<p>> at least one follows a clear stated goal -- html describes the content, css draws the presentation.<p>This isn't even close to CSS Zen Garden's stated goal.  Its goal is to show what is possible to do using CSS.  It's goal is to be ""A demonstration of what can be accomplished visually through CSS-based design.""  There's nothing about content/presentation separation anywhere on the site.<p>> but at least at the core we can see that HTML is purely being used to describe the content<p>That's certainly not what I see at all, especially at CSS Zen Garden, if that's what you're still referring to here.<p>> Allowing _enough_ separation required for programmers to be nearly clueless of a designer's job.<p>If you mean programmer == HTML, and designer == CSS, then this is simply wrong.",1233691002

464464,comment,463234,464420,0,0,iroboto,,,">At the cost of a lot of flexibility. Most people, when faced with a change in design like this, simply reorder their HTML. So perhaps ""demand"" was hyperbole, but CSS does still push developers to rewrite their HTML when design changes happen.<p>I don't doubt that cost/time is a factor.  As programmers, we would all love to do without the additional overhead of coding practices, and for an unlimited number of reasons.<p>I realize that css isn't the best language in the world.  But if it was intuitive to write css forwards and backwards regardless of document flow -- this wouldn't be a discussion topic.  The question is the amount of time invested to learn it.<p>>The container is providing a hook for layout information that the body tag cannot. For instance, if I wanted the body background color to be blue and the container's background to be white. Also, if you want your content to be restricted in width, it's a lot easier to wrap it with a div than deal with the lack of the > operator in IE 6.<p>This is true.  I was looking purely from layout perspective, but yea, body bleeds background-color and image everywhere regardless of limiting the width.<p>>Just to be clear, I think that ""bad HTML"" is pretty much the only practical way to go right now. So, I don't have a problem with the way CSS Zen Garden uses wrappers, nor do I have a problem with the wrappers in this blog post. But you are criticizing one and making excuses for the other.<p>Practical -- yes I don't disagree.  With the way browsers interpret things differently, it's just about the only way you can get compatibility across the board.<p>Though you are right that I criticizing one and making excuses for the other: at least one follows a clear stated goal -- html describes the content, css draws the presentation.  Provided items are added to make do with incompatibility issues, but at least at the core we can see that HTML is purely being used to describe the content.  Allowing _enough_ separation required for programmers to be nearly clueless of a designer's job.<p>The other has no such goal; creating a massive grey area between the programmers and the designers.",1233688792

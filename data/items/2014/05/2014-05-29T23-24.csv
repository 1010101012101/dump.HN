7819370,comment,7818876,7818876,1,0,pedalpete,,,"I think you will want to consider it as more than just an issue of arrogance. You&#x27;re showing your hand to your competitors (or potential competitors) as well as potential employees, etc. etc.<p>It&#x27;s fine to share the details with some close confidants, if you feel it will help you and them. But are the numbers at this stage really as valuable as you think? \nFrom the info you&#x27;ve given, you&#x27;re talking a gross margin of just over $100k last year. That is nice as a young person bootstrapping a start-up with only two employees. It isn&#x27;t great as a business, depending on what you want it to be.<p>If your goal is to run a lifestyle business, than why share the details of your revenue and margins? That seems to me to be completely about ego. How will knowing your revenue and margins enable somebody to help your business? I suspect if you just told them about what you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;d still get similar feedback and ideas about how to improve or grow your business.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to create a large company from your start-up, you&#x27;ve got a long way to go. Your current revenues need to triple or quadruple. You need to grow exponentially. The info you&#x27;re sharing, in this case, just lets everybody know how far you have to go, and could put doubts into if you&#x27;ll actually make it.<p>By all means talk about your business, but be smart about what you share, and with whom. As a test, see what sort of response you get when you stop mentioning revenues and margins to people. Do you feel they are giving you less feedback? Or less valuable feedback? Do you feel that by mentioning the numbers to everybody in sight, it makes you feel better about what you&#x27;re doing, rather than the effect it is having on them?<p>Do some A/B testing on yourself and see what happens.<p>Out of curiosity, what made you post this question? Maybe the answer to your question is in that alone.",1401407944

We could repeat the massive packet loss using UDP test tools.  Rather ugly.<p>Coincidentally we had a visit from the CTO of high-performance storage vendor who happen to have a bunch of kernel hackers on their staff.  We mentioned our problem in passing and he explained how they&#x27;d nearly lost a major contract because a deployment had moved thei customer from being storage-bound to initially untracable data loss.  Digging around by their kernel hackers showed the NIC was losing data.  After a certain amount of too-ing-and-fro-ing  the vendor moved from denying the problem to admitting that their silicon had a defect that would throw away data under load, and their Windows drivers tried to spackle over the problem.  They were relying on no-one being able to drive enough load through the card to cause a problem.<p>This dovetailed with our experience, and we found that installing a different manufacturer&#x27;s card in the blade let us work around the problem.  Our blade supplier moved to a new NIC vendor subsequently.",1401404549

He’d given money to the Dating Ring to secure the chance to give even more money to the Dating Ring. He wouldn’t tell me how much he invested, but did mention a desire to buy an airplane.&quot;<p>And how about this:<p>&quot;Today’s daytime activity is a picnic in the park. I find Lisa and tell her it’s time to do as the San Franciscans have done since before the dawn of personal computing: get high. She goes to Dolores Park to seek weed from strangers, while I return to the hotel and initiate a texting phone tree. Twenty minutes later, as a white guy with dreadlocks is dumping vegan brownies onto the bed, there is a knock on the door and the Nightline film crew is standing there with a camera and a giant light. “Just a minute!” I shout through a crack in the door. When the dealer exits, I wonder if Nightline thinks I boned him.&quot;",1401404415

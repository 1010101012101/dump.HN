3742234,comment,3741813,3742133,6,0,tikhonj,,,"For one, the other companies have other redeeming features: Microsoft has MSR, Google also does some research as well as a lot of open source stuff and IBM also does good research. Even <i>Facebook</i> contributes more to the community at large and the state of the art, as far as I know. All that Apple does is mostly produce overrated products in secrecy.<p>Apple is also very anti-freedom in the GNU sense, and have horrible policies on iOS and their app store. They really treat developers working on their platform poorly, and actively work against letting their customers have alternatives. (Jailbreaking shouldn't even be necessary!)<p>However, the really worst thing is how popular they are. Their draconian policies on iOS have pushed other companies--like Microsoft--to emulate that on their own problems; as far as I know, Windows Phone is almost as locked down as iOS. So Apple is at a weird confluence of evil and popular support, which is much more dangerous than evil by itself (this is why they are more worrisome than e.g. Oracle or even Microsoft). Their worst effect is cultural--making the nonsense around third-party iOS programs seem reasonable.<p>If Linux dominated the market, you would be free to use it however you like. If iOS dominated the market, you'd have to play by Apple's rules--getting a developer account, going through their review process... And even OS X is going in this direction--you have to deal with Apple to get your code signed, and there are no alternatives.<p>In a lot of ways, Apple is worse than Microsoft in its heyday; their only saving grace is their small market share--thankfully, Apple does not enjoy a monopoly anywhere or even a large share of the desktop market. Still, ignoring scale, they really are worse than Microsoft was; the scale is the reason they get away with all the things Microsoft couldn't (like standard web browsers or music players).",1332453473

Some time ago, most disposable income was in the hands of aristocracy and later rich merchants. So they were served.

3742171,comment,3740962,3742019,5,0,sedev,,,"I think that your clarification and amplification is a very good one overall, but I have a disagreement.<p>""The fact is that U.S. law enforcement is bound by law (and the Constitution in particular) regardless of whether one is sympathetic to them, and regardless of whether or not legal standards are violated.""<p>However, that's clearly not the only thing that they're bound by: there's an evolving discourse of law, and it's especially evident in the FBI lawyer's statement that many in the law enforcement community have a fundamental conflict - that they want to be Judge Dredd, not Sergeant Joe Friday. Law enforcement officers are bound by multiple and conflicting directives, and that means that they have no choice but to choose, to exercise discretion about which of those is most important. That's normal for most professions, but I argue that we should hold to far higher standards the people who get to legally use force.<p>My favorite example is micro-scale: speeding isn't actually very dangerous among the things you can get ticketed for while driving, but it makes up the lion's share of the tickets handed out because it's easy to enforce. You can point to a specific number from a mechanical device and say ""there: that proves that this person was speeding."" Other driving behaviors, often more dangerous, can't be so directly quantified, and so are more of a pain in the ass to enforce - and are enforced less. The conflicting directives result in a sub-optimal outcome.<p>Law enforcement officers in the US are not bad people: they're normal people, like you'd expect. The problem is that when you give normal people power without accountability, evil results. As the FBI shows in the linked article, they vigorously resist any effort at making them accountable - which is why it's so critical to heap on the accountability. Further, bringing me back to agreeing with you, the standards that they're bound by and accountable to, should be as clear as possible. The fuzz in the directives is part of the expanding power of law enforcement agencies, and we should acknowledge and actively work to counter that tendency towards expanding power without expanding accountability.",1332452526

I do not feel like such are necessary in order to define a proper hacker. I believe a hacker is simply defined as an individual who enjoys experimenting with software and hardware for the purposes of exploring new unexplored implementations therein. I do not know of any other individuals that come to mind who embody these concepts but I intend to do everything in my power to search for and communicate with them. I do not have any ""formal resume"" nor do I feel as if such is important or relevant. I have a significant amount of experience with modifying and hacking operating systems of various devices but I am not going to get into the specific details right now because I do not know if I will encounter anyone of interest here. I am searching for people that are interested in innovative ideas and passionate about creative projects which will change the world. I do not know if these people exist and if so where they are located. I am willing to provide more personal information about myself when and if it becomes necessary. I have limited financial resources but I still direct these toward whatever technological acquisitions I deem relevant to continue advancing my objectives. I strongly believe in piracy, freedom of information, and anti-censorship. I have been with the internet since I was a teenager and I consider it fundamental to my personal identity. I cherish the value of online access and I am vehemently against restriction of data to those who advance the hacker cause. I believe there are very few of us real users left and we must not cease fighting for our rights in the face of authoritarian political opposition.

Their neutron flux is simply not high enough to give enough enrichment.<p>Two other types of plants you might be thinking of when taking bomb materials into account.  The russian design for Chernobyl was meant to produce electricity and bomb fuel which is why it had a graphite moderator which creates a very high neutron flux.<p>The other one is the sodium cooled breeder reactor which we chose instead of the molten salt design discussed in the article.  The sodium breeder was good at making plutonium but still was never designed to have that plutonium removed in any usable fashion.  Sodium is a tricky substance it reacts with water violently.  The french still have a plant or two going as do the Chinese but it's really not a stellar design.<p>Now, I agree about the temps and pressures being unnecessary.  The reason for these is about efficiency of scale.  In a power grid like America's where we need 1 gigawatt and greater plants, plus with licensing a plant being so difficult, you build the biggest baddest plant you can which can output the most power. This means you go with the highest temps and pressures while still being ultra safe to create a more power efficient reactor.<p>Smaller reactors which would be better for the power grids of the world.

My understanding is that guys used to be entitled to just go up and sit with unaccompanied females in public. If there was asking, it was pretty perfunctory. (This is from a woman's commentary from a documentary about the 60's, about how consciousness changed from the 50's.) In some countries, it was customary for a guy to ask the already present male for permission, leaving the female out of the decision. (This is from my own knowledge of Irish traditional culture.)<p><i>Of course, maybe I'm biased since I met my wife by simply going up and talking to her while she was waiting in line to purchase a ticket for a boat ride</i><p>The question is, how much right of refusal did she have? How much presumption was involved on your part? I'm going to guess that she had a lot of latitude on the first part and there was little presumption. I'm going to hazard a guess that you would've been embarrassed, but taken her polite refusal, had things gone differently, but not been <i>offended</i> or felt the loss of something you were <i>entitled</i> to.<p>The tricky thing in all this, is that it looks fairly harmless on the surface, but it's still pretty corrosive in aggregate. Please don't fall into the trap of being offended because what you've done has a <i>surface resemblance</i> to subtle racism or sexism. No one is saying that you were being sexist because you met your wife in a line. When one gets rid of the overt forms of [X] one is generally left with [X] that resembles something else.

But in terms of the money, there's simply no competition: LiberWriter wins by a huge margin, even though it's simpler code that doesn't do as much.<p>The big difference is with LW, people pay me directly.

If no law enforcement agency enforces corporate policy over individual rights, do they all then get the right to invade privacy without a warrant? No, they don't.<p>My ""should"" above, is because it leads to polarization. Lots of people are not sympathetic to police, but lots of people are, and we don't want to nudge the latter in the direction of downplaying constitutional safeguards.<p>In my ideal world, law enforcement would never violate the standards they are bound by, and everyone would say, ""I am sympathetic toward law enforcement agencies.""

Richard Stallman , for example, is no longer a hacker.  He's too caught up in the ""why"" of open source software.<p>""The money problem"" as pg calls it, is a significant barrier to being a hacker.  Solve the money problem and you can work on whatever problems you want without worrying about why and how.<p>YCombinator seems to be aptly named.  It is an attempt to solve the problem of solving problems.  That is why it is the ultimate hack.",1332450183

Until now I thought it was quite idiotic, but your revelations do make sense.<p>Though I still think that the ending scene is badly handled. If the point is that Cobb doesn't care any more about the outcome of the spinning top, then Nolan should have just slided from the image of the top to Cobb and his children.<p>By zooming in on the top and cutting the shot right before it should falls, it just adds this unneeded baggage of questioning whether all that happened is real or not. Like some sort of magic trick. ""Do you doubt what you've just seen?"" And I just didn't find that that was the point of the movie.",1332450155

For a couple thousand dollars you can easily work up a website and suitable promotional materials, form a corporation and so on, and then you just wait for the money to roll in.  Cure for cancer!

I always thought web-apps arose because people thought the web was the best way to connect with their users, and SaaS because they felt that was the best way to keep costs down.  In neither case does the protection of intellectual property enter the picture at all . . . but let's say, for the sake of argument, that that was a significant motivation.  Would that be right?  Would it refute the GP's point?  I don't think so.  It's still awfully easy to say that other people's code should be free.  If anybody really is adopting these approaches to avoid having others ""pirate"" their code, I certainly hope they're not ""pirating"" or freeloading themselves.",1332450005

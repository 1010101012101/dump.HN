It's genius: use real-life sales people to approach gamers in net-cafes, sell them something that simultaneously grants psychological pleasure and will save them time. Then slowly leverage the basic human need for approval and acceptance, stoke their pride, and watch the money roll in. This works especially well in China because in a land of so many people, ""individuality"" and ""personal worth in uniqueness"" is worth a lot of gold.",1217005088

In general I'd rather use an Apple product than a more mainstream corporate vendor product, assuming they're solving the same need.<p>So my apologies, I'd mis-interpreted your post.<p>I will however take issue with the veracity of this: ""But that _doesn't_ cut it in most corporate environments. If you've told me X is going to do Y, it sure as hell better do Y or there's 10 other vendors waiting to replace you.""<p>I can't tell you how many times I've seen vendors who have caused week long delays, production system outages, failed uptimes, breech of contract, unreliable hardware (not just a single box, but an entire line), buggy software, and the consequences are.... an apology on a con-call.  ""Oh we can't replace them, it's a corporate standard"" or ""well, our contract with them is another 3 years, so..."" or ""replacing their system would cause too much disruption"".  I've seen a totally useless, misleading, etc... vendor replaced just once in 10 years in enterprise environments.<p>Quite frankly I think that is one of the reasons companies love targeting large corporations.  It's slower to get in, but once you're in, it's almost impossible to be fired by your client.  A home PC user can ditch a phone, computer, mp3 player, etc...  a million times easier than a large corporation can replace a vendor who has a 5 year contract, whose SVP golfs with your CEO, who has 5,000 products in place in your org, that 5,000 people have been trained on, that have to be uninstalled by trained folks, and hauled off by union labor, etc...<p>How often have you really seen a vendor to a large corp being replaced versus the number of times they've failed to deliver?",1217004896

It made GOOG business sense to assist in generating valuable content on the internet, which attracts eyeballs and gives reason to surf at all. Since then, they must have figured out, that it would be much better, if they could own the net completely. At least they are trying ;)
Until you cannot dump Knol and modify it at will, it will be never free, hence it will never compete with wikipedia (which ironically is shooting itself in the leg, giving room for and old-new wikipedia).",1217001999

So not only can't people log in and update them (a facility which, arguably, makes Wikipedia a bit <i>too</i> dynamic) but they can't even clone them under their own byline and make fixes. The result is going to be a bunch of sad-looking abandoned articles, like the dregs of About.com. Say what you will about Wikipedia: The thing is often up-to-date within <i>minutes</i>.<p>- If, indeed, Knol gets favorable treatment in PageRank -- even if its advantage is only slight -- people will soon figure out that it's more profitable to dump 10,000 crappy articles on Knol than to craft one perfect article and keep it updated. The ads will show up anyway. Heck, it might be <i>more</i> profitable to put up a page with poor content and a bunch of ads -- that way frustrated readers will click through on the ads to escape. That's how domain squatting works.<p>We can certainly look forward to seeing just about every Wikipedia article mirrored on Knol. The software to do that is being written right now; maybe it has already been written. Interestingly, sites filled with ads used to do that to get a lot of PageRank, but I haven't seen any of those sites on a Google search recently. I guess that might change now that Google's getting into the linkjacking business.",1217001847

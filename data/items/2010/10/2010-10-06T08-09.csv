What I mean is if this is work related, perhaps you want check your mental model of the work and the results expected from you.
For example: I spent too much time considering (most of the times unconsciously) what kind of solution is expected and how people would react to it. This sounds like an odd thing to do but it wasn't like I chose to do this. But it was a conscious decision to get rid of it and regain the initial (for lack of a better word) playfulness. And live with the consequences. Somehow it nests easily in a mind that serious work shouldn't be fun and is all about mindlessly meeting requirements. I find that it is important to not let this happen.
So far the results have been pretty good for me.",1286355024

I don't need a lot of RAM per machine, so I've got a whole bunch of 512 instances scattered around their various data centers; all purchased bandwidth is pooled, so even if a node goes over its allocation, I don't pay extra unless I exceed 200gb * number of leased nodes across all nodes in a given billing period. That's made it very easy to make a decision between horizontal or vertical scaling; they're the same cost, but horizontal scaling gets me better geographic coverage.<p>I do wish Linode had some sort of plan for extra bandwidth that was more cost-effective than just purchasing another node outright, though.",1286354549

1763141,comment,1762856,1762856,0,0,aboodman,,,"I used to have something like this problem, and it turned out to be very simple: hunger.<p>I had a bad habit of not eating when I was deeply into something (or deeply stressed), and my body would simply run out of fuel. I think there is something weird about my physiology that causes me to not notice hunger as much as others. So I wouldn't feel super hungry, but I'd get this spacey, apathetic, faded feeling and have trouble focusing.<p>The longer I waited, the worse it got. But I'd already wasted so much time, I'd feel bad 'wasting' more by taking a break and getting something to eat. So it would go on like this, sometimes for a couple days at a time.<p>After a few years of this I happened to meet a beautiful, loving girl who also liked to cook. She made sure I ate at least one good meal a day, and lo and behold, the focus problems largely went away. I put two and two together and nowadays when I feel the fadey feeling kick in, I know what it is and get up and get a string cheese or something.<p>I imagine this probably sounds ridiculous, and I think I may be the only person on earth to have this specific issue. But I just wanted to reinforce the _practices_ bit. It could be something simple. Maybe find a trusted friend or coworker to watch your work practices for a few days and tell you if anything seems odd?",1286352153

If you're in Shanghai, let's meet up...<p>I can't comment on the group think or not on Groupon here.<p>One thing though, as a user of groupon type deals (well meituan, lashou and enjoymeitian), I find that most deals I bought didn't bring anything for the shop owner... Either the discount was too steep and in that case I'm unlikely to ever want to pay the full price to come again or it's a shop I already know and enjoy (happens to me a lot with restaurants deals).<p>So, I think that Groupon and clones are a useful tool to have, but one needs to think very carefully on how to formulate the deals. The discount shouldn't be too big or you'll attract people who are too cheap (or don't have enough money) to pay for your service at normal price. You also need to find a way to make them come back.

If you feel uncomfortable or dismissive of this line of thinking, consider a quote by Jefferson: ""Question with boldness even the existence of God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear."" If programming is the profession that truly satisfies you and complements your abilities and personality, then it should withstand critical probing. Is this something you're doing because it's comfortable and you've never looked elsewhere? Are you truly competent?<p>2. Build something. 
Something simple and tangible. 
Get an $10 point & shoot camera, go into the woods and take 20 pictures of wild flowers. Print the pictures and make a physical album. Do as many of these small, creation-oriented, achievable ""distraction projects"" as you can. 
In my experience, they provide a great boost of self-confidence, and this allows me to think about personal problems with perspective and calm. This allows me to introspect in a healthy fashion. Heavy weight lifting and long walks seem to provide the same boost to my thought process.<p>I hope that helps.",1286352055

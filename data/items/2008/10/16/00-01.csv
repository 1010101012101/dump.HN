We added FamFamFam silk icons, used JFreeChart for charts and some scriptaculous for transitions and effects, and the whole thing came out looking great.<p>This may be off topic, but I think part of is it the graphics, and part of it is the AJAX ""feel"".  By that I mean, even though Google Reader and GMail are AJAX apps, they don't ""look"" like it.  I think that is kind of the point though: they're functional, and they don't get in the way.  We used lightbox type effects, loading buttons and drop downs sparingly, to really enhance the user's experience.",1224118765

If you broke the company up into small, discrete, chunks you could probably get under the investor limits and not have to file a disclosure. You would basically be letting the market allocate funds within a firm.Then, the firm just breaks up profits and gives dividends. Of course, the term ""firm"" doesn't really fit here, things would be much looser than what fits into our present definition.<p>You would still need a crazy team of lawyers to avoid trouble, but it's certainly a loophole worth looking into and a very efficient system for allocating capital.",1224117686

I&#x27;ve seen so many losers and fuckups (people I&#x27;ve worked with who have destroyed teams and companies) with large numbers of tit-for-tat, glowing recommendations and ridiculous endorsement counts. I haven&#x27;t played that game (and have an extremely boring LI profile, with past employers not listed) and my numbers are embarrassing.<p>It&#x27;s more like the &quot;tragedy of the uncommons&quot;: bland people fighting to establish themselves as somehow special or superior, and fucking up everything for everyone. It just generates noise, and the winners are the people who are best at making the right kind of noise.<p>LinkedIn also tricked a generation into giving up one of their most important professional rights: the right to reinvent themselves. I use it, because the information is useful, but I feel like the world was a much better place when professional oversharing wasn&#x27;t expected. When labor overshares and capital doesn&#x27;t change what it does, who should one expect to win?<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, I don&#x27;t have an ethical problem with social proof arbitrage. Even if I did, that&#x27;d just mean losing to others who don&#x27;t follow such rules. The main reason I don&#x27;t do it is that I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m apathetic about &quot;social proof&quot; in general because, in humans, sociality is inversely proportional to quality. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to work at a job where the difference between a 2000 and a 6000 follower count mattered.",1402257507

It&#x27;s housing bubble 2.0 and there&#x27;s just no other way around it -- millennials leveraged up after being told for years that college was the path to prosperity and simply haven&#x27;t seen the prosperity.  The default rate on student loans is way up because, by and large, we&#x27;re not making as much money, are less likely to have a job, aren&#x27;t forming households and have massive debt/income ratios in comparison to our parents generation.

Imagine, for example, the crime-enabling aspects of cars and highways. A small group of criminals could literally ransack an entire city by using an automobile to drive from one heist to the next, keeping ahead of the police by virtue of their machine&#x27;s great speed, and finally fleeing the local jurisdiction altogether to someplace safe. What this ignores is that police will have cars too, negating the speed advantage of the criminals, and radios and telephones to alert neighboring jurisdictions, and cameras to identify the culprits, etc.<p>Or consider the airplane. A small group could acquire a decent sized cargo aircraft, load it up with bombs, and then fly over Buckingham Palace with it and essentially hold the entire country hostage. Firearms don&#x27;t have nearly the range to reach an airplane at altitude, so there would be no way to stop them. With the great range of the aircraft, there would be no hope whatsoever of tracking it back to its origins and thus apprehending the culprits.<p>But of course the technology that enables this scenario also prevents it: fighter aircraft, radar, and surface-to-air missiles mean that this attack is laughable rather than terrifying.<p>Presumably, the technological advances that enable biological terrorism will also enable biological counter-terrorism. If it doesn&#x27;t, then we are doomed. Either way, massive surveillance systems are an unrelated thing.",1402255404

We already know how fusion works; we already know what conditions we need to create to make a fusion reactor self-sustaining. What we don&#x27;t yet know is how to create them here on Earth.<p>So the question isn&#x27;t about fundamental knowledge; it&#x27;s about engineering and economics. We&#x27;ve been trying to make tokamak fusion work for decades. The Alcator C-Mod experiment that&#x27;s mentioned in these articles was put into place while I was at MIT in the mid-1980&#x27;s, and people back then were saying we would have ignition, a self-sustaining controlled fusion reaction, sometime within the next decade. It&#x27;s now been three decades and we still don&#x27;t have ignition. Certainly the experiment has been upgraded and refined and has continued to yield useful data, but that&#x27;s not the crucial question; the crucial question is, is it worth the taxpayer money that&#x27;s been put into it? That money wasn&#x27;t supposed to buy useful data, it was supposed to buy ignition.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not arguing that the funds for MIT&#x27;s experiment should be redirected to ITER or to the other US sites mentioned in the article. The same reasoning that I just applied to the MIT experiment, could be applied to <i>all</i> of the fusion research that&#x27;s been done since we started doing fusion research. We simply did not realize the magnitude of the engineering problem involved in achieving a controlled, self-sustaining fusion reaction without a Sun&#x27;s mass worth of gravity to confine it.",1402254923

TDCT is the Canadian corporate entity (and parent corporation). TDB is TDCT&#x27;s US banking operation.<p>TDB has password restrictions listed in the article (8-32 characters with some special characters). TDCT restricts one to the 8 character restriction (!), as you pointed out. EasyWeb is the name of the TDCT (Canadian) online banking site. There is no corresponding brandname for the TDB (US) online banking site.<p>The highly restrictive TDCT password is why I have to keep changing my TDCT password rather often compared to other online banking accounts.",1402254034

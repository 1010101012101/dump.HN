I'm sure everyone on Hacker News would love to subscribe such a service but the rights holders are having none of it.<p>What's stopping these companies is not that they can't push the bits but that they want to protect their existing investments and not find themselves in a commoditized and highly competitive market with many players.<p>Comcast in most markets has no competition for cable, Dish has no competition.  They don't want to race to the bottom and compete with upstart startups that we might be running - so they're playing hard ball with the rights holders (or they are the rights holders too - Comcast owns NBC) and having none of it.<p>I like Bram, I like this technology and I think there are lots of awesome things we (away from mainstream) can do with it.<p>But it won't kill TV because the majority of people want mainstream content.

But I could say I had a law degree from Harvard there as well, just listing something proves little. It's been some time since I actually used a CV in my career, but when I did there was not once an attempt to validate any claims, my skills and talents were evaluated from the thinking I demonstrated and rapport I established in each interview, not from validation of credentials which never once happened.<p>""Do those approaching you with proposals for work know that you went to Stanford?""<p>Those who approach me and talk to me don't know anything about my education as far as I know, it's just not been discussed in years, my reputation and track record are what is important.

MIT is now saying (on their MITx web page) they intend to, after working out the kinks, start offering credentials with their MITx program and ""validating"" students identity. How this will work internationally one can only imagine. Remote classes can't really be validated as to who took the class: it's impossible unless they plan to monitor each student via a video camera, which is unlikely. Given that ""identity validation"" proves little, why even bother with it? Why not just allow anyone to take the class, given that it is intended to be free -- if education is the goal.

1) The logistics wouldn't be there. Not necessarily because people won't pay, but because paying is a barrier to entry. Even paying a penny would filter out a number of users. Would you really believe that the reason those people wouldn't pay a penny is because they are cheap? Or is it more likely that the paywall is a barrier that they are too lazy to overcome?<p>2) Charging out-right for the service vs. making money on advertisements would also be a shift in their image.

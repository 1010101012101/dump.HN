Let&#x27;s say they can both accomplish the same amount during that timeframe. It&#x27;s still /not that much/ especially if you are taking any design into consideration beyond popping bootstrap on it.<p>2) zero iterations. (and this is perhaps a bigger problem, since the first can be solved simply be changing it to a prototype for $10k or whatever) I&#x27;ve never seen even an MVP come out fully baked without a lot of iterations at the beginning. Arguably prototyping is the process of rapid iteration. One and done just doesn&#x27;t work for what a prototype needs.",1398743978

When the term &quot;bipolar&quot; starts to be used to describe someone&#x27;s mere eccentricity, it indicates awareness of the condition has increased, but the level of ignorance has remained the same.<p>A good example of ignorance related to depression:<p>Many people who suffer from depression have problems with anger. From my experience being diagnosed as a loony correlates with an increase in aggression among your fellow humans that is mainly directed towards yourself. I don&#x27;t see how subjecting someone with anger management problems to more anger and aggressive behaviour is going to help them.<p>A diagnosis of mental illness is a diagnosis, not an answer to or explanation of a problem, which is usually how it is interpreted. Appropriate action will help the problem, as opposed to thinking that a prescription of escitalopram or fluoxetine will just make the problem fizzle away.<p>One more point: people with mental health problems dislike being talked to and treated like naughty children. That is the quickest way to lose their respect.",1398743890

7664832,comment,7662471,7664364,1,0,FD3SA,,,"This may surprise you, but I absolutely agree. I am very much in favor of a religious lifestyle. I have come to understand that humans need to feel that there is a greater purpose for their existence in order to temper their destructive desires. Of course, this was probably the insight that led to the creation of the very first religious writings. Our ancestors are not as stupid as we are led to believe. Religious writings are absolutely the greatest works of literature known to man, having been so widely preserved and distributed.<p>However, there is a small issue. I want to live in a religious society whose morals are practiced, not just preached. I am hard pressed to find such a society. I have no preference of religion, just a preference for a society where people are united in a community and behave cooperatively.<p>Unfortunately, most capitalist democracies do not work in this fashion. Ruthless competition is the name of the game, and the usurious practices which reduce most men to beasts of burden are rampant. The elected leaders and their elite masters sing songs of virtue, yet ruthlessly undermine the common working man at every step.<p>What good is the gospel when it is only preached and never practiced?<p>Addendum: For those interested in the evolutionary history of religious practices, please see <i>Darwin&#x27;s Cathedral</i> [1].<p>1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Cathedral-Evolution-Religion-Society/product-reviews/0226901351/ref=dpx_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Cathedral-Evolution-Religion-S...</a>",1398743421

But, you aren&#x27;t getting one stray hit. You get 20 hits on this revolution, 6 on the next, 21 on the next, and so on, and then use various algorithms to determine if you are seeing objects or noise. Recall that besides the inaccuracy of the spinning lidar (it does not hit exactly the same spot even when sitting still and hitting an immobile object), the car is moving. Any decent Bayesian filter derives a heck of a lot of information from these changes. I&#x27;m not talking about the physical change, which is also important (change of position = change in angle = different reflection point). I&#x27;m talking   about how your process model generates information via hidden variables - from position over time we derive velocity, and the correlation between velocity and position increases our accuracy. In the context of the LIDAR, the filter can detect that there is a small clump of points moving towards the car at 70 mph (from it&#x27;s point of view, of course from our POV it is the car approaching the debris at 70 mph). Reflections that are true noise will not be clumped, and will not consistently have a velocity that matches the car&#x27;s.<p>With all that said, I&#x27;ve just played with the LIDAR, I can&#x27;t give you lower detection limits.

I ended up losing care, going off of my meds, and by the time I was back in Texas and had the income to support my needs (I came from a very poor family) I had lost 30 pounds (down to 98lbs) and had lost 25% of my lung capacity.

7664663,comment,7661493,7661493,2,0,userbinator,,,"That example in figure 1 really confused me for a moment, since it&#x27;s a mix of GAS and Intel syntax - no $ or %, but with size suffices and the opposite operand order.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to observe that &quot;brute force&quot; approaches to optimisation are yielding very good results, but I&#x27;ve always believed (and in this case, the &quot;in <i>some</i> cases, expert handwritten assembly&quot; phrase somewhat seems to support this) that making compilers more <i>intelligent</i> is the way to go -- make them &quot;think&quot; more like a human Asm programmer would.<p>For example, using their first sequence, 3 out of 11 instructions are moves that do nothing more than unproductive &quot;register shuffling&quot;, which suggests to me that there&#x27;s still room for improvement. As the saying goes, &quot;the fastest way to do something is to not do it at all.&quot; That shuffling is only there because they constrained their register usage, and if I was implementing this, I&#x27;d arrange the code that came before such that the right operands are naturally in the right registers when instructions that require them e.g. mul are used. To my knowledge, this technique is not implemented in any compiler and none of the existing research on register allocation or optimisation mentions anything like that; instead they all seem to suggest &quot;introduce extra moves and hope we can somehow remove them&quot;... which doesn&#x27;t work as well as <i>planning ahead</i> so you don&#x27;t ever need them in the first place. Moves should only be used for making copies of values, since instructions that do other operations can implicitly &quot;move&quot; data as part of their operation anyway. Applying this principle to their first example eliminates two moves and yields this sequence:<p><pre><code>    shlq 32, rcx\n    movl edx, eax  <-- move + zero-extend\n    xorq rcx, rax  <-- why xor? or probably works too\n    mulq rsi\n    addq r8, rdi\n    adcq 0, rdx\n    addq rax, rdi  <-- we want result in rdi anyway\n    adcq 0, rdx\n    movq rdx, r8   <-- this is still &quot;room for improvement&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI think the same goes for optimisation as a separate pass - the idea of generating horribly inefficient code (gcc -O0 is a great example) and then trying to optimise it just doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me; in my mind, if I tell a compiler to do max size or speed optimisation, it should be selecting and generating instructions that are pretty close to optimal already. I wonder if this is a result of that famous &quot;premature optimisation&quot; quote...<p>&quot;Fastest&quot; is also something that can be highly dependent on the processor model, so this is also important to keep in mind if you&#x27;re compiling on one machine but executing on another. If anyone would like to, I&#x27;d be really interested in seeing the performance of my two-moves-less sequence above vs the one in the paper (don&#x27;t have a 64-bit machine to test this on at the moment.)",1398740424

Most of these kids then moved to other schools, and particularly to the local school that opened a class for bright kids. But I sure as shit wasn’t leaving my friends!&quot;<p>&quot;But to be good at maths was to be in solitude – or elitist and removed from friends.&quot;<p>&quot;In high school I sat an IQ test and got accelerated in mathematics and in science. It was social suicide, but luckily I fell in with some amazing women in the year above me and always sat at the back of the class which eventually leant me to (almost) social acceptance across both grades.&quot;<p>&quot;It was my secret shame – hanging out with the most beautifully intelligent (yet socially inept) kids of the school did not bode well on my social resume.&quot;<p>&quot;So: after so much discouragement, social outcasting and lack of appeal to my introverted self, my pre-tertiary education beat the passion out my left brain entirely.&quot;<p>&quot;Socially, the path to becoming a female tech pioneer from here on out could be a struggle for me personally.&quot;<p>&quot;it was painful to be good at something, love it, but to then be punished for it in the schoolyard. I’m a social butterfly, dammit!&quot;<p>CREATIVITY<p>The only time she says non-math was creative was, &quot;My English classes were creative: my maths classes were often silent.&quot; But if you read on, it was still because creativity was social. &quot;People talking at me, rather than nutting things out with the person next to me, drove me crazy in my maths classes.&quot;<p>Nevertheless, the author found self-creativity in computing:<p>&quot;I had a male teacher give me a near-fail (pass minus I think it was called) when I built my first HTML site. He said I didn’t take the project seriously, and I said I wanted to be creative about it because it wasn’t challenging and technically I did nothing wrong – the code was perfect. If you didn’t want it fluro pink and with unicorns, then you should have said so. These days I would say “Write a better brief, dude.”&quot;<p>FURTHER CONSIDERATION<p>It&#x27;s reaching to extrapolate one person&#x27;s life to the whole population. Nevertheless, while there are numerous theories of why gender differences persist in STEM, education, etc., I personally am convinced significant statistical improvement in the gender balance in STEM could be made by emphasizing the social value of STEM fields.<p>If you are interested, others have claimed the social quality to be the <i>dominating</i> factor in the female participation across all undergraduate degrees. For instance:<p>“Research has shown that women tend to gravitate towards fields of studies and career paths where they can have a positive social impact and work with others, often collaboratively,” says Linda Basch, president of the National Council for Research on Women (NCRW). “This is why you see so many women in the fields of health care and education. When women do gravitate toward the sciences, it is usually the life sciences.”<p>Source (with interesting statistics of top 10 degrees by gender as well): <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women-forbes-woman-leadership-education.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/02/top-10-college-majors-women...</a>",1398740421

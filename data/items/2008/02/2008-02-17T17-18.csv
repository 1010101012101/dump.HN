People have impunity in their car. They holler things out the window they would never say to your face because they would receive a right cross in the snout. Your assertion that you would swear at me if I were running around with a sharp katana fails the common sense test in a big way.<p>Speaking of incompetence, there is a third type of troll. These trolls manner of speaking is seen as hostile by those who come from a more genteel social milieu. For example, in person as on the internet, they might tell you to STFU, or use words like shitpump, yet be trying to make a point in a friendly and helpful (perhaps playful) way.  You need not be an egghead to be abrupt. For an insight into this social milieu, see an episode of Trailer Park Boys. People need to learn to function differently on a forum, because it is a different social environment.",1203269790

To say something is undecidable is to make an objective claim.<p>However, at the point where you want to say someone should or should not do something the subjective morality comes back to bite you (saying curi's trick was underhanded).  I think this is curi's point.<p>All you can really do with subjective morality is describe your rationale for why you do what you do, and hope the other person buys it.  Even that is inconsistent because you are motivated by the thought that the other person should do something.<p>Curi, while it is true we start from first impressions, either our goals have to be mutually independent, or they must have a common foundation.  Otherwise they end up contradicting each other.  That's the point of moral philosophy, and what I meant by justifying moral intuition.",1203269105

They only spend energy describing things that they really need, and invariably, others need the same things.<p>The downside is that I never spend time working on my own pet projects.

They learned that you need to pay close attention to four things that usually go unnoticed:<p>1. Unchallenged orthodoxies—the widely held industry beliefs that blind incumbents to new opportunities.<p>2. Underleveraged competencies—the “invisible” assets and competencies, locked up in moribund businesses, that can be repurposed as new growth platforms.<p>3. Underappreciated trends—the nascent discontinuities that can be harnessed to reinvigorate old business models and create new ones.<p>4. Unarticulated needs—the frustrations and inconveniences that customers take for granted, and industry stalwarts have thus far failed to address.<p>original @ <a href=""http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/hamel/2008/01/innovation_hacker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/hamel/2008/01/innovation_ha...</a>)",1203267630

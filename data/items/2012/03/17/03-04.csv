3716324,comment,3716104,3716104,0,0,noPENGSinALASKA,,,"Well it seems like a great idea, yes, but in all reality it may cause some serious problems.  What exactly does <i>easily</i> enable root mean?  Will it essentially be a one click root built into the OS?  Personally, for my Nexus, it takes about 2 minutes to root.  All that has to be done is open the command pront/terminal and type a few words.  I actually just had to reroot after flashing the 4.0.4 update.zip.  I'm actually not too sure this is a great idea.<p><i>""Many of you may not give it a second glance, but among all the furor and concern about permissions requested by market apps and privacy, all Custom ROMs (CyanogenMod included) ship with one major security risk  root!""</i><p>Most anyone who is willing to root and ROM will be savvy enough to know how to avoid security issues and things like malware in non-market apps.  While I believe this is a good idea I am not sure how easily it can be implemented.<p>Knowing the CM team is pretty good gives me high hopes about this, but I am just curious how they plan on allowing everyone to root easily from within the OS.<p>Edit: Actually what they are doing makes sense. You don't run Linux as root all day.  I am just curious as to how they will easily allow root to be turned on and off.",1331956729

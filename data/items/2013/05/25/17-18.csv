The most effective methods are usually somewhere in the middle, and depend on the problem & team. Agree that bringing engineers into design/strategy/customer feedback is extremely important and much more effective than just open-plan offices.<p>When engineering, I personally enjoy spending 11 AM - 4 PM interacting with others and 4 PM - 8 PM locked up in a room working on code. I wish that switching around like that were an option in more offices.",1369504759

He tells people he likes building things because that seems to be a publicly acceptable rationale for building a tech companybut super secretly he just sees starting a tech company as a means to generating an inordinate amount of wealth quickly in a way thats more enjoyable than playing excel like a keyboard.</i><p>I think many or most of us, especially in YC circles, do start a company because we ""like building things"" -- not literally <i>just</i> that, but it's a part of our motivation or identity to get inherent pleasure from building things.  If you don't, though, I see no reason to fake it.  It may be cool and trendy to be a maker at heart, but it's certainly no prerequisite for starting a company.<p>We've really come full circle if we've gone from legitimizing and celebrating hackers and makers as founders to the point where people are posing as them to better fit a script.

Plus the number of rifles used is so small people who track of this sort of thing would likely have an idea if something weird was happening.<p>My only caveat is bodies found without a recovered bullet; almost all centerfire rifles have greater energies and sectional densities than normally used handguns, so the bullet is more likely to exit.  To get a handle on this we'd need breakdowns on where they happened (e.g. city, almost certainly a handgun, rural, a rifle is more likely, if only because of concealment issues).

5768079,comment,5758346,5758922,4,0,groovy2shoes,,,"As an Android user, the new Hangouts app that replaced the Talk app feels like one step forward and four steps back (in terms of UX).  The one step forward is that the chat windows look prettier.  The four steps back, from most annoying to least annoying:<p>1) Chat windows give me no indication of the presence of the other participant(s) in a conversation.  If they sign off, I have no idea they've signed off.  They frequently get messages from the tail end of a conversation much later, which is confusing for them.<p>2) The contact list is in alphabetical order, regardless of their presence.  Talk used to separate online contacts from offline ones.  This was nice because I have a lot of contacts in my gmail account, and only a dozen or so ever sign in to chat.  There's no obvious way to change the sort in Hangouts.<p>3) The UI is higher latency.  If I touch a notification in my tray, I often have to wait upwards of two seconds for the Hangouts app to load.  The various screens within the app also take longer to load.<p>4) I used to have a custom notification set when I received a message.  Hangouts replaced it with its own and there's no obvious way to change it back.<p>I hadn't noticed Hangouts had abandoned XMPP.  I find this rather unfortunate.  Adium on my Mac still connects fine, but for how long?",1369504658

5768066,comment,5767083,5767083,4,0,Camillo,,,"I get the impression that the author doesn't really understand why he's doing what he's doing. The obvious solution in this case is to have addHeader validate its arguments. The reason why you might want to have a separate class that does validation on construction is if you were going to end up validating the string multiple times: then you can just validate once in the constructor, and use the type system to ensure that each header string has been validated at least once.<p>But is that a realistic concern in this case? The author proposes replacing this:<p><pre><code>    response.addHeader(""Custom-Language"", \n                   request.getParameter(""lang""));\n</code></pre>\nWith this:<p><pre><code>    response.addHeader(new HttpHeaderName(""Custom-Language""), \n                   new HttpHeaderValue(request.getParameter(""lang"")));\n</code></pre>\nThis gives absolutely zero benefits over just doing the authentication in addHeader. Every string is still being validated the same number of times, but now the programmer is less productive and the code is more cluttered because of the added boilerplate.<p>There might be a slight advantage in saving the constant header name somewhere, and reusing it:<p><pre><code>    customLanguageHeader = new HttpHeaderName(""Custom-Language"");\n    ...\n    response.addHeader(customLanguageHeader, \n                   new HttpHeaderValue(request.getParameter(""lang"")));\n</code></pre>\nBut that's even uglier. What might be nice to have is a way to run the validation at compile time for static strings, so that you can save validation passes at runtime while still being able to use the literal ""Custom-Language"" at the location of the addHeader call. Automatic casting would also be nice, so that you can just pass the naked string for an HttpHeaderName parameter and the compiler will insert the constructor. But I don't think you can do these things in Java.<p>For this particular language and this particular problem, it may be best to have the Response object validate all headers while it's being serialized.",1369504495

The charitable view is they let you get up and running without needing to work out every little detail yourself. The uncharitable view is that they appear to work far more often than they actually work.<p>Because any invariants you may want them to have are ad-hoc, any error with those invariants can very easily slip by the programmer, the compiler, and the unit tests. Depending on what type of programmer you are, this can be The Father Of All Sins.<p>Strings are low-level. They're a half-step above binary streams. And because they're ubiquitous and all libraries work in terms of strings, there's active pressure against creating new types that represent the invariants and structure that your application may actually need, which often results in those invariants never even being thought through in the first place.<p>Again, it's subjective, and depends strongly on your opinion of Worse of Better. I agree that your thoughts on Inheritance. I think this problem is difficult to solve in a way that's not strictly worse than the original problem.

What people <i>complain</i> about is not necessarily an indication of what's <i>not working</i>.<p>My last two gigs have been open-plan, and I prefer it much more than closed-cube spaces. If your team is working as it should, and is in close proximity to project/product management, with a good process and a healthy level of trust between the stakeholders and between the various engineers, then in my experience open-plan is far better, because the quality of communication is high, the general focus of the team is high, and there's less background noise ""distraction"", because the cross-talk is usually relevant and on-task, and has a higher likelihood of being pertinent to the job at hand. Open plan offices work well when the team is already working well.<p>However, if there's broken processes, unfocussed coworkers, and a general level of distrust between team members or across teams, then the background chatter becomes exponentially more distracting and frustrating. Unfortunately most teams tend towards the latter and not the former.<p>In other words -- in my limited, anecdotal experience (last 5 years, two large open-plan teams; 10 years before that in closed or hybrid), high-functioning teams tend to thrive on the cross-talk and constant communication that open plan creates organically. Lower-functioning teams on the other hand have done better when the natural barriers of walls and closed doors limit unnecessary distractions and create healthier boundaries.<p>So it's not surprising to me that the study shows more instances of teams unhappy with open plans; it's certainly not for everybody.

I immediately thought, ""Wow... this would be much better as a Glass app that just puts a big X over every product you reach for whose purchase would support a company which acts in a fashion contrary to some user defined view! Or even if the product has ingredients that are incompatible with your child's allergies!""<p>And the app WOULD be better if it operated like that. The issue is that you can take that a step further right? You, as a manager in a corporation, could look at resumes and have a big X come up whenever you look at one from some guy with bad credit. Going even further you could have a big X come up whenever you look at one from a guy with questionable comments in the online forums he participates in. You see, he tried to hide behind pseudonyms, but it was all noodled out by a new service running ultra powerful analytics software on ultra powerful computing grids. Or the analytics service may go quantum, who knows? (And all that wouldn't even be necessary if your ISP is the same as the analytics service provider. Like if you use ... say ... Google Fiber.)<p>Material point is this...<p>now your job prospects have been impacted.<p>That's not all though...<p>You see, our hypothetical guys are, understandably, bummed about not getting that big job. So they go to the local bar to listen to a local band and relax for a while. Only the people in the bar see a huge ""KKK"" or ""New Black Panther"" label over the guy who made all the questionable comments on the internet. (Via a new dating service that most young women have decided they need because, let's face it, it's dangerous out there.) Don't misunderstand me, the service also operates in a good way. For instance, an ex-convict with the rape conviction would have VERY bad luck because the Glass would put an ""EX CONVICT: SEXUAL ASSAULT"" label over him.<p>The interesting thing, however, is this... wherever you are, these labels can potentially be displayed via facial recognition software combined with you telling your name to the guy looking at you through the Glass. The grocery store, the health club, your kid's school play, etc. All because of some comments you may have made on CNN forums a decade ago about say ... Hurricane Katrina victims. Or immigrants. Or white people. Or asians. Or men. You get the picture.<p>It's critical to realize one very important thing... and that is that there is no technology, in my limited recollection, that's ever failed to be developed on ethical grounds. This is why I tell young people whenever I get the chance, take great care in what you post on the internet. The content... even the TONE of the post could contribute to your ""profile summary"" in a detrimental fashion. This stuff really will affect your future a lot more than many people realize.

This is possible only when individuals are directly linked to world history and [dialogue*] arms itself to impose its own conditions.<p>Heidegger is a bit more optimistic, as he essentially must be:<p>""What is called thinking?"" At the end we return to the question we asked at first when we found out what our word ""thinking"" originally means. _Thanc_ means memory, thinking that recalls, thanks [interjecting ""Likes""!].<p>But in the meantime we have learned to see that the essential nature of thinking is determined by what there is to be thought about: the presence of what is present, the Being of beings. Thinking is thinking only when it _recalls_ in thought , That which this word indicates properly and truly, that is, unspoken, tacitly. And that is the duality of beings and Being.

Everywhere at once literally means a privileged reference frame. ""Over there, now"" is a concept with no logical meaning in our physical universe. Being in two places at once isn't physically impossible, it's just nothing.<p>And that imposes very serious constraints on God. If I am on the Earth and I pray for my husband on Mars, God on Mars <i>can not hear my prayer</i> until it is too late. You really think that's a statement most Americans agree with?<p>You're also off about light. Light is not ""everywhere at once from its own perspective"" as you seem to think. The fact that light <i>cannot</i> be everywhere at once is the same fact that dictates that light cannot <i>have</i> a point of view, that light experiences no time and has no perspective. (Mind you, if this is the comparison you would like to draw to God, I will happily assent.) Study up and be a bit more careful with your science, and you'll be able to throw much meatier punches theologically.",1369501551

It took a couple of weeks to get used to but I really like the open-plan.  I enjoyed being by myself at home alone tremendously and didn't miss the social interaction at all, since I IM with most of my friends anyway, but I have to say I do like the open-plan now.  My team is very social, I very much like everyone on the team, and I get to interact with my teammates a lot more, and if I need some solitude I can move to a smaller room (we're all laptop-based).<p>We do respect each other's space though, so most times it gets as quiet as a library, and even though my teammate is just on the other side of the table from me, he will IM me instead of just looking past the monitor and talk to me.  It's usually quiet, but closer to lunch or near the end of the day, we play StarCraft 2, start chattering a bit more, and it's generally a bit looser.<p>For the most part, we don't work remotely, but the VP of Engineering insists that if one of us is even possibly sick, to stay at home and not infect others.<p>It's definitely a different set of ""rules"", but I really do enjoy it.",1369501378

Some initial conclusions:<p>- We'd be wise to distinguish what we'd all <i>like</i> to have as an office from what actually functions best in a larger system. It is erroneous to think that simply because you like something means it's always the best policy for everybody. Sometimes local non-optimizations need to be made to optimize the system as a whole.<p>- Open-plan environments are nowhere near being a <i>determining</i> factor in team performance, but they can be an important add-on. So sure, if your company is too cheap for offices, treat teams like slaves, and just wants to cram as many people possible into the smallest space? Then that's going to suck. But that's going to suck anyway. I'd just be really careful about confusing ""stuff I think is cool"" from ""stuff that works the best for everybody concerned"" I'd also be careful about over-generalizing. A big hunk of this is team, project, company, technology, and building specific.<p>- As long as you're adapting, you could end up with any kind of office space. But just as an informed guess, co-located open plan is where I'd start, then adapt from there.<p>- The worse thing you can do is start with a pre-conceived notion of what works and didn't and then try to force reality to conform to it.",1369501345

But if that were really true, then a much more effective way to do that would be to include engineers in the design meetings, the customer feedback sessions, and strategy discussions.  In most open plans I've seen, the engineers sit together.  That doesn't sound like exposing them to the rest of the business.<p>But I think we're probably in violent agreement here.

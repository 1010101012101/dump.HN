6060578,comment,6060351,6060351,47,0,tikhonj,,,"Wow, this is pretty unfortunate. Also a very good example of why so many people maintain that Go is not nearly as statically typed as languages like Haskell or OCaml: casting (essentially subverting the type system) is very common, and limits most of the type system&#x27;s advantages.<p>In large part this is because Go&#x27;s type system is not very expressive. I would just like to point out that OCaml did the same things as Go (i.e. structural sub-typing). But with (global) type inference. And variants (including structural subtyping for those too). And generics (parametric polymorphism). Years before Go was developed.<p>In OCaml, this sort of thing probably would be <i>much</i> less likely to come up. After having used the OCaml object system a bit (but still more than most people!), I am actually very happy with it. It certainly has issues--oh boy, does it ever--but the issues are superficial. They are the result of very limited manpower in the project, not fundamental shortcomings of the design.<p>In OCaml, the compiler can figure out what methods you used without your telling it. So it would automatically realize that the function called the close method, and infer the appropriate type. You wouldn&#x27;t even have to write an interface (called a class type in OCaml) for it. If you <i>did</i> write an interface, but it did not expose a close method, the code would give you a type error.<p>I suppose you <i>could</i> try to do some sort of runtime casting and duck-typing, but I am not sure how. It would certainly not be a common thing to do, at all! Instead, the type would reflect exactly how the object is used in the function. It would be more explicit, more predictable and safer.<p>And, harping back on the same theme, it would be fully inferred for you.<p>The best of both worlds, really.",1374101940

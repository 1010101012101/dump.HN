It will already be too late in a few years when Tizen has proven itself (assuming that it does). As the saying goes, ""<i>there's no point closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.</i>"" And lets also remember that a threat doesn't mean actual damage - threats are warnings about the potential to do danger (and sometimes those warnings amount to little more than bluffs). So Tizen is already a threat, the question is whether Samsung manage to substantiate on that threat and carve a slice from Android's market share. And if Google want to ensure that doesn't happen then they need to already be acting rather than waiting until something does and then trying to react (just look at how well that strategy has worked out for Palm, Nokia, RIM/Blackberry and Microsoft).",1369126608

Everyone must be considered as an individual. We must respect their dignity and recognize their merit. They must have a sense of security in their jobs. Compensation must be fair and adequate, and working conditions clean, orderly and safe. We must be mindful of ways to help our employees fulfill their family obligations. Employees must feel free to make suggestions and complaints. There must be equal opportunity for employment, development and advancement for those qualified. We must provide competent management, and their actions must be just and ethical.<p>We are responsible to thecommunities in which we live and work and to the world community as well. We must be good citizens -- support good works and charities and pay our fair share of taxes. We must encourage civic improvements and better health and education. We must maintain in good order the property we are privileged to use, protecting the environment and natural resources.<p>Our final responsibility is to our stockholders. Business must make a sound profit. We must experiment with new ideas. Research must be carried on, innovative programs developed and mistakes paid for.

5742459,comment,5741231,5741598,2,0,EnderMB,,,"> Several years ago I was interviewing somewhere and Googled the job blurb. There were over 100 recruiters who had copied the job details from the company website and pretended it was their own client. (I checked with the company - they had in house recruiters and did not accept external ones - all those external ones were charlatans.)<p>I use LinkedIn, and have a personal website with my CV on it, and I experience this almost daily.<p>Recently, I've started keeping a list of all the recruiters that spam me or try to get in contact with me. I know quite a few of the companies in my area that are hiring so I usually run these names past people that work there and more often than not these recruiters will just scrape sites like Stack Overflow Careers to find companies that are hiring, only to sell people already on their books.<p>The worst I've experienced is when one of the large agencies in Bristol were hiring. My company received a phone call from a hurried man saying ""Something is wrong, I need to speak to EnderMB"". The second I picked up the phone, fearing the worst, this guy told me he was a recruiter and asked if I was happy at my job. After some harsh words he hung up, and then sent me a message on LinkedIn asking me to recommend other developers to him. Half an hour later, the phone rung again with someone saying that they needed to speak to someone else at the company. The boss gave the phone over, and it was the same guy again, doing the same thing to everyone in the company on my LinkedIn friends list. I checked with the hiring company and they'd blacklisted this guy and his company before, but they had tried to sell developers to him under another holding company.<p>Recruitment is entirely out of hand now. The only recruiters I've ever wanted to deal with are internal recruiters who seem to actually give a shit about getting good talent to their company.",1369125059

5742413,comment,5741823,5742191,5,0,svv,,,"> incredible track record of dead-wrong predictions<p>The Austrian School economics methodology does not allow for making predictions.  See e.g. the note at the beginning of <a href=""http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Austrian_predictions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Austrian_predictions</a>  It provides certain tools and models that one can use for explaining events and reasoning about policy options.  These reasoning can be used as a basis of predictions (along with the other, non-economics-theoretic assumptions), but the predictions themselves will fall outside of the economics science in the Austrian School sense.<p>Basically, if your analysis manages to reason away uncertainty of the future, you're not following Austrian methodology.  And no, the Austrian methodology won't even let you quantify that future uncertainty in probabilistic terms: that would only be possible if it used <i>causal</i> explanations of human action; instead, it relies on <i>teleological</i>, goal-oriented explanations.<p>Now, questioning and disputing the value, coherence and real-world applicability of the Austrian methodology is perfectly OK.  (Personally, I find the Austrian economists' disregard for formal notations very unfortunate, as I've mentioned in another discussion: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1647747"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1647747</a>)  Your comment, however, seems to be simply misguided, based on a flawed understanding of the issue, and the sarcastic tone is unlikely to facilitate a constructive discussion.<p>(Edited: spelling.)",1369123392
5742412,comment,5741823,5742324,15,0,gizmo,,,"""Austrian economics is tad stupid"" is the more correct choice. Austrian economics does not correspond with reality and is rightfully marginalized and ridiculed by the vast majority of economists.<p>In the 19th century we thought of inflation as the change in ratio of money to goods. Inject more money in the economy without a commensurate increase in the amount of goods and you get inflation. Take money out of an economy and deflation occurs. Now we know this isn't really accurate. Inflation happens not when there is more money in the economy but when more money is competing for the same goods. If money just sits in a bank account (or virtual bank account in the case of Diablo III) it doesn't really affect the economy and no inflation occurs. There is the same economic activity but a few rows in a database somewhere contain larger numbers.<p>This is also why in the real world the fed can triple the size of the money supply without causing inflation. Of course the austrians predict, over and over again, that runaway inflation is going to happen Any Time Now. But it doesn't and it won't.<p>Of course in a completely healthy economy you <i>would</i> expect an increase in the money supply to lead to an increase in economic activity and inflation, because in a healthy economy people spend and invest the money they have.<p>Austrian economics is about digging gold up from the ground, then smelting it into ingots and then burying those ingots again in a vault somewhere. Only through this mystical process can you get Real Money. Otherwise the money is ""fiat money"". It's so silly.",1369123380

First, lets backup though.<p>shawnc 19 hours ago | link | parent | flag<p><i>These are so amazing. The world wasn't sepia toned a hundred years ago! As silly as that statement is, my brain is actually having a hard time really believing these photos are from 100 years ago. I'm in awe.</i><p>OK. This was the original statement.  The somewhat minor but technical point I was making is as follows.  There is a simple explanation.  The world then looked like it does today. And the image itself is modern, so it looks modern. Thats it. The <i>Awe</i> of this?  Its called the ""uncanney valley"". Its kinda-almost-sorta-perfect-but-off-a-bit.<p>How did they do this then?  Easy, the colorwork is done in photoshop, using contemporary techniques. PS allows them to exploit the latent image data, and map it onto one of many ""style"" outputs. [1]<p>You can debate this or not. But its cited in the footnotes above.  If you havent read them, take a look.<p><i>I understand all of that</i> you say?<p>Ok.  You so, you are now in ""awe of photoshop"".<p>The technical reasons for this are not hard.<p>I'll stop here, because I think any more technical is not going to help you.<p><i>I've done a fair amount of photography...</i><p>Again, I would encourage you to do research on colour theory.  If you do your own work, it will help you immensely, to make the most of your images.  And if you really are an expert in this already, you know how trivial it is to produce ""contemporary"" style images from these formats, given the datasets you have to play with.<p>____________<p>Edit: For the general reader<p>[1] Style. In the sense i'm using it here is a mix of overall color, texture, tone, sharpness, saturation, hue, tint, noise, and other basic image editing techniques.  Without getting into a discussion about ""color"" (ie, not ""accuracy"" but more correctly temp, tint, gamut, etc), its important to understand that the ""look"" has a lot of potential. Think about instagram.  All of those filters are just ""style"" presets. But they don't look alike.  Some are contemporary, some are retro, etc.  It only requires a certain base image quaity to ""take"" the style (ie, good enough to not be ruined at the pixel level).  So you might have an image which out of iphone looks ""OK"" and then in instagram is ""Cool"" or whatever.  But the look of the ""instagram"" is independent of the landscape (which always looks the same, sepia toned on your phone or not).  Now, the question is, what limits the ""style""?  And thats where the color technicals come in.  If your input is messed up, your gamut and balance and tint will not let your image ""take"" a style.  Because the transitions (ie, curves, etc) will destroy your pixel base.  The size of your gamut, will determin the range you can execute.  Now, with film, the color-setting step is a one-shot deal. There are no 12 instagram settings - you get just one - film/chemistry setting.  You gett a little bit of flex at the print (color mix, etc) but not much. If you <i>scan</i> the film, then you are opening up to 12 syles (or whatever).  So, now we get to the point.  None of the film emulsions (prior to NC portra) really give you a contemporary look.  To get that, you have to bring the image into <i>digital</i>. The temp/tint/contrast levels are just not there.  Thats why its ""odd"" seing an old image looking like NC portra film or like a 2000+ PJ photoshop.  And you can double check by looking at the details, if your an expert. The monochrome seperations have good tonal information, which is a credit to the guys back 100 years ago.

  [[ Albums have artists too ]]
</code></pre>
Albums often have a person that mixes songs together. In ID3v2 series we use a tag  ""TPE2"". Early ID3v2 adopters used ""TXXX ALBUM ARTIST"" and ""TXXX ALBUMARTIST"" as originally TPE2 was reserved for Band definition. iTunes and WMP both standardized on TPE2 for album artist.<p>Armin Van Buuren - State of Trance v561- #2 - Artsy - Open Space<p><pre><code>  TPE1 (song author) - Arsty
  TPE2 (album author) - Armin Van Buuren
  TALB (album title) - State of Trance v561
  TRCK (track number) - 2
</code></pre>
TPE2 typically comes in use with TCMP designating that a song is a compilation. (Before TCMP became standard, people also used ""TXXX COMPILATION"").<p><pre><code>  --
  [[ You need multiple versions of songs ! ]]
</code></pre>
Most programs automating software will ask which version of album it is.<p>For example, Pendulum band released album ""Hold Your Color"" in 2005. <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Pendulum-Hold-Your-Colour/release/494991"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.discogs.com/Pendulum-Hold-Your-Colour/release/494...</a><p>However, in 2007 the rereleased the album, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Pendulum-Hold-Your-Colour/release/1345228"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.discogs.com/Pendulum-Hold-Your-Colour/release/134...</a><p>The last two songs differ.  You need to pick right year to ensure you tag them properly.<p>Alternatively, the year could foretell how remastered the song is.  Is this original compression, or the new louder version? See Loudness war article.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war</a><p><pre><code>  --
  [[ date/year is screwed up -- agreed ]]
</code></pre>
We have to differentiate three types of dates:<p>When song was recorded -- aka: This song was released in 1994<p>When album compilation was released -- aka: the best of 90s was released in 2005<p>What decade the song is trying to recapture -- aka: the song feels like music from the 60s<p><pre><code>  --
  [[ Genres / taggins is a solution -- although at time blunt ]]
</code></pre>
Genres were terrible in old ID3v1, where we were locked to 127 genres.<p>In ID3v2 we can enter whatever we want into genre, and store multiple of them. Good taggers read data off Last.fm / discogs / music brainz enter complete information about songs. This includes tags detailing genre, instruments, style, moods, decades.  Certain players, like XBMC can use style and moods. Some systems like discogs even support hierarchal tags (see their style vs genre).",1347160596

Keep one yourself and give another to your friend.<p>* Now you have two qubits; one entangled with your friends and one that you want to transmit.<p>* Send your two bits through a quantum circuit (the main part being a 'controlled NOT gate').<p>* Your bit is now entangled with the bit that is entangled with your friends bit.<p>* Measure each of your bits, hence 'collapsing' them. Each measurement gives you a classical bit.<p>* Transmit your two classical bits to your friend over any classical connection.<p>* Your friend then performs an operation on his or her qubit depending on what you send him or her.<p>* Your friend's qubit is now in the state that your original qubit was in. Your original qubit is now in a different state.<p>Call it teleporation if you want; it's not that unlike some sci-fi teleportation constructs of 'beaming' things places.<p>Why bother with this?<p>* It lets you send qubits to distant places that you have only classical channels to (and previously close enough contact share two entangled qubits).<p>* It allows more error-resistant computations: if your qubit is difficult to construct and you wish to perform a difficult operation on it, you can actually have your friend perform the difficult operation on his or her bit  - <i>prior</i> to teleportation - and, if it succeeds, you can then proceed with the teleportation. If it doesn't succeed, your friend may try again on another entangled qubit without messing up your difficult-to-prepare qubit. After a success and teleportation, you get the same result (up to a commutator which is usually relatively small and risk-free) as performing the difficult operation on the difficult-to-prepare qubit, but with less risk of messing it up.",1347160286

Since a well-done adventure game <i>should</i> still be appealing even years after its original release, one approach would be to backport engine improvements to their older games in order to make them more attractive to long-tail customers. You might think of this as ""we're selling stories, not engines."" A more traditional approach (still employed by many Japanese developers) is to wait for a significant hardware or platform update and re-release the game, usually (but not always) updating the visuals or enhancing the interface, often several times, in hopes of milking fans dry with minimal effort (lazy ports) or risk (updated rereleases of games they already know people will buy). With the success of iOS and Android as continuously improving platforms in contrast to traditional static consoles, we may see less of the latter strategy in coming years.<p>On the other hand, Activision's Call of Duty series has been very successful sticking to an unquestionably franchise-oriented approach. Each game is basically the same as every other one before it, dressed up in a slightly different coat of paint, with slightly tweaked gameplay mechanics, etc, yet people enthusiastically plop down $60+ for every new release. Activision has no incentive to backport their engine improvements to their older titles because they want people to move on to the latest and greatest installment, and no one wants to buy the old installments anyways -- no one actually wants Modern Warfare 1, 2, or even the latest installment of today, specifically. They just want access to the latest iteration of the Call of Duty formula and all of its players, and they're willing to pay $60+ every year to do so.",1347159699

I can't program OOP worth shit.
I understand it is a failing of mine, and not OOP.<p>I get procedural, but not OOP.<p>Yes, yes.. I can create a car class and instantiate it, and compose an engine that is part of the car class, as the usual examples of OOP for idiots like me go.<p>But when it comes to real, actual, practical OOP programming, I would rather find myself rolling around in steaming goat feces than figure out what a generic collection is or what a Visitor Pattern is.<p>Is there any hope for me?<p>None, right?<p>I will stick to janitorial work, yes?<p>Thank you kindly, dear sirs and madame.",1347159658

313195,comment,312331,312877,0,0,Flemlord,,,"Hilarious. You're assuming the DOJ is actually trying to prevent monopolies; it seems to me their main motivation is responding to pressure from Congress and corporate lobbyists. If Apple were called into their offices to defend their market share, they would say something like ""we have .001 percent of the mobile devices market. This market includes anything with a wireless connection, like laptops and all cellular phones."" The DOJ would say ""Ok, sounds good to us. No monopoly issues here."" (Unless, of course, some powerful Congressperson was pounding on them, trying to cause headaches for Apple..)<p>As an example, the DOJ just let the only two satellite radio companies merge (Sirius and XM). They allowed them to define the market as ""anything that can broadcast music"". The market included all normal over-the-air radio stations, internet radio, and (for all I know) iTunes. By that definition, XM and Sirius only owned .01% of the ""anything that can broadcast"" market, so there were no antitrust issues.<p>I got a personal look at this when I sold my last company; we were bought by a competitor and the DOJ called us in to evaluate the merger and determine whether there were any anti-trust issues. We defined the market in the broadest terms possible and got absolutely no resistance from them. (Granted, even had we defined the market in narrow terms we still should have been ok.) To this day I'm amazed at how tractable they were.<p>The system is broken.",1222231638

The term ""rational"" has no solid foundation. Quite possibly believing yourself to be rational is at best extremely irrational.<p>Also keep in mind that the assumption that other people expect and reward what they consider to be rational behavior from you is not always true.<p>If you define ""rational"" to be cold logic that ignores human feelings and passions, then it is weakly defined and it is not going to make you friends (if you consider making friends to be a rational thing to do). Ultimately you could postulate that human feelings eventually boil down to cold logic, but unless you can calculate that in your head you're left with heuristics.",1222230581

313178,comment,311835,313073,0,0,sidsavara,,,"You bring up an interesting point about individuals versus businesses. I think one of the key differences here is that I <i>don't</i> want to work lots of overtime in order to make up the monetary difference to pay for food being delivered to my house - it comes out of the same bucket that eating out, movies etc would come out of.  So in the end, it's true, I would have net more money if I cooked at home - but ~10 hours less time, regardless of hourly rate<p>I remember a friend of mine who would wash her car herself to save money. I know some people care for cars a lot and wash their car themselves because they enjoy it and they take pride in it - that's a whole separate class of utility and enjoyment. She was just washing it to keep it clean.  She made well over 6 figures, and she could have driven it through a car wash for 7 bucks and have it done in 5 minutes.  I remember reading an article that basically said we get attached to things we have - including money, and we value it more because it is ours. Perhaps that also partially accounts for the psychological disconnect between the way businesses act (when it's the company's money, and not their own) versus individuals.",1222230226

I had (sadly) never considered just writing as if your DSL already existed, then go back and actually implement it.<p>This is great, because what you write initially is basically what you need to implement your DSL via TDD. In this case the code written in the DSL represents your unit tests for the code implementing the DSL.<p>Now I just need a project I can try this on. Not sure why I never tried it that way before.

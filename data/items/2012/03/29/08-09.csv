Should I be focusing my attention on getting funding for my ideas or helping someone else. Finance or Wage?<p>There is a lot of advice on the net about startup this, and seed round that, and all sorts of blah blah blah about products and pivoting and something to do with hockey sticks. Most of it is plain common sense. But there is one recurring theme that cuts through all of it.<p>It doesn't matter what your idea is or how skilled your team is, when someone hands over a few hundred thousand dollars, they are investing in you, not your product. Sure, your idea is great, but can you ""make it happen"". In essence ""You"" are the product, not your idea.<p>So, my question is, would you invest in me as a product? I do have some prototypes. Should I just say screw it and blatantly ask rich people for money?<p>Am I investable?<p>Thanks for listening.

There isn't a problem I can't find the cause of or a workaround for.<p>= Current Activities =\nLearning the complete Web 2.0 stack. Aside from being able to build the machines for 20+ years, I can now install CentOS 5 in my own VPS running WHM/cPanel. This platform provides me with Web Hosting, DNS, Email and other funky stuff like node.js. Using those tools, I have now built 15 websites of which 5 are ""Apps"" running on Expression Engine and Bootstrap. They all include the basics: Analytics by two different services, Social Media, Search, proper Content Management and are responsive in mobile environments.",1333011317

There are fairly straightforward methods to get that much in a month (a salaried job), a week (contracting+), or a day (training event, $500 a head).<p>+ Stipulate that in addition to Rails he has at least one talent which makes money and this is not unreasonable at all.<p>b) There was no time at which OSS was not predominantly the work product of the global rich employed at corporations.

Apps running on Rails go from BCC (five figures a year) to Basecamp (eight figures a year and will probably hit nine eventually unless they already did).<p>d) OSS developers making money by it - I.e. The traditional accepted way to write it - does not make you personally worse off, because it increases software available to you.  You may perceive that people will listen to you less because monied interests will drown out your voice.  This is irrational: since the $100 you think is a lot of money only buys maybe 30 minutes of programmer time anyhow, the opinions that mattered in OSS were already those of companies which coul actually pay salaries, and someone freer with their last $100 than you are will only have epsilon more impact on ""the community"" than you when compared to IBM (a consulting company which staffed most Linux development) or Google (an advertising company which directly or indirectly pays the salaries of the majority of programmers working on either of the two big OSS browsers.) apache's Kickstarter was IBM realizing that they'd happily pay a billion dollars to have IIS not become the dominant server platform <i>so they proceeded to do so</i>.",1333008897

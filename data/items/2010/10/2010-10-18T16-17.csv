1804178,story,,,22,28,traderjoe,"Ask HN: Save my dying Startup",,"Dear HNers, I am writing this post in hopes of getting some help on saving my startup which is slowly decaying before my eyes; countless hours of work, tens of thousands of dollars spent, and a ton of sacrifice just dying. There is a wealth of knowledge that exists at HN and I’m hoping some folks can steer me in the right direction with my dying startup because at this point I’m not sure what to do? About three years ago, my friend and I thought up an idea for creating a ""social network for traders."" He had worked in finance for one of the biggest forex brokers and was a trader of foreign exchange. A few months into his work, he realized that this company, with its millions of clients, was missing a critical component that clients constantly kept asking about ""can I communicate with other clients regarding certain positions or trends in the market?"" Coming from a web development/IT background,  I immediately got to work on creating a small prototype of what we both envisioned to be a forum for currency traders to come and discuss their strategies, trades, tips and suggestions on choosing brokers, etc. etc. The website was simple but as we put more effort into it, we realized there wasn’t any real competitor to a website that caters to an international community of traders at all. We figured our ideas are on a much bigger scale and we decided to proceed further and bring our ideas to fruition. What started as a hobby and then a venture soon turned into a business. Six months into it, we picked up an angel investor overseas (coincidentally, one of my buddy’s clients who was interested in such an idea). As money rolled in, web development expanded dramatically. We outsourced all the dev work to India, having two firms work around the clock, we hired mathematicians to help with formulas, and hired graphic artists. We managed teams of workers and went through countless design phases and formula tweaks. The overall premise of the site expanded from a simple forum to a world wide community, where traders can interact and compete with other traders by predicting the weeks end financial markets. Today, our weekly competitions, allow traders to pick from various local or world markets, and try to predict how that respective market will close. Besides forex, we include other markets such as futures, U.S. markets and world markets. Each prediction is graded based on a unique scale according to our internal algorithm. The scale ""tiers"" are provided on the website in layman’s terms to make the user understand how he can earn or lose virtual dollars (which in turn, can be redeemed for real-world prizes). In the short team, the momentum was flowing and we were convinced that we were on the up and up. We had enough money for development and knew what we needed to spend to get to where we wanted to be. Then in 2009, our investor backed out half way into the process leaving us with no money left for marketing (we originally wanted to leave 60% for marketing and advertising). Today, we still believe in our idea but ever since the money dried up, we found ourselves not being able to market the website properly and in turn leaving it stale and hope that word-of-mouth will help. Development is more or less complete and we have active users trading but the momentum is gone and in a way so is our motivation. The easy answer is to say ""keep working at it"" but it is difficult especially when time is so valuable (we are in our late 20’s and life is becoming more challenging i.e. jobs, women, money, etc.). What does an aspiring entrepreneur do now knowing that his idea can still work but has no motivation to continue without short-term incentives?",1287420528

I hadn't really thought much about this, but while contributing to a benchmark yesterday (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1800396"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1800396</a>), it wound up staring me in the face. There's actually surprisingly little difference performance-wise in running Lua from source vs. precompiled (both pretty fast), whereas the difference between Python and pyc in my benchmark was wider than every other possible pair in the chart except python interpreted vs. ""echo Hello World"". (I didn't have any JVM languages, though.)<p>I don't really do eval-based metaprogramming in Python, but do so on occasion in Lua. I thought I felt better about doing so because Lua is syntactically much simpler (and has scoping rules that make avoiding unexpected variable capture easy), but the Lua compiler itself also appears to be substantially faster than Python's. (It doesn't do much analysis, but still usually runs faster than Python.)<p>And yes, it's not as good as straight-up Lisp macros, but Lua's reflection also covers a lot of low-hanging fruit that macros would otherwise handle. The biggest thing lacking in Lua compared to Lisp is an explicit compile-time phase for static metaprogramming. (Code generation is an inferior alternative.) Lisp macros win big in part because they can avoid the overhead of parsing, but parsing Lua is fairly cheap thanks to its small, LL(1) grammar (<a href=""http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#8</a>).",1287420363

Insofar as you can ""own"" a bunch of addresses, the companies and organizations with legacy allocations really do <i>own</i> them, and I suspect many of them (the ones that haven't voluntarily given them up already) probably aren't interested in giving them up and might decide to fight back.<p>Look over a list of Class As and tell me which you'd like to take on in court.<p>Obviously they could be bribed into giving those addresses up, if someone wanted to cover the cost of switching ... but if you're going to spend the money, there are probably better things you could do to spur IPv6 adoption than spend it on corporate networks with a well-defined upgrade policy.  You'd probably do better to work with the big residential ISPs, or maybe with the wireless carriers, since that's where a lot of the new demand growth is.<p>The legacy allocation ship sailed a long time ago, and there are better things we can do now than try to chase it down and board it by force.",1287420250

They have their pick of applicants because the jobs are well-paid, and offer fantastic benefits, one of which is the chance to live abroad in the various countries served by El Al. Housing and stipend paid for.<p>I understand that much of what El Al does for security screening amounts to racial profiling.

But for the UI having self encapsulated widgets that can be extended to add distinct functionality is far superior to procedural, functional or declarative. Having a select box that can be extended to create a filtering select box with only the functionality for filtering needed is a no brainer. As well having the UI elements functionality represented by a distinct object helps isolate that code and functionality away from the larger system, with a defined interface so that it can be reused as needed without external dependencies. OO manages the hierarchy of code and its bisection in a manner that is far more comprehensible when it comes to UI, AI and game development. The rest is just preference.",1287419741

(technically there is probably a third which is just a hack).<p>I don't think that these two programmer see eye to eye. One looks to apply the chains of functions to a problem to simplify the task at hand. While the other looks to creatively attack the problem with a minimalistic approach to writing code. They find beauty in recursion and abstraction, through interfacing things so that common logic can provide different results based on plug-able interfaces.<p>They are different mind sets entirely, where one looks to reuse existing library code the other looks to not write as little code as possible through creativity.  Both are very valid programmer types and both can achieve mastery, it is more just a matter of how ones mind works. I myself am the latter, I love abstracting problems away till they just seem to disappear. I love closures and delegates, interfaces and anonymous functions. These are my utensils of mastery.<p>One thing I have noticed though is that programmers tend to work better with other programmer of the same type. For most of my career I have worked with the same development team. Many of the guys I trained and then they trained others. We are like a caravan of programming gypsies one of us would find a position at a start-up or find backing and the rest would follow in time.<p>Anyway, after the sale of the last company we where at I had to go out and find a real job. I did, and the entire team was of the other type it seems that they had amassed in a similar fashion as my group of developers and ended up there. Anyways, I have to say, for the first time in my life I was a drag on the team it just seemed that my code and their code just never jived, i mean it all worked properly but when I would have to work on one of their code or they would have to work on my code it was just hours of lost productivity. I eventually resigned because it was clear that for the first time in my life I was not working out as a developer. I was just mediocre at doing it there way.<p>Anyway, just food for thought, maybe you are like me Daniel and see the elegance of code. While the other guy sees the robustness.",1287419206

1804014,comment,1803488,1803529,0,0,jcroberts,,,"cperciva, there are actually two common scams involving charities and paypal. The first is the risk of people donating to fake charities as you mentioned. The second is the risk of criminals using stolen credit cards to make donations to charities; in other words, testing to see if the stolen credit card information is usable. The headaches caused to charities are very painful, prolonged and costly (charge backs).<p>There are other similar and/or related scams involving ""charities"" (both legitimate and fake) but I feel this is the wrong place to discuss them.<p>The trouble the OP has with ""donations"" to an open source project tend to be very common with paypal and they often result in a false-positive in the paypal ""fraud detection"" (risk management) analysis. I know of one example where a prominent OpenBSD developer needed some fast hardware. He does full builds of the entire ""ports"" tree (i.e. all software ported to OpenBSD), so buying powerful (read: expenseive) hardware was really needed. One person stepped up with a donation/gift of the needed funds, and sent the payment through paypal...<p>The first thing that happened is the donor got a call from paypal because the donation triggered a false-positive in their ""fraud detection"" analysis. It might seem like an annoyance, but this is actually a good thing.<p>The next thing that happened is, the donor got a call from the credit card department of his bank, mainly because he used only a credit card with paypal. Yep, there was another false-positive alert on the fraud detection system of his bank.<p>During these two false-positives, the paypaly account of the open source developer receiving the funds was locked. In this case, the mistaken lock was resolved very quickly due to the two separate phone calls, but it was still a pain in the ass.<p>There is hope. The way to get around the paypal ""requirement"" of an open source project needing to be a vetted and registered 501(3)(c) organization in the US (or equivalent in other countries) is to have the payments classified as a ""gift"" rather than a ""donation"" in paypal parlance.",1287418336

        def h(*args, **kwargs):
            return g(f(*args, **kwargs))
        # fix up h.__doc__ and friends
        return h
</code></pre>
or simply<p><pre><code>    (lambda the, args: g(f(the, args))(x, y)
</code></pre>
(don't remember comp's semantics, is (comp f g) = f o g or g o f?)<p>too long; don't read:<p>Decorators are certainly cool, but semantically they represent something more like a pattern than a FP construct.  A decorator represents something you might want to do to lots of functions, a property you want all instances of a function to have without writing it explicitly into each function.  Function composition is more along the lines of having two functions which are interesting on their own, but which sometimes you want to compose.<p>With decorators, it would also be awkward to compose multiple functions.  Observe:<p><pre><code>    def compose_with(g):
        def decorator(f):
            def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
                return g(f(*args, **kwargs))
            return decorated_function
        return decorator

    def h(x): math.sqrt(x)

    @compose_with(h)
    def g(x): 2 * x

    @compose_with(g)
    def f(x): x + 1
</code></pre>
versus (for some reasonable definition of apply...)<p><pre><code>    def compose(*fns):
        def composition(*args, **kwargs):
            return reduce((lambda computed, next_fn: next_fn.apply(computed)),
                          fns,
                          (args, kwargs))
        return composition

    # define fns as above without decorator
    hogof = compose(f, g, h)</code></pre>",1287417600

3962696,comment,3962129,3962518,7,0,pjscott,,,"> Rule of law makes countries rich. Rule of law foster cooperation and trust in societies. People can trust authorities and each other.<p>I don't think that part of your thesis is too controversial. The big idea of common law, for example, is that courts try to make their decisions reasonably consistent with previous decisions, not because they think that this will necessarily lead to the best decisions each time, but because this makes the law predictable. Predictable laws are an important part of a good business environment.<p>(Laws with low overhead are also important, mind you. This is why an AP1000 nuclear power plant made in China costs so much less than one built in the US or Europe, even though it's the same damn plant. The overhead of dealing with the government in a very heavyweight regulatory environment is a huge factor in cost and speed.)",1336795034

Big and old and supposedly ""successful"" and supposedly run by very smart people who deserve very high pay because what they're doing is very hard and technical, and only they know how to manage resources efficiently, unlike say the government. Let's not even get into the paychecks of all the CEO's, traders, partners, huge sums of money for what in many cases involves just hiring other people and telling them what to do, pointing out the obvious, etc. Meanwhile the little people, the people that do the vast majority of the real and necessary work in our communities --- teachers, doctors, repairmen, cops, firefighters, road crew, waiters, delivery folks, carpenters, electricians, etc. --- get the least amount of pay. Because that's ""efficient"". If that's an efficient allocation of resources, maybe that's a bad thing.<p>I think we agree on the idea that government should be small, or at least as small as possible. And we agree on the roles it should play. But I don't buy into the argument that government is inherently bad at allocating resources efficiently and private businesses are inherently good.

When I was building the IT infrastructure for SSN, I ran the company's IT and it's dozen employees on a $75 linksys (and a half-dozen Poweredge Dell Server) for the first 5-6 months.  Eventually, we grew to around 20 employees, picked up a data center colo-cabinet for our customer apps and needed a bit more robustness, so I purchased a $300 used Cisco 2621xm, a couple T1 WICs for $500, and ran the company for the next year on that 3 mbit pipe - the company got to around 50 employees before we moved.  For the first two years of its life I spent a grand total of $875 on routing hardware and 50 employees were able to get their work done (including code pushes to our data center) over that 3 mbit pipe.<p>When I handed over network engineering, though, our last purchase order for networking equipment (with around 500 employees) - was north of $500K (including very hefty Cisco Discounts) (This isn't including the Data Center infrastructure - by then we had colo space in three data centers - just the corporate infrastructure for three buildings)<p>It's hard to explain without living through it - but the decisions that make sense when you are small, and you aren't paying your network engineers $150K/year (fully loaded), and you aren't trying to figure out how to handle pager duty, and warehouse and deal with RMAs, and support various types of hardware, and worry about rotating inventory, and dealing with upgrade cycles, and manage security, and patch levels, and remote administrations - not even considering future feature enhancements and performance (75 mbits sounds great today - but what about the future?) - when you get to scale, the CapEx (the capital cost of the hardware) starts to have fewer consequences on a technology investment (particularly over 10 years) than the other elements.  Not to mention that there are also political issues (Layer 8) associated with differing levels of services/features for small population centers versus large population centers.<p>Yes - this does result in seemingly ludicrous situations like a 4 computer library being run on a ISR capable of running 350 mbits/second without breaking a sweat - but in 5-8 years from now, some technology administrator for the state will take over that infrastructure, and I can guarantee you that they won't be thinking ""My God, we're over provisioned on our networking equipment"" - but instead, ""Thank goodness I have a few more years of runway before we have to replace all this gear.""<p>I realize I haven't fully fleshed out the argument as to why it might make sense to put these hefty branch routers into smaller locales, but hopefully it doesn't sound silly.<p>Hey - at least they didn't roll out 6509s in all these libraries.

With a VM, you can track the continuation by simple stack operations rather than furiously allocating JS closures. Think about the effect in memory: when you do a return in a VM, you just pop some stuff off the stack(s) and there is no closure left hanging around for the GC to collect.<p>The Dybvig ""Three implementations of scheme"" paper presents a really nice VM and Norvig's PAIP book presents a nice simple compiler for Scheme. Those are the two main sources that I've used for my simple compiler.<p>Edit: Also...<p>> I lose all the benefits of JIT-ed Javascript if I run it in a VM.<p>But if you are using CPS, then your JS functions are going to be really small and the JIT won't have much to work with, right? It's not clear to me that the JIT will be more effective working on CPS JS given that you want to have fine-grained continuations for debugging.",1336792437

It's what THEY claim their interests are. I'm sorry, but if you claim to vote to a party because ""they believe in small government"", despite the last 30 years of data showing that government & expenses grow under said party control much more than under the other party's control, then you are not smart.<p>The specific example I gave was of JtP, who was (for a short time) a hero and looked upon figure in a section of the population. His vote and declared interests (as declared by himself) do not align, and his reasoning is flawed. And unfortunately, that is extremely common.<p>> Are people who vote 'for their interests' (that is, for what you believe their interests are) but can't articulate why also stupid?<p>I don't know. Do you? I mean, you might be doing ""the right thing"" for the right reasons, in which case you are not stupid, and you might be doing the right thing for the wrong reasons, in which case you are stupid (but lucky). I was discussing cases in which there is apparent evidence for improvement of outcome.<p>> is there any reason he can't make the same argument as you from his reverse perspective?<p>No, he can (and should) make the same arugment about me, making me non stupid but working against my interests from his perspective. Which is a base for discussion - he might convince me (or might not, or we might agree to disagree), and find some way to work together.<p>e.g. one might believe that government should backstop failing banks, and one might not. There might be evidence one way or the other, but probably not conclusive evidence. Either one of us may believe the other is working against his interest. And neither of us will really be wrong.<p>> and just say 'people who can't soundly reason about their votes are stupid' - something relatively uncontroversial.<p>That's actually what I was trying to say. I was just focusing about the thing that highlights a subset of those people: working against their own interests. NOT what I believe their interests are (that's what you assume, but never have I said that), but about what they declare their interests to be (I should have been more clear about that).",1354920419

Second, the codes actually have measures to prevent ""moral panic"" in them, in the form of getting both sides of the story, and in the case of pycon, using some form of consensus technique to discuss the ramification/consequences. This doesn't mean expulsion, it could simply mean a warning or a requirement to stay away from the reporter. These are reasonable reasonable responses to unwanted continued/""forced"" discussion in an elevator.<p>Further should overreaction occur, there will in fact be backlash against the conference and organizers. This is the internet. You know it is true.<p>And no it isn't comparable to privacy concerns. It is comparable to people rejecting theft laws because consequences for a wrong action are unfair and someone could be framed.

There can be reasoned discussion about actual penalties being too harsh or not harsh enough, but railing against the existence of such laws only benefits thieves.",1354920418

4889640,comment,4888731,4889347,4,0,rwg,,,"Many reasons (very incomplete list):<p>- There is <i>significantly</i> less spectrum available for upstream channel use than downstream channel use.  (Something like 37 MHz vs. 500-800 MHz.)  This means cable operators have to be very frugal with upstream channel allocations and can't reasonably bond together enough upstream channels w/ DOCSIS 3.0 to give everyone symmetric up/down speeds.<p>- Upstream channels are a shared medium using TDMA (time division), which introduces overhead to prevent multiple transmitters (cable modems) from transmitting on top of one another.  However, even if your cable modem was the only device on the network, it wouldn't get all of the available upstream timeslots for sending data.<p>- Upstream channels use a less spectrally efficient modulation scheme than downstream channels in order to keep bit error rates low.  (The upstream channels are noisier than the downstream channels.)

French and Russian were used in the mathematics, but even there, mathematical papers are being published largely in English nowadays as much as possible, even if the author is a native speaker of another language.<p>The reason this is practical is because the sciences all speak their own language anyway. Every chemist, regardless of their native language, knows that this expression[2] denotes the combustion of propane. Likewise, mathematics uses its own symbols and relationships.<p>I remember the story of someone - perhaps Erdos? - co-authoring a paper with another mathematician, despite neither of them speaking a single natural language in common.<p>A well-written computer program may have English identifiers for variable names, but this is really cosmetic more than anything else. (If you don't believe me, go ask your lexer!) Don't confuse the fact that we usually attach English identifiers to variable/function names with the myth that our programming languages are somehow ""English"" in nature.<p>[1] An ironic term in this case, for sure!<p>[2] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/7/6/a76ae3507ba0d03474726055fc8924a4.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/7/6/a76ae3507ba0d03474726...</a>",1354919021

One of the core things to understand is that this is not an irrational fear at all.

Assuming the generator is 50% efficient (that is a really good generator) that is about .025 Watts to run your LED. So can you get decent light from an LED with 25 mWatts?

5626948,comment,5625044,5625538,4,0,toyg,,,"<i>> I think EU law puts the onus on the person disposing electronic goods rather than the producer.</i><p>Nope, I'm pretty sure it's the opposite. At any point in time, if you want to dispose of some electronic gadget in the EU, you can send it to the manufacturer for disposal, and sue them if they refuse. If the manufacturer does not have a local branch, then the onus is on the importer/distributor down the chain.<p>Unfortunately, most people don't know or simply can't be bothered.<p>I used to just drop stuff at the local skip/recycling centre, where they keep electronics in a separate area, because I knew people would scavenge it for parts; a few months ago the skip changed their policy and now forbid people from picking up anything from the ""electronics area"", under some health&safety-touting rule. I bet it's actually because electronics disposal in the EU is now big business, thanks to the above-mentioned directive: producers are now under de-facto blackmail, so they pay specialised companies to deal with their waste, which in turn rely on local skips to pick up stuff. These companies need to get hold of waste to get paid, so they basically stop people from recycling at the source. Politically speaking it's mission accomplished (establishing a ""green"" economy etc etc), but in practice it's actually discouraging people from recycling among themselves, which is the most energy-efficient way to tackle waste; and recyclable electronics still show up in non-diversified skips across the African continent (or worse).",1367251014

It's been a very long time since I saw software development technology that wasn't just the application of something developed in the 1960's through 1980's. ""Oh, Java has lambdas now? Here are the design patterns that take advantage of them. They were well-understood in 1975."" ""Oh, Ruby has generational garbage collection now? Here is the paper describing the performance characteristics of that--from 1984.""<p>I think TypeScript is actually one of the more genuinely interesting developments recently--it's state of the art circa 1996 (Abadi and Cardelli's ""A Theory of Objects."")<p>This is not really a dig at software development. There is, for example, very little in aerospace that has changed more than incrementally since the 1970's. But people have this perception of software development as this rapidly changing field where knowledge becomes obsolete in the course of a couple of years, when in reality the basic principles are really quite well-developed and mature. Keeping up with software development technology is mostly a matter of figuring out how people have gussied up old ideas with new syntax.<p>All of the interesting stuff now is domain specific. Algorithms for self-driving cars? Yeah, that's something that we didn't have 20 years ago.",1367250489

The project is many years old via several pivots, it started out as an email anonymizer > rss transform aggregator when I was going through a semantic web phase. I'm not sure of Pipes underlying implementation, but Bipio uses a (distributed) digraph to process channels/functions with virtually limitless complexity.  Others on the market seemed locked into a simpler functional predicate.<p>Bipio is geared towards the sweet spot of developer flexibility and non-developer productivity, so the problem I'm trying to solve is 'how do I give programmer flexibility to users who don't care (or have need to care) about programming'. You can get as much under the hood of Bipio as you want, or use a very highly abstracted UI, which I'm still building, to just get stuff done.  A fundamental difference beyond the open API is the ability to power a web application, or be an email gatekeeper, or content aggregator etc. or model very complex pipelines easily.  I have someone using it to sell .psd templates on etsy straight from dropbox, completely hands off, which was a really interesting use case (and a 30 minute setup all things considered including testing).<p>Given enough interest, it will likely progress to an open source model circa Wordpress, so I can really start concentrating and understanding the human interaction side of these types of services.<p>Thanks for the feedback! :)",1367250273

I actually upgraded because my 2011 model was getting these freezes, and I assumed it was a hardware problem.<p>But my new MBP has been sluggish from day one. That is, from the moment I migrated my user files from my old box. It's possible that I got some stuff that affects performance. Three things helped:<p>* First, disabling the dynamic pager [1]. This one has a dramatic effect on performance. In theory, it will prevent OS X from swapping out apps unnecessarily (which it will do even when the apps are active and there is plenty of RAM). I did have some, but not much, swapping going on, but it still improved performance.<p>* Secondly, I uninstalled iStat Menus. I can't be sure that this contributed to the performance problems, but I won't risk reinstalling to find out. It <i>seems</i> to have helped a bit.<p>* Thirdly, I disabled Spotlight indexing of my home directory. This way Alfred will still autocomplete apps. Some apps lose their search functionality, but I never use Spotlight, and I find that I can live without it.<p>I tried the sandbox config fix, but it made no difference to me.<p>The remaining sluggishness seems to come from the graphics layer. For example, doing the Exposé ""reveal all windows"" command takes 3-4 seconds on my box and has a frame rate of approximately 1 fps. It's not great. I notice the reduced graphics performance when scrolling pages in Chrome, whereas Safari is smoother. I suspect this is Retina being a bit too ambitious compared to actual current graphics card performance.<p>As an aside, I believe OS X's I/O system has traditionally been its weak point, being a Mach-based hybrid-microkernel architecture. You can cause GUI scheduling problems by overloading the I/O system, and it's possible that this is exacerbated by having a SSD.",1367249823

I just installed 13.04 on a relatively modern computer yesterday (C2Q, 8GB RAM, an ""old"" 9800GT)  and had what I consider the typical linux experience. Any one of these might halt or scare off a newbie:<p>* It wouldn't let me choose the encrypted/LVM option when formatting the drive before installing. Unencrypted worked though. I didn't bother to really investigate why, maybe the HD is at fault?<p>* Defaults to the nouveau drivers for obvious reasons and I swapped it to the NVidia binary (for specific reasons).  Screen dumped to console on its own while it reset X. Functionally fine, but scary looking compared to anything you'd see in Windows or OSX.<p>* Changing the GPU driver now makes the system boot up in a not-native resolution until LightDM loads. Visually unappealing.<p>* The computer has a Broadcom Wifi card installed that I'd like to use.  Oh boy! (read that as... fuck broadcom).  Obviously not handled by Ubuntu out of the box so I drag out an ethernet cable. Trying to install their binary driver requires command line magic which temporarily breaks dpkg/apt when a installing kernal module stalls out. I fixed that and then installed an open source version which grabbed the binary for me, which worked, but I wouldn't ever expect a layman to figure it out. Requires a reboot to finally function.<p>* Numerous ""application encountered an error"" popups in the 10 or so hours I was working with it. Nothing that halted the OS, but several apps had to restart. It dings my confidence in the quality a bit. And the computer's RAM checked out fine a couple months ago and all temps were normal, I'm going to lean towards either my suspected aforementioned drive issue or actual errors with the apps. Didn't investigate, but they could happen to anyone.<p>* Annoying Amazon and Ubuntu One monetization techniques defaulted into the Unity. It's not a functional issue, but raises concerns about the future of the free software ethos at Canonical and treads awfully close to the adware and spyware that plagues Windows users that the OSS community has been railing against for years.<p>Compare that to OSX where I could just turn it on and have none of these problems, it's not quite rainbows and unicorn farts. I like linux for many reasons and Ubuntu has made great strides towards making Linux available to the masses, but it's still relatively easy to want to do normal things and encounter rough edges that require technical prowess.",1367249515

The big boys don't lose out, because they wouldn't have bought it in the first place.<p>As such, the high moral ground the big boys think they occupy is equally  suspect.<p>IMHO, given the lack of large software houses going out of business actually due to piracy, I don't believe piracy has any real effect. All that is happening is that people are using the software, and the software houses remain profitable.<p>If I am ever yo believe in piracy losing business money, I want proper proof that the vast majority of people which pirated software on their machine would have paid for that software. I suspect not. I suspect that if there really was a way to stop piracy, many more people would use Linux and all it's alternatives for free. In that scenario, MS and co would really start losing money and market power.<p>Addition Edit:
Also, most people spend the money they have. If they did buy all the stuff they pirated, software, games, music, movies, etc, there would be another sector that lost out. For example, pirating Far Cry 3 instead of buying, means 40 (whatever) to spend on clothes, food, cinema, fuel, etc. Its the same money, there is no extra.

That is, taxes can in practice be increased <i>a lot</i> until the rich start fantasizing about going Galt. [D&S] estimate the optimal tax rate, for maximum social welfare, for the richest to be at 70%. It's now about, what, 20%? Citizen Romney paid 14%, and the Great Capitalist still behaves like a little bitch, whining about his being oppressed and all.<p>You also don't seem to take into account elasticity, the decreasing utility of money, or any notion of optimizing social utility. If I'm Bill Gates, I could not give enough of a shit that you taxed from me $5k dollars, or even $500k. But, use that to pay for nine or ten heart surgeries, and suddenly social utility is increased by, I would guesstimate, 100x (total lifetime earnings of those ten people, starting after surgery). Even if 20% of that is embezzled.<p>Also, there's not really any empirical support for a inverse relation between business taxes and economic growth. It's just one data point, granted, but we could take as an example Bush's years.

The most prevalent was simply having a hidden iframe (which actually worked quite well, with the biggest downside being a loading event noise it would fire in Internet Explorer). In Internet Explorer you could also take advantage of any Safe-For-Scripting marked ActiveX control (yes, ActiveX was the foundation upon which XmlHttpRequest was possible, adding binary extensibility to the browser), which at the time included a large number of third party tools and libraries for doing calls to web services, and a lot of hand-rolled solutions, pre-XmlHttpRequest.<p>The problem, of course, is that your users had to have those same components installed which could be an issue.<p>Which was why it was a great convenience when Microsoft started releasing mostly unnoticed XmlHttp components in the MSXML parser library. It was a fragile, memory-leaking beast, but it had the benefit of starting to be packaged in other Microsoft installs, so it was increasingly likely to exist on your client's PCs.<p>The TLDR; is that it was inevitable, and it is unfair to the truth to attribute such a progression to one person.<p>EDIT: To why I know this, at the time '99/'00 we were building a rather innovating web application to monitor and control distributed power generation units across the continent. We used the iframe approach, and then an HTTP component included with a Delphi component suite (name escapes me right now), and were then one of the first beta testers of XmlHttp.",1367248265

The alternative for that might be a modular design with very loose coupling and using Inversion of Control. Then, the only change you would need to make would be in the Inversion of Control configuration to load either the test code or the production code. You could place all the debug and trace code inside a single unit and use an empty stub in production. This would avoid sending the test code to the client on the production environment.<p>I am not an expert in JS, please correct me if this is wrong. I'd do something like this (for checking pre-conditions in method calls):<p>function Assert(condition, message ){}  // this module is loaded/included in production only<p>function Assert(condition, message) { if(!condition) alert(message);} // this module is loaded/included in tests only",1367248218

A study concluded that the introduction of piped water, better sanitation, and chlorination of water sources was responsible for something like three-fourths of the decline in infant mortality between 1900 and 1946 and nearly half the overall reduction in mortality over the same period. Moreover, repeated bouts of diarrhea during childhood permanently impair both physical and cognitive development. It is estimated that by piping uncontaminated, chlorinated water to households, it is possible to reduce diarrhea by up to 95 percent. Poor water quality and pools of stagnant water are also a cause of other major illnesses, including malaria, schistosorniasis, and trachoma, any of which can kill children or make them less productive adults.<p>Nevertheless, the conventional wisdom is that today, at $20 per household per month, providing piped water and sanitation is too expensive for the budget of most developing countries. The experience of Gram Vikas, an NGO that works in Orissa, India, shows, however, that it is possible to do it much more cheaply. Its CEO, Joe Madiath, a man with a self-deprecating sense of humor who attends the annual meeting of the worlds rich and powerful at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in outfits made from homespun cotton, is used to doing things differently. Madiaths career as an activist started early: He was twelve when he first got into troublefor organizing the labor on the plantation that his father owned. He came to Orissa in the early 1970s with a group of left-wing students to help out after a devastating cyclone. After the immediate relief work was over, he decided to stay and see if he could find some more permanent ways to help the poor Oriya villagers. He eventually settled on water and sanitation. What attracted him to the issue was that it was simultaneously a daily challenge and an opportunity to initiate long-term social change. He explained to us that in Orissa, water and sanitation are social issues. Madiath insists that every single household in the villages where Gram Vikas operates should be connected to the same water mains: Water is piped to each house, which contains a toilet, a tap, and a bathing room, all connected to the same system. For the high-caste households, this means sharing water with low-caste households, which, for many in Orissa, was unacceptable when first proposed. It takes the NGO a while to get the agreement of the whole village and some villages eventually refuse, but it has always stuck to the principle that it would not start its work in a village until everyone there agreed to participate. When agreement is finally reached, it is often the first time that some of the upper-caste households participate in a project that involves the rest of the community.<p>Once a village agrees to work with Gram Vikas, the building work starts and continues for one to two years. Only after every single house has received its tap and toilet is the system turned on. In the meantime, Gram Vikas collects data every month on who has gone to the health center to get treated for malaria or diarrhea. We can thus directly observe what happens in a village as soon as the water starts flowing. The effects are remarkable: Almost overnight, and for years into the future, the number of severe diarrhea cases falls by one-half, and the number of malaria cases falls by one-third. The monthly cost of the system for each household, including maintenance, is 190 rupees, or $4 per household (in current USD), only 20 percent of what is conventionally assumed to be the cost of such a system.",1367247822

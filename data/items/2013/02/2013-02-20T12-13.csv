5250154,comment,5250020,5250020,1,0,soneca,,,"I have a very particular view of pitchs.
The other day, on my former job, I had a meeting with wery important CEOs. I had already quit my job and the meeting was to explain my decision, as these CEOs were important clients and I used to handle the contact. Explaining that I decided to move on and go full-time on my startup they casually asked ""what your startup was about""? There it is! THIS is the pitch that matters. In two or three phrases be able to explain what it is, my vision of it and make that vision stays in their heads so, at some convenient moment, they will remember me.
Not just because they were important CEO, this pitch is important so every founder must have it ready, by heart, without thinking, to present his idea do friends - so they understand and support you; to your father - so he doesn't tell you to get a job; to other founders and developers - in order to create a relevant network. The ""nay-sayers"" are just a result of a bad pitch.
This pitch is very important. Is must go out with any thought, automatically. You only need two answers: a initial one, of about three phrases and a complementary one, if the interlocutor become more interested and give you space to evolve your answer. More than that is a conversation, not a pitch.<p>Do you know for who you don't need any pitch? Investors. I don't say potential investors, people that someday may remember you and decide do invest somehow (as the CEOs I mentioned before). No, I am talking about that meeting with interested investor, face to face, when you are there only to present your startup and he is there only to decide whether they will invest or not on you. A meeting is a conversation, not a pitch. It is the moment where you tell them what do you know, not what you have memorized. You must listen to the investors, understand their doubts, it demands a lot of empathy. Before a meeting like this you must prepare your knowledge, not your speech. Any PPT is only needed if you must show important, complex and specific data ( therefore, not worthy of memorizing).<p>Something different are startups events. To start with, I think these presentations on startup events are highly overestimated. In general, they exist more to promote the event itself (and the brand of the organizer) than to make your startup any good. Events are great for networking, learn new things, discover different opinions, but not for pitchs. The only exceptions are accelerators' demo days, but even so, I would guess that most investors go into these ocasions already briefed about whom they will talk to. But some serendipity may occur. These kind of pitch are more focused on memory than knowledge. Q&As at the end of your pitch are always more about mistakes or absences on your presentation than about investment decision doubts.<p>I don't want to rebel against the system here. I only think that ""pitch"" is a twisted concept these days. Too much influence on it of media, ego and vanities. In summary I think two things are essential: i) you must have a very memorized pitch, as a standard first answer, ready to go out without any further thought, to anyone who ask you what is your startup about - something clear, short and visionary at the same time, to show the idea and attract interest and ii) you must not have anything memorized when this initial pitch becomes and actual convesation, but, for sure, be deeply updated about all the knowledge that involves your startup.",1361365081

Personally I don't think it's that big a deal and I'm not sure Apple will ever build an option like that in iOS.<p>I think Apple's next big innovation is probably not on the mobile platform, but in the living room instead. There have been rumours of an Apple-branded TV for quite some time now and Steve Jobs himself noted in an interview how he was annoyed that television sets were still pretty hard to use. I'm betting Apple will release a television in 2013 with no remote control, using Siri instead. Perhaps a nice iTunes integration as well for on-demand television. Perhaps Siri-controlled iTunes integration. When that happens people will remember why Apple is known to innovate and others are known to follow Apple's lead.<p>That said, it will be interesting to see what features iOS 7 and the iPhone 6 (5S?) will bring. There's been some changes within Apple. With Jonathan Ive responsible for UI interaction we might expect some big changes. It will be interesting to see what his influence will be.",1361364517

5250101,comment,5248544,5248544,2,0,Jenk,,,"UK person here. We've had this problem for a decade or so.<p>It started in the 90s with companies wanting graduates for roles that really doesn't require a higher education and if you didn't have a degree, your CV/Resume was promptly filed in the bin. So the government made higher education a lot more accessible and pimped it out a lot, much to the expense of both the students and the nation. More Universities, bigger classes, wider spectrum of courses, etc.<p>Lots of people now have degrees. I mean <i>lots</i>. When students are planning their education, there really isn't a ""not go to University"" option that doesn't carry the sweeping the streets or factory line worker stigma with it. It's also really quite rare to meet anyone younger than ~35 that hasn't been to university.<p>We don't quite have the Pedigree problem that, as a foreigner, it appears the US does - i.e. we don't really have a ""X University is better than Y"" type classification going on (e.g. in TV programme 'Suits', Pearson Hardman will <i>only</i> recruit Harvard educated lawyers. No other College graduates need apply. No idea how 'real' this problem is in the States.) There is some social perception of certain universities, but I'm yet to encounter any restriction being imposed based on which University someone has been to. However, we are seeing the ""Must have a 1st Degree with Masters"" line appearing on job adverts more and more which is simply just pushing the bar higher, as I imagine is what employers in the US asking for ""College X"" educated applicants are doing.<p>All the while we have an education system that is drilling into our young people's heads (and their parents) that University is a must. There's a lot of pressure for young people to get into University.<p>Degrees are not worth anything like they were before because <i>everyone</i> has one. Nobody ""stands out"" any more, is all I mean. Everyone has one because of the demand, and the government gave everyone a big boost into Uni. Recently the government had to cut back on the pseudo-subsidy they were giving to the student body, so now we also have a lot of young people who think University is make-or-break, but will also have a large amount of debt (60,000+) before they've even started working.<p>Despite all this there seems to be - at least in my experience as one of the few people to have not attended university - a growing number of employers who are starting to ignore the necessity for a degree. Degrees are still regarded as a demonstration of one's character and ability to learn, but it's becoming less and less of a requirement. Perhaps it is just my experience but recruiters, employers, and certainly myself as someone who has recruited many times, are seeing past the qualifications and doing their own assessment (for lack of a better phrase) of prospective employees. I don't mean we're sitting our own exams, I mean we are doing meaningful interviews. We're inviting candidates to work with us for a few hours, and so on. Employers are realising they want to hire intelligent people, and that not everyone has access to a University education, and also that the current education system just doesn't work for everyone.

I've already got devices buzzing etc. to get my attention for ""important thing"".<p>The argument for things like Glass is that they will make the merging of reality and technology seamless which could have great advantages. I fear, however, that it just means I'll have a thing right in front of my face asking for my attention.<p>The $1B idea with Google Glass is not the technology of putting it in front of your eyes etc., it's figuring out the software that filters down what's shown to the stuff you actually want/need.

It may even be possible even if they don't have Glass using a combo of geolocation and facial recognition. The most exciting bit is sending a message between two glass users because it'd be pretty much like telepathy.<p>When the 'internet of thing' comes about, it may even be posdible to control all your various devices without lifting a finger. I could look at my kettle from across the room and flick it on!<p>There are tonnes of possibilities and I think, especially when it's on a contact lens, it will make what's currently considered magical (telepathy, psychokinesis, etc) a reality, just like the plane removed the magic from human flight.<p>I think wearable computing opens up many exciting doors and the two thoughts above only scratch the surface of the possibilities I imagine.<p>In fact, I feel so strongly about ot I'd emigrate to the US just to get my hands on this awesome tech.

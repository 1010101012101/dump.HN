Best we could do is get a discount. You're talking about revenue sharing. I've never seen anyone extract that out of them.",1179768776
23652,comment,23444,23596,0,0,JohnN,,,"I admit it s good thing to happen now, I am not bitter in any way. i am almost glad.<p>1) The investment is not a lot in monetary value but I couldn't get started without it, in that respect it is ""worth it"" I could probably pay the person back if the company made even  a little money. The person is still involved in the sense that I could ask for help and ideas etc but i would not expect proactive participation.<p>2) You are right, almost no value has been created as of yet, so if we were to shut up shop tomorrow, he would have lost out.<p>
3) I think the ejector button would be too strong, the advice etc this person has given and i am sure will give will be invaluable. however, i would not expect a LOT of work in terms of execution. But then execution is what matters. If the company did well I believe this person would join. But i would not expect him to leave his job in uncertainty.<p>4) He left because he is just not THAT interested in Web Apps. No interest = no determination and no determination = no startup in all honesty. Maybe I should have seen this coming. I was visibly more enthusiastic than him.<p>
I think I will push forward until launch (mid-summer) on my own but will look out for another co-founder. If anything this situation has made me more determined to succeed. I am reminded of Evan Williams at Blogger!",1179768054

23646,comment,23601,23601,0,0,far33d,,,"The problem with over-abstraction is that it makes all specific tasks equally difficult. In order to make the hard easier, it makes the easy harder. And that's assuming that you aren't using some slight boundary condition of the abstraction, in which case even the hard becomes even harder still. <p>Usually, the first thing you think of (in this case, the way the python is implemented) is usually best. If you need something more specific, a specific, instead of abstract, solution is probably better.<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html</a><p>",1179767103

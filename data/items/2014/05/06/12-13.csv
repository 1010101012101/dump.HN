7704101,comment,7700691,7703169,2,0,nayefc,,,"While I agree to what you&#x27;re saying, the use of Arabic is not disappearing in the rest of the Arab world as in parts of Lebanon. Some Lebanese see themselves as &quot;non-Arabs&quot;, when Lebanese are nothing but Arabs. Those who are in an identity struggle are using French and English mostly, and can&#x27;t speak Arabic well. I have Lebanese relatives, and some words they say in Arabic are really heavy Arabic words that even we don&#x27;t use. They still avoid saying that it is indeed, Arabic.<p>I am Palestinian-Jordanian and I do understand almost all slang accents fairly well. The only one I have trouble with is the Moroccan/Algerian. I understand it as long as they do not inject French or Berber words and speak slowly.<p>The levant accents are extremely similar that the gulf cannot really differentiate between Syrian, Jordanian, Lebanese and Palestinian (although we see them as distinct and can pick up which accent is spoken from just a word or two). The same phenomenon is seen in the gulf. Iraq is pretty distinct, yet closer to the gulf. Everyone understands Egypt as it is pretty close to Standard Arabic (just like the Levant), although its quirks have become known through songs, movies and shows which are dominated by Egyptians.<p>As for Standard (or Classical) Arabic, everyone in Jordan (or most of the Arab world) who went through some sort of schooling can speak it, and understand it perfectly. The news, newspapers and any formal event is given in proper Arabic. All Arabic literature, books, and writings are also in Standard Arabic.<p>My point is, while I agree with you that the use of Arabic is degrading, I doubt it will ever be overtaken by French or English (depending on where you live). English and French are being seen as a symbol of being educated, and those who are uneducated try to speak English or French (albeit terribly). Some who like to show off, or have some sort of identity struggle, rely heavily on French or English. Outside of these insecurities, Arabic is pretty much always in use.",1399380867
7704099,comment,7703658,7703858,3,0,VLM,,,"&quot;what do you mean about the phone&quot;<p>Both my personal use credit union, and the bank my volunteer gig uses, have an outsourced authenticator who logs the ip addresses I use, and if I&#x27;m attempting to log in from a new address they SMS or voice call a number on file with a six digit number I type in to authenticate the new device.  Neither the CU or bank have anything to do with each other, but use the same system, so I&#x27;m guessing its some kind of nationwide outsourced system that &quot;many&quot; financial institutions use.<p>Still have to enter your password to verify its me on my computer today, and not my kid screwing around on my computer, they only SMS authenticate perhaps once a month.<p>The same outsourcer apparently does password recovery when you get locked out.  The bank requires full password recovery process if you don&#x27;t log in for 45 days, which is an unholy annoyance for a sleepy volunteer org.  The life of a treasurer is never easy I guess.<p>Its moderately annoying as my phone lives on its charger in the bedroom if I&#x27;m at home, and the desktop in the office is at least 75 foot walk away, so when the authentication service feels like pulling my chain, I swear a lot and make a trek and inevitably the login times out so I have to start all over again once I fetch the phone.  Which fits in with stereotypical security theater, you &quot;win&quot; if you make it inconvenient, no need to actually make it secure.<p>(edited to add I live in the USA, upper midwest, vaguely near Chicago, everyone else responding is at least 4000 miles away, I interpreted your request as how they use phones to auth in the USA, so, well, this is how they do it)",1399380854

It has been that I come out with a better understanding of computer science and programming, But any immediate vocational improvement  is directly proportional to the time actually spent implementing the ideas in code - e.g. I took a course that reccommend EMACS and my &#x27;skill&#x27; in EMACS is a result of many days using it.<p>Good luck.",1399379416

Similarly you don&#x27;t want to destructure an array from {data: [1, 2, 3]} into {data_0: 1, data_1: 2, data_2: 3} unless you absolutely have to.)<p>Once you flatten it, then partial responses for things which return a struct do exactly what you want; you say e.g.:<p><pre><code>    [&quot;myQuery&quot;, {on: &quot;stuff&quot;, _fields: [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]}]\n</code></pre>\nand you just get {&quot;a&quot;:1,&quot;b&quot;:2,&quot;c&quot;:3} as your JSON response.<p>So what I&#x27;m saying in summary is that if you write your own APIs you can get this sort of functionality without building a magic tool; the reason that the magic tool is not mainstream is because it&#x27;s only right for dealing with structs and not hashes (because if there&#x27;s a hash elsewhere in the object a user might register their own key in the hash called &quot;ctime&quot;); and given that some API gives you a complex structure, flattening it the way you&#x27;re doing is potentially a little risky because later updates might say that there&#x27;s another ctime to some other part of the Users object.",1399378712
7703951,comment,7702974,7702974,9,0,kevingadd,,,"&#x27;Fast&#x27; is a poor descriptive choice for a library that was clearly written without attention paid to CPU performance characteristics, GPU performance characteristics, or the nature of modern Canvas implementations.<p>EDIT: A quick glance at the sample game &#x27;O!&#x27; in the chrome profiler shows that it is triggering a garbage collection roughly every second. Pretty bad for a game with such low scene complexity and rendering complexity, and those pauses may be long on a mobile device.<p>Based on a casual review of the source code (which I&#x27;ll note is quite readable - good job!), here are some obvious problems that probably need to be addressed, both in terms of actual performance and code quality.<p>Don&#x27;t render the scene in graph traversal order; doing so ensures that the number of graphics state changes (shader, transform, texture, etc) is as high as possible. Most game engines render using a more sophisticated algorithm where your drawing operations are ordered (as possible - obviously layering has to be preserved) by graphics state in order to minimize overhead.<p>For some documentation on this approach, see articles like\n<a href=""http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=86"" rel=""nofollow"">http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=86</a>\nI&#x27;ve been using this approach in my games for years and it produces a <i>huge</i> measurable performance improvement on virtually all modern architectures (even canvas, though it&#x27;s less significant there)<p>The tickBefore/tick/tickAfter architecture is particularly suspicious, as is its use of poorly-scaling algorithms/primitives like Array.splice. Usually this sort of thing is more clearly and efficiently handled by having an ordered set of operations (typically represented by a linked list, a heapqueue, or an array of priority-value tuples that you sort once per frame).<p>I see frequent references to Cut.Pin.prototype.absoluteMatrix and .matrix. I will note that these don&#x27;t appear to create garbage - which is great! - but they silently mutate a shared Matrix instance which means that it is very easy for a library consumer to end up with their state corrupted - if you store the result of absoluteMatrix, then modify the state of a Pin, that matrix will suddenly become corrupted. Sadly the code appears to make no effort to warn users about this.<p>You&#x27;re not using any type hinting (i.e. | 0, +) which means that JS JITs will have to work harder to figure out whether given values are integers, floats, or something else. This results in JIT recompilations, less efficient in-memory representation, and in some cases results in floating point/integer values being boxed instead of stored efficiently on the stack/heap.<p>You mix different types in some of your slots (for one example, Anim._time is both &#x27;object&#x27; and &#x27;integer&#x27;) which prevents optimization in most modern JS runtimes. This can have a catastrophic impact on performance in some scenarios, so you should avoid it if possible. A good way to replace a null/integer pattern is to have an integer that&#x27;s always an integer, along with a hasValue boolean - this is how nullable primitives work in C#, for example.<p>Some of your non-initialization code uses temporary object literals - this.pin({ ... }), this._next = { ... }, etc - which is a recipe for bad performance and GC pauses if you&#x27;re doing it during updates or rendering operations. It&#x27;s not immediately obvious to me whether you could optimize this out easily, but you should make sure these temporary literals are not being created in large quantities.<p>You have many functions containing throw statements and a few containing catch statements. In most JS runtimes these both prevent optimization of the function body. You can solve this by hoisting the throw into a utility function (In JSIL I have a &#x27;JSIL.RuntimeError&#x27; function that just does &#x27;throw&#x27;) - this allows the function to be optimized even if the throw-function is not optimized or inlined. When you have a single throw statement in a complex high-traffic function this can matter a lot.<p>You appear to not be validating or properly type-casting the inputs you pass to canvas.drawImage, which will impair performance and result in runtime errors. I can tell you&#x27;ve already run into problems with this since your drawImage call has a try/catch wrapped around it (YUCK) - the right solution here is to read the spec (that more or less clearly specifies the expected types and constraints for drawImage), and then make sure your code satisfies those constraints. It will be much faster and more reliable if you do so.<p>It appears that you may have many scenarios where you call drawImage with a source rectangle. This tends to be poorly-performing in canvas implementations (due to deficiencies in the spec), so if you want that to be fast for source rectangles that don&#x27;t change, you should cache the source rectangle in a unique canvas so you can draw without source parameters. Typically source-rect blits can&#x27;t be batched at all (i.e. one hardware draw call per blit) so this makes a big difference.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more, this is just the result of a quick skim of the code. Feel free to contact me if you have more questions. You can identify many of these performance problems by reading specs and using things like Chrome&#x27;s profiler and Firefox&#x27;s SPS and JIT Inspector profiling tools.<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of people sharing their libraries and engines with the world, but if you&#x27;re going to spout superlatives you need to be prepared to back them up. Otherwise, people who don&#x27;t know better will be misled by your dishonesty and end up having their efforts at using your tech go to waste when they have to port to something better.",1399378689

7703904,comment,7703722,7703860,3,0,lugg,,,"> There were three main challenges. First, PowerDNS when under large in-bound DDoS loads would consume excessive resources and occasionally fall over. Second, and more insidious, because the version of PowerDNS we were using did not have abuse detection and rate limiting, we were increasingly seeing attempts at using CloudFlare authoritative DNS network to launch reflection attacks against others. And, third, it was very difficult to extend PowerDNS and add any sort of application logic which kept us from doing interesting things... like adding Easter Eggs.<p>Source (was linked in article): <a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-story-of-a-little-dns-easter-egg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-story-of-a-little-dns-easter-...</a>",1399378028

If you say it out loud you can hear it (and hopefully feel the extra tongue work that, traditionally, we try to avoid).<p>Another common exception is &#x27;Hotel&#x27;. It takes &#x27;an&#x27; rather than the expected &#x27;a&#x27; as for some reason we drop the &#x27;H&#x27;.

The result is that we&#x27;ve been able to do all sorts of stuff that&#x27;s CloudFlare-specific: bear in mind that we handle two different sorts of DNS queries: external ones (that might or might not serve a CloudFlare IP that is proxying for a customer site) and internal ones (that need access to public, non-CloudFlare IPs). We also recently introduced a CNAME-flattening feature: <a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-...</a><p>There are other things we want to do to be fast in two ways: fast to respond (<a href=""http://www.solvedns.com/dns-comparison/2014/04"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solvedns.com/dns-comparison/2014/04</a>) and fast to update (which means integration with our replicated, global settings databases).<p>We also have all sorts of special things that we do to deal with attacks on our DNS infrastructure that include the DNS server talking directly to NICs for filtering and packet handling. We&#x27;re also generating bpf bytecode directly for specific filtering activities.<p>Bottom line was that DNS is a core technology for CloudFlare; it made sense to totally own it. I don&#x27;t think this says anything bad about PowerDNS. Note: HTTP serving is a core technology. If nginx weren&#x27;t so configurable (especially through OpenResty) we could easily have been having this discussion about a web server. But equally agentzh (who wrote OpenResty) works for us.",1399377688

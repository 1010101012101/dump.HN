334436,comment,333367,334145,0,0,biohacker42,,,"I'm not sure I can name truly great hackers, but I absolutely know very good ones and sorta bad ones.<p>Here's what I mean by sorta bad. They are very smart people, they know the language, they can code and then some. They can work out very complex stuff, super complex algorithms.<p>But when working on a large project, over time they slowly start to wrap them selves up in such as a way as to quickly hit a wall of frustration. Their productivity drops 10 fold, and it's crawling on broken shards of glass from then on.<p>The other type of hacker, initially is indistinguishable from the first. Except that whey they work on very large systems, they seem to be able to almost <i>smell</i> where the code base is going.<p>They are able to keep a large architecture in mind, continually adjust it and adjust their code. Most importantly it seems they have a great intuition about which frustrations are worth pushing through and which you should go around of.<p>It's that kid of code foresight that great hackers have.",1224165466

Every ""cool"" feature that is has is killed by its counter-intuitive software and obtuse case design. It needs something game changing, and that's the next game changing feature.<p>Of course, the cell phone will probably have a much better chance to make this a reality first before the Zune, but they can try.",1224165443

PHP5 was released around 2004 with significant upgrades to the language with a high degree of backwards-compatibility and it still hasn't reached complete adoption.  Only now with official support coming to an end and more web host support, will it become the standard.<p>The adoption of Python 3 will likely differ, since Python is not a standard feature of low-cost web hosts and has a wide range of uses outside of web development.  It should be interesting to see how this plays out.",1224165082

If they can get that down, FriendFeed will be every tech nerd's new TV.<p>A question I have is whether or not you guys think FriendFeed can cross into the mainstream?

334423,comment,333155,334237,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""In studies where they offer one group of undergrads money to complete some random task and another group does it for free?""<p>The studies are pretty wide ranging. For example, people paid to wear their seatbelts are less likely to do so. People who are offered money if they lose weight are less successful, and are more likely to gain even more weight. If teachers are offered money if their students improve on a test, the students will do worse on the test. Students who study something in an attempt to get a good grade will have a more superficial understanding of the material than they would otherwise.<p>""Things work differently at the other end of the expertise spectrum.""<p>Maybe that's true once your work is at the genius level and you don't need any more external validation, but even if so how do you get there? If you've been mastering your craft for twenty years and then you're offered money it might not be damaging, if done right, but being offered money too soon may well harm the average person.<p>""The great artists couldn't bring themselves to produce shit, any more than great people in any field ever can.""<p>George Lucas.",1224164831

- Lose some of the fluff. For example, in your ""what?"" section, you could've written it as simply ""We notify you when artists release new albums"". There is no reason to have more words than you need to describe your product.
- I would have preferred voice in the video. Don't be shy, having a voice over helps a lot.
- Maybe add a way to import information from existing sources like Last.fm or Facebook's music interests?<p>I'm intrigued by how you guys plan to monetize this, but maybe I'm just greedy and should be thankful for a web app that helps alleviate some of my headaches.",1224164766
334419,comment,334416,334416,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"The punchline, from the abstract: ""We find that when selecting a problem-solving team from a diverse population of intelligent agents, a team of randomly selected agents outperforms a team comprised of the best-performing agents. This result relies on the intuition that, as the initial pool of problem solvers becomes large, the best-performing agents necessarily become similar in the space of problem solvers. Their relatively greater ability is more than offset by their lack of problem-solving diversity.""<p>It's not always true, of course, that a randomly selected group will outperform a group of top performers.  But the result does suggest that it's worth thinking hard about the tradeoff between diversity and ability, and that sometimes the former is more important than the latter.",1224164732
334418,story,,,5,1,dbreunig,"Columbus Day == Startup Day?",,"Next year Columbus Day should be rechristened Startup Day.<p>I think we've evolved beyond the knee-jerk reactions against Columbus. True, his voyage did kick off an arguably inevitable run through the native people of this continent. It's a tragedy.<p>But we have no reason to hold that against Columbus! He didn't set out to destroy entire populations any more than he set out to discover North America! Let's not let the pendulum swing so far the other way, not only (rightfully) taking away his credit for ""discovering"" a continent but assigning him blame for the ensuing death? Let's settle down and look at what he did that's worth noting.<p>He took a chance that no one else was willing to take for the sake of huge business returns. Oh, but it wasn't just for the money. It was for the adventure, the knowledge, and the pride. When faced with zero funds of his own to help him achieve what he felt he knew to be beyond the horizon, he went searching for capital. The VCs fo the day, royalty, heard his pitch and funded his quest. With cash in hand, he didn't cash out. He didn't pawn it off to someone else: he spent long hours and risked life and limb for knowledge and business. Something we should all celebrate.<p>Sound familiar?<p>Next year let's add to the list of Startups in history. Let's celebrate them on Columbus Day.<p>Thoughts?",1224164715

334414,comment,334376,334376,0,0,charlesju,,,"I completely agree with Business Week. This stock market is oversold.<p>For instance, Yahoo is definitely worth more than a 16 X P/E, no internet company of Yahoo's reach and size should be worth 16 X P/E. $2B in cash, $4B in liquid assets, and only $2B in liabilities. $1B in profit, every quarter. It's just a function of the rest of the world going online and using existing web portals, a lot of them are going to use Yahoo. That, or they'll receive another offer for a buyout, which is highly possible.<p>Another good stock buying technique is to buy small chunks of the stock market over a set amount of time, I believe this is called ""averaging down"". It relies on the fact that you don't know where the bottom will be, so it averages that risk across multiple investments, which is a lot safer than just placing 1 bet for where you think the bottom will be. I think that if you were to average down into a leveraged index ETF right now (ie. MVV), you'll be making buttloads of money in 5-10 years, with an averaging down investment schedule to take the money you want to invest, and split that investment up over a 2 year span.<p>Of course, I'm just a lowly tech entrepreneur that has also lost a little bit of money in this recent downturn, so what do I know, haha",1224164355

Even though Python is pretty popular now, removing any barriers to adoption would only help it more, and one of the best ways to do this is to adopt non-programmers.

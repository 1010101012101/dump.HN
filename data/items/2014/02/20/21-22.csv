7273938,comment,7271704,7273652,3,0,benched,,,"Whether it is possible to proactively mitigate a circumstance has no bearing on whether the circumstance <i>exists</i>. I met plenty of people through sports and work. The Freeze is a local, cultural ambient background of social norms. It&#x27;s an impression that each person is, more than  usual, in their own private world. It&#x27;s a lack of friendliness. It&#x27;s strangers never looking at you or saying &#x27;hi&#x27; - and there <i>are places in the world</i> where it is normal to look at strangers and say hi when you pass them. People don&#x27;t say much. When they do they don&#x27;t emote much, and it tends toward mealy-mouthed politeness. I could theorize about potential factors - off the top of my head I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s partly due to an unusually high population of affluent introverts. By now, even second-generation affluent introverts (e.g. the grown children of the people who made Windows). It affects me as a constant general background of insularity and alienation. It&#x27;s quite apart from the issue of whether I&#x27;ve made friends through activities - I&#x27;ve done that. Obviously, nobody is saying that no human being in Seattle ever associates with any other, ever.<p>It also occurs to me that it&#x27;s maybe a sort of social tragedy of the commons. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being a locksmith, but an entire society of locksmiths would probably run into problems. Likewise, it&#x27;s not a sin to be introverted, but a party (or a city) where everyone is introverted is going to be missing something, and become very dependent on the presence of Guitar Hero or Settlers of Catan stations for fun.",1392933459

A typical tip calculator will tell me that with a 15% tip, this would be 18.54, and with a 20% tip it would be 19.34.<p>I don&#x27;t want to screw around with that .54 or .34. I want to give the delivery person an integral number of dollars. Probably hand him a $20, and tell him how many dollar bills to give me back.<p>I made a tip calculator Dashboard widget to calculate tips from that perspective. With this widget, I enter 16.12, and it gives me a little table that looks like this:<p><pre><code>   $17.... 5.5%\n   $18....11.7%\n   $19....18%\n   $20....24.2%\n   $21....30.5%\n</code></pre>\nI can glance at that, and see that $19 or $20 for combined $16.12 pizza plus tip are reasonable options. If it were summer, I&#x27;d probably go for $19, especially if I could do that without breaking a $20. If it were winter, I&#x27;d probably just go with a $20 bill and no change, to get the transaction over with as quickly as possible so I could close the door and stop losing my precious heat.",1392933448

There are lots and lots and lots of innovative startups that don&#x27;t get acquired and go through the whole process without all that much press. You don&#x27;t see them, it&#x27;s boring to read &quot;Startup that changes the ways machine tools are stocked at machine shops turns in another year.&quot; The really crazy ones (either crazy funding like Color, or crazy exits like WhatsApp) get <i>lots</i> of press, and so one things &quot;oh they are all like that.&quot;<p>Acquisitions are a way that investors get their money back, so they encourage investors to invest in startups, and by its nature that <i>encourages</i> innovation. Perhaps not as much as random $100K grants given out on the street corner would, but it does encourage company formation and execution. IPOs do the same thing.<p>What investors <i>don&#x27;t</i> like is a company they invest in, own a big chunk of the equity and it never goes anywhere. So called &quot;zombies&quot;, companies that are nominally profitable, but not not enough cash flow to support M&A, too much cash flow to just roll them up.

Add 400,000,000 more users to the platform and you bolster the power of the FB brand, get more ads in front of 400mln users and expand your reach into unpenetrated markets that do not have internet access reliable enough to use facebook.

Many locales place regulations on telecom companies (such as the aforementioned requirement that a company serve an entire city and not just the wealthy neighborhoods) but in order for companies to be able to be profitable under those regulations, they ask for a franchise agreement in return.<p>Google Fiber has so far been able to avoid these complications because they&#x27;re picking and choosing their markets. They go after unencumbered markets where they can deliver service to only the wealthy parts of town (Austin being a great example -- anything inside the city limits is relatively wealthy while the less wealthy folks live in the far-flung suburbs.

Here&#x27;s one: smart people who figure out better ways to allocate money should be able to consistently beat the market performance.</i><p>Markets behaving irrationally/stupidly != Markets behaving predictably<p>So I disagree that if markets are stupid (irrational is a better word, but stupid would do) other people in the know could take advantage of them. Just because a given person cannot predict the movements of the market, that doesn&#x27;t mean the market encodes some special unknown information or is in some aggregate sense smarter or more informed than that person. If the market moves essentially randomly in the short term, the most informed person would not have much chance of beating it.<p>The market doesn&#x27;t need to be clever to beat you, on the contrary, often it beats people by persisting in stupidity for much longer than they thought possible, or longer than they have time for, until they give in and invest, and then perhaps soon after it reverts to something resembling rational for a short while. That&#x27;s not to mention the many ways in which our stock markets and other markets are rigged and stacked by insiders (insider trading, market manipulation, LIBOR, forex etc). So your contention that you&#x27;d need to be incredibly talented to &#x27;beat the market&#x27; as you put it isn&#x27;t very convincing - there is another explanation for the studies you cite - almost no-one is able to consistently beat the market, except by luck.<p>I suspect (though it is just supposition), that markets are the average of all the uninformed and panicky humans who make them up, and that in those crowds of investors and speculators you&#x27;ll find a madding mill of people all looking for the main chance which oscillates in a chaotic manner, not a huge collective wisdom which outshines everyone on the planet.",1392931066

Because there’s a lot of water in the world but very few diamonds.</i><p>Diamonds are actually a great metaphor for overpriced executive &quot;talent&quot;. Why? First, diamonds are <i>not fucking rare</i>. The price has been heavily manipulated. In executives, the manipulation pertains to the closed social network of entrenched parasites who can get those jobs: a similar cartel over high-echelon relationships (and owed favors, and extortions). The scarcity is illusory; there are a hundred times more people who are competent to fill their shoes. Second, many diamonds are junk. Third, diamonds are not really natural. Diamonds from the earth must be carved into a man-made shape through technical means, and (anyway) artificial diamonds are often superior in quantity. Similarly, &quot;executive talent&quot; is an artificial artifact, not some genetically-ordained rarity. Fourth, there&#x27;s a lot of negativity and violence, even, involved in keeping this phony scarcity intact.<p>I guess the major difference is that few diamonds have <i>negative</i> value, while most corporate executives do.<p>The greatest trick these assholes (the upper class) ever played on society is convincing us that we need them, and that they are somehow so special that having connections to their stupid little club should be the #1 dominating factor in who makes the most money, gets to make important decisions, and works in the highest-level jobs.",1392930509

Where as in  capital markets Line Of Business, the pay is awesome, the PCs/notebooks are best of class and there is virtually no outsourcing and little bureaucracy.

But venture returns are not that great(average 7% annual) which explains the little money invested in them(less than $15 billion in 2013).",1392930071

Libertarians often come to that belief by being skeptical about <i>any</i> concentration of power... it just so happens that the US Federal government is today the biggest concentration of power, so you hear about that one the most. Thanks to crony capitalism, the line between &quot;government&quot; and &quot;big business&quot; can be a hard one to find. The general solution proposed by the supposedly-non-naive non-libertarians is to... give the government more power. Why it is supposedly so obvious that this is the correct solution to the problem of that we can openly mock anyone who disagrees is, frankly, unclear to me; the evidence that more government power has decreased large corporation&#x27;s power anytime in the recent past seems pretty lacking, if you ask me. It seems to have just made the purchasing of favors that much easier.",1392930038

6295053,comment,6294509,6294509,1,0,thedealmaker,,,"I have been through this transition as well. I actually moved from a big city in the U.S to small city in the middle of Europe. I am just about to emerge on the other side with a new venture with funding already lined up. I have been where you are; making multiple adjustments and feeling like it&#x27;s all temporary. Anyway here is my advice. Embrace your new position as a new adventure and put as much as you can into doing the best work you can. Doing good work is a positive feedback loop that sneaks into other areas of your life that maybe lacked attention during your extreme focus on your start up. This time is a gift to your life as a human being. Additionally, unplug from the start up scene. One, it&#x27;s not going anywhere and when you are ready you will find your place in the market. Also at the moment it can only cause you confusion about your current position or choices and perhaps pain or envy. However don&#x27;t mistake that advise with not reflecting. Please do take time to reflect on your past venture and the mistakes that were under your control and accept the learning from them. Hell you paid for them already, right? Especially key in on the moments or decisions when you let your instincts be overruled due to doubt, lack of knowledge, board members, co-founder, etc. This helped me find my &quot;signpost&quot; internally and led me out of the fog an into my best self again. If you withstood the pressure of a start up then you can push though this phase of your life and into the new. Good Luck!",1377770157

6295049,comment,6292273,6294178,3,0,mherdeg,,,"No design is perfect. For example, the current United boarding pass does not <i>anywhere</i> print the name of your class of service! If you&#x27;re trying to access a Lufthansa lounge with a UA business-class boarding pass, you will have some trouble as agents squint looking for the word &quot;business&quot; or &quot;first&quot; somewhere on your boarding pass (it appears nowhere) and grudgingly accept that the flight number has a letter after it which indicates either the fare class (if printed at a kiosk) or the cabin class (if printed by an agent).<p>So, a UA boarding pass may say &quot;930D&quot; meaning that it&#x27;s for flight UA930 booked into a discount business class fare (D fare), or &quot;930J&quot; meaning that it&#x27;s for flight UA930 booked into the business class cabin (J), but <i>nowhere on the boarding pass</i> will it say &quot;Business&quot;. I&#x27;ve heard stories of people who are only allowed into a LH first-class lounge when the agents, unable to prove that a boarding pass is really for the F cabin, finally give up and decide that the seat assignment &quot;1A&quot; must be first class.<p>So, no design is perfect. As everywhere this is an area where you need a deep understanding of what the product is for in order to design a useful product.<p>One obvious example of something that is missing here because of a lack of deep understanding of how air travel works is the ticket number itself, i.e. a reference to the actual underlying travel document which lets someone travel. You don&#x27;t need this number immediately (passenger full name and flight number should usually be enough), but it can help a LOT with ancillary systems (online checkin, frequent-flyer mileage credit, etc.) Whenever I make travel arrangements, I always want to know my ticket number, which is strong evidence that I really have bought the trip (and don&#x27;t just have a &quot;reservation&quot; that can be partially or improperly ticketed).<p>I&#x27;m willing to accept that maybe it was a deliberate choice in this design to abandon the record locator (the six-character code, sometimes called a &quot;PNR&quot;, that uniquely identifies a traveler&#x27;s itinerary from a particular operating carrier&#x27;s point of view), but abandoning the ticket number seems a bit too much.<p>For a deeper example, the design in this blog post includes a &quot;stub&quot; which shows you where you&#x27;re sitting (great) but does not include your date of travel (uh oh). If a gate agent rips off the stub and keeps the &quot;big&quot; part of your boarding pass, you will know where to sit (great) but may have trouble getting retroactive credit for your flight if your miles fail to post (because there is no date of travel on your boarding pass, which may make it harder to recognize and certainly makes it harder for you to remember which date of travel to look for).<p>(The &quot;stub&quot; in this design does have a barcode, but this almost certainly wouldn&#x27;t be good enough for retroactive mileage credit. On a legacy carrier, there are something like 15 different mileage programs you can possibly credit your flight to, all with different rules and knowledge about how other carriers work. To get retroactive mileage credit on a flight you would almost certainly want the traveler name, flight number, date of travel, ticket number, and (if you can get it) carrier&#x27;s class of service.)",1377770091

I was inspired to make this because that&#x27;s something I ended up doing manually quite a bit.<p>It&#x27;s HTML5 with jquery and jquery-mobile, mainly for the slider elements (which I didn&#x27;t know how to make myself). I wish I could have avoided using jquery-mobile because it was quite a headache trying to deactivate a bunch of the default features and just use the slider.<p>It uses the standary HTML5 audio player. When the play button is pressed, all the audio streams play. When the value of each slider is changed, the volume for that player is updated with JS.<p>iOS devices don&#x27;t support changing the volume via javascript in any fashion, so this won&#x27;t work on any iOS device. I don&#x27;t see a way of getting around that. It should work in most other modern browsers. Seems to work in IE10, FF, Chrome and the stock Android browser.<p>The only slightly tricky thing was getting seamless looping for the audio samples. The HTML5 audio player has a &quot;loop&quot; setting, but in every browser I tried it in there was an audible gap between the end and start of playback. Very annoying in this kind of application. To get around that, each audio track fades in and out at the beginning and end. When the player reaches the beginning of the &quot;fade out&quot; section of the main track, about 10 seconds before the end, it triggers a 25s &quot;glue&quot; track to start playing, which fades in as the main track fades out. When the glue track begins to fade out, it triggers the main track to fade in again at the beginning. The end result is something approaching a seamless loop with constant volume. I think it works quite well for ambeint noise, but it obviously wouldn&#x27;t work for anything with a beat.<p>The sounds are all CC licensed samples from freesound.org [3][4] that I did my best to mix and clean up. In the unlikely event this ever became popular, I&#x27;d love to make some field recordings myself to get a bigger range of sounds in higher quality, but that&#x27;s a bit of a pipe dream.<p><pre><code>    [1] http://www.rainymood.com/\n    [2] http://coffitivity.com/\n    [3] http://www.freesound.org/\n    [4] http://asoftmurmur.com/info.html\n</code></pre>\n---<p>If I have time and I find anyone who wants to use it, I hope in the future to add more sounds, better initial presets, saving presets, stop-playing-after-x-minutes, fade-out-over-x-minutes and support for (10+2)*5 [5]<p><pre><code>    [5] http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/11/procrastination-hack-1025</code></pre>",1377769027

6294984,comment,6292057,6294946,1,0,vidarh,,,"The use of premium numbers are heavily regulated because they are subject to a <i>lot</i> of scams. The main consideration is that the caller needs to be aware of the cost, and there needs to be a mechanism to handle complaints. I think the regulator is exaggerating here - &quot;eveyone&quot; knows that 0871 numbers are charged at a higher rate, and as long as he is prepared to answer complaints and doesn&#x27;t try to misrepresent the costs, he should be in the clear. For genuine companies it should not be a big deal - after all they happily call cellphones all the time.<p>Now, if he was using 070 numbers it&#x27;d be dicier. 070 numbers are notorious - they&#x27;re basically &quot;follow me&quot; numbers that can be rerouted wherever you want. Except they cost 40p per minute, which means there&#x27;s whole armies of women paid to hang out on chatlines and dating sites and drop 070 numbers to people because people confuse them with cellphone numbers (07x where x is 4 or above, though there are some other services like pagers too in that range).  In fact, the last time I saw a &quot;genuine&quot; 070 number was in 2000 or so.<p>As for your proposed service: While you can&#x27;t keep your number, in the UK you can certainly set up your own 09 number at 25p (I think) up 150p per minute, or 07 number at 40p, or the 0871 at 10p. The 09 numbers must play a recording, and most 0871 numbers will also play recordings to be on the safe side. I think that&#x27;s the closest you will get - in the UK the regulator will not allow premium charges outside of the designated ranges not just because of confusion but also because if you can have premium rates everywhere, then automated blocking of premium rate numbers becomes problematic - you&#x27;d have to create an API or something to check the rate, and have everyone who wants to block premium rate numbers update their PBX&#x27;s, and then it&#x27;s far simpler to just keep the numbering plan.",1377768261

He claimed it could pay for itself within a standard utility company&#x27;s financial planning horizon of 30 years.<p>And then oil prices went back to normal.<p>The real conceptual competitor at the time -- in fact, it&#x27;s still the real competitor -- is plain old fission.",1377767267

Why not make it part of a business model?<p>I should be able to get a number that costs extra to call. My time is valuable and anyone calling me should think twice whether the call is worth his money. And I don&#x27;t mean just telemarketers anyone. Getting my immediate attention should not be free or cheap, it should be expensive.<p>I am willing to share profits with my telco. I think telcos should make this a standard offering and let any number be switched to a premium one, with cost per minute set by the user. To avoid unexpected charges and subsequent problems they should play a recording while connecting (before actually charging for the connection), warning about the costs and explaining that holding will ring my phone and start accumulating charges.<p>If there was a telco offering that kind of service, I&#x27;d switch in a heartbeat.",1377767200

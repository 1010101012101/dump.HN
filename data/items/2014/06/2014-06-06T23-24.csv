Sedentary life style, increased stress, reduced sleep, \n&quot;western&quot; diet (highly inflammatory, with poor nutrient density), craving-inducing food, and messed up intestinal flora are just some of the things that likely contribute to obesity.<p>As someone who travels from US to Europe often, I always wonder what exactly it is that causes such dramatic difference.<p>Is it gluten, that&#x27;s been under scrutiny lately? It doesn&#x27;t seem to be so, since so many European countries are happily eating their bread. Although European-favored sourdough has been shown to positively affect intestinal flora through fermentation, unlike those puffy bread-like impostors you see in commercial stores in US.<p>Lifestyle doesn&#x27;t seem to differ much either, although Europeans definitely have a more sacred and slower approach to meals, and there&#x27;s less of that &quot;quick lunch in a rush&quot; culture.<p>However, portion size and difference in cooking oils (olive in EU vs. corn/cottonseed/canola/etc. in US) seem to stand out the most, and are probably the biggest offenders.

7860777,comment,7860040,7860040,3,0,BruceIV,,,"I love the idea, but bootstrapping is the real tricky bit with a site like this.<p>Putting aside the grant funding idea, I think you could really democratize academic publishing by adding a StackExchange-like rating system to something like ArXiv, and also building in a conference organization system (this part is actually key). You&#x27;d allow researchers to link off-site (even paywalled) content to their profiles (email to the address listed in the author list should be sufficient authentication), and bootstrap the rating system by granting reputation points in certain subfields to authors with recent publications in reputable conferences/journals. You get reputation by people who already have it positively reviewing your papers. The system gets papers by including a really good conference organization system (in-person networking is still very worthwhile, even if we solve the journal problems of distribution and peer review), which requires conference submissions to be put into the system, along with the reviewers comments. You&#x27;d fund the thing (and weed out junk submissions) by imposing a relatively nominal fee (say $50) for lifetime hosting.<p>Such a system is technically possible, but it would need to achieve critical mass to actually replace the existing journal system.<p>(I should mention I&#x27;m coming at this from the perspective of a computer science researcher - in a lot of the subfields of CS the most expensive parts of doing research are 1) your time and 2) institutional library access to get at the papers you need (Google Scholar helps here, but it&#x27;s far from perfect), so large grants are less essential than in disciplines that need expensive laboratory equipment or travel to exotic locations.)",1402097804

7860769,comment,7857889,7860698,1,0,tunesmith,,,"Well, you&#x27;re more explaining why not to mock, rather than what they mean by not mocking... but I have a hard time agreeing with this, for properly designed code.  Referring to my earlier example of B calling C, what if B&#x27;s business logic is complex, but makes no outbound calls except to C, and C (for simplicity&#x27;s sake) is also complex, but returns only a boolean result?<p>Mocking has real value there because you can control what C returns when testing B.  You might write tests for if C returns true, if C returns false, if C returns null, or if C returns some general exception.  There, you&#x27;re testing that B behaves correctly, given all possible responses from C.  At that point, you&#x27;ve controlled the interface between B and C, and limited the ways that C can respond.  Because of that, you can be sure that if your test for B fails, it&#x27;s because of a problem with B.<p>If you instead don&#x27;t mock C, then an integration test that tests both B and C (since B is actually calling C) becomes a lot more complex - probably more than twice as hard to nail down a bug.<p>The trick there is that by focusing on the unit test, you&#x27;ve written a clear, simple interface between B and C, when you might not have otherwise.  I think that&#x27;s an example of how mocking can really help, and how it doesn&#x27;t lead to the nightmare of mocks-calling-mocks that a lot of people seem to criticize.  And rather than being only useful in cases like protocol handshakes, it seems frequently useful, such as in wanting to mock a dao layer when testing a business logic layer.<p>At any rate, that makes it sound like by not mocking, they&#x27;re merely doing multi-level integration tests.  I just would have expected them to be more focused on unit tests, which to my mind requires mocking if you have a multi-layer application.<p>Jim W. made the same point about &quot;not mocking&quot; in his youtube video though... and in the same breath said that he <i>does</i>, however, mock at the boundaries.  Which makes me wonder if this is all just a terminology confusion.  Because for instance, if I&#x27;m testing a public method in business logic, I&#x27;m not going to mock the private methods that it calls in that same business logic layer - that just seems crazy to me.  And yet I would still call that a unit test, since it&#x27;s still limited to one layer, if not to one single-layer-of-abstraction method.  I will mock the dao layer in those cases, though, because that strikes me as a completely separate layer/concern.  But I don&#x27;t know, maybe someone else would say that I &quot;don&#x27;t mock all that often&quot;.",1402097563

No one would really be surprised by it happening, I think most of us have experienced it a time or two in our careers.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing:  No seasoned developer is going to recommend that you write a migration process, create a DB with purely dev created test data, and if it passes, immediately pass it into production/into the hands of customers.  Most experienced dev&#x27;s would tell you that&#x27;s dangerous, and you really need to test it against actual production data first.<p>In this case, the dev created test data is a &#x27;mock&#x27;, and the production data is &#x27;reality&#x27;.  In this context, no one would disagree that the dev created test data is not enough in order to ensure proper functioning.<p>But many people will tell you that a mock object is enough to ensure proper functioning.  This is not true, and the investment required in order to make it true tends to be a lot higher than people expect for the same reason that battle tested code tends to be more complicated than most people would expect is necessary to solve the problem.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that mocking doesn&#x27;t bring value, but because the cost of making that mock accurately mimic reality, it means you should reserve it for those times where the alternatives tend to be even more prohibitive.<p>This is why you&#x27;ll see a lot of recommendations for using mocks to do things like simulate failed connections at specific points in a protocol handshake.  Getting the connection to break at the correct time using an actual network is prohibitively difficult.  Getting a mock to do it consistently at the right time is a lot easier to do.<p>These are the sorts of situations that mocks were originally created to solve.  The issue is that somewhere along the line people started abusing mocks in situations that did not warrant them either because the cost of actually getting it correct is too high, or because they didn&#x27;t actually pay the cost resulting in a false sense of security.<p>I don&#x27;t think any reasonable developer will tell you that mocks are worthless, but I also don&#x27;t think any reasonable developer will tell you that you should be mocking a whole lot.",1402096212

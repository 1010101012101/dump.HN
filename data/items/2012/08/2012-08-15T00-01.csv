4383879,comment,4383159,4383759,1,0,wonderzombie,,,"I'm not <i>quite</i> sure I understand your point, but you're disagreeing with the above quote whereas I agree wholeheartedly with the quote.<p>Compare a language which forces you to write this<p><pre><code>    ll = []
    for x in xx:
      if bar(x):
        ll.append(x)
</code></pre>
This is Python, but imagine you're doing this in Java or C++ instead. Every time you read a for loop, you have to re-derive what the author intended. Are they just iterating? Are they composing a new list? Remember, these loops are often more than just two lines and they are common.<p>Contrast the above with<p><pre><code>    ll = [x for x in xx if bar(x)]
</code></pre>
Or even (in Haskell)<p><pre><code>    filter bar xx
</code></pre>
When your language gives you primitives to talk at a higher level, you can write more crisply and concisely. The simple, trivial code you've written 1e9 times is replaced by a very clear, simple definition of what you're doing. The important code, the <i>interesting</i> code may now speak for itself.",1344992127

-- Volumetric measurements for petroleum products and dairy products
-- Taxi meters
-- other commerce tools (grocery store scanners, change machines, bottle/can refund machines, etc)<p>It's a truism that weight is a much more accurate way to specify products than volume, which is why even liquids like self-serve soup at the grocery store are sold by mass, not volume.<p>However, we are historically used to buying gasoline, milk and ice cream by the gallon or liter, not the pound or kilo.  It's also interesting that milk and ice cream are the fluids mentioned besides petroleum products in the state code -- we give dairy products a very special place in our culture.

I looked back at the world where no such regulations existed, and I didn't see a perfect market which quickly and efficiently eradicated charlatans and thieves.  No, instead I saw a world where people were constantly being preyed upon by the guiled class. I saw a world where the only people you could really trust were those in your close personal circle, and every transaction with a 3rd party, new or known, was rife with risk.<p>The ""regulatory state"" didn't come about as a predicted social experiment, it came about by constantly reacting to an endless stream of malfeasance that constantly stood to wreck any possibility of a functioning free market.<p>Cities and states regulating measurements and fare mechanisms are generally a -good- thing, even when it affects some darling company.  For every darling company that wants us to ""just trust them to do the right thing, they're good Silicon Valley-types,"" there are a dozen would-be scamsters plotting how they can take advantage of similar models to make free money. The constant ""free market response"" is ""Oh, well, people will just shop somewhere else.""  Yes, after having lost their money (some times many, many people losing their money) AND their trust in any company like the same.<p>The world of figuring cab fares doesn't exactly need to be ""turned on its head,"" it's a well-established practice of livery that's been going back for hundreds of years (perhaps more - I don't know the complete history).  Yes, new technology can make it more efficient, but how inefficient is the current system exactly?  Is it worth the risk?  This is what local communities ask themselves.  Why should one company be granted the permissions to step outside of the decision process and state they don't want to follow the community rules?<p>Every action by a government, and most especially inaction (failure to regulate) picks winners and losers.  Failing to regulate pollution levels, cab fares, food safety, etc. make winners out of moderately unscrupulous types and moderately scrupulous types.  Certain forms of regulations can make winners out of either the highly scrupulous, or the highly unscrupulous.<p>Nothing tastes bad to me about not letting cabs just use their iphones to automatically calculate fares from unmonitored and unvetted software.  It makes it harder for Uber to make money?  Well crap, cry me a river, it's better than making it easier on the thieves - society has chosen that path over millennia.",1344991475

4383789,comment,4383620,4383620,12,0,tokenadult,,,"I pondered posting this link to Hacker News, after seeing it on my Facebook feed from a friend's wall. The Hacker News welcome message distills the basic rules into a simple statement: ""Essentially there are two rules here: don't post or upvote crap links, and don't be rude or dumb in comment threads.""<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html</a><p>Well, maybe it's a bit harsh to describe the link kindly submitted here (which I almost submitted myself) as a ""crap link,"" but at least it is fair to say that the link submitted here is a rant, not a carefully reasoned analysis of the history of the issue. Nor is the link a prescription for building a sustainable model for higher education in the United States that benefits all citizens in general.<p>Let's look at the propositions implicit in the submitted article's five easy steps for killing American universities.<p>""First, you defund public higher education.""<p>But actually the funding of higher education around the world has been the subject of much study by many economists of education of many nationalities, and the consistent finding is that the greatest access to the greatest quality of higher education for the greatest number of young people is to have a mixed system of some universities being wholly privately operated, perhaps with some public subsidies for students to attend them, along with some universities being government-operated, usually with substantial revenue from student tuition fees and research grants, and a variety of list prices from high to low, with a variety of subsidies from high to low. The United States model, by comparison with some other high-access, high-quality countries in higher education, has tended historically to be too high on the taxpayer-funded subsidy side. That takes money (as taxes) from the families of the working poor who will never attend college and transfers it to the families of college-educated parents whose children then enjoy leisure while pursuing higher education. Higher education that really makes a difference for the learner can be privately financed by the learner making use of creditworthiness (of either the learner personally or of the learner's family) to shift spending on education to the present while paying back the spending in the future from an increased income.<p>""Second, you deprofessionalize and impoverish the professors (and continue to create a surplus of underemployed and unemployed Ph.D.s)""<p>I challenge the statement that any professor is genuinely ""impoverished."" This is at best hyperbole, not description. Professors are well off people compared to most adults. If Ph.D. holders are unemployed, it can only be because they are clueless about the private sector job market,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4373983"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4373983</a><p>which is where most of the jobs are, and if the Ph.D. holders are that clueless, how well can they be providing education to the callow youth in their care?<p>""Step #3: You move in a managerial/administrative class who take over governance of the university.""<p>To date, most university administrators in all universities of the land continue to be academics, the kind of people who have the postgraduate degrees needed to be professors. If some of those people in addition have acumen in organizing academic programs, raising funds for the university, convincing bright students to apply to and enroll in the university, and so on, what is the problem? How can an academic, on the one hand, say that specialized knowledge of teaching in higher education is important (as most do) and that specialized knowledge of [insert academic subject here] is important for professors in each of their particular cases, and not say that specialized knowledge of university administration is important for university administrators?<p>""Step Four: You move in corporate culture and corporate money""<p>A certain amount of money from business corporations has been flowing into universities for a long time. To date, I see no evidence that many universities have a culture just like that of a business corporation. Academia and the private for-profit sector still have rather different approaches to problem-solving (and problem IDENTIFICATION) and different internal incentives for workers. Students in a free country will choose universities on the basis of what culture best serves the students, just as donors will choose recipients of donations on the basis of what recipient behavior best makes them feel good for donating. The submitted article's claim that corporate money makes a receiving university a ""whore of corporatism,"" but that claim could be legitimately rephrased to say that accepting some corporate donations, from each of many corporations, puts universities in touch with the real world and helps students have employment opportunities throughout the economy. Companies in competition with one another frequently have to keep a sharper focus on reality than ivory towers protected from meaningful competition.<p>""Step Five  Destroy the Students""<p>Well, cry me a river. Come on now, I have lived in the Third World, soon after being a college student who worked my way through my state university in the 1970s, and the life of today's university student in the United States is LAVISH compared to the life of most young people around the world. Here I'll excerpt my longest direct quotation from the submitted article:<p>""This is accomplished through a two-prong tactic: you dumb down and destroy the quality of the education so that no one on campus is really learning to think, to question, to reason. Instead, they are learning to obey, to withstand tests and exams, to follow rules, to endure absurdity and abuse. Our students have been denied full-time available faculty, the ability to develop mentors and advisors, faculty-designed syllabi which changes each semester, a wide variety of courses and options. Instead, more and more universities have core curriculum which dictates a large portion of the course of study, in which the majority of classes are administrative-designed common syllabi courses, taught by an army of underpaid, part-time faculty in a model that more closely resembles a factory or the industrial kitchen of a fast food restaurant than an institution of higher learning.""<p>My response to the first prong is that a well educated student who has received only SECONDARY schooling ought to be able to ""think, to question, to reason."" If students are entering university unable to do those things (and the submitted article's claim appears to be that they are) at adult age, then perhaps there is a problem in United States education, but it is a problem K-12 education, not in university education. Anyone admitted to university education ought to be able to ""think, to question, to reason.""<p>""The Second Prong: You make college so insanely unaffordable that only the wealthiest students from the wealthiest of families can afford to go to the school debt free.""<p>College is eminently affordable to a great many students in the United States. There is still to this day a large taxpayer-funded public sector of higher education with amazingly low list prices. Work opportunities for college students still abound, even in a high-unemployment economy. Of course not everyone obtains a higher education degree without going into debt (as I took care to do decades ago). But, again, borrowing money for higher education is a good idea if higher education provides value to the student. The problem here really seems to be a shopping problem. If students are not taking care to match the cost of college to their means of paying for college (as I did in my day), they should look for college majors that have positive economic return. (My oldest son was able to put money in the bank each semester of college enrollment, even in the current college cost environment, because he learned a lot as a secondary school student and was able to gain academic scholarships. Then he found he could gain a lot of part-time and summer work during college because of the skills he had already developed. College need not impose debt on students.)<p>The article sums up by saying, ""Within one generation, in five easy steps, not only have the scholars and intellectuals of the country been silenced and nearly wiped out, but the entire institution has been hijacked, and recreated as a machine through which future generations will ALL be impoverished, indebted and silenced."" I call baloney on this statement. The scholars and intellectuals of the country HAVE NOT been silenced--indeed, changing the mix of funding of higher education in the United States so that more payment comes from the families of college students and less from taxpayers in general who will never attend college is a social justice GAIN over the system that existed when I was in college.

In exchange, they are required to pick up ANY passenger when on duty (they cannot legally decline to drive you somewhere), and they are required to charge you pre-determined rates as measured by a pre-determined meter.<p><i>Livery</i>, or ""black sedan"" services, are not permitted to pick up arbitrary passengers who are hailing a cab.  However, they are also not required (or allowed) to have a medallion, and they are not bound by any metering or pricing regulations at all.<p>I believe the theoretical distinction is that when hailing a cab, you are in a position of no negotiating power - you are limited to whatever cabs happen to drive by.  ""Being able to hail a cab"" is a public utility.  So the city has pre-negotiated a generally acceptable contract.<p>In contrast, you (pre-2012) are negotiating a contract with a livery company.  You can choose any livery service you want from a phone book or directory, you can ask about their rates, pick a specific time, perhaps choose the type of car, etc.  There's no ""certified"" locked meter, because the price is something you negotiate, and you have a choice of vendors.<p>Here's where Uber flips the industry on its head.  Medallion owners tolerated livery companies, because without the medallion, livery services were restricted to pre-arranged rides, and most livery services couldn't offer a large enough fleet to provide low dispatch times without advance notice.<p>Uber forms a communications network linking ANY interested livery driver with ANY interested passenger.  You pre-arrange the ride, but you pre-arrange it minutes before pickup. And Uber provides an Internet-era dispatch system; they've replaced grumpy dispatchers, two-way radios, and kickback systems with two iPhones (yours and the driver's) with built-in GPS.  They can route your ""call"" directly to the closest in-network driver.  Uber isn't a florist; they're FTD.<p>As far as I can tell, Massachusetts doesn't have any statewide regulation of livery services; each town has its own rules.  Worcester apparently had a ""12-hour rule"" that defined what qualifies as a ""pre-arranged ride"", but that's been suspended or something.<p>So IANAL, but here's the situation as I see it:<p>- Uber isn't operating a livery service, period.  They provide a dispatching network that's used by licensed livery drivers.
- Livery drivers don't have to use any kind of meter.  They charge a negotiated price.  With an Uber driver, you have negotiated a price based on ""mileage as the iPhone GPS records it"".<p>Which gets back to ""which measurement devices used in trade are regulated in Massachusetts""?

4383757,comment,4381371,4381824,3,0,jackcviers3,,,"The problem with commenting code is that code is constantly refactored to deal with new invariants and edge-cases. What starts out as a great way to summarize the purpose and mechanics of a given function or statement becomes immediately stale once the function or statement is changed. In the best case, the comments are revised along with the code they describe.<p>However, everyone makes mistakes, as you  have pointed out, and once a comment is forgotten during refactoring, that comment has become a liability to the future maintenance or use of the code it describes. Given that comments are, by definition, not executable lines of code, commenting errors do not show up in code execution. Since most bugs only become apparent because of incorrect execution, commenting bugs are difficult to spot. This is a problem when developers read the comment instead of the code to discover the purpose and mechanics of the commented function or statement, and can lead to further errors in client code of the function or statement when the called code doesn't conform to the specifications expressed in the comment.<p>Now the developer who has to fix the code has two things to debug; the code as it is written and the code as it is described in the comment. Which has authority? How do you prove the correctness of a comment?<p>You can prove the correctness of code, because it can be executed. You can test it using the scientific method, trace its execution paths at runtime and by reading the calling code. You cannot do this with comments.<p>Additionally, every line of source code is a liability to the maintenance of the code. Each line out source adds computational and mental complexity to the program they describe.<p>For these reasons, good, verbose variable and function names to describe the what, and corresponding tests to describe the how and why are superior ways to describe code over verbose comments.<p>However",1344989695

4383721,comment,4383243,4383553,32,0,FooBarWidget,,,"I'm sorry, but shell scripts <i>suck</i> as a language for booting the system. You need to fork() and exec() for almost anything non-trivial, wasting precious CPU cycles in the progress. It looks like every Linux distro has its own way to manage boot scripts. And when they fail, you have no idea what happened.<p>More importantly, init only handles <i>starting and stopping</i> of services. They don't <i>manage</i> services, like restarting them when they crash. Systemd can do that. The socket activation stuff also allows one to potentially save resources by not starting services until they're really needed.<p>The best way to reduce boot times is to not boot? Have you ever heard of ""laptops"" and ""average users""? Even on my servers, a shorter boot time is welcome.",1344989147

Editing code written in those so called free form readable languages is absolute pain compared to structured editing in paredit. It is a reason to program in Lisps by itself. You don't need that filter on your data? Easy, you just need one keystroke (M-r) to raise the inner expression. Everyone should experience it, it certainly makes me want to write more and more code in Clojure.",1344989146

I totally agree with their premise that current games are limited by the touch functionality. If they can bring the price down and just get to a medium-sized installed base, their free app will work wonders for small indie-sized devs.  Current game devs are being priced out of the market for advertising, but if they can innovate on the discovery end, they could become a low-cost Xbox competitor with a much larger catalog of games.",1344989015
4383714,comment,4383001,4383001,5,0,briggsbio,,,"This is one of those ""wow, so perfectly obvious no one has never done it."" This could (and probably should) the hiring process at many retail and service jobs. In my teens I would have been all about proving myself by taking whatever quiz or prescreening training available to get the job. This could have micro impacts on allowing the most tenacious to get the job rather than the most experience, which for the level of jobs they're focusing on initially could be a positive force. Just imagine if Wal-Mart was filled with the most proactive, not just the one with 6 months more of register experience. Certainly many caveats to these statements, but with some evolution and execution this could have really important impacts on the way low-level wage employment is conducted. The interesting aspects would be to see it move up the org chart.
Also love the customer development of them walking the unemployment lines to understand the market.",1344988986

We look back and find a few contributing factors, put them in a pile, and call it a theory, and believe we understand it.<p>But does that theory actually limit what we'd predict about the future?  Does it retroactively predict <i>all</i> the past data that we've seen?  As you pointed out, Lisp <i>was</i> quite popular for a bit.<p>What if we just said, Lisp isn't popular because it didn't get/stay lucky?<p>That anti-theory isn't quite as satisfying, but at least it doesn't pretend at knowledge that it doesn't have.<p>One really nice thing, in my opinion, about JavaScript programmers is that they don't sit around kvetching about why the wrong language won.  We all know it was a fluke, but the fluke happened, and here we are, so you can either squawk about languages, or get real things done instead, and improve the tools and software that you have.",1344988973

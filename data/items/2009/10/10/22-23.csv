Let me assure<p>> you, your data IS gone. Currently MS is trying to get the devices to sync the<p>> data they have back to the service as a form of recovery.<p>> It's not a server failure. They were upgrading their SAN, and they outsourced<p>> it to a Hitachi consulting firm. There was room for a backup of the data on<p>> the SAN, but they didn't do it (some say they started it but didn't wait for<p>> it to complete). They upgraded the SAN, screwed it up and lost all the data.<p>> All the apps in the developer store are gone too.<p>> This is surely the end of Danger. I only hope it's the end of those involved<p>> who screwed this up and the MS folks who laid off and drove out anyone at<p>> Danger who knew what they were doing.",1255215487

Once in a while, things fail; when it happens to you and you control the data, you spend those few hours fixing whatever's wrong.  When your data are in someone else's hands, you sit around writing angry tweets about it until it's fixed.<p>In the worst case, maybe you'll lose up to 24 hours of changes in case a backup needs to be restored.<p>For the data to be <i>lost</i> entirely, with no backup whatsoever, simply beggars belief.",1255215348
873987,comment,873617,873617,0,0,Bluem00,,,"We have 4 developers sitting in a room with a giant white board. When someone discovers a bug, or one is reported to us, we write a few words or a sentence up on the board; enough so that we'll be reminded what its about. When a developer decides to fix one of the bugs, they stick their initials next to it and check it off when completed, which signals to someone else that it needs to be tested and erased.<p>The goals of our bug tracker are to get bugs fixed and tested quickly, with the main goal of having no known bugs in the system. Specifically, we realized that most tracking systems are optimized for bug archival, whereas we wanted a system which is optimized for getting the bugs fixed, given our environment.<p>I've found that I have a very strong preference for an empty bug-tracking whiteboard, and the more items on it, the more I feel compelled to fix bugs rather than work on other things. It's great for communication, because you can just go talk about the item on the board. Even the process of marking something off on the board makes everyone else peripherally aware that something changed, so nobody has to check whether there's something for them to fix/test - they know. Often bugs are fixed and tested within the same day they're discovered. If something stays on the board for a while it's obvious to everyone that there's a more serious issue that we need to discuss.",1255215262

It was an amazing email/texting device, far easier and more comfortable to use than a Blackberry.  Plus the web browsing was decent, and the UI was simple and elegant.  All in all, a really cool phone.<p>Unfortunately, the first generation of hardware was super flaky.  I had five of them die on me in a year, often failing within weeks.  Since there wasn't any PC sync tool, the only thing that saved my bacon was the server-side data model.  When a phone died, I'd get a replacement, drop in the SIM card and all my stuff would be there same as always.<p>Back in the day, there was no data sync with your PC.  I think they eventually released Outlook syncronization, but most consumers don't use Exchange/Outlook.  I would guarantee that a huge number of Sidekick owners (most? all?) have never had any of their phone data anywhere but the Danger servers.<p>To make matters worse, the Sidekick becomes kind of a brick when the servers are down.  I can see a lot of people resetting their device because it's suddenly become unresponsive, just expecting their data to magically come back from the server.<p>This is an unmitigated disaster.",1255214617

What's worse is that apparently Microsoft has been lying to them this whole time about the amount of resources that they've been putting behind Sidekick development and support (in reality, it was cut down to a handful of people in Palo Alto managing some contractors in Romania, Ukraine, etc.).<p>""The reason for the deceit wasn't purely to cover up the development of Pink but also because Microsoft could get more money from T-Mobile for their support contract if T-Mobile thought that there were still hundreds of engineers working on the Sidekick platform.

873927,comment,873882,873882,0,0,jsz0,,,"The timing of this is a bit suspicious. I just read an article late last week from an ""insider"" detailing what a major clusterfuck the Danger acquisition has been for Microsoft and how they've completely neglected the SideKick platform in favor of their own failed attempts to create a competing device. The speculation from this insider being that Microsoft had zero interest in the NetBSD based SideKick and only bought Danger to kill the SideKick and launch their own product to replace it. Most of the original developers are long gone so that makes me wonder who was taking care of the SideKick backend servers. Are they perhaps UNIX based servers? Did Microsoft perhaps throw a bunch of Windows Server guys at them? (that never ends well)",1255212297

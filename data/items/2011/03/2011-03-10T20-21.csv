Men, from my understanding, seem to place a higher value on the physical attractiveness of their mates, and a lower value on the perceived social status of their mates.<p>Not that I'm an expert on selling or dating;  it's just that most of the dating advice I've seen women given has to do with becoming more physically attractive, rather than the advice given to men, which seems to be about raising one's perceived social status.   I mean, it could be that the advice (or my perception of that advice) is wrong, but it lines up with my personal observations.<p>This ignoring the vast differences between initiating short-term relationships and maintaining a long-term relationship, and the differences between selling a product and initiating a relationship.<p>(Oh, and thanks for being a customer.

2310735,comment,2309609,2310589,0,0,pavlov,,,"I suspect that the top management at Nokia got stuck with the old idea that networks are the strategically important technology in their business. They always seemed to treat software as basically ""the boring last part when outsourced peons implement feature checklists"" rather than anything strategic.<p>When you look at where Nokia was coming from, the emphasis on devices and network tech made sense. They bet the whole company on GSM in the early '90s and reaped amazing rewards. (Finland was the first country in the world with a GSM network, which gave Nokia a nice push into the market that would explode to billions of customers worldwide.)<p>In the late '90s, networks were similarly a matter of corporate life and death as the European companies battled Qualcomm and the Japanese over the fate of 3G. Meanwhile Nokia was essentially outsourcing their core software. Symbian was set up as a separate corporation in Britain. Maemo was an underfunded Linux skunkworks operation in Brazil.<p>Nokia didn't even care enough to do the Series 60 user experience design themselves. Instead, this crucial task was outsourced to a German company (I think they were called Mango Design). With nobody in the company fighting for the UX vision, it's not difficult to see how it got so neglected.",1299790544

The built in Safari has great physics reactions and overall nice and speedy. The UIWebView is very flakey on scrolling (this was I guess version 3 something when I was messing with it). In general, the rendering I found to be rather different at subtle CSS settings. The same page in Safari would act one way, whereas UIWebView would render it differently. Now lets talk same origin policy. Android and iPhone both honor this as they should, but at the time I was developing, iPhone even enacted this for XML calls. If you did an XML call on the Obj-C side, from a remote server, it would not let you mix that data with your local served web page resources. Now the biggest thing is this point some of dev friends are making that there's a new performant javascript interpreter, but it is hands off to the developer. Another avenue I tried was to access iframes, from a foreign server, with javascript, ala greasemonkey ... no go there. The origin policy is enforced because the page running your javascript is locally hosted. I love the origin policy for general web use, but if I'm designing a browser more or less, it shouldn't apply. I would also think this is safe because UIWebView seems to support having its own history, cookies, etc, so it isn't like I'm trying to sniff what else the user might be doing elsewhere. So far in my android dev experience this all just works, and I'm even given a WebKit class to work with.",1299788685

Until I read your blog, I was a firm believer in losing? Maybe it was because I was striving to be as mediocre as possible, rather than... ""excellent""?<p>Actually, maybe not you, but I think a lot of the modern world is fundamentally anti-excellence. Maybe America less than most places, but a lot of the world Tall Poppy Syndrome going on -<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome</a><p>A Swedish friend of mine is a talented mathematician, professional poker player, and was a highly competitive athlete before a shoulder injury derailed him. He said he got all kinds of negativity and abuse and people really <i>hating</i> him for what he did, despite the fact that he's like the nicest, kindest, friendliest person I know. He says they have this phrase for it in Sweden -<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jante_Law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jante_Law</a><p>So yeah. I think a lot of the world is actually anti-winning, anti-excellence. Look how rich are always portrayed in movies. They're always the bad guys. Look at how the star players get booed. Look at how people cheer against the New York Yankees just because it's a successful and extremely well-run organization that wins.<p>> I'm not trying to be a wiseass (well, maybe a little), but do you see what I'm getting at?<p>I understand. Most people don't realize that things are like this because it's so normal. But if you seriously break the mold and go counter-mainstream/counter-culture, you're going to get serious abuse from people. Almost everyone that breaks the mold does. I think that's garbage, that ambition should be celebrated, that achievement should be celebrated, etc.<p>I also spend a lot of time working on various time tracking and habits and reading lots of science and things like that, but that more pedestrian stuff never really gets spread around the internet - so if you only see my site on an occasional one that climbs HN or Twitter retweet, you're probably seeing the more controversial/aggressive stuff. I'm a believer in hard work and putting the time in too, I'm not a fan of rah-rah-go-go.<p>But to answer your question, yeah, I think a lot of the world is fundamentally anti-excellence, anti-standing-out. And I think that's bad.",1299788547

From an employment angle that's not too far fetched -<p>me, age 9, after typing in a ZX Spectrum animation/macro:<p><pre><code>    I know BASIC.

me, age 22, after writing a few scripts for Office software:<p><pre><code>    I'm proficient in Visual Basic.

And in neither case did I really know how wrong I was... You could definitely hire a lot of 'computer users' who have no real understanding of programming abstractions, and have never met a real developer.",1299787559

You want to appear indifferent to any particular sale for the same reason that playing hard to get works in dating:  It implies that you are desirable/successful enough to pick and choose your partners.<p>These strategies take advanage of humans' built-in decision making and survival heuristics.  Women like a man who's already taken because they can assume that his current mate has already extensively vetted him for desirability.  Anyone who smells desperate trips alarms and gets you wondering why they can't find a mate / job /client.<p>There's a fine line between putting your best foot forward and cynically manipulating everyone around you of course.

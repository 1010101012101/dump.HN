There are lots of bad contracts out there because there aren't many clients willing to pay a lawyer to re-engineer poorly written contracts that are nonetheless believed to ""work,"" i.e. be interpreted by a court in a predictable manner.  Every experienced coder has seen the same phenomenon:  if a body of code has been written, re-written, and patched over time, it probably looks pretty awful now and could stand a good deal of refactoring, but does anyone do that?  Witness the OP, who apparently found a form somewhere and is trying to edit it to his purposes.<p>It's not like contracts are written in a secret language.  There is a background body of knowledge that is helpful to have in writing and reading them, but it is also crucial to understand the industry involved.",1239969526

566718,comment,566565,566640,0,0,seertaak,,,"> ... without added value.<p>I think this allegation betokens a certain ignorance of how the music industry works. Firstly, producers, recording engineers and assistants, mixing engineers, and mastering engineers certainly do add value -- where ""value"" is defined in the narrow artistic sense. These roles are certainly part of the ""Phonographic Industry"".<p>In addition, just because record labels, promoters, publishers, managers, and agents, etc. don't \n""create"" music doesn't mean they don't add value. When they do their job well -- which, granted, is not always the case -- they allow the artist(s) to focus solely on the music, rather than on tasks which they're not particularly suited to, like organizing international, multi-leg tours, getting ads on billboards, doing distribution deals with the likes of iTunes, Spotify, and the traditional music retailers, plugging artists' music into commercial radio stations. Record labels also act as a quasi insurance policy for artists; by using a portion of the revenue streams from ""hit"" and established artists, they can finance new acts. There is <i>certainly</i> value to that. Jazz music was, after all, only a niche art form known to very few before Norman Granz's efforts to popularize it. In this sense, while he was certainly no Miles Davis or Bird, his work had an immense impact on generations of listeners. (I'd add that in an age of segregation and prejudice against blacks, he stuck his neck out to sign them, and insisted on equal pay for all colours and genders -- see wikipedia) Again: no value?<p>I find it curious that the tech-savvy world of Hacker News, which should be comfortable with the idea of specialization in modern capitalist economies, seems to pine for a return to a ""cottage"" music industry, where the musician is to perform all of the afore-mentioned roles himself. Am I alone in thinking this would be a step back, rather than forward?<p>Sadly, in order for this system to work, people need to pay for records (but obviously, they should be <i>much</i> cheaper than in the heady 90s days). I therefore applaud the Swedish courts for upholding the rule of law and holding the facilitators of rampant piracy accountable for their actions -- which <i>have</i>, unquestionably, led to much misery for many low-level, up-and-coming musicians (myself included ;)",1239969437

566701,comment,560882,566060,0,0,op12,,,"> Why shouldn't they lose money for taking bad counter-party risks?<p>I don't really know how else to explain this. They shouldn't lose money for taking counter party risk...because they were willing to pay the price to insure themselves on the counter party risk. Why do you keep insisting that they need to lose money? They had 7.5 in collateral, and they insured themselves for the other 2.5 in the event they defaulted. This is the definition of protecting yourself from bad counter-party risks.<p>> They were planning to keep the money that they made for assuming said risks, so why shouldn't they take the hit when things work out badly?<p>...because they insured themselves. Imagine someone who bought a share of Google stock and then also bought a put option on it to protect themselves. Then the stock goes down. It's like asking why that person shouldn't take the hit because they were going to keep the money if Google had gone up. Goldman doesn't take the hit because 1) they were prudently collateralized and 2) they PAID for CDS protection on the rest that was owed to them that was not collateralized. CDS is not free, of course.<p>If they were willing to pay the insurance and demand collateral, why should they have to take a hit at all?<p>> I'll pay $7.5B for $10B.<p>So would I, but this is obviously a mischaracterization. It's like a homeowner who defaults on their mortgage and gives a house worth 250k to the bank who lent them 500k to buy it. They are not ""paying 250 for 500"".<p>> Maybe, maybe not, but in any event, not by the US govt.<p>This is not really a maybe, maybe not situation. Clearly with the collateral and insurance arranagements, Goldman would not have lost money as a counterparty to AIG. If you have an explanation otherwise I would be interested to hear it.",1239968836

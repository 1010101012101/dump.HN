On one end of the spectrum, CPM models put ALL of the risk onto the advertiser, and CPA is at the other, putting ALL of the risk onto the publisher.  CPC falls in the middle.<p>Depending on who has more leverage in the negotiation, what is possible for one advertiser may not be possible for another.  But given the low-quality traffic I&#x27;ve seen on some publishers, and specific instances where I know publishers were arbitraging $.01 CPC clicks into their inventory counts, I&#x27;m not at ALL surprised they are clinging to CPM as long as they can.  Their very existence depends on it.<p>High-quality publishers have little problem going with CPA in cases where they can control more of the funnel (which is often the weak link), and they can command a much higher spread as a result.",1415311027

I gamble that they&#x27;re in RAID 1 - most typical - and strip one out while the server is still running. Some kernel messages are logged, whatever.<p>- I start imaging the disk. If it isn&#x27;t a mirror of the other after all, I strip the remaining drive(s) out and start imaging them too.<p>- While the disk(s) is/are transferring, I patch both your boot loader and your kernel with a rootkit. This should be laughably easy for the level of adversary we&#x27;re talking about.<p>- When the disk(s) are done, I power cycle your server. I may cold-boot your RAM and get the passphrases there if i&#x27;m lucky. The downtime was either seconds (if it kept going with one RAID 1 disk) or <however long the imaging takes>.<p>- When you realise your service is down you may contact customer support. In that case they will respond (with their usual timing) about something-something-blown-fuse-UPS in your rack.<p>- When you log onto your server, you will most likely be faced with the passphrase input and most likely will go for it, but even if you don&#x27;t...<p>> I&#x27;d compare the bootloader to a known good image as an early boot step<p>If you do so after you&#x27;ve given away the passphrase, you&#x27;ve lost already. Destroying the data won&#x27;t help, as they have the encrypted copy of it and you just gave them the key.<p>I don&#x27;t think you could detect a good boot/OS rootkit remotely at all. One would cover for the other. You can&#x27;t unplug the disk and examine it. You can&#x27;t plug a read-only drive in and boot some forensic tool. All you have is your lying bootloader and your lying OS. Your encrypted partition doesn&#x27;t protect the integrity of the binaries there either, as after it&#x27;s been decrypted, the rootkit would happily intercept any values that would give it away.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you could ensure hardware security without ensuring physical security. Usually, physical access == pwned. Maybe TPM changes/will change that, but I somehow doubt it. Some other routes not covered here (probably easier, heh): Getting host to decrypt your TLS/KVM session where you typed the passphrase in the first place, malware in firmware on misc devices, etc.",1415310897

So why isn&#x27;t there any attention given to companies that, given a couple years of salaries for a few technically competent founders, could reliably and sustainably deliver 20-40% growth over the next couple of decades?</i><p>I don&#x27;t see this. I do see a lot of companies founded by a couple technically competent cofounders, who spend two years on the project, and end up nowhere. Building software is high risk because there is much competition and the landscape is changing so fast. If you have product ideas that are low risk, feel free to share ... :-) Some of those products end up as successful, cash-cow small businesses. Some show traction, end up taking venture money, grow at 200% for a couple years before de-accelerating to a more sustainable 20% growth rate.<p>Also, it is exceptionally rare for a software product to grow sustainably over multiple decades. You usually are the best product for a given platform, and you take off, and you remain hot for five to ten years while that platform is hot. Or you are an also-ran and don&#x27;t see enough traction to be sustainable at all.<p>It should also be noted that while Snapchat and these hyper-growth consumer apps get the headlines, most startups do not have that trajectory (and are not designed to have that trajectory). The trajectory for most companies is spend one to three years building a product and getting to product market fit, spend a couple years at 100-300% annual growth as your product breaks through, and then decelerate gradually down to 20% growth, where you last until a new platform comes along and disrupts you. (A good company will be able to disrupt itself, and build new successful products, bad companies will decline and self-liquidate).<p>One big hole in the investment scene is that it is very hard for first-time founders to get seed investment pre-product and pre-traction. You basically either have to bootstrap, get into YC, have connections, or get very lucky and meet an angel who is in love with the vision. That said, angel investors are probably making the economically correct choice in not funding these founders, so I&#x27;m not sure what could be done about it.<p>I am curious if you have examples of the types of 20-40% sustained growth businesses that could exist, but don&#x27;t get funded. I don&#x27;t see those kind of opportunities, but maybe I am missing out.",1415310661

Happy to answer questions.<p>One of the most interesting things we&#x27;ve learned about recently is the temptation to cut corners using cheaper parts or processes or relaxed quality control procedures. It&#x27;s easy to get quoted prices much lower than what we currently pay, but the long-term cost of choosing those parts (greater failure rates, manufacturing problems, and warranty costs, not to mention unhappy customers) is hard to quantify at decision time.<p>This is where experienced supply chain and hardware engineers are especially valuable.  They understand the implications of these decisions and know the right way to account for them.  For example, major manufacturers set aside &quot;warranty accruals&quot; as liabilities in their financials to cover the average future cost of servicing a unit that ships today.<p>I suspect this is a problem facing many hardware startups, Kickstarted or not.  It feels non-intuitive to build hardware carefully and at such high initial costs, especially in the &quot;move fast&quot; culture of software development.  And it&#x27;s especially dangerous if a company goes &quot;in the red&quot; without realizing it by shipping many units that may fail or incur high warranty costs that exceed the margin on the product, but at a later date.",1415309992

You&#x27;d hope that your friends would search for you, but most people are just too busy with their own lives to exert too much effort when it&#x27;s not their problem.<p>He was someone with over a thousand Facebook friends, but no one seemed to notice that he stopped posting. The first few months he was missing, his friends continued to send him invites to parties, events, etc. As time when on and he didn&#x27;t respond, they naturally stopped sending invites. A few friends sent emails saying, &quot;Hey, I haven&#x27;t seen you in a while. I&#x27;m worried. Call me.&quot; Eventually they too stopped. All it took was a matter of months before people stopped to reach out.<p>When news broke that he was first missing, his friends seemed more annoyed than anything. I suppose most of them thought this was a hoax (not that he&#x27;s ever done anything like this before). They were reluctant to be bothered, to break up their day to simply answer a few questions the detectives had to paint a better picture of my brother. I don&#x27;t blame them too much, no one wants additional drama in their lives.<p>Of course, the scenario will be unique for everyone. Everyone has a different group of friends, different resources. Unfortunately for me, I was blocked. I practically had access to all his accounts with the help of his girl friend, but at the end of the day, I couldn&#x27;t get a subpoena to see if there were any deleted gmail or facebook messages.

I&#x27;d be surprised if municipalities in need of water treatment plant upgrades aren&#x27;t looking at technologies that weren&#x27;t widely available 20 or 30 years ago when the original system was put into place.<p>Also, complaining about increasing price (which is modest IME) is an unusual tactic. The price would have to increase at a greater rate than inflation in order to account for the increasing concentration of wealth the past couple decades right? It&#x27;s a little fuzzy for me, but I feel like that&#x27;s just math. If 95% of your subscribers make less than they did two decades ago, but your per-subscriber bill is the same, then average cost is going to increase.<p>Also tightened environmental standards that didn&#x27;t exist in 80&#x27;s when the systems were put into place undoubtedly play a role in increasing costs.<p>I get 200amp service to my house today. It originally (in the 70&#x27;s) had 100amp service. I&#x27;d call doubling the power requirements for the electrical grid quite an upgrade. Houses are most certainly increasing in size. Not to mention 20 years ago you didn&#x27;t have the option to pay an extra half-cent per kWh to ensure the electric company purchased enough renewable power wholesale to cover your usage.<p>I pay all my utilities online with auto-pay. There&#x27;s another upgrade.<p>The police of today are most certainly better equipped, better prepared, better trained, respond quicker and there are more of them. I don&#x27;t agree with all of that but it&#x27;s what the voters want. All that costs money, and it&#x27;s most definitely different today than a couple decades ago.<p>Are roads worse today? I feel like they&#x27;re not. At least not where I live (which is in Dallas proper where the average home is around 2,000sqft and $150K, so not some rich enclave). I feel like we spend too much money on roads in fact. The new 635 toll-road seems a terrible waste of money when we could have just had a DART (commuter train) run West/East along it (there are almost no West/East running lines in Dallas, which makes the public rail system not all that useful for many).<p>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I drove on a gravel road. Even the state parks are fully paved. That definitely wasn&#x27;t the case 30 years ago.<p>So sure, we pay more today than we did decades ago. Changing subscriber-base, voter priorities and deploying the exact tech you&#x27;re complaining doesn&#x27;t exist is a big part of it.<p>This feels like an argument of &quot;Government Bad! Business Good!&quot; at this point to be honest.<p>Like saying: &quot;Most utilities providers have not even been improving their back-end technologies, which would serve to reduce costs, or improve the service&#x27;s availability.&quot;<p>Where do you get that from? Anecdotally that seems far from the truth considering the payment options and Customer Service available to people these days.<p>So they&#x27;re not tearing up the roads every few years to upgrade the pipe. <i>That&#x27;s a good thing.</i> They are OTOH purchasing more efficient fleet vehicles. Even in gas loving TX it&#x27;s common for Municipal vehicles to run on LNG. My Dad as a TxDOT employee working on the Galveston ferry has been through a lot of training. I can personally guarantee you TxDOT is not the same agency or using the same tech they were 30 years ago.

But, how does one create and use virtualenvs for the projects on the VM? Without virtualenvs you are set to trample the exiting Ubuntu Python installation.<p>I looked all over SO and even a few YouTube videos. Not sure I found an answer to the most fundamental question:  Is it possible to have PyCharm activate and use remote virtualenvs?<p>Two thoughts:<p>1- I am looking at this the wrong way. PyCharm has nothing to do with this. I have to setup VirtualHost on the VM and create an environment for each app. PyCharm will just use what&#x27;s there.<p>If #1 is the answer, I am guessing one would then point the PyCharm interpreter setting to /path/to/project/directory/bin/python rather than the system python.<p>2- I am missing something fundamental in my understanding of how this works and someone is going to come back with a one-liner that makes me go &quot;should have thought of that!&quot;.<p>Objectives:<p><pre><code>  - Use PyCharm under Windows\n  - Production code runs on Linodes\n  - Development VM runs Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS\n  - It doesn&#x27;t have to be a VM or even use Vagrant\n      - We can build an Ubuntu box and put it on the network\n      - We can also get a small Linode for development\n      - The point is to develop on Linux from Windows remotely\n  - Use virtualenvs to isolate project dependencies from Ubuntu&#x27;s Python installation\n      - each project has it&#x27;s own needs\n  - Saying &quot;just develop on Linux&quot; doesn&#x27;t solve the problem because if we were clear across the world with a Mac laptop we&#x27;d have the same problem we have on our Windows desktops. We need to develop on a remote Linux machine with different virtualenvs per project.\n</code></pre>\nA stopgap could be to build an Ubuntu Workskation VM, install PyCharm for Linux and develop within a portable VM.

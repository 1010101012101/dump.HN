9854877,comment,9851293,9854677,0,0,asyncwords,,,"Again, this is all subjective, but I&#x27;ll try to explain why I prefer live tiles over Android&#x27;s widgets.<p>1. Android widgets are huge, I can fit maybe 4-5 widgets on one page of the Android desktop. More than that, they become so scrunched that you can&#x27;t get any information out of them. This is compounded by the fact that some widgets only allow a certain size unless you download 3rd-party launchers.<p>2. Widget design is largely up to the app developer, and a lot of widgets are ugly (subjective) or at least don&#x27;t match the other widgets you have them grouped with.<p>3. Widgets try to be interactive, and I can&#x27;t tell you how frustrated it makes me when I&#x27;m scrolling across the desktops to look at widgets and I accidentally cross an item off of a todo list, or scroll through my list of emails instead of continuing on to the next desktop.<p>To me, the Android (and iPhone) home screens feel lifeless and dead when compared to a Windows Phone. On WP, my live tiles are always flipping around and displaying the latest emails, tweets, facebook posts, news articles, pictures from my camera roll, etc. The Windows Phone start screen displays all of that information to me at a glance, and I can pick and choose what to do next based on the summary that I see on my start screen. On Android, though, I have to actively search for that information by going from app to app.",1436392668

9854875,comment,9854160,9854632,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"Let&#x27;s say a video maker did create a Facebook page, and loaded all their videos onto it. That does not solve the problem, because Facebook is not an open, search-based system the way YouTube is. Facebook users will only see it in their NewsFeed if it is posted by a page they are following, or engaged with by a friend.<p>YouTube has a system to recognize copies of known videos, so they can prioritize the original video when they serve search results, or recommended videos. This allows them to soak up the demand for a particular video, and direct it at the appropriate copy (the one uploaded by the video&#x27;s creator).<p>Until Facebook has a similar system, multiple copies of a single video can exist within Facebook and potentially never cross paths, since propagation depends on the local shape of the social graph, and how EdgeRank moves content through it.<p>That means that even if a video creator uploads their own video to Facebook, they can&#x27;t soak up all the demand for it.<p>As the guy in the article says, the only way for him to become aware of a copy is if it lands in the NewsFeed of one of his fans. Whereas on YouTube, anyone can search for any title, and Content ID also finds matches.<p>edit: additions and clarity",1436392645

9854857,comment,9854160,9854160,0,0,austenallred,,,"This is absolutely rampant in the blackhat marketing world, (where I used to dabble, but still stay up on mostly out of curiosity).<p>The model goes like this: Watch a few different pages and try to identify something that&#x27;s bubbling up - that can be different viral facebook pages, reddit, whatever... there are a few different ways, but basically you constantly ping and scrape and try to identify stuff that&#x27;s going viral as early as possible.<p>Once you&#x27;ve done that, you have an automated script that downloads the video and uploads it to your Facebook page or scrapes the content and throws it on your wordpress site with a <i>really</i> weak &quot;link back&quot; to the original content. You build up a Facebook page that has a few million likes, cover your wordpress pages in ads, and profit. It&#x27;s not incredibly difficult to create an automated-if-unethical Buzzfeed.<p>It&#x27;s incredible to watch one viral post or video spread throughout the web. It spreads out on different sites and platforms as quickly as it spreads on social media. Few end users really care what the original source was (especially since it&#x27;s usually click-baity BS anyway), and the winners are the ones who can find the content the quickest and have the biggest reach.<p>I talked to a guy a couple of days ago who is making $60,000/month using this exact process, and has very little programming ability. He is, however, an absolutely shrewd and ruthless marketer with no ethical qualms about much of anything.<p>The content producers send him DMCA requests on occasion, and when that happens he or Facebook takes it down. But that&#x27;s just a cost of doing business, and 95% of the content stolen never sees a DMCA request, so who cares? (Assuming you have no ethical compass). Content creators aren&#x27;t constantly searching and scraping and trying to find other places where their content is hosted. That&#x27;s hard enough to do on one platform alone (i.e. YouTube), let alone monitoring other platforms (Facebook) and a bunch of wordpress sites.<p>It&#x27;s a game of content creators vs. &quot;marketers.&quot;<p>It gets even more difficult for the content creators as the &quot;marketers&quot; get smarter - heighten the pitch of a video a little bit so sound matching software can&#x27;t find it, reverse the video and choose different thumbnails so reverse image/video searches don&#x27;t find it, spin the text content (visitors aren&#x27;t really there for the great writing anyway), and you beat the vast majority of software. It&#x27;s up to the individual content creators to play the same game Google is playing to kill the spammers, which is not their core competency. Unless Facebook does something on its own platform, this won&#x27;t change. And even if they do, the best spammers will continue to outsmart the system.<p>The only way Facebook (and the content creators) win is if it becomes a core competency, much the same way defeating spam is for Google. I still know guys who can beat Google, but the level of sophistication is high enough that 99% of people can&#x27;t keep up.<p>There are a few simple ways you can beat the vast majority of the content theft though; if anyone is interested feel free to email me and I&#x27;ll point out some of the breadcrumbs the marketers leave behind.",1436392449

The system was a few years ahead of its time, as LED emitters were not yet powerful enough to replace her high-pressure sodium lamps, but it worked well for getting her new clones started. Beyond the simple efficiency of LEDs as light producers, the fact that we didn&#x27;t have to waste any power generating yellow-green light meant the power requirement was something like 10% of what it had been with HPS. Clorophyll absorption peaks are at 430nm and 662nm, so we used LEDs with peak wavelengths near those values, and while the light appeared dim and purple to human eyes, the plants loved it.",1436392127

In fact, the iterations in GraphX are quite long and hardly use the network at all, so we&#x27;re not sure if there&#x27;s much fine-grained synchronization going on.<p>That said, leaving the implementation details aside, latency is definitely a big deal, but 10G does help there, too: the latency for sending a fixed-size message can be a lot lower on an idle 10G network than on an idle 1G network. If we&#x27;re talking about very small synchronization messages, then maybe there isn&#x27;t much of a gain (network stack overhead dominates), but techniques like our destination-oriented edge processing help reduce the need for very fine-grained synchronization (for this computation at least). The only barrier-synchronization necessary in our fast 10G implementation is at the point at which no more updates are to be sent by <i>any</i> worker (this only happens once per iteration).<p>You&#x27;re quite right, however, that a lot of the work on network scheduling for big data computations mentioned in the NSDI paper operates at the coarse-grained level of some kind of &#x27;flow&#x27; notion. This would indeed be very hard to disambiguate in our implementation (part 2 will show this in more detail); I&#x27;m not convinced that these algorithms would help timely dataflow at all.",1436392124

I&#x27;m not sure why that isn&#x27;t a feasible option for educational use; instead of issuing a naked Pi, or a Pi and an Arduino, just issue a Pi+breadboard pair, already connected together.<p>If you&#x27;re especially worried about mishaps, and don&#x27;t mind modifying hardware in ways that aren&#x27;t easily reversible, you could even use adhesive to permanently fix the IDC connectors in place.<p>If, conversely, you don&#x27;t want to permanently connect all the parts to one another, you could also clip J8 pins 2 and 4 (5VDC) and 39 (one of several ground pins), and key the Pi-side IDC connector by stuffing the matching holes with a dab of quick-set epoxy. That by itself will suffice to protect against inadvertent 5V -> GPIO shorts; if you further use a breakout cable with keyed IDC connectors (e.g. [1]), and a breadboard breakout with a shrouded, keyed header (like an old-style IDE connector), then you end up with an entirely safe system.<p>And, taking that last idea further, you can get the same safety benefits at minimum hardware modifications (and no irreversible mods to the Pi) if you use:<p>- a ribbon with keyed connectors;<p>- a breakout with a keyed, shrouded header, and pins 2 and 4 removed;<p>- and a keyed shroud, such as [2] with the shipped pins removed, press-fitted to the Pi&#x27;s J8 header.<p>On the one hand, the keyed shrouds prevent fumble fingers from inadvertently misplugging the IDC connectors on either side; on the other, the absence of pins 2 and 4 on the breakout prevents inadvertent overvolting of GPIO pins.<p>(And all you need is a bit of protoboard and some solder to make the breakout, using the pins removed from [2] as the breadboard-side pins of the breakout. In fact, if you have students old enough to be trusted with soldering irons, this is not only parsimonious of materials but an excellent teaching opportunity in its own right!)<p>Granted, none of these solutions is entirely ideal. The point isn&#x27;t to provide a one-size-fits-all; instead, I&#x27;m trying to demonstrate that there are plenty of ways to solve this problem, many of which are less expensive and more user-transparent than pairing an Arduino with each Pi.<p>[1] <a href=""http://amzn.to/1foCXLy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/1foCXLy</a>

9854669,comment,9851703,9851703,0,0,Animats,,,"The UNIX file system abstraction is very simple, and doesn&#x27;t define post-crash states.  I once proposed different guarantees for different types of files:<p>- Unit files - the unit of update is the file. Files are created, written, and closed, and are not visible to other processes until closed.  Once closed, the file is read-only; it cannot be rewritten, only replaced as a unit.  For POSIX-type systems, files created with &#x27;creat&#x27; should be created in this mode.  O_TRUNC should be interpreted as &quot;replace the old file with the new version on close&quot;. If the program aborts before a proper close, the new file should be dropped, leaving the old version intact.<p>The crash guarantee should be that post-crash, you have a completely written file. It can be either the old version or the new version, but never a partial version. This eliminates the gyrations people go through to get this behavior.<p>- Log files - the unit of update is the write, which must be at the end. These are files opened for append.  Appending is always at the end of the file, even from multiple processes.  &quot;seek&quot; is disallowed if the file is open for writing; you can only append.<p>The crash guarantee should be that post-crash, you have a file which is either complete to the last write, or truncated precisely after some write. The file may not be cut in the middle of a record or trail off into junk.<p>- Temporary files - after a crash, they&#x27;re gone.<p>- Managed files - these are for databases, and support additional functions related to locking and file synchronization.  That&#x27;s what the article is about.  For the other types of files, you don&#x27;t need all those features.<p>In practice, most files are unit files, log files, or temporary files.  The number of programs which use managed files is small; mostly they&#x27;re database program or libraries.<p>Programs which use managed files and need data soundness after a crash must be very aware of concurrency and safety semantics. A somewhat different API may be required.  There should be two notifications from a write - &quot;data accepted&quot; and &quot;data safely committed&quot;.  Callers should be able to make blocking writes based on either of those, or make non-blocking writes and get two callbacks. This puts the concurrency management in the database application, which knows what data depends on other data. The file system can&#x27;t know that, and shouldn&#x27;t try to.",1436390374

I go into more detail here [1] on various models of source sharing and security review implications (my focus).<p>So, he could patent any key technology, publish the implementation with copyright protection, give source/binaries to customers on condition they keep paying, let users extend it for internal use, and even let users submit such improvements for others to use.. His company continues to make money on the licensing in each of these cases. All of this has been done before.

NIMBY-ism in Bay Area communities tends to be opposed increased density of any sort, but for the most part in NYC it&#x27;s focused more on the boundaries of low income housing areas.<p>East coast municipalities also have a lot more power to make mandates without the kind of broad community consensus that California cities have to abide by. So while residents can express opposition to a development plan and sometimes fight it in NYC, NIMBY advocates only carry weight when they&#x27;re well equipped to battle city hall.<p>Basically my point is that it&#x27;s kind of a stretch to draw a conclusion that the same patterns are applicable to both housing markets. The New York metro and the Bay Area metro are very different places with very different policies and political landscapes. New York&#x27;s inflated housing market has more to do with legacy policies from the Bloomberg administration and real estate speculation than too few units and NIMBY attitudes, which are a much bigger problem in SF",1436389958

It&#x27;s horrible value for multiple employees to linearly increase the total paid when they use Photoshop or Illustrator occasionally.",1436389503

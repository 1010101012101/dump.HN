245055,comment,244589,244589,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"<i>We can train technical skills, but we can't train honesty and candor.</i><p>I read something from someone sometime that said something like, ""I like to ask questions about the obscure items on their resume and ask them to explain the concepts."" The purpose was to see if the person will try to bullshit their way through it or will they throw up their hands and say, ""I don't know.""<p>The article's main point was, ""If they bullshit you during the interview, they'll bullshit that much more if you hire them.""",1215949791

The only thing stopping an ISV from growing is the popularity of the software...</i><p>Give me a break. If Intuit sells 10mm copies of QuickBooks a year, why don't they just have 5 or 6 employees instead of the hundreds that they have (that work on the QB side)?<p>Your ""Build a better mousetrap and the users will come"" approach just apply to every scenario. Maybe to yours, but not to everyone's.",1215949247

Religion provides discipline for those who have no self-discipline.<p>I don't see why so many on this thread need to convince themselves that religion never helps people. It does. I've seen it. Does it help everyone? Probably not. Is it a net positive for society as a whole? I don't think so. However, it clearly and surely helps some people some of the time.<p>I don't have any numbers, just personal anecdotes, but I've sure seen people saved by religion who would otherwise probably be dead, and I'm a hardcore atheist radical.",1215948751

I wasn't aware that it was official.<p>For what it's worth, I'm a taxpayer too, and I support giving kids responsibility for their own lives and teaching them to make decisions for themselves. But then again, most people consider me a crazy whacko radical who's not worth listening too. Opinions such as ""kids should learn responsibility"" tend to get one shunned from polite company nowadays.<p>My parents are also taxpayers, and I'm pretty sure they didn't care if I drank Coke or not. In fact, the abusive bastards even bought me a soda and an ice cream every now and then. Gasp!",1215948101

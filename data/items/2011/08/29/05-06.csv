2936132,comment,2935944,2935944,3,0,drhouse_md,,,"This article seems to be addressing 'the spirit' of a document or system.<p>Perhaps another way to look at the problem is to imagine creating an A.I. that you want to succeed at whatever system you present.  In most cases, an A.I. will take the literal interpretation of the system and become a test-taker, an electable 'gotcha-game' politician or even an entity that finds it can maximize game theory to its own ends by complicating the rules of an existing system to the point of absurdity once it becomes powerful enough to modify and create rules.<p>So then how do we create systems resistant to beings that take everything literally?  I suppose the only way is to reward certain outcomes as opposed to rewarding the direct product of the system itself.<p>Examples:  After an election, have we elected someone who has met with a high degree of favorability in the electorate by the end of his term?<p>After having students become proficient test-takers, do they then become excellent doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc.. ?<p>In a game invented to be fun or fair, once overlearned, do they produce fun or fairness?<p>If not, then a new game needs to be created or the existing one might need to be extensively modified to produced the desired product.  This is where the internet shines, where everyone is welcome to take an existing system and modify it to something better.  The problem with politics, law, stock market, etc... is that they have become the only method adopted in real society (there is only one game in town).<p>If reality were allowed to adopt, incorporate or evolve from systems/games from virtual reality (i.e. internet) there might be some productive change. But first we would need to see the first step taking place, that being even flawed virtual systems are allowed to manifest in significant proportion within real life society.<p>Don't hate the game, hate the player.

Some of them will tell you that explicitly even before dying.<p>So it's not really <i>disappointment</i>.  It's <i>advocacy</i>: there is a better way, a brighter future.

Recovering from a stall is simple; it's something you'll do very early in flight training (well before your first solo flight).<p>Planes crash when a lot of things go wrong at once.  In the case of the Colgan Air crash, the problem was not the stall.  The problem was that the pilots were sleepy, confused, and under-trained.  The stall was too much for them because they were in a state where they could panic, and they didn't have the training to stop panicing and start flying the plane.  So they randomly poked the controls, and that didn't save the plane.<p>Take two training pilots on a full 8 hour's sleep, and the stall probably wouldn't have even happened.  If it did, a ""whoa"" would have been exchanged and they might have gone around for another landing approach.  But I don't think it would be a big deal, it's just some randomness that is par for the course when you are trying to float twenty tons of metal through the air.",1314594257

In Safari you can just use Return to accept the first suggestion.<p>I HATE when return picks the first item from a match-list. How the hell do I just type what I want to type?",1207413121

Since I'm working 25% as much as you I'd expect 25% the equity that you have.  So if its you and a partner with 50% stakes working 40 hrs each ontop of my 10 hrs then I'd expect 9% of the company because that's how much of the effort I'm contributing.",1207412845

My first cut swung too much the other way, so I revised it -- apparently a bit too far.<p>I <i>like</i> those folks.

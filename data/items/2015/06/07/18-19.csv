If the seller doesn&#x27;t want you to &quot;buy&quot; something (e.g. privacy) then they can set the price arbitrarily high so that you won&#x27;t.<p>> I think you have rather casually tossed out the proposition that the status quo brings the customer negative value, without supplying any justification for that claim.<p>Why do you imagine the merchant is offering the &quot;discount&quot; if it isn&#x27;t net profitable? When the merchant makes money by exploiting the data they collect, whose pocket does that money come out of?<p>> I also think that your proposal of passing legislation to force all merchants to raise their lowest prices is unlikely to prove popular.<p>I don&#x27;t recall proposing that merchants be required to raise their prices, only that the prices they charge be the same regardless of whether customers use loyalty cards.",1433703598

Yes there&#x27;s a current fashion to call companies that are basically small businesses &quot;startups&quot;, but the term encompasses a far more profound class of enterprise.<p>And Apple itself was founded by an engineer (Woz) who first got his start at a big company, HP, which is celebrated as a hardware startup that grew.<p>I think the article and your comment do get to an important point, which is that Apple is big enough to have solid (and at the moment very successful) processes and infrastructure so that you only get experience in that matrix, and don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to spend any time learning stuff outside your own area.

It&#x27;s almost always best to choose a approach quickly rather than spend weeks and weeks evaluating. Secondly, choosing a cutting edge technology or really anything you&#x27;re unfamiliar with is a major risk that your timeline probably can&#x27;t absorb. I don&#x27;t have all the answers.

While it may be difficult it is possible.<p>From the horses mouth:<p>Discharge in Bankruptcy\nThis is not an automatic process—you must prove to the bankruptcy court that repaying your student loan would cause undue hardship.<p>If you file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may have your loan discharged in bankruptcy only if the bankruptcy court finds that repayment would impose undue hardship on you and your dependents. This must be decided in an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court. Your creditors may be present to challenge the request. The court uses this three-part test to determine hardship:<p>If you are forced to repay the loan, you would not be able to maintain a minimal standard of living.\nThere is evidence that this hardship will continue for a significant portion of the loan repayment period.\nYou made good-faith efforts to repay the loan before filing bankruptcy (usually this means you have been in repayment for a minimum of five years).\nYour loan will not be discharged if you are unable to satisfy any one of the three requirements. If your loan is discharged, you will not have to repay any portion of your loan, and all collection activity will stop.

It supports master-slave replication. It can persist to disk either by periodically flushing the current state or by writing a log of all commands. It can handle very large numbers of open connections. It&#x27;s extremely fast, and widely used.

9675909,comment,9673390,9675710,0,0,davnicwil,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting point, replacing a lost key is always going to be the weak point in any security scheme, unless you intentionally make the process hard/cumbersome enough that it isn&#x27;t, but makes losing the key a very unpleasant, costly event both for the user, and the service you&#x27;re trying to access.<p>Why would businesses like Facebook implement such a scheme? As you predict it would probably end up in them losing a lot of customers when keys are lost.<p>I think any business, even where security is critical, would worry about this too. I.e. &#x27;what, my bank makes me call up their customer service, wait on hold, speak to 8 different individuals, then wait three days for processing, if I lose my key? No thanks, remembering a strong password seems an easier alternative - I&#x27;ll just go to a competitor that allows that&#x27;.<p>That&#x27;s not even to mention wrapping up the scheme in an easy-to-use way for non-technical users. It&#x27;d be fine until the point it isn&#x27;t, at which point the customer service / PR fallout cost of things going wrong is very high. Everyone understands passwords.<p>I think there are enough problems here that such a scheme would likely not have enough adoption to become mainstream.<p>But I think more importantly, isn&#x27;t the fact that your key(s) would have to be tied to a physical client the true deal-breaker? A website that you can only access from a certain set of physically secured devices with the correct keys installed throws away perhaps the biggest advantage of the web.",1433703234

Even 10,000 was too much for me at that age.<p>Computer science is about being smart and understanding things.  Software engineering is about realizing how dumb you are compared to the task, and developing strategies to control that complexity and manage your time.<p>The best programmers I&#x27;ve seen have these qualities:<p>1) They have simply exercised their brains enough to wrap their heads around 50,000+ lines of code.  They know how to read code.<p>2) On top of that, they know how structure their code to avoid having to understand all of it line by line.  They write their code to facilitate &quot;chunking&quot;&#x27;, the same skill that a chess player uses to assess a board position quickly.<p>3) They trade off time vs quality by sweating the details WHEN IT MATTERS.  For core parts of the program, it absolutely pays off to do original research.  For example, writing data structures for search algorithms or graphics engines.<p>But the data structures are less than 10% of the code in an information retrieval system; the graphics engine is is probably 10% of the code in a real game.<p>For the rest of the system, you need to plow through it quickly, perhaps copying and pasting code from older systems.<p>Usually you have different developers working on these parts -- some people are good at plowing through tasks;  some people are good at working on well crafted code solving a difficult problem.  But the latter are usually experienced developers in their 30&#x27;s, not fresh grads at 22.  At 22 you&#x27;ll be tasked with plowing through code.<p>After 13 years of professional programming, I think that &quot;taste&quot; is basically learning what matters.  Lots of things I obsessed over when I was 22 didn&#x27;t end up mattering.  When you can only work on 1,000 lines of code at a time, you&#x27;re simply missing the big picture.

For example, the set of real numbers are infinite sequences of rational numbers (fractions) which approximate the value. But the equality which we place on this set is not the equality of sequences, which is too strict. We put a new equality on these real numbers which identify two of them iff they come arbitrarily close to each other.<p>The axiom of choice (AC) says that if for a ∈ A there is b ∈ B satisfying some requirement, then there is a function A → B selecting these elements. The axiom of choice is only problematic if we require that choice function it produces respects some quotient equality we placed on A and B.

If you are smart (and have the cash), a 83(b) election can be hugely beneficial for your taxes... unless the price at which you do the election is far above the eventual market price of the stock, in which case you are out quite a bit of money.<p>Edit: If the company truly feels that their stock can be substituted for salary, then it shouldn&#x27;t have more than a 12-month cliff for vesting.",1433701231

(after mainly doing trivialities before)<p>So far the learning experience was great, and generally the best about learning new things for me isn&#x27;t so much when I get something finished (the last steps often become a tedious chore). Rather I most enjoy working on a (for me, at this point) hard problem and finally get the flash of understanding when a initially misunderstood error or bug can be explained... Luckily the world of programmable logic seems to have no shortage of hard to comprehend things 😁.<p>But I think that should be everyone&#x27;s motivation to learn new things, right?",1433700415

9675694,comment,9673912,9675340,0,0,susam,,,"I am sorry to know that you feel left out. QWERTZ keyboard is not too different from QWERTY keyboard. QWERTZ keyboard has the positions of Y nd Z are interchanged and has a few more letters with diaeresis. So I believe you might be able to use QuickQWERTY itself on QWERTZ keyboard as well if you are a little careful about ignoring the guide for units 7 and 12.<p>By the way, the code for QuickQWERTY is available at at <a href=""https://github.com/susam/quickqwerty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/susam/quickqwerty</a>. Anyone interested in writing units for alternate keyboard layouts like QWERTZ, AZERTY, Dvorak, etc. just needs to fork the project and work with one file: js/units.js. All the units are defined in this single JavaScript file.<p>The only things that one might find a little confusing in js/units.js are the &#x27;main&#x27; and &#x27;alternate&#x27; properties. The &#x27;main&#x27; units teach 6-7 split style of typing the number keys and the &#x27;alternate&#x27; units override some &#x27;main&#x27; units (units 16 to 20) to teach 5-6 split style. For more information on this, see <a href=""http://quickqwerty.com/README.html#split"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickqwerty.com/README.html#split</a>.<p>So all one needs to do to support alternate keyboard layouts is to edit js/units.js and define lessons that make sense for the keyboard layout. The user interface is not hardcoded to display only 21 units and only 5 subunits per unit. Therefore, one can change the number of units in js/units.js as well as the number of subunits in any unit, and the user interface should take care of displaying the appropriate number of units and subunits.",1433700396

Apps that fall into this category are things like distance measurement, to-do lists, etc.<p>2) App that has viral potential but lots of competition: freemium (games fall into this category)<p>3) Niche app that solves a hard problem for a small number of users: paid, with the price as high as possible.<p>There is a fourth category, but it&#x27;s illusory: app that solves a hard prolbem for many users and has viral potential.

However, the reality that I&#x27;ve experienced is that the developers most willing to guess about how code works, copy and paste googled code, and push others to feed them answers instead of doing research on their own are considered to be the top developers because they &#x27;get things done&#x27;.

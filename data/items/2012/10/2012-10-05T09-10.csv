It's just that in our field seniority doesn't give you such an enormous advantage as in other fields.  In many professions, if you are 40+ you will expect a multiple of the salary that an equally competent 25 years old gets.  Software engineering is more of a meritocracy, you may get paid a lot even at a young age if you're good, and it won't get much better with age unless your skills also get better (and in practice, contrary to what all of us like to believe, it's hard to get significantly better over time.)<p>The contrast with other professions is so great that this age-blindness seems like age-based discrimination, kind of like a 80 degrees pool seems cold if you've just jumped out of a hot tub.",1349430844

The more interesting problem is what ELSE you've traded off to eliminate I/O on the common path - and in many languages it turns out to be memory fragmentation and/or garbage collection time. In Java, stop-the-world GC pauses of multiple seconds are not unheard of, and it's no fun being Oracle's test bed for undocumented GC features.

4616176,comment,4615602,4615794,22,0,StavrosK,,,"I was at the University College London three years ago, studying machine learning, and a researcher gave us a presentation about a new machine learning technique she was trying (it was applying SVMs to, err, I forget the medical imaging technique. Maybe EKGs). It turned out that she could reliably predict depression in a significant percentage of patients, and severe depression in 100% of patient, or some other similar, extremely high, percentage.<p>This blew me away, but I only now realized why. It was because I knew depression was symptomatically defined, and she had probably found a way to define it physically. I thought that the ""lesser"" cases she couldn't detect weren't actually physically depressed, and that her discovery was amazing. Other students didn't share my enthusiasm, but maybe that was because it wasn't very interesting from a machine learning perspective.<p>I wonder what happened with that. I can't remember her name now.<p>EDIT: I found the paper: <a href=""http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1316862/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1316862/</a>",1349428687

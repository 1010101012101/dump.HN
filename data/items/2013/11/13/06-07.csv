It has been possible to print with metal clay for a very long time, with every paste extrusion setup made so far, the major problem is material cost and firing. I don&#x27;t expect an object made with metal clay to handle 5000psi in compression, but it might be possible with some clever geometry. The major issue with metal clay is that is behaves like clay in many ways, severely limiting geometry that can be fired without breaking. You can think of it as very high viscosity solder paste.",1384325940

That&#x27;s a big deal, because it helps the database choose the right algorithms as your data changes. Continuing gracefully while the input data is changing sounds like scalability to me.<p>* Postgres is generally considered to scale to many concurrent connections and many cores. Useful for OLTP.<p>* Sometimes the right feature or extensibility hook can make a huge difference allowing you to do the work in the right place at the right time. For instance, LISTEN/NOTIFY makes it easier to build a caching layer that&#x27;s properly invalidated -- not trivial to get right if the feature is missing, which might mean that you&#x27;re not getting as much out of caching as you could be.<p>Tuning for SSDs, compression, buffer caching, etc., are the antithesis of scalability. Those things are pure performance issues. Scalability is about a system that adapts as input data and processing resources change. (Your point about replication does concern scalability, of course.)",1384324918

Backstabbing somebody else does not change your worth, it just makes them less valuable than you. So your salary does not change, theirs just goes down.<p>Far more importantly, I have spent my 25 year career in non-stack ranked companies, and I have never seen the behavior you describe. Yet just about everyone at stack ranked companies report back stabbing behavior. I think empiricism wins over speculation.",1384322869

Absolutely no excuses there, since supporting PHP 4.4 is not a valid excuse.

(I don&#x27;t necessarily believe this; I don&#x27;t know what I believe, but this is the other side of the debate).<p>The prolonged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan happened despite the repercussions for lost sons and daughters. We&#x27;re losing people right now, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis lost their lives because we didn&#x27;t have enough manpower (or weren&#x27;t willing to take the risk) to enforce order. If we could spin up machines the way we spin up dynos, these problems would go away. No American soldiers would die. We&#x27;d spin up production and deployment to enforce near <i>total</i> order. We could reduce Iraqi deaths by orders of magnitude. The machines don&#x27;t necessarily have to act like terminators. They could act like military police too.<p>This might be a scary future, no doubt. But it might be a bright one too. If we trust our values and trust that our elected representatives won&#x27;t go on mindless killing sprees, the machines might be a blessing in disguise. (Also note that by the time we get machines with this capability, our government, social structure, our entire economic model, and our appreciation for civil liberties will evolve quite far from where it is now too).",1384322690

The really interesting point of the &quot;How NOT to build a Terminator&quot; talk was not just that we had to avoid building evil machines, but that we have the potential to build machines with <i>better</i> ethics than human soldiers. Avoid atrocities committed to angry soldiers, avoid accidental wars started by twitchy trigger fingers, avoid intentional wars started by people who weren&#x27;t authorized to start those wars, that kind of thing.

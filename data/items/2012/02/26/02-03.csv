3634639,comment,3634018,3634553,3,0,ikirill,,,"I agree. In general, I find the task of ""introduce yourself to a specific person"" or ""make a specific case for something"" much much easier than ""talk to people about nothing in particular"", if only because there is always a specific goal that I keep in mind while talking. So long as I deliver a presentation well and impart all the main ideas, it's going well. I find that small talk is impossible to handle like that because it's too random and there is no specific easy-to-see criterion of success or failure. Others simply paying attention could indeed mean politeness rather than interest.<p>Staying quiet, I feel, has the unfortunate side effect of making me seem asocial, and I am not quite sure that it is a viable thing to do in a social situation.",1330225037

3634637,comment,3634078,3634078,5,0,evanlong,,,"My Google interview experience:<p>Google Internship January 2008: Had a phone screen. First question as I heard it: Given a binary tree tell me if it is a binary tree? I was a bit confused and said I didnt understand the question and requirements. Given A tell me if its A. Yes? The interviewers response to my confusion was: Do you even know what a binary tree is? Yes, I do. When he restated the question as given a binary tree tell me if its a <i>valid</i> binary search tree I understood the requirements efffed up something in the implementation though. Then was asked to do another problem. Something with number sequence and iteration. Got told division is slow so dont use it. Couldnt see a solution without division on the spot. Then got asked if I know about Java serialization. My response: implements Serializable and you can write out or read in objects but I have never really used it in any serious way before.<p>I got the reject. Which I expected more or less. Kind of frustrating since I felt the interview was pretty much done in the first few minutes since I was asked: do you even know what a binary tree is. Kind of an uphill battle from my perspective.<p>YouTube February 2010:\nApplied for YouTube because I saw an ad in gmail. Why not.<p>2 phone interviews. And 4 onsite.<p>I thought I did ok solved everything to the best of my ability. Frustrated that I didnt get it. Really enjoyed it. Seemed like a lot of fun. One interviewer told me my current job sounded boring. Not at all professional.<p>Google Kirkland June 2010:\nI applied for a developer position after I saw a Google Kirkland is hiring ad. Applied for Software Engineering role and said Id like to work on Google Chrome.<p>Eventually a recruiter got back to me and would set me up with a phone call. Yep, I thought it was the initial HR phone screen for a software development role. The HR phone screen was rescheduled and I was told that in the mean time they would be happy to set me up for a call with an engineer for a <i>test position</i>. So the things got pushed off a few days. I still ended up talking with an HR rep before the engineer. She seemed a bit surprised that I had just interviewed at YouTube a few months before. All I thought was wow your HR software sucks. So I jumped through the HR phone screen and technical phone screen.<p>The onsite in Kirkland was interviews with two developers and two testers. Standard interview technical interview questions. First one was count number of bits in a 32 bit integer. I sent straight for the mask. Add the bytes in parallel. Then add the 4 bytes together. Interviewer was shocked I got that so quick. Ya, crazy when you have been asked the same question in the past, in school... you tend to memorize it from practice. The other interesting thing from the interview was the interviewer worked on the video tag of Chrome. Said the hard stuff was video and audio synchronization and doing that right across 3 different platforms. When I was at YouTube they said they used H264 because it was a good codec for quality and bandwidth and didnt foresee themselves switching anytime soon. When I asked the Chrome guy if the company was willing to align on not h264 would it happen. The response: oh yeah we are on the same page. Yeah, and then shortly after my interview this was posted: <a href=""http://apiblog.youtube.com/2010/06/flash-and-html5-tag.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apiblog.youtube.com/2010/06/flash-and-html5-tag.html</a>. Oh yes Google, you are a BIG company. Admit it!<p>The last interview of the day I remember slugging through and just not doing well on. Yeah, didnt get the job.<p>My recommendation to Google:\nPhone interviews and Google Docs dont mix. There is no auto-indent (that I know of) and I have mentioned that during an interview and got a yeah I know type of response. I would recommend: <a href=""http://collabedit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collabedit.com/</a> or something Google owns: <a href=""http://etherpad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://etherpad.com/</a>.<p>Books have been written and sometimes speak of the problems Google faces. In my opinion the biggest problem: hubris. I say that from my own experience as well as this book: <a href=""http://amzn.com/1594202354"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.com/1594202354</a>. They live in their own insulated bubble it seems.<p>Professionalism is important. Sentences with phrases do you even know or your job sounds boring are rude.<p>Your HR software seems to suck. I am not actually interested in a role in Test Engineering. Yet, whenever a Google recruiter digs my name up and emails that is the role it is for. \nMy recommendation to someone starting their career:\nNever ever ever take a job as a SDET/SET. It will hang over your head for years and hold back your career.<p>I used to really want to work at Google. After a few years in industry and these interviews I no longer have that interest isnt there any more. For me, it depends on the team and people Ill be working with more than the product or the company.

3634633,comment,3633256,3633416,3,0,pak,,,"I love pandoc too, and there are three things that would make me absolutely giddy if they were added:<p>1) Proper reference support.  In LaTeX you can use things like \ref{fig:foo} to insert autonumbers for things like Figure X and Table Y.  (Which is awesome, because if you move a figure, you don't have to change all of your numbers around.)  There's no Pandoc markdown equivalent, so this gets lost if I convert to e.g. HTML.  I have to work around this with a script that looks for this LaTeX snippet and does the counters before passing to Pandoc.<p>2) Better footnote output for LaTeX.  Right now, if you use a [^foo] footnote mark twice, you will get two \footnote{}'s in your LaTeX (and therefore a repeated footnote message in your output) instead of a \footnotemark for the second one.<p>3) Better metadata.  Both Jekyll and MMD are so much more flexible about the metadata you add at the top of a document; Pandoc seems to think the only items I'll ever need are author, title, and date.  If I could only add things like addresses, enclosures, salutation lines, and extra variables my templates could adjust to, I could produce more sensible templates for formats like business letters.",1330224909

3634630,comment,3629909,3632160,1,0,joemoon,,,"> both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand).<p>It's funny that your'e using this quote to prove your point, when it actually identifies the perfect example that you're looking for.<p>Image that we have a relatively ""dumb"" client that can only understand our media type and follow URLs to the next resource.  We already agree that this is useful when you have an intelligent actor (human), so let's move on to the part that your'e interested in: ""improved on-the-fly"".<p>Let's take our dumb client and add one feature: A Javascript engine. This gives us the ""code-on-demand"" that Fielding referenced.  You can now improve your dumb little client, by adding application logic that can be executed on-the-fly.  Your client can now be upgraded to understand new media types, or to change the behavior of interaction with existing media types.  And yes, this means the client can be upgraded even when there is no human interaction.<p>Want a real world example?\nI recently wrote a javascript application that automatically runs a set of comprehensive tests on HTTP requests (and their caching properties) and collects the data.  I was able to turn the dumb client into a smarter one (for my purposes).  It has a single entry point and programmatically follows many different kinds of links.   My tests run on approximately 1 billion clients, and I didn't have to update any client software to make that happen.  If I want to check the cache behavior of resources behind my business partner's proxy server, guess what: I can upgrade his client (his browser) on the fly to do the testing for me.<p>Want another real world example?\nWe used javascript in a webview (dumb client) on mobile platforms to create unit tests for some native functionality.  Our dumb client happens to have a bridge to the native code on the mobile device.  This allows us to write one set of unit tests in javscript and run it on multiple mobile platforms.  This is a great example that falls outside of the standard desktop web browser examples.<p>So let's take a look at your example.\n> In either scenario, the non-human client is just as hard-coded as the other--it's either jumping to external URLs or jumping to internal links.<p>We were smart enough to develop a dumb client that can execute code on demand. Now let's upgrade our client to validate the input fields _before_ POSTing back to the server. Bam, we just improved our client on-the-fly, without modifying the client software.<p>So you may be thinking:  But how useful is this to me? If I'm developing a new network-based business analysis tool for my company, it's probably not going to run on 1 billion clients.  Do I really need to consider hypermedia as engine state and on-the-fly updates?  Well no, of course not, that would be overkill.  As Fielding put it:<p>""REST is intended for long-lived network-based applications that span multiple organizations. If you dont see a need for the constraints, then dont use them.""",1330224834

Taught them to do something for others (the original intent).\n2. Taught them that going up to random people and speaking with them, or asking them for help, is okay and not that difficult (not expected).\n3. Taught them to communicate a mission statement with clarity, so people would understand why you are ringing their doorbell (not expected).\n4. Taught them that people are rather generous and appreciative when approached with good intentions (not expected).\n5. Taught them a little about planning.  We created a flyer that we could show people what was needed by the food pantry, we planned the process, from a few calls, to the entire ""life-cycle"" - and we went into action.\n6.

If you think it is, I'd be interested in seeing some supporting data.<p>Even if it were supported by these bodies though, I don't see how that would be enough to make the territories occupied in the sense quoted above. The position of international bodies is, regrettably, often driven more by interests than principle. Ninety years ago, for example, major international organisations (The League of Nations, European powers, the Ottoman Empire) supported Israel's (to be) claim to all British Mandate territories, which includes the West Bank. Agreements were signed [1], and ratified by the UN at its founding.<p>What I am saying is, that each side in this conflict has legitimate claims to the territory, and that both sides' claims are supported by past international resolutions and treaties, by a historical presence in the land, and perhaps most importantly, by an agreement between the sides themselves - the Oslo Accords.<p>No reasonable Israeli, including myself, is interested in prolonging Israeli rule over the Palestinian population. I even believe, as I think do most Israelis, that within a comprehensive solution to this conflict, it is in Israel's strategic interest to treat the West Bank as largely Palestinian territory, regardless of any claims and rights Israel might have to it.<p>Israel has, several times in the past, agreed to withdraw from most of the West Bank, most notably during the Camp David accords of 2000, and the succeeding peace plan put forward by Clinton (""The Clinton Parameters""), which were rejected by the Palestinians at the time. A comprehensive account of events is given by Dennis Ross in his book ""The Missing Peace"", which I can warmly recommend to any student of the conflict.<p>Israel's current military presence in most of the West Bank, is, as I see it, largely a security issue. After Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, a Palestinian civil war ensued that resulted in Hamas rule over Gaza. Hamas openly calls for Israel's destruction, and backs it up with routine rocket fire into Israeli population centers.<p>Israel is a liberal democracy, largely driven by western values of equality and prosperity. Our neighbors are, sadly, not. Along with most Israelis, I hope that a peaceful resolution to this conflict can be found, and take no issue to with eventual Palestinian control over nearly the entire West Bank and East Jerusalem.<p>PS.

3634550,comment,3634507,3634507,1,0,relaunched,,,"The content of this post isn't unique to BIG VCs.  Anytime you take money from someone that is capable of following-on, and they don't, it's a major bad signal.  However, on the flip side, a professional VC that comes in at A or later is going to know that any investor w/ a strategy that doesn't include following on, is gonna be biased in the other direction.<p>The bigger miss, from a post like this, is saying the problem is getting in bed with a BIG VC too early.  Take money where you can get it from, if you need it.  Most people will never be in a position to choose one firm's money over another.  And today's climate, most rounds are syndicated (this post is a few years old).  However, the risk / rewards of getting involved with any professional investor is they give you capital to accelerate growth, but will kill you if you fail to meet or exceed expectations.  Big VCs want to follow on and aren't looking to tank a successful company.  However, if you don't do your job, they won't normally throw good money after bad.<p>Investors only become a problem if the founder(s) don't do their job, which is to grow HUGE FAST!  If you do that, you won't have to worry about the aforementioned situation where a BIG VC failing to follow-on kills you in a future round.",1330222451

But LaYeX, strikingly beautiful though its output is, has not taken off outside computer science journal articles.<p>Two opposing points: (1) on reddit, I'll often check the markup result, going back and forth (esp checking URLs - probably less important for other writing), and that <i>seems</i> inefficient. I did the same with LaTeX; (2) when I read the text in the rendered format, I'll pick up different typos, perhaps because the line-spacing and font are different and so my eyes parse it differently (like that trick with ""of"" doubled at end and start of a line).<p>For a year, I used a homegrown markup language for uni notes.  It was fun to use, seemed helpful, but I think was primarily self-indulgent.\nMaybe I should try it again - I'm currently using either plaintext for documentation (which isn't really clear enough); or open office Word (which takes forever to startup, doesn't <i>feel</i> accessible (can't just cat or head or tail or more or less or grep it), has non-vi keybindings and generally is a pain (though I complement their job of copying MS Word).<p>Finally - I'm kinda surprised at markdown's success (and it really is successful). I would expect WYSIWYG to be more user-friendly.  I think one factor is that markup is optional in the context where it's been successful (like reddit). In other words, it may be ""successful"" because (1) it's not actually needed or used much (I mean, typos/grammos are endemic online, right?) (2) it has the gentlest possible learning curve if you do want to use it. Does this mean it would be terrible at more serious uses?  Or that it is ideal to disrupt incumbent formatting methods? (<i>disrupt</i> defined: ""initially worse at key features, but has features appealing to different users such as convenience/price/accessibility"").<p>It would be interesting to measure the percentage of reddit comments that actually use any markdown at all. I think it would be very low, something like 1-2%<p>BTW: You had my vote at ZX81 is that wrong?",1330221754

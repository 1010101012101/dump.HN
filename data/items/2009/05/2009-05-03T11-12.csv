But other gains (rented properties etc.) are not yet accounted for.<p>Belgium and Germany for example removes the taxes ""at the source"", which means that when you get your salary you don't have anything else to pay on it, your employer already sent the money to the State. I don't know how they do on other taxable revenues.",1241351943

590792,comment,590151,590151,0,0,siculars,,,"i actually worked in the special collection division of michigan state universitys library in the spring and summer of 1997. they were using a commercial device, whose name escapes me, that allowed the book to lay flat and be imaged from above. the software accounted for the curvature of the page for ocr purposes. judging from the posted pictures in the article, the google device seems more elaborate with stereo cameras in the infrared spectrum.<p>bottom line, though, is that people have been digitizing books for a long time before google came along. sure, google is doing it on a larger scale with more resources at their disposal but it is not new to the dozens and hundreds of academic libraries around the world.<p>a simple search for overhead book scanners returns a ton of links, including this one to wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_scanning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_scanning</a>.",1241351080
590791,comment,590643,590643,0,0,m_eiman,,,"I don't know how it is over the States, but at least here in Sweden it's only ""national"" ads that I ever see on the news papers' websites. I wonder if it's too hard, too expensive or not useful enough for local ads on the web. In the physical papers it's mainly local ads, so the need and market should be there.<p>Might be interesting to look into this more; if technology is the only problem there's definately money to be made.",1241351034
590790,comment,590460,590460,0,0,peterbraden,,,"Not to language flame, but I think that php has a longer learning curve in this respect. Because of the huge number of functions available, there's a lot to memorise.<p>Learning an API is the hardest part of any new technology because of all the rote work.<p>Contrast this with something like python/django or ruby/rails - sure there's a lot to learn in the frameworks, but the language themselves are fairly small.<p>This means glue code is really quick to write, and you only really have to look at the framework documentation.",1241350867

590788,comment,590460,590635,0,0,peterbraden,,,"this is _really_ good advice - I find when I'm coding in a coffee shop then I feel more productive because the internet is a really big distraction.<p>I have the documentation on my laptop as well as the framework source code, so whenever I need to look someting up it's there. Having to make an effort to look stuff up means that my brain has more of an incentive to memorise it.<p>And practise, practise, practise. These things come over time.",1241350650
590787,comment,590632,590632,0,0,andrewljohnson,,,"Not to discount the skills of Joel and Jeff, but one thing to keep in mind is it's much easier to build a social site for a bunch of hackers, than for example, a bunch of retirees.<p>The same thing goes for Hacker News. StackOverflow and HN are great, but when you look at their traffic figures, (1600 a day to start for HN, and 30k a day today) keep in mind that websites for computer programmers will just in general perform the best among any sort of website, in terms of market penetration.<p>What they don't perform very well in is having visitors who don't run adblock. Because of this quirk, you need to have a million-dollar revenue source like Spolsky has on his blog - a job board for programmers.",1241350313

590778,comment,589346,589376,0,0,ezy,,,"I disagree, I found it cliche'.  It's a good blog-post, but not really world changing.  Not to put you down -- I get caught up in these kinds of things too -- but what <i>real</i> evidence does he actually have to support his hypothesis?  Sure, I could say that it isn't true because of this and that, but how valid would <i>my</i> argument be?  ANgels on the head of a pin, and all that...<p>What he does is list a couple surprising facts, then invent scenarios to fit the evidence.  It's one of the most common rhetorical techniques on blogs and in pop-science speculative books, and whether the author means it or not -- it can turn intellectually dishonest very quickly without adding clear qualification in the text.<p>I don't find this sort of stuff convincing or useful anymore.  It's the same reason I have a natural distaste for Gladwell and his book-selling ilk -- this type of conjecture seems enlightening, and maybe you could get a few interesting ideas out of it.. but it's not supported.  And in the end, you end up with stuff that's an interesting thought-experiment, but leaves you none the wiser.",1241349556

590773,comment,590479,590703,0,0,dandelany,,,"We're splitting some major hairs here, but my point is that placing and misnaming this option, an <i>extremely common</i> task you'd want to accomplish in this pane, in a second-layer dialog, when a majority of the options are in the first layer, is unequivocally user-unfriendly. I would mock up a better solution, but Apple already has (see above). You're looking at this from a developer's perspective; to the average user, SMB may as well be secret code. And it has everything to do with excessive automation, mostly because it's hard for a novice to 'un-automate'.",1241348730

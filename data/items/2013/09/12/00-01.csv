Doing MVC-style architecture on the browser side works just fine. One of my long-term projects is a relatively large web application that uses something very close to the original MVC idea, with a central model that holds all the state and then a few dozen view-controller pairs that handle all the ways of interacting with it. This architecture has served me well for several years now, and the design has proven to be very easy to maintain and adapt to changing requirements. (In practice I add a fourth type of component in the web context, a store that is responsible for communicating with the server, and I define a small number of additional relationships to go with it because it doesnt fit into any of the other three categories. Even then, the store acts somewhat like a view-controller pair for most purposes, and the cases where it doesnt are mostly things I might do differently with the wisdom of hindsight.)<p><i>On the Web in the next 5-10 years maybe we will see more frameworks separating the concerns of the Web server/database and the client-side.</i><p>Im not sure why we need any distinction between them. Ultimately, were just writing a distributed application, which happens to run using something like HTTP as a communications protocol in this case. All the usual concepts about maintaining state and actions that have side effects apply, and all the usual arguments about separating such concerns apply. What makes you think we cant use these ideas already today?",1378947140
6371261,comment,6370723,6371136,10,0,Steko,,,"Here&#x27;s the article I was reminded of, and I&#x27;ve read variations on the same theme many times:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/opinion/04brass.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/opinion/04brass.html?pagew...</a><p><i>early in my tenure, our group of very clever graphics experts invented a way to display text on screen called ClearType...<p>Engineers in the Windows group falsely claimed it made the display go haywire when certain colors were used. The head of Office products said it was fuzzy and gave him headaches. The vice president for pocket devices was blunter: hed support ClearType and use it, but only if I transferred the program and the programmers to his control. As a result, even though it received much public praise, internal promotion and patents, a decade passed before a fully operational version of ClearType finally made it into Windows.</i><p><i>When we were building the tablet PC in 2001, the vice president in charge of Office at the time decided he didnt like the concept. The tablet required a stylus, and he much preferred keyboards to pens and thought our efforts doomed. To guarantee they were, he refused to modify the popular Office applications to work properly with the tablet. So if you wanted to enter a number into a spreadsheet or correct a word in an e-mail message, you had to write it in a special pop-up box, which then transferred the information to Office. Annoying, clumsy and slow.<p>So once again, even though our tablet had the enthusiastic support of top management and had cost hundreds of millions to develop, it was essentially allowed to be sabotaged. To this day, you still cant use Office directly on a Tablet PC. And despite the certainty that an Apple tablet was coming this year, the tablet group at Microsoft was eliminated.</i>",1378947138

I haven&#x27;t looked too closely at any of the images, and I don&#x27;t even have my glasses on :)  But my initial sense is that the powerful frontal speculars and weird foot contact in the first photo look totally bogus (beyond strong lens-axis flash bogus due to the feet); As he walks up the stairs from the subway, the illumination on his legs is the opposite of the lambertian falloff you might expect (furthermore, how can the sides of the stairwell illuminate his legs?), and the frontal diffuse light on him and speculars on the shield don&#x27;t fit with the illumination of the railings to me; on Puerto Rico day, you would expect the strong speculars on his shield to register similarly on the glasses and jewelry of the woman next to him (and also, the diffuse light on both appears to be falling from slightly different directions); Jumping out of FDNY truck, illumination again seems reversed, and though the left-hand door has a shadow, he doesn&#x27;t; Meditating in the park, possibly just really strong strobe.

Highly doubtful a photo would be high-res enough to get text-level detail but certainly the general layout and colors of whatever she was looking at would show up.  So if this led to a successful ID, she must have been looking at an app or page that is user-customizable to some extent like facebook with a unique profile and cover.  If you have even a blurry image of a website, the RGB colors are still going to be pretty close so if you have some sort of way of automatically iterating through user pages on the website in question (GraphAPI), doing direct page capture to image, scaling down that image, doing the appropriate rotation, shear, etc., and then running some simple image match criteria, that &quot;might&quot; work.  Facebook has billions of users though which surely would take more than 24 hours to iterate through, so maybe you could prune the search space by only searching friends of people claiming the high school graduation year in question.",1378947065

And, it is not like there are not explorations of cooking in non imperative forms.<p>When your metaphor is &quot;with these ingredients and devices, perform these transformations on them&quot; an imperative form works really well.  This is just as true for any algorithm you will want to write.  Consider, write down any algorithm for how to do something.  I challenge that key to your algorithm will be the idea of transforming something.  Often in a &quot;destructive&quot; way.<p>An example, with the concept of a browser that has state, the following algorithm will get you logged in to your bank.<p><pre><code>    browser = new browser\n    browser.location = &quot;www.yourbank.com&quot;\n    browser.focusFieldLabeled(&quot;username&quot;)\n    browser.type(&quot;your name&quot;)\n    browser.focusFieldLabeled(&quot;password&quot;)\n    browser.type(&quot;your password&quot;)\n    browser.focusButtonLabeled(&quot;login&quot;).or(&quot;submit&quot;)\n    browser.click()\n</code></pre>\nImplementing something that does this would be trivial, all things told.

Ok, maybe he is talking about some special implementation of events but there are a lot of GUI oriented MVC interpretations which use some special events/signals implementation without trying to put it in the name of the pattern/framework because events are a common part of GUI domain then it suggest a lack of experience.<p>Without the E in the MOVE we have just MOV.<p>Let&#x27;s talk about Operations now. There are several MVC frameworks which use different names for the classes related to controllers (for example Commands). Some implementations let you compose them. They usually live inside controllers _package_.  Do the authors of those implementations rename the C into somethings else? No!<p>There are some cases with different names (think MVP, MVVM) but they have a different form of relationship between the three parts of a pattern. Let&#x27;s look at the MOVE&#x27;s diagram. We actually have the original MVC diagram with a strange quirk: the controller (made from Operations) can directly affect the view.  Now we have a problem. There are two places in this architecture where the view gets updated: the view can get events from the model and update itself (oh horror! it&#x27;s active view!) or it can be directly updated by the Operation.<p>This doesn&#x27;t solve anything but makes programs built with this architecture harder to reason about and debug.<p>There are two ways to fix it:\n1. remove direct changes on view from controller then we have just MVC\n2. stop sending events from model to view and send them to controller then we have MVP<p>In the end I don&#x27;t see enough justification for calling it something new and using a special name for this particular pattern. Also this pattern is broken. Talking about the article itself, it&#x27;s neither academic, nor pragmatic and looks like a blatant attempt at self promotion. It&#x27;s a bullshit which puts words over meaning and misleads beginning programmers.",1378946729

All the stuff I am going to tell you is from my personal experience with my friends, and their stories.<p>Here&#x27;s how these body shops work:<p>1. Find a guy/gal who is a reasonable match for the job and place him/her in it. No problem with that.<p>2. The employee may not have prior experience in the field he claims he has in his resume. The body shops know this. They sometimes fix your resume for you.<p>3. If the body shops are not confident in you, they might arrange for a proxy to interview in your place for a &quot;charge&quot;. Most of the times in consulting, a phone interview usually suffices.<p>4. Some (good)body shops split the wage 80(for the employee)/20(for the employer). In case they did proxy someone in for you, they might divide it more evenly in their favor.<p>5.  The body shops may have someone in the said company where he is placing their candidate and they may receive kickbacks(few dollars/head/hour).<p>6. Usually the body shops are <i>scum</i> of the earth; if you think car dealers are the worst, think again. They will lie,beg,steal to make more money off of you in anyways they can.<p>7. And finally to come to your point, why H-1s are underpaid; In my experience they are not underpaid at all. They usually make twice of what I make(and I am a programmer in SV). It is just that they lie that it seems low. Many a time the body shop pays the employee about 50% in income as per-diem. All in all, it is not uncommon that they make 200k a year. However, remember that body shops are the worst of the worst people and they may steal your money and not pay for months on end sometimes. Depends on how desperate you are.",1378946128

6371162,comment,6367482,6369239,1,0,mikeash,,,"The question of hardware support for tagged pointers is interesting. Currently, objc_msgSend basically does (in pseudo-C):<p><pre><code>    if(self & 1) {\n        tagged_class_index = self & 0xf;\n        class = tagged_class_table[tagged_class_index]\n    } else {\n        class = *self;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd the rest is all common code that looks up the method implementation and jumps to it.<p>Within the method implementation itself, there will be some shifting to extract the value, but not much, since the method implementation already knows what class it&#x27;s in:<p><pre><code>    value = self >> 4;\n</code></pre>\nProducing new &quot;instances&quot; of the class as tagged pointers involves some shifting and logical ORing:<p><pre><code>    new_tagged_pointer = value << 4 | class_index;\n</code></pre>\n(Note that class_index is conceptually a 3-bit value, but the runtime treats it as a 4-bit value for which the bottom bit is always 1. The tagged_class_table has 16 entries but only the odd-numbered ones are used.)<p>Most of this is really fast on any modern CPU. The one part that could potentially be slow is the if statement up at the top, since that&#x27;s a candidate for mispredicted branches. I don&#x27;t know how much it matters, but I&#x27;d say that that would be the one place where a dedicated instruction might potentially be of use. You could eliminate the branch yourself, except for the fact that dereferencing self when it&#x27;s a tagged pointer will likely crash, so you have to avoid reading that value when you aren&#x27;t going to use it.<p>My guess is that the penalty for the branch there is small, but you&#x27;d have to do some benchmarking to say for sure. If modern CPUs are indeed able to predict that branch (or run both sides to completion internally, since they&#x27;re short), then there&#x27;s no need for a new instruction.",1378945698

If the pure function were the algorithm, then there would be no separating the two.  However, since a pure function can be calculated by several algorithms, then we are really just putting off some of the major points, no?  (Hell, even in the simple 8 * 2, we are glossing over what really happens.  Few programmers really appreciate the way in which that math happens on the computer.  And fewer still are aware of when this changes in their architecture.  And for anyone that thinks this is just some elementary exercise, I challenge that you have not seen the effort it takes children to really appreciate how to calculate 8 * 2.)<p>This is all really missing my main assertion, though.  What is your function for getting in your car and driving somewhere?  Could this be written in such a way that everything was a &quot;pure&quot; function?  Probably.  My hunch is that it wouldn&#x27;t really be that readable, though.  Now, if we shift the paradigm such that one of the &quot;primitives&quot; is your current location, suddenly the directions are a lot more readable.<p>For an easy example on what I mean here, just look elsewhere in the thread where folks were writing the program for cooking things.

(<a href=""http://sheplusplus.stanford.edu/sheStatistics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sheplusplus.stanford.edu/sheStatistics.pdf</a>). I can&#x27;t find the percentage of women among those who declare the CS major. From elsewhere, there are about 600 students in the intro course, 220 people declare the major, and 80 graduate. So 240 women in CS106A and 16 graduate. To argue that less than 80% of women drop out after declaring, we have to assume that 80 or fewer women declared a CS major, which means they made up approximately 1/3 of the declaring students, which sounds plausible to me.<p>The corresponding stats for male majors would be 140 declare the major and 64 graduate, so they lose 55% of declared students.

First I should mention that Kivy uses data-binding liberally.  It&#x27;s not events, it&#x27;s publisher-subscriber where bound functions receive the changes as their arguments.  This fixes many things, but Kivy uses a widget tree. Trees are great for reasoning about context, scope, relationship etc between graphics elements in layouts.<p>Trees are also an awful topology when something has a relationship to an element in another branch.  The controllers as I&#x27;m using them are globally visible and thus don&#x27;t need to be passed.  This would pollute namespaces except that a minimal number of controllers will recreate the topology of the problem space and not in tree-space.  The whole application can see &quot;out&quot; of the 2D tree into a graph that connects things with many fewer connections.  These few controllers have tons of logic, but it&#x27;s all program.  There&#x27;s very little related to how widgets display themselves, so this fat code is also very high-calorie, rich or whatever.<p>Fat controllers make me happy.  My program, the part that I think of as the program, exists all in one place and the bits that control how everything looks all belong in the tree.  Widgets don&#x27;t send events to my controllers often.  Occasionally it&#x27;s easier to reason through a problem using the property/data-binding system, but more often the data already exists in the on_press callback of the widget or whatever and there&#x27;s no need to secondarily send it through more sub/pub plumbing when I can just call a function of my global controller on the data.<p>I&#x27;m busy getting my code cleaned up and contributed.  It has really saved me untold time even in it&#x27;s nascent stages because of the fundamental topology conveniences.",1378944680

Certain things you&#x27;ve said are immediately and verifiably false. You&#x27;re not exactly screaming trustworthiness here, but anyway.<p>Making good investment decisions when it comes to green is HARD, as evidenced by the failures of KCPB (Fisker), the government (Solyndra), and the hesitance of YC (why does YC have a history of not accepting green ventures? Why don&#x27;t they get a partner who&#x27;s learned in this area? Danielle Fong is obviously brilliant (dropped out from Princeton at age 17... where she was doing her PhD), yet she was rejected by YC -- and went on to get funding from Khosla Ventures and Peter Thiel). The science of investment strategies when it comes to web companies is considerably easier - it is mostly solved to a great number of people, it isn&#x27;t that easy when it comes to green companies. I think it is logical then, considering that unlike the webspace, this is VC&#x27;s market, that the terms would be more favorable for them.<p>Anyway though, I wonder if you&#x27;ve got a bad impression of Khosla because of his sometimes brash mannerisms? His aggressive incisiveness?",1378944111

They couldn&#x27;t be agile because they had too much crap on the plate.<p>MS needs to have a haircut like Marissa Mayer gave Yahoo. Hardware and SAAS are not the way for MS; they need to get back into large(r) system OS dev in a big way, to run house and building automation. The game console should only be part of it. If they want to do hardware, it better be to run the code they write, otherwise they will be stomped.",1378944079

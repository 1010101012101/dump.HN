It's important for future work that they be eliminated.<p>The number of times I been able to talk to a climate scientist is few, but always full of hedging.  It's a young science and predictions are always difficult (to say the least.)  Scientific certainty is a sham.  The best bet is to consider near-term action an insurance policy against potential outcomes.",1258844240

The University of Alberta and others are studying the game but it will be some years yet before we have a poker equivalent of 'Deep Blue' beating the best players in the game.<p>The major poker sites are well know and trusted and have proved themselves competent in preventing 'cheating' like what you describe.

955056,comment,954924,955007,0,0,rdtsc,,,"Theoretically none. Quantum computers are universal Turing machines. The main advantage of quantum computers is speedup.<p>5 years ago (when I took a couple of courses in QC) there were basically 2 quantum algorithms -- Shor's factorization and Grover's search. The former speeds up integer factorization (and discrete logarithm) and brings it to polynomial time, and the later speeds up search from O(n) to O(sqrt(n)).<p>So just being able to quickly factor integers breaks a lot of encryption algorithms, and a faster search would really help with data processing.<p>One of the main difficulty with quantum computers is quantum de-coherence. Qubits when they are entangled must be isolated from the outside environment until the final result measurement is taken.  That is what is preventing the creation of large, multi-qubit computers.  For example, it would be useful to have a 1024 qubit machine to simultaneously represent all 1024 bit states.<p>Quantum error correction might solve the problem, but we are yet to see practical quantum computers.",1258844115

It does not, and humans place way more value on money than they do dogma, so evolution is safe and global warming will be controversial regardless of our ultimate findings.<p>Climate data does not make global warming a lightening-rod issue.  What makes it such a controversial issue is that, if true, it would require dramatic changes to the way the First World operates.",1258843941

A quantum system many physicists like to simulate is the Hubbard model (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model</a>) .

The distribution model is Dynamo/eventual consistency (there are, however, tunable ""knobs"": you can choose how much of either consistency, availability and partition tolerance you want to give up in favour of the other two). The storage backends are pluggable, but most commonly used ones are BerkeleyDB and read-only (for data built off-line). Latency is low, throughput is high and there isn't a single point of failure. I am presently working full time on a feature that enables additional nodes (and thus capacity) to be added as a cluster is running (and serving live requests).<p>HBase is a BigTable style columnar style (with support for certain kinds of range queries: see the Google BigTable paper). The distribution model is strong consistency, the backing store is built on top of Hadoop's HDFS. Hadoop's name mode is the single central point / ""special"" node (although there's work being done by the Hadoop team on having multiple namenodes, afaik).<p>Cassandra takes yet another approach, mixing parts of Dynamo's consistency/distribution model with parts of BigTable's data model.<p>The two are different projects, solving different problems.

It's almost a religious kind of awe, and so when American powerbrokers visit Japan there is a kind of unsaid understanding that the Japanese aristocrats will make concessions and ""pay tribute"". After WW2 all the current Mitsubishi Group banks very much became an international operation. And it holds tremendous power, and yet is extremely - almost inexplicably - conciliatory to America.<p>Some Japanese people are unhappy with this vassal kind of relationship between their most powerful institutions (which, let's face it, are the political Kingmakers of Japan just like the corporatocracy in America) and the Western Elite.",1258843263

If GM failed the effects would not have been limited directly to their workers. Unfortunately, thousands of dealerships rely on the viability of General Motors. That includes salespersons up to managers and owners. It also includes the parts industry which is sizeable itself, so we're talking many thousands of jobs indirectly connected to GM additionally lost. Worse still, would have been the timing. A big reason the credit markets were freezing up and the stock market was tanking was psychological - people <i>thought</i> things would get worse. Think about a stock market crash, which is essentially everyone selling and nobody buying. The selloff doesn't happen right away; buyers turn into sellers because everybody is selling, which can lead to the whole thing crashing.",1258843111

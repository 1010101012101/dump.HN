The design is a monolithic do everything fully integrated suite. The combinatorial explosion of interacting features that MSOffice has going on is enough to make a mathematician blush (and the testing staff cry). A super large scale SDLC type one size fits all solution, not based on a generic powerful concept, but a gigantic feature blob that deals with problems as they come.<p>It's a god damned miracle, and LibreOffice is what happens when you don't get a miracle. It's a feature blob, it's buggy (last time on my system it used 100% CPU, and every time I adjusted a field in a dialog box it didn't redraw the background), it has surprising behavior (play with tables some time, now try sizing them). Hey, I'm no fan of Microsoft Office, either.<p>I'd say I like LaTeX, but that's a generic powerful concept with absolutely no concessions made for John Q Hacker.

5823787,comment,5823479,5823479,3,0,Everlag,,,"The thing about schools and computers is that it really is a losing battle on the part of the school. They wish to provide the students with easy to access to tech to allow them to become intimately familiar with it to advance in the world.<p>Then they have students use computers for the most simplistic things. Typing up essays and getting to piece together a video in windows movie maker is the absolute extent of what the above average Canadian high school can do. They don't understand, they being the old guard of teaching, the things a modern computer can do because they think in analogue methodologies, not digital.<p>Only within the last few years have we replaced overheads and transparencies with 'smart boards' and projectors and even then, few teachers have been found to use them in any manner other than an even more LIMITED version of the traditional overhead. Very recently the younger teachers have built small wordpress sites or shared google drives for notes because of ease and personal comfort which is a giant step forward but moot for all it does to solve the issue of the unsavvy teachers.<p>If a school were to wise up and switch to open source, the amount of headache from staff is simply impossible to imagine. The students can understand the rapid pace of technology and the very new or extremely impassioned teachers can cope with it where the older teachers throw their hands into the air and bring out the transparencies. A billion dollars to the person to come up with a way of easily transitioning them to modern method.<p>Sorry for the rant, but education hits close to home for me.",1370408148

A studio tends to be about 50 people, maybe as big as a hundred.<p>In those, there were many people that liked their job.  By job I mean, the challenges, the scale, and environment.  I only met a handful that were jazzed up about the game they were working on... and that was usually the most heartbreaking, because they just never had an opportunity to change things for the better as far as game design, or the art.  There are two specific people I know as exceptions, that are tenacious as hell, and made concessions only when absolutely necessary.  Total respect for them, but they're still pretty beaten down and discouraged.<p>Intermittently, a lot of people got excited about games.  Overall a lot of people derided the games they were making, a lot of the time.",1370408135

5823778,comment,5823479,5823479,10,0,wiredfool,,,"In my area, it's that the technology budget is separate from the general fund budget. The general fund, which pays for teachers, facilities maintenance, and things like libraries is squeezed by falling payments from the state and a cap on the amount of local contribution. We're losing teachers each year (I think 7 years and counting) and the overall budget is down about 35% from the peak in the early 2000s. The local voters haven't rejected a general levy in many years, although they did reject a capital levy for a renovation to combine two schools. (that would have closed a school campus that dates from the early 1900s and needs seismic upgrades to be safe, and moved the students to the half empty high school)<p>The tech budget is funded by separate tech levies, which can only be spent on computers or tech related staff.<p>This leaves the district in the strange place of being able to afford iPads all around for a couple grades in middle school, but not being able to afford a librarian for the primary school.

The pressure is just the sum weight of the column of fluid above you. Since water is (basically) incompressible, the density is the same at any depth, so, the fluid weight is proportional to the column height. At ~10 meters, it's 1.03 kgf per cm^2 or 1 atmosphere (on top of one atmosphere of air above, for 2 atmospheres total).<p>It's the opposite for air. That's a compressible gas, so density increases with pressure, which makes pressure an <i>exponential</i> function of altitude.

5823641,comment,5817728,5823232,6,0,oblique63,,,"Thank you for saying this. It really bothers me how arguments are reduced to meaningless 'facts' around here so quickly, when the real world is a lot more nuanced than that.  A 'fact' without context is effectively meaningless (i.e. saying ""the sky is blue"" would be useless if we had no concept of a ""sky""). The simple fact that ""coercion"" is defined in such a way that aligns with the way taxation is implemented is about as useful as one of those ""fun facts"" you see under snapple caps. Yeah, that's nice coincidence, but it's really only notable when you look at it for what it is: a relation between a word definition and a system implementation. In other words, the connotation of the word and the context of the system implementation are not necessarily guaranteed to be congruent, as there are many paths that lead to the same destination.  And as you clearly stated, taxation is just a <i>special case</i> of the more general practice of governance through law enforcement. And while a lot of people here like to see 'law' as equal to 'right-ness', it too is not necessarily congruent but rather a close approximation (much the same way that I.Q. scores are a rough approximation of 'intelligence' -- another relatively 'vague' concept).  What's funny, is that this incongruence makes itself pretty clear whenever drug laws are brought up. Several clamor to ""legalize"", yet many of the same people then go on use law/law-enforcement as an accurate metric for 'right-ness' in argumentation. The thing is that law <i>is</i> a pretty good metric for what society deems to be right <i>in general</i> for practical usage in <i>implementing guidelines</i>, but the system behind it is never going to be responsive/fast/informed enough to represent a useful snapshot of societal values that can then be used for argumentation[1]. If culture/society were generally static then that would be fine, but this big mess of dynamic interactions is much too complicated, so we just resort to using simple arbitrary factoids to end discussions.<p>[1] Not to mention that a government's body of law as a whole is not generated by a fixed algorithm; different laws arise from different needs/contexts/scenarios, and not understanding what context brought about any specific policy, yet still using it in argumentation, is essentially a strawman.",1370405589

5823631,comment,5820470,5822748,1,0,malkia,,,"> What is the key point that made it necessary?<p>Returning complex objects, without requiring them to be manually freed by whoever picked them (caller).<p>Also in certain languages - garbage collection actually allows saving of memory. If all strings are immutable, then ""one"", ""one"" and ""one"" might be stored in one place, and whoever asked for them would get the same place (you'll also get the benefit of using only pointer comparison, instead of strcmp). For this gc is needed - e.g. you return things, but you don't specify who owns them. It's just that much later an ""agency"" starts looking from the certain roots to track down which things are still owned, and which not.<p>For example - cherry tree - start from the root - all cherries on the tree are owned, all on the ground are no longer - they can be collected. Poor analogy, but it might work for some people.<p>One more point - if you have 1,000,000 mallocs and then frees then this might be much slower than having 1,000,000 allocations through a garbage collector and freeing them.<p>In the former case there is this form of ""micro-management"" - e.g. you have manually micro managed every allocation out there, and then you've had manually micro managed to free it.<p>Instead the garbage collector might free everything in few sweeps. Also the allocation with garbage collector can be sometimes as simple as moving a pointer ahead.<p>In the past CGI services were notorious for being slow when shutting down the process. A big portion of this was freeing the memory. In fact you don't need this, when a process is shutdown, no memory needs to be freed - e.g. this is a bit like ad-hoc garbage collection.<p>Another example was Pascal - there were mark/release regions. You can mark something, and then with release you would free all blocks at once allocated after the mark.<p>Such things are useful, when you don't want to suffer from too much malloc/free, but would like to keep sane non-gc collection scheme.<p>And lastly reference counting - it's another form of garbage collection/manual freeing, and it's used quite a lot. There is one problem - most of the implementations cannot handle cycles, and all of them suffer the penalty of dealing with the internal counter, which is even worse when more CPU's have to touch it.",1370405178

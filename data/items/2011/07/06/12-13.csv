But for a lot of internet users - maybe most of them - the internet is viewed through the slit of Google Search, so to speak. And this used to be fine, since Google would helpfully point you on your way to where you want to go.<p>We used to laugh at people who came to some forum or newsgroup and asked ""how much should this cost"" or whatever. Can't you google that, buddy? Well, you really can't anymore.<p>Oh, and for the category of products at which you hinted - spam-flavored pseudo-viral marketing is even more annoying than search engine optimization. But yes, I do get the idea of going directly to trusted sources and skipping the search engine; the problem is that search engines were invented because they are so convenient, and it would be a shame to lose that.",1309957130

That's the reason that employees in startups are willing to work 80+ hours a week.<p>Generally, those employees would be much better off financially working at a Java shop that paid more.  But, startup employees tend to spin off and start their own startups.  Having a front row seat in a startup, and learning from the founder's fails and wins is also worth something.  Also chances are, you're probably not going to get to built stuff in Node, Haskell, Erlang, Python, etc... at BigCo.  That's probably also worth a price differential to account for the risk involved in choosing ""unproven"" technologies.<p>Finally, there is a substantial risk that the startup you're working for is going to go belly up.  And, the founders of the startup are generally making less per hour than you are.  And, despite rumors to the contrary, the average startup in Silicon Valley works really, really hard to get funded.  Many, many great companies are under capitalized right now.  Everybody from the founders to the employees are working below market salaries with the hopes that some day the exit will pay off.",1309956961

I regard it as self-indulgent, but interesting to those so inclined. Like Mathematics, it's an a priori subject anyone can do from an armchair. Unlike Mathematics, it isn't that useful for science. But unlike mathematics, it will help you achieve understanding about the structure of how you ordinarily think about the world (if not the world itself).<p>You can construe the cogito as an argument:<p>P1 I think.<p>P2 If I think, then I exist<p>C1 I exist.<p>P1 and P2 are premises, C1 is derived.<p>The interesting point is that P1 is not arbitrary, in the sense that if one grasps it, then it is true.<p>That's a really interesting property for a claim to have - especially for a contingent claim to have (e.g. 2+2=4 is necessarily true, and so if one grasps it, trivially it is true, but that's not interesting in the same way).<p>Further, D thinks that if one grasps it, then one knows one grasps it, (and that it is true).<p>So for D we have a priori certain knowledge of a contingent claim.<p>If course, you can question 2, and some people have. Quine is one person to read on that.<p>Re 'what does it mean to exist' - what do you mean by that? Your criticism demonstrates some ignorance of Descartes, as Descartes makes substantive claims about the nature of his existence as revealed by the reasonining in Mediations. For example D would say he knows that he exists as a thinking subject - a substantive claim about his nature. He goes on to make lots of controversial claims about his nature (some of which get us to Cartesian Dualism).",1309955930

That means that the annualized cost for talented engineering is $250k to $350k per year.<p>Paying for laundry, dinners, etc... to keep those employees productive and happy is a rounding error.<p>I've worked for years in an industry where a certain class of employees get paid at least $150k, up to $800k per year.  These people get their laundry done for free.  They walk around in clothing that is remarkably similar to pajamas, and these people often sleep on in special rooms dedicated to letting them sleep.  Indeed, these people often put on their pajama uniforms when they walk into the building, sleep in them, and then change and go home.<p>These people get special parking permits, they get free food in the cafeteria.  They have entire staff's devoted to making them as productive as possible.  In fact, there are entire occupational disciplines devoted to making this class of employees as productive as possible, and make sure they have to do as little menial work as possible.<p>These people are doctors.  And, there are entire disciplines devoted to making different specialties as productive as possible.  Cardiac Cath Lab tech's and Cath lab nurses are on call 24/7, and their job is to make sure that _everything_ aside from patient care is taken care of for the doctor.  Often, the Interventional Cardiologist walks in, talks to the patient on a gurney, looks at an EKG, and then goes and dictates a chart while a team of 3 nurses and tech's set up the patient, get the Flouroscopy machine ready, and call the physician back into the room to perform the procedure for 45 minutes.<p>No one blinks twice that the cardiologist gets to wear hospital provided scrubs, has a call room where they can sleep in, gets fed for free in the cafeteria, has special parking spots, has a physician lounge with free newspapers, deluxe coffee and snacks stocked 24/7/365.  Why?<p>Because a busy Cardiologist in a single day, might place 10 pacemakers $30k a piece in 10 different patients. The hospital can bill $80k to 100k a piece for the procedure, and make enough money to care for the uninsured hoards in the Emergency Department.<p>Why then, do we balk at an engineer getting laundry done, wearing comfy clothes to work, or being able to wear a fake mustache once a week?  The engineer :: user ratio at Yelp is about 1 :: 2 Million last I heard.  It's about the same at Facebook and Reddit.<p>The only other industries where the employee to revenue ratio is comparable or better are the oil industries and the finance industries.  Pay for software engineers is only now starting to catch up to the revenue that they are able to generate for a company.<p>Also, the software industry, and in particular the startup industry is built from ""creatives"".<p>What perks do other ""creative"" industries enjoy?  No one thinks twice about playful, creatively colored rooms, toys laying around at a design or advertising agency in Amsterdam or New York City.  If I were lead writer for a television show in Los Angeles and I had a bull pen of 12 writers that got together and wrote scripts for TV shows every week, I'd make sure that those writers had anything and everything they needed to spur creativity and focus on writing great copy.<p>Why should software startups be any different?  Perks are cheap.  Engineers are _really expensive.  Keep those engineers happy.  If you're doing anything less than that, you're not spending your money well.",1309954420

This project is a side project and I have full time job.

I have never seen BTX being widely used here but when I was on vacation in France, sure enough even the rest stops on the highway had a few minitel terminals you could pay for. And that was around 94 or 95 when the internet has already been heard of around here in Europe and the first ISPs started popping up.",1309953760

Every single laptop, notebook, game console or handset on the market today uses S3 tech, and now HTC has the ability to stop them from being sold. This is just the kind of blunt instrument that HTC needs to keep Apple and it's patent claims at bay.",1309953695

I guess you're asumming that WP7 phones are only beneficial to MSFT instead of both MSFT & Samsung.<p>What if, i'm not saying it will happen and i find it unlikely, Google starts hardening the Android rules for new releases? Samsung, as well as other handset manufacturers, need to diversificate.<p>Samsung has bada, but that's for mid, mid-low handsets. HTC & Motorola have nothing afaik (correct me if i'm wrong).<p>> They saw they can't make money with their own product<p>Yup<p>> while WP7 is not at all and it sits around 1% market share right now, and dropping.<p>I'm superinterested in smartphone stats, where's that dropping in WP7? it's not ""super-growing"", but it's not dropping either.<p>> Does Microsoft think this will make consumers more likely to buy their phones?<p>Consumers don't care about this.",1309953674

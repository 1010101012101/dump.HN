I really, really, really miss sliding keyboards.<p>How would a game like Twisted Metal work on a phone? A tablet? Screen controls, for me at least, don&#x27;t have the responsiveness you want, and the lack of available buttons makes it hard to do anything beyond one to three button layouts. One game that managed this pretty well was Swordigo, but that was with nothing but left, right, jump, attack, and a special weapon. For that matter, how would you make Doom work on a phone halfway decently? Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat? Touch screens are a sad replacement for real buttons, and today&#x27;s devices are pretty much universal crap for lacking them. The best typing experience I ever had was Android on an HTC Touch Pro 2 because it had a sublimely wonderful keyboard, and that phone ran Windows Mobile 6.5 by default!",1407844452

8167378,comment,8166701,8166701,25,0,michaelochurch,,,"This may be &quot;(1998)&quot; but it&#x27;s timeless and everyone who&#x27;s had (or been) a micromanager or a bad boss could stand to read it. It describes the micromanagement death spiral well. It also explains why about a third to a half of people in closed-allocation companies, no matter how talented they would be in a better context, are going to fail. Open allocation gives the individuals multiple opportunities to roll the dice and takes that failure rate down to about 2%.<p>For all our noise about &quot;meritocracy&quot;, the truth is that social status matters a great deal in the workplace. I&#x27;ve written about this here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/how-the-other-half-works-an-adventure-in-the-low-status-of-software-engineers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/how-the-other...</a><p>In addition to what&#x27;s described in the paper, and very relevant to the sorts of ultra-hard-working people you find in tech, high status is right-to-care. If you have low status and care a lot about your work and doing things the right way, you&#x27;re &quot;pushy&quot; and &quot;entitled&quot;. If you&#x27;re of high status, you&#x27;re dedicated and creative.<p>Working hard from a position of low social status does absolutely nothing. In fact, it makes your situation worse because it lowers your status even further. A low-status person who puts in long hours is seen as compensating for inability, and if that person stops putting in long hours, the relative drop (&quot;downward trend in performance&quot;) is what will be noted.<p>This paper doesn&#x27;t discuss the real way out. It&#x27;s not to work harder. It&#x27;s also not &quot;communication&quot; (even though &quot;communication breakdown&quot; is the polite term for this scenario) because the communication between the manager and low-status subordinate is destined to be one-way. The best odds are with escape: transfer to another group under someone who likes you. However, if that can&#x27;t be done, the next best option is <i>social proof</i>. Gain the blessing of a high-status person. You can&#x27;t really do this on your own team (the high-status people don&#x27;t want to be associated with the low-status ones) so you need to gain the approval of someone of equal or higher status (formal and informal) to your boss and to have your boss know. Of course, this can be dangerous (you appear to be a flight risk) and if you&#x27;re caught or you fail, it&#x27;ll be interpreted in the worst possible way, but it&#x27;s the only reliable way out of the bottom on this one, and it&#x27;s surprisingly quick when the &quot;magic&quot; of social proof works.",1407844113

What makes a bike a pain to store besides length is the handle bars and foot pegs stick out. So design a handle bar with a pin so it can be rotated alone the bikes axis when parked and folding pedals.

Their whole talk, for me, circles around the &quot;someone plugs in a USB device with surprising functionality&quot; narrative... And there are two possible things that can go on. First, the device could try to exploit flaws in parsing of USB descriptors. This is how the PS2, I think, was sucessfully rooted/unlocked/made-linux-run-on-it.<p>But the talk linked to mainly focuses on the second possibility: &quot;the OS automatically loads the driver for keyboards and network adapterse&quot;, and this is trivially defended against, at least on Linux. I assume you can do similar/identical things on other operating systems (e.g. Windows probably has a registry key for that, because it always has registry keys for everything...)<p><pre><code>        # echo 0 >/sys/bus/usb/drivers_autoprobe\n</code></pre>\nNow, no drivers are bound to USB devices automatically. Just try it. I plugged in peripherals into the computer, the only thing you&#x27;ll get (running 3.15.8-1-ARCH, archlinux x64) is the following text in the dmesg:<p><pre><code>        [ 6765.949361] usb 5-1: new low-speed USB device number 3 using uhci_hcd  **mouse**\n        [ 6846.469357] usb 6-1: new high-speed USB device number 3 using ehci-pci **harddisk**\n        [ 7062.616021] usb 7-4.4: new high-speed USB device number 7 using ehci-pci **eth/network**\n</code></pre>\nNow, if I am convinced that one of the devices hasn&#x27;t been tampered with, I&#x27;ll run the following command, that triggers automatic probing for a single USB device (1.0 is configuration 1, function 0, I think...)<p><pre><code>        # echo 7-4.4:1.0 >/sys/bus/usb/drivers_probe \n</code></pre>\ndmesg shows....<p><pre><code>        [ 7193.076584] ax88179_178a 7-4.4:1.0 eth0: register &#x27;ax88179_178a&#x27; at usb-0000:00:1d.7-4.4, ASIX AX88179 USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet, 00:0a:cd:22:b4:40\n        [ 7193.099754] systemd-udevd[10470]: renamed network interface eth0 to enp0s29f7u4u4\n</code></pre>\nBut if I only want to allow USB storage devices, I can manually bind to the usb storage driver.<p><pre><code>       # modprobe usb-storage # was not loaded on my machine, yet...\n       # echo 1 >/sys/bus/usb/devices/6-1/bConfigurationValue  # enable 1st configuration\n       # echo 6-1:1.0 >/sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb-storage/bind \n</code></pre>\ndmesg, again...<p><pre><code>       [ 7583.801824] usbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage\n       [ 7729.898188] usb-storage 6-1:1.0: USB Mass Storage device detected\n       [ 7729.898404] scsi6 : usb-storage 6-1:1.0\n       [ 7730.900552] scsi 6:0:0:0: Direct-Access     TOSHIBA  MK4309MAT        G5.0 PQ: 0 ANSI: 0 CCS\n       [ 7730.904913] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdd] 8452080 512-byte logical blocks: (4.32 GB/4.02 GiB)\n</code></pre>\nNow, this of course is completely ridiculous, from a user-interface perspective, but, I think if you only want to cover mounting of USB sticks, you can script this in shell/perl/python/awk, using &quot;lsusb -v&quot; for parsing the binary USB descriptors and only start usb-storage on USB sticks.<p><i>EDIT</i>/<i>ADDED</i>: -----<p>And also note: The mechanism described above concerns the binding of drivers to devices. There&#x27;s a different facility in place to make USB devices inaccessible to the drivers/the user, and that&#x27;s using the &quot;authorized&quot; flags: You set the &quot;autorized_default&quot; flag in /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb<N> to 0, then every device that is connected to the machine is initially disabled:<p><pre><code>       [ 9162.809251] usb 7-4.4: new high-speed USB device number 11 using ehci-pci\n       [ 9162.912337] usb 7-4.4: Device is not authorized for usage\n</code></pre>\nIf you are sure that this particular device is allowed to connect, authorize it...<p><pre><code>       # echo 1 >/sys/bus/usb/devices/7-4.4/authorized \n\n       [ 9214.302656] ax88179_178a 7-4.4:1.0 eth0: register &#x27;ax88179_178a&#x27; at usb-0000:00:1d.7-4.4, ASIX AX88179 USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet, 00:0a:cd:22:b4:40\n       [ 9214.302678] usb 7-4.4: authorized to connect\n       [ 9214.326028] systemd-udevd[10771]: renamed network interface eth0 to enp0s29f7u4u4\n</code></pre>\nThat way, you could have the publicly accessible USB connectors (say... usb2 and usb4) in &quot;autorized_default=0&quot; mode, and the internal USB connectors, or the ones on the back of a device that is somewhat physically secured set to &quot;autorized_default=1&quot; to not impede usage and comfort... But, of course, if you have scripts in place implementing a &quot;USB ACL&quot;, that doesn&#x27;t really sound as if it&#x27;s worth the added complexity?",1407842815

Should the penalty be proportional to the effect it has on the victim? Steal from the poor and suffer more?<p>Crime occurs when penalties make it more profitable to commit the crime than not. The cost to society is paying to prosecute, reform, or lockup, people who do not adhere to the standards of the society they live in.<p>How about community service, at minimum wage until the work equals the value of what was stolen even if even the items were recovered?

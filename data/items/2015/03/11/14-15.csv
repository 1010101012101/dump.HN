It&#x27;s an awful language, beloved of those who&#x27;ve never had to maintain someone else&#x27;s code.<p>> Or, since you brought up Ruby, the industry by and large didn&#x27;t care about its existence for roughly the first decade of its life, though I suppose that&#x27;s only half-damned.<p>Yes. Ruby is an uninteresting language. Rails was the kind of innovation in framework design that&#x27;s so insightful that it now seems obvious and it&#x27;s hard to remember that we would have thought differently, and by an accident of history it was in Ruby. Industry popularity turns out to track the really important innovations, who&#x27;d&#x27;ve thought?<p>> JavaScript was released by a company barely a year old in an emerging market. A partner (another decades old entrenched player) of the neophyte company wanted the language nerfed and positioned as a toy, and got some of what it wanted.<p>Javascript had the huge advantage of being required to effectively use the most popular application in history. The fair comparison is with something like Visual Basic during the rise of Word, except that most word documents never needed a single macro. Or perhaps to the things people make with Excel, even if it&#x27;s not a &quot;real&quot; programming language. If Javascript were the perfect language handed down on tablets of stone, if it were Idris 20 years ahead of its time, it wouldn&#x27;t have got much more adoption - and if it were the devil&#x27;s own, MUMPS back from the dead, it wouldn&#x27;t have got much less. The factors driving its adoption were simply unconnected to its strengths or weaknesses as a language, because there simply was no alternative for the overwhelming majority of Javascript use cases.<p>If you compare it to a grassroots contemporary, a language without the corporate sponsorship, how does it fare? Going by Wikipedia those look to be PHP, Ruby and OCaml. It&#x27;s not clear-cut, but all of those feel more mature than JS to me.",1426085957

SQL is not very pretty or friendly IMO, ORMs clean it up a bit (for example allowing arbitrary ordering, sqli, construction of multiple queries from one base). The example I gave was an arel query - very similar to yours if you move the WHERE out into the function name.<p>Your ORM proposal above looks fine (and very similar to existing ones but with more strings), but personally I find it uglier than the many which are available, and you haven&#x27;t actually tackled the protection against sqli or explained how that would work. Normally you&#x27;d pass that through to the db driver as a $n param, rather than trying to escape a string at the ORM level. If your ORM is going to infer details from the sql, it basically has to parse that sql first and handle all the same things that current ORMs do by using named functions to add SQL - you&#x27;d find the same issues with consistency and edge cases I imagine, and of course have to be very careful about parameters and sqli.<p>So if you don&#x27;t like ORMs, don&#x27;t use them, but you do have to be sure that your own ad-hoc home-grown ORM that you&#x27;re writing instead covers all the bases current ones do. I prefer the syntax of the ones you&#x27;re denigrating for simple queries, even if for complex queries it might be better to write sql directly (via the functions they provide), but would be interested to see it in action - when are you going to start :)",1426085840

But what makes code maintainable?  When we&#x27;re teaching new developers, what do we tell them to do to make their code maintainable?  How do we distinguish between code that is maintainable, and code that is not maintainable?  That&#x27;s really the important thing; just knowing it should be &quot;maintainable&quot; doesn&#x27;t particularly help.<p>And &quot;readable&quot; is even more complicated.  Sure, there are some syntactic things that help readability—consistent indentation and spacing, good variable names, organized files, shorter lines.  But beyond that it kinda breaks down.  What makes a method readable?  Well, probably a small number of lines, few branches, single purpose.  That&#x27;s good.  But when you extend that to a codebase, you end up with code that you need to jump between a dozen methods to follow what happens in any given call.  Is that readable?  Or if you look at it from a class level, having a few methods where the whole chain of logic is in a single place is readable—but then you end up with giant god methods that do way too much.  Is that readable?  Presumably the balance is somewhere in the middle, but how do we recognize it?  Just saying code should be &quot;readable&quot; doesn&#x27;t really help.<p>Or &quot;covered by automated tests&quot;—definitely tests are helpful.  Except for bad tests, which are harmful, and make fixing bugs or refactoring a painful process.  So &quot;covered by tests&quot; can be good, or it can be bad, and adding the wrong tests can make your codebase worse.  How do we distinguish between good tests and bad tests?<p>So I agree that the things mentioned are true about good code, but way too vague to help write better code.",1426085135

We design and implement a new gradual type system, prototyped for expediency as a ‘Safe’ compilation mode for TypeScript.1 Our compiler achieves soundness by enforcing stricter static checks and embedding residual runtime checks in compiled code. It emits plain JavaScript that runs on stock virtual machines. Our main theorem is a simulation that ensures that the checks introduced by Safe TypeScript (1) catch any dynamic type error, and (2) do not alter the semantics of type-safe TypeScript code.<p>Safe TypeScript is carefully designed to minimize the performance overhead of runtime checks. At its core, we rely on two new ideas: differential subtyping, a new form of coercive subtyping that computes the minimum amount of runtime type information that must be added to each object; and an erasure modality, which we use to safely and selectively erase type information. This allows us to scale our design to full-fledged TypeScript, including arrays, maps, classes, inheritance, overloading, and generic types.<p>We validate the usability and performance of Safe TypeScript empirically by typechecking and compiling more than 100,000 lines of existing TypeScript source code. Although runtime checks can be expensive, the end-to-end overhead is small for code bases that already have type annotations. For instance, we bootstrap the Safe TypeScript compiler (90,000 lines including the base TypeScript compiler): we measure a 15% runtime overhead for type safety, and also uncover programming errors as type-safety violations. We conclude that (1) large TypeScript projects can easily be ported to Safe TypeScript, thereby increasing the benefits of existing type annotations, (2) Safe TypeScript can reveal programming bugs both statically and dynamically, (3) statically type code incurs negligible overhead, and (4) selective RTTI can ensure type safety with modest overhead.",1426084638

Maximum entropy means that your codebase should contain as much concentrated &quot;information&quot; as possible in relation to its size. Free of copy & paste code and repetitions that can be reused in libraries, methods and classes. This ensures less code to maintain , easier to spot bugs and easier to spot patterns.<p>2. Understandability (that includes readable): That means no blob classes or methods with an infinite number of purposes. Each layer of abstraction simple enough to keep in mind in its entirety.<p>3. Maintainable: It should be bug resistant, making it hard to do the wrong things and easy to do the right (for example putting required parameters into constructors rather than fields or properties). You should be able to replace and/or modify individual parts without side effects. Having as little code as possible also helps with this.<p>I think &quot;covered by automated&quot; tests are nice ... in some cases.

7747255,comment,7746585,7746585,7,0,pdeuchler,,,"Seriously, who is building this DRM software/hardware? If you are a software developer you have no excuse but ignorance, and as someone who makes a living on a computer (where the Internet resides) that excuse is waning <i>extremely</i> thin. I harbor a hairs breadth more grace for the hardware engineers designing locked down chips, but that&#x27;s no more than a rhetorical nicety due to the fact that I&#x27;m am not very familiar with the intricacies of their work.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t get it, you could make just as much, if not more, money doing something that&#x27;s not 100% ethically wrong... especially in this job market! It&#x27;s easy to work remotely, so you can&#x27;t claim geographic entrapment.

So its value only grows linearly with the number of users that can receive it.<p>More importantly, though, content is more compelling than browsers, and browsers are easier to switch. If Firefox blocks its n users from receiving some content, some fraction of those will leave Firefox and get the content anyway, leaving Firefox with less strength to fight the next battle. In this case, it looks like that fraction would be pretty significant, and the impact on DRM not that great.",1400111794

Adobe does not need to give up the right to sue people who release cracks for their DRM or competing products in order to do this.<p>>In an era in which vulnerabilities are leveraged to expose users to identity theft, sexual exploitation and government surveillance, no one should fear legal reprisal for warning people about flaws in the software they use.<p>Additionally, we need to focus on ways to educate users about the risks of DRM and disincentive web sites from using DRM wherever possible.",1400111792
7747244,comment,7725736,7746426,2,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Some data from the Wikipedia: <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Distribution_of_Annual_Household_Income_in_the_United_States_2012.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Distribu...</a><p>The median US income of a household, was about 50K in 2012. It&#x27;s not poor, possibly even comfortable, but if we assume this is 2 parents with one or 2 children, quitting a job means cutting that budget by two.  Unless of course you can rely on unemployment insurance —I don&#x27;t know the US system.<p>But most interesting is the <i>mode</i> of the distribution: meaning the most common income.  Income distribution is not a bell curve, and the mode happen to be much lower than the median: about 20K per year.  The bottom 25% is already kinda struggling.  They&#x27;re not going to quit their day jobs, nor take a pay cut to work part time.  They&#x27;re also probably too worried about making ends meet to try and build a company on the little spare time they have left.<p>Also, even if you don&#x27;t have a massive hospital bill, you <i>may</i> have one later, especially if you have a crappy insurance (thank goodness I live in France).  That&#x27;s not very reassuring, and is one of the many things that just rouse fear.  When you&#x27;re afraid you don&#x27;t take risks.  Building a company looks risky.  There&#x27;s an emotional risk at the very least.<p>Then there&#x27;s peer pressure.  HN is a very unusual place, talking about building companies all over the place,  Paul Graham speaking about entrepreneurship replacing employment, how we look up to the <i>failures</i> even (that last one is a good thing, by the way).  Most of the rest of the world just tells you to get a &quot;real&quot; job instead.  Over and over.  Moms, friends, media…  Many politicians even try to solve unemployment with incentives to the <i>unemployed</i>!  (Pro tip:  if they are 95 jobs and 100 unemployed, searching harder won&#x27;t work.)<p>Finally, there&#x27;s a general sense of depression and helplessness.  People expect their children to be <i>worse</i> off than they are, and they generally feel there is nothing they can do about it.  Collective action is possible, but our culture tend to emphasise great individuals —see for example the Steve Jobs semi-cult.  Unless they think of themselves exceptional as well, they are not likely to figuratively leave the pack, and build their company.<p>And there&#x27;s school, who rewards being on time, obedient, and ignores creativity, when it doesn&#x27;t actively stifle it.  It&#x27;s meant to produce the workers the elite need to stay rich.  It&#x27;s not meant to produce entrepreneurs and other such free thinkers.  They don&#x27;t even teach us the most important stuff!  (I know it sounds conspiratorial, but it&#x27;s really just powerful people and institutions protecting themselves, as they always did.  For instance: the most important aspect of our economy is monetary policy, and the most important aspect of monetary policy is Fractional Reserve Banking, which is best translated by &quot;private banks print most of the money&quot;.  If schools taught that, we&#x27;d risk a revolution.)<p>Really, in such a hostile environment, it takes an unusual kind of person to even dare start a business.<p>Or a privileged one.",1400111780

We have since ripped that stuff out. They did also contribute a lot of very valuable things, most notably security fixes and new web platform features that <i>were</i> useful.

7747121,comment,7746750,7746925,1,0,coherentpony,,,">This is what I would expect from the underlying mathematics. NaN roughly means the output of a function is undefined,<p>That&#x27;s not true, NaN means &quot;not a number&quot;.  Take for example f(x) = 1/x.  What is f(0)?  Infinity?  Well, you can&#x27;t divide by zero.  In fact, I tricked you.  When you talk about a function in mathematics, you need more information that just the formula, you also need to know over what domain I am allowed to evaluate such a function.  What I <i>should</i> have said was, define f: [1, 2] -> R s.t. f(x) = 1/x.  Now you are not allowed to ask the question, &quot;what is f(0)?&quot; because I didn&#x27;t include zero in the domain.  You might then ask, &quot;so how do you define f at zero?&quot;  That question mentions &#x27;f&#x27;, but the &#x27;f&#x27; it is referring to is now different.  Such an &#x27;f&#x27; you <i>are</i> allowed to ask this question for would be the following:<p>f:[0, 2] -> R<p>f(x) = 1/x when x > 0<p>f(0) = 1<p>Now, when you ask me what f(0) is, I can tell you.  It is 1.  &quot;That&#x27;s cheating!&quot; you might add.  No it isn&#x27;t.  It is a different function with different properties.  Just because the formula is the same does not mean you can evaluate it wherever you want.<p>Note:  you are not allowed to divide by zero.  The result would be meaningless if you could.  And &#x27;NaN&#x27; is only something the computer spits out when it encounters an operation that doesn&#x27;t return a number.  <i>Usually</i>, a computer will give you &#x27;Inf&#x27; when you try to divide by zero numerically.  Mathematically, you cannot do it.  So don&#x27;t try.<p>NaN means &#x27;not a number&#x27;, and &#x27;=&#x27; is an infix operator to compare numbers.  You can&#x27;t compare for equality on things that are not numbers.<p>You <i>can</i> compare infinities, however.  &quot;I thought you said dividing by zero was meaningless!&quot;  It is.  I&#x27;m not going to divide by zero, but I can still talk about infinity.  Take for example the following function:<p>f: (0, 1] -> R<p>f(x) = 1/x<p>f is defined on every number strictly greater then zero, but less than or equal to one.  Zero is not in the domain, so I can&#x27;t evaluate f there.  However, I can still study what happens <i>near</i> zero.  Take a really small number bigger than zero.  The reciprocal of that is huge.  Now take a smaller number, the reciprocal becomes even bigger.  In fact, we can keep doing this:  construct any positive sequence that converges to zero (but never attains it).  Now evaluate f at each element in that sequence, you will notice that the result becomes larger and larger.  We call the <i>limit</i> of this &#x27;infinity&#x27;, and we have notation for this.  Notice I did <i>NOT</i> evaluate f at zero, I merely studied what happens as I <i>approach</i> zero.  Infinity is <i>not</i> a real number, and I cannot have f ever evaluate to infinity, but I <i>can</i> talk about limiting properties.  Computers do this too, but they have a much lower standard for doing so.  Essentially, anything bigger than the maximum value of a double (about 10^300, I think?) is called &#x27;Inf&#x27; on a computer.<p>Edit:  I forgot to address the second paragraph of the parent comment.<p>>For example, it&#x27;s probably more sensible to say that 2x/x != 3x/x for all values of x, rather than 2x/x != 3x/x for all x except 0, wherein both functions are undefined and therefore equal to each other.<p>This is not a sensible thing to do.<p>Let me elaborate.  I&#x27;m going to ignore any cancellation issue and say it is definitely true that 2/x != 3/x for x != 0.  Let&#x27;s also say that each of these functions has domain (0, 1].  These two functions are not equal are x = 0 because you cannot evaluate them at x = 0.  It is forbidden.  However, behaviour <i>near</i> to zero is <i>very</i> similar.  See my discussion above.  In fact, you can make a stronger statement.  You can say that as x approaches zero (from the positive side), in the limit, 2/x and 3/x are equal.  That is, they have the same limit as you approach zero.  This does <i>not</i> make them equal at zero, because I cannot evaluate them at zero.  To make this point absolutely clear, I will add zero into the domain and define two different functions:<p>f:[0,1] -> R<p>f(x) = 2/x for x > 0<p>f(0) = 1<p>and<p>g:[0,1] -> R<p>g(x) = 3/x for x > 0<p>g(0) = 2<p>These functions have the same limit as you approach zero, but they are not equal at zero.  I <i>can</i> evaluate them at zero this time, because I defined what it meant to do so.  And indeed f(0) = 1 != 2 = g(0).",1400110024

7747036,comment,7744771,7746899,1,0,giovannibajo1,,,"I think it&#x27;s worse than that: DRM is serving a market of users ASKING to pay a lower price for renting movies instead of buying them. Many users are very happy to trade freedom of sharing with cost, and I personally don&#x27;t think you can expect a business model based on an agreement of sharing restrictions to work without any layer of technical enforcement.<p>Even outside of movies, there are surprisingly few examples of successful artificial restriction policies without any kind of  enforcement. Socially, people assume that they will be physically restricted from doing things that they are not supposed to be doing (from key locks to bank safes to packaging boxes with safety labels to bodyguards to keep out signs to whatever). I&#x27;m not sure it makes sense to go chicken/egg here: we can simply accept that people expect restriction policies to be enforced somehow, and they find totally reasonable that there is some kind of enforcement.<p>The whole business model of movies is based on restricted consumption; you pay more to get a better experience (e.g.: more quality) or less restrictions (e.g.: buy instead of rent). You can&#x27;t expect this to continue to exist without a technical enforcement, and at the same time you can&#x27;t expect Hollywood to come up with a radically different business model for a mature industry. You need disruption to arrive from somewhere else.<p>IMO, fighting against DRM for movies is ignoring the big picture. There are absolutely zero possibility that you will be able to experience Hollywood digital movies without DRM, because people accept and DEMAND to be restricted in order to access to discounts. The only alternative that makes sense is to boycott Hollywood and finance an innovator that can setup an alternative movie industry not based on restricted consumption (and good luck with coming up with a workable, scalable business model; that would easily make you billionaire and it&#x27;s thus quite hard to achieve).",1400108947

We then spent about 2 months adding new features and fixing bugs. Turned out, because of stupid sandboxing, we could no longer add any new features. Only bug fixes were accepted. Release got stalled for about 2 weeks trying to find a workaround. It was really depressing 2 weeks. Eventually we decided to release on our own. We notified our existing customers and gave heavy discounts for those who wanted to get the new version. Received few angry emails from our existing customers but most of them understood our problems. Other than that, it&#x27;s been going smooth. We are happy we did it. We don&#x27;t have to pay 30% to Apple (there is a little cost associated with licensing but it is just like 3% of the total cost). We now can release bug fixes as soon as we want.

You take the code of a browser that allows, but does not require, you to use a DRM system* and change it so that you are no longer able to install a DRM system. What&#x27;s the value proposition of the new browser? You won&#x27;t be tempted to install the DRM component when you find yourself wanting to view media that requires it? That seems pretty weak compared to the difficulty of maintaining a browser fork.<p>It seems to me that refusing to ship DRM makes sense if it gives leverage against the content companies, such that could be used to make them adopt DRM-free solutions. To get such leverage it would be necessary both that the reach of the unencumbered web was compelling and that requiring DRM would significantly limit that reach. Unfortunately plugins have historically provided a DRM-enabled way of distributing content via the web, so there was no compelling reason for content makers to forgo DRM in the past. This makes it significantly more difficult to change the industry today.<p>It is possible that there was a chance to win back some ground with the decline of plugins on mobile. However, it&#x27;s also possible that the prevalence of native apps on those platforms made the web itself a less appealing medium for distributing content to mobile users. In any case, the eagerness of Microsoft and Google to deploy in-browser DRM means that we didn&#x27;t get to run that experiment. Instead we are in a situation where some high percentage of web users can get DRM encumbered video content in their current browser. For those who can&#x27;t the barrier to switching browsers is typically rather small. Not shipping the capability to view DRMed video in this situation is, tragically, trying to hold a non-equilibrium position; it might be principled but it is going to end in a significantly sub-optimal outcome.<p>I suppose the optimistic view is that video will follow the iTunes model and DRM will be a short term burden that we have to bear until technology and attitudes in the industry make it clear that there&#x27;s a better way. I&#x27;m confident that Mozilla will continue to push to find  that better way.<p>* Assuming one that exists that is compatible with your OS + hardware + etc.; all the usual problems of binary blobs in general and DRM in particular still apply, of course.",1400108476

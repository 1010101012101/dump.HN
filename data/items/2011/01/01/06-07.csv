2057331,comment,2057073,2057303,0,0,Xuzz,,,"My question was more of if you have multiple statements, instead of a single expression, you wanted to stick inside a macro and preserve the ability to call it within another expression.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  #define SOMEMACRO(x) do { \\n     int y=0;               \\n     for(int i=0; i<x; i++) \\n       y=dosomething(y, i); \\n  } while (0)\n</code></pre>\nWhich, of course, works fine if you call it as a statement. But it doesn't work if you want to somehow ""return"" the value of ""y"" from that: there's no way to embed that kind of loop into an expression.<p>He showed an example of using Apple's Blocks to solve that, can you do the same with C++0x lambdas?",1293864739

Not to mention these sorts of things tend to already be in a box in my closet, practically packed and ready to go.<p>Aside from the negligible space they take up, they certainly aren't having a negative effect on my everyday life, so removing them would have no tangible benefit. In fact, their loss would deprive me of the artifacts of what's been a fairly interesting life so far. Any bulky items (eg small appliances, furniture) that would create any sort of hassle have already been given away to friends who would find them useful.<p>But I'm not sufficiently self-absorbed to call this a 'movement'. In the words of BSNYC^, it's just a matter of categorizing my things under 'Shit I Need' and 'Shit I Play With'.

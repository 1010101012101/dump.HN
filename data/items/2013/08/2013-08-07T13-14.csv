I pay a lot of attention to the wickedness of Russian politics, and, quite frankly, LBGTQ are right there at the very edge of Russian political struggle, being one of the very few groups whose very survival demands liberty (others may get by through kowtowing to the political powers, but they don&#x27;t have that option). They are hated by an overwhelming majority of Russians in the province (same majority that keeps voting Putin into power), because of all the fear, lies and propaganda spread by the state.

Most of the hard work (both resource-wise and legal) has been done for you or is easy to do.

Even if you aren&#x27;t a technologist, you will likely be impacted by technology whether you want to be or not, because it structures a large amount of daily life, at least unless you are a hermit in the mountains. From that perspective, it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for everyone to have opinions on technology. Unfortunately, as with politics, the opinions not based on any kind of understanding of how things work tend not to be as useful in figuring out how to improve them.<p>Ted Nelson&#x27;s version of it [1] is something like: technology is too important to be left up to the techies, but if nobody but techies understands technology at all, it will by default be left up to them, because nobody else will be able to say anything sensible about it. Therefore regular people need to learn at least something about technology, enough to analyze it intelligently and make decisions for themselves.

- It is homoiconic like Lisp and thus allows for fantastic macro facilities [2]<p>- It has solid parallel programming support via a Coroutines implementation (Tasks) (similar to Goroutines as far as I can tell)<p>- It is a non-pure functional language<p>- In contrast to Go it has generics, so functional constructs like map, apply, drop, reduce, fold, partition & friends are already in there (or can easily be implemented) [3]<p>- It has optional types, so that you <i>can</i> assign types and the compiler will check for it and mark errors and will be able to create optimised code, but you don&#x27;t have to [4]<p>- Running external programs is a joy [5]  (Example: a=readall(`echo hello`))<p>The community seems to be very alive.

It would do this <i>each time</i> it saved a password. It does not do this because you would be less likely to trust Chrome with your passwords if it did that.<p>So Chrome wants you to feel secure and give you convenience. Either it makes some attempt to prevent casual password access or it informs you that your passwords are casually available. It can&#x27;t have it both ways.<p>I agree that the user would be better off having the vulnerability rubbed in their face but Chrome does not do that.<p>Edit: You also need to take into account <i>intent</i> and the <i>emotion</i> of the user accessing the passwords. The system currently implemented in Chrome makes it easy to peek at someone&#x27;s passwords without malicious intent. If you simply had to overcome some hurdles it would make most people stop and think about what they are doing because it is a breach of trust. We&#x27;re not talking about stopping determined attackers.<p>Edit 2: Also, I presume that specific environment because it is the environment I work and live in every day.

6172579,comment,6171836,6171836,38,0,w_t_payne,,,"Michael Hayden is being provocative -- attempting to provoke debate. This is an excellent, laudable act, and should be warmly welcomed.<p>So, here is my response:-<p>There is an element of truth to what Michael Hayden is saying, although his analysis of the situation is enormously telling, and reveals a lot about the culture that prevails in the corridors of power.<p>It is true that the internet is creating communities and groups that do not fit into the old hierarchies of power and control. New communications technologies forge new arenas of discourse; they bring together new communities and interest groups, largely unconstrained by geography, culture, religion or (increasingly) language. These groups are beginning to find common cause, recognize their political power, and flex their (political) muscles.<p>It is natural and proper that those who benefit from the status-quo should feel nervous. This technological watershed (and the movement of movements that it has triggered) does indeed pose an existential threat to many organisations that predicate their existence on the primacy and sovereignty of the Nation State.<p>To labor the point: Notions of sovereignty and the plenipotentiary power of the state are weakened and undermined when individuals discover that their shared humanity cuts across international boundaries, and that the &quot;tribe&quot; to which they pledge allegiance is neither best defined nor best constrained in terms of militarily defensible contiguous geographical regions.<p>So, political and economic elites that are strongly aligned with the interests and primacy of the nation state really do face an existential threat, albeit a distributed, generally non-violent, tides-of-history type threat, rather than one that is focused around a particular &quot;enemy&quot; posing a specific and identifiable physical threat.<p>As I mentioned previously, Hayden&#x27;s response to this threat is telling, and reveals much about his (and the Agency&#x27;s) predispositions and cognitive biases.<p>Firstly, he thinks immediately of a physical threat - of hostile groups seeking revenge. He sees the world in terms of &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;enemies&quot;, in terms of coherent and organised groups that can be treated as atomic units, and imbued with anthropomorphic characteristics: &quot;anger&quot;, &quot;revenge&quot; and so on.<p>Secondly, he seeks to (at the same time) elevate and exaggerate the threat posed by this (notional) group, to make it relevant to the political mainstream, by speculating about attacks on civilian infrastructure - exactly what he would have needed to do during the inevitable internecine budgetary battles that he would have fought during his tenure with the NSA. As a former department head, this is necessarily his area of expertise, and the home turf on which he feels most comfortable.<p>This second aspect is particularly dangerous in that he seeks to incite and provoke the very threat that he spends so much effort warning us about. He ruthlessly exploits our tribalistic, pack-animal ancestry, conjuring up hostile groups where none exist; engineering conflict in a callous game of divide-and-conquer.<p>So, we have two threads in his speculation:-<p>The latter thread being part of a persistent and habitual strategy of scaremongering and conflict creation -- the better to secure a bigger slice of the budgetary pie for &quot;the boys&quot;, is rather more transparent (and consequentially less interesting) than the former - the expectation that his foes will always form coherent and organised groups, capable of &quot;making demands&quot;, and of acting in a manner amenable to anthropomorphic analysis. This contrasts rather well with one competing view -- that sees the world as a collection of ad-hoc networks of ideas and social mechanisms, some forming, others dissolving -- clearly structured, but not at all hierarchical.",1375881503

One of the criticisms levied upon Alibaba is that there is no way of knowing which of the suppliers can be trusted and which are not even close to being set up to carry out the services they are advertising. How does one best approach the problem of due diligence when using Alibaba?<p>Most product pages I have seen on Alibaba are confusing. It&#x27;s not clear what the product is, what the price is including shipping, and what the end-to-end process for me will be including how defects and returns are dealt with. What strategy do you recommend for approaching this problem?<p>One product I searched for was custom playing cards. I was thinking of ordering 100k decks or so, with a custom design printed on the front and back of each card. A lot of suppliers on Alibaba are listed in this niche. So I thought, great, I have a custom request -- I want to design the front as well as the back -- so I should be able to do a request for quote and send it to all of them, right? Wrong, there is no standard form I can send out to all of them, I have to contact each of them individually. I also wanted to know how much it would cost just to buy the cardboard boxes that playing cards come in, but again it seemed I would have to contact each supplier separately which struck me as a suboptimal process. Any thoughts on that, I would love to hear.<p>Also I would like to know how samples work. If I request a sample of something relatively expensive, does the supplier eat the cost of the item or do I have to pay for it? I assume I have to pay for the shipping. Are there any ways within Alibaba that I can fill out one form and get a bunch of samples sent to me, or is this something that I have to set up supplier by supplier?<p>Which product categories offer the best savings versus what would be available in, let&#x27;s say, the United States?<p>What tips can you share on shipping?<p>I have read that Alibaba is not the best website for outsourcing manufacturing to China. However I have not come across strong viable alternatives. What are your thoughts on the competition? Specifically it would be helpful to know if there is anywhere online that you know of where suppliers are vetted for legitimacy and integrity, as these are routinely cited in forums as problems for Alibaba.<p>I signed up for your crash course.

No more waiting after a night out for a safe ride home, and no more trusting your car&#x27;s security with parking attendants on side streets.<p>Please keep in mind that during Uber&#x27;s &quot;secret testing phase&quot;, availability may be limited as we perfect the experience. We&#x27;re working hard to make additional Ubers available every day.<p>As we build our own team in Johannesburg, we&#x27;re also looking to hire a brilliant Community Manager - someone to lead marketing and be the face of Uber in Jozi. Know anyone brilliant? Let us know and we&#x27;ll make it rain Uber credits your way.<p>Keep us posted with any feedback at supportjoburg@uber.com and follow @uber_joburg for the latest news, promotions and updates.<p>Much Love,<p>Team #UberAfrica</i>",1375880719

6172469,comment,6171514,6172159,4,0,rismay,,,"@tsycho is right. I want to provide a little more &quot;context&quot; to this comment. This is hacker news after all.<p>As an aside and shout out: 
@willvarfar&#x27;s demo reminds me of Jer Thorp&#x27;s talk from a TedX a couple of years back: <a href=""http://youtu.be/Q9wcvFkWpsM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/Q9wcvFkWpsM</a><p>Background: I have some experience with iOS location APIs too. My concept was called wrkstrm (Here is a quick 1.5 minute demo I made for the AngelHack 2012 summer finals: <a href=""http://youtu.be/U0adNGyXsuE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/U0adNGyXsuE</a>)<p>Apple has been refining CoreLocation almost every year since iOS 2 with a focus to battery life. A huge addition came in iOS 5 which introduced the API changes that @tsycho mentioned - significant location monitoring and geo fencing. Again, @tsycho was astute to note that this information was ALREADY being logged by the phone and provided to telcos (there was a huge scare about this a couple of years ago). All Apple did was give developers access to this data without having to hack (check out @willvarfar&#x27;s demo and OpenPaths). Another aside: These two APIs are what prompted me to learn how to code. I was seriously disappointed when I found out that Apple was &quot;cheating&quot; the implementation of these APIs. The resolution to these APIs is crap - something like football fields of disparity. This is what started my journey into finding a more accurate way to geo fence and track locations.<p>The screenshots @ladino linked to use a different approach to generate. This information is NEW. Also it was made possible by two sensor driven user interface innovations which seem totally irrelevant. First, in iOS 6 Apple started running the accelerometer all day with it&#x27;s raise to speak to Siri feature - (simply put the phone to your ear to activate Siri). Now with iOS 7, Apple has introduced a &quot;constant on&quot; gyroscope, with the introduction of the Parallax effect. Now Apple can (for FREE) measure &quot;stay&quot; events when the iPhone is not moving (using signal processing) without necessarily resorting to expensive / inaccurate geo fencing. That is what provides the new location data @tsycho showed. Why am I so sure that this is what Apple is doing? Apple was originally planning to go even further by providing step count data (similar to the Galaxy S4&#x27;s S Health data) to developers. This is only possible by running the aforementioned sensors and using signal processing. This was shown in the new iOS 7 technologies during the keynote and even in the iOS 7 beta 1 documentation, but all mentions were abruptly removed with beta 2 and beyond. Look for this is iOS 7.1 or iOS 8.<p>If you are interested I&#x27;ve decided to elaborate on this post over at my nascent blog:<p><a href=""http://wrkstrm.postach.io/post/core-location-evolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wrkstrm.postach.io/post/core-location-evolution</a>",1375880429

They’re building these in the jungles.'<p>While I'm not pro-drug-trade, some of the legal tactics seem problematic:  'The Drug Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Assistance Act, which became law in October, now allows the United States to prosecute someone for merely being on board a semisub. ... Such a law does not exist in Colombia. But Colombia’s defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, told me that one is in the works and could be enacted as early as June. He said the country is also looking to ban certain plastics used in semisub production.'<p>Illegal to be on board a boat because of its design?  Banning plastics because the might be used for submarine manufacture?  This seems clumsy and parallel to laws regarding technology issues such as deCSS and file sharing.",1240678709

579011,comment,578755,578993,0,0,bonaldi,,,"<i>I fail to see a massive difference beyond extraordinary lazyness there.</i><p>""Laziness"" is a key component of usability -- nearly all efficiency improvements can be dismissed as ""just for the lazy"", well back before the dawn of computers. Who needs an electronic starter for their car anyway? Surely a crank handle is fine?<p><i>I'm condemning it because it's a step backwards not forwards and affects me, as I have to deal not only with the outlook TOFU idiots but also with the gmail TOFU idiots now. Google of all companies should know better, but ""fancy"" won over ""sensible"" one more time.</i><p>It shouldn't affect you at all -- you can carry on plodding through your messages one by one in your client, and shaking your fist at TOFU from your porch recliner. But the TOFU battle is (sadly) lost, thanks to Outlook and later Gmail. Increasing client usability isn't going to affect that fight one jot.<p><i>Engineers tend to also be the most extensive users of e-mail. Most mailing lists happen between technical people. Many E-Mail Clients are under active development. If conversation views were considered a worthwhile feature then we'd be having it everywhere by now. The implementation effort is minimal.</i><p>And yet when you view a Bugzilla thread on the web, you see all the replies in a single page. I agree that if conversation views were considered a worthwhile feature <i>by engineers</i> we'd be seeing it everywhere by now. But this is simply proving to be another case where the use case of the vast majority of engineers is wildly different to the end-user case. Google Groups, as you pointed out above, is also incredibly popular among technical people. You can't see a reason why (though you'll doubtless have something condescending to mention about youth or branding) because you refuse to accept that it may be popular for a reason.<p><i>Most MUAs are already tracking ""conversations"" as you call them and have done so for 20 years.</i><p>No, no they aren't, as you'd see if you deigned to take the time to consider what a conversation actually is, an understanding you simply don't have as evidenced by your screenshot above. It's not a dumb subject-based sort, nor is simply header-based or a combination of the two. <i>Crucially</i>, it includes messages sent by the reader -- which is where the work is for the client: it has to sort through the <i>entire</i> local sent archive to render the conversation. Can you name a single client that has done this for 20 years?<p>Clearly, this a love-hate feature. For the haters, there is ... ooh, every mail client ever. For those who love it, there is, well, GMail. Something's amiss there, especially when adding the feature would barely impact on haters.",1240677601

If you dropped the social security tax on the employer side, wages would rise (the employer doesn't care whether the money goes to the government or the employee). It's effectively an income tax. The accounting is slightly different, but that's just the name we give it.

You don't know, because your client allows you to read a message a time. Gmail lets you read a conversation at a time. Massive difference.</i><p>I fail to see a massive difference beyond extraordinary lazyness there.<p>I don't normally <i>want</i> to see a full thread at a time. It can make sense in a web-frontend where page refreshes take annoyingly long, but other than that I see more drawbacks than benefits in my workflow.<p><i>What I mean is that the atom of the mail client is an entire conversation. So when I move it to another folder (or label it in Gmail parlance) all the related messages get grouped, or flagged or whatever.</i><p>Again, that's nice but no difference to desktop mail clients.<p><i>There's nothing about conversations that prevents this. Look at Hacker News: it has both all-posts-on-a-page and nesting. Would you prefer that the comments view was just a list of timestamps and poster names and you had to individually click each one to see the comment? No? Yet that's what most mailing list clients and archives make you do.</i><p>You said ""No"" where I say ""Yes"". I have no problem pressing a single key between reading comments. I like seeing which comments I have already read. I like seeing which comments I have replied to. I like to flag comments that I might want to come back to later. I like archieving stuff, arranging it in folders or forwarding it by e-mail. I like attachments. Yes, I love all the features that have evolved in online discussion over the last two decades and would prefer if HN was a mailing list or newsgroup.<p>Unfortunately that's not mass compatible because most kids these days have unlearned what a newsreader is. Hence we are stuck with the poor substitute of a web forum (and not a particularly good one, as even PG will probably admit, <i>unknown or expired link</i>, eh?).<p><i>I'm not sure why you're so quick to condemn something that would be such a massive leap in usability for so many email users and that doesn't exclude your preferred method of operation.</i><p>I'm condemning it because it's a step <i>backwards</i> not forwards and affects me, as I have to deal not only with the outlook TOFU idiots but also with the gmail TOFU idiots now. Google of all companies should know better, but ""fancy"" won over ""sensible"" one more time.<p><i>But I want more. I actually wonder if the prevalence of mailing list-centric attitudes like yours among engineers is the reason we don't have mail clients with proper conversations yet.</i><p>It's called ""clue"". Engineers tend to also be the most extensive users of e-mail. Most mailing lists happen between technical people. Many E-Mail Clients are under active development. If conversation views were considered a worthwhile feature then we'd be having it everywhere by now. The implementation effort is minimal.<p><i>I actually suspect that it's still simply too hard: you have to sort and search potentially tens of thousands of messages just to display one conversation, and the easier route is just to make the human do the work. But I'd far rather my (or Google's) computer did it for me.</i><p>That's nonsense. Most MUAs are already tracking ""conversations"" as you call them and have done so for 20 years. It's just that most haven't bothered to <i>display</i> the threads in a ""conversation view"" way, because most heavy e-mail users [that I know of] don't find that view particularly useful.",1240676432

Even if they did, there's edge cases where the user fills 95% of the disk and the OS has to page with the remaining 5% (this would require a very intelligent wear levelling algorithm that could optimistically move in-use blocks)",1270896917
1254843,comment,1253621,1254448,0,0,tjogin,,,"That sounds very reasonable — with third party development environment like that of CS5, that would be expected.<p>But how could it detect, say, various libraries that would pre-compile to C/Objective-C — <i>not</i> using a third party development environment with separate libraries like CS5, just direct <i>other language</i>-to-Apple's-environment compilers, like that of Apple's own MacRuby (sort of).<p>I think what Apple want is for us to use their environment, their libraries, Cocoa Touch and all that. They don't want cross-platform ""shovelware"" they want apps to be uniquely designed for the iPhone. That's the key. I don't think they really care if the code was written in, say, Ruby or Clojure, using a compiler designed specifically to target <i>Apple's</i> specific libraries. Could they even detect something like that?<p>I even <i>expect</i> Apple to try to get MacRuby, and similar tools for other languages, working with Mac and iPhone development. It's the generality of cross-compiled generic shovelware they don't like. Not ""other"" languages.<p>Think about it: which do you think Apple likes more: cross-platform apps developed ""originally"" in C using Eclipse (no Apple-libraries) and released for every mobile platform under the sun. Or, apps uniquely designed and developed for iPhone using MacRuby with Cocoa Touch (whenever that's technically possible).",1270896785

1254836,comment,1254633,1254734,0,0,statictype,,,">ou do realize that Windows Mobile 7 has similar policies as the iPhone. Apps need to be written in Silverlight (a Flash competitor), XNA (games), or .NET. I'm not sure if Adobe can manage yet another cross-compiler (if that's how CS5 works).<p>You're confusing two different types of restrictions.<p>The restriction on using silverlight/.net stems from the how the platform was designed.<p>If you were to write, say, a compiler that takes O'Caml code and spits out .NET IL instructions, then you could use that to write your apps.<p>Apple is saying you have to use whatever higher level languages they approve of regardless of what the final binaries look like.",1270895717

Think about when that one second would occur: when the app you are using needs more memory, you are running low, and the system is closing the least recently used app. Right at that moment is the worst time, user experience wise, to have a delay, especially a delay on the order of half to one second.",1270895390

1254832,comment,1254601,1254754,0,0,oakenshield,,,"It's not that cryptography has failed; it's more that the web-using public is largely ignorant and unaware what security or cryptography means. They think in real-life analogues: a random person on the street hears me talking to my friend outside my house about my weekend plans. Not a big deal, because (1) that random person didn't hear every single word, (2) we'd see if they were eavesdropping too closely, and (3) no human can remember every last detail of speech they hear. Unfortunately, an eavesdropper on the wire can do all this and more, but people don't seem to understand.<p>I think the right way to go is for providers make strong cryptography standard (like your Adium example). The current GPG usage model and its integration with email is poorly executed, and most of the web-using public won't care to learn how it works let alone create key pairs. The only thing the public at large can understand is secrecy of social communication. I await the day Facebook or Google start automatically generating and managing keys, and encrypting communication between users based on their social connections.",1270895287

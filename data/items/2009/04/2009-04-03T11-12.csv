A fully automated robotic laboratory can design its own molecular biology experiments and has even made its first discoveries, a multidisciplinary team reports this week.

If anybody has a ""desire to have a large family gene"", then that gene will come to dominate the human gene pool in a few hundred generations, because people with it will produce, on average, many times as many children as people without it.  The two biggest assumptions here are:<p>1. This gene exists (and is the main factor in determining how many children people have.)<p>2. Other genes won't become more important.<p>I would bet on both of these assumptions being false, but it's certainly possible that they hold.",1238756674

Rand called one of her books _The Virtue of Selfishness_, apparently either as a marketing idea or just to get a rise out of people (she seemed to enjoy controversy). ""Self-actualization"" is more new-agey, and she would probably have disliked it, but it's clear from her writing that that's exactly what she meant.",1238756435

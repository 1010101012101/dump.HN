Look at Medicare spending or even VA hospitals.  You would think that they would first want to fix what they should be doing right in the first place before trying to ""fix"" even parts of the system that aren't broken (they spend almost as much as Canadians do on a per capita basis on public healthcare on Medicare).<p>As for these problems you speak of.  As an example I just tried to book a physical - the earliest possible appointment?  March 10th!  Another friend of mine needed to book an initial consult with another medical specialist and their first appointment is almost 17 months away.  Sorry, I don't get how such a large percentage of Canadians seem not to understand how poorly our system works and how much better it could and how they are so ideologically opposed to the idea of at least having private options.  It's not the rich who are inconvenienced since they just go down to the US and pay, but it's the middle class who are legally prevented from using private providers in Canada so we're stuck to wait.",1253764298

840567,comment,840523,840546,0,0,jerf,,,"The Kolmogorov complexity of COM is, at the very least, hundreds of kilobytes of itchy, fidgety, sensitive, and complicated code. The Kolmogorov complexity of xor'ing two pointers to save 32 bits is on the order of tens or hundreds of bytes. (I'm using the term a bit loosely, obviously, but I think it gets the point across.) I suppose it depends on the limit of ""slightly"", but in context I think it's clear we're talking about ""techniques"" that are more than a three line hack in your linked list library. YMMV. (That is, I do see the point you are trying to make.)<p>Presumably, the duct tape programmer is doing that because it is the difference between making the product go and not making the product go, not because they love bit packing. It's not a technique I'd adopt today, but Zawinski (just to choose one example from his repertoire I've read about) was trying to make machines with, say, 8MB of RAM able to read thousands of email messages. You get a bit nutty under those constraints, or you ship slow crap. There isn't much of a third choice. (Fast and featureless, maybe.)<p>(I <i>think</i> I can bid lower than 8MB of RAM, too, but I'm a bit fuzzy on netscape timeframes vs. ram timeframes. I think 4.0 was in the 32-64-128MB era, putting 3.0 a ways back, but I'm not sure.)",1253763496

840565,comment,839830,840470,0,0,tiffani,,,"Nope, not pissed off at all.  What can we do, though?<p>- Change attitudes of kids.  We can't continue on this trend where being smart is considered ""acting white.""  Surprisingly, I never got much of that back in grade school because for some reason or another being smart was respectable (and no, I've never been to a private school).  That's always been weird in seeing it, though, because I've seen it in <i>little</i> kids.  What the heck is a 7 year old supposed to know about ""acting white""?  In that same vein, we should talk about parents (that kind of thought process had to start somewhere).<p>- Change attitudes of parents.  A lot of parents need to be more involved.  I've seen parents who didn't do so much as to even make sure their kid did his/her homework because the parent didn't know how to do it (among other reasons that are less easy to alleviate such as work schedules).  The kids at the elementary school that day confirmed it.  There's a big difference between knowing how to do your kid's homework and making sure they at least attempt it.  No, my parents had no clue how to do my calculus homework when I was in high school, but they made sure I was doing it, though.<p>- Make mincemeat of self-fulfilling prophecies.  I think a lot of what happens with black kids and other minorities (some friends have been walking examples of this) is more of a cyclic self-fulfilling prophecy kind of thing.  Nobody around you is doing all that well, nobody around you is really perceived as being all that smart, and so hey, why try to prove anybody wrong?  Yes, as crazy as that sounds, years ago I could have listed numerous people who had that exact self-defeating attitude.  Obviously, that's not the case for everybody, but it's an attitude more common than a lot of people like to acknowledge.  :(<p>In mentioning the self-fulfilling prophecy idea, that means you' d have to get parents more interested in what their kids were doing at school (and immediately afterschool in a lot of instances); teachers who don't give up easily on minority students (or any student for that matter); and finally, minority students who see education less as a burden of some sort and more of a ticket to a better standard of living.<p>- Flat out expect more.  Indeed this does go the @wsprague route, but there's a ring of truth to what s/he is saying.  I look at what Steve Perry up in Connecticut is doing.  (<a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/07/22/bia.education.success/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/07/22/bia.education.success/i...</a>)  He expects more out of his students (and teachers) and they rise to the occasion.  The school has a ""near-zero dropout rate"" and all the graduates go to college.  I don't have any stats on what they end up majoring in, but at least they're set up to go to college.<p>- Show kids they have options, keep kids informed of them, and encourage them to pursue them.  The article with Steve Perry mentions it and I saw it firsthand in high school--minority students getting shuffled into less demanding classes (no AP!) thanks to stereotypes and not having the wherewithal to set themselves up for a more demanding schedule.  A lot of kids don't know about the kinds of classes that would set them up to go to college and pursue anything of rigor.  Having a guidance counselor offer you a culinary arts course instead of an AP Biology course makes a big difference if you don't know what you could be missing by not taking that AP class.<p>- Educational parity.   I witnessed my calculus teacher from high school leave my high school for a more affluent high school.  Yes, she has more students at that high school, but if you've got a brain drain on a school level, you're going to have it at some point on a county then state then national level.  If all the great teachers are clustered at certain schools (and school systems <i>allow</i> this), what happens to the other schools?<p>I seriously don't have all the answers, but changing the attitudes (about a lot of things) of parents, teachers, and students seems to be a big part of it all.  If I'd had a crappy attitude about anything I'd encountered intellectually for the last 5-10 years, I doubt I'd be <i>here</i>.",1253763434

840555,comment,839675,840448,0,0,mkyc,,,"My point is that naming verbosity depends on the code. This is vague but better than saying ""cf. Goldilocks"" (""choose anything between two crazy extremes""). My other point is that everyday use of names should be a guide for naming in code. The <i>reason</i> Mama Bear is wrong is that she's too formal. She gives a full explanation of the variable each time, but the 'full explanation' is the responsibility of the var setters, not of the name.<p>Your Momma Bear either misses the last days of several months, or counts extra days. It also fails to count the LastMonthOfYear. Your Baby Bear is nothing like your Momma Bear, though you seem to be refactoring. Momma counts entire months (look at the variable names, last day <i>of month</i>), Baby does something like ""sum the totals from the first five days of Feb-May"". These are naming bugs, they aren't irrelevant.<p>The naming depends on the code. If we're iterating a 3d array and the vars are set directly above, Papa Bear is readable and I wouldn't dick around with it (it might be a convention in the codebase).<p><pre><code>  // baby bear\n  for(y=firstY; y<=lastY; y++)\n    for(m=firstM; m<=lastM; m++)\n      for(d=firstD; d<=lastD; d++)\n        sum += getDailyTotals(y,m,d); // line 4\n</code></pre>\nI'm not writing tutorials here. If you don't understand y, m, d in lines 1-3 (especially having seen line 4), you probably haven't been working with dates enough to be messing with this code anyway.<p>I'm not saying you should choose single variable names, I'm saying they're sometimes ok, and that it's not as simple as ""choose names with 4-8 characters"".",1253762712

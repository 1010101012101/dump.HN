Once I ditched the apartment/car payment, I found that I could live substantially cheaper on the road than I could back home.<p>As an example, living and climbing on the beach in Thailand, I could pay for my monthly rent/food/beer expenses with a <i>single day</i> of billable work.  I had a laptop along for exactly that purpose, and as a result I ended up padding out the savings quite a bit by living in a tin shack on the beach.<p>You think travel is expensive because <i>vacations</i> are expensive and that's your only experience with travelling.  A week in Hawaii costs about $10k for your family all in, so naturally it must cost me ~$500k a year on the road, right?  I'll leave it to you to do the math on what you actually end up spending when you're paying local rates for accommodation and travel in 3rd world countries, but the answer you're working toward is $500-$1000/month.",1311080257

One advantage with slower machines is that benchmarking becomes easier, such that any slow operations are really obvious at the development stage.  The other advantage is that customers are also often using similarly aged hardware.  Older hardware forces you to make your algorithms efficient, rather than relying upon faster machines to hide the bloat.<p>In my case I was also often developing for embedded target hardware which was a good deal slower than a typical PC, so older PCs were more realistic for testing.<p>The advantage of always being on the latest hardware is if you're developing large software systems which take a long time to compile, or if you're doing something which fundamentally requires significant number crunching - such as games or computational chemistry.",1311079113

Hardware is not my bottleneck.<p>Of course, this has more to do with my other preferences. I like keeping my toolchain as light as possible. I don't use bloated IDEs, even when working with languages that require an IDE, such as Java. I don't do heavy processing often and when I do, I prefer offloading that work on AWS. I am also proficient with manipulating virtual desktops.<p>As far as startups go, I think that spending money on expensive hardware is not frugal spending. If you're my boss, I would rather prefer a bonus than the latest and shiniest crap -- if I want shiny crap, I can buy it myself while respecting my own priorities.",1311077746

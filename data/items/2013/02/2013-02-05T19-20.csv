Why I No Get My Act Together?!?!?<p>I have tried to teach myself to code since 2007. I started my first profitable web company at age 20 without being able to afford a computer, but had to pay someone to code it up for me. Why I No Get My Act Together?!?!?<p>I know that I am not a lead developer or even close, but I am learning the fundamentals and am able to build my own prototypes without bugging someone to be my co-founder. Now I can show them even if the prototype is sh*tty (read: less then great).<p>I am now going through the Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl: <a href=""http://ruby.railstutorial.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/</a> after going through: <a href=""https://teamtreehouse.com/subscribe/plans?referrer=jameshighsmith"" rel=""nofollow"">https://teamtreehouse.com/subscribe/plans?referrer=jameshigh...</a> and have even played around with changing my terminal: <a href=""http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/how-to-customize-your-command-prompt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/how-to-cust...</a>

Initially I pointed him to some of the specific projects he worked on and guided him through setting up things like dummy apps and running tests and then let him do a couple of things (like adding documentation or tests) on his own so he can explore the codebase.<p>Afterwards, we started pairing on smaller things like bug fixes where I took the lead and basically just talked about what I was doing.<p>After all that, I started assigning him some of these smaller projects on his own and just checked in now and again when he had a process question. From there, it the ramp up just kind of naturally happens on its own as the dev gets more and more engaged in the project.",1360094351

I decided to follow up and they offered $80/mo which was still expensive but less than the ticket price. I said I'd subscribe at that price but had to wait because we were having an issue with their gem when used with Turbolinks.<p>Regardless, they switched my account to the paid plan right away. I then got at least one email a day asking me to put in my credit card number, despite the issue with Turbolinks. They were so damn annoying trying to get my credit card number that I told them to forget it, to revert my account back to the free plan and that I'll revisit once they fixed the issue and we had more time to deal with it. That's when the had the audacity to say that I needed to pay a 3 month penalty since I was canceling a yearly agreement. Something I never agreed to in the first place.

5172878,comment,5172278,5172278,6,0,codex,,,"Contrast Tesla's from-scratch, top-down strategy with those of some existing car manufacturers, which is to add electric motors and batteries incrementally to existing car platforms, which leverage their huge economies of scale: existing plants and parts can be reused.<p>The same plants which make a million gas-powered Honda Accords per year can be used to make an incremental 100,000 electrics, then 200,000 a year later, then 500,000, as sales grow and technology matures.  Ford is using this strategy to great effect with their Focus and C-MAX EVs which are fairly affordable and accessible to the average consumer.<p>The question is whether electric technology is so revolutionary as to require a complete redesign of the car, (e.g. body panels and frame) in which case Tesla's approach may win out.

The storage battery on the Tesla Roadster weighs 990 pounds, stores 56 kWh (about 202 MJ) and discharges in 244 miles (393 km) in normal conditions (vehicle speed and environmental temperature). This is a stellar example of applied science and engineering (it's much better performance than that of similar batteries) but it still represents a big obstacle to wide adoption of electric vehicle technology.<p>As a seasoned former NASA engineer who struggled with these same issues on spacecraft for years, I offer this advice: young people who are trying to decide what do with their lives should seriously consider a career in battery science and engineering.

5172662,comment,5170535,5171977,3,0,rdtsc,,,"> For that you need Erlang<p>Because the other side of highly concurrent applications is increase complexity. Both threads and async-based _large_ applications become a mess, fast. No talking about HAProxy type small server, but complicated business rules, state machines and so on. Shared state is hard to reason in non-concurrent application, large concurrent ones, especially with shared data structures, become complicated.<p>That is why light-weight isolated process based concurrency is the best IMHO. Erlang is at the for-front of that. It also has a completely concurrent garbage collector (it won't stop the world) since each process also has a  private heap. But as the infomercial guy says, ""But wait, that's not all"". Add hot code reloading and being able to schedule all these light-weight processes on any number of CPU in an m:n fashion is what takes the cake.<p>Aha, so is it all rainbows and unicorns. No. You pay for it by getting a sequential slow down. So if you benchmark mandelbrot or matrix multiplication on C++ vs Erlang, C++ will win. Safety and isolation doesn't come for free. So pick and choose based on what requirements you have. There is the syntax issue that people don't like so those are some trade-offs.",1360092359

The notable exception was the proposed AT&T/T-Mobile merger, which, ironically, probably would have actually helped improve technology and push down prices because both of those carriers are moving into the prepaid/pay as you go space aggressively.  Unfortunately, both also use GSM band technology...<p>With respect to unlocking, however, I can't fathom why the device manufacturers, particularly Google/Motorola Mobility, don't play the adults here.  They have more to gain from impressing the end-consumer than making time with carriers.  It has to be more expensive for manufacturers to create several different versions of the same device for different carriers.  In many cases, these are all but different devices - not the same radios, not the same functions, often not even the same processors.  If these manufacturers made their flagship devices with both CDMA and GSM radios operating on all common bands (deactivated or not, as need may be), they would benefit from economies of scale, lowering their costs and allowing the devices to sell, unlocked, at lower costs.  This would make sales directly to end-consumers more realistic, which would FORCE the carriers to improve their service, in order to bring people into their no longer walled gardens.  That would force improvements in speed, price, and quality.<p>Right now, I guess, manufacturers benefit from advertising done by the carriers, but they also suffer from the walled garden and loss of economies of scale.  I have no way of knowing which is worth more to them, but we have yet to see a true, universal, unlocked device from a carrier.  We can tweak world CDMA phones to ""work"" on GSM networks, but not too well so far.",1360091926

Linus points out in one of the later emails that instruction fetching and decoding ends up being the major bottleneck on high-performance code, especially when the architecture contains optimizations like out of order execution.  Higher compression means more cycles to decompress, and you still need cache space to store and cache the decoded instructions, so you don't get multiple hits for running the same instructions in a loop.<p>The additional prefetch hit can certainly be mitigated by additional pipelining, but it's still more silicon every instruction needs to go through.<p>Realistically, I think the best approach may be more RAM and larger onboard caches.",1360091779

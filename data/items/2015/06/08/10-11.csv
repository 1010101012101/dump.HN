9678209,comment,9677306,9677306,0,0,hamstergene,,,"As GUI dev who worked with Apple&#x27;s AutoLayout extensively I can confidently say constraint-based layout is a trap. It looks like more intuitive way to go on simple examples, but complexity spikes quickly as number of controls goes up. It&#x27;s more complicated, more resilient to changes (harder to maintain), easy to get wrong, hard to understand and debug, bugs generally look uglier (what would be minor misplacement in CSS often becomes overlapping or clipping). It does not support word wrapping without hacks and restrictive assumptions about width. It is a real mess to insert/remove controls dynamically.<p>Compared to previous experience with Qt, I don&#x27;t see any advantage of constraint-based layout over box-based layout.",1433761100

9678199,comment,9671922,9674343,0,0,jacobolus,,,"He asked for a replacement for Times that would be appropriate in a technical paper with support for LaTeX formulae, while taking up less horizontal space than Times at the same point size. The goal here isn’t to be unique or prove that we’re typographically trendy, but to look good, be legible, and fit the requirements.<p>The main problem I have with Times isn’t that it’s overused, but more that it’s inappropriate for many contexts, and the specific implementations of Times are often bad. If you want to use Times at 8 pt, 10 pt, 12 pt, and 16 pt in the same document, and you pick up a typical digital implementation, at least some of those sizes are going to look crappy because there are no specific fonts included for display or caption sizes. If you need small caps or lowercase numbers you’re out of luck. If you want good kerning you’re going to have to manually adjust the kerning tables. (Not to mention, Times just doesn’t look very nice or even in the best case.) By contrast, Minion is an excellently designed and carefully implemented typeface which has been one of Adobe’s gems for decades and seen lots of polishing.<p>I think Butterick’s comments are inapplicable in general in this example: we’re talking about an academic typesetting his own documents not a professional typographer doing a paid job. But even in proper context, I think Butterick is being a little silly here. The job of a typographer is to figure out the client’s needs and solve the client’s design problems. Sometimes that means turning out stylish layouts that turn heads, but just as often that means getting all the little details right so the design gets out of the way and lets the content shine for itself.",1433760827

Drawing is very different, goal-wise, from design. Designers do learn how to draw early on their education, but I think it&#x27;s more a matter of learning how to &quot;see&quot; and developing other useful skills.

Not a bit of schoolwork was being done, and my Dad was having none of it.<p>So he gave me a summer job.  In the hot Australian sunshine, I was sent off to be a labourer on building sites.  Since I was the young blood, the brickies and other construction types gave me the shit jobs .. moving piles of bricks from one end of the universe to the other, shovelling shit from one end of the universe to the other, getting lunch and ciggies and mud and bricks to the brickies from one end of the universe to the other.

By all means I invite you to come up with a better model, without using uncountable sets, for which there isn&#x27;t a straightforward analogue, just as good, that uses uncountable sets.<p>Edit: Might as well jump straight to explaining how wave functions work without using uncountable sets, and why that&#x27;s a better description of reality.",1433759018

Being with a social group makes us worry we&#x27;ll lose our individuality. I&#x27;ll offer some tips.<p>People relate to those they perceive as similar. When you meet someone, there&#x27;s two stages to making friends. 1. Attraction, demonstrating you are valuable, which is easy for you thanks to your business success, and 2. Rapport, where you must show the other person you&#x27;re similar and am OK with making yourself vulnerable to them, and in trusting them, you earn their trust. I think you&#x27;re OK with 1, not OK with 2. Tell stories, being completely emotionally honest, and in ways where you show, at times, you&#x27;re just like they are. In the rapport stage where you&#x27;re trading stories, use the word &quot;we&quot;, avoid &quot;you&quot;. &quot;We&quot; can make someone think you&#x27;re already together, &quot;I&quot; can be used as an attempt to bring others to emphasise your situation, while &quot;you&quot; makes the other person compare differences with yourself. &quot;You&quot; can be useful for the attraction stage, but I don&#x27;t find it useful for the &quot;Rapport&quot; stage. And make sure to listen, and synchronise your emotions with them - if they&#x27;re happy be happy, if they&#x27;re upset about something, be concerned.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to find a romantic partner there&#x27;s one more stage but I&#x27;ll leave that up to you.",1433758952

Profit in the long term compared to profit in the short term.<p>Apple is in a unique position to achieve one without compromising the other. But Amazon is not in that position. Majority of their business is reselling products, they need to make sure their platform is best at reselling products.

3541853,comment,3541584,3541664,4,0,shad0wfax,,,"It would take way more than just a price comparison/best-deal site to compete (let even kill) Flipkart. Flipkart is executing certain things in this market very well:<p>- 1) A fantastic delivery/courier system (in major cities). They have homegrown service that does a reliable job. Courier deliveries in India is a painful experience. I won't be surprised if they spinoff a logistics arm!. To me this is their secret sauce.<p>- 2) Good customer support. I have bought quite a few things in the last few months and have sent them a few queries for which I have received quick responses. I think they are able to scale this with the current demand.<p>- 3) Fairly priced (not always the lowest, but definitely on the lower end compared to brick and mortar stores). I have found better deals on other online stores, but have resorted to buying on Flipkart due to their reliability. The key to success in India will be reliability, which is not something the public actually expects, but can become the differentiator.<p>- 4) Cash on Delivery for most items - Most people here don't use credit cards for online shopping. Cash on delivery is a safe and trusted option. The Junglee linked sites might offer the same option, but it can probably become confusing if some of the stores don't.<p>Yet, I feel there are areas in which a new entrant can do better and compete (keeping the service on par with flipkart):<p>- 1) A bigger inventory - I don't find all I need on flipkart. It pales in comparison with Amazon's inventory.<p>- 2) Product reviews - Right now Flipkart's reviews are just mediocre at best. What we need is more editorial reviews and organic reviews tailored to Indian market. I keep looking up Amazon reviews before purchasing stuff.<p>- 3) Better inventory management - A lot of popular products I purhase here in Bangalore (where Flipkart is headquartered) seem to ship from Delhi/Chennai. That is a loss of a day or two in delivery. Amazon can be a game changer if they invest in better warehouse management. End of the day for a similar price, the one to deliver quickest will win.<p>- 4) Better recommendation engine - No guesses why Amazon can recommend better (way higher sales and more data to learn from). Flipkart can get better at this over time, but Amazon can come equipped already.<p>I am an extremely satisfied customer of Flipkart, but feel it can get better and a new entrant might just make it a a competitive market.",1328168409

Academic and athletic talent still might be correlated in the general population, while sampling bias from the university admissions process over-represents dumb jocks and under-represents dumb non-jocks.<p>For example, suppose the academic ability of jocks is normally distributed about 105 with a std dev of 15, whereas non-jocks are normally distributed about 100 with the same std dev.  If the cutoff for admission is 110, but athletic talent gives you a 20 point bonus, then you're your comparing mean aptitude in a sample of non-jocks, given that every observation is >= 110, to the mean aptitude in a sample of jocks, given that every observation is >= 90.  Under those conditions, you'll find a 10 point difference in favor of your sample of non-jocks, even though the population mean for jocks is higher.<p>I think you alluded to this point in an earlier reply, but it's worth spelling out.",1328167671

3541807,comment,3540679,3541039,8,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Quite plainly, memristors are the most exciting invention in electronics since the transistor.<p>Our current understanding of memristors is that they have the capability to offer non-volatile storage at densities of flash or higher with speeds near that of SRAM. This alone provides several very simple implications. First, replacement of non-volatile storage systems with memristor based storage with much faster transfer speeds than what we have today. Second, replacement of main memory and CPU data and instruction caches with memristor storage. This would allow for systems that can be kept in ""hibernation"" for indefinite periods of time and transfer between being awake and being completely off in a matter of nanoseconds. This would vastly improve battery life for mobile devices and power efficiency for all devices. Additionally, it would vastly speed up the typical ""fetch, process, write"" cycle of most computations, improving overall computing power with equivalent logic hardware by huge margins. Imagine if programs didn't need to be loaded in memory because there was no difference between main memory and the ""hard disk"". Third, memristors can be used to create FPGA like devices which approach the space and power efficiency as well as performance of custom ASICs. That is a revolutionary concept. Imagine if you had a bank of programmable logic the size of your graphic card's GPU capable of transforming itself in a fraction of a second between given hardware configurations. That alone would fundamentally change computing as we know it. Fourth, potentially all of this stuff can be put onto a single chip, which would dramatically lower the cost and further shrink the size of a computer system, making them even more ubiquitous than they are today. Imagine a sliver of silicon only a few square centimeters in size containing an entire CPU, plus gigabytes of L2 cache, plus reconfigurable logic with the power of a GPU, plus terabytes of non-volatile storage that also serves as RAM.<p>Here's the kicker, all of these things are just trivial applications of memristor technology, but the revolutionary stuff is even more astounding. Memristors are capable of being used for logic on their own, much like transistors. And it seems to be trivial to alternate between using them for memory or using them for logic. Potentially you could create a single chip containing terabytes or even petabytes of memristors and the components of the chip could easily transition between configurable logic (in a different way than the FPGA like devices mentioned above) and memory, allowing the chip to match computing power to available resources and position computing elements close to the data being used for optimal parallelism and minimum latency. Not to mention that it would enable non-von-Neumann computing architectures. The implications of this are far too heady for us to grapple with today, it implies the potential for much more advanced machine learning systems and vastly more powerful computational resources than we have ever dealt with before.",1328167316

3541805,comment,3540679,3541651,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Hmm, I don't see it quite that way. Can you say more about ""general purpose computing"" ? Let me give a shot at how I think about it and tell me where I jump the boat.<p>Lets say you have an algorithm A which runs in O(n) time. We can define a property 'e' called 'entanglement' as follows:<p>The entanglement of algorithm A is defined to be the requirement of how much of A[n-1] must be computed before you can compute A[n]. An entanglement of 1.0 means that all of A[n-1] must be computed, and an entanglement of 0.0 means that the output of of A[n] is independent of A[n-1].<p>Algorithms with low entanglement are considered to be 'highly parallelizable' and algorithms with high entanglement are 'sequential'.<p>Amdahl's law shows that the performance improvement of an algorithm is limited by both its level of entanglement and by the cost of handling the partitioning.<p>As a systems architecture, if you can partition the problem into partial computation, you can sidestep Amdahl's law by running multiple copies of the same algorithm with the assumption that each partial computation will come out in one of many possible ways.<p>The simplest example I can contrive of this is binary division.<p>In general, to divide two numbers requires computing the partial remainder of each step of the division until you reach a partial remainder that is between 0 and the divisor. Each step 'n' depends on the step 'n' - 1 to get its results. Lets say you were dividing a 16 bit value by an arbitrary 8 bit value. You can create an alternate form of the problem using a 48 MB memory (16MB x 24 bits). Using the address pins A23-A8 to hold the numerator, and A7 through A0 to hold the denominator, and having the contents of the memory be the 16 bit result, and an 8 bit remainder.<p>The way I think about this solution is that you've created 16 million partial solutions, and the address lines tell you which of those solutions will be the one you are looking for.<p>I expect general purpose computing in a world where there are thousands or millions or billions of cpus available will evolve algorithms like the look up table. However instead of addressing read only memory, the relevant initial conditions will be passed to many partial computation engines, those engines will either respond with a value or not because they compute that their speculative computation would not happen with those initial conditions. And the responding engines may feed an subsequent layer of engines and they will respond or not.<p>You need look no further than the Map/Reduce work, or existing biological systems like immune response to get a grasp on how such a system exploits a sea of resources to surface a solution set of viable outcomes more efficiently. Some of the early work in constraint logic languages points this way as do some hardware description languages.<p>My belief is that having a highly connected sea of general purpose compute engines, and some additional tools to factor algorithms along their entanglement borders into partial computation fragments will radically change the way things get done.",1328167230

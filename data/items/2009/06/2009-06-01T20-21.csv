636773,comment,636335,636716,0,0,ajju,,,"""Saying what you want"" is not a right that supersedes other laws. No one can put up billboards (or even possess) child pornography because it is a heinous crime. Similarly, there are other limitations on free speech like shouting ""Bomb"" in a crowded theater.<p>It is actually legal (though obviously immoral) for a human being to say bigoted things about any religion. NBC cannot run a special saying the same thing because there are (quite likely, IANAL) laws against broadcasting hate speech on T.V. and the market itself also acts as a censor in NBC's case.<p>Saying ""free speech should be a Universal right of individuals"" is not equivalent to saying ""NBC should be able to broadcast a special propagating hate speech"". You are claiming it is.<p>So Janet Jackson can say fuck on CBS and she can't be punished for it but CBS can. I am pretty sure there is no law preventing a random person from spouting hate speech on TV (eg those people who shouted gays are the children of satan and other insults at military funerals) although there are quite likely laws requiring TV stations to take all measures to avoid giving such guys a platform.",1243889826

I live in Northern Virginia and that craziness does not surprise me one bit!<p>One night on the way home from grabbing one drink I accidentally turned into a govt complex that was probably CIA or something.  I figured I'd tell the guys at the gate I made the wrong turn and they'd let me leave.  Low and behold I was held within the gates for 3 hours, subjected to a series of alcohol tests conducted by several feds who rolled up in unmarked black suburbans repeatedly asking me what I was doing there.  At the end of all the huffing and puffing I passed every single test and was warned I got off easy as I was clearly intoxicated and next time things wouldn't go so smoothly.  This was after I agreed to a voluntary search of my vehicle with hopes of just getting the hell out of there.",1243889802

If Apple were smart (and I'm not saying they aren't), I'd think they would want to make sure that the iPhone/iPod touch became <i>the</i> platform for mobile computing.

Are 'African Americans' such a touchy subject that your capacity to comprehend what is being said is failing you when someone mentions them as being 'a social and economic underclass'?

It is about what <i>is the state of affairs in the world</i>.<p>Let me spell this exchange out for you:<p>- Several comments applaud the US for allowing immigrants to succeed.<p>- I point out that it's not the US, it's the OP. He could have succeeded in all of western civilization, as immigrants do.<p>- Gaius thinks only the US, UK and Canada are 'countries with long traditions of immigrants both assimilating and contributing to their culture'. He especially thinks Turks in Germany and Moroccans in France are 'an economic and social underclass'.<p>- I point out that this has to do with historical factors: there are many Moroccans in France, because it was a French colony for a long time. You could practically consider those Maroccans French. I point out that for those reasons, they are more comparable to African Americans, who also happen to be 'an economic and social underclass' (if that term applies to Moroccans in France, it applies to African Americans in the US. I'm going along with the discussion here, not arguing about a term I may not like). On the other hand, Algerians are well integrated in French society, as are Turks in Germany.<p>- Someone completely misses the point, because he mentions something that gaius himself had already covered as not being a good argument.

There seems to be a groundswell of people who have suddenly realised that it's totally unreasonable to charge what they charge for a cup of coffee.
The sheer ubiquity of Starbucks has also reduced their luxury allure.
Might be nice to have a pretty receipt, but as far as Starbucks is concerned, they might want to reduce the font of the price and ensure it smudges easily.",1243887574

Since you seem to have solid opinions on the type of vehicle you would like to drive (you mentioned type of vehicle, price, and powertrain) we would love for you to join the Local-Motors.com community and guide the vehicle choice process.  This is what it's all about!<p>The Rally Fighter is certainly not ""all purpose"" and does not satisfy my craving for a race car either.  For off-roaders who either want to get into desert racing, or already do it, the vehicle makes sense - in some ways, maybe more sense than anything else on the market.  And the idea of building it alongside an expert makes sense as well; if you are going to be out in the middle of nowhere and driving hard, it's best if you know how to take care of your vehicle yourself.  Even if it just means changing a tire or building confidence in understanding the vehicle limitations, this is a cool experience for those who desire it.  Again, not for everyone.  And that's the point.  The Local Motors experience is for the crazed car enthusiast - seems everyone knows one or two.<p>Electric makes great sense for some places and I'm certain that Lm will build an EV sooner than later; but for desert racing I think clean diesel is best.  The choice of powertrain is based on geographic availability of alternative fuel sources, as well as use of the vehicle.  You can't race Baja w/ an EV.  Where would you recharge on your 2k mile trek through Ensanada?  As of yet, it's not feasible.  Maybe in the future.<p>I think it's arguable as to whether or not Local Motors should have entered the market w/ a Tesla-like sports car.  But when you think of Tesla, Ron Motors, Fisker and others, do you think the playing field is a bit full?  Surely there is room for others to compete at that level, but we are not at that level.  We are not going to make very many Rally Fighters, and they will not be available all over the country.  This is niche.<p>We certainly have some proving to do but we are ready for the challenge!  The format is viable, and so far the community is supportive of the Rally Fighter (and there is talk of an electric Boston Bullet).  Hope to hear more of your thoughts.<p>Ariel<p>aferreira@local-motors.com",1243887398

Drupal is better suited than WP for each user to be throwing back as much content as they're consuming. When the membership is more ""flat,"" a la YouTube/Flickr/Facebook.  (Drupal is kind of notorious for making proof of concept clones of all the major social sites.)<p>Drupal also has hooks for creating ""nodes"" (a Drupal word for a page, basically), from external DB's, and can create custom content types, with any combination of fields/menus without making the end-user seeing anything ugly (WP also has a custom field type option, but it forces the publisher into a type of Administrator view, whereas in Drupal, you can make the custom content view look as pretty and neat as Twitter submit form, or any interface.)<p>Again, I'm NOT saying Drupal is better than WP, it's just really different. I actually hesitate to compare them. I think Drupal is more similar to Django/Rails. It's a framework, but with an really ugly admin panel, and it's that GUI that makes people compare it to WP, which of course has an incredible admin interface that makes any WP user rightfully wrinkle their nose when first using Drupal :D",1243886661

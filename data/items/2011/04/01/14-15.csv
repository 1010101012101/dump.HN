2396459,comment,2395154,2395724,19,0,jerf,,,"""I think anyone will agree that FDA's intentions are good.""<p>I don't entirely, though I'm not claiming malice either. The purpose of drug testing is to make drugs safe. The FDA has mistaken goals for means, and now they are testing drugs for the purposes of testing drugs.<p>If an untested drug has been used for decades by millions of people to treat a chronic condition that requires each of them to themselves consume the drug for decades at a time, that by itself puts such a sharp, strong bound on the maximum damage the drug may be doing that it is well in excess of what <i>any</i> study could possibly hope to establish. The improved methodology the study may have is simply swamped by the statistical power of a sample five or six orders of magnitude larger (measured in man-years) we have in the real world. In fact you just don't get any statistically more powerful than a ""sample"" of 100%.<p><i>Even if</i> the study managed to produce some small negative side effect there is no chance in hell that it will exceed the positive value of a drug for gout.<p>I've actually seen this before. Several children's drugs have been ""unrecommended"" by the FDA for toddlers, not because they could produce a shred of evidence that they were dangerous but because the studies-for-the-sake-of-studies had not been done. Again, decades of use by millions of people dominates what any study could produce.<p>(By the way, when I say ""dominates what a study would produce"" I emphatically do <i>not</i> mean ""is perfectly safe"". I mean precisely that a study will not be able to find the small damage. Drugs have after all gotten all the way through our stringent approval process and then had to be pulled because it turns out they were still dangerous. If the process couldn't catch the several diet drugs that turn out to give you a heart attack, it isn't going to pick up on something that could escape hundreds of millions of man-years of usage. Studies do not have infinite resolution.)<p>It's a continuing degradation in the standards of science, as the disease of scientific form replacing scientific substance marches on. That's why I don't claim ""malice"" in my first paragraph. Malice is not required, merely the raising of form above substance. I do not call ""intention to have good form even at the cost of substance"" good intentions.",1301669835

2396449,comment,2395920,2395920,2,0,mrich,,,"How to maximize happiness? One common constraint in life is money. If you have enough, you are more flexible to do what you want, including working a 9 to 5. If you need only a few material things, you will need less money and thus have to spend a smaller portion of your life earning it.<p>For the money you do need, the question becomes how to earn it. If you are lucky, doing what you love pays you enough. However, even if you do what you love there will always be times where you have to do stuff which sucks.<p>I am working as a software developer for a big software company in Germany. The job is quite interesting, colleagues are intelligent and friendly, pay and benefits are good. Of course, some of the time you will be working on stuff which is not so interesting, maybe even 50% of the time. This, and the fact that you spend most of your day in the office, makes me long for being more independent and having more time for myself and family/friends.<p>I also play poker and on some days I am able to earn more money than I earn in my job in much less time. However, playing poker as a job can quickly become monotone and boring. But it can also be more exiting than coding, plus you are very flexible with regards to working hours.<p>I'm also interested in startups and have thought about building a product on the side and slowly growing business. This would allow me to get maximum benefit from my skill (producing software and selling it multiple times, which is an unique opportunity for a software dev which makes starting your business so profitable nowadays) However, lack of time prevented me from doing so. If I had a partner I would be more interested in going this route, but as it is now I simply lack the time to do this in a reasonable manner. I will try to do small things like building an app in my spare time.<p>I guess for me, I will continue at my job and try to mix in the other two things. If I get really successful I can still quit the job. Of course, this makes it less likely that I will be successful. But the worst case outcome will be quite good too - I will have a secure, interesting 9 to 6 job.",1301669736

I rarely can remember birthdays, anniversaries, phone numbers, important dates in my history like when I graduated or the specific date of when my father passed away. I have hardly any memory of grade school, only can recall two of my teacher's names in high school, etc. Granted, some of those are less useful than others but they're things that people tend to remember and I don't. Instead, I memorize odd things like a Windows 98 CD Key, for example. I must've reinstalled it so many times that it just stuck in my head. Completely useless and yet it'll be with me for many more years I'm afraid.<p>I have found that I tend to remember things more if I put them into a rhythm, as if they were words in a song. I'm not musically inclined so I kind of find that odd, but it works. I used to work in inventory for a Best Buy warehouse and I'd often have to put UPC codes into a terminal for new inventory. I couldn't see the codes from the terminal most times, so I'd quickly memorize the code in my head by putting it into a rhythm. 1...2...3 4 5 6...7...8....9 10 11 12. Would be curious to know if that's common?<p>Anyway, very interesting article and I'm definitely going to try and put it to use.

Basic research has made tremendous advances in our health, standard of living and general wealth.  It's also very difficult to determine how much each person's contribution was worth.  I've read that surveys of late 19th industrialists and leaders who voted steam engine improvements as the most critical field for technological advancement for the next 100 years.  It's an amusing idea in retrospect, but who would have paid for research that would lead to flight or electric rail?<p>CDs, lasers, integrated circuits, etc... are great!  But what kind of ""demand"" was there for research into quantum mechanics 80 years ago?  Even if the demand were quantified, how much would each scientists contribution be rewarded?  Surely, Feynman and other scientists building upon Einstein and Heisenberg's ideas created something of great wealth for us!  But for the most part, those scientists won neither fame nor riches.<p>As long as the focus is on simple short-term supply and demand, this is how it works.  The scientist makes a clean pass, but it's the businessman or the engineer who takes the ball the last few paces, scores and gets all the glory.  I for one believe that China is doing it right in this regard.  The government is taking the lead in subsidising and investing in technological infrastructure as well as basic research to create more opportunities for private entrepreneurs in the long run.",1301667476

2396288,comment,2395883,2395883,5,0,PaulHoule,,,"It's not just ""social status"",  it's the fact that science sucks as a career.<p>Physics is a particularly pathological field,  but to take my own example,  I got a PhD in 1998 when the American Physical Society estimated that about 3% of physics PhDs minted that year would ultimately get a permanent job in that field.<p>Now,  one day I realized I could work for two years doing some obscure math and one or two people in the world might care,  or I could spend three weekends developing a Java applet and then get 50,000 hits to my web site and offers of consulting work.  Moving to computing was an easy decision,  but I still felt a lot of anguish giving up something that I really loved.<p>The people who stayed in the field,  however,  all suffered devastation in their personal lives.  I saw one postdoc,  who is one of the most brilliant physicists of his generation (or just one of the few?) and who had an excellent publication record,  in agony for two years because he had no idea how he was going to get his next job.  Somebody like that ought to be focusing on their research,  not suffering like that.<p>My thesis advisor and his female partner got professorships in places that were across the U.S. so he basically abandoned his son.  Another professor who was very helpful to me wanted to have children very badly but waited until his wife got tenure and had become infertile.  Another one commuted across Germany by train every weekend so he could see his family once in a while.<p>I can think of many physicists who are very pleasant people (particularly those who entered the field in the 1960s and before) but too many successful physicists are miserable emotional basket cases who've been scared for life by the process of getting a PhD,  getting a tenure track position,  and getting tenure.<p>Writers like Freud and Bly write about how people get abused,  come to identify with the abusers,  and then become like the abusers,  transmitting their trauma to the next generation.  The physics community is a clear example of this.<p>Now,  I know not all academic fields are this bad.  The supply of PhDs and jobs for PhDs is usually better in math and computer science,  two fields I have a little contact with.  The structure of biology research groups where professors sometimes supervise 10-20 students and postdocs suggests that the biology PhD may be,  like the physics PhD,  a form of exploitation rather than an apprentenceship.<p>Clearly the U.S. produces more scientists than their are jobs for scientists and anybody who says we need more is an ass.  If working conditions became more attractive,  however,  we might have a science community that attracts emotionally healthy people who will be,  in the long run,  more productive.",1301667173

In teaching it's relatively flat, and you need an advanced to degree to advance at all.<p>A relatively senior accountant makes vastly more than a relatively senior teacher, and oftentimes for only 6 years of US schooling (4 year undergrad + 1-2 year certification). To break into the higher ranks of teacher salaries (or in some areas to get a job at all) you're required to do a 4 year undergrad + a teaching certificate + a masters, so you're talking about $40,000 for 7 seven years of schooling, with a ceiling somewhere around $90,000 even with a PHD.<p>It might be fair to argue that you should be doing it for the love anyway, but I know people that would want to teach but specifically didn't go into it because they planned to have families and were worried about the income.",1301666837

For example, instead of making them pay income tax, you might give scientists 100% matching pay from the government.  That would mean that a company might hire a scientist at $80,000, but for the scientist it would be the equivalent of a normal $220,000 job.

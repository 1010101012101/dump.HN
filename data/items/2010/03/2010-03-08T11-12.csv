(This may include regulating food safety, ensuring that indigenous people with a close cultural link to land have a title to it, etc.)<p>* Obligation to facilitate: A further one is to facilitate food security. Like stimulating employment so people can afford it, land reform, and developing distribution and storage facilities. Or providing food or social security to those who can't work, such as the infirm.<p>Almost all of this could be applied to internet access.",1268049106

1175163,comment,1173679,1173679,0,0,jrockway,,,"Yeah, Asia is different from the US.  Different people, different cultural values.<p>I went to high school in Japan for a year, so I disagree with some of the author's points.  Nobody tried to isolate me from the ""real"" students, for example.  Nobody really cared that I was different from them; there was too much other stuff to worry about (exams, extracurricular activities, etc.)  I think a lot of people think that they are going to get special treatment for being white, and then don't, and then call it racism.  (And admittedly, there is a little of that from normal people, and it is usually cleared up when you are able to explain your situation in Japanese.  Same as any culture -- until you speak their language, you are considered retarded.  We do it in the US, too.)<p>Anyway, I know a lot of people in Japan that are software developers, and they opt out of the whole ""salaryman"" thing too.  In the end, it's your choice how to spend your life.  There is the easy path of least resistance, but if you don't like that, then you can do something else.  Just like everywhere else in the world.<p>The only thing I don't like about Japan is the political and criminal justice system.  This is beginning to annoy Japanese people, too, though, so the era of their third-world criminal justice system is probably coming to an end.  Maybe they will get rid of the rich career politicians too, although even the US can't figure that one out :)<p>(Looks like they finally have the concept of a ""trial by peers"" now, although it's not quite like the common-law system.  Better than ""you're guilty because some judge thinks so"", however.)",1268048657

1175157,comment,1174637,1175040,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> I don't know if I'd say MLK, Gandhi, or Franklin really ""sought the spotlight"". Their fame was mostly incidental of their deeds and wasn't particularly sought after, as a movie starlet or other pop-culture would-be icon might seek after fame.<p>I picked those three examples carefully - they're all men that heavily, actively courted attention and exposure, sometimes in very radical ways. Now, they did it for good reasons and put their fame to good usage, but they all were incredibly self promoting. Franklin was prolific at writing, debating, negotiating, and promoting his works and opinions. He even wrote about himself humorously in the third person under pseudonyms, making ridiculous claims at times. Gandi wrote 60+ letters per day to the most famous people in the world, including almost all world leaders, and actively courted press, especially for his hunger strike when he was almost constantly surrounded by media. MLK of course staged many demonstrations and gave many prominent speeches, going out of his way to break laws and get arrested in the name of civil disobedience.<p>All three of those men actively courted attention and media coverage, and thus fame - now, if the argument was, ""don't seek fame for fame's sake"", or ""only become famous if you have a good reason to aside from pride"" - I could buy that. But it's not what the author said. He said only idiots want to be famous. I'm rather certain Franklin, Gandhi, and King all knew what they were getting into and wanted to be famous. I also think none of those guys were idiots.<p>> Full disclosure on this, I guess, is that I also can't see much appeal in fame.<p>I feel the same way personally, but I don't think intending to get famous is stupid. The more people who know who you are, the bigger potential impact you can have. Actually, that's a pretty hard consideration I've made - some of the things I want to do would make me rather famous if I succeeded. I mean, hell, I spoke at a small conference once in a big city, and I was greeted 5-6 times while going about my day for the next week. That's a little scary, y'know? So I see it as a hard tradeoff, but it probably makes sense for a lot of people.<p>Edit: Didn't expect to be downvoted on this one - did I make a factual error? I know fame is commonly associated with degeneracy, but I think that's mistaken - saying ""Benjamin Franklin actively wanted to get famous, and did so, and used his fame for good"" - is that incorrect? I think the same of MLK and Gandhi. Actively wanted to get famous, and did so, and used their fame for good. Agree? Disagree?",1268048360

It does mean, however, that we recognize the overwhelming good for society that a system that carries free and open speech can provide, and make efforts to ensure it is accessible to all.<p>Similarly, for the internet I think our stance ought to be that it is something that provides an overwhelming good for not only this country, but for the globe in general. For this reason we should be ensuring that it is affordable and reliable to all.<p>Likewise, I think it is a right in the sense that no one should be denied access to it.

Even in cases where there's a logical summation to 100%, absolute values (the size of the pie altogether) is often also relevant; and pies with many slices are hard to compare, when the angles for different slice shadings are at different orientations.<p>Finally, too many charts rely on colour rather than patterns or markings to distinguish choices. That usually makes them hard to read for colour-blind people, as light shades of green and yellow, or dark blue and purple, etc. end up being used.",1268047574

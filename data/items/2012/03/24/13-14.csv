I think the C++ FQA (<a href=""http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/</a>) addresses a lot of the dislike people have with C++ that has nothing to do with ignorance of the language.<p>2. Saying that C# doesn't add anything to Java isn't even a simplification, it's flat out wrong. That argument may have been slightly valid in the C# 1.0 days (although there were quite a few differences like auto-boxing, properties, and pointer support), but the languages have diverged significantly, and modern C# code using lambdas, LINQ, and dynamic variables is signficantly different from Java.<p>Similarly, CoffeeScript and Javascript are massively different languages - the fact that CoffeeScript compiles down to Javascript doesn't mean the languages are similar, any more than saying Clojure and Java are practically the same since they both compile down to the JVM.",1332596153

3749314,comment,3748961,3748961,1,0,sharmajai,,,"I think for a language to be disliked it should be in one of the following categories:<p>1) First category is where you are forced to use it, and it is easy enough to get started in. For these languages the programmer base is big enough for the mandatory awkward features of the language be stumbled onto frequently enough to gather all the hate, and also big enough for the language hating to become a pop culture. Javascript, Java, Objective C, Visual Basic, PHP are languages in this category.<p>2) The second category is where you are forced to use it, but the language takes a long time to master, there are so many rules to learn and practice that unless you have spent 10 years coding in these languages, you cannot call yourself an expert. The hate for these languages is a different kind of hate and it spawns from the programmer's frustration to conquer the language completely. It's anybody's guess that C++ is the language I am talking about.<p>3) The third category is where you are forced to use it, and learning the language is just an annoyance mainly because it is just a different syntax for a language you have already learnt, and the learning effort that you put in is not commensurately rewarded by expanding your mind by introducing you to new ideas in programming. Ruby (does not add anything to Python), C# (does not add anything to Java), Coffeescript (does not add anything to Javascript) are such examples.<p>One constant across language-hating is that the programmers are forced to use them, either because their jobs require it (Java, C++, Visual Basic), or it serves a niche where there is (was) no equivalent (C++, PHP, Ruby on Rails, C#, Javascript, Objective C).<p>Then there are languages like C and Python, which are so freaking awesome, groundbreaking, and so much valuable for their niches that they just simply cannot be hated.",1332595742

MGH is obviously a large user base (interview with a hospital in Boston and it'll eventually come up in conversation), but the fun is when you get into the dialects of it.  For example, MEDITECH has their own dialect named MAGIC, and at least one of their employees has attempted to make things better.<p>I should try to get him to post to talk about it, but he created an object-oriented version of MAGIC that supported longer identifier names and other more modern constructs, as well as an interpreter that spewed out perfectly standards-compliant MAGIC.  Originally he was barred from using on existing, but eventually got approval to use it on new projects and I guess some portion of the MEDITECH developer population uses it over plain-jane MAGIC now since it's substantially easier to write and maintain.<p>Though recently he's reached out asking about the job market.  He's been there since his early 20s and now is in his mid-30s and feels as if he's dead-ended himself on the job market unless he gains familiarity with something else.  I think he's finally looking to break away from MUMPS.",1332595685

But I took the whole thing to translate as ""Startups are liberating!"" ... not ""People not doing startups are stupid!""<p>But you have a point... startups probably aren't for everyone, or even most people, but PG has to keep inspiring people to try for YC's sake.<p>(As an aside, sorry for the snarkiness of my last comment. I was at my Ballmer Peak right then, and reading it now makes me wish I still had the edit link O_o)",1206291561

144019,comment,143735,143991,0,0,pg,,,"The thesis is throughout the essay.  Didn't you read it?  I just quoted the last paragraph because it is a direct contradition of what they claim I said.<p><i>I imagine that new-hires at 37signals, or Fog Creek, would not feel they are missing out because they are not currently heading a start-up.</i><p>Now I'm convinced you didn't read it.  There is a paragraph explicitly about this:<p><pre><code>  You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling
  the size of company you work for. If you start the 
  company, you'll have the most freedom. If you become 
  one of the first 10 employees you'll have almost as much
  freedom as the founders. Even a company with 100 people
  will feel different from one with 1000.</code></pre>",1206290877
144018,comment,143148,143768,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I do the opposite: I often purposely include phatic cruft because I've found I can't convince people of anything without it.  If you look at my comment threads, there're whole paragraphs with no purpose other than to equivocate or make my argument more palatable to those who would otherwise discount it.  It's good for karma, but on a strictly technical level, the writing is weaker than PG's style.<p>I picked up this habit in the Harry Potter fandom, which aside from being a community of writers also happens to be 99% female.  Women's writing tends to include many more phatic expressions, because (particularly in something as socially-constructed as fandom) its <i>purpose</i> is often relationship-building.  I adapted to fit in; before then, my writing style often tended to be brusque, mechanical, and to-the-point.<p>I still use my old style in technical posts, where I figure the reader can deal with any unintentional rudeness.  For example, compare the last paragraph of this: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=144001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=144001</a> to this comment: <a href=""http://arclanguage.org/item?id=3103"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arclanguage.org/item?id=3103</a>",1206290729
144016,comment,143813,143813,0,0,sabat,,,"I work in the area. The weirdest thing is that the original Stacey's is in downtown Pleasanton, which is an older and quaint area with other locally owned restaurants.<p>But Stacey's at Waterford is in, as the article says, an unremarkable strip mall. Why? It looks like just another strip mall fake plastic PF Chang Chili's Flingers suburban food dispensery. I never understood why Scott would put a bunch of money into building an original restaurant next to PJ O'Pootertoots.",1206290267
144015,comment,143735,143946,0,0,tx,,,"I agree, and I think I was unnecessary harsh on ""wasting your life"". I guess I was just trying to say that in SV most success stories were driven by engineers: google, yahoo, facebook the list is long. Moreover, there is a history of it, look at Apple or even HP.<p>With that you get a very different corporate culture and overall ""climate"" if you will. This makes it a lot easier for an engineer to start a company and not being pushed to the background 1 year later by his investor's buddies. And living there, I suspect, makes it easier to understand and appreciate PG's views.",1206289965

Something seemed wrong.<p>I think it's not so much that there's something special about founders as that there's something missing in the lives of employees.""</i><p>I guess this is what has put off a lot of people, along with the reference to the caged lions, right at the start of the essay.<p>The key message (as i got it) from the essay was:<p><i>""one of the things that convinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a small group, is the natural way for programmers to live.""</i><p>It is spot on, and i completely agree with it.<p>In the 'Cliff Notes', Paul summarizes it well, when he writes people are reacting to what they imagine he would be saying in the essay, but yes, i guess the essay intro could have been worded a bit better.<p>Little what i have read of Paul's essays, it doesn't look like he would be intentionally putting down ""any"" smart programmer, just based on where (s)he is working, and i would still stick to that opinion about him.",1206289382

144010,comment,143735,144000,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Count the number of people who attempt to start a (tech) startup and compare with the number of people who go to grad school.  You've gotta apply Bayes's rule: P(success) = P(good outcome) / P(trying), not just P(good outcome).<p>Unfortunately, I can't use my personal experience as a reliable count, since I went to college and live in the educational capital of the world (Massachusetts).  It also happens to be a startup hub, and I hang around with lots of startup founders.  So both my count of tenured professors and my count of successful entrepreneurs are likely to be distorted.<p>Anyone have actual numbers we could use to perform the computation?  We need the number of students entering grad school, the number of new technology firms started, the number of tenured professors in the U.S, and the number of multi-million-$ acquisitions and IPOs.",1206288672

I will be adding this blog to my Reader, for sure.<p>I would say that although most companies wait until their logo is ""burned"" into the memory of customers, changing up the logo is a definitely a practice that is done.  Just think about when you watch a commercial on television, and you know it's Coca-Cola long before they tell you.  Is it the music?  Is it the certain shade of red?  It's branding.  The Economist is also known for its creative use of brand power; their advertisements often feature a very small version of their logo, if it's featured at all.  But the same dry, sharp wit for which the magazine is revered, leaves no doubt that the ad belongs to The Economist.<p>By the way, there is more information on the Dilbert-Google fiasco these two posts on the same blog:

144007,comment,143735,143886,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I have lots of 25-year-old friends who would like to start a startup but decided against it.  I'm trying to convince at least one of them to reconsider, since my cofounder quit yesterday and that leaves me a single founder.  Their reasons are pretty varied, but include:<p>1.) One has Marfan's syndrome and needs to work at a place with guaranteed health insurance to cover his medical bills.<p>2.) Two would like to start a startup in the future, but feel that they don't currently have enough experience.  This was also my reason for not founding a startup straight out of college.<p>3.) One was always interested in startups, but his family background has steered him towards law school, and so he doesn't have the technical skills to start a tech startup.<p>4.) One has a wife and two stepkids to support.<p>5.) One (my former cofounder) wants to start a startup, but got into Harvard Business School and figures a bird in the hand is worth 10 in the bush.<p>6.) One likes <i>working</i> for small companies, but enjoys his work-life balance too much to take the plunge and actually start one himself.  He also doesn't desire the financial rewards that come from a successful startup all that much.<p>7.) One couldn't do it because he's on a student visa and it was doubtful that the visa would let him co-found a company.<p>They're all good reasons, and you can see that they're a lot more varied than them all being caged animals.",1206288191

I grew up around farms.<p>The idea that most of the meat we eat was once animals grazing on grass has sadly been untrue for a very long time.<p>Most cows, pigs, and chickens are raised in tightly-packed conditions, and fed things you really don't want to know about. There are grains in there, but a lot of nasty things get mixed in with them.<p>A lot of land that could go to raising human food instead goes to growing soybeans, corn and grain that are fed to livestock. You're right that we can't just divert the grains from animals to people, but if that land were used to raise human instead of animal food, we'd be able to produce 16x as much food by volume as we do with meat.",1324655897

3385952,comment,3370341,3371697,3,0,andralex,,,"As a Facebook employee who holds a PhD, I can say we are constantly preoccupied about improving the quality of our interview process. In particular, the topic of how to adapt the interview process advanced degree holders comes about quite often. For example, I recall we recently discussed that we should offer PhD candidates the option to give a talk about their research. (The option is indeed available.)<p>That being said, I think a dismissive or patronizing attitude towards a coding interview would be mistaken. Allow me to explain.<p>It is quite well known that the ability to code is poorly correlated with holding an advanced degree or other formal pieces of evidence. A candidate with strong credentials understands this and should, therefore, not be in the least offended by being asked coding questions. As a good professional, the strong candidate would handle the questions with panache and should be ready for more difficult questions, discussing advanced topics linked to the question at hand, or discussing her particular area of expertise. Either way, she must be able to code her way out of a paper bag, and I see nothing wrong with the interview process probing for that.<p>I've interviewed a few dozen engineers while at Facebook, many with advanced degrees (because recruiters pair as well as they can interviewers with interviewees for areas of expertise), some from top 10 universities. I ask 2-4 coding questions extracted from my daily job, starting from undergraduate level and on rare occasions ending with a difficult complexity question. Nobody has ever done perfectly well, and for a variety of reasons holding an advanced degree doesn't correlate strongly with doing well.<p>All in all, I think you'd be mistaken to believe two weeks of rote memorization would be enough to pass the Facebook interview, which is very difficult. Overall, an attitude of professionalism, modesty, and focus helps a lot in any interview.",1324654508

What Paul did was censure.<p>Also, Paul's justification for not allowing SOPA supporters to go to Demo day makes financial sense as the primary advisor to the YCombinator companies.<p>Demo Day is primarily an event for investors and others interesting in furthering the success of those companies in his portfolio. It's a high demand event, and in order for Paul to keep the best interest of his portfolio companies in mind should only invite those people who will add the most value.<p>Anyone supporting SOPA clearly is supporting an action that is at best not relevant to a company in his portfolio and at worst downright bad. This doest just apply to current YCombinator companies but all future companies.<p>This bill does nothing but does nothing but give old businesses that have ceased to innovate a stick with which they can beat the innovative companies with. If you are in the business of innovation, you'd censure such people too.<p>I challenge you to go get anything Paul has said on this matter (ref: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=pg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=pg</a> ) and try to show that he is being a bully and not simply supporting and promoting the most rational economic decision as someone on the change/innovation side of the economy. The law should never be used to determine winners and losers. It should be there to protect the public while letting the markets decide who wins and loses.<p>This post smacks of taking the tone of articles written by journalists expressing the journalists' own viewpoints and extrapolating those viewpoints to be extensions of  Paul's intent.",1324652797

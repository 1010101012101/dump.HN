3712041,comment,3707960,3711213,3,0,sutro,,,"I had seen all those previous threads except for raganwald's ""Worse is Better"" link. I admit that link does make a decent case for the sock-puppet theory. However, I still think that nickb was a real person. I was an avid reader of New Mogul (great site, well done), and nickb's contributions there, as you know, were very extensive. The sheer volume of Nick's combined activity on both HN and NM casts doubt on the sock-puppet theory in my mind. Furthermore, in addition to finance, Nick seemed genuinely interested in B2B enterprise software sales strategy. I corresponded with him on email about that subject a few times. If you follow PG you know that is a subject that he takes no interest in and in fact encourages all the YC companies to eschew enterprise sales. Also I remember someone during one of the ""where's nickb"" discussions here or on NM around the time of his disappearance saying that he knew that Nick lived in Ottawa and was going to try to check up on him in person. The idea that Nick lived in Ottawa was corroborated by other comments that Nick or others had made in the past...I believe he might have been a professor there. Anyway my point is that there was so much effort behind nickb's contributions and enough detailed differentiation between him and PG that if he were indeed a sock-puppet the ruse would seem to go beyond being a joke and cross into the realm of split-personality, and for me that is a bridge too far. Then again I did always wonder why PG pulled him off of the leaders board after he disappeared:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/leaders"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/leaders</a><p>And as far as I remember PG never really commented on his disappearance. Either way, sock-puppet or no, I would very much like to know the rest of the story. Perhaps Ms Lowrey will one day solve the mystery for us.",1331873763

The monitoring is done by the record and movie companies. When they see a torrent of their content being shared, they record the IP addresses of everyone seeding that torrent and then send warning requests to the ISPs whose users are uploading. Those IPs then relay that warning to the actual users associated with those IPs. Once a user gets six of these warnings, the ISP is obligated to cut off the user.<p>At least, that's the way it was reported last summer, and that's how Ars Technica is describing the enforcement system now.",1331873736

You have to design algorithms to detect infringement and you have to implement them in a way that can keep up with a respectable portion of your backbone bandwidth without significantly degrading performance for consumers.<p>2) File sharing protocols can adapt rapidly and will most likely make more and more extensive use of encryption.  Distinguishing legal file sharing from illegal file sharing will only get more and more difficult.  Even if there remain ways to detect infringement, this arms race with file-sharers will feed back into 1 in a big way.<p>3) As Neil Young famously put it, ""Piracy is the new radio"".  Those who adapt to the ""new radio"" first will reap the rewards.  Those who spend massive amounts of cash fighting the inevitable progress of technology will just fall behind.<p>What should these dinosaurs do if they want to stay competitive?  Stop treating users of the ""new radio"" like criminals and win them over by providing a superior experience to what the pirates can deliver.  e.g. Stop loading DVD's and bluray's up with annoying advertisements, anti-piracy messages, and warnings.  Online stores shouldn't sell 720p videos or lossy music files when pirates are giving away 1080p videos and lossless audio for free.  Above all, minimize the payment barrier.  Make it cheap enough to feel like value is high and make it at least as easy and fast as pirating.  In short, stop spending money to treat your customers like criminals and, instead, spend it to ensure that legal purchases are the path of least resistance to the highest quality experience.",1331871204

3711907,comment,3710853,3711819,0,0,baddox,,,"The claim that the human brain is entirely physical in its behavior? That's an extremely common (albeit contentious) viewpoint held by AI optimists, as well as many general humanists. (In fact, to argue against it is by definition to argue for the existence of the supernatural.) I have always assumed that the vast majority of computer scientists would believe that the brain (and indeed, the Universe) is computable (in theory, of coursewe obviously would have trouble creating a computer big enough to actually do it). The popular CS books ""Gdel, Escher, Bach"" and ""The Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul"" both discuss the idea a lot, and the latter claims it as its central hypothesis.",1331870722

It's outrageous and irresponsible to not only stalk down his current location and place of employment, but then to announce it to the world, even though it serves absolutely no purpose. This is not a journalist, it's a hack. The publisher, in publishing this <i>crap</i> can no longer be taken seriously. It's tabloid journalism at its worse.<p>Article would have been fine without the ""I found him nyah nyah nyah and here's where you can find him and harass him too!"" stuff.

UIs that optimise for discoverability already exist; Windows and Mac OS X both do fairly well. The traditional Unix desktop has a different focus - why must people who use the traditional Unix desktop and are happy with it be forced to adapt to something else? Why can't we all just get along?<p>Put another way, the iOS interface, by rapidity of adoption alone, would seem to be far superior to traditional desktop-paradigm UIs. Would you agree that ""common sense <i>has</i> to take precedence"" and Windows and Mac users should have to abandon their systems and use iPads instead?",1279861134
1540407,comment,1538741,1539433,0,0,rdtsc,,,"Unfortunately, in this case I would agree with the original poster.<p>Your hyperbole doesn't quite work because we are dealing with human experience here. Poverty is not just a lack of money, it is most of all a very powerful internal human experience.  There is no words to describe it. Kind of like there is not words to describe effectively what falling in love or dealing with a loved one's death is. Understanding that is not just a matter of reading an equation, you have to experience it yourself in order to more effectively talk about or try to fix it.<p>Does that stifle debate? Perhaps. I think the original poster was highlighting that it is important to keep in mind  the personal experience before engaging in theoretical discussions about the subject.<p>> So why do we accept such a statement when it is made about nothing but a different sort of human experience?<p>The answer is in your question -- because _it is_ a human experience.<p>It seems to boil down to ""how important is human experience?""

Then I bought a Realforce (same keyswitches as the HHKB, but different weighting depending on the strength of the finger that presses the key.  great design.)<p>I showed my coworkers these, and they agreed that the keyboards were significantly nicer than any they had used.  And at around $250 for either, they were pricey, but that could be gotten over.<p>The end result was that one coworker bought a Cherry Brown-based keyboard that was $120 cheaper.  ""I don't really like it very much.  It's not as good as yours.""  Well, yeah.  Another coworker decided, ""I am definitely going to get a HHKB"", and ended up with a $30 Sun type-7.  Acceptable layout, $1 keyboard level ""keyswitches"".  ""I don't like it very much.""  Well, yeah, it's a $1 keyboard that you paid $30 for.<p>Topre keyboards cost $250 because they are worth $250.  When you make that in a few hours of typing on one, it's silly to try and save a few bucks.  My only regret is that I can't get the Realforce keys in a HHKB form factor :)<p>I also wish that people would learn where the keys are without looking, and how to press them with the correct finger.  I did that, and it has improved my comfort greatly.  (Actually, it made my left pinky hurt, since it is responsible for a metric fuckton of keys.  Hence the Realforce.)",1279860767

A common pattern is that there's general material in the first 10-50% of the book, which you probably want to read, then the latter parts of the book are series of specialized chapters and sub-sections on various techniques and variants of techniques. You wouldn't normally read every page of all of those in sequence, unless you were working really deeply in that exact area.<p>You can also often skip loads of stuff if you're reading for applications-focused reasons rather than looking to directly extend the techniques in question as part of theoretical research. I read a lot of logic papers, because I build tools on top of logic-programming systems, and I find that out of an 8-page paper, there's usually only 1-2 pages of material relevant to me. There'll be 1-2 pages of introducing a new construct, motivating why the construct is useful, sketching how it would be implemented and how it relates to other ideas; and then 6-7 pages of proofs showing that their extensions have all the soundness and whatever properties you want them to have.

They assume there is some  logical planning taking place in teenagers' heads before they get pregnant: ""...Having sex will lead to pregnancy which will lead to having a baby,  who, even though I can't support, the state will take care of it, my boyfriends will be forced to pay child support therefore it makes perfect sense to have a baby."" Something like that.<p>A 16 year old guy will think he can support all the babies in the world when having sex. The girl might think it will make the boyfriend love her more, they'll get married, find jobs, move out and have a happy your family and live happily  every after. That is a very different thought process than what policy makers usually assume goes on.<p>Teenagers who are privileged end up making a lot of stupid decisions as well, but their parents, hover over them, guide them, fix their mistakes for them and wait for the kids to mature and start thinking rationally and maturely.<p>Many poor teenagers never have that. They don't get a second choice, a do over for small mistakes. Many are from a single parent family, or their parents are working 12 hour days to make ends meet, perhaps one or more parents are drunk or on drugs and there is just nobody to guide, to teach and to iron out the consequences of small and large mistakes. Consequently the teenagers grow up but mentally never mature. Then they become the next generation of parents. Then the cycle repeats.<p>Overall I think all the teenagers would end up procreating as soon as they can if they just grew up in the wild without any parental guidance. The ones that lead privileged lives have parents who teach, guide and iron out mistakes (""read : trip to the abortion clinic""), and this leads to a delay in procreation until some arbitrarily chosen ""life event"" usually : marriage + first job + new house.<p>I think taking this problem and turning it into some kind of evolutionary / genetic issue is pointless if not plain dangerous.",1279858980

The Emperor's ""New Mind,"" we then suspect, is nothing of the sort as well. That computers as presently constructed cannot possibly duplicate the workings of the brain is argued by Penrose in these terms:   that all digital computers now operate according to algorithms, rules which the computer follows step by step. However, there are plenty of things in mathematics that cannot  be calculated algorithmically. We can discover them and know them to be true, but clearly we are using some devices of calculation (""insight"") that are not algorithmic and that are so far not well understood -- certainly not well enough understood to have computers do them instead.

I've read thousands of books cover to cover, I have about a thousand books in my library at home (about 300 ish technical books - I gave away another 300 or so)  and I am still in my thirties (Fwiw I started reading by myself  when I was 3. I buy a book every two weeks or so these days).<p>Even if you restrict the scope to technical books(assuming they have to be read relatively slowly) reading and completely understanding the content of a few hundred technical books is <i>well</i> within the scope of a human lifetime. It isn't even that hard if you work steadily in a disciplined fashion.<p>""And to top it, majority of books he has listed are pretty heavy and dense books.""<p>""Density"" is a function of what kind of background you already have. Dr.Norvig has a degree in Applied Math (Erdos number 4 I believe) and a PhD in Computer Science. I am sure he can read a ""dense"" tract faster than most people could. Also, most of those books (I own some of them) are textbooks. They aren't really all that ""dense"" (compared to a PhD thesis in Pure Mathematics, say). Most advanced material in CS/AI is in conference papers and rarely, if ever, make their way into textbooks till years after publication. I bet Peter Norvig reads a thousand or so  papers every year.

The primary stumbling block is going to be the ethics committee or finding an animal that has a large brain that ethics committees aren't particularly fond of. Or networking the brains of rats together to form a much larger neural net that interfaces to ethernet. Think EC2 with a rat brain on each server.

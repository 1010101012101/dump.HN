The ineptitude and lack of accountability by the powers that be is borderline criminal.<p>In a separate vein I'm sure I'm not the only one to realize that people in the West, and in America in particular, have forgotten how to make things. Be it fogbank, tanks, textiles, semiconductors and soon to be cars. We keep farming out manufacturing to the lowest oversees bidders and soon enough all we know how to do is place orders.<p>What happens, god forbid, when our trading partners become our enemies and they withhold the materials which we need to fight them. How about the semiconductors used in critical systems are compromised by foreign actors? All we can do is hope people at the helm have already thought of this stuff and are doing things to mitigate the risk. I'm not too sure.",1236578075

507974,comment,507509,507672,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"<i>The problem with these kinds of articles is that they make the assumption that governmental drug fighting efforts are sincere. They probably aren't that sincere to their original intent now.</i><p>I don't quite understand your usage of the word ""sincere"".  As an ER nurse that's worked in the ghetto of Chicago, I have worked alongside many law enforcement officers.  The thinking that hard drugs (cocaine, heroine, crack, meth) are bad and should be off the streets is a sincere and fairly universal belief.  The majority of the efforts that I've seen first hand in getting these drugs off the streets are well intentioned and sincere albeit ineffective and futile.<p><i>The DEA will probably never go away, because it keeps people employed for one thing, and helps large pharmaceutical companies keep small pharm companies (makers of class II, III drugs with expired patents) from building a legitimate enough business that would help these smaller companies spend money on new drug research. Keeping drugs illegal is good business; it has less to do with discouraging illicit drug use.</i><p>Wow, that's a really cynical point of view, and sounds very conspiratorial.<p>Mind you, I would have little problems with legalization of many drugs that are strictly controlled now.  I've administered cocaine and very strong morphine derivatives to patients for years.  I've also lost track of how many people's lives I've helped save from heroine OD's.  People make choices to kill themselves with alcohol.  They can also choose to kill themselves with cocaine as far as I'm concerned.  If cocaine were as cheap and abundant as alcohol, there wouldn't be as much crime as far as I'm concerned.<p>But the idea that Big Pharma is in collusion with the DEA to keep certain classes of drugs is silly as far as I'm concerned.  A much simpler explanation is that a large percentage of the population thinks that these substances are evil or too dangerous to be freely available.<p>You find quite of bit of support for legalizing marijuana on the Coasts, but even among the drug legalization crowd, I haven't really heard too many people suggesting that morphine/heroine derivatives like Vicodin and Oxycontin, or stimulants like cocaine be sold freely like alcohol or nicotine.  I don't believe that our society is ready to accept that.",1236577810

Downvoting is the only way you can get a (nonspam) submission off the frontpage. But on HN you can flag it and if it's bad the editors will kill it.<p>We can thus safely assume a nonlame set of articles, and we also (so far at least) assume nonlame voters.

507969,comment,507941,507941,0,0,patio11,,,"I'm confused:<p>1)  Most of the microlending is essentially aimed at being charitable, and is practiced in the third world.  Most venture capital is 0-for-2.  This is like comparing VC funding to consumption of chicken breasts.<p>2)  Kiva et al get good press.  They probably wouldn't if people knew the microscopic default rates were caused by local partners' automatically rolling over loans which go delinquent.  This creative accounting just papers over the problems (and we will, inevitably, see a reckoning here.)<p>3)  I don't see American entrepreneurs taking 100% APR debt anytime soon when many of them can do far, far better with consumer credit (which is itself a poor option for business financing, most of the time).  (Oh, they didn't mention that in the microlending presentation?  Must have slipped their minds.)<p>4)  There are significant regulatory hurdles in front of microfinance in the US.  Prosper, one American startup in the space, got essentially shut down by the SEC.  They're also legally capped at about 30% a year for interest, which is unlikely to cover defaults if you aim at the sort of customer Prosper did.<p>5)  I don't think loans in the $5k ~ $25k region would really help most startups that much.  They're small enough that it is doable with familial resources for most people who are middle class.  (The traditional first resort of startup funding.)  They're also small enough to be covered by personal credit, which would take the average working professional about a day to arrange (quite possibly at painful rates, but not 30%).<p>And unlike selling equity they leave the entrepreneur holding the bag if things go south, which is the major reason we don't tell everybody and their dog ""Put the business on your credit card!""",1236576961

A fund for investors in the 20-200 dollar range. (pulling numbers out of thin air)<p>While slightly riskier than traditional micro-lending the individual financial burden is light. It's a numbers game of course, if such a company had a good enough selection process it could be a good investment.<p>I believe there is no limit of sellable ideas, only a limit to how many can be found and exploited, and only a very practical limit to how small a profitable venture can be.<p>It would be very nice to see a vast sea of startups and an economy driven by a higher volume of investors that thrives on change, new ideas and a thorough profit-motivated vetting process.

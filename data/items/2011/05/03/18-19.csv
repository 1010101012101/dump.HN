2511224,comment,2507808,2509296,2,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"""Statistical machine learning. Basically, the past decade of AI research has discovered that trying to encode a whole bunch of rules into a computer just doesn't work, because the real world doesn't function like that. Instead, what does work is to feed the computer a lot of data, and then notice patterns like ""if this term appears, this article is most likely X"". There're a bunch of techniques for this in the literature, they typically aren't taught in undergrad, and they are wonderfully useful.""<p>Your first point is fully correct.  The 'expert system rules' didn't work very well.<p>On your second point, ""what does work"", actually doesn't work very well either.  You can use such things okay for first-cut, say, what J. Tukey called 'exploratory data analysis', then, to be followed by 'confirmatory data analysis'.  The first part is okay, but the solid stuff is the second.<p>Then there's more:  See what assumptions hold in the practical problem.  Use these assumptions as the hypotheses of theorems with proofs.  Use the conclusions of the theorems as results you now know about your real problem.<p>In real problems with a significant role for uncertainty, look for cases of probabilistic independence.  For this, learn the high-end version of what a random variable is from, say, Cinlar, Breiman, Shreve, or Diaconis.  Then for random variables X and Y, if knowledge of X doesn't help predicting the value of Y, then X and Y are independent, and can often come to this conclusion just intuitively.<p>Cases of independence can partition your problem into 'independent' pieces.<p>For more, look for some good examples of how to apply math in physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, and operations research.  For statistics, sure, look at what agriculture did with the general linear model or, if you will, analysis of variance.<p>You will have little hope of making progress in using applied math just within CS or computing.  For the progress, have to look to other fields that have made good progress with applied math.  Eventually it will be crucial to have a good background in math, say, Halmos 'Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces', Rudin, 'Principals', measure theory and functional analysis, and then probability, stochastic processes, and statistics based on these.",1304449191
2511223,comment,2511024,2511024,27,0,cscotta,,,"I'd like to offer a counterpoint to the author's suggestion that ""you'd be an idiot not to buy [and dispose of] a new laptop every year."" I'm a software engineer and put a lot on my computer's shoulders, running an entire cluster's worth of software as part of my development environment.<p>I value longevity and durability in products I buy. It's nice to pick a machine and stick with it. It's a long-term companion. It's about slowing ""disposable computing's"" cycle of production and obsolescence. It feels good to prove that, with a few upgrades over its lifetime, a well-engineered product can be useful -- even as a primary computer -- for years to come.<p>My Spring 2008 MacBook Pro (<a href=""http://cl.ly/2H1l2X1Q2w181Z2P1Y3P"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/2H1l2X1Q2w181Z2P1Y3P</a>) will be three years old this Saturday, and I couldn't be happier with it. My previous machine was a 15"" PowerBook G4 purchased in 2004. Both have been fantastic primary computers. An occasional upgrade and maintenance can make all the difference in extending the useful lifespan of a machine.<p>A few months in, I maxed out the memory to 4GB, which is still sufficient despite running our entire stack and an IDE or VM. Last summer, I replaced the 7200RPM drive with a 160GB X25-M. A few months ago, I added a second 48GB SSD drive via the ExpressCard slot to regain a bit of the storage sacrificed by choosing a faster drive. Over the three-year lifetime of the machine (so far), these upgrades cost about $625.<p>During that time, the manufacturer has also done a great job standing behind the laptop, replacing the keyboard/top case, one battery, and one power adapter. I'll take it in for one last servicing before the warranty runs out (to fix an unreliable Caps Lock key and clean the DVD-RW drive I never use), and may purchase one more battery at some point. Aside from this, it's in perfect condition and plenty fast enough for Java/Scala/Python/Ruby/Android development and testing.<p>This computer's followed me from the week I graduated college as an aspiring freelancer through three years of building a career in software engineering. It's got some life in it yet.",1304449190

If you've designed your application right in a traditional CRUD application, everything except the database layer scales fairly easily.  The game then is about finding ways to help that remaining bottleneck.  Standard techniques include optimizing queries, caching data intelligently, directing queries to read-only slaves, and in extreme cases sharding data across databases.

But experts note that ""the second thorium reactor may activate a third thorium reactor\n  - Thorium is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils, where it is about four times more abundant than uranium, and is about as common as lead\n  - Thorium-containing minerals occur on all continents.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium#Thorium_as_a_nuclear_fuel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium#Thorium_as_a_nuclear_fu...</a>",1304447073

2511032,comment,2509786,2509786,0,0,hugh3,,,"What's with this rash of illegal drug articles? Am I the only one who still thinks it's morally wrong to do something that's illegal, except in certain very special circumstances set out below?<p>Let me explain what I mean. There are just laws, and there are unjust laws. Just laws should be obeyed. Unjust laws should be changed. If you think a given law is unjust, you should be campaigning to change it, not breaking it willy-nilly. The cost of people taking illegal drugs is huge, from the drain on police and prison resources to the creation of the organized crime rings which support the drug industry, and if you're taking illegal drugs you're responsible for all of that. <i>If</i> you are correct and drug laws are unjust then... well shit, changing them is an important task for you, and you should get cracking on that.<p>Right now there's no great consensus over whether drug laws are just or unjust, but the majority wants to keep drugs illegal, even in California which recently failed to pass (by a huge majority) a legalization of marijuana. If you choose to live in a democratic society, why not obey the democratically ordained laws?<p>Yes, there are circumstances when it <i>is</i> acceptable to break a law which you regard as unjust. One such circumstance is civil disobedience, where you break an unjust law with the intention of getting caught and punished so that you can bring attention to how unjust that law is, but if you're not (courageously) <i>trying</i> to get caught and punished you're not a civil disobedient. Another such circumstance is if the law is so <i>horrendously</i> unjust that following it will directly harm others, but that certainly doesn't apply in this case.<p>In conclusion, if you want to take drugs then campaign for drug legalization. But <i>don't</i> go round breaking the democratically-devised law in the meantime.",1304446581

When you stop using coal, the effects start to go away.<p>Even with rooftop solar, you can measure the risks of maintenance personnel falling off of roofs and production accidents. Again, current risks that can be measured and evaluated. If you take the panel off of your roof, there is zero risk of someone dying as a result of your panel.

The other 2 dimensions are consumption form and cannabis strain - combining these 3 dimensions results in very different mental states.  However, the laymen looks at marijuana effects and thinks ""high"", ""stoned"", or some other mental state that is equivalent to their college experiences or perhaps a drug addict.<p>Consuming marijuana through ingestion vs inhalation results in a completely different mental experience as a function of how these consumption methods throttle dosage over time.  Ingestion will spread a dosage over 4-6 hours, whereas inhalation will expose your mind to this same dosage in in .5-1.5 hours.  Also, inhalation has a THC absorption threshold that is much lower than ingestion.<p>And, of course, cannabis strains themselves each offer completely different experiences.  Small doses of sativa strains vs large doses of indica strains produce a light, highly energetic feeling vs a stoned feeling, respectively.  <a href=""http://www.leafly.com/explore#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leafly.com/explore#</a><p>Combing these 3 dimensions, dosage, consumption type and strain produces a broad range of mental states that can be anywhere from empowering, to euphoric, to self-destructive.  Like anything else in life, the key is to be disciplined and adjust these 3 dimensions for your personal goals (of course, being disciplined about adjusting dosage to 0 as a bias).<p>But consider work, play and deliberate practice (<a href=""http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3881908748/tldr-summary-the-role-of-deliberate-practice-in-the"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3881908748/tldr-summary-the...</a>).  Marijuana affects the hippocampus, and our ability to form memories while under the influence of the drug - this can be a positive in some contexts and a negative in others.  For instance, when doing repetitive work, low doses of ingested sativa can actually enhance productivity of results for mundane work - no learning is necessary, just execution.  For play, low doses of inhaled sativa or indica can inspire creativity for hours - leveraging the cognitive cycles previously reserved to querying and storing memories for your mind to test new hypotheses about incoming information.  For deliberate practice language learning is key, so most contexts of deliberate practice would likely be harmed by introducing marijuana.  Of course, some individuals may benefit from low doses that offset the mundane repetition for a net benefit.<p>Anyhow, I don't claim to be an expert in these matters, but simply to point out that judging Marijuana users as simply people that like to ""get high"" is utterly and completely ignorant of the reality.  It is a judgement, a prejudice and a symptom of pervasive mis-education in our culture.<p>Of course, these are ""opinions that [I] would be reluctant to express in front of a group of peers"" (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html</a>) - present company apparently excluded.  Rationally, it makes sense to me that drugs exist that allow me to exercise discipline and tweak my mental state for the task at hand - from caffeine, to ritalin, to THC - and everything in between.  However, due to the legal status of marijuana, and people's own experiences with using the drug to get stoned, avoiding judgement and prejudice in todays world (even amongst the highly educated and successful) is a taboo.  I look forward to the day when I can have open, educated conversations about the effects, benefits and harms of marijuana.  I also look forward to the day when I can have educated conversations about marijuana with intelligent people and not be judged as someone who simply ""likes to get high"".",1304446016

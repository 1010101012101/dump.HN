It's charitable, and therefore there is no cut taken by the middle man (the charity), and the loan is paid back without any increase.<p>Based on my rough glance, it's not exactly an area with much in common with HN - most people seem to want the loan for a market stall, or a shop, etc.<p>But I ponder - they say that around 98% of loans get paid back in full, and the loans requested seem to average at under $1,000. Might it be a sane investment plan to, rather than loaning it charitably, set up a similar scheme whereby they repay giving the investors a slight profit?<p>If 98% can repay 100% of the loan in 12 months, what if that changed to 95% repaying 120% in 18 months? Could potentially receive an average of ~15% profit on each loan, with the benefit that you could invest anything from $500 to $100,000s, and it could be set up in a similar way to allow low-budget investors to get in?<p>To run it as a charity seems like a lovely idea, and I'm not someone to look at every charity and think ""what if that was turned into a profit-making excersie..."" But if a small amount of profit might bring in a far greater number of investors, and therefore a greater number of people getting their lives changed for the better...<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on this? And/or are there already people investing like this?",1291819932

1983003,comment,1982536,1982536,0,0,retroafroman,,,"I don't know of a good LOGO interpreter for Windows, but I have had some experience teaching programming to kids.  I interned with OLPC a few years ago, and they have a visual progamming application called Turtle Blocks which is very similar to LOGO.  Unfortunately, it's only available in Sugar (the Fedora Linux based OS that they use on the XO-available as a live USB). Also, MIT's Scratch is another program that is available for Windows and Mac that is designed for visual programming for kids, but has many more features than LOGO or TurtleBlocks.<p>When I was working with OLPC, my boss Elana would make teachers and students try to understand the idea of giving and following exact directions before letting them jump onto the computer.  Outside, they would have someone act as the ""turtle"" and they would receive directions like ""walk forward 5 steps"", ""turn right 90 degrees"", ""take one step back"", etc.  This way, they were tasked with walking in a square and ending up in the same place they started.  Before they could start though, they had to write out all the instructions they would give to walk the square, then a person would interpret them. Just like how a programmer writes a program and only after it's finished a computer interprets it.<p>I'd make starting off a game like this, just following directions. Have her give you the directions to walk from one room to another while avoiding obstacles.  Having gone through this thought process, it makes understanding making the little cursor on the screen do something a much less abstract experience.<p>After getting the cursor moving around the screen and drawing boxes, I think that one of the best ways to get a kid excited about programming is just by showing cool examples of things drawn in LOGO.  Then pick a simple, short script and step through it with them.  From there, start changing parameters one at a time and point out that the output is different. Of course, at this point, a challenge is necessary and possible.  Have them try to draw something that they like, or a stick figure of themselves.  If she can do that, then try making a taller stick figure for you, or something like that.",1291818579

The main issue for Django developers is that on GAE, you're using a nonrelational database. Assumptions about the RDBMS run deep in Django and in most Django apps, and great effort (see django-nonrel) is required to present even the thinnest veneer of compatibility.<p>In my experience (>2 years of GAE consulting for paying clients) I think using GAE is probably the wrong choice for most new projects. If you're new, you need to be able to iterate ideas quickly and you will value tools that (1) give you flexibility, (2) offer a lot of useful reusable libraries, and (3) have a large and stable culture (good docs, stable APIs, people you can hire). And if you have a scalability challenge somewhere down the road, it would make perfect sense to rewrite most of your app on a platform like GAE -- after all, by that point you'll have the basics of design quite solid, so you don't need as much flexibility, and every other part of the effort gets easier when you have money to throw at it.<p>It is a common misconception, though, that AppEngine serves the same needs as Heroku, or is a Heroku equivalent for Django. I think that's the main reason we didn't see more Herokus-for-Django* earlier.<p>*Disclaimer: I am a founder of <a href=""http://djangozoom.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://djangozoom.com/</a> .",1291818282

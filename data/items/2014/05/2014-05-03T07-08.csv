The first place I can remember? The place where I went to elementary school? The place where I went to middle school, high school, and college?

7689948,comment,7687641,7687848,7,0,malkuth23,,,"I sometimes operate media servers that deliver video for several classical pops concerts including Fantasia and a number of more modern Hollywood type movies. The conductor gets a special synchronized video feed with white dots flashing to indicate tempo, colored lines to show when changes are coming up and bar numbers, all superimposed over the movie. The conductor has to speed up and slow down the orchestra in order to match the music exactly (or as close as possible) to the original video. I never change the speed of the video. Some pieces seem to be harder and also require a click track. These are shows that obviously require very close attention to the conductor.<p>I always wonder if all the orchestra was given a click and a copy of the modified video, if the conductor could just sit down and eat a sandwich. Of course, that is kind of like contrasting watching a DJ that selects mp3 tracks vs someone who can adeptly spin vinyl.<p>Curiously, I can tell you from listening to the conductors speak candidly, they often consider this sort of conducting much harder despite these added tools. Even when they are playing very familiar pieces like the music from Fantasia, it is very difficult to match it so exactly to the original. They compare adjusting the speed of an orchestra to speeding or slowing a freight train.<p>With professional orchestras, most only do 1-2 rehearsals before the shows I control video. It is amazing how fast the musicians take notes and adapt to the direction of the conductor. There is almost always a marked improvement between 1st and 2nd rehearsal and the actual show.<p>I will say that having stood at the conductor&#x27;s podium at many of the top theaters in the U.S. (while empty) - it is an incredibly intimidating thought. Every seat points straight at you. It is much more singularly focused than a dramatic stage. It definitely has given me (someone with very little musical understanding) a great deal of respect for their responsibilities.",1399101761

Do you consider the slide to unlock on a floppy disk or SD card to be an innovation?<p>Literally, humanity has been using the slide to unlock metaphor everywhere imaginable for years. It&#x27;s very common metaphor.<p>What&#x27;s next? Patenting waving your hand in front of a electronic star trek door to unlock and option it? Quick someone go out and patent this obvious idea.<p>Heck even the historical phenomena of signing X on a line in a contract when you&#x27;re illiterate and don&#x27;t know how to write/spell your own name is rooted in the same idea as slide to unlock on the iPhone. What&#x27;s the simplest shape you can make with a writing utensil that demonstrates clear intent to someone who did not observe the act and cannot infer is something was intentional or accidental? Basically a circle or an X. A simple X is sufficient to communicate intent to a person that did not observe the action of signing the contract. This is essentially a &quot;two phase commit&quot;. A slide to unlock mechanism is both performed and confirmed by the same person and doesn&#x27;t require the second stroke requirement. With this in mind, the obvious design choice is only require one single stroke since it&#x27;s sufficient to demonstrate clear intent and is cancellable (e.g. a half stroke doesn&#x27;t count). Since the requirements are more lax a single phase commit is sufficient (i.e. a single swipe).<p>Or how about those old TV remotes that used a sliding cover to hide the lesser used or configuration/setup controls? Or how about those phones that hid a phone keyboard behind the screen. There are three obvious choices, slide open, swivel open and flip open.<p>What if I took the phone and slid my finger to the right but instead of sliding a skeuomorphic button the animation was instead a page or book cover flipping over? Or what if I did a arced swipe and &quot;threw the lock screen&quot; away the same way you force quit an app in iOS 7. What if I hold my finger down and the screen animates to a certain color over a short duration (maybe like when Mega Man powers up his special charged blaster cannon shot? These are all obvious since this are so incredibly analogous to other use cases.<p>Take every new invention in the future where something needs to be unlock. I&#x27;ll bet you the value of this settlement that almost every single future human invention that fits the narrative of unlocking or enabling is going to have some interface that either is literally slide to unlock or maps very clearly to that metaphor.<p>Even opening your eyelids is slide to unlock.",1399101464

It doesn't matter if you ""can"" eat grains although they're almost never available in a format that meets the other requirements.<p>Don't try to tell me every american, especially fat ones, cracks open a can of creamed corn kernels every meal for a vegetable.  In a modern fat american diet, grains = wonder bread (or equiv) made out of sugar, oil, and HFCS, doritos made out of oil aka junk food.  Pizza with the wheat and soy flour crust baked on oil with a super sugary sauce covered in oily meat and dairy cheese.  What, if anything, do americans eat made out of grain that isn't a junk food?  Bread is junk food.  Donuts are junk food.  Pretty much everything from the bakery is junk food.  Breakfast cereal is junk food.  Granola bars are junk food.  Oatmeal (my son needs special GF uncontaminated oatmeal..) is just a delivery vehicle for 25% by weight brown sugar, butter, and maple syrup, so thats junk food too.  Anything fried, baked, and heavily seasoned and sealed into a shelf stable bag contains wheat and/or soy and is junk food.  Is there any junk food out there made without dairy, soy protein extract, or wheat?  I have extensively researched this and the answer is basically ""no"".  My son can eat a couple kinds of corn chip and some unflavored potato chips, thats about it for his ""typical american diet"" junk food.  Almost anything ""heat and eat"" from the freezer section of the store is off limits.<p>My son has a medically diagnosed allergy to a protein in wheat.  So for about a decade, no wheat (ditto soy and dairy ... so we eat what boils down to medically required paleo diet at home since about 2004, although we don't (probably to our detriment) exclude potatoes, rice, and beans).  Coincidentally, exclusion of wheat pretty much excludes all junk food.  There's not much he can eat in the category of ""junk food"" other than some plain potato chips, and specialty expensive therefore rare exotic gluten free junk food.  I only get to eat ""junk food"" while at work, its not like I'm gonna dig into a cake in front of a kid who can't eat it without exploding out both ends...<p>I see it as a happy coincidence.  If the FDA mandated all junk food contain blue food coloring, and a diet was proposed that we shouldn't eat stuff made with blue food coloring, it doesn't ""really"" matter that its not the blue dye making us fat...",1363003192

May I suggest that you and I were not introduced to the same paleo diet? I recommend that you look up Robb Wolf.<p>>> Yes, eating lots of carbs is bad for you. So is eating lots of fatty food. Or lots of anything. Just eat lots of green stuff, and make sure you get adequate amounts of protein & carbs. To lose weight, make sure calories in < calories out.<p>Oddly, this is very consistent with what is promoted in the diet.<p>>> It mystifies me how otherwise-intelligent people can get so caught up in fads such as Paleo, backed up by flimsy pseudo-science.<p>Attempting to belittle people who choose to try the diet doesn't make you smarter and certainly doesn't prove nor validate your arguments.<p>>> My theory is that they appeal to the contrarian in us - after all, they're delightfully counter-intuitive in some ways (eating lots of steak can be good for me?!).<p>That is indeed only a theory. On the other hand, maybe some of us actually do see some results.<p>>> And if you still think it does, look up the diets of the top 10 athletes in basically any sport & explain to me why none of them are on Paleo.<p>The diet is extremely prevalent in the crossfit circles (it's even increasingly overshadowing the official diet, which is The Zone diet) and mixed martial arts (many of my training mates switch to it prior to competition). During my own research I stumbled upon this interview <a href=""http://youtu.be/r-WRn8UttXw?t=10m"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/r-WRn8UttXw?t=10m</a> (interview starts 10 minutes in the video, somewhere within the first 2 minutes after it begins Joe Rogan mentions having talked to many fighters who are on it).<p>My take away: ""otherwise-intelligent people"" use the diet as a set of guidelines for improved health and quality of life. You can choose to take it as a religion, but then lots of things just get more difficult. If you practice a sport, you need to adapt the diet to the demands of your discipline. I recommend to look up experts who are more sport oriented (I mentioned Robb Wolf earlier).",1363000981

To make matters worse, there is an overwhelming abundance of less-than-scientific literature following the latest ""fad"" scientific results, plugging some diet ""silver bullets"" and to top it off, most ""professionals"" in that area are nothing but gym rats that payed lots of money for some training on a specific diet fad and then that is the only thing they will in turn plug to their customers. And the actual professionals, as in doctors, well mostly they appear to not be up-to-date with the latest-and-greatest ""proven"" theories so I always feel like I am missing out some of the good stuff that the latest fads are promising me.<p>All I wanted was a REALLY, actually healthy diet. Do I eat mostly wholemeal bread and rice as is common where I am from? Paleo and Atkins tells me this is literally poisoning and destroying my body and THE worst thing I could do next to shooting myself in the stomach. So only lots of fat, meat and vegetables? But ""everyone knows"" lots of meat is bad and one should only eat meat maybe twice a week, says the official generals statement here. Of course there are the different shades of vegetarians and vegans who all have discovered the one truth and the ONLY ethically correct way of living and they have the studies to back them up on the ""healthy"" side but e.g. the legumes they are eating are supposed to be literally poison according to the paleo crowd... yet beans are healthy, says another group, also backed by studies. Oh and fish, we all should eat more fish right? Yet we keep hearing how polluted the oceans are and how fish are full of mercury and probably nuclear waste from dumping it into the north sea. And I could go on and on and on....<p>For practically each diet recommendation or ""fad"" backed by studies you can easily find at least one opposite or contradicting study and at least two other, even more ""true"" and new diet fads.<p>Ultimately, this means I have no idea what I should actually, really really be eating and it leads me to the conclusion that: diet and health are the educated masses' modern equivalent to religion. Everyone is following their one true savior and will launch into borderline religious flame wars against the ""infidels"" of the other fads and theories.<p>Yet actually definitive answers seem to be missing.<p>And I am sorry if this seems like an incoherent rant, somehow it is, but I assure you with all the best intentions.

So lots of tutorials, maybe register a www.learnsql.com like domain and really push it as an educational tool.<p>Question : Would you use a tool like this to teach SQL or recommend it to people learning SQL ?<p>IMHO :<p>Pros
 - Visual feedback (you can highlight/color rows that match your query)
 - Familiar comfortable environment for newbies
 - Possibly easier to set up in a night-classes or school environment than databses<p>Cons 
 - If someone is learning SQL they will eventually need to learn about a RDBMS so why not immediately
 - Excel has some stigma",1266069551

Please tell me how many different varieties of assembly language exists like x86 etc,,their differences(how do they differ from one another) 
which varient should i choose?
Please give me some insight on the tools that are needed for programming in assembly.some say i need to buy a intel 8085/8086 kit.but others say a simulator would do.i'am damn confused.
also suggest good simulators if that's the case",1266068993

If we actually mean that, then 2x differences in numbers of hours worked should be quite sustainable.<p>This might interest you if you haven't heard of it:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROWE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROWE</a><p>Results Only Work Environment - you agree on a set of tasks with your manager, you complete them, you get paid. Doesn't matter when you do it or how long it takes you. That lets people choose to work at a slower pace with more goofing off on Facebook or webcomics, or work in a blaze and hit the beach, or whatever. People who wish to produce manic levels of work can produce more and get paid for it as gauged by results, people who want to work less can complete less tasks can do so and still get paid a reasonable amount. I think there'll be some kinks to be ironed out, but it's more or less the future.<p>> (Oh, more bad news: robots can already do that, and it will only be a few more years before the cleaning company we outsource to figures out how to exploit that differential profitably.)<p>Cleaning floors is notoriously hard to outsource, but the technology-in-theory for automating/roboticizing much more of manual labor is already there. It's why I'd like to see the world get more wealthier - people have a false believe that if there's no more poor people, everything will get more expensive. Pretty false idea - if more people are doing R&D, pure science, engineering, art, programming instead of manual labor, we'll see huge gains in new innovation and can roboticize/automate much of the manual labor away. Hell, when I was in China I'd see like 30 guys with chisels tearing up asphalt which you'd have one guy with a jackhammer doing in the States. The labor was cheaper than the machinery, but as the Chinese get more educated and into high skilled work, that'll change and they'll switch over to jackhammers and whatever we invent next after jackhammers.",1266068300

You can tinker with it endlessly.  If you're a perfectionist then software development is probably not the career for you.  I look at writing software in the same way that an author might look at writing a novel.  At some point you have to publish.  There are always alternative plots that you can think of, the characters aren't always as interesting as they could be and sometimes there are regrets and missed opportunities.

I have a theory that if it is regulated, kids would actually have less opportunity to use it because in order to get it they would have to find someone to buy it for them or give it to them and that person would be taking a risk for little benefit much as with the purchase of or giving alcohol to a minor.

1863822,comment,1863678,1863678,0,0,ajays,,,"I was sort-of expecting this. I am very disappointed, even though I don't smoke pot. To me, it was a question of personal freedoms.<p>Here are some reasons why Prop 19 didn't pass, as far as I can see:<p>1. Fear of the unknown. People are fairly comfortable with the situation right now: small-time tokers don't usually get busted; anyone who wants to light up can get it from a neighborhood 'pharmacy' with a doctor's letter (or via a friend with a doctor's letter). So why change a good thing?<p>2. Fear of the feds. Eric Holder deliberately came and put the fear of federal retaliation into people. Why did he have to come down and take sides in this _state_ proposition?<p>3. Medical Marijuana folks. I was surprised to see that quite a few medical cannabis dispensaries were strongly opposing Prop 19. I guess they're doing a roaring business now; if Prop 19 passed, their business would have suffered badly as the recreational smokers no longer needed them. Shame on them for putting profits before principles.<p>4. More fear, this time about the wording of Prop 19. A lot of people came out and claimed that Prop 19 was flawed, it would make matters worse, etc. Just this evening one anti-19 guy was on TV, saying ""Prop 19 doesn't ban smoking weed just before you get into the car and drive"". Well d'uh! There's already DUI for that; does the Prop have to explicitly lay out and ban each and every way one can get high on pot? Use common sense, people.<p>5. Recent law in Sacramento that turns possession into an infraction.  Many people are unaware of this, but the State legislature passed a law a few weeks ago (and signed by Arnold) that reduces the penalty for possessing a small amount (1oz or less) to and infraction; just a $100 fine, and no jail time. This, to me, is still a victory for Prop 19: had Prop 19 not been leading, the legislators would not have passed this new law.<p>So all in all: I'm disappointed that Prop 19 failed; but at least we got a law in the State that makes possession just an infraction.",1288763182

Go ahead and read the wikipedia about it or any of the articles in the major california papers.  Many say the same thing:  legalization is inevitable, but this isn't the way to do it.  It went too far on protecting pot (such as disallowing local ordnances from prohibiting outdoor grows.)  Also, it allowed too many varying tax situations.  Essentially, passing it would be empowering bad governance.<p>Unfortunately,  voting against prop 19 as a bad law isn't differentiable from voting against prop 19 as a proponent of prohibition.<p>When legalization passes, it will have to satisfy people's NIMBY impulses while protecting considerate adult consumers.",1288762851

It will get struck down by every court that reviews it, unanimously so by SCOTUS (if it makes it that far). It violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution which says Federal Law trumps State law (when they conflict) and Prop 19 clearly contradicts the Federal Controlled Substances Act.<p>Now, medical marijuana also violates the Federal Controlled Substances Act, and so technically the Feds could go in and enforce federal drug laws against medical marijuana users/growers in CA, and they actually threatened to do so, but they have since opted to let California enforce that law on its own, which CA has basically decided not to do. That same thing could play out here, with the Feds making an empty threat to enforce FCSA in California, and CA calling the Feds bluff and basically refusing to enforce Federal law.<p>Even if you support marijuana legalization (which I do), you shouldn't condone states simply ignoring Federal Law. If you think its acceptable for CA to ignore the FCSA, do you also think it's acceptable for states to ignore the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Obamacare, Federal Minimum Wage Laws?<p>Also, it won't be hard for the Feds to force California's hand. The Feds can threaten to withhold funding from CA unless they follow what the Feds want. This is how the Feds forced a nationwide drinking age of 21 (see: South Dakota v. Dole).",1288761447

And I'm also more than familiar with having missed out on opportunities because I talked myself out even trying.<p>So, with my credentials out of the way...<p>Here's that email link for Michael, use it: <a href=""http://www.valvesoftware.com/email.php?recipient=Michael+Abrash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.valvesoftware.com/email.php?recipient=Michael+Abr...</a><p>Don't know what to write? No problem, you've already written it:<p>-----------8<-----------<p>This is it. Never has anyone more perfectly described the way in which I want to work. I love to work in teams on projects where I feel I can make an impact to the extent of my capabilities and starting projects myself is deeply entrenched in my nature.<p>I've been thinking about wearable computing for the past 5 years and even went on to study Computer Vision because of it, but after 3 semesters i switched the field to general computer science, mostly because i didn't exactly wanted to reimplement AR-Engines and learn about all the algorithms behind object recognition but just use them for the things I had imagined. I've been working in the past year with Metaio's AR Framework called Junaio and Qualcomms AR SDK for Unity 3D and will write about some of my ideas and findings in the next weeks. (You can create impromptu Project Glass glasses by taping a HD Screen Phone like the Galaxy Nexus in 10-15cm distance from your eyes onto some fake glasses and add counter weights on the opposite side, it's enough for testing all the ideas you have in that field until the real Glass comes along)<p>Right now i feel very bad about my decision to switch fields and focus on working more while studying to get more experience, simply because I think that if i would've finished my computer vision studies i would feel more adequate to send them a job application now...<p>Don't forget that Valve is a 300 people company from america who has a fame of being an awesome workplace like no other game company I know of. They are already drowning in job applications from people who actively try to shape their CV to be a good applicant to them. They have the luxury to hire the 0,0001%.<p>I'm German, haven't finished my studies at non-famous universities and probably won't for a while since i'm working 75% of my time as a freelancer to support myself. I haven't worked professionally on any gaming project, my 3D Math skills are basic and most of my professional experience is in web projects working with Java, Javascript and PHP, although I've worked on 3D Stuff in C++ (Good old Irrlicht Engine!) when i was younger.<p>As much as i like the idea of not pre-rejecting yourself, there is a line to be drawn at the point where an application in itself bothers someone else simply because it's unrealistic and the rejection produces unnecessary work.<p>-----------8<-----------<p>Now, shut up, stop worrying about creating unnecessary work for Michael, stop making excuses and send that email.<p>Don't make me think that taking the time to write this reply was unnecessary work. :)<p>If you have a positive response you can buy one of my Bright Bunnies in appreciation: <a href=""http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10708"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10708</a> (Note the subtle self-promotion?

Crockford is the developer of JSMin, and was explicitly dragged into the conversation because people claim (possibly correctly) that it is a bug in JSMin than when it is given code with semi-colons that are missing in places that the JavaScript specification claims are optional (possibly also stupidly), it generates output that is not semantically equivalent to the original code.<p>Your statement thereby makes no sense: this is precisely the kind of argument and conversation--a bug report from a user that itself can be construed as a question about what the purpose of the project is and what parts of the specification it will choose to support--that one would hope the primary maintainer of a project should be ""wasting his time"" involving himself with.",1334465721

The parser sure can.

It would be nice if this would auto-download and get synced up to my other devices - especially for things like bills, statements, etc.<p>But I tend to think that's a corner case (email based subscriptions notifications that need to be delivered by non-email means) - we already have tech to do this, between Microformats, RSS feeds with enclosures, and other established attachment formats like vCard and [v|i]Cal.  I'm thinking that building on those rather than inventing new and arbitrary JSON syntax to enclose via MIME is probably a better long term strategy.<p>I also see the distinct possibility of abusive, antisocial behavior.

It's about removing ambiguity and visual clutter with a simple set of rules.<p>How many JS programmers know the difference between a function expression or declaration, and the semi-colon that should follow or not?

It's interesting that it even existed, though. The idea, today, that a videogame company could host a basic-research lab like Bell Labs, MSR, etc., headed by a prominent researcher (Alan Kay was near the top of his fame at the time) seems almost absurd. Google hired Peter Norvig to head up a corporate research lab, but it's hard to imagine Ubisoft or EA doing something like that.<p>My favorite not-implemented Atari Labs memo, fwiw, was Brenda Laurel's suggestion that they design games for dolphins and humans to play together: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/snippets/laurel82_dolphinvideogame.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/snippets/laurel82_dolphinvideogame.html</a>",1334464369

Make downvoting take away karma of the OP too, thus making people put more thought into their posts.

Downvoting siphons votes/karma from the system, we need a way to introduce additional karma/votes into the system. Maybe a monthly replenish method where say everyone gets 10 votes each month.

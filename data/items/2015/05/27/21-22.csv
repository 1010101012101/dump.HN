In theory, federal law is restricted to addressing the things enumerated in the Constitution. In practice, one of those is regulating interstate commerce, which since [1] has steadily increased in scope.

And since there is no upcoming &quot;event&quot; to force an appeals process (aka execution), it will just never happen.  Is that really a better fate for someone wrongfully accused?  If you are sentencing them to life in a cage, be honest and call it a death penalty.<p>So sure you can save some money by getting rid of the death penalty, but it is not likely to make Justice any better served, it will just make you feel better and leave people in prison forever without a guaranteed appeals process.",1432763961

For most purposes it is very thorough at finding defects in non-cryptographic hash function designs. A strong design has good statistical properties regardless of the types of key sets and SMHasher tests many kinds of key sets, including several that are designed to be pathological.<p>There are two caveats with using SMHasher to be aware of.<p>First, it does not thoroughly exercise the internals of some hash function constructions that you sometimes see in larger hashes. You can modify the source to add this coverage but it is not there by default.<p>Second, the speed test implementation is broken. It is good enough to give you a rough idea of what is going on for bulk hashing relative to other algorithms, but the absolute performance measurement deviate from proper testing by a significant amount (up to 20-25% anecdotally). Also really fast small key algorithms can be significantly off. Basically, performance is measured using a method that Intel&#x27;s performance measurement documentation strongly advises to not do.

9614641,comment,9611710,9611710,0,0,haberman,,,"Let me see if I have this straight. My understanding is that WTF-8 is identical to UTF-8 for all valid UTF-16 input, but it can also round-trip invalid UTF-16. That is the ultimate goal.<p>Below is all the background I had to learn about to understand the motivation/details.<p>—<p>UCS-2 was designed as a 16-bit fixed-width encoding. When it became clear that 64k code points wasn’t enough for Unicode, UTF-16 was invented to deal with the fact that UCS-2 was assumed to be fixed-width, but no longer could be.<p>The solution they settled on is weird, but has some useful properties. Basically they took a couple code point ranges that hadn’t been assigned yet and allocated them to a “Unicode within Unicode” coding scheme. This scheme encodes (1 big code point) -> (2 small code points). The small code points will fit in UTF-16 “code units” (this is our name for each two-byte unit in UTF-16). And for some more terminology, “big code points” are called “supplementary code points”, and “small code points” are called “BMP code points.”<p>The weird thing about this scheme is that we bothered to make the “2 small code points” (known as a “surrogate” pair) into real Unicode code points. A more normal thing would be to say that UTF-16 code <i>units</i> are totally separate from Unicode code <i>points</i>, and that UTF-16 code <i>units</i> have no meaning outside of UTF-16. An number like 0xd801 could have a code <i>unit</i> meaning as part of a UTF-16 surrogate pair, and <i>also</i> be a totally unrelated Unicode code <i>point</i>.<p>But the one nice property of the way they did this is that they didn’t break existing software. Existing software assumed that every UCS-2 character was also a code point.  These systems could be updated to UTF-16 while preserving this assumption.<p>Unfortunately it made everything else more complicated. Because now:<p>- UTF-16 can be ill-formed if it has any surrogate code units that don’t pair properly.<p>- we have to figure out what to do when these surrogate code points — code points whose only purpose is to help UTF-16 break out of its 64k limit — occur outside of UTF-16.<p>This becomes particularly complicated when converting UTF-16 -> UTF-8. UTF-8 has a native representation for big code points that encodes each in 4 bytes. But since surrogate code points are real code points, you could imagine an alternative UTF-8 encoding for big code points: make a UTF-16 surrogate pair, then UTF-8 encode the two code points of the surrogate pair (hey, they are real code points!) into UTF-8. But UTF-8 disallows this and only allows the canonical, 4-byte encoding.<p>If you feel this is unjust and UTF-8 should be allowed to encode surrogate code points if it feels like it, then you might like Generalized UTF-8, which is exactly like UTF-8 except this is allowed. It’s easier to convert from UTF-16, because you don’t need any specialized logic to recognize and handle surrogate pairs. You still need this logic to go in the other direction though (GUTF-8 -> UTF-16), since GUTF-8 can have big code points that you’d need to encode into surrogate pairs for UTF-16.<p>If you like Generalized UTF-8, except that you <i>always</i> want to use surrogate pairs for big code points, and you want to totally disallow the UTF-8-native 4-byte sequence for them, you might like CESU-8, which does this. This makes both directions of CESU-8 <-> UTF-16 easy, because neither conversion requires special handling of surrogate pairs.<p>A nice property of GUTF-8 is that it can round-trip any UTF-16 sequence, even if it’s ill-formed (has unpaired surrogate code points). It’s pretty easy to get ill-formed UTF-16, because many UTF-16-based APIs don’t enforce wellformedness.<p>But both GUTF-8 and CESU-8 have the drawback that they are not UTF-8 compatible. UTF-8-based software isn’t generally expected to decode surrogate pairs — surrogates are supposed to be a UTF-16-only peculiarity. Most UTF-8-based software expects that once it performs UTF-8 decoding, the resulting code points are real code points (“Unicode scalar values”, which make up “Unicode text”), <i>not</i> surrogate code points.<p>So basically what WTF-8 says is: encode all code points as their real code point, <i>never</i> as a surrogate pair (like UTF-8, unlike GUTF-8 and CESU-8). However, if the input UTF-16 was ill-formed and contained an unpaired surrogate code point, <i>then</i> you may encode that code point directly with UTF-8 (like GUTF-8, not allowed in UTF-8).<p>So WTF-8 is identical to UTF-8 for all valid UTF-16 input, but it can also round-trip invalid UTF-16. That is the ultimate goal.",1432763641

A car manufacturer shouldn&#x27;t worry about crash-testing or other safety concerns, only that their car moves?<p>HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?!?!<p>Like it or not, we&#x27;re stuck on Von Neumann architecture, and as a result, data can be treated as code and vice-versa. The consequence of this is that, under certain circumstances, data can be carefully crafted to act as code, and can be executed in an unforeseen context. As a software engineer, <i>it is your job</i> to take precautions when developing software. Precautions that prevent this execution. Security people do the best they can to make it easy to develop safely, but all of that is <i>useless</i> if the developers ignore it. And, because security vulnerabilities are a manipulation of context-and-program-specific control flow, there&#x27;s not a way to encapsulate all security measures in a way that is transparent. It&#x27;s just not possible. Only developers know the specifics of their software, and only developers can protect certain edge cases. If you assert otherwise, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the systems that you work with, and you need to re-evaluate your education before continuing to work in the industry (assuming you do). This isn&#x27;t an opinion. This is a fact.<p>Lastly, us &quot;security experts&quot; do contribute to our field. Security is one of the hard problems in computer science - far harder than whatever you&#x27;re doing that lets you <i>&quot;not think about databases, deployment, testing, scaling&quot;</i> - and there&#x27;s a lot of solutions that have been engineered to deal with software that has been created by people like you. There&#x27;s <i>static code analysis tools</i>, which can detect bugs in code before it is even compiled. There&#x27;s <i>memory analyzers</i> that can detect dozens of different classes of memory-related bugs by just watching your software run. There&#x27;s <i>memory allocators</i> and <i>garbage collectors</i> that can prevent issues with use-after-free and other heap-related exploitation bugs at run-time. There&#x27;s <i>data execution prevention</i> and <i>buffer execution prevention</i> that, at run-time, help prevent code from being executed from data pages. There&#x27;s <i>EMET</i> and other real-time exploit detection tools that exist outside of your software and can still prevent exploitation. That&#x27;s not even an exhaustive list. There are literally hundreds of tools out there that make finding and fixing security bugs easy, but those tools can&#x27;t patch your code for you. That&#x27;s why there are consultants, code auditors, and penetration-testers that can give advice on how to fix bugs, find bugs where automated tools fail, and even coach developers into writing more secure code; because having smart, security aware developers is one of the major ways to defend against security bugs.",1432763332

So it is not punishment for exercising your constitutional right as much as securing what they worked to achieve and what they wanted all along whereas they were willing to compromise.  The same thing happens in civil with settlements, the suit may seek $10M, they are willing to settle for $5M, but if you go to trial and win you are going after the full amount you original sought even though at one point you would have taken half, that is not vindictive.<p>>intimidates innocent (or even guilty) defendants into pleading guilty?<p>Again this is a major misconception, in most instances of misdemeanors and even in some felonies there may not be a guilty plea, there will be a no contest plea (&quot;I am not saying I did it, I am not saying I didn&#x27;t do it, I am closing the case in my best interest&quot;) and in exchange the Gov will recommend a <i>withholding of adjudication</i> (This is not a finding of guilt, but an acknowledgement by the Court the defendant closed their case in their own best interest...almost a middle ground between guilty and not guilty).",1432761049

They didn&#x27;t know what they needed, and I had no true idea how much work was involved. When I couldn&#x27;t deliver I returned the money (which hurt, but I could do it). The client later came back to me (!) with a much smaller, better-defined project which I executed on well. They became a regular client and have been worth six figures to me over the years. (It did help that they tried another developer in the meantime who also didn&#x27;t deliver but kept the money and stopped returning calls.)",1432760583

If the state does not have a case that justifies the maximum sentence, then the maximum sentence shouldn&#x27;t - and in most countries wouldn&#x27;t be - on the table in the first place.<p>That this is even possible gives US prosecutors strong incentives to dangle the threat of high sentences in front of your clients whether or not they are justified in the interest of pushing your clients not to go to trial. Especially when they face defendants with weaker representation. To me, this does not serve justice at all - it serves to create further injustices.",1432760577

500662,comment,499109,500264,0,0,randallsquared,,,"> how is that extra value imparted, if not from the labor (variable) acting on constant capital?<p>It depends on the value and the valuer.  A thing's value and the labor spent on it are not intrinsically related at all: a wild flower may be very valuable to someone while having required no labor at all.  Similarly, digging a hole in your back yard does not automatically increase the value of your property; the labor has no value of its own.<p>Value is entirely subjective, and can only be measured or assigned by people.",1236031011

If someone copies you then you just have to out do them with better features or support. My feeling, is if you're trying to prevent someone from competing with you, you may win in the short run, but in the long run you'll probably lose.<p>By trying to stop other people from competing against you it diverts your time, energy, and resources to something that could be better used to make your product better. Lets say you are successful and you stop the person from competing directly with you, two other projects might pop up that do the same or similar tasks that your project does. Now you'll have to go after them, ad infinitum.<p>Next, while this won't affect your customers it may affect your investors or possible community which you have gained. Some people may take your attack as being childish or as being a weakness to your person. Your reputation may suffer as an end result and you'll lose the confidence of your investors and the community you built up may leave because they don't like your attitude.<p>It's a touchy subject and I'm not the most knowledgeable person as I've never really been in this situation. However, I've always felt it's better to just push on. Competition is good for you and the customers. While you may feel like it's harming your bottom line, you'll probably end up with a much better product that will prevent a much larger corporation with much more resources from entering your market bruteforce because you have a battle-tested product with a good amount of features.",1236030233

9177375,comment,9177105,9177105,0,0,bradfa,,,"Inside the magic band are 3 radios: 13.56 MHz near field RFID (what&#x27;s in your credit card&#x27;s swipe to pay), 915 MHz passive UHF RFID (what&#x27;s in your timing bib if you run a 5k race or what Walmart uses for inventory tracking), and a 2.4 GHz active radio.<p>The following are my conjectures on how it works.  I do not work for Disney or any contractor, but I do work in the field of RFID.<p>The 13.56 MHz near field RFID is used for payment and entry to the park, and any other time Disney has you hold your band up to something for a transaction.  It&#x27;s near field, so the range is only a few centimeters, which is good for payments and when you want to ensure only one band is being interfaced with.  This RFID consumes no battery power from within the band.<p>The 915 MHz UHF RFID is used for positioning with shorter ranges but near instantaneously.  For example, when you sit at a table, my guess is they are using this UHF RFID to find your location (an antenna at each table gives very good indication of who&#x27;s at that table).  Generally range on UHF RFID is a few meters, plenty to detect who&#x27;s walking up to the dining location if they funnel you through a specific path (called portals in the industry).  This is also likely the technology used to detect which car/boat you are in when they take your pictures on the rides.  UHF RFID can acquire hundreds of tags per second and consumes no battery power from within the band, which is perfect for quickly detecting who&#x27;s in range of a given antenna if they are only a few meters away.<p>Finally, the 2.4 GHz radio.  It&#x27;s active so does consume battery power and the battery inside the bands are tiny, so it cannot be transmitting that often or the battery life would suck.  Hence, I believe that the near field interactions reset a timer which runs for a few days to a week to enable the 2.4 GHz radio.  Likely this radio transmits every minute or so.  Disney do have receivers around the park for this 2.4 GHz radio system and I believe they only use it for detecting rough location of all visitors which is perfect to determine the lengths of lines at rides or to find where a lost kid is in the parks.  Once the timer expires (if you&#x27;ve not interacted with any near field readers in a few days) then the 2.4 GHz radio stops until the next interaction.  This is likely the only way to get such good battery life and how they can ship the thing to you weeks before you arrive.<p>EDIT to add: That 2.4 GHz radio probably has a range of somewhere around 30 to 50 meters (possibly more).  Some of their receiver stations are in the lights around the park (some with wired Ethernet others with wifi or other backhaul RF networking), others are little black boxes with 100BaseFX (fiber Ethernet for long runs like 1km).  This is perfect for knowing crowd density in an area and estimating line lengths for outdoor areas (the UHF RFID could also be used for line length estimation in controlled or indoor areas).  Probably they also have some 2.4 GHz receivers installed in the parade floats and vending carts (along with GPS to know where those items are) to collect data for location tracking.<p>All in all, Disney are executing the wearables and RFID systems exactly as they are best envisioned.  It&#x27;s awesome! (if a bit scary)",1425991340

Being told is passive. Passive defence and active defence are two entirely different states of mind. Defending against an attack needs to be active and instinctual. Every time you open, close, or set down your laptop, a small part of your brain should be thinking about it. In computer security, a single failure is enough to lose control, so it&#x27;s useful to have an environment that reflects that.<p>A simple example is being told to keep your terminal locked. This is a common rule for most workplaces but is usually met with dismal failure. One of the companies I worked at actually made a game out of leaving your terminal unlocked. I can tell you, after a few days of your colleagues kindly laughing at you returning to a screen full of Internet memes, you instinctively Ctrl + L upon standing up, even if it&#x27;s to walk to the windows to look at the view.<p>Why is it important I lock the screen even if standing a metre away? My friend walks by whilst I&#x27;m staring at the view and invites me to [coffee|walk|game|X]. Security has already left your mind and you head off to do [X], leaving your terminal unlocked. Even worse, your screen might auto-lock in a few minutes, giving you a false sense of security when you return. Even if it was unlocked when you returned, you&#x27;d likely get back to work, not realizing your error.<p>Making security a game is a good way of instilling the practice. Colleagues make for cunning adversaries and make you actively defend yourself. This defence is useful against both pretend threats and real ones. Wargames are wargames for a reason.",1425991229

From that article:<p>> 4. [Japanese] relinquishment of Manchuria, Korea and Formosa, as well as all territory seized during the war.<p>This peace proposal was virtually identical to the one Japan ended up accepting. The only difference was that it did not offer the surrender of the person of the emperor.<p>The veracity of this proposal has never been questioned or denied:<p>> The authenticity of the Trohan article was never challenged by the White House or the State Department, and for very good reason. After General MacArthur returned from Korea in 1951, his neighbor in the Waldorf Towers, former President Herbert Hoover, took the Trohan article to General MacArthur and the latter confirmed its accuracy in every detail and without qualification.<p>(Harry Elmer Barnes, &quot;Hiroshima: Assault on a Beaten Foe&quot;, National Review, 10 May 1958)<p>So there is no reason to doubt it.<p>As for your belief that the US was concerned about another war in 20 years, I am aware that this commonplace ideological piece of rhetoric is very well documented. But let&#x27;s take it a face value. Let&#x27;s say we believe that the real reason the US chose to firebomb Tokyo and burn to death around 100,000 people, mostly children, elderly and caretakers was to save lives by preventing another war in the next 20 years. The very least you could say is that it didn&#x27;t work very well: the US was fighting another war in Korea 5 years later, Cuba 16 years later and Vietnam 20 years later. And yet the rhetoric keeps coming back, as justification for every single one of these events. So if fighting wars doesn&#x27;t actually seem to prevent any killings, but always warrants more wars, why not change tactics? Why not try a different approach, for example a game of rock-paper-scissors between world leaders? The answer is that wars do indeed work for the purpose they are fought for. But this purpose is not preventing other wars, as ideology would have you believe, but instead to establish the might of the state in the general competition of states for power and domination. And populations are simply the means by which states achieve this purpose: their own population as productive force for the war machine and canon fodder; and the enemy&#x27;s population as evidence of the state&#x27;s power, in the form of number of casualties. The more you kill, the better.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1945/08/19/page/1/article/bare-peace-bid-u-s-rebuffed-7-months-ago"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1945/08/19/page/1/article...</a>",1425990781

And, I think, you would not consider it unfair to demand a robber to pay back the money he&#x27;s stolen. The problem with underprivileged groups is not the reality of the offense against them, nor the identity of the victim, but the identity of the perpetrator, and this is where study and of power comes in. Because the reality is that human society, like gas molecules, performs many acts not as individuals but as a group (even collective property preceded the invention the first private property), and therefore the perpetrator in the offenses of underprivilege is society as a whole. The actions under discussion are not as acts of nature but acts like for men, acting as a group (and collective action is a positive fact). Assigning individual responsibility is as futile as assigning individual responsibilty to specific gas molecules in expanding a balloon; doing so is just an ineffective model. And what society has stolen as a group (from individuals!) it must pay back as a group. Identifying the <i>victims</i> as a group is just a matter of statistical convenience as well as an aid in the description of the dynamics.<p>That an electron is measured through its effect does not mean that we don&#x27;t need to describe the electron itself. In fact, it is crucial that we do in order to understand its action. Same thing for power: you almost never observe it directly, but its study, and the term itself, are required in order to understand the workings of society.<p>And as to this game, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s inherently bad at all, but if its role in society is not studied it might become an unwilling accomplice to injustice. And, if, one day it is somehow discovered that abilities that convey power are dominantly genetic, I do not think that we should give certain jobs to people unsuited to them, but our society is judged not by the achievements of those born to privilege, but by how it takes care of those who lack it. Exactly how this moral obligation should be carried out is a complex matter in itself, and far beyond what I can write here.",1425989688

They are fast, 50 fps capable games. Your referenced example of the HTC EVO makes it look like a faulty mobile, nothing more. I have no problem running flash on android unless with poorly encoded video or flash 3D api parts that are not supposed to run on mobile flash, but the player tells me that when starting.<p>In practice, to make any other native or not dev plat do what flash does on mobile will hog the cpu/gpu just the same because, simply put, there is no magical free lunch processing. In practice, only native can touch it and in most real world situations that is only done with time costly tweaking that in the end can't really surpass its performance other than mostly synthetic optimal situations.<p>If you run non optimal coded apps made in whatever dev plat, you will get drain. That is possible to be done with flash apps. It's a developer problem.<p>As for flash having more bugs than IE, add some links for reference, I would love to read up on that.",1341154754

Problem with Apple is that if all players will play using Apple strategy we will not have any innovation at all.
Motorola, Nokia, Samsung invested billions in mobile technology without knowing if this will even work, they risked and created cell phones and so on. They had big invest, big risk and at the end big win.
Apple didn't take any risk, they simply polished existing products and started to sell it with much higher price tag. This isn't wrong, wrong is this that Apple tries to block another players using courts. Apple didn't make big invest, didn't take big risk, but takes biggest win by using patent system to force all competitors to give to Apple theirs patents (and when Motorola says, OK we want 2.5% of iPhone price as fee for our patents Apple screams that Motorola wants way too much... yeah, it's only essential technology for mobile phone, so who cares?), without letting them to use Apple's patents.
If players like Motorola or Nokia would use Apple strategy we would simple still using line phones. Because nobody would invent cell phones, the best strategy would be to patent idea of cell phone and to wait till somebody will build it and to sue him.
Patent system was intended to promote innovation, but here it isn't doing it, it is used to block innovation.
Google didn't patent notifications, so thanks to this users of iOS5 may use much better notifications. Thanks to this that Google didn't patent it, users of Apple so competitor product may use it. But Apple patents all small things blocking other players. Apple behaves like parasite on innovation tree, and patent system should  protect whole tree because this guarantee progress and innovation.",1341153009

For example, no one was doing a multitouch screen for a consumer mobile device until Apple. In fact, companies such as RIM where declaring the full QWERTY hardware keyboards were the future of smartphones. So Apple took a risk, a huge risk in fact. So when a company like Samsung (or any in their cohort) comes along and puts a touchscreen on a phone, when no one else was doing it before, Samsung effectively benefited from Apple's risk. I'm not arguing that the concept of a touchscreen should be patent-protected, however the specific technology behind should be.<p>Furthermore, part of Samsung's complaint against the injunction is that the iPad design patent is ""generic"" and should not be subject to protection, yet if it was so generic, then why wasn't anyone else using that design before Apple? Just because it's minimal doesn't mean it's generic. It appears generic because the iPad became so ubiquitous. Coca-Cola bottles are another good example of the logic behind a design patent. The Coca-Cola's classic ""Contour"" bottle, or ""Hobble skirt"" bottle, from 1915 was one of the first glass containers ever to be patented based only on its unique shape. In 1916, Coca-Cola debuted the patented bottle which would help distinguish them from competitors. Even today, that bottle is recognized as a ""Coke bottle."" No one is arguing that bottles should be patent protected, but the specific characteristics that make a bottle unique certainly should be. The Coke bottle is a prime example.<p>Design patents protect that which distinguishes one product from another.<p>If you look at this image: <a href=""http://www.zdnet.co.uk/i/z5/illo/nw/story_graphics/10oct/galaxy-tab-hands-on/samsung-galaxy-tab-8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.co.uk/i/z5/illo/nw/story_graphics/10oct/gal...</a><p>The products look almost identical, although the Galaxy pictured is the smaller version than the 10.1. But really.. who in their right mind can say that Samsung just happened to come up with the exact same design as Apple. More importantly, would the neighbor down the street, if she saw them both together, be able to tell them apart? She's likely say, ""Oh cool, Apple made a smaller iPad.""<p>For more examples of Samsung blatantly ripping off Apple designs, have a look at this: <a href=""http://www.iclarified.com/images/news/20889/74763/74763.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iclarified.com/images/news/20889/74763/74763.jpg</a><p>Samsung copied the exact same green for the phone icon as well as positioned it in the exact same default location as the iPhone.

Of course a tech person knows the difference between a Samsung Galaxy XYZ123 and an XYZ321, but the average person that sees that Samsung product is going to certainly confuse it with Apple.<p>Arguing that this injunction is somehow stifling innovation is bullshit. Samsung themselves are stiffing their own innovation trying to create a copycat product and riding the Apple gravy train as opposed to inventing something of their own. At least Amazon, Sony, HP, Microsoft are/were attempting to distinguish themselves. I respect the vapor-ware MS Surface far more than the extant Samsung Galaxy simply because at least Microsoft is trying to innovate, even if they seem to have a rough time of it. THAT'S what competition is about, not copying someone's designs and tweaking it a little. It's about building a better product than the other guy. Microsoft, and it pains me to say it, is one of the few companies other than Apple that are truly trying to innovate in the mobile device space. Samsung is just another East-Asian mega-conglomerate trying to cash in on someone else's work. In 2010, Samsung's revenue (not including subsidiaries outside of Korea) was $258 billion. Apple's was $63.5 Billion. I mention that because the anti-Apple narrative is that somehow they are bullying poor little Samsung when that just isn't the case. Samsung is the number 2 patent holder by number of patents globally, just after IBM and just ahead of Canon. Microsoft comes in at number 6. And Apple -- number 39. RIM is number 40.<p>To make Apple out as the villan in this saga is ridiculous. Maybe we don't like Apple because their SDK offends us or our neo-hipster aesthetic is offended by the ubiquitousness of their products, but in this case, Samsung is getting exactly what they deserve.<p>People that want to turn this into an Android vs. Apple battle are missing the point of the injunction, nor did they read the filings in the case.

The infringing technology is specifically called out as Android's Quick Search Box, which has been present for years.<p>The Apple patent in question is obvious on its face. Off the top of my head, Google Desktop Search, which was released a month or so before Apple filed for the patent, is prior art. Nat Friedman's Dashboard project (<a href=""http://nat.org/dashboard/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nat.org/dashboard/</a>) represents significantly more advanced prior art and predates Apple's patent filing by over a year.<p>Samsung may be insidious, but that's not the issue at play here.

The biggie is fork(); it's better by far to write scripts etc. in such a way that they stream results rather than iterate and create new processes.<p>So, for example, rather than write a script that converts Unix paths to Windows paths with iterated calls to cygpath -w, instead pipe the paths to cygpath -w -f -. Rather than use pipe-to-sed  (like ""$(echo $foo | sed 's|bar|baz|')"") for ad-hoc edits, try to use shell substitutions instead (like ""${foo/bar/baz}"").<p>Another thing that can be slower in Cygwin is find, when run over very large directory trees. I wrote a wrapper script (I call it rdir) that runs ""cmd.exe /c dir /b"" and massages the output into a Cygwin-style format. I also have the same script written in terms of find, so that my scripts that use it work on Windows, Solaris, Linux and OS X.<p>But I have to say, the biggest limiting factor in me solving ad-hoc problems is composing the tools available, rather than the actual runtime speed of the tools themselves. Having all the Unix tools available makes my life far easier in this respect. They could be even slower, and I wouldn't mind, because I would still be saving lots of time compared to what Windows provides; and my scripts usually also work on all my other systems running different OSes.<p>PowerShell doesn't even support simple fork-join like bash does trivially:<p><pre><code>    for x in {1..10}; do (sleep $x; echo $x) & done; wait
</code></pre>
I use this idiom a lot when dealing with lots of multi-gigabyte files. PowerShell is mostly useful to me when I need to access Windows-specific stuff that Cygwin doesn't do well, like WMI.",1341151772

The tax rate should probably be the same as the individual income tax rate, and it should be the same regardless of whether it is long or short term capital gains, dividends, interest or royalties.<p>My objection is to breaking the tax up into pieces X+Y, and then acting as if the investor only paid Y.

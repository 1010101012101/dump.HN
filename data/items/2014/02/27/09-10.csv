It&#x27;s always a curve, which is usually very steep at one end and very shallow at the other.<p>If the supply of oil dropped by 50% overnight, what do you think would happen? Those people who absolutely <i>have</i> to have oil, and can afford it, will pay for it, through the nose!<p>The price will go up (and up and up!) until we are at a new equilibrium in which only 50% as much oil is consumed by those buyers that are still able and willing to pay for it at the new price.<p>If the supply dropped by 50%, the price will probably go up by a factor of 100 or more, not just 2.<p>Similarly, in the same article he mentions that some NBA players are paid 1000x as much as some others. But are those players actually 1000x better? No of course not!<p>The right way to think of this is &quot;supply vs demand for someone with that particular skill set&quot;.<p>The only thing you could reasonably expect is for a more productive/smarter/better person to be paid <i>more</i> than someone else. But how much more is going to depend on supply vs demand for someone with that skill set.",1393495181

The market could be easily manipulated by a relatively few number of people.<p>On the day the Mt Gox news box, the number of buy/sell transactions increased by ~300% from the day prior, but the currency was mostly stable.  To defend the price level on that day, about $75 million was required.  So it&#x27;s a big bet.  But also minuscule compared to the amount of capital that traders on Wall Street play typically work with.<p>I wonder who is buying it?

The lungs also collapse (atelectasis) in this process, but will continue to release water vapour leading to cooling and ice formation in the respiratory tract. A rough estimate is that a human will have about 90 seconds to be recompressed, after which death may be unavoidable. The low pressure outside the body causing rapid de-oxygenation of the blood (hypoxia) is the primary reason for unconsciousness within 14 seconds.

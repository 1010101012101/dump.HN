Network effects make the calculation of net ""harm"" very difficult.  Thousands and thousands of entrepreneurs (to say nothing of Microsoft employees) have become millionaires thanks to those network effects.  Good things have happened in the world of personal computing that could never have happened in a fragmented world where dozens of vendors were pushing their own 6502 or Z80 boxes with proprietary BIOSes and OSes, or where Linux geeks worked day and night to make sure ordinary users would never be able to accomplishing anything on their own.  Somebody had to step in and harness all of those creative forces in a productive direction.  Frankly, I'm glad it was Bill Gates and not Steve Jobs.<p>Where I think you are wrong is with your supposition that ""IBM mercenaries"" would have roamed around like mafiosi, crushing the PC revolution.  That's what I call moving the goalposts, or more properly, a strawman scenario.  You won the argument in your own head by inventing a fictional world where you could claim to be right.<p><i>Remove government, and businesses would develop their own systems like copyright and patents, which they would privately enforce through contract, private prisons, and mercenaries.</i><p>I'd need to see an example to buy this.  (Don't use Somalia or any other failed Islamic states dominated by other governments' proxy warriors.)  We don't live on the set of Blade Runner, at least not yet.<p>I guess the closest example I can think of would be the medieval guild systems.

Then when it comes time to pay the credit card bill, it's an 'unrecognized charge' and they do a chargeback.

4799335,comment,4799163,4799277,54,0,robomartin,,,"Everything is relative, isn't it?  Most people would live a very good life as the solo driver of a business that did two or three million a year.  As an investor these businesses are probably of no real interest to you unless they can be taken way past this revenue level.  And that's OK.  I think you realize that tons of people would be very happy if they could pay off their home, cars, etc., have one or two very nice vacations a year, pay for their kid's every needs and their college education and maintain a very nice lifestyle during retirement.<p>That being the context, I've seen tons of solo-founder businesses do very well and come up to that cruising altitude with hard work and dedication.  And that's OK.<p>Also, the OP's point on young-inexperienced solo founders vs. older experienced founders resonates with me.  All I've done is solo and self-funded.  I've made a ton of mistakes.  I've made a ton of money and lost a lot of it.  If I were in your shoes I would not, in a million years, hand the keys of a startup to a young just-out-of-college kid.  Business can be brutal.  It is very, very easy to become your own worst enemy.  If you have a small team motivated to succeed because they each own a piece of the thing they are building they'll probably help each other stay on point and get it done.  Of course, they also need extensive external coaching, support, guidance, etc.<p>How many of your startups would have succeeded if the infrastructure you provide (beyond just the initial small funding amount) did not exist?  My prediction is that most of these teams of young founders would crumble under the pressure of doing a business without the team that you put into place to make it happen.<p>Example:  I have a friend who started a very successful courier company.  He now employs north of a hundred drivers.  No formal education.  High-school drop out.  Makes loads of money.  For nearly a whole year he lived, ate and slept in his car as he service this one mid-size client who gave him a shot making deliveries.  He literally slept in his car in the parking lot outside of their offices and workers would come wake him up when a delivery had to be made.  No support system, no coaching, no, well, nothing.  I don't know many people who would be willing to endure such torture.<p>My very first startup.  Self-funded it with $250K I made after a heavy couple of years of consulting work.  My own money on the table.  Had my first kid.  My wife didn't work.  I then spent a year and a half in the garage working 18 hour days --seven days a week-- writing code, designing electronics and everything else needed to get my first product done.  It was not fun, but it was a lot of fun. Weird statement, I know.  Again, I don't know many people willing to do something like that.<p>I am not saying that all solo founders engage in heroic acts of self-sacrifice to bring their ventures to flight altitude.  But I do think that it isn't quite fair to characterize the solo-founder equation as a formula for failure when the vantage point from which this conclusion is reached is one where there's a huge enterprise and ecosystem behind the startups to provide funding, coaching, guidance and all that might be required in order to succeed.  Take all of that away and maybe we can compare apples to apples.",1353195573

We've found that under the existing chargeback system only 21% of claims are decided in the merchant's favour.<p>We started ChargeBack.cc with the aim to level the playing field a little more. Under the existing chargeback system in most cases the merchant receives very little information about what has gone wrong and who the customer is. Our aim is to use data to help merchants resolve chargebacks with less cost to themselves. By keeping the chargeback outside of the banking system we take away a lot of risk and cost from fee, fines etc... so that's one step. The next step is to give merchants the tools to provide the best response to the customer.

I remember being able to pick any old box (486, ancient pizza box sparcstations) and being able to set up a OpenBSD firewall on it pre/post ipf debacle. Recently I have ran into a number of boxes that I could not get openbsd to boot on, most recently two older shuttle boxes. Hardware support is what really troubles me.<p>On a completely unrelated note I think too many people overlook the contributions of the OpenBSD development team when it comes to Openssh. On a much lesser scale they have also given a lot to the OSS community with OpenNTP. For clock synchronization you have the ntp reference implementation, openntp and Miroslav's chrony. For desktop machines the reference implementation leaves a lot to be desired (especially when it comes to power saving) and or is massive overkill for the problem at hand. Unfortunately chrony seems to be the only clock synch tool that is mindful of power saving and suspend/hibernation. OpenNTP synchs clocks with acceptable accuracy for common use cases without running <i>a ton of code</i> that only a few people fully understand.",1353194696

4799275,comment,4798381,4798960,29,0,mdasen,,,"The issue is one of lock-in.  I think that we here on HN are a reasonable bunch.  It's why I like this community.  We don't begrudge our local pizza place earning profit off of us for providing us with a service.  Similarly, we don't mind people in our own industry earning profit in exchange for a service.<p>However, when a business involves network effects, the morality changes.  If WordPress.com started charging exorbitant fees, cutting off functionality, or putting annoying ads everywhere, I could simply move my blog to any number of other hosts or self-host it and none of my readers would be any the wiser.  However, Twitter grew because it offered this liberal, API-driven architecture that allowed tools to flourish and whatnot.  Now, we're feeling like we're in a bait-and-switch moment and we can't leave because our followers have followed us on Twitter.  If we left, we could no longer connect with them.  We're stuck and unless Twitter does something so crappy that we're willing to start over, we have to live with it.<p>Heck, if Twitter was like this from the beginning, would a competitor have gotten the growth that we gave Twitter?  Let's say that Twitter and Jaiku committed to a 15-year feature set as part of a community promise in 2006.  Twitter told us as users and prospective users (before we built large follower networks) that they were going to shut down third party access and plaster ads over the feeds while Jaiku told us that they would commit to ensuring third party access, but might run ads.  Would we have looked at Twitter and Jaiku and given Jaiku the growth and network?<p>I know it's unreasonable to ask a company to commit to a 15 year feature set.  I'm not suggesting that we have any rights to force Twitter to act how we deem proper.  However, when a company creates a lock-in system (like Twitter does with followers) and they perform a bait-and-switch, I think we do have the right to be mildly annoyed and to point out that this might not be the most moral way of acting.<p>Lock-in allows companies to act against their users in a way we should be against.  That doesn't mean we're against profit.  For example, there was a pizza place near me that offered a large cheese pizza for $5.  It wasn't especially good pizza, but it was $5 and my roommate and I loved it for that.  Later, they raised the price to $7.80 (IIRC).  I assume it wasn't so profitable at $5.  However, at nearly $8, we felt we'd rather pay an additional couple dollars to get better pizza.  We didn't begrudge the store their price hike.  We didn't feel they owed us cheap pizza.  Why?  Because they held no power over us.  We could re-make our decision as things changed.<p>For those of us using Twitter, we can't re-make that decision.  Twitter got some of us to use their service because of things they're now taking away.  Maybe other competitors would have had more traction if Twitter acted this way from the start.  But they locked us in and then acted in a way inconsistent to what got them the lock-in.  That's bad.  It isn't take to the streets bad.  It isn't quit the service bad.  But it is bad enough to blog and/or comment about.<p>The issue isn't that we want to deny Twitter the ability to profit.  The issue is that Twitter locked us in and now we feel like we don't have other options for that style of communication.  Twitter has become a sort-of monopoly over that type of communication and they might start using that monopoly power not to merely become profitable, but to become more profitable than a competitive market would allow - at our expense.<p>In some ways, it's tough to be a monopolist.  Everyone gets to take shots at you.  In a competitive market, people generally don't take shots so much because they don't care: they'll just move along to something else that makes them happy.  Twitter's changes are making some people unhappy.  Maybe no other service could be profitable doing less - that is entirely possible. It's entirely possible that Twitter is being as awesome as possible and that they're nearly saintly in their devotion to their users needs - as much as is humanly and technologically possible.  However, we don't and won't know that because of Twitter's lock-in and because of that lock-in, these changes might not feel like Twitter trying to merely continue along and earn a modest profit for its investors, but an exercise of power over us.  That sounds more dramatic than I meant it to.  I mean, it's Twitter, not the heart surgery that someone needs.  Still, it's annoying when we feel someone isn't dealing with us in a square way.  When there are loads of competitors, we can say ""well, it just costs about that much to get me a pizza.""  When there's only one competitor, we become less forgiving because monopoly power has been levied against us in the past to our detriment.  There are loads of alternatives to 37signals' products.

He built Carsonified on the foundation of simple workshops he ran, he built ThinkVitamin on the foundation of Carsonified and he built Treehouse on the combination of both of them.<p>I say that not as a critic but as an admirer. I think he's done a first class job of building his reputation, wealth, influence and expertise through all of these.<p>However I think it's somewhat disingenuous for Ryan to state that because he has done Treehouse on his own, ""so too can you"". It's what the people want to hear and it will bring the enthusiasm of the bulk of HN readers who are going it alone.<p>However the risk for most startups is not that they will exit for millions and the CEO will only own a paltry 20% of the company rather than 70%. It's that they will die. It has taken me many years to realise it but the presence of a true co-founder dramatically reduces this likelihood.<p>It feels odd writing this all these years later because I knew Ryan at the very start of my career and almost the start of his. I then was a single-founder, he was working with Gill. I feel like we've passed each other going the opposite direction.<p>I gave only a small fraction of equity to my first co-founder and paid a high price for that. I have now come full circle and realise the importance of a good co-founder and of an even split between you.<p>Ryan is right in that he can do it without a co-founder. However if you fit that mold you probably already know that and are running a business quite possibly as the sole influencer already. If you don't then I think there is good reason for the astonishing faith of the valley in the co-founder. There is a degree of group-thought, sure but there are a lot of very, very sound reasons not to go it alone.",1353193876

The 5.2 song is about these problems with upstream and confusing Linux for posix, the ""liner notes"" for <i>""Aquarela do Linux!""</i>:<p><i>""Just as the original song professed its love for Brazil, ""World, you'll love my Linux"" is the passionate call of an idealistic dreamer who can't bear the thought of software that will only run under Windows, and yet loves the situation with software that will only run under particular Linux distributions.\nThis problem has proliferated itself into the standards bodies, with Posix adopting Linuxisms ahead of any other variant of Unix.<p>Posix and Unix have made it where you can write reasonably portable software and have it compile and run across a multitude of platforms. Now this seems to be changing as the love for Linux drives the standards bodies into accepting everything Linux, good and bad.<p>We also are faced with groups writing software that only works with particular distributions of Linux. From this we get software that not only isn't very portable, but often not particularly stable. Our idealistic dreamer in the song loves running one, or more than one distribution of Linux for a particular purpose. Unfortunately, the rest of us are left with the unattractive choice of doing the same, or relying on herculean efforts to port software that is being actively developed in a way to discourage porting it to other platforms.""</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://openbsd.org/lyrics.html#52"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbsd.org/lyrics.html#52</a>",1353193810

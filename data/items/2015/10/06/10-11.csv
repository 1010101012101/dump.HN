When you have your module defined that way, you can think of exposing it as a microservice because this may make sense for your use case.<p>Imagine that each Python module runs as a microservice. For many modules this would lead to huge performance degradation, for example a regexp module can be called thousands times per second, the running time of a call is usually short and replacing an in-process call with a network call will give 100-1000x slowdown.<p>But if you take a different use case of the same module - complex regexps running on large texts, potentially causing out-of-memory errors, then packing the module into a microservice can make sense - separate processes can have large caches, an out-of-memory error terminates an instance of a microservice only and not the calling process.<p>Generally I think the advice should be to always use source code modules in the first place, and create microservices using these modules for specific use cases only involving runtime needs like caching, fault tolerance, scalability.",1444128937

I want now to address &quot;Napoleon was oldest the attribution I could find.&quot;<p>There are two aspects to &quot;oldest attribution&quot;; one is to when the attribution was made, and the other is the era that the attributed person lived. They should not be confused.<p>If I say that Socrates said &quot;a broken clock is right twice a day&quot;, then this is a recent attribution to someone who lived a long time ago. If others then follow my lead, then there will be a lot of modern citations to someone who lived thousands of years ago. That doesn&#x27;t mean it would be correct.<p>This means one can&#x27;t simply order the list of attributed people and pick the person who lived first. That might be a false attribution. For example, <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125169095"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1251690...</a> describes some of the quotes falsely attributed to Lincoln, and <a href=""http://shannonselin.com/2014/07/10-things-napoleon-never-said/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shannonselin.com/2014/07/10-things-napoleon-never-sai...</a> lists quotes attributed to Napoleon, but which he either did not say or did not originate.<p>One way to help identify misattributed quotes is to look in the historical record. Sometimes people 50 years ago quoted unknown person X as the source of a quote, where people now quote older and more famous person Y.<p>Because of the tendency to attach quotes to a more famous person, this would suggest - though surely not prove - that the attribution to Y is incorrect.<p>In the early 1970s you can see many people name diverse sources to the quote, including Haley, author of &quot;Roots&quot;. As Napoleon&#x27;s writing are well-known and studied, the lack of a citation during that to Napoleon is a strong indicator that he did not make the quote in any citeable fashion.<p>(Eg, the shannonselin.com link points out Napoleon may have said &#x27;Not tonight, Josephine&#x27;; we just don&#x27;t have citeable evidence for it.)",1444128505

When I asked people who I knew could have influenced my promotion to not happen, she just said &quot;I blocked it because despite being by far the strongest technically, your behavior negates most, if not all, the value you can add to the team.&quot; The next week, she was going to my manager telling him he _has_ to promote me.<p>She&#x27;s probably one of the person who had the best impact on my career so far (I was 31, so my career was closer to the beginning than to its end.<p>Another person that was extremely helpful in the same period of time was a coworker who joined as a tech lead 2 years before my promotion got rejected. His title was above mine even though I was technically stronger than him. He had no problem acknowledging it but also that his people skills were putting mine to shame. We had the most honest discussions about both skill-sets and while we were brutal with each other more often than not we became very good friend. I&#x27;m a bit frustrated by the fact that I don&#x27;t think he got as much out of our relationship than I did, but I think it was more coming from his own shame than from my behavior.<p>A third was a person out of work that had been classified as &quot;gifted&quot; as a kid. He used to introduce me as a &quot;genius&quot; to people around me. I hated that but it got me thinking.<p>Anyway, coming from the other side, there were a couple of things driving my judgement :<p>- I thought I was normal and that anyone not performing to my level was just stupid. And that was making me angry towards others. The third person  made me realize that maybe I wasn&#x27;t normal (sorry if that sounds very pretentious), which means others are not stupid. They&#x27;re actually quite smart, just not the same way I am. And my responsibility is to help them gain the insight I have, granted they want to.<p>- I didn&#x27;t feel recognized enough. The 1st person made it brutally obvious that people saw what I could do and the only reason why they couldn&#x27;t let me know what they saw was because I didn&#x27;t let them. I was trying to prove myself all the time through the wrong behaviors, which just became an infinite loop of mutual deception.<p>- I felt lonely and frustrated. The 2nd person made me aware of my own shortcomings and also offered me both a mentor and a mentee with which I could share insight, transfer knowledge and ask questions, expecting nothing but the cold harsh truth.<p>If this colleague is the only thing that would drive your change of job, I would take that as a last resort option. You should not have to leave a job you are happy/content about because of a single person, so I&#x27;ll take 4 out of the equation.<p>As said by other comments, going to HR is a waste of time. Nothing to gain there IMO. It&#x27;s a human relationship issue that won&#x27;t be solved by someone you&#x27;ve never seen around and that basically considers all of you as a liability. (Not all of HR is like that, but that&#x27;s a big part of their job)<p>I think going to your manager is not a bad idea. if you come to him with a &quot;I feel like&quot; rather than a &quot;it&#x27;s his fault&quot; approach, it should at least get him thinking. &quot;I feel like XX is unapproachable/angry at others/aggressive all the time and I&#x27;m not sure howto approach him and make him an ally and learn from him&quot;. It&#x27;s his job to advise you, to ask around and to advise this person if the feeling you have is shared by your other colleagues. If he breaks confidentiality and that backfires on you, I&#x27;d suggest changing managers. You cannot trust him with your career.<p>Go above your manager only if you are closer to your n+2 than to your manager. There&#x27;s only so much he will be able to do without engaging your manager in the loop.<p>Try &quot;confronting&quot; him. Not so much in an aggressive way, but by using your soft skills. Praise him a bit for the things he really is better at you than you are. Learn from him. Don&#x27;t hesitate to ask him for his opinion/advice/how he got there. And if you can build a connection, tell him about his own shortcomings in the areas where you are better than him. If there&#x27;s no such area, use him to learn where he&#x27;s better at than you are. You might be able to learn what he seems to know without having to put all the effort he put in it rather than his social skills. He will probably sound like an insufferable jerk from time to time, but what you&#x27;ll get out of him might be worth thousand times the 30 minutes of jerkiness and self satisfaction you had to suffer through.<p>Good luck. I still feel bad about my past behavior but I&#x27;ve grown so much since then that I can only be thankful to all the people who had to suffered through this coming from me.",1444127616

If you&#x27;re in the SaaS space already and it&#x27;s not a greenfield project, it&#x27;s orders of magnitude better to deploy lots of smaller identical monoliths than it is to try and build and deploy lots of services and manage the contracts and complexity between them.<p>Major problems I&#x27;ve seen are: per transaction performance sucks due to the network or IPC channels, development friction, logical complexity, infrastructure complexity, managing contracts between services, debugging failures, monitoring performance, bootstrapping new staff and the biggest of the lot: headspace.<p>If you want to succeed, at least in the short term, just keep your monolith tight and fast and without sprawling infrastructure requirements. Single machine, single process, single storage engine (or database), single messaging system. Then scale that to multiple instances. If your site deployment requires at least 20 machines due to sprawl, you&#x27;re going to be even more screwed when you throw microservices at it, not less. If your application is incredibly complex, it&#x27;s not going to work either. The problem domain needs to be small and easy to consider as it&#x27;s difficult to cleanly extract a chunk of your average monolith into a standalone concern.<p>There are also people with technical authority in many companies who blindly follow the latest fad without real consideration of suitability, risk assessment or accountability.

Well, Not Guilty then.&quot;<p>There is a strong understanding among the populace that a jury is a majoritarian body, that unanimity is a legal fiction, and that juries which can&#x27;t effectively suppress dissenting opinions are failures in their social function, and we demand both extended &quot;deliberation&quot;, and a completely new trial to correct their issue.<p>We even reinforce this understanding in caselaw; A last-ditch effort to un-&quot;hang&quot; a jury is termed an Allen Charge, which is apparently when the judge instructs the jury&#x27;s minority vote that their position isn&#x27;t reasonable while glaring at them menacingly.<p>&quot;<p>---<p>How does a &quot;Presumption of innocence&quot; held by one member, survive that group dynamic?  A juror who is unconvinced by the case the prosecution makes doesn&#x27;t have to say &quot;I&#x27;m unconvinced&quot;, they have to actively fight for the defendant in deliberation, and convince the other people to change their votes, in order to leave the room. The holders of minority opinions are entrained to see themselves as <i>inconveniencing</i> every other member of the jury, keeping them from work and families.  If they do not feel strongly about the verdict one way or another, the ideals of the justice system say that this is an absolute case for dismissal, because &#x27;better ten guilty men go free than for one man to be wrongfully convicted&#x27;, but faced with these social incentives, what do you expect them to do?<p>We&#x27;ve created a system where we may as well tell jurors: &quot;If not all of you believe strongly in the verdict, forget the presumption of innocence and go with the decision of whichever among you has the strongest opinions that are the least persuadable&quot;.<p>If you want a system that preserves a presumption of innocence, switch to a unanimity-which-fails-to-acquittal or a supermajority-which-fails-to-acquittal standard rather than a unanimity-which-fails-to-another-vote standard.",1444126713

From <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/security.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/security.html</a><p>&quot;Our security auditing team typically has between six and twelve members who continue to search for and fix new security holes. We have been auditing since the summer of 1996. The process we follow to increase security is simply a comprehensive file-by-file analysis of every critical software component. We are not so much looking for security holes, as we are looking for basic software bugs, and if years later someone discovers the problem used to be a security issue, and we fixed it because it was just a bug, well, all the better. Flaws have been found in just about every area of the system. Entire new classes of security problems have been found during our audit, and often source code which had been audited earlier needs re-auditing with these new flaws in mind. Code often gets audited multiple times, and by multiple people with different auditing skills.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;Another facet of our security auditing process is its proactiveness. In most cases we have found that the determination of exploitability is not an issue. During our ongoing auditing process we find many bugs, and endeavor to fix them even though exploitability is not proven. We fix the bug, and we move on to find other bugs to fix. We have fixed many simple and obvious careless programming errors in code and only months later discovered that the problems were in fact exploitable. (Or, more likely someone on BUGTRAQ would report that other operating systems were vulnerable to a `newly discovered problem&#x27;, and then it would be discovered that OpenBSD had been fixed in a previous release). In other cases we have been saved from full exploitability of complex step-by-step attacks because we had fixed one of the intermediate steps.&quot;<p>> This isn&#x27;t theoretical: it&#x27;s a direct implication of the claim they&#x27;re making, an extraordinary implication, and one which deserves concrete evidence to back it.<p>Fair enough. Maybe they should change the claim to something like &quot;Only two remote holes (known at the time of the fix) in the default install, in a heck of a long time!&quot; Then again, isn&#x27;t this what most readers would expect?",1444125880

If you incorporate inflation into the 1981 $1 a day world bank poverty threshhold it would be about $2.50 a day now.

So the way people get their privacy leaked is via hacking or other compromises. Saving to disks in a person&#x27;s country of origin is probably rather far down on threats to their privacy. (Yeah, I know, if you host it all on disks in the US, then the FBI can come steal those disks. But that&#x27;s less a risk than a hacking group dumping your DB on pastebin.) And a compromise to the company will compromise the data no matter where the disk are.<p>If countries were really concerned, they&#x27;d mandate strong security for personal info. Not like PCI where technical details are spec&#x27;d, but somehow offload it so that companies must make reasonable steps. Then have enforcement to fine companies that misbehave. Perhaps make it something where companies will want to get insurance.<p>That way, a startup, instead of grabbing everything, they&#x27;ll ask themselves: &quot;Hey, do we really wanna capture this info?&quot; Just like PCI shot a lot of plans to store card numbers and CVV, a strong law could make companies think twice and plan around handling private info.<p>Location of storage devices might end up on the list of requirements, somewhere.

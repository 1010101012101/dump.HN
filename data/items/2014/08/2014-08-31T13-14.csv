The app just gives you some tools in order to help you be more effective, it is still up to you to use them.<p>You are forced to come up with a concrete implementation intention. Instead of thinking I&#x27;m fat maybe I should exercise you are forced to come up with an actionable item. Jog at least 15 minutes after work on Tuesdays, make garden salad for dinner Thursdays. Through the course of playing the game you end up with metrics that you can use to further help yourself. If you are failing a task every time maybe consider that you set the bar too high to start and you should get back to basics. Likewise you can look and see in concrete terms how much progress you are making. Thinking about smoking a cigarette? Now you thin is it worth breaking my 3 day streak? A small nudge to be sure but sometimes that is all you really need.<p>The gamification aspect is brilliant. Increasing those imaginary numbers just feels good. Getting gold that can be used toward rewards that you previously committed to helps from making silly in the moment rationalizations. Well I parked my car further from the mall instead of finding a close spot that extra exercise earned me the right to eat this whole chocolate cake. Instead you are confronted with the best version of yourself who was not currently smelling chocolate cake. On top of all that the framework gives you room to fail.

In London I find the majority of diversity has little integration, instead each nationality gathers in a location and forms an insular &quot;community&quot; mostly detached from the others, which seems to miss the point.  I&#x27;ve met people who&#x27;ve been here for 20 years yet can&#x27;t speak English due to that insularity.  Members of nationality X walking 25 minutes to get a nation X pizza, rather than the Italian pizza five minutes away, only buy nation X products, only from nation X shops, nation based employment, nation based music lessons, and so on. Some preference, practicality, or nostalgia is understandable, but it&#x27;s beyond that.  There&#x27;s polarization, which worsens when there&#x27;s some form of stress.  There&#x27;s no discussion of it because because there&#x27;s fear of accusations of racism in what&#x27;s become a sort of racism witch hunt.  The UK news has recently been filled with news of a Pakistani child sex grooming gang, but the media seem to be referring to them as Asian, which not only is sufficiently vague that they may as well be saying that they&#x27;re from the northern hemisphere, but it also strikes me as even more divisive to be categorising an entire continent.

8249252,comment,8248536,8249161,6,0,Retozi,,,"The flaw with such a strategy is that it does not scale. (We used to do exactly what you described). In a big &quot;eventful&quot; app, you will have way too many events to keep track, and you will constantly be browsing trough different modules to understand the chain.<p>Lets assume the user clicks somewhere, so an event is fired &quot;user-clicked-x&quot; that model A listens to.<p>So you know that model B needs to change as well and you fire a new event type from model A, say &quot;model-a-changed-because-of-user-clicked-x&quot; or a more generic event, say &quot;model-a-changed&quot;.<p>Both will cause headaches, because they require a quite high cognitive load. With the generic one, you have the issue that sometimes you want A to change but not B, which leads to lots of conditionals (all of which you need to remember).<p>With the specific one, you have two events that mean almost the same, but are different. With every model C and D you need to carefully evaluate which event you listen to.<p>In isolation, this is perfectly fine.But if you have 10+ of those things interacting with eachother, it will be a big mess. You will have 30-40 different events, that map out a hierarchical order that you need to track down through multiple modules every time you change something.<p>If you do not abstract the chain away, the complexity is simply too high. You&#x27;d have to keep roughly 15-20 links in your head, which is too much. With Flux or similar patterns, you just have to keep one pattern in your head.<p>In the end it&#x27;s a simple story of abstraction. Your mind can only deal with a couple of different things. If you reach the threshold, you need to abstract. Flux shows one way to do this (and it is only useful if you&#x27;ve reached the need for abstraction threshold).<p>Having one or two short event chains is perfectly fine. If you have 5 different user interactions that have a complex ripple effect through the state of your app, you need to do something, or development speed slows.",1409491975

8249232,comment,8247525,8248406,1,0,graycat,,,"In case I understand your concern, here&#x27;s how I address it:  We like something like probability theory because in practice it works great for saying that some roulette wheel is crooked, for confidence intervals on measurements, ..., for various stochastic processes and their power spectra, e.g., for the 3 degree K background radiation.  Roughly we know quite well what we want in our probability theory.<p>From what we know we want in our probability theory, we&#x27;re essentially pushed into the axioms whether we like it or not.  Or, the axioms are basically what the heck we need in order to talk about <i>probability</i>.  E.g., we want to talk about events, say, event A, so that we can consider the probability of events, say, P(A), the probability of A.  And given event B, we want to be able to consider the new event A or B.<p>So, if in our foundations we have that events A and B are subsets of the set of trials Omega, then the new event A or B is just the set union of sets A and B.  So, we want to be able to consider the new event A or B so go ahead and accept the set theory because it lets us get what we want.  So, basically we got pushed into the set theory.<p>For more, if event A is &#x27;the next flip of our fair coin comes up heads&#x27; and event B there is &#x27;a magnitude 1 quake in SF 10 days from now&#x27;, then we jump at saying that events A and B have <i>nothing to do with each other</i> and are <i>independent</i> so that we know that P(A and B) = P(A)P(B).<p>So, in practice, how do we justify independence?  Sadly, in my view, mostly just intuitively as in the little example of coins and quakes I gave.<p>The axioms ask for a little more than we might, first cut, have believed we need to specify.  E.g., so that we will have plenty of ability to take old events and create new ones, we want the events actually to form a sigma algebra.  Next, so that we can talk about the event &#x27;the coin never comes up heads&#x27;, again we want a sigma algebra, and we want our probability P to be countably additive.<p>What about uncountably additive?  Quickly we see that that causes us serious problems so don&#x27;t ask for it.<p>Net, we really do like probability and its applications, say, to statistics, and the axioms I gave (thank you A. Kolmogorov and H. Lebesgue) are basically about the minimum we want.  Really, we just get pushed into those axioms; if we like probability, and we do, then we don&#x27;t have much choice but to accept those axioms.  Curious universe we live in.",1409491234

Planning poker definitely works, provided you understand the requirements, and by &#x27;understand&#x27; i don&#x27;t mean you have read a spec document, but that you understand the customer&#x27;s business problem and have figured out how the proposed solution aims to solve it. Sadly most large projects don&#x27;t have the time in their pre-sales estimation phase for the team that produces the estimate to build an understanding of the whole problem domain. Paradoxically this low confidence in the estimate will tempt the sales team to cut it even further, since they interpret uncertainty as a liberty to seek the low bound (or even lower).<p>As others have pointed out in those large projects it&#x27;s better not to make up-front estimates and just build as much value as possible for a fixed cost, using agile principles. However, that&#x27;s typically not how large software projects are sold (or bought). Fixed price almost always means fixed scope. I&#x27;d like to know of any large software project sold to a customer in truly agile fashion (no fixed scope determined in advance). To me it sounds like a software development unicorn: you hear about it, but you&#x27;re never the one building it.",1409490528

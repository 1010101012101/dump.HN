(Just pretend that front-page story about how it&#x27;s impossible to bias a coin didn&#x27;t happen.) I&#x27;ve flipped it dozens or hundreds of times and nearly every time it comes up heads.<p>After I&#x27;ve done this for a while, I start saying, check this out, I&#x27;m pretty sure this coin is biased. I provide my data to support the claim. But it&#x27;s an ongoing investigation, so I&#x27;m still flipping the coin, and it keeps coming up mostly heads. Every so often I publish a confirming tidbit, like, &quot;I just flipped the coin 5 times and every time it came up heads. This is even more confirmation that it&#x27;s biased.&quot;<p>What you&#x27;re doing is basically taking that statement and saying, that doesn&#x27;t mean anything, a fair coin would produce 5 heads in a row 1 out of every 32 attempts.<p>Then I do another experiment, flip the coin four times and each time it&#x27;s heads. Your reply is that it&#x27;s meaningless because a fair coin would reproduce this 1 out of every 16 attempts.<p>Another experiment. Six heads. You say it&#x27;s meaningless, because a fair coin would do this 1 out of 64 times.<p>And we keep on going. With each announcement you point out, correctly, that this specific, individual result could pretty easily occur by random chance. And yet each of your responses is useless and misguided, because it ignores all the other results.<p>Setting a new high is not remarkable. Doing it repeatedly starts to get more interesting. Doing it while average temperatures have been rising steadily for over a century is more compelling.

If things don&#x27;t change for people at the bottom, who did they change for - all that extra money has to go somewhere, holding all other government spending constant. Presumably the lower middle classes ended up the recipients of this massive tax hike, in your perspective. But this is just a function of the progressive tax curve; it and the fixed payment can both be adjusted to achieve a particular redistribution.<p>The more interesting thing, to me, about an unconditional fixed income, is that it changes the nature of work at the margin. Benefits don&#x27;t turn into poverty traps if they&#x27;re unconditional. Incremental part-time work doesn&#x27;t come hand in hand with the risk of losing your benefits.

But the logic of advertising as a business model eventually led them to have to reject a lot of the things that early Google held sacred.<p>Back in Ye Olden Days, for instance, that if you looked at Google&#x27;s &quot;Ten Things We Know To Be True&quot; manifesto (<a href=""http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/</a>), you would find a flat statement that one thing Google would <i>never</i> do was provide content like stock quotes and weather reports. Why? Because being the place people went for stock quotes and weather reports was how Yahoo did things, and early Google went out of its way to let you know that it was not going to be Yahoo. Yahoo was a big, messy, unfocused portal; Google was laser-focused on one thing and one thing only, search.<p>But then came advertising, and suddenly the logic that had led Yahoo into all those niches led Google right into them too. The advertiser&#x27;s dream, of course, is to be in every last place where people turn their eyeballs; and things like stock quotes and weather reports aren&#x27;t sexy computer science problems, but they <i>are</i> looked at. So Google quietly dropped that language from the &quot;Ten Things&quot; document and started Yahoo-ing themselves up.<p>Fast forward a decade-plus, and like kudzu, Google has slowly expanded into a million niches nobody back then could have foreseen. It&#x27;s in my maps and my phone and my TV and my car; it&#x27;s <i>everywhere.</i><p>In other words, Google found success by becoming the thing they originally positioned themselves as never wanting to be. Which turned out to be a pretty good business model! But it&#x27;s also one of the hardest pivots in the history of pivoting.",1440093369

10093490,comment,10092762,10092762,0,0,will_brown,,,"An actual drop in average scores is probably attributable to a different phenomenon in law schools.  Traditionally, law schools would teach classes to prepare students for taking the bar exams (which ironically has very little to do with the actual practice of law) and there has been a major push back to curb bar based teaching for a more practical approach so instead of teaching how to pass the bar they teach how to practice law.<p>Additionally, the actual score to pass both the State Bars and Multi-State Bar has generally increased state by state in order to keep the number of licensed lawyers artificially low.  Example, in Florida the passing score is 136 but 10 years ago would have been 131.  Those 5 points are not arbitrary they keep a lot of people out and/or force them to retake the bar at a substantial cost.  Some failure can be attributable to the historical increases in the passing score, but not in significant drops in average score.",1440093339

But, people rarely think of tax breaks as a subsidy so there is a lot of cognitive dissonance on this topic.<p>PS: Another way of looking at it is to consider the Canadian government spends less per person on healthcare than the US government while covering their entire population.  Presumably the US government could do the exact same thing which makes it a worthwhile thing to consider.",1440093142

Not sure if that&#x27;s close enough to HTTP/2 to be comparable, but I  don&#x27;t see how HTTP/2s capabilities will solve the following problem:<p>And that is I still need to wait 100-200ms for PHP to spit out HTML from index.php, 100ms for the client to receive it, and another 100ms for a list of prioritised requests for dependent resources to come back. How is that not a &quot;real HOL problem&quot;?<p>If you treat a request as referring to a bundle of resources rather than a single response then you can solve all that by allowing the client to send a lot more metadata about its current view of the whole package. This frees up the web server to respond with logo.png, funkystyle.css and bloated.js, or a freshness response, while we wait for PHP<p>The only way a user-agent can solve this under HTTP/2 is to request a bunch of related resources it knows it needed <i>the last time</i>, at a low priority, and hope they are either needed, or unneeded but unchanged (as to not waste bandwidth). And you know, a pipelined HTTP/1.1 client can do this just fine by prefacing its primary request with a bunch of If-Modified-Since requests.<p>And sure, you can build a webserver that can parse HTML out of PHP and do HTTP/2 PUSH, but again that&#x27;s a waste of bandwidth if I have these resources cached.<p>That&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s time to move away from a simple request, response and cache model and start thinking in terms of bundle synchronisation and dependencies.",1440093089

In college, I minored in bioethics.<p>&quot;Germ line&quot; editing and production of designer babies as well as genetic re-tooling of already living people is going to happen with 100% probability. Right now there&#x27;s already embryonic screening for certain (mostly pathogenic) traits, but this will be supplanted by writing and editing of desired traits.<p>There are not going to be any long term barriers whatsoever; the future of mankind is one of directed synthetic genetics. There will be roadblocks from the regressive factions, of course, but they&#x27;ll ultimately fail. The millenials will be the ones to start to integrate this technology from the laboratory into normal human existence. Many members of generations that come after millenials will likely be heavily genetically modified, which brings us to an interesting place: the people who are currently being born right now are some of the last humans with fully &quot;organic&quot; genomes. This also means that our future as a species is radically more uncharted at this juncture than it has been since start of the industrial revolution.<p>Opening the door to synthetic genetics is going to also create new gulfs between the peoples of the world, as the norms that different societies have regarding genome editing will be different. Think Indians behave weird relative to Westerners? Well, you haven&#x27;t even met the Indian whose parents decided that his genome would be engineered to be the most effective medical doctor. Not only is this guy foreign, he&#x27;s literally made for a different purpose than you or I. It&#x27;s extremely likely that his biological intelligence and focus will surpass unaugmented people, and that will breed jealousy and hatred. Among certain populations of people, genetic augmentation will be taboo, so there will be a new undercurrent of &quot;maybe he&#x27;s augmented&quot; when a newcomer seems to perform strongly. Weird to think about these small details, but they&#x27;re coming. As I briefly mentioned before, it&#x27;ll be possible to engineer people for a certain purpose. Even right now, the knowledge of the genetics of intelligence is advanced enough to give this a very good shot. There&#x27;s always room for unintended consequuences, but we&#x27;ll wait and see.<p>As usual, the technology itself is neither good nor evil, but the usages of it will serve both ends and likely remake future human generations moving forward. The next thing that comes to mind is price: affording gene screening and editing is out of bounds for most people right now, so it&#x27;ll only be the rich, for a time. Eventually the technology will be cheap and ubiquitous, with most middle class people deciding whether or not to genetically modify themselves and their prospective children broken mostly along ethnic religious/political lines. My immediate expectation is that the major powers (US, Russia, China, and EU) will allow for wild &quot;abuses&quot; such as allowing or subsidizing the intentional genetic extinction of certain undesirable traits or malignancies. Some of the worst abuses will probably occur when a government edits the genomes of certain minorities to prevent them from reproducing. It&#x27;s extremely unlikely that any race of people or any negative trait will go completely extinct, though.<p>Exciting time ahead, to be sure. I really hope that there are people working on viral vectors to use with this technology so that currently living people can have their genomes edited too.",1440092872

I&#x27;ve never felt like I created much value with the little 125-word-and-a-picture squibs that the industry blasts out by the hundred million; I know (because people tell me) that some people like my writing rather a lot and are disappointed that I don&#x27;t hit them with 8k words every Friday.  As it happens, a portion of Starfighter&#x27;s list is folks who are in exactly that bucket.<p>Does that answer the question?  Not trying to be very defensive about this, just trying to help other startups out.  The modal startup sucks at email marketing.  It is, far and away, the highest ROI channel you have and probably the easiest to use well.  You should send more email.  You should send better email.",1440092445

10093397,comment,10090477,10092922,0,0,bcbrown,,,">By being able to construct on-demand clusters programmatically that auto-terminate on completion, we’ve been able to use ephemeral clusters for all our data jobs. For much of the day, we can have very few data processing clusters running at any given time.  But periodically, we spin up many large clusters via EMR that train all of the models that we need to learn.  This usage pattern is neither harder to implement nor more expensive than a serial execution of all of our jobs and matches our preferred workflow much better.  For our usage pattern, this actually represents a large cost savings over a persistent cluster.<p>I recently started working at a startup with a similar approach. My previous company had a persistent cluster in a colo, and I found that to be much easier to develop against and use. It takes a significant amount of time to spin up a cluster, which slows down the feedback loop, and makes the development process longer.<p>I also wonder about cost. It seems to me that if you have enough jobs running every day, at some point you should be able to have them scheduled such that a persistent cluster has fairly high utilization, such that it becomes cheaper than spinning up ad hoc clusters. Have you done any analysis to show that ephemeral clusters are cheaper? Is there a cutoff point where that is no longer true?",1440092418

Many conservatives are right to underline that simply increasing taxes is not the solution. So what&#x27;s the solution? Innovation in new source of renewable or less polluting energy technologies. Both liberals and conservatives tend to agree here but they diverge in methodology. Liberals want to heavily tax fossil and subsidize renewable energy.

Of course, only a handful of them do. Most go on to be decent or bad.<p>Pure hubris.<p>> The main problem is that companies stop doing what they were doing during YC—instead of relentlessly focusing on building a great product and growing, they focus on everything else.  They also work less hard and less effectively—the peer pressure during YC is a powerful force.<p>No, the problem is that it&#x27;s difficult to build a large company.

That means I would expect an error of 5-6 degrees, same as a 2-3 day forecast<p>edit: formatting",1440090072

It would be so cool to be able to &quot;gem install yc&quot; into your Rails app (or whatever) and then have hooks that will automatically keep them abreast of user growth and engagement.<p>It provides really interesting opportunities for them to be proactive about giving help at the right time. For instance, they&#x27;ll be able to setup rules for notifications e.g. when you&#x27;re having a slowing rate of growth, or to send congratulations when you&#x27;ve had a strong month etc.<p>I imagine one of the problems in investing in so many companies is that you aren&#x27;t always aware of problems before it&#x27;s too late. By using software to collect metrics about their portfolio companies, they can systematize how to become aware of and help out companies where they can make a difference.",1440090048
10093124,comment,10093026,10093026,0,0,toomuchtodo,,,"&quot;At the end of a YC batch, the general consensus among the partners is that about 25% of the companies are on a trajectory that could lead to a multi-billion dollar company.  Of course, only a handful of them do.  Most go on to be decent or bad.&quot;<p>&quot;You have to keep up a high level of intensity for many, many years.&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t take this the wrong way /u/sama, but could it be that perhaps business models are the problem and not founders not grinding away for years on &quot;real work&quot;? 90% of startups fail [1] [2]. I am highly suspect of the idea that this is caused by teams not being committed or working on &quot;fake work&quot;. More likely, markets shift, business models aren&#x27;t viable, and so forth. This is not a case of people &quot;not giving it their all&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-startups-fail?share=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-startups-fail?share=...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-start...</a><p>EDIT: Its been proven scientifically that people encounter diminising returns past 40-50 hour work weeks. [3] Don&#x27;t encourage grinding harder. Encourage finding where to exert the most leverage, and hiring best people you can hire <i>today</i>. Quality people + automation leverage (your software) + quality marketing is a solid formula (but not a guarantee) for success. Luck, while no one wants to admit it, is a non-insignificant component of success (&quot;right place at the right time&quot;).<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.lostgarden.com/2008/09/rules-of-productivity-presentation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lostgarden.com/2008/09/rules-of-productivity-pres...</a>",1440090044

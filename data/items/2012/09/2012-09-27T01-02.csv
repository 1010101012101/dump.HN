Perhaps it's because I'm on an iPhone 4, but the loading time that comes with this new configuration absolutely destroys the experience for anyone wanting to find anything. Perhaps when we all have gigabit connections on our phones this card view will reign supreme, but until that point it's a completely short sighted attempt at improvement.<p>Btw, I also speak as a developer who has had their sales slashed enormously due the concert of changes that started in late July. My main title has sold at least a handful of copies @ 2.99 a day for the past two years; that was until the store started to limit the amount of queries a user would get from their search. We have a very sexy icon, and very unique concept for the game. I actually thought the high rate of piracy at the beginning of the app's life was the reason for the continued sales, but after the changes started to take place; sales are now limited to about 1-2 a week, I know it was because of the app icon and screen shots.<p>Anyway, I mostly speak here as a user, and this new App Store has not been welcomed. I miss Steve.",1348711171
4578967,comment,4578059,4578819,9,0,dos1,,,"I agree that the programmer shortage is overblown.  I'm a contractor and am currently putting out feelers for my next gig.  My resume and background are ""very good"" from a recruiter's perspective, and even I have issues getting in the door at some of these places.  The sad bit is that most of the time I find out the job is something a junior dev right out of college could do, and the rate is $65/hr.<p>Along that vein, almost no place is interested in paying for talent.  I consistently get incredulous responses from recruiters when I tell them my rate.  Many companies cap their reqs at $90/hr or $100/hr.  This seems like a decent rate, but a major part of the problem is that the recruiting firm wants to take 30% of that hourly rate.  If the maximum cap is 100, that means the contractor is getting (at most) $70/hr.  Companies either need to up their rate, or cut out the middle man completely.  The vast majority of recruiters I encounter today have a premium LinkedIn account and just spam everyone that matches keywords.  Are you telling me a company couldn't have an intern do that kind of thing for a lot less than the recruiters are getting?",1348711152

None of these things were relevant to the endless property plumbing we did all day.  It just made us feel smart and distracted us from the dismal day-to-day that was wasting our advanced degrees.<p>The window dressing justification was that a smart person gets more done, 10x programmers and all that, but smart people also quit when they're bored, and smart people make boring jobs more complex than they need to be to stop from getting bored.<p>Anyways, after that debacle and now that I've moved to a smaller company, I started giving out a programming test that mimics what we do.

This view is a mistake, and it is this widespread and virulent mistake that keeps programming a difficult and obscure art. A person is not a machine, and should not be forced to think like one.</i><p>This is nothing but prejudice, and, ironically, it is contrary to how we work as human beings.  In any field, we celebrate sympathy between an expert and the matter of his or her expertise.  If we say that a pianist ""becomes"" the piano; we do not regret the dehumanization of the pianist.  If we say that a rider has learned to ""think like"" a horse, we do not believe the rider has become less intelligent thereby.  If we say a fireman thinks like a fire, it's a compliment, not a statement that his mind can be modeled by simple physical laws.  Sympathy is an <i>expansion</i> of one's understanding, not a reduction.  For example, the wonderfully named ""Mechanical Sympathy"" is a blog that will improve your grasp of the connection between performance and hardware architecture without dehumanizing you one bit.  Heck, here's a guy who says he has to ""think like a maggot,"" and he doesn't seem ashamed or degraded in the least:  <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17700116"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17700116</a><p>Is it reasonable to ask a programmer to think like a machine?  Of course.  We find it natural and admirable for people working with pianos, horses, fires, or maggots to identify themselves with the subject of their expertise, and there's no reason why we should make an exception for computers.  It's true that when it comes to usability, for a long time we've known we have to take very strong negative emotions into account.  It isn't an overstatement to say that some people loath and fear computers.  However, as a general principle, it seems to me that any educational philosophy grounded in the assumption that the learners find the subject uniquely distasteful or unworthy is unlikely to be effective.  If someone learning programming finds computers so inherently distasteful that they are put off by the idea of achieving a more intimate sympathy with them, then the long-term plan should be to overcome their aversion, not to try to teach them to understand and control something they are fundamentally alienated from.  Human beings just don't work that way.  Alienation and understanding don't mix.",1348709349

My case is further complicated because I run a multisite configuration and use the WP Domain Mapping plugin.<p>It works in a few stages.<p>WP Supercache is configured to gzip pages to disk. It used to be that you needed to add extra code by hand to support domain mapping, but WP Supercache now cooperates and puts on-disk cached files for each blog in its own directory.<p>Then I put specific directives in a sites-available/ config file, not the main Nginx file (I serve a static site off the same server).<p>First,<p><pre><code>    server {
        listen <ipaddress> default_server;
</code></pre>
The default_server directive means that if another listen directive doesn't pick up an incoming request, it will be handled by this config. Otherwise multisite goes kerflooie.<p>I like my logs to be divided by site, so:<p><pre><code>        access_log  /var/www/log/wordpress/<sitename>.access.log;
        error_log   /var/www/log/wordpress/<sitename>.error.log;
</code></pre>
Getting end-to-end UTF8 on a stack is a hassle because you have to do it in the database (multiple times, MySQL has about two hojillion charset configuration dials), in PHP and then in Nginx:<p><pre><code>        charset utf-8;
</code></pre>
Then the obvious:<p><pre><code>        root /var/www/wordpress;

        error_page 500 501 502 503 504 = /50x.html;
        location = /50x.html {
            root /var/www/wordpress;
        }
</code></pre>
Now for the meat:<p><pre><code>        location / {
            # Add trailing slash to */wp-admin requests.
            rewrite /wp-admin$ $scheme://$host$uri/ permanent;
</code></pre>
The rewrite is just a little tweak. If you go to /wp-admin, Wordpress will often redirect to the home page. If you go to /wp-admin/, it does what you expect. So this rewrite just adds a trailing slash.<p><pre><code>            index  index.php;
</code></pre>
For multisite, the Wordpress coders change the URLs files are served from, for reasons that are simply beyond my mortal comprehension. Anyhow, you need a rewrite rule for /files/ URLs:<p><pre><code>            # Redirect /file/ URLs.
            rewrite    ^.*/files/(.*)    /wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$1 last;

</code></pre>
Then what follows is based on the common config file you'll see on a dozen blog and forum posts if you google around.<p>The next thing to do is try and serve a file straight off disk. Nginx does things in an unintuitive order, so even though this rule is further down, it will often fire first:<p><pre><code>           # Rewrite URLs for WP-Super-Cache files
           # if the requested file exists, return it immediately
            # this covers the static files case
            if (-f $request_filename) {
                expires 15d;
                break;
            }
</code></pre>
The ""break"" directive basically says, ""Oh you found whatever.css|jpg|js? Just serve that up kthxbai"".<p>Now we proceed to determine whether or not we'll try to serve a cached file off disk:<p><pre><code>            set $supercache_file '';
            set $supercache_uri $request_uri;

            # don't interfere with POST events (ie form submissions)
            if ($request_method = POST) {
                    set $supercache_uri '';
            }

            # Using pretty permalinks, so bypass the cache for any query string
            if ($query_string) {
                    set $supercache_uri '';
            }

            # Don't show cached version to logged-in users
            if ($http_cookie ~* ""comment_author_|wordpress|wp-postpass_"" ) {
                    set $supercache_uri '';
            }
</code></pre>
If there's still a supercache URL, we try to serve it straight off disk:<p><pre><code>            # if we haven't bypassed the cache, specify our supercache file
            if ($supercache_uri ~ ^(.+)$) {
                    set $supercache_file /wp-content/cache/supercache/$http_host/$1index.html;
            }

            # only rewrite to the supercache file if it actually exists
            if (-f $document_root$supercache_file) {
                    rewrite ^(.*)$ $supercache_file break;
            }
</code></pre>
Otherwise, give up and let Wordpress grind out the file:<p><pre><code>          # all other requests go to Wordpress
          if (!-e $request_filename) {
              rewrite ^.+?(/wp-.*) $1 last;
              rewrite ^.+?(/.*\.php)$ $1 last;
              rewrite ^ /index.php last;
            }
    }

    location ~ .php$ {
        fastcgi_pass  127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/wordpress$fastcgi_script_name;
        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    }
</code></pre>
From the Wordpress wiki I picked up a few nifty directives to make log files a little less cluttered; I've thrown those in a common file which I include here:<p><pre><code>      include /etc/nginx/clean.conf;
    }
</code></pre>
clean.conf looks like this:<p><pre><code>    # Global restrictions configuration file.
    # Designed to be included in any server {} block.</p>
    location = /favicon.ico {
      log_not_found off;
      access_log off;
    }

    location = /robots.txt {
      allow all;
      log_not_found off;
      access_log off;
    }

    # Deny all attempts to access hidden files such as .htaccess, .htpasswd, .DS_Store (Mac).
    # Keep logging the requests to parse later (or to pass to firewall utilities such as fail2ban)
    location ~ /\. {
      deny all;
    }

    # Deny access to any files with a .php extension in the uploads directory
    # Works in sub-directory installs and also in multisite network
    # Keep logging the requests to parse later (or to pass to firewall utilities such as fail2ban)
    location ~* /(?:uploads|files)/.*\.php$ {
      deny all;
    }
</code></pre>

Rehearsing answers to a questions about what the coolest feature of Rails is won't help you, because I am then going to ask you about a time you specifically used it, why it made a difference in your past project to do it and not choose some other solution, what other ways there might be to do it if that feature didn't exist and if your coworkers agreed with the decision, etc.  In short, I am going to ask you a lot of follow up questions to determine your actual contribution to something, and if I sense each response was canned I will keep drilling deeper until I find you actually thinking about your answer on the spot.",1348708681

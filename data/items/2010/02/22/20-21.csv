Arguably any good programmer should know about it, but I think it's not a very comprehensive check on the knowledge of any one particular individual. Suppose for instance, that the only bit of code someone has <i>ever</i> written was something which required them to get very familiar with the modulo operator, but virtually nothing else. They could pass fizzbuzz, but not much else.<p>Note: The author of the 'non-programming programmer post' saw took my comment down when I had posted it there (which is why I posted it here). Guess there's no knocking of the fizzbuzz test allowed... :p",1266872353

Applications that are no longer visible to the user are NOT ""background"" applications like they are on a desktop OS.  Applications that are no longer visible to the user are <i></i>stopped<i></i>.  They no longer consume CPU resources, but the OS <i>does</i> hold them in memory in case the user returns to the app.  Stopped applications may be killed by the OS, thereby freeing up the memory used by them, at any time by the OS when it determines it needs resources.   Think of it like caching.  The app state is cached in memory so that if you switch momentarily to another app (to answer a call for example) you can return immediately to the previous app with minimal delay and minimal resource cost (ie, the app doesn't need to be re-loaded, etc).  The Android developer docs have more information: <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals.html#proclife"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals.html#...</a><p>The only things that truly run in the background on Android are service process.  These are somewhat like worker threads that are created specifically to handle long running background tasks (like playing music, or downloading data over the network, etc).<p>There is absolutely <i></i>no<i></i> need to go through any ""multistep navigation"" to quit apps, nor do non-visible apps continue ""using processor cycles and eating battery"" (with the exception of course of apps that are <i></i>supposed<i></i> to be using processor cycles, ie, music players, etc. running in a background service process).",1266872262

It's not from the LCD shuttering the light from the backlight, but from control electronics reducing the backlight brightness dynamically. Those ""dynamic"" contrast specifications on some displays are a little misleading.\nOne tends to think of a display having a high contrast figure as being more effective at blocking the light when displaying black (less ""Bleed-through""), but they cheat by dimming the backlight.\nThat may result in small bright areas in dark scenes ending up a bit darker than they should be.<p>With all backlit LCDs, lowering the (backlight) brightness setting conserves more energy than having the content dim the same amount.

I have a graduate degree in linguistics and one of my concentrations is word formation. While it’s true that <i>radii</i> is definitely a plural form of <i>radius</i>, it’s not really the generally accepted plural anymore. (At least, not where I live in America, and at least in spoken language. I’m not sure about Britain.) Neither are <i>indices</i>, <i>data</i>, <i>corpora</i>, etc. Highly technical people like hackers and engineers continue to use the fossilized plurals, because these forms are part of the prestige dialect that indicates to other people that you have been educated and can remember to use non-standard plurals. But normal people do not use these forms—they simply use the standard English pluralization rules because there is no reason not to. The poster who mentioned the relative density of each term in Google’s indexes (sorry, couldn’t resist) would have to somehow normalize the numbers to account for the fact that technical people are disproportionately more likely to be using these nouns in the first place, and so a simple tally doesn’t show the real picture if we’re talking about how the language is used ‘in general’.<p>I don’t have the book with me so I can’t find the exact reference, but if you’re truly interested there is an entire chapter in ‘An Introduction to Modern English Word Formation’ by Valerie Adams that talks about how these plural forms arose in English. They were basically made up by scientists and philosophers during the Middle Ages who felt that any English word with a Latinate or Greek root should use the corresponding root language’s plural form, because Latin and Greek were more ‘pure’ languages. (No doubt this attitude contributed to the fact that they continued writing in Latin in general for a thousand years after Rome was no more.) These forms became fossilized in English because the people using them were educated and therefore part of what was considered a prestigious class. That is, using them makes you sound smart, and that’s why they’ve persisted. By my own judgment, though, they certainly sound more out of place to normal English speakers today than the corresponding standard English plural. (I last read this book six years ago, so this summary is from memory—the details may be slightly different but I’m pretty certain that is the general gist of it.)<p>The reason this irks me in general is because we speak English, not Latin. Unless you speak Latin you probably don’t know how to correctly form Latin plurals, which follow a relatively complicated scheme depending on the class of noun, its grammatical case, person, and number. See <a href=""http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000814.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000814.h...</a> for a discussion. Japanese doesn’t have a plural form—does that mean we should say in English things like, ‘Hiroki is holding three kimono in his arms’? The only reason it sounds remotely acceptable is because you interpret <i>kimono</i> as a mass noun that doesn’t have a plural form (like <i>rice</i>), but physically speaking kimonos aren’t like rice in that they are actually countable. The sentence ‘Hiroki is holding three kimonos in his arms’ sounds much better.<p>Modern English has a very simple pluralization rule. There are three allophones of the plural morpheme: the unvoiced allophone <i>–s</i> is suffixed to words ending with an unvoiced phoneme (<i>t</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>f</i>, etc.); the voiced allophone <i>–z</i> is added to words ending with a voiced phoneme (<i>d</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>m</i>, all vowels, etc.); and the allophone <i>–əz</i> is added to words ending with a phoneme that is similar in articulation features to <i>s</i> and <i>z</i> (<i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>sh</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>j</i>, etc.). There are exceptions to this rule that show extreme resistance to degradation (such as <i>children</i> and <i>teeth</i>), but in general the exceptions are slowly being replaced by the standard plural in normal speech. If someone said ‘Look at all those oxes over there,’ most people wouldn’t blink an eye.<p>Finally, I wasn’t trying to correct the OP. My point was simply that the jokes where you make up a funny non-standard plural are lame. As mentioned in the excerpt from the Jargon File that someone posted above, hackers (and railroad enthusiasts, among others) have been making these same jokes for decades. A variation over and over again for fifty years of the same old joke about a funny fake plural—enough already, ya know? Of course I’m aware that everyone’s sense of humor is different, so I can’t tell someone something isn’t funny because it’s a subjective assessment. So I’m just pointing out that these jokes aren’t funny to me, because the people making them might not realize how overplayed and unfunny they are to a lot of people.<p>And please don’t get me started on made-up fanciful names for groups of animals…<p>EDIT: See also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_plural#Irregular_plurals_from_Latin_and_Greek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_plural#Irregular_plural...</a> for more discussion.",1266870511

Three of the four shouldn't be there. Coming from Google, I can understand the emphasis on search, but it simply doesn't belong in a hardware button. I don't need to search while I'm playing a game, for example. Likewise, the menu button isn't applicable in all situations, nor is the back button. Of the four, only the home button really needs to be a hardware button, and it's not a coincidence that Apple made that exact design choice.</i><p>most android software is designed with these 4 buttons in mind, and i use all 4 of them very frequently.  the search button is not restricted to searching the web or anything, and many applications have some implementation of searching within them.  the back and menu buttons are required in almost every application since there are no on-screen buttons like most iphone applications have (which look different from app to app).<p><i>When you hit the home button, the previous application keeps running, which means it keeps eating memory, keeps using processor cycles, and keeps eating battery.</i><p>oh, you mean just like every mac os application that, when closed by clicking the ""x"" button, stays running unless you go through its menu and quit?<p><i>To truly quit most applications requires a multi-step navigation that is neither intuitive nor well-documented.</i><p>many have a quit function in their menu, or just hitting the back button at its main screen usually quits it.  i can't speak for every 3rd party application.<p><i>The ability to have more than one GUI application at a time on a device with such a small screen isn't as important as some make it out to be, since you can't actually interact with more than one a time.</i><p>on my mac i usually have to command+tab to work with more than one application at a time.  it's no different on android.  holding down the home button brings up a list of running applications that looks just like command+tab on a mac, and allows you to quickly jump between two applications.  on the iphone, doing that (which would require going to the home screen between each jump) would restart each app every time, losing your context.<p><i>In the early days, I was a big proponent of having Apple add the ability to run multiple apps to the iPhone OS, but I've come to change my mind on that. I think most people don't need it and Android's implementation only confirms it.</i><p>ok, then most won't use it.  that's no reason not to implement it.  what percentage of iphone owners use copy-and-paste of text, or holding down home and power to take a screenshot?<p>even if users don't want to keep switching between apps, allowing background functionality is essential for using things like pandora to play music, or a location-tracking application to keep updating your status in the background.  even if you just have to switch into an app to look at a phone number, or look at a map, not having to quit those other apps is very useful.<p><i>The day of my flight home from the U.K., I set alarms on both devices (I'm paranoid bout missing flights). It took me quite literally three to four times as long to configure and enable the alarms on the Nexus One as it did on the iPhone. Add that extra time by the number of tasks you do on your phone in a given day, and it can add up to a considerable amount of time.</i><p>and this is surprising why?  you're used to how it works on an iphone and aren't used to how it works on android.  it would be no different if you were used to windows and switched to a mac.  once you get used to the new method, you'll do it quicker than the previous one.",1266870125

If the 'president' by and large <i>is</i> the government, then the military just does whatever he says. Sure the president is currently the command-in-chief of the armed forces, but do you really think that they would obey an order to take over Congress? But you are proposing that there <i>is no Congress.</i> It's much easier to obey an order to suppress the population (i.e. 'keep them at bay') in order to keep the 'president' in power than it is to obey an order to completely restructure the government (i.e. remove power from Congress by force). Even military coups in banana republics are pretty 'small' when compared to taking power from every Senator and Congressperson (i.e. you only have to take out the current 'leader' and some of his associates).<p>> <i>It was just a thought experiment, vary at your pleasure. How about dramatically reducing the number of legislators to, say, 12? Would that really be much worse?

The real issue isn't that Congress no longer listens to the people, it's that the people feel helpless to do anything about Congress. Most people don't deal with political matters anymore, they just ignore them. Maybe it's just a sign of our country/population being too large to be governed by a single body. Maybe we should take the more Libertarian route and give power back to the state governments with a severely neutered federal government.<p>And your example of a 'democracy' isn't really a democracy, it's a republic (which is what the US <i>really</i> is).",1266870062

There is a huge difference between a mouse and a finger and you cannot just abstract this difference away by pretending that hover is only used for tooltips.

I can think of dozens of very common Flash techniques that will never work with a finger without being re-writen.<p>* Combo boxes that only expose the drop handle of hover.\n * Controls (video) that only appear when you move the pointer\n * Camera controls where the mouse motion is used to anchor view.\n * Animated buttons, flyouts etc.<p>As an example I did a google search for ""flash examples"" which led me to <a href=""http://ziggystudio.com/v1/main.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ziggystudio.com/v1/main.html</a><p>This app has an ""AUDIO"" link in the upper right that scrolls out on mouse over to expose the actual controls.

1143582,comment,1143333,1143333,0,0,gchucky,,,"Really interesting article, and kinda scary. Part of me wonders if we'll start to see small local farms having to ramp up productivity to sell to Wal-Mart and how that will affect the farms. It could end up going the way that ""industrial organic"" has, like Michael Pollan describes in <i>Omnivore's Dilemma</i>.<p>I do think, though, that there is some point where you have to weigh business practices against each other. Wal-Mart may be doing good by supporting local farms and bringing fresh produce to underprivileged areas, but they also decimate town economies by opening up stores and destroying the competition - not to mention how horribly they treat their workers.  I've never been in a Wal-Mart (there are none around here anyway) and the local farmers market is excellent so it's not a concern for me, but other people might want to weigh their options before deciding where to shop.",1266869460

But good on you for (eventually? hopefully?) fixing it.<p>- 2. they don't get traffic is my point... we look at any page that gets over 100 page views in a month and we build those pages out. so, even if you find a page that ranks it will not have traffic. if it has traffic it gets built out.<p>If a person has a quarter million pages that are getting 5 visits each that is still a lot of traffic. Especially when the page has 0 editorial costs.<p>- 3. we are not scraping, we are using search APIs<p>The end result is what people would typically call a ""scrapper site"". It is irrelevant how it is created (if you scrape directly or syndicate from somewhere else that is scraping). The issue is a lack of editorial control (see your page about 13 year old rape) and a lack of citing sources with links.<p>- 4. i dont understand this issue of our widgets (which don't get used to be honest.. it's a failed program)<p>Search engines have duplicate content filters. If the content is within the page as HTML (as you do on Mahalo) then you can often outrank the original source for their own content. You bypass this issue and me mentioning it if you only use an iframe to embed the content in your pages. But if you embed it directly into the HTML (as you are doing right now) then of course it is bogus.<p>- 5. this is simply false... our traffic comes from how to articles, walkthroughs and Q&A. if you want to know what the top 10 pages are they are things like how to play guitar and call of duty walkthrough pages. those things are 3-5k words!<p>I am not talking about your top 10 pages. I am talking about the bottom 300,000 pages, which in aggregate get far more traffic than the top 10 pages do. :D<p>- just lay off dude... go troll someone else.<p>Not trolling at all. Just trying to give you valuable feedback, as you have claimed it to be publicly multiple times (unless you were lying when you stated that) :D",1266869335

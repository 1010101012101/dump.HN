If I am going to a 5 star dining establishment, on a date, I really don't care about the emotion, because I am not interesting in socializing. Now for nightlife, I would want to be around happy people, but I don't know if that can accurately be discerned. Most people are going to say I am happy at the bar, so all bars are going to be happy.",1328029165

I provided the defendant's bank account info, and when he was unresponsive to the police, they withdrew the amount from his account into an escrow account and then cut me a check for the amount owed and mailed it to me.<p>This can probably be a little more challenging if the account doesn't have sufficient funds in it, but I was happy to see that the system worked.

They did recently institute a 2.5 gigabyte limit beyond which you get throttled down to 256Kbps, but for the price I'm paying that seems more than fair).  The unlimited data is effectively unlimited talk time since I have my phone set up to use my Google Voice number via SIP to handle inbound and outbound calls and I'm not that big on talking on the phone all the time in any case.<p>The Optimus V is hardly the top of the line when it comes to Android phones but it gives me everything I want out of an Android smartphone -- the full Google Nav turn by turn GPS functionality (killer feature #1 for a smartphone for me, and the reason I wouldn't trade Android for an iPhone even if the prices were identical -- and I used to be an iPhone user, I used the iPhone 3G for 2 years), tethering of my laptop and/or ASUS Transformer tablet/netbook (killer feature #2) and Google Voice (killer feature #3).<p>Everything else the phone does is gravy after that.<p>YMMV and your prices may vary since the $25 rate is grandfathered in (even though, as I mentioned, I wasn't under any contract -- which is pretty cool), I think the rate for new users is $35.

I have had an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S 4G on the T-Mobile network) since June 2011). It has been frustrating to realize that my ""Android"" user experience is not the same as someone else's user experience, because both the handset manufacturer and the network carrier have modified the phone so that it doesn't behave just like other people's Android phones. I have been on the same network for more than a decade, having brought a GSM phone into the United States from my last foreign residence, and I never felt I had any reason to shop for a different network, on multiple trips to other parts of the country, until I got my Android phone. And my wife has a Samsung feature phone that she likes very well, so I was initially inclined to trust the Samsung brand (I had previously used Motorola handsets, as that is the brand I started with overseas).<p>My experience with Android, which I tell all of my friends about, is that I can't count on usability, I can't count on features that worked well on my last handset working on my Android handset, I can't count on battery life at all, I can't count on speedy Android upgrades (Gingerbread came quite late to this model on this network), high-speed data connections get consumed rapidly by the phone unless I shut down useless app notifications, and I just generally don't enjoy my ""smart"" phone as much as I enjoyed my first ""dumb"" phone.<p>Here on HN, other participants report good experiences with Android phones, some by installing the Cyanogen mod and others by choosing the Google-branded handsets. I'd be happy to hear more stories about what Android trade-offs are the most helpful and pleasant for the user. But for the moment, I am SERIOUSLY considering making my next mobile phone upgrade a switch to a new network and purchase of an iPhone. I don't hear about as much hassle from the many iPhone owners I know as I do from my fellow Android users. If the user experience isn't plainly superior, the Android ecosystem can't count on keeping users.<p>What do all of you think? Would I be a chump to switch to the iPhone, or a chump to stick with Android? When I buy consumer products, I like to feel like I'm enjoying some consumer surplus, not like I'm being a chump.",1328027932

How would you feel?<p>If I was in such a situation, my response would focus on the systematic forces that allow bullying to happen. I would argue to the media that the focus should be on the social pressures that lead to bullying, rather than my online service. I would also reach out to the victims and offer any support I could. I feel that being helpful in such situations is the best course, both morally and for the business.

I'm sure lawyers for online services will be looking at her line of reasoning and considering that she is a PhD who works for Microsoft, and possibly crafting future defenses around such arguments.<p>2.) danah boyd could be correct, which for some strange reason is a possibility that you are not even willing to consider. I mean, what if the stranger danger / sexual predator moral panic increased LGBT suicide? This is a perfectly valid hypotheses for research. Why are you so quick to dismiss it?

Personally, I can't imagine the benefit in ""clearly defining the role of the controller as only reacting to user events"" in a JavaScript app -- that's pretty much a single line of jQuery to listen for DOM events, and then call the appropriate method on the model. Having the same object responsible for rendering DOM elements also be responsible for listening to events on them seems much more useful.<p><pre><code>    > In Ember.js for example, all objects you want to use inherit \n    > from Ember.Object. In Serenade you can use any JavaScript \n    > object as a controller or a model.\n</code></pre>\nThis distinction seems entirely academic, as in the documentation, you show:<p><pre><code>    var model = {};\n    Serenade.extend(model, Serenade.Properties);\n</code></pre>\n... effectively ignoring the prototype chain by copying properties instead, but achieving the same effect.<p><pre><code>    > I came to the conclusion that doing this is only really \n    > possible by writing a purpose built template language.\n\n    [...]\n  \n    ul#comments\n      - collection @comments\n        li @title\n</code></pre>\nDo you worry about the constraints that are entailed by tightly coupling a logic-less template language to your framework? Whenever I talk to folks that are trying to use logic-less templates to build big apps, they <i>always</i> seem to run into dead ends where being able to call a little bit of arbitrary code would make their templates so much easier -- whether it's zebra striping a table, checking the length of the array you're rendering, or what have you. To that extent, things like Handlebars provide escape hatches from Mustache's purity, with ""registerHelper"".<p><pre><code>    > Serenade has no dependencies. It achieves everything it \n    > does by using normal DOM manipulation.\n</code></pre>\nTake care, as ""normal DOM manipulation"" is one of the slowest possible ways to build and render a UI. Do you have any benchmarks looking at how a Serenade template performs versus a more traditional innerHTML-based template of the same view, in, say IE7?<p><pre><code>    > Lets first clear up that CoffeeScript classes are nothing \n    > else than fancy syntax for JavaScripts prototypal inheritance,\n    > and the fact that they are called classes, is just calling \n    > them what prototypal inheritance is used for in 99% of cases.\n</code></pre>\n[Applause]. Thanks for putting that in your post -- JavaScript's standard prototypal inheritance as practiced with constructor functions is just a longer way to say ""class"".",1328027319

It sets pricetags in peoples minds that are unrealistic. When you get down to the fine print, if the app requires communicating to REST service or design work that numbers is out the door even with the advertiser.<p>The second being many times custom development shops don't weigh customer needs with COTS. For example in our shop we many times have customers that come in looking for a web presence. When we analyze their needs, it is apparent that Wordpress and a template will fit the bill and get them to market the quickest. I am not a huge fan of PHP on a personal level, but if Wordpress fits the bill I would be doing my client a disservice to not steer them down that path. I think for quite a few custom development shops everything looks like a custom development problem.

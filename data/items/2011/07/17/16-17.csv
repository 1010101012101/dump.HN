2773634,comment,2772634,2773577,1,0,wdewind,,,"This is a nice idea, but unfortunately in many cases getting the information and power you require to solve the problems is blocked by seniority.  You have to keep in mind, outside of development many many industries are still essentially seniority not performance based.  For instance, if I work in HR and there is something fundamentally wrong with the way we are recruiting, it's not as simple as whip up a prototype, in many cases you'll actually need for someone (ie: a superior) to be fired in order to really affect change.  It's not easy to address important inefficiencies within the company without pointing out that someone is fucking up their job.<p>As for the inefficiencies you CAN fix, this seems like a standard part of any job (and life to be honest).  If you see problems in your job that you actually can and know how to improve and you aren't improving them, that's an entirely different issue.",1310921965

Short of gross misconduct on the part of the employee, they are often quite different.<p>From your description, there is a good chance that your firing was at least in part due to the organizational and staffing practices at the company (your technical skills may have played some role - but are unlikely to have been the sole reason and may not have even been the primary reason). High turnover is often symptomatic of incompetence in the hiring process, poor management techniques or a poor workplace environment.<p>On the flip side, corporations will often be concerned with employees who ""are just passing through."" There's a lot of risk potential in employing a person who is actively seeking another job - particularly if they appear to be dissatisfied and use the term ""hacker"" and has high level access to financial software.<p>As for your professional self-esteem, that's all in your head not in the external world. Some things just have to be learned the hard way, and the ability to recognize which sort of organizations are a good fit - and which sorts are not - can be one of those. Certain personality types survive in corporations and banks, and other types don't.

I know it's a slightly undesirable horse of some kind. Likely this means it's a gelding or a small pony-ish horse. Do I need to have looked up and remembered the three specific submeanings of the word, or that it's a specific breed of horse from Galloway to be able to say I am ""exactly sure of"" the word?<p>I don't think that's how language works, but it's how this test seems to want it to work.

But one of the points made early on in the article makes it seem as if the Partition was entirely Pakistan's idea, and the hundreds of thousands (millions?) of people who died were all innocent Hindus being slaughtered at the hands of murderous Muslims. ""But violence erupted, and it quickly became clear that in the new homeland for India's Muslims, there would be no place for its non-Muslim communities. Pakistan and India came into being at the cost of a million lives and the largest migration in history."" Which is far from the reality; it was a clusterfuck all around, and communal violence was the rule of the day on both sides of the partition line.<p>It wasn't just Muslims in the 30s who called for two separate states. Many Hindus did too. It's true, the most prominent Hindu in the struggle (Gandhi) wanted a single state and tried to (in theory, at least) accommodate the large Muslim minority. For those efforts he was assassinated by a religious extremist.<p>Of course, you hear religious extremist and you might assume it was some Muslim who thought Gandhi was too effective a voice for unity. To the contrary, it was a Hindu nationalist who thought Gandhi was a sellout to the Muslims.<p>This strain of Hindu nationalism that endorses the use of violence has appeared again and again. As recently as 2002 a riot occurred in which a Hindu mob murdered around a thousand Muslims.<p>All this isn't to say the Muslims on the subcontinent are all paragons of virtue and liberalism. They aren't. But the story the author tells is just a pleasant story, meant to appeal to the baser instincts of Wall Street Journal readers. Maybe more than that, it's a story meant to appeal to India's own self conception, where it's as pure as snow and it's those dastardly Pakistanis who've made everything terrible.",1310920977

As late as the '70s, there was an implicit contract between employers and employees. Employees work hard, and in return, employers take care of them.<p>Starting with the '80s and continuing through today, that contract (outside of a select few firms) has been thoroughly eroded. We are no longer workers, we are human resources. It doesn't matter how many years of service we have, the next senior management shuffle can mean the abrupt end of our employment with that firm. These changes mean that there is no payoff in being loyal to an employer. Given that, its no wonder that others see Millenials as being shiftless and disloyal.

As a few examples you could find ways to optimize a system that is inefficient (it doesn't even need to be at the software level), analyze information about your customers, find ways to save money, research ways to get new clients, etc. A side benefit to challenging yourself is that you will find it quite rewarding.

They just made it more difficult, ie didn't bundle it with the Orkut csv file people used to import everything into facebook.<p>And I think that's actually Google's point: They feel Facebook should offer reciprocity; if people can switch from Google to fb easily, fb should be willing to provide the same feature to their users.<p>Personally, I also don't agree with your point: I doubt the option to export your friends' email addresses in a useful file format would get abused, as it's only your friends that have access to it. You willingly added them, and thus gave them access to your email address.

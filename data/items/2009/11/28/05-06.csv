Their algorithims smell of BS and way too many variables go into it to make them have anywhere near their plotted accuracy for 100 year projections.

964865,comment,964266,964385,0,0,etal,,,"A press release from a typical company will throw as much glitter on their own brand name as possible, and usually butcher the surrounding language a bit too:<p>""the new FRISBEE [TM] brand Flying Disk...""<p>If a writer takes this literally, a copy editor has to tone it down or else the brand name will dominate the article text and make it look like an ad, too: ""It's a Frisbee.""\nFun variants include meaningless alternating caps, or a single lowercase 'i' inside an otherwise all-caps word.<p>Newspapers want to use the brand name, not the logo or an ASCII attempt at one; and in decades past, fixing the caps helped comprehension rather than hurting it. They considered capitalization part of presentation, not content. (Shouldn't a brand name survive an all-caps typeface?)",1259387710

964858,comment,962598,962752,0,0,invisible,,,"I was not saying they are in a class of their own.  I was saying that you are grouping ""PCs"" into a category and saying that is all that it is noteworthy.  Well, sure, that huge mansion is JUST a house, but you know so is that one bedroom apartment. Now you could say, ""Windows PCs are great because they are cheap and powerful.  Macs are great because they are stable and thoughtful.""<p>I didn't even imply that Macs are better.  Although I do think that Apple controlling the hardware and software has allowed them a lot more time to focus on the software than the bureaucracy Microsoft has to deal with to help software publishers and PC manufacturers.  There is a lot of stuff I can only do on Windows and that in itself is important to note.",1259386957

You simply cannot claim a regex engine is faster than another with such a poor experiment. It is evident that Boyerâ€“Moore string search algorithm will outshine any engine on that regular expression.",1259386932

This is actually very annoying, it will create folders and files which are not actually required.Imagine a full hierarchy just for an hello world.Where is the sense in it? I personally like to prefer to categorize my own files in an hierarchy which is customized for a particular project.Sometimes just a file and its binary does the trick and sometimes you have to make just a test folder or a config folder.

I just assume that everything I read on the Internet is wrong until proven right. ;-)<p>FWIW, my Google interview was much harder than my two interviews with financial software startups.

Reading on Wikipedia he has also researched ""non God"" religions such as Buddhism - - and he has found out that stuff like meditation (and praying) affects the partitioner's brain.<p>And really, as somebody has noted it above: it's very plausible that belief changes our brains, given that most humans throughout our history have had belief. And research in belief is _very_ interesting and might put light on why most of the humans today believe in something.",1259385055

( <a href=""http://www.getfirebug.com"">http://www.getfirebug.com</a> ) It's how I learned CSS.  If you're interested in the user interface/experience side of design, it'll help you there too.  It's got great Javascript tools.<p>There's a bit of a learning curve, but Firebug seriously changed the way I design and code.<p>Other than that, do what you'd do to learn any other creative skill -- find examples that you love, and dissect them.  Figure out exactly what it is that turns you on and incorporate those details in your own work.  Good luck!",1177538357

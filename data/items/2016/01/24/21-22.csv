It seems that we so seldom get to experience that kind of perfection in software, which is always tangled up and half nonsense. It really is a wonder that anything works.<p>To me, the ideal of &quot;abstraction&quot; in software has to do with this search for unity, on a conceptual level. Unix with its files and processes seems to come pretty close to being this kind of dependable, understandable, cohesive abstraction... which is why I love shell scripting so much. Sure, it&#x27;s not the most beautiful language, but the basic building blocks make sense in some almost timeless way.<p>Digressing further, I&#x27;d really love to work on a cleaner shell language. Like, Perl is an exploration of what happens if you write your scripts in a souped-up awk, but what I really want is a bash for us new kids, with good support for nested data structures, functional patterns, some more clever ways of representing background processes and FIFOs, modules and packages, etc etc.<p>I forget how I got from Heidegger to FIFOs, but yeah, a ready-to-hand shell that works well with common tasks like serving HTTP and building JSON and stuff. I love the Unix philosophy but people aren&#x27;t really learning shell these days... something like it seems like a way forward... composing simple programs... ah!",1453672772

The result is that adjuncts typically teach at multiple institutions, for example an R1 research university, plus a couple of local community colleges because 1 or 2 classes at one school is not enough to pay a livable wage.<p>In regards to credentials, in the US they can either have a PhD, be pursuing a PhD or have completed their Masters, but it depends on the institution&#x27;s requirements to teach (and the classes they are teaching).

This is probably not much of a problem for theraputic use, but if it needs to be administered more frequently, there&#x27;s some evidence that taking an SSRI before taking MDMA will reduce toxicity (don&#x27;t do this, you might risk seratonin syndrome). DXM too has been shown effective at reducing amphetamine toxicity, so it might also help (also don&#x27;t do this).

There&#x27;s plenty of pressure for automation now, and I don&#x27;t see wages increasing as being the final straw to accelerate automation research.<p>It&#x27;s not a question of final straws or dramatic thresholds, but of a constellation of smaller decisions.<p>If I have to pay my workers $X, it&#x27;s worth investing in automation that amortizes out to less than $X.  If workers demand $2X, then two things follow:<p>First, more existing solutions in the marketplace are likely to be worthwhile.  There may be economies of scale, where this would help lower the cost of similar automation.  At an extreme, there may be tools available that could cost <$X if they were being bought by the whole industry, but between $X and $2X in the case where no one is yet buying them.<p>Second, if I&#x27;m considering building automation tools, there are more things I can expect to successfully bring to market if workers are being paid more.  And so I am more able to raise funds to do research into that automation.<p>These kinds of things should lead to an increase in automation as compared to the status quo.  It may not be dramatic, but I&#x27;m not sure it needs to be dramatic.<p>> I expect the group of workers that have negative marginal productivity (or, less marginal productivity than their salary) is chiefly those people that are good at fooling the system into thinking they&#x27;re productive, and not necessarily intersecting heavily with the group of people that would leave under BI.<p>I think that&#x27;s plenty possible.  But note that we don&#x27;t require that most of the negative-marginal-product workers leave, just that a large enough portion of leaving workers be negative-marginal-product.<p>> But this is very low confidence.<p>Certainly, as was my example in the first place :)<p>> how do you protect against a vicious cycle of &quot;inflation->BI increases-> higher wage demand->inflation&quot;?<p>As I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, I think this is a concern.  It&#x27;s my understanding that the result of a BI that is too high for a society to support would precisely be rapid inflation.  I propose protecting against the cycle you describe by refusing to raise the BI level in response to inflation, which lets the (real) BI fall to a sustainable level if we set it too high.  Growing BI at (or slightly above) <i>targeted</i> inflation seems appropriate.  Growing it with <i>observed</i> (or <i>expected</i>) inflation seems dangerous.",1453671613

From the article:<p>&quot;Even while keeping funding for instruction relatively flat, universities increased the number of administrator positions by 60 percent between 1993 and 2009, 10 times the rate at which they added tenured positions. In the old days, different professors would take their turn as dean for this or that and then happily escape back to scholarship and teaching. Now the administration exists as an end in itself and a career path disconnected from the faculty and pursuit of knowledge. Writing a few years ago for this publication, the Johns Hopkins professor Benjamin Ginsberg described colleges and universities as now being “filled with armies of functionaries—vice presidents, associate vice presidents, assistant vice presidents, provosts, associate provosts, vice provosts, deans, deanlets, and deanlings, all of whom command staffers and assistants—who, more and more, direct the operations of every school.” So while college tuition surged from 2003 to 2013 by 94 percent at public institutions and 74 percent at private, nonprofit schools, and student debt has climbed to over $1.2 trillion, much of that money has been going to ensure higher pay for a burgeoning legion of bureaucrats.&quot;",1453671004

When I actually go and read the stories behind your links, what you state is that 13 people in 10 years abusing their position at the NSA to spy on their significant others (and subsequently being fired, resigning or being relieved of their positions[1]) is a stone&#x27;s throw away from having a federal agent being assigned to watch me personally have intercourse.  This says to me that the average American should be about as worried about being spied on by the NSA as they are worried about being struck by lightning on a clear day. The odds might go up slightly if they had a jealous ex working at the NSA.<p>I have better odds of getting shot by a government agent than being spied on, and I generally manage to get through my day without worrying that I&#x27;ll die at the hands of the US government.  I think that&#x27;s probably the biggest reason that so few people outside of HN/Reddit/etc. care about Snowden leaks.  I can find plenty of people that are upset about police brutality, and there&#x27;s lots of discussion about implementing body cameras, discrimination in law enforcement, etc. because I can find new, documented evidence of someone getting shot by a cop every other week.  It&#x27;s still not at the level where I worry that I&#x27;m going to get shot by a cop.  Snowden showed potential for abuse, not actual abuse.

These were low status positions, quite different from the &quot;fun side gig&quot; you says it was meant for.<p>You point to Northwestern&#x27;s law school as if it were the appropriate model for how adjunct teaching should be, and comment that many if not most made millions per year. However, the article says &quot;31 percent of part-time faculty are living near or below the federal poverty line&quot;.

Why you think your experience at a graduate program Northwestern can be generalized to undergraduate teaching and is applicable to most other schools in the US?<p>You write &#x27;But these adjuncts are also taking advantage of themselves willingly.&#x27; The article also addresses that point rather extensively, starting with &quot;But apart from feeling sorry for the underpaid faculty, why should we care that college professors have the same job conditions as day laborers, fast-food workers, cashiers, taxi drivers, or home-care aides? They did, after all, choose to pursue a career in higher ed.&quot; and ending some eight paragraphs later.<p>Moreover, they are not all &quot;willingly&quot; doing so.

When I&#x27;m calm and rational, I make better decisions than when I&#x27;m gripped by fear.<p>As an avid hiker and explorer, occasionally my fear of heights interferes with my enjoyment of my hobby. I try to push past it as much as possible, but when my heart is racing and my legs are shaking, a situation which would otherwise be safe can <i>become</i> dangerous.<p>Also, unlike you, I do have two friends who suffer from PTSD (it&#x27;s common enough that one may be surprised to find that a friend one has known for years wrestles with PTSD in some aspect of life but doesn&#x27;t advertise that fact). One of those friends has gotten off an elevator early because being in an enclosed situation with a stranger gave her a panic attack. Another called me on the phone nearly in tears because she had to stay late at work and walking across the deserted, dark carpark to her car was almost more than she could handle.<p>I think it would be great if a drug could help people like these two friends of mine go through life without feeling controlled by anxiety in situations like these. I also think it would be great if people like me whose day-to-day lives are unmarred by fear can do more things -- safely; the drug does not impair reason -- through this therapy. The tradeoffs are important to know (and as you say, the article does a great job exploring them), but to me this sounds really promising.",1453669853

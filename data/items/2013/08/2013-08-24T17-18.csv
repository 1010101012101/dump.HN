6269293,comment,6266863,6268790,2,0,codeonfire,,,"In my opinion, this idea about no one can work more than 8 hours a day productively was created to discredit anyone who tries to get ahead through extra effort.  It&#x27;s similar to the idea that says we only need 30 minutes of exercise a day.  In reality, pro athletes train for 4-6 hours a day.<p>Yes, a person is a fool if they do more than 8 hours in a workplace environment, but many people work longer days if it furthers their own personal goals.

Both are very interesting and were something I had on mind to do someday; that is why I asked to read about them.<p>Regarding the methodology/steps to help the guy: I do understand your point now and agree with all what you said, except the last bit - I still believe it&#x27;s better for him to have even that chance than nothing. Even though this experiment might not make him a programmer, he will have a &quot;motivator&quot; in front of him for some time, internet connection and a laptop. This could (and I hope it will) change something in him when the project is over, no matter the end result with JS.<p>I see outcomes from this project as far from linear; for example: he might use internet to learn about something else he tends to understand easily, discuss that with his &quot;mentor&quot; and possibly end up working in that sphere.  
He has more chances to do something with that guy, chromebook and JS books than with nothing.<p>Hope this makes sense.",1377366934
6269281,comment,6266863,6266863,4,0,DenisM,,,"For the sake of balance let me provide some &quot;defense&quot; of the system. I don&#x27;t actually like it, but there needs to be some perspective in the discussion.<p>A senior manager once confided to me that he does not have a shortage of good engineers to tackle even the most complex engineering problems, but he has acute shortage of people who are able to coordinate work of those good engineers. I have then concluded the review system makes sense in the light of this revelation. Hiring and Performance Review policies, however bad they seem, successfully maintain a pool of talented engineers; it&#x27;s a solved problem. The problem that is not solved is making sure those engineers make coordinated effort towards a worthy goal. It is Microsoft&#x27;s core belief that such coordination does not emerge naturally and so it must come from a leader or a group of &quot;leaders&quot;, and the goal of the review system is to identify and promote such leaders, even if they have to sacrifice some of the good engineers in the process (finding more is a solved problem). The way the find more &quot;leaders&quot; is measure people on &quot;scope of influence&quot;, with idea being that top engineer and manager talents will be able to influence more people compared to their peers. A sad byproduct of this approach is that a lot of people expand their visibility just for the sake of expanding their visibility. This produces a lot of sideffects, to the point where they sometimes become major output of the system rather than mere byproducts.<p>So if you wanted to know why the system works the way it does, above is a possible explanation that makes some sense.",1377366902

6269279,comment,6266863,6268485,3,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>&quot;Out of 15 mains, 2-3 are probably stars that people come specifically to eat. 10 are OK. 2-3 suck, they make people not come back.&quot;</i><p>Then fire them. It&#x27;s also important to note that the 2-3 who suck suck in relation to a consistent standard, not in relation to the other employees.<p>There is a fundamental disconnect between the justification of stack ranking and the actuality of stack ranking. In a sufficiently large population of employees you get some duds - that&#x27;s a statistical certainty. The giant leap and non sequitor is that <i>relatively ranking</i> will expose said duds better than measuring against a consistent, non-relative bar.<p>Where I work right now we&#x27;ve had the displeasure of having hired some duds. Very few mind you, but in all cases they were let go soon after it became apparent they were duds and could not be reasonably improved. All of this was done without the need for stack ranking, and (thankfully) outside the scope of some annual remove. If you&#x27;ve hired someone who&#x27;s actively detracting from your company, why in the frell are you waiting a whole year to remove them?!",1377366870

Here&#x27;s an example of that[0]:<p>&quot;Surprisingly, with pyrrole the predicted activation barriers were way out, with calculations less than a third of the measured value. After much head scratching, puzzled scientists turned to a purely quantum phenomenon called zero-point energy.<p>In classical physics, an object losing energy can continue to do so until it can be thought of as sitting perfectly still. In the quantum world, this is never the case: everything always retains some form of residual  even undetectable  energy, known as zero-point energy.<p>While zero-point energy is well known to be associated with motion of the atoms contained in molecules, it was previously believed that such tiny amounts of energy simply dont affect the molecule as a whole to any measurable extent, unless the molecule broke apart.<p>But now, the researchers have discovered that the quantum nature of the molecule&#x27;s internal motion actually does affect the molecule as a whole as it moves across the surface, defying the classical laws that its simply too big to feel quantum effects.&quot;<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/movement-of-pyrrole-molecules-defy-classical-physics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/movement-of-pyrrole-molec...</a>",1377365871

My solution, as yours and the author&#x27;s, is also to go back where my home and my friends are (this is still a month from now though).
I pretty much had the same problems too: meeting new people, having new colleagues and also do stuff with them, but never feeling quite connected.<p>So I&#x27;ve been wondering lately what this has to say about my personality. Am I just not ready yet to just leave what I call home now (and my friends and family) and start somewhere else again (maybe for a really worthwhile job in a cool city)? Or am I just the kind of person that is not cut out for doing this kind of stuff?
This uncertainty is also amplified by the fact that I have a friend who is about the same age as me, mid-twenties, who just last year left to live in L.A. and seems quite happy there.<p>Maybe you&#x27;d like to elaborate on how your life changed after you decided to go back and if you think you will ever try to live somewhere else (wherever that may be) again?

Two-thirds of it goes to other cities and towns on the Peninsula, the South Bay, and in Alameda County. In particular, many cities that the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct runs through get some of the water, because voter approval in those cities was part of the campaign to get the project built.<p>For example, 74% of Mountain View&#x27;s water comes from Hetch Hetchy. (They get 87% of their water from the SF Public Utilities Commission, and 85% of that comes from Hetch Hetchy.) [1]<p>Daly City, San Bruno, and South San Francisco currently get 67% of their water from SFPUC and the rest from local aquifers, with a project in the works to increase the SFPUC portion to 100%. [2]<p>Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and other towns also rely on it, although I don&#x27;t know the percentages.<p>Many have seen the pipeline that crosses the Bay between the Dumbarton Bridge and the old railroad bridge.<p>There are also a number places in the Peninsula and South Bay where you can see parts of the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, either the pipes themselves or the above-ground access hatches where the pipe is underground. These are white structures, often circular.<p>For example if you walk or run the Dish Trail at Stanford, you can see a number of these next to the northernmost part of the trail. This is part of the southern branch of the Aqueduct, which doesn&#x27;t cross the Bay but cuts south through Milpitas, Sunnyvale, and Mountain View.<p>Several places where you see a residential street that is divided with a very wide grassy or dirt median, that&#x27;s the Aqueduct: Sharon Heights Drive and Ivy Drive in Menlo Park are examples.<p>Along Edgewood Road near 280 there are a number of pipeline sections where it alternates between above-ground bridges and underground sections through those hills. The pipeline then parallels the Cordilleras Trail in the Pulgas Ridge Open Space Preserve where you can see some of the access structures.<p>On the other side of 280 on Caada Road there is the famous Pulgas Water Temple [4], where you can really get a sense of how much water flows through the Aqueduct.<p>For the obsessively curious like me, several years ago I traced the path of the southern branch of the Aqueduct and made a KML file marking some of the visible structures.

I see that your answer to the question that I <i>actually</i> asked is &quot;I don&#x27;t know what Rules of War they violated, if any, but I really like saying that Rules Were Violated, as it lends an air of authority and gravitas to my opinions.&quot;.<p>I feel that war is heinous, and a tool of last resort (right after &quot;We&#x27;ve tried every other reasonable option, let&#x27;s just do nothing and see how that turns out.&quot; is seriously considered and maybe tried for a while).<p>You seem to be unable to rationally think about situations that involve the killing of other humans. In order to analyze such situations, you have to temporarily suppress your visceral disgust for the situation and think about the <i>facts</i> of the <i>particular</i> situation.<p>In this particular situation you had one or two guys carrying what appeared to be RPGs, travelling with other men armed with RPGs and rifles near the area where US troops recently reported coming under RPG fire. Those folks were killed by people employed to kill (when deemed necessary), in order to prevent the injury or death of US troops. The van that arrived was removing enemy wounded or dead. If the occupants of that van had been successful, the folks who seemed to be involved in rocket attacks on US soldiers would be taken away and nursed back to health in an environment that would allow them to get back to firing RPGs at US soldiers. So, the van, and its occupants was destroyed.<p>It&#x27;s a pity that there were children in the van. I can understand that calculus that lead to the caretakers of those children endangering them in the way that they did. I cannot say that those caretakers made the wrong call.<p>The Reuters reporters were operating in an active war zone, and travelling with armed members of enemy forces. It&#x27;s a pity that they died, but that is a risk that they probably would have readily acknowledged that they were taking.<p>Reuters was likely denied access to the gunsight video in part because it corroborates the Pentagon&#x27;s assessment of the situation, and in part because the Army isn&#x27;t in the habit of handing out gunsight footage to interested non-military parties.<p>So, seriously. Suppress your visceral disgust for the situation, take forty minutes out of your life and watch the full-length gunsight video. It paints the situation in a different light. Whenever you feel yourself saying &quot;What! How could they do that? That&#x27;s clearly unreasonable!&quot;, pause the video, think carefully and critically about the situation revealed thus far, and maybe go back and review the last twenty or so seconds to ensure that what you thought you saw couldn&#x27;t reasonably be seen in another way.<p>Also, stop misquoting people. I don&#x27;t know why you think that that&#x27;s a reasonable thing to do, but it reflects <i>very</i> poorly on everything that you have to say.",1377363832

You have a $100 ticket and a $100 bill, and on the way to the theater you lose the ticket.  Would you spend your $100 to buy another one?  Most people wouldn&#x27;t, because they would be assigning a $200 cost to the theater department.<p>Now imagine that you only have a $100 bill with which you are going to pay the ticket, and you lose it on the way to the theater.  Would you take out your credit card and pay for the ticket anyway?  Most people would.<p>We know that if people were rational the two scenarios would be identical.  But they differ, and this is interesting because we have a framework from which to look into it, and we can see it doesn&#x27;t fit the framework, and therefore we can infer new and unexpected facts about the economic agents.  Models inform in interesting ways how we go about trying to understand reality, even when they are poor predictors.",1377363635

They will not go through any lengths to protect your assets (that aren&#x27;t automated), you might as well release it on the open web, because you&#x27;ll get the same amount of support (none) and you&#x27;ll have a bigger audience.  In fact, you&#x27;ll probably be safer if you can manage to fit most of the code on the back-end and present it as a web app.  By releasing it to Apple, you&#x27;re guaranteeing that it will be pirated in entirety.<p>I&#x27;m not being hyperbolic at all, you just don&#x27;t generally hear about this on news agg sites.  If your cloned App has been supported by spammy ad networks, chances are it&#x27;s making more money than yours, and Apple has every motivation they need to protect their App before yours and to drag their feet as much as possible.",1377363620

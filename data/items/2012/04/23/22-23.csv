3881436,comment,3880935,3881188,3,0,beagle3,,,"> Guess they are here forever and ever and ever<p>Google can easily de-throne facebook from the analytics crown:<p>1) establish a semi-dominant browser with automatic updates: done (chrome; strong on desktops, very strong on mobile)<p>2) establish ""privacy mode"" - disable likes in page, add them as a browser feature. Opt-in of course, but warn users about the privacy implications for letting a ""like"" button on the page go unquarantined.<p>3) wait a little and enjoy as Firefox (and Opera and Safari) do the same.<p>Within a year, facebook analytics stronghold is gone. Google has all that data from google analytics, which is about as prevalent as ""likes"", but does not look as devious (even though it is).<p>Facebook's SSO might be here to stay, but I'm sure Google are already working to undermine that as well. And that makes me happy. Not because I think google is less evil than facebook (it is less evil for now, but that could and will change after a couple of bad quarters) -- but because facebook's ""like"" buttons are a plague upon the web, the functionality of which SHOULD be included in browsers (assuming people and web masters want that, and it appears they do).<p>(Writing this as a happy RequestPolicy user who is not telling Facebook or Google Analytics anything he does not want them to know, except an IP address; I don't want them to know that, but I do have to tell them).",1335221933

Japanese speakers also fail to make the /l/ and /r/ distinction and its a rather stereotypical feature of a Korean or Japanese accent in English. Japanese happens to have sounds for both /f/ and /p/ unlike Korean, but not for /f/ and /h/.

SkyDrive can be a way of providing file-syncing and sharing that's 'good-enough' for their employees/company. (edit: by which I mean it's a valid strategy to try and protect your turf).<p>I can see an analogy here with Sharepoint. My (limited) experiences with Sharepoint have been annoying and tedious yet the fact that it integrates with existing MS products and is 'good-enough' has made it very successful for Microsoft [1].  I'm not trying to suggest that SkyDrive could be a $1b business but that we shouldn't write it off so quickly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/microsofts-billion-dollar-businesses-2011-10?op=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/microsofts-billion-dollar-bus...</a>",1335221893

This doesn't sound like the <i>level of effort</i> is 1000 (or 100, or possibly even 10) times less for what they've accomplished than it would have been had they implemented exactly the same functionality in, say, Java.  Would the Java code have been 1000 times bigger?  It seems quite likely that it would have!  But the bulkiness of the end product's source code doesn't determine the amount of effort that went into building it.<p>Could it be that they spent four and a half years figuring this new system out, and a few weeks writing the 20K lines of source?  It could; I haven't read most of their papers.  If that was the case, then that's what needs to be pointed out to refute the assumption that they're spending as much or almost as much effort on the end product (but with astonishingly little source code required to specify it).",1335221817

I never connect a mouse to my PC, and I do Visio and something called Netformx DesignXpert, which require very precise positioning.  If you get a MBP or the TrackPad accessory for any other Mac, and you force yourself to learn it for a few days (like a Blackberry user going to iPhone), I believe you too will be sold.  Even if I spend 80% of my day in a VM Windows 7 instance, the built-in MBP track pad is better than any mouse or trackpad I have ever used.<p>Secondly, I believe people are full of it when they say you spend a premium on a MBP.  HP had a PC laptop similar in construction of a MBP (solid metal casing, not sure if aluminum), and it cost more than the MBP.  If you compare Apples to Apples HW-wise from the enclosure, to the screen, to the keyboard touch, to the trackpad rather than just the GHz rating on the CPU, I believe you will find that the MBP price is very competitive for what you are getting.<p>If you just want the fastest thing you can get and you do not care if it is made from cheap plastic and is fragile as all get out, and has poor screen resolution, you probably do not want to bother with Apple.",1335221669

And day by day the search algorithms are changing, and search rankings lately are all over the place with algorithm updates. Many SEO leaders will support the argument that spammers dominate and the algorithms are struggling to get it right. Something I agree with.

3881388,comment,3880837,3880837,78,0,codyrobbins,,,"Having an alphabet, as it does, Korean indeed isnt hard to learn to read and write. The difficulty is learning how to pronounce it properlyit has a number of distinct consonants that are treated as the same consonant in most other languages and that therefore are extremely difficult for non-native speakers to distinguish and produce properly.<p>For example, it has three distinct unvoiced velar stops [1] which are all considered the same sound in English: normal [k], aspirated [k], and faucalized [k].<p>We use both the normal and aspirated [2] unvoiced velar stops in English as positional allophones [3], meaning we consider them the same sound but theyre actually different and we distinguish between them unconsciously depending on where the sound occurs in a word. For example, /k/ is aspirated in word-initial position in words like <i>cam</i> but unaspirated after word-initial /s/ in words like <i>scam</i>. If you listen closely enough you realize that you turbulently expire a lot of air after the <i>c</i> in <i>cam</i> but dont do so in <i>scam</i>. Despite using both phones [4] in English, you consider them more or less the same hard <i>k</i> soundif you pronounce <i>cam</i> with an unaspirated /k/ it may sound slightly odd but youll still consider it the same word <i>cam</i>. The problem is that in Korean doing so would result in two different wordsso it makes it hard for English speakers to perceive distinct words in Korean that differ this way, and to pronounce the correct word that they intend when talking.<p>This is true for many languages because phoneme inventories never overlap, but its especially difficult for English learners of Korean because Korean has a third /k/ soundthe faucalized [5] oneand it doesnt occur at all in English. I know phonologistspeople who are trained in the study of human speech categorieswho have an extremely difficult time discerning between [k] and [k].<p>Peter Ladefoged, one of the worlds foremost phoneticians, has a fantastic website to accompany his phonetics textbook and it has recordings of all the sounds known to be produced in human languages. You can listen to the distinctions between the Korean consonants here:<p><a href=""http://phonetics.ucla.edu/appendix/languages/korean/korean.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phonetics.ucla.edu/appendix/languages/korean/korean.h...</a><p>The /k/ sounds Ive been discussing are the third row down (<i>weight of measure</i>, <i>rope</i>, and <i>large</i>). As an English speaker try to hear a difference between how the consonant is pronouncedits extremely difficult to notice.<p>Our sensitivity to these phonemic distinctions develops at an extremely early age: by one month old infants already begin to stop distinguishing between different sounds that their language slots into the same category as the same sound [6]. Infants dont even babble at this age never mind produce or understand adult speech, but they have already stopped noticing certain differences in speechthats how deeply ingrained the way we perceive and produce speech is, and why its almost impossible to speak a non-native language without an accent.<p>(I am only tangentially familiar with Korean phonology so I might be getting some of the details slightly wrong hereplease correct me if Ive misstated anything.)<p>###<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unvoiced_velar_stop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unvoiced_velar_stop</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_(phonetics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_(phonetics)</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faucalized_voice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faucalized_voice</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/171/3968/303"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/171/3968/303</a> & <a href=""http://home.fau.edu/lewkowic/web/Eimas%20infant%20speech%20discrim%20Science%201971.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.fau.edu/lewkowic/web/Eimas%20infant%20speech%20d...</a>",1335221370

I'm a fairly normal guy, I've been out of high school for 3 years now and I'm making slightly less than Bureau of Labor Statistic's 2010 Median Income for 'Software Developers', which I believe is more than enough to not be considered underemployed.<p>I see a lot of psychic pain in my peers about how hard work is or the labor market is so difficult, but to be frank the failures I see are directly attributable to plain laziness in a generation addicted to easy and inane pleasure.<p>I'm afraid young people of today are losing the real virtues of life like living with passion and taking responsibility for who you are. The ability to make something out of yourself and feeling joy in life is more alive today than in any other point in human history.<p>I see a lot of active rejection of the ideals of hacker culture, perhaps epitomized by my generation's obsession with video games and fake work. This is really a shame, as one thing that comes out of hacker culture is not a feeling of defeatism, but rather a feeling of a real kind of exuberance about your work and life. Your work is yours to create. I've read the college labor statistics with some interest, even fear. But when I read them, I can't help but think that something essential about our generation and present technological zeitgeist is being left out. As if somehow our work is simply just a confluence of forces far beyond our control, framing college graduates as fragmented or marginalized which opens up a world of excuses.<p>From Chaitin to Stallman, when hackers talk about the meaning of work, they're not talking about abstract decisions, they're talking about you reading this post, doing something that has concrete consequences, making decisions and accepting the consequences. It may be true that there are seven billion people on the planet, never the less, your work matters in material terms, as well as to others.<p>In short, I'd encourage any young person my age to not write themselves off as a victim of societal forces.

So swapping out their memory that hasn't been used for N hours isn't a bad thing.<p>And yes, the logic is sound, its better to use a bit of swap for an infrequent daemon and let 4-5 megs of memory be at the ready if needed than leave it in place all the time. The ""speedup"" is not a speedup for your use, its to allow for better memory management. Which is what the VM subsystem is there for. Second guessing it all the time just makes its job harder.<p>Swap use when there is free memory isn't a bad thing.

3881192,comment,3878661,3880121,6,0,T-hawk,,,"The difference is in creep of functionality and expectations.  So much stuff that wasn't even on the table 10 or 20 years ago is now expected so inherently that it's not even set out in the requirements.  All those extra classes, complexity, and layers of abstraction do have purposes.  We can continue talking about the Microsoft stack; my experience is there too.  Yes, in older days you could knock together a report with ten lines of database code and a form in Visual Basic or even Access.<p>But expectations change.  Your fat client VB Win32 app isn't good enough in a world where everyone expects to have every piece of functionality accessible with no client installation, using a web browser.  Now you're rewriting it in ASP.  Now you have to deal with sessions (which VB gave you for free just by virtue of the fact that the program ran continuously in memory), concurrency, logging, IIS hosting, and loads of other complexity.  The functionality gains are huge over your VB program: easy access for multiple distributed users.  It's just not so visible since it's just an expectation of the platform.<p>Five years later, now your standalone ASP pages are losing out to slicker competitors.  Now every good site has on every page a banner and breadcrumb trail and sidebar menu and search box.  That's not something that ASP does, unless you fake it with piles of server-side includes inserted into every page.  So you move to ASP.NET with its concepts of master pages and HTTP pipeline modules and hierarchical controls.  These give loads of functionality over and above older ways of doing things, even if you use only a small part of it.  Multipliers of effort now exist in places and degrees that weren't previously possible.<p>Now your business wants federated single-sign-on with a partner web site and company.  This wasn't even conceivable for a desktop Win32 app twenty years ago.  But now you can implement it by invoking a few WIF library calls from the correct layers of abstraction.  Sure, it'll take longer and more complexity than your single login box in your VB desktop application.  But it's flexible and scalable in ways previously unimagined.<p>Or think about the back end.  Twenty years ago, that was an Access or Sybase database where 5000 rows was a lot.  Now modern database platforms scale past five billion rows, on any number of servers across a farm, with all sorts of automated procedures for live backups and encryption and failover and sharding and whatever else.<p>Maybe you're thinking of SQL Server Reporting Services?  Yeah, it seems like it takes a long time to implement that compared to a one-off report with some charting control.  But you get whopping loads of functionality along for the ride: pagination, filtering, printer formatting, linkage to CRUD actions, ability to clone the report for editing.  You don't think about the functionality because it just comes as expected with the platform.  And yes, some of the complexity will leak out into your application code (""no, don't page-break between the transactions for stock sale and cash credit."")  But paying the price on an apparently slower or overengineered implementation really can give you highly leveraged multipliers of effort.<p>Recalibrate your notion of ""same functionality"" and you'll see why the software industry has gone where it has.",1335218576

3881187,comment,3875941,3876906,2,0,mchannon,,,"No problem.  My experience has been mostly with SNL, LANL, and ORNL.  These labs are richly stocked with extremely bright people working on solving some very important problems.<p>Some of these problems have commercial applications, some are strictly of value to the government, and some are so far out there that no one's really sure where they'll end up (how again was ARPAnet supposed to be used for defense?).<p>Two different points:<p>The problem with commercializing government technology is that you need an entrepreneur to push it.  The labs do make overtures to allow their well-paid and securely-employed scientists to leave the nest, but the scientists seldom want to stop being scientists, give up a comfortable and tenured six-figure income, to network and sell when if they wanted to network and sell they wouldn't have gone for the Ph.D. in the first place.<p>If I'm in a metro area where I can, without moving, find a job making a comfortable living doing what I like after my startup fails,  I'm much more likely to take that plunge.  In ""company towns"" like Los Alamos or Oak Ridge, there really isn't any chance of that.<p>This leaves a relay baton drop between scientists who don't sell and would-be entrepreneurs with nothing worth selling.<p>No problem, the labs can license their stuff out.  Problem, the terms of these licenses usually carve out a pretty generous chunk for the lab that spawned the technology, and the implicit terms include delays and risk of expropriation.<p>The terms of the lab carveout are often pre-ordained, based on revenues instead of margins, and don't take into account whether or not a business model can support them (because it has to be fair and defensible, and how do you know ahead of time what's fair?).<p>This leaves a would-be licensor to choose between many worthy projects, and as you want to be close both to your inventor and possible funding sources, this creates a bias toward licensing big-city lab technologies like those found at ANL, LLNL, LBL, NREL, and SNL-Livermore.",1335218489

Or the browser could use a tool tip, and ghost the headers on scroll or something.<p>If I want a fixed header on a table.  Couldn&#x27;t I just fix the body height on the tbody, and use an overflow: scroll, to achieve the same effect?  or am I missing something?<p>Forgive me as I&#x27;m still unsure as to what position:sticky actually means.

6373300,comment,6372461,6373182,3,0,klibertp,,,"One last reply from me for the time being:<p>> * I am moving the cursor, but I want to enter text. To do so, I need to enter colon, i, Enter, then my first text entry.<p>That&#x27;s incorrect. You can just press &#x27;i&#x27; to enter insert mode in place. Or upper case &#x27;I&#x27; to have Vim enter insert mode at the end of a line. Or upper case O for insert mode at the beginning of freshly inserted line below the current. Or &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27; and many other&#x27;s for other kinds of movement/change+enter insert mode combos.<p>> * I am entering text, but I want to move the cursor. To do so, I need to type Esc, Esc, then commence moving the cursor.<p>No, the arrows work (should work, may be a problem on some terminals/terminal emulators, but that&#x27;s common for console editors) in insert mode. No need for <esc> (and it&#x27;s single <esc>, not double, anyway) if you want to move by a few characters. Ctrl+<arrow> works in insert mode, too, so you can move by words. You lose prefixes and other kinds of movements though.<p>> * If while entering text, I want to do something besides move the cursor, I need to type Esc, colon, then a command letter, then its arguments.<p>That&#x27;s only true if the command is not bound to a sequence of keystrokes. If it is, it&#x27;s frequently as efficient to type as in modeless editors, for example going to a certain line in Vim is done with <esc><number>G, while in Emacs it&#x27;s default binding is M-g g <number> <enter>. If the command is not bound, both <esc> : <command> <args> <enter> and M-x <command> <enter> <args> <enter> beat navigating through menus with mouse in terms of efficiency and that&#x27;s what they are for, not for the commonly used commands which should be (nv)maped or global-bind-key&#x27;ed anyway.<p>> I don&#x27;t need to &quot;make it sound more complicated than it is.&quot;<p>Well, you do, as shown above.<p>>  I wold pass the mouse cursor across the desired characters, thus selecting them (any subset of characters or words or paragraphs, and very, very fast)<p>Well... I would like to measure this somehow.<p>You assert that using a mouse for this is quicker, but present no evidence. I have no evidence for the contrary, so we can&#x27;t really argue about this. I personally <i>feel</i> that reaching for the mouse and using it is slower than selecting text with keyboard and that the latter requires less manual precision, which matters to me. You can <i>feel</i> differently and I respect and accept it.<p>We - Vim users here - can probably show you shorter and more efficient counterpart to any example you&#x27;d come up with. That you don&#x27;t know these more efficient ways is a valid criticism of Vim in itself - which is not a popular claim among Vim users, but I think so - but it&#x27;s argument for Vim not being friendly to beginners, not for it being inefficient.",1378983504

Looking at the HackFWD companies, that doesn&#x27;t seem to apply with the broadness that the statement suggests. Could it be that someone who actually went through the steps (Paul Graham, developer - built, founded and exited Viaweb) is in a better position to pass on knowledge on that than someone who didn&#x27;t (Lars Hinrichs, business guy - hired developers, founded and excited Xing)?<p>While I find the passion, generosity and appetite for risk behind HackFWD more than commendable: it looks like it would have taken a larger vision (possibly even larger & more costly than YC) to carry a tech-focused EU incubator forward. I understand that the decision to cut losses is probably the right one, but if he&#x27;s unwilling to stick it out for 5-7+ years - YC was started in March 2005! -, maybe he shouldn&#x27;t have started HackFWD in the first place. The way it stands now, the one who benefited most seems to have been Lars through publicity and reputation (cf. European Commission etc.)",1378983200

Actually any editor with commands bound to key sequences can be said to be modal in the light of what he writes.

I was in a car wreck several years ago, and it has been a nightmare ever since.<p>The main symptom for me is the continual feeling of pressure in the back of the head, and a bit of tenderness over the greater occipital nerves.  I can still program somewhat effectively, but my short term memory is horrible, and quick-thinking is down the tubes.  It&#x27;s fairly similar to a mild/moderate hangover.<p>I would not say that I am dumb or truly have the same experience as someone of low IQ, but the whole experience has instilled a bit of resentment towards the Silicon Valley mindset that every dev must be a quick-thinking, 10x wiz kid.  I am not an A-player at this point, but by putting in a few extra hours a week I can keep up with the devs on my team, and I try to make sure my output is somewhat on par.<p>Fortunately, botox has made a tremendous impact (takes pressure off the nerves), and I&#x27;m getting surgery soon so fingers crossed I can make a solid recovery.",1378980047

200262,comment,200173,200184,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"I think you are confused.  It isn't a check box requirement with regards to incorporating in NV.  You can incorporate there, do business wherever, and never set foot there.  In that case, you would be paying taxes in all the places you do business.<p>In other words, you don't have to just do business in NV to evade taxes elsewhere, you have to do <i>all</i> your business in NV.  For example, say you incorporate in NV and do all your business in CA--that's fine.  You would just pay all your taxes in CA.  And if you had offices in three states, you would be registering in all three of those states and paying taxes accordingly.<p>""Doing business"" is a matter of state law and so its definition varies from state to state.  However, generally, if you have an office in a state, you will have to register there and are subject to taxation there.  What that means exactly depends on your particular situation and what exactly you are doing in those jurisdictions.  For example, if you just pay employees there you probably need to pay various employer taxes, whereas if you have a physical store there you will need to pay sales and income taxes, most likely.  And if your only office is in CA, you will most likely pay all your taxes there.",1211817034

(Beginning song writers often pitch songs with recordings that are overly produced.  This makes it hard for the artist to see how she'd do the song.)<p>Unless, of course, you're just looking for contract programmers.  They'll do exactly what you want, but they want cash.<p>It's important to realize that if most of the payoff that you're offering is equity, folks expect to contribute as well.

I suppose it has evolutionary benefits in the management of complexity. You focus on the actions of yourself and your prey, everything else is the province of the sky God. If you spend too much time brooding over how Aunt Judy got eaten by a saber-tooth tiger then the wildebeest you're hunting might get away.<p>It's frustrating that these weird beliefs are so widespread in modern society, but it looks like the world is slowly moving away from it. It gives me higher self-esteem to be secular now when I am ridiculed for it than in the future when most people believe like me.",1211815747

When I applied 5 years ago I definitely wasn't the academic they were looking for.<p>Anyway my point is just that I wouldn't put too much stock in the fact that just because these institutions are filled with arguably the brightest people in the land that this will automatically propel you upwards. I personally feel that the value of a university is very closely tied to its curriculum, not its resources or people.<p>(anecdotal evidence: I know some people who went to universities with more stringent entry requirements and left there only knowing how to program in Pascal. In my university they now teach Haskell, Prolog and Java in year 1).<p>If you still feel very strongly about the benefits of networking in Oxbridge you can always apply to do an MBA.",1211815022

That would be a gross simplification.<p>However, it's also a gross simplification to say it's just about which countries like other countries.<p>For example: I'm writing this from Norway, which finished (they tell me) the best of all Western European countries.  Now, Terry Wogan would argue that this is because of ""Scandinavian Bloc"" voting, but the fact of the matter is that you could remove the points given to Norway by Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland, and give them to England, and Norway would still be far ahead of England in terms of points.<p>In fact, England is a great example of how Wogan's theory breaks down-- of 43 countries voting, only 2 chose England's song to be in the top 10 of 25 options.  <i>Every single country involved</i> liked some one or more Eastern European song better than England's, <i>independent of geographical location or political alliance.</i><p>So, let's not pretend it's <i>all</i> political-- some of it actually appears to relate to the music.",1211814957

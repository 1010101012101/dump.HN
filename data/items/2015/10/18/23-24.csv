So you have an instance type for memcached, one for postgres, one for Node, one for nginx, one for Redis, one for your JVM, etc.  In many cases, these apps <i>already</i> include user-level scheduling and resource management, which often works at cross purposes with the OS.  In other cases, they could run much faster if they implemented these specialized to their particular workload, and didn&#x27;t need to run through an OS scheduler that also needs to support responsive desktop apps.",1445212696

10410372,comment,10409444,10410277,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Another important point is how many airlines have standardized their narrow-body fleets. Maintaining a single type/family is simpler and often cheaper than having trained crew, mechanics and parts available for multiple types of aircraft.<p>In the US, for example, Southwest and (mainline) Alaska are both pure-737 fleets. Virgin America, Frontier and Spirit are all A320-family, with JetBlue operating only A320 family and the E190. US Airways, prior to its merger with American, was moving toward an all-A320-family narrow-body fleet and was nearly there (only a few 757s were left, and US Airways was looking to replace them with a long-range variant of the A321 once it became available).<p>So a new narrow-body type -- whether it&#x27;s COMAC&#x27;s C919 or Bombardier&#x27;s C-Series -- probably will never make it into those carriers&#x27; fleets, which in turn makes it that much harder to break into the market.<p>Added to that, the existing manufacturers (Airbus and Boeing) are established enough and have the resources to be able to offer significant discounts to an airline which commits to a large fleet overhaul. New entrants likely are not financially able to do that, putting them at more of a disadvantage in trying to place their first aircraft with the airlines.",1445212684

Saying that even something like a Dyson sphere surrounding the sun would only provide finite energy is not a valid reason for population controls here and now.<p>> <i>prefers city life</i><p>Not really, but preferences aside, most living apart from civilization still benefit from a larger civilization to support their needs.

10410247,comment,10409040,10409040,0,0,jpgoldberg,,,"Hello all, I&#x27;m the Chief Defender Against the Dark Arts at AgileBits, the makers of 1Password.<p>The discussion and analysis in Dale Myers&#x27; article is very good, although someone who just reads the headline could very easily come away with the wrong impression.<p>The &quot;older&quot; .agilekeychain format (AKF) â€” designed nearly a decade ago â€“ does indeed expose the same sorts of information that would be in someone&#x27;s browser bookmarks. So if someone gets hold of your AKF data they will be able to see what sites you have Logins for and what titles you have for your items.<p>Given the constraints we faced back then, that might have been a reasonable design choice at the time. But it is certainly not an acceptable design choice today.<p>The article does point out that that the OPVault data format was introduced as a replacement for the AKF back in December 2012. The OPVault format not only encrypts much more of the metadata, but it also provides for authenticated encryption and includes many other improvements.<p>The article also points out that the behavior of the AKF &quot;discovered&quot; is documented in many places. We&#x27;ve blogged about it, we&#x27;ve talked about it on our discussion forums and it is in the docs. What isn&#x27;t in place is some big red letters in the user interface that says &quot;Using this format leaves URLs and Titles unencrypted&quot;.<p>Dale Myers&#x27; article also correctly points out that we do offer instructions on how to migrate your data from the Agile Keychain format to OPVault.<p>The article criticizes us for \n(a) Not making OPVault the default for new Dropbox synching, and\n(b) Not providing a nice easy way to migrate<p>Obviously we would love to see everyone on the new data format. It is a big improvement over the old one in an enormous number of respects, but until we can be confident that everyone is running clients on all of their platforms that can handle the new format, we are treating migration as an &quot;expert only&quot; thing.<p>Rolling out a data format change when you have one &quot;product&quot; and one platform is easy. But we need to make make sure that people are using versions (and that such versions are available) of 1Password that handle the new format on all of the devices that they sync with.<p>So if we were to make OPVault the default sync format on Mac, we would need to know that the 1Password app people are using on Windows. We have been conservative about this.<p>Also, in our beta testing of data migration, we discovered a nasty bug in how we encoded keys for the some attachments. The result is that some of our beta testers would have lost data if they had not had good backups of their AKF data. Obviously, that is not something we wanted to push into general release. (Only attachments created in specific circumstances were victims of that, so we didn&#x27;t spot it in internal testing.)<p>Now you may very well disagree with some of our judgement calls, particularly about how cautious we have been and continue to be in migrating people to the new format. But I hope that even if you do disagree, you will see that there are reasons for our choices.",1445209632

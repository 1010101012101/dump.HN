I just wonder if it reaches anyone...It's a great interface, and has the best user experience of all of the news wire type companies I've seen, but it's also free...and since anyone can send out a press release any time they feel like it, for absolutely no cost, it pretty much guarantees nobody is paying attention.

Help me out?"" entry in a news feed does not clearly indicate that xxx asked a question that he wants his friends to answer.  ""xxx wants you to answer his question: 'blah blah blah...'"" is vastly better, imho",1183165980

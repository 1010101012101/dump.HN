It`s `malloc`for linked rather than sequential memory</i><p>Yeah, cons is like malloc, except that the object it creates is automatically memory managed / garbage collected. There is no corresponding &quot;free&quot; call. Actually, that means cons is not like malloc.<p><i>Clojure takes advantage of being fully managed code</i><p>Do you realize that Lisp uses automatic memory management (just like the JVM or CLR)?",1400698781

There are less than a half dozen libraries I&#x27;ll use without hesitation. The others get evaluated carefully on author, size, criticality, and my domain knowledge, with the default choice being: &quot;no, don&#x27;t want to deal&quot;.<p>But that&#x27;s a criticism of all package managers everywhere, and I think it&#x27;s clear that popular ones promote higher quality libraries, over time.<p>CocoaPods is young yet.

7780058,comment,7779300,7779555,2,0,loudmax,,,"One of the main purposes of the wealth tax is not to raise funds.  The tax described in the book would be quite low, below 1%.  Remember, the rate of return on fortunes over a million Euros (below this, they wouldn&#x27;t be subject to the tax) is around 5%.  So this does little to slow the global concentration of wealth.<p>The main purpose of the tax is to <i>track</i> this wealth.  When Piketty did research on the fortunes of the very wealthiest individuals, he had to rely on estimates from Forbes magazine, whose methodology is far from scientific.  The idea is that with a better public understanding of where and how wealth is concentrated, we can formulate better policy.",1400698726

I&#x27;ve searched long and hard, high and low, for free (beer) horse racing databases for UK/IRE and Australia. To a lesser extent I&#x27;ve searched for HK, FR and GER data. I&#x27;m yet to find anything that is comprehensive and no cost.<p>There&#x27;s a couple that I do use for UK/IRE racing which cost in the region of £35-£45 per month for access. Betwise/Smartform provides an historical database in MySQL, and daily race card/results updates. UKHorseRacing.co.uk provides CVS files with historical race data, their ratings and race results. I take these CVS files, combine them into a SQLite database and interrogate with R.<p>A slightly longer answer is, sort of. The Betfair API is currently open access for non-commercial and low volume use (as far as I&#x27;m aware). This will allow you to retrieve basic racing data - the cards before that race with horse name, jockey, barrier etc and the race results post-race including the Betfair Starting Price. After interrogating the API, you&#x27;ll need to obviously compile the data into your own database. A bit of work, but feasible. Betfair has a developer programme and their are API bindings available in a number of different languages. I use R (R package developed by Betwise mentioned above), but I know Python is available. One caveat to mention is that Betfair are upgrading their API, so this will obviously have an impact on existing programs using the old one.<p>If anyone else has additional information or could point me in the direction of something else &quot;free&quot; I&#x27;d appreciate it as well.",1400698082

We&#x27;re best friends in many way and we support each other in our own dreams.  Before my daughter was born, I was mostly doing consulting. I made sure I spent time walking and taking care of my wife. I made it a point to never miss a doctor appointment or any pregnancy/childbirth classes we have together. I really appreciated every step of the way.<p>Then my daughter was born, I stopped accepting new clients (as mentioned in the piece). Spent time with my wife and newborn.  Then I stayed home for another three months with my daughter so my wife could return to work.<p>When I joined the startup, after much discussion and encouragement from my wife, I also made a promise to never miss any doctor appointment. That is still true. I feel blessed that I was able to afford much flexibility with my family and I never take it for granted. I know many other folks who go through a much more difficult time.<p>I think there is much more I could do and of course I&#x27;ll continue to do my very best to be a good person every day. This was written as a personal thought and shared because I wanted to feel for myself and others, that we are not sitting alone on that home-bound train, if that makes any sense.<p>I hope that clarifies things a bit more.<p>-V.",1400697981

The system that was built 15 years ago might have limited the field for performance or storage reasons and it was never updated. Or maybe the Palm Pilot app only supports 20 characters in a text field and nobody has the source code but there&#x27;s still a dedicated bunch of 200 users who do $50,000 in sales every year and nobody wants to piss them off. Or maybe they&#x27;re just afraid the monster has gotten too big and they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;ll break if they change anything. Better to play it conservative so you&#x27;re not the person who shut a group of users out of the system.<p>2. Just because. True story: I was working on an internal app for a company years back and I asked my manager if there were any particular password restrictions we needed to honor, any kind of company policies or weird accessibility concerns or something [1]. So what does he do? He emails the marketing stakeholder and asks her what the password rules should be. She doesn&#x27;t know anything about security, so she concocts something completely arbitrary based on stuff she&#x27;s seen on other sites. 6-10 characters, at least one number & one symbol, etc. And those were the requirements I had to implement, because that&#x27;s what the stakeholder wants, even though that was the answer to completely the wrong question.<p>> if passwords are being hashed, which i guess i would have to believe they are<p>I wouldn&#x27;t assume that. Think about a bank where you have call center staff who know a certain customer by name because he calls every Thursday saying he can&#x27;t remember which of his grandkids&#x27; names he used as a password and could you please tell him because the rent is due Monday and he needs to transfer money from savings to checking because his Social Security check is late this month. And so on. You know how old guys are with their stories. You&#x27;re reading one now. The CSR doesn&#x27;t want to walk him through the steps of resetting his password over the phone…again. The faster he can get him logged in, the sooner he&#x27;ll go away.<p>&quot;We need a way to display that guy&#x27;s password to a CSR,&quot; the head of the department tells the CEO over golf, knowing if he gets the department&#x27;s average call time under two minutes he gets an extra $100,000 this year. So, the edict comes down from the highest levels of the company that the passwords have to be encrypted & reversible instead of hashed.<p>Now, this story is completely fictitious, but I&#x27;ve been in similar situations where the all-important call-center & support metrics trumped security.

The bad news is that it&#x27;s illiquid and we don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s a better investment than the stock market or one of the companies we see on the front page everyday.

As such, the roads between Comcast and Level3ton are constantly crowded with big trucks hauling all the ordered goods from Level3ton to Comcastica.<p>Comcastica is now saying to Level3ton that they&#x27;re sending far too many trucks for Comcastica&#x27;s roads, and wants Level3ton to pay for Comcastica to expand their roads.<p>Level3ton is, of course, only sending the trucks because the residents of Comcastica are demanding them. If Comcastica&#x27;s roads aren&#x27;t large enough, it&#x27;s because they underbuilt their road infrastructure given the number of residents they have.<p>The only reasonable course of action here is for Comcastica to take all the taxes they collect from their residents and use some of it to build better roads, in order to service all the vehicle traffic that Comcastica&#x27;s residents are creating. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the vehicles are coming from Level3ton, it only matters that the vehicles are servicing Comcastica&#x27;s residents needs.<p>[1] Presumably Comcast could route traffic through a common peer to both, but they&#x27;d have to pay for that privilege, so I&#x27;m going to consider that irrelevant at the moment.",1400697046

I think by the time Simon gave that particular presentation he&#x27;d been saying the same stuff on a regular basis for a good two years, so it started to sound really rehearsed. Have a look at some of his older videos eg. [1] Although, that is, to a major degree, just how Simon sounds when he talks.<p>I don&#x27;t think you fully understand the implications of what NBN Co is building.<p>> Te point of the NBN is getting fiber in the ground that no one company owns.<p>This is exactly what is <i>not</i> happening. Labor&#x27;s NBN Co is (was?) building another Telstra-like monopoly. The <i>one company</i> that owns the fibre is NBN Co. which will, like almost every other government asset, be sold at a loss to a private company. And, like Telstra, it will become notorious for dragging its feet when it comes to appropriately pricing the wholesale service.<p>> He also has a point about the number of POIs that NBN will require the wholesalers to interface with. But again, this is missing the forest for the trees.<p>While you (I don&#x27;t mean you personally, I mean &#x27;you&#x27; in the general sense of the Australian voter) are focus on &#x27;fibre regardless of costs&#x27; then yes, sure, you&#x27;re correct.<p>> Simon doesn&#x27;t make that argument.<p>You&#x27;re right, he doesn&#x27;t. That is <i>my</i> argument. And, like I always said from the very first first announcement of the NBN &quot;well that will take Labor winning the next 6 elections&quot;.<p>> The NBN is about getting non-monopolized fiber in the ground. Once that&#x27;s done everything else about it can be changed to suit his or your desires.<p>Change. Yes, just like Telstra. In fact, the scenario with Telstra is <i>better</i> than NBN Co. At least Telstra has been forced to resell ULL (Unbundled Local Loop, ie. vacant copper) to ISPs. NBN Co. is being built from the ground up to <i>not</i> be like that.<p>WHY!<p>I&#x27;ll take Dark fibre to the premises, or no fibre thanks.<p>The creation of NBN Co. even resulted in the enactment of new legislation that prohibits competing fibre network builds. Hell, NBN Co. is taking TPG to court over TPGs pre-existing fibre network! [2] This is decided <i>not</i> the role NBN Co. could be playing.<p>(edit: clarity)<p>1. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMeYr2_rJmo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMeYr2_rJmo</a>\n2. <a href=""http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/nbn-turns-the-heat-on-tpg/story-e6frg8zx-1226887050492#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/nbn-turns-the-heat-...</a>",1400696905

See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates</a> , sort by &quot;Individual (max)&quot;, and note that only France, Belgium, Sweden, and Aruba are higher.<p>b) Corporate tax is <i>extremely</i> high. Note that many will correctly state that some corporations are able to avoid some of the corporate tax. This is true, though overstated if you only follow what the NYT reports. For domestic US corporations doing business only in the US, their <i>effective</i> corporate rate will range between 35% and 45%, depending on their state.<p>e) Estate taxes. We pay 50% of our net worth upon death on all assets transferred to our descendants. A truly morally repugnant tax, this one. Passing on our advantages and earnings to our children is a great joy to many people.<p>d) Tax enforcement is insanely strict. Prison sentences and hefty fines await those who transgress.<p>e) We can&#x27;t leave: American citizens pay tax to the US government even if they reside elsewhere. If we give up our citizenship, we must pay the US government between 30 and 40% of our net worth. The US is the only OECD nation to do this.<p>2. <i>US taxes are lowest they&#x27;ve been since XX!&quot;<p>This is true for low and middle earners, whose current tax rates are very low. Not true for high earners. The US tax code is the most progressive in the OECD.<p>The last tax reform was under Reagan. He traded high tax rates with lots of loopholes for moderate tax rates with few loopholes. Since then, the few loopholes have largely been closed (with exceptions, such as the popular </i>middle class* home interest deduction) whilst rates have risen substantially.<p>See the wiki link above: top US income tax rates are the fifth highest in the world.<p>3. <i>Overall US taxation is low!</i><p>As detailed above, the US taxation regime is the most progressive in the OECD. But taxation is still not low. At 34% of GDP[1], it&#x27;s higher than Canada and only 5 points lower than the UK. 11 points less than France.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/total"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/total</a>",1400696496

Let&#x27;s also just assume the taxed wealth is somehow simply destroyed, to avoid the potential problem of favoritism in the way the government spends the tax revenue.

Once you get to the point where you have to make risky moves, you open up the luck angle a lot. The skill comes from knowing the probabilities and making plays with positive expected value over the long run, even if it means eliminating yourself from the tournament due to chance.

Here I will link to the study &quot;Not Just the Problems of Other People&#x27;s Children: U.S. Student Performance in Global Perspective&quot;[1] that underlies the news report submitted here. The full study report will of course give you details that a brief news report has no space to provide. It&#x27;s good to read a news report from British journalists about education issues here in the United States, as the British journalists are less likely to hand-wave away concerns about United States educational performance.<p>As a response to some comments here, I&#x27;ll note that I have lived in east Asia (I am a proficient speaker and reader of Chinese as a second language, and have lived in Taiwan during two three-year stays since I became an adult) and can verify that the schools there generally do a better job teaching mathematics (and also second languages) than the schools in the United States, at less expense per student. That efficiency in primary and secondary education lets both students who go on to higher education and students enter the workforce after secondary education achieve more in their adult pursuits than many Americans. Children there have childhoods with play and fun, but then they get to grow up to be adults with actual skills for advancing themselves.<p>For comparative rankings of different countries, showing how many more students in some countries reach high levels of mathematics achievement by eighth grade, see the very well constructed data chart &quot;Distribution of Mathematics Achievement&quot; for eighth graders in Exhibit 1.2 of Chapter 1 of the TIMSS report from the 2011 testing round.[2]<p>This issue is familiar to Americans like me who have lived overseas and have learned the local language of another country and have read the math textbooks available there. Better instruction can produce better educational results--and for less money besides. The top student issue is illustrated also by results from the International Mathematical Olympiad[3] and other international academic competitions. The United States has a huge population base, and it has many families in which the children are brought up by parents who are first-generation immigrants who received their own primary and secondary educations in other countries. (Such children do conspicuously well in academic competitions in the United States.) And the United States is wealthy, a heritage from the good governance structure set up by the United States federal Constitution. But even at that, the United States national team can be beat at the International Mathematical Olympiad by countries that have many fewer people and much poorer economies. Some countries have a very impressive group of top students.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hks.harvard.edu/pepg/PDF/Papers/PEPG14-01_NotJust.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/pepg/PDF/Papers/PEPG14-01_NotJust...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2011/downloads/T11_IR_M_Chapter1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2011/downloads/T11_IR_M_Cha...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.imo-official.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imo-official.org/</a>",1400696079

I admit that this is subtle, and I don&#x27;t fault you for seeing it immediately. If it were only true that Comcast was afraid of Netflix as a media competitor, then Comcast could <i>easily</i> beat Netflix at that game, and likely reap a few cost savings. So it&#x27;s not this. I suspect that at least some of the executives know that Comcast as a tv distributor is already a lost cause, and that this doesn&#x27;t bother them <i>too much</i>.<p>What does bother them is, having run the numbers, they realize that Netflix traffic will only continue growing, on a very steep curve.

7779784,comment,7778504,7779169,4,0,tzs,,,"> Seriously, it seems like the FCC just can&#x27;t be clear about what it is they actually plan to implement<p>Briefly, they HAD regulations that were working. These regulations were based on FCC authority under a particular section of law, which I&#x27;ll call Law X. Verizon and Comcast separately challenged different parts of the regulations and won in court. The court said Law X did not authorize the FCC to do all that had been doing. In particular, the banning of what people are now calling &quot;fast lanes&quot; was not allowed.<p>There is another law, law Y, that the FCC currently uses to regulate telephone service. This law is strong enough to ban fast lanes, but the consequences of using this more powerful weapon are unknown--for 30+ years data networks have been regulated under law X, not law Y. It is informally called &quot;the nuclear option&quot; because of this.<p>What Wheeler would like to do is restore the regulations that the court struck down, and would like to avoid having to use the nuclear option for this. For the &quot;fast lanes&quot;, he cannot outright ban them without going nuclear, so instead he&#x27;s proposing regulating them. For example, if an ISP gives a video service it or some related corporate entity owns a &quot;fast lane&quot;, it would have to offer similar service on &quot;commercially reasonable terms&quot; to outside video services. Also, demand for &quot;fast lanes&quot; could not be boosted by slowing people down--if your ISP sells you a service they claim is 20 mbit/second, for instance, they will be required to deliver that. They will not be allowed to slow you down to 10 mbit/second to make you complain to, say, Netflix, to encourage Netflix to pay for a &quot;fast lane&quot; on your ISP.<p>The tech press has done a terrible reporting job on this for the most part (Ars Technica seems to be the most accurate, and has published some accurate stories). They like to report it as Wheeler proposing to allow &quot;fast lanes&quot;, in a way that implies &quot;fast lanes&quot; are new. In fact, under the regulations in effect now that the court struck down the earlier regulations, &quot;fast lanes&quot; are allowed, with no restrictions at all. Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;commercially reasonable terms&quot; proposal is an attempt to put some limits on the &quot;fast lanes&quot;.<p>Wheeler has always said that other options are on the table. That&#x27;s why the proposal came with a bunch of questions about whether this was the right approach, and whether the nuclear option should be pursued. It is very common for proposed regulations to change significantly as a result of the feedback during the comment period. There is no reason to think that will not happen here.",1400695856

Eight words -- eight <i>syllables</i> -- laying bare why so many engineers tend to have such a hard time dealing with politics and people, on every scale from the picayune to the planetary. I&#x27;ve never seen it put so succinctly.<p>I&#x27;m still baffled as to why it&#x27;s such a common problem, though. The essence of our shared discipline is to bridge the gap between a perfect idea and an imperfect world. This being the case, in our professional lives we must either be capable of recognizing and accepting such imperfection, or be incompetent; there is no third way.<p>So why is it that, in the interpersonal realm, so many of us prefer to demand impossible perfection than to exercise the same capacity that serves us so well in the technical work of our field? There&#x27;s no sensible way of understanding how the imperfect human world works, save to begin by redressing ignorance through observation. Instead, many of us (some days, I think, <i>most</i> of us) flee into any number of idiosyncratic political fantasies -- just-so stories about how that world <i>should</i> work -- and refuse outright even to consider the possible value of discovering how that world <i>does</i> work.<p>Such refusal hampers us in any number of ways, professionally and otherwise; three of the former sort, right off the top of my head, are office politics, client interaction, and user interface design. Engineers are, of course, famously incompetent in all these areas, and unlike a lot of stereotypes, this one I&#x27;ve observed to be much more often accurate than otherwise.

When you are watching a movie with subtitles, but have absolutely no idea what is being said in the movie because the spoken language is unknown to you, it can be very distracting, because you are missing a certain amount of context. I believe an above-average amount of Dutch people is at least capable of comprehending basic English speech, which puts the movie&#x27;s subtitles into context. In countries where English isn&#x27;t as wide-spread, this is more problematic, which is why dubbing is more effective there. Similarly, even in the Netherlands movies which target family audiences are often shown dubbed by default in movie theatres, because the subtitles are just not as effective even if the children that are watching the movie can read them.",1400695253

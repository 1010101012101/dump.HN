Digg and Reddit are both victims of their own success.  Once you start getting traffic, you start getting page rank.  And, once you get page rank, your outgoing links are that much more valuable, and there is a greater incentive to game the system.<p>I think that safeguards need to be at least thought about to try and keep the quality of the site up.

I'm sure there were a lot of greek tragedies that flopped.<p>If movies don't make money, they can't be made. So people don't get to watch them for free off the pirate bay. Hollywood needs to find ways to charge for and deliver content in a way that people are willing to pay for and consume. What they don't need is to go off and start trying to find crazy ways of making money on the internet.

I had thought it might be that it coerces the right hand side to match the left's type, but it doesn't since:<p>null==0 || 0==null -> false<p>It's weird for number/string comparisons, too. ""12"" is greater than ""102"" (lexical ordering, ""2"" > ""0"") but less than 102 (coerces ""12"" to number).<p>It seems like if one side is a number, then it coerces the other one to number as well, <i>unless</i> the other is null.<p>Which makes sense given what it was designed for, since any attribute you pull in from a DOM element will be a string, and you want to make forgetting to convert safe.",1203725526

If the thought of switching editors doesn’t fill you with quite a bit of dread, what you’re using now is almost certainly underpowered, and you definitely haven’t customized it enough. If this is you, take a look at one of the editors I’ve been discussing here, and take the time to learn it–I promise it’s worth the trouble. Just, uh…choose carefully.</i>",1203725014

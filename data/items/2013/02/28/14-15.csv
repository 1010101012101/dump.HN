Politicians need to feel the pain of paying for their delusionary spending ahead of the need in order to ensure that they don't spend what we don't have or what we can't afford.  What a concept: Want a new program? Save the money you'll need for the first five years of operation and then we can talk about it.  Programs have been rolled out with no runway whatsoever and counting on sucking more money out of taxpayers to cover the holes.  If the post office didn't have to face the reality of funding these insanely ridiculous government pensions my kids and their kids and maybe one more generation after that would have to pay taxes to provide postal workers with nearly a full salary for the rest of their lives.

He thinks attempts to ""Secure Boot"" a loader which then allows arbitrary code execution are a waste of time, and they are.  If you don't want boot time signature verification, you should turn it off, not break the chain of trust.<p>In fact, done right, perhaps hardware vendors that currently only provide binary blobs could be coerced into providing source.

Same reason why you can't just shoot something into orbit from Earth's surface with one instantaneous acceleration, and that getting into orbit is not merely a matter of standing on a very tall tower.<p>Truly enormous impacts can change the rules if thing hitting Mars is large enough to shift the center of mass of the whole system.

A few months in, I was tasked to our largest project (and the largest decommissioning project in the US), and traveled back and forth each week.<p>As someone on the go, I thought it was a good idea to keep the source code for that app on my flash drive (there was no Github back then). For 6 months I worked directly on that flash drive, adding new features to support the large project, and expanding the abilities of the application to gain us even more favor. One day, I plugged in the flash drive and Windows gave the warning that it was corrupt and needed to be formatted. Immediately my heart sank, and the drive was indeed dead. My last backup was about 3 months old, and didn't even include some resources like icons and graphics.<p>Long story short, I had to sit there for weeks and re-code everything I'd lost, using the latest release as a reference to what was missing. On the plus side, my design was probably better the second time around, but nobody was pleased that any new releases would be delayed a month at least.<p>I now keep that flash drive, still in its corrupt state, as a permanent fixture on all the desks I've worked at since. It's a constant reminder to not be stupid when it comes to time-expensive intellectual property.",1362061329

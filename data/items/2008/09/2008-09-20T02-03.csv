Ordinary claims are ordinary because they are well proven and well known and don't need re-evaluated every time.<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence precisely because because they haven't been proven.  Claiming the Earth was round was at one time extraordinary, it no longer is.  Claiming you met God however, is still an extraordinary claim and as such still requires extraordinary evidence.<p>Stating that the same level of proof is required for each one ignores the reality of the history of the claim.",1221876547

Why?  Integer linear programming is in NP-complete, still there are at least countably infinitely many integer linear programs that can solve just by inspection.  There may be a simple solution the OP's question.<p>More generally, that a problem X is and example of a class of problems in NP-complete doesn't mean that problem X is difficult to solve.  In particular, integer linear programming problems are common in production and scheduling in business; for some of them, can get solutions; for some of them, the solutions are valuable for the business.<p>E.g., once I had a 0-1 integer linear programming problem with 40,000 constraints and 600,000 variables.  In 905 seconds on a 90 MHz PC (yes, Virginia, at one time that was considered a fast computer!) I found a feasible solution and showed that its objective function value had to be within 0.025% of optimality.  Then once when discussing design of IP networks in Plano, TX, some people concluded that I must be fibbing because integer linear programming is in NP-complete.  No fibbing.  Not all integer linear programming problems are difficult.  Besides, likely I didn't find an optimal solution, just a solution close to optimality.  But for a related point, in business being close to optimality might save nearly all the money and be plenty good.<p>Moral:  That a practical problem is in NP-complete (in the sense of the OP) is no reason to give up on the problem.",1363867018

They were two friends talking amongst themselves.<p>Which still wouldn't be acceptable, except they weren't actually saying anything offensive per se. Your charge is that they're creating an environment where women feel unwelcome, one in which they feel uncomfortable because it is implied that the audience is male (I'm assuming you agree with the article you linked). But the thing is, the entire audience was composed of males because the entire audience was limited to the one person each man was talking to. It's impossible to make the claim that they're alienating people by creating an implied homogeneous culture when they're speaking privately.<p>Think about a comparable situation. If a man is reading in a break room with two women talking to each other about how periods suck, are they alienating him? Are they creating an environment in which in which one has to be a biologically typical female under the age of 45 to feel accepted? Or are they just talking about issues which affect them and not worrying about who might be eavesdropping? It should be obvious that it is the latter. The case in which Adria is involved is no different.

Upon arrest, the criminal will usually be ""booked in"" at the local police station but then transported back to one of the original force's police stations for processing.
Criminal law is the same across the country, so there is no sense of different jurisdictions.

I had misinterpreted it to be something sexual and so I assumed they were laughing at something they also didn't understand. I yelled at them and then asked them if they knew what they were talking about... Long story short. I got in trouble for sexual harassment. I felt awful for my behavior and apologized to the kids after I realized I acted improperly too.<p>In response to the dongle comments.

However, they were sitting in a room with others sitting nearby that could hear them. Regardless of what they were saying they were being disrespectful by distracting other attendees.<p>My point? 1) Be careful not to be the one incorrectly applying sexual context to overheard words or conversations. 2) be cognizant of your surroundings and aware of how your conversation could be perceived in public settings. 3) be respectful.",1363864597

Talking about ""root causes"" of inequalities is only a method by which one denigrates the actual fight against inequality itself.  There are countless deep and abiding inequalities which one can argue back and forth indefinitely about their origins, and this is especially true in questions of gendered inequality.  Is this, that, or the other thing responsible?  Here's an idea: who gives a shit?  I no longer do.<p>For example, take the issue which finally broke my ability to take feminism: male rape victimization.  Where does the purposeful ignoring of male rape victims come from?  Feminists (when they admit that male rape victims exist in substantial quantities and deserve to be mentioned) would argue that the gender system produced by the Patriarchy refuses to recognize men as potential victims because that would feminize them and weaken their social position.  Men's Rights Activists would argue that it is because our society systematically refuses to recognize male victimhood, period.  I think the latter is a better position to take.  The simplest explanation is best, and the solution is far clearer: stop that.<p>>If you're really interested in enhancing equality as a social good, you would do better to champion the cause of equality that is blind to biological and socioeconomic factors<p>There are issues that require a specificity of gender because they affect a specific gender.  Discussing the development of a growth mindset in mathematics does require some discussion of gender because women and girls are much less likely to be encouraged to develop a growth mindset.  Discussing rape certainly requires discussion of gender, since rape is considered as a gendered crime and the sex of the perpetrator and victim hugely affect how it is perceived.  Discussion of virtually every single issue that the MRM touches upon requires a discussion of gender since they are about gender.  When cops choose to apply different standards to men and women, you have to look at gender.  Paternity fraud requires that one look at sex in order to be discussed because it only directly affects one.  There are times and places where pretending that everything is solved is the optimal solution to a given problem; there are also times and places where it is not.<p>The idea that one should ignore socioeconomic and biological factors in championing the cause of equality is systematically wrong.  Sometimes people suffer specifically because they are men.  Sometimes they suffer specifically because they are women.  You have to discuss this or you might as well not discuss anything at all.",1363864439

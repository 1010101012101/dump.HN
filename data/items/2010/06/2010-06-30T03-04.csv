If they're to make an exception for this, then in the interest of avoiding fragmentation they won't be making an exception for the Ruby language in the abstract; rather they'll be making the exception for the MacRuby implementation in particular.  MacRuby is a unique implementation, and programming Cocoa through MacRuby is vastly different (and incompatible) experience from programming Cocoa on other OS X Ruby implementations.<p>Given that MacRuby is not considered ""stable"" just yet, the time is not right for Apple to provide an exception to 3.3.1 for Ruby programming.

For example, how are you going to tell the difference between a environmentally net negative windfarm investment that only exists to help itself to government subsidies and tax treatments, with a windfarm that is a net positive in terms of environment and investment cashflow?<p>My advice would be to optimise your investing strategy while ignoring the actual investment vehicle, then putting the returns to work in a way that you can see the direct results. You can avoid companies that truly offend you if you must. So invest in a financial services/ IT company that produces the returns you need, then spend those returns on an environmental/social improvement project in your local area, whether it is a pollution cleanup or a skill training centre.

While it is certainly true to some extent, truly great wine comes from truly great vineyards, which are in limited supply due to the exact agricultural/climatic conditions required to grow them.  Also, expensive wines such as Champagne which take a long time to make are still very much a hand-made product.<p>None of these applies to cultivation of pot, even the more exotic varieties.  As it can be successfully grown indoors, the conditions for creating it can be created just about anywhere.  There is none or very little post-processing involved and the supply chain is astonishingly short.<p>So I think the comparison to things like wine and coffee are incorrect, as these 'commodities' actually require exact growing conditions and post-processing to get high quality results.<p>A better comparison would be tomatoes.  There is very little price difference between the cheapest tomato and the most expensive, highest quality, organically grown version.

1473795,comment,1472648,1473090,0,0,quan,,,"I used to daytrade IPOs like crazy during the 2006-2008 period. From what I read from the many IPO boards that I participated, you need to have an account with the underwriters of the IPO in order to get allocation. Usually, these premium accounts have higher fee and your balance must be above some amount ($50k-$100k). When there's an IPO you can ask for shares, and the underwriters use this information to gauge how hot the IPO is and adjust the offer price. When they allocate you shares, you can decide to take it or not. Some people say they rank you based on how often you fulfill your promise, so if you always ask for shares but seldom buy you won't get allocations for hot IPO.<p>I don't have these types of accounts so I never get pre-IPO allocation, but what I did on IPO day was continuously refreshing the page to catch when it's first open (IPO usually open b/w 10am-12:00). You can almost always buy at lower price than the offer price within the first 15 minutes. Most IPOs (~80%) close lower than the offer price on the first day, and they continue to go down after that, you don't want to touch these. The remaining 20% are hot, and you know they're hot b/c the underwriters keep bumping the offer price up. I only played these and for very short term, from only a few minutes to a few days.<p>I'd time when the price starts bouncing back after the first 15 minutes, probably b/c more people realizing the stock is opened to the public and buy in, and buy 300-400 shares. After about 20 minutes of insane rising, the price will start to level out. At this point, I'd sell half of the shares to lock in the profit (~5% gain). I'd keep the rest for the next day, if the stock closes lower than open price then it shows weakness, I'd get out and never look at it again. If it's higher, I'd keep it for 2-3 more days.<p>With this strategy I was able to make a lot more than my day job. There used to be 7-8 IPOs every week, and a couple of those are hot so I was able to test this strategy for awhile. There were weeks that I made 20% on a position just over a few days (if I remember correctly the IPO was STV). There haven't been a lot IPOs since then and I haven't followed the market lately. May be it's time to start watching again.",1277868584

I can't talk about ITA specific info, but I can talk in general terms about knowledge that is public in the airline industry. Generally speaking, if you wanted to do what ITA does, you'd have to get three types of data: (1) schedules, (2) fares and fare rules, and (3) availability data.<p>Getting (1) and (2) is relatively simple since there are special clearinghouses where airlines publish their schedule and fare data. ATPCO does fares and I've forgotten the name of the organization that handles SSIMs for schedules but in either case, you pay for a subscription and they make data available to you. Simple. Except for the fact that the protocols used to transmit the data are baroque and painful, the data itself has all kinds of data quality issues, and airlines are really really dumb when it comes to thinking about the semantics of what they're trying to convey.<p>Specifically, airline standards groups typically go nuts specifying syntax while completely ignoring semantics. The result is that lots of carriers are ""standards compliant"" but functionally unable to communicate. There are a lot of N squared implementations in the industry (i.e., every carrier that needs to talk to each other writes custom code to talk to every other carrier).<p>The nice thing about (1) and (2) is that we're talking about relatively static data that is updated infrequently; many systems process fare data on a daily basis for example. You may wonder: how can this be since airline prices vary rapidly even within the same day? The answer boils down to availability data (3), which changes extremely rapidly. A rule of thumb is that you might see one availability change per flight segment per second. Getting access to (3) is a good deal harder than (1) or (2). Typically, it involves talking directly with carriers or with the more sophisticated carrier alliances that are smart enough to pool infrastructure for their members. Alternatively, one can buy access from various global distribution systems (Sabre, Galileo, Amadeus, etc.) but this can be a very very expensive proposition. Plus, if you're buying availability data from a GDS, odds are good that you're competing with them, which doesn't give them much incentive to play nice.<p>There are all sorts of problems you need to solve to do what ITA does, but for a host of reasons I won't go into, availability is the hardest.<p>As for when they were just starting, I wasn't there, but  based on later conversations, I can say that Carl and Jeremy (ITA founders) were just incredibly gutsy. And shockingly smart. And really lucky. They threw something together that was complete crap but managed to impress some industry people just enough to offer them a static data file. They had no idea how to read the damn thing so they made some educated guesses and demoed a search engine using it to the industry folks, who compared the demo results to their own internal system. Obviously, they got lots of stuff wrong, but they got enough right to really impress some of the staff who then started giving them data dictionaries, etc. The rest is history.",1277866968

A lot of people who are enthusiastic about writers know two or three names of writers they follow, and that's it. Everything outside of that is an unknown to them. The first part of the solution is to focus people who are enthusiastic about writing in one place.<p>The next fix is to let writers release fast, iterate often, similar to hackers, and that means critique. You need to give them a good system for getting lots of feedback fast. The minute they start writing they should have <i>access</i> to feedback, even if they choose to finish a first draft before releasing anything and showing it to people. The better your revision access is, the less of a risk it is.<p>The final solution is to publish more writers, more incrementally. It means that you sift through a lot of short stories and poems and yes, even novels, if you're a publishing company, and you <i>get back</i> to everybody so that they can figure out how to get better. At the same time, you expand aggressively so that you can handle the incoming people as your model expands outward, and you keep the focus on quality publishing, just <i>more</i> of it.<p>Also, computer-based vocalization is horrible, and it will never replace audiobooks. I want Steven Colbert reading to me, not my Kindle.",1235577581

The client side js simply needs to know how to process the json it's given, it doesn't need to know any business/persistence info.<p>What I'm curious about is how he handles urls (if everything is xhr, then the url will always stay the same, which is kind of a pain for linking to specific stuff, unless you do anchor workarounds like Facebook does). Also, I'd be curious if he uses the static html files as templates (injecting data into them clientside) or just has a TON of tiny html fragments.",1235577291

Really? The second the first recording company came into business it was making 18 billion a year? I'm fairly sure it's still higher than throughout most of the history of the recording industry.<p>""Unfortunately The Pirate Bay does what it says in its description and its main aim is to make available unauthorized material."" No, its main aim is to facilitate the sharing of files. The users choose to upload illegal material.<p>""It is common sense, if they couldn’t get it for free they would buy it and when we ask them, they confirm that."" Prove it. I download plenty of music to see if it's any good, sometimes via youtube, sometimes via torrents. Probably at least 95% isn't, so I delete it again. I certainly wouldn't buy it.<p>""When asked if downloaders have less money than others, Kennedy said that younger people have the money but just don’t spend it on music anymore. Kennedy said that the reduction in sales in the music industry is directly attributable to illegal downloading."" Again, PROVE IT. I  suspect that if you put music sales next to video game sales you'll see some very close correlation between the decline of the former and the rise of the latter.<p>""He was asked if he understood BitTorrent. [...] It was very clear he knew nothing about any remotely technical issues."" Perhaps you could spend 10 minutes reading up on it so you know what you're talking about in a court of law?<p>""The reason for this drop is that the number of premieres have increased but sales have decreased. File-sharing has somewhat made the market thinner."" Or maybe people have only a limited budget for movies, so now they have to split it between them, resulting in lower sales per movie? Or you just make too many crappy movies? Again, get some proof.<p>""Sandgren further told that the damages they claim are based on a fictitious license fee."" So basically they're just pulling numbers out of their ass.<p>""He had to admit, however, that he has no evidence to back these claims up."" I'm not even going to comment on this one.<p>If only I were the judge... I'd hold them in contempt of the court for wasting everyone's time with unsubstantiated BS. Or better yet, sue the entertainment industry because they cost me several billion dollars. How did I arrive at that figure? Well, I have no evidence to back that claim up, but it seems reasonable to me. Now give me my money.<p>Pathetic.",1235576975

The reason that our borders aren't wider open to the world's ""best and brightest"" is 2-fold.<p>1) Current American immigration is saturated by the world's worst and dumbest. Low-IQ immigrants contribute marginally to GDP and are a huge drain on social resources. Look at the modern equivalent of white flight going on in California and what it's doing to state budgets. Insane family reunification policies exacerbate this. The fix: build a fence on our southern border, and we'll have a lot more capacity to import skilled labor.<p>2) Europe is unfortunately reproducing at low levels (just like WASPs in America, in case you didn't know).

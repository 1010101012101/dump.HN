7829355,comment,7828530,7829035,5,0,twic,,,"Actually, yes. JPQL, the generally SQL-like query language in the Java Persistence API, lets you write joins through foreign key references (as most joins are, although of course not all) as if they were object property references. So instead of:<p><pre><code>  select u.user_id\n  from User u\n   join Company c using (company_id)\n   join Country k using (country_id)\n  where k.code = &#x27;br&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nYou would write something like:<p><pre><code>  select u from User u where u.company.country.code = &#x27;br&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s pretty neat. I wish i could do that in SQL.<p>If you want to fetch data from joined entities, then you still need to name them in an explicit join, but it&#x27;s still easier than in SQL:<p><pre><code>  select u, k.code from User u join u.company.country k where u.creation_date = current_date</code></pre>",1401634735

It&#x27;s hard to reason about the creation of dynamic queries, say, for some types of searches. It&#x27;s not reasonable to create a generic function that can operate on any same-shaped piece of data. And it&#x27;s ridiculously hard to manage the concept of a pointer to a piece of data which could be one of many types, a problem I&#x27;m sure most people have faces.<p>Stored procedures can help with some of this, but then you&#x27;ve got to remember to update them every time you need to access data in a slightly different way, and it&#x27;s hard to figure out when you can get rid of old stored procedures. Tools for managing them aren&#x27;t up to scratch with tools for managing &quot;real&quot; programs.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m keen on RethinkDB. It&#x27;s a document-oriented NoSQL database which doesn&#x27;t lose your data, has built-in clustering, and an extremely strong query language built on chaining method calls.

Further your point about &quot;1/8, 0.35 and 50%&quot; is too elementary for the 7th grade.  Uh, at one time I was in the 6th grade, and the 7th, and even, could one believe, the 8th and do remember some of it!<p>My 7th grade teacher was quite comfortable giving that little puzzle problem and letting the class spend the whole period on it.  It was a good little lesson.<p>It appears from this thread and some other sources, e.g., from\nNorth Carolina, that probability is too difficult \nfor most of the K-12 faculty.  So, I gave some easy lessons\non how to teach elementary probability.<p>I&#x27;ve been a student, am well qualified in probability, and\nhave done a lot of teaching.  I know fairly well what the heck\nI&#x27;m talking about.<p>Sorry, but that 7th grade teacher was not doing well.<p>Also the remarks above in this thread -- I tried to be nice\nand not mention them -- on &quot;continuous probabilities&quot;\nand &quot;fuzzy&quot; need to be flushed:  Some probability distributions are continuous, but the &#x27;probabilities&#x27; themselves are not.  That is, we know in very fine detail just what &#x27;continuous&#x27; means and what a &#x27;probability&#x27; is, and &#x27;continuous&#x27; does not apply to a &#x27;probability&#x27;.<p>Further,\n&#x27;fuzzy&#x27; is from a quite different subject.  Saying &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; seems\nto imply that maybe some probabilities do not really exist;\nno, this is a fundamental error, and quite serious.  Instead,\nwith meager assumptions we can assume that probabilities\nalways exist; the issue, then, can be finding numerical\nvalues for the probabilities, and for that we usually have\nto make an &#x27;estimate&#x27; and that is mostly in the field\nof statistics and usually makes use of at least the\nweak law of large numbers.  That we have to make an\nestimate does not justify &#x27;fuzzy&#x27;.<p>From the OP, I can believe that the 7th grade students\nare up to understanding probability but that the OP\nis not and is not up to teaching it.  Sorry &#x27;bout that.<p>It appears that the K-12 teachers have been in an echo \nchamber far too far from the solid material in US \nuniversities and now are frequently circling their\nwagons to defend themselves from attacks on their,\nlet me pick the right word, incompetence.  Instead, the\nteachers should learn some probability.  I suggest\ntexts by M. Loeve (long at Berkeley), J. Neveu (from Paris and a Loeve student), K. Chung (long at Stanford), L. Breiman (a Loeve student and long at Berkeley),\nor E. Cinlar (long at Princeton)?  To read these texts,\nstart with, say, W. Rudin, &#x27;Principles of Mathematical\nAnalysis&#x27; (at least once used in Harvard&#x27;s Math 55), the first half of W. Rudin, &#x27;Real and Complex\nAnalysis&#x27;, and H. Royden, &#x27;Real Analysis&#x27;.  Royden was long at Stanford.  To read those\nbooks, be a college math major in a good program.<p>Then we can talk more about probability and how to\nteach it.  In the meanwhile, if I had a student in\nthat 7th grade class, I&#x27;d insist to the principal that\nthe class receive some competent instruction in \nprobability from a different teacher.<p>Probability is a nice subject, and it is possible to\ndo a good job with an elementary introduction, but \nthe OP showed that the content of the teaching\nwas a mess.  E.g., there was &quot;percent probabilities&quot; and &quot;theoretical probability&quot;,\nand the informed mind boggles.  With such teaching, \nprobability will be several times more difficult than\nnecessary; with such teaching, the students \nare done real harm and later will have to &quot;unlearn what\nyou have learned&quot;.  So, the teaching is not just babysitting\nbut harmful babysitting.<p>And we pay real estate taxes for such garbage?<p>Am I making myself more clear?",1401633486

I&#x27;ve also worked with tons of other languages, frameworks and environments (e.g. Python, Django, Express, Racket/Scheme). Most recently I was at TechStars for their hackstar/hacker in residence program. The work I did there included projects like monitoring pages for Docker instances for a Docker hosting company & private data repositories for a Github for scientific data company. Prior to TechStars I did a full re-write of a production storage & logistics app for a 5 year old business while simultaneously teaching the entrepreneur to code & teaching him Ruby/Rails. That project also included an Angular.js app. I&#x27;m also very excited about Ember.js.<p>Typically I work full stack. I have practiced TDD in the past but usually I code first & then write tests that leave me confident essential use cases & core functionality are covered. 100% test coverage is a great idea but I am not accustomed to the type of deadlines or large teams that facilitate 100% test coverage actually happening.<p>The one thing I value in code above all else (other than the code actually working and meeting your deadline) is readability. If you can read & understand the code base, you can optimize it when necessary and you can fix bugs when necessary. Coders should be good communicators.

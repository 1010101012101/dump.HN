2231109,story,,,1,0,bdmorgan,"Image licensing?",,"I'm working on a site specifically focused on NFL and college football now.  As I look around at various blogs and smaller sites, I see images of Tom Brady, Cam Newton, etc. that I'm assuming the sites just pulled from Google Images or something.  On the other hand, if I take a look at what it costs to actually license images from a service such as Getty, it seems prohibitive for any startup.  So, at his point, I'm really confused as to what to do.  Are 98% of the sites out there just displaying images with no regard to licensing (and, evidently, no legal action is being pursued)?  Is this a ""better to beg forgiveness than ask permission"" type of thing?  ...Or is there some fabulous free image archive that I've yet to find?",1297954670
2231108,comment,2230710,2230710,0,0,cletus,,,"30% is simply an unsustainable cut of many things, of which music subscriptions are just one example.<p>I've said before--and I stand by the statement--that Apple doesn't have a lot of wiggle-room here without disrupting their retail channel for iTunes cards, which (IMHO) is a really important competitive advantage they have over, say, Android.<p>Having the retail credit channel is the equivalent of the importance of having prepay options for cell phones vs postpay. Many people don't want to put CC info in iTunes or they simply want to give gift cards to kids.<p>What Apple should do is make such a service optional. If it's compelling, people will use it. I also believe that for some people this will be compelling because they then don't have to deal with billing and all the infrastructure (payment gateways, receipts, accounts departments and so forth) that that entails.<p>Forcing it down people's throats is another matter entirely.<p>It's still unclear how this will relate to the Kindle, which is really what interests me, as it is a mix of subscriptions and single-purchase publications, all of which are purchased outside of the App Store.<p>Part of the problem is that there is an internal inconsistency in play. You can subscribe to the Wall Street Journal Web edition and use that on Safari on your iPad just fine. Why should the WSJ app that gives you access to that same content be any different?<p>You could sell an app on the App Store for $10 and Apple would get their $3 cut. Give a free version away and offer a $10 in-app upgrade and Apple still gets their $3 cut. From Apple's perspective, why are subscriptions any different?<p>I guess Apple are seeing this as people making money off their platform so they should get a cut. That position has superficial attractions but quickly breaks down if you go deeper.<p>To me it's a lot like the ISPs who want to charge Netflix or Google for all the bandwidth they use, which is nothing more than double-dipping. The customer pays for the bandwidth. What they use that bandwidth for should be immaterial to the ISP.<p>Personally I think Apple makes enough money from selling the devices, the App Store and iTunes that just nickel-and-diming people who produce material users subscribe to to the point of excluding such content from the device is really not in their interest or the user's interest.<p>Not having Grooveshark on my iPhone/iPad is a problem (that predates this). Losing other music services will be a problem. Losing the Kindle will be a HUGE problem.",1297954668

Where will you test? No local dev servers, really?<p>Besides that, Azure is NOT usage payed, Azure is an approximation to that I would call scalable server rental. You pay by time and size, not by use.\nMaybe that explains Azure's momentum, they're getting things right and discouraging people by having expensive/inadequate prices. I hope they get it right soon, and that they start billing by usage.<p>I do .Net at an agency and I like it but it's amazing how much noise there is in the Microsoft ecossystem.",1297954637

The model object dispatches events which the view listens to and updates its own representation. In Flex the model object is often an ""ArrayCollection,"" in this example, ""Donuts."" In Flex the view would often be some kind of ""List"" object, in this example, ""DonutCollectionView.""<p>The Donut aspect of this example is the contrived bit. It's just a generic list. Donut could just be any Object that maps to some kind of HTML representation. DonutCollectionView could just be a CollectionView, that passes along that representation to a HTML list.<p>The plumbing in this example is something I don't really want to write if I am using a framework.

You don't have to appeal to everyone or the population average. You can start appealing to outliers in terms of viral spread (""Sure, I'll RT that I'm looking for a boyfriend, why wouldn't I?"") and hope they have friends in the wider population.<p>2). Scalable content generation, the technique for all seasons when coming from behind in SEO.  ""online dating"" is competitive, ""20-something white guys in Ogaki"" is not.  Local search optimization for dating is an angle, although I know it has been plumbed before quite deeply (welcome to <i>everything</i> about this space).<p>3) See the OKCupid link bait?  Think you could come up with similarly juicy headlines without the data?  I'm thinking the answer is ""yes"", since Cosmo has done it for years.  Twenty Reasons Guys Don't Date Smart Women, etc.  (It <i>will</i> spread.)<p>4). Find an enemy, manufacturing them if necessary.  If your marketing generates an emotional response it is less likely to fall into the background.  A previously successful strategy for many dating sites has been ""The world and our competitors won't let X do Y but we're different and love will win out, booyah.""<p>5).  Everybody in this space plays dirty.  If you can't see the bloody knives in any competitor's hands, that is only because they're buried so deep in the body of everything right and good in the world.  You will stoop to their level - and then some, because incumbents hold al the cards and their sins are buried in Google backups whereas yours will be fresh in Matt Cutts' inbox.  You will be dancing on the knife's edge until you get your site burned to the ground, or you will never have enough traffic for that to even matter.<p>Seriously, do you <i>really</i> want to do online dating?",1297952033

This is a really tough one that most start-ups don’t have, and you can’t just change strategies to get one.  If your venture is not built off of some protectable and scalable technology, VCs won’t usually be interested.  It is conceivable that in the right type of business you could build barriers to entry if you are a well-funded first-mover, but it is quite rare that that will suffice.""<p>Nonsense:  The author and UNC B-school people have been sitting too long in their small, dark offices with the door and blinds closed engaging in intellectual self-abuse imagining how things are.  Instead, what is much closer to being true is:<p>For ""protectable and scalable technology"" ('secret sauce') for ""competitive advantage"", ""VCs won’t usually be interested"".<p>As a parody, for investors, secret sauce and a dime won't cover a ten cent cup of coffee.  Some ""protectable and scalable technology"" and some customer 'traction' are not nearly as good as just some customer 'traction'!<p>Or, without knowing it, the investors believe in Markov processes:  For predicting the future of the business, customer traction is as good as customer traction and secret sauce.  More technically, the future of the business and secret sauce are conditionally independent given customer traction.<p>In particular, the investors will not do any competent or reliable expert technical review of any claims of any ""protectable and scalable technology"".<p>Why?  (A) Actually investors do not know how to do or even direct such a review (they aren't editors in chief of peer-reviewed journals).  (B) They make decisions quickly without the time of such reviews.  (C) They see so few deals with important secret sauce that they choose to neglect any such secret sauce.  (D) The big wins they see had little or no valuable secret sauce.  (E) Secret sauce technology has a bad reputation as generalized, useless academic nonsense solutions looking for problems.  (F) Claims about secret sauce investors can't evaluate can make investors feel inadequate, and investors like to feel that they are 'on top of and better than' the entrepreneurs and not anything like 'inadequate'.<p>Here in principle the investors are badly wrong; secret sauce can be fantastically valuable.  In practice the investors are somewhat wrong.  Still, the most successful investors are not very technical people (that's being generous) and are making money anyway.<p>If there is some powerful, valuable, difficult to duplicate or equal secret sauce, then there is a chance that the secret sauce will be the difference between just some good, early traction and a really solid, valuable business; in this case, good for the entrepreneur; but with the claims of secret sauce the investors will try not to be offended and try to look just at 'traction' anyway.<p>The article also describes ""funding stages"":<p>o ""$1M early stage round to get to prototype or perhaps get first customers;<p>o ""a year later, another round of $3-5M to test the business model and whether it can scale, milestones of $1M in sales or some of customers;<p>o ""then maybe 18 months later, $5-10M to go BIG and try to position yourself for an 'exit' (sale of company or IPO).""<p>I don't think so!<p>So, my guess about the funding stages is:<p>(0) Pre-Seed Stage.<p>If there is no prototype Web site an investor can connect to and ""play with"", then the project is regarded as ""just an idea"" and ""Ideas are easy and plentiful"", that is, worthless.  No chance of a check.<p>(1) Seed Stage.<p>The prototype Web site works, and investors can connect to it and evaluate the user interface and user experience.  If everything looks good or promising, then maybe write a seed check for $25,000 to $1 million.<p>(2) Series A.<p>If there are users and the number of users per month is increasing quickly, and even better if there is some revenue, then write a Series A check for $1 million to $5 million.<p>(3) Series B.<p>If the 'traction' is growing like a weed on MiracleGro, and/or so are revenue and earnings, and if the M&A or IPO situation looks promising, then write a Series B check, maybe for $10 million to $20 million, or more in extreme cases or if the founders want to 'take some cash off the table'.<p>From all I can see, these are the criteria.  They are simple enough that could teach a dog to do it in a weekend.  My guess is that the criteria are what are wanted by the major limited partners.  Since the major limited partners have no real control over some of the angel investors, the angels are free to have their own criteria.<p>Let's see:  The article was from Duke, right?  As I recall, there was a coed there with hots for the Lacrosse team?  Are we getting a consistent pattern about the seriousness of Duke?",1297951460

For example, <i>non-member non-friend classes are often more OO than putting everything into the class</i>[1]. Furthermore, if you want to use function overloading for multiple dispatch, the keeping the functions separate from the objects is also useful. If your system is highly concurrent, keeping the code and data separate can be quite helpful. Also keeping data in structure-of-arrays form and using external functions to operate on these arrays can make huge differences in terms of cache usage, potential parallelism and vectorization of instructions.<p>Coupling <i>might</i> be a reason to do this, but its certainly not the first reason I think of. There are plenty of better reasons (and as always, not all reasons apply to all codebases).<p>TL;DR: There are lots of reasons why doing this could be a good thing.<p>(fwiw, I like to do this with my core data structures because I believe code and data should be kept separate (and that data is the more important of the two). I <i>do</i> like to provide <i>normal</i> objects as an API though, because I often feel that its a natural interface, but the internals of my code are rarely very OO in the C++/Java sense).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/084.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/084.htm</a>",1297951290

All the benefits you name pale in comparison to the benefits (or loss savings) of paying down the debt. If we proceeded on a Mars colony now, the US would likely slip into a Greater Depression before we could reap a benefit large enough to prevent that. Due in part to those wars we&#x27;re too close to the abyss. The best choice is to get away from the abyss before focusing attention elsewhere.",1371977958

With his worldwide recognition: the safest course would be for him to publicly turn himself in to a US police station or deliver himself to a courtroom. He would have a very public trial and would have an even farther reaching message in this country. By running he shows that he has no faith in this country and no longer considers himself a citizen. Not only that but he opens himself up to a ridiculous amount of risk by being wide open in foreign countries where things are semi-expected to happen to travelers by this country. If something happens to him while he&#x27;s in the legal system of this country, the people responsible for him would be crucified by the media and everyone else. Granted he could be silenced and have his reputation destroyed by the media while incarcerated in this country but I believe a patriot works with the system or fights within it, only a coward runs.",1371977750

But it also doesn&#x27;t apply to so many things that are regularly posted here and nobody ever hears a peep about, often minor iteration of some shallow cosmetic &quot;technology&quot;, and generally ads thinly veiled under bad writing. I mean, if the standards are that low, why not simply declare that humans are biological machines, and therefore all human interest stories are technology stories? But don&#x27;t pretend there is consistency and actual adherence to the guidelines, I just don&#x27;t see it. Maybe the problem is that it would require us first to define &quot;good hacker&quot;.

But surely that isn&#x27;t it, so what <i>is</i> it...?<p>I would love to see a &quot;main section&quot; restricted to big ideas or questions, instead of news of the day, something that strictly tries to adhere to those guidelines -- but I would still want to have an area where we can discuss Snowden, or some random thing that existed for ages predictably being converted to js now, in a format that is purely focused on the words, and with people that are generally extremely smart.

I think that there are still many older people, and young people who do not have accounts on sites like github, they have nothing to show. But may be reasonable candidates to hire because of their technical talent. I think it&#x27;s appropriate to ask questions to an interviewee based on the domain knowledge you&#x27;d expect them to have during an interview. These involve little things that are very typical of day-to-day work. These are the type of things I&#x27;d ask over the phone or email. Once you determine they are not blowing smoke up your rear, ask them to come in for a more formal person-to-person interview.<p>I then ask them a fairly broad open-ended set of questions to see how they describe the process of solving said problem.<p>This usually involves talking about tools, their process, their libraries of choice(something more generic here for other fields) and generally helps to assess their personable skills.<p>If I like them, I will ask them if they have any personal projects they want to share or something they are enthusiastic about in their domain of knowledge.<p>I think the biggest thing is that a lot of companies doing technical interviewing only reserve a small period of time to determine their new candidate. For people long in the industry, their resume should speak for itself. For younger people, it&#x27;s kind of like, would you sleep with a woman you just met? How does that experience usually turn out? It&#x27;s a 50/50 or worse chance you end up with a nightmare. Spend some time to interview your candidates, or end up with the one-night-stand.",1371977098

The original Economic Times article points that a large number of engineers are struggling to get placed but fails to give any satisfying evidence.\n2. The article also only takes in account the candidates that got placed through college placement, it entirely disregards the engineers who may have gotten job through other means or those who may have started a business of their own.\n3. Compare the hiring data that is shown for two universities - For IIT it is fairly consistent, For Amity, as the article mentions the placements are currently underway in the institute so it is not final data.\n4. It says that India&#x27;s IT industry will be hiring fewer people this year however it doesn&#x27;t take into account other Indian industries which saw a boom in hiring this year - such as the Indian auto industry. In fact the article is mainly or as I suspect solely based on the IT industry data.<p>To conclude I think the Economic Times article only convinces me of one thing - rate of increase in engineers in India is proportional  to it&#x27;s population growth rate which I should think is the natural course of things.",1371976251

Possible final destinations are either Iceland and Ecuador, according to previous media reports.</i><p>I first thought that Ecuador would be more likely, since had Iceland been his final destination, he probably would have taken the Icelandic businessman&#x27;s offer to hire him a chartered flight. But then I realized that perhaps Snowden places more trust in a commercial flight and not being detained in Moscow than a stranger&#x27;s chartered flight which could potentially backstab him and hand him over to US authorities.",1371974891

The issues arose when it later became clear that there may not have been as much of a market for slot as originally envisioned. The C-17 handles vehicles easier than the A400M (where there&#x27;s lower than expected weight restrictions on what can be carried) while not providing the savings expected for palatalized cargo that the newest models of the C-130(J) can handle. So it&#x27;s being pressed from both sides.<p>Of course, the C-17 had teething problems in the beginning. But it benefited from a better environment at the time.<p>In any case, big item procurement is an utter mess these days. The money is drying up fast after the end of the cold-war, and the inefficient and wasteful structure that thrived during that time can no longer do so. So we get massively overpriced and delayed equipment.",1371974694

So it&#x27;s not the Hillier and Lieberman textbook approach to Operations Research of old. The whole point was to make the difficult problem of combinatorial problem solving fun and attractive to a wide audience.<p>I agree with you that many managers haven&#x27;t a clue what to do with an OR graduate. So it does depend on how you position yourself. One reason for taking the course is to be able to promote your skills passionately (try making a video of your skills in every day parlance like the introductory video to this lecture) using current terminology - which as Prof Van Hentenryck says are in demand at INFORMS conferences (go to the analytics conference - rather than the main conference which is more academic).<p>I agree with you that many execs haven&#x27;t a clue what optimization can do - or care - in fact most managers satisfice. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to find the right boss who does value your accomplishments. It&#x27;s also important to update how you state your value to others - which is one reason I&#x27;m doing the course.\nI hope you stick with it - and I&#x27;d be interested to know what you think at the end of it.<p>Is the point of your argument that the leaderboard ranking forces people to try for an optimal solution, when in a business situation a solution at 99% of the value might be good enough?",1371974414

But are you talking about how the generated HTML is just output, and contains both page structure and page data?<p>Also with this release of MVC, the Restful data controllers are added on the side. Designing this from scratch, it would probably be different – if your client wants JSON, XML or some other format, then the Data endpoint is for you. If you want text/html, then it's special and you go somewhere else.<p>We can already serve JSON or XML data off controller endpoints in MVC3, and using a bit of extra code, even switch between them by checking the Accept header. But never mind, it's not done until it's in the framework.<p>If you really are past using MVC views entirely, and have just  pages without server-side markup (except perhaps feeding in data URL) + a rest API  then you are an outlier and can consider other fameworks beside MVC, such as OpenRasta. Or Ruby.<p>MVC is not an opinionated framework – you can do things any number of ways. If it supports Data API + static HTML websites, which it looks like, that will not be the only thing that it supports.",1330169843

Too much interpretation can interfere with the process of pattern recognition that is essential for doing mathematics well. You also see this in programming whenever someone writes<p><pre><code>    public interface List<T> { ... }\n</code></pre>\nin Java, or when you write<p><pre><code>    Tree a = Empty | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)\n</code></pre>\nin Haskell. It <i>doesn't matter</i> what 'T' and 'a' are, so we use short, one-character representations for them. The fact that you can write Bayes rule  as <i>P(A|B) = P(A)P(B|A)/P(B)</i> (where I've even used a zero-character representation for the background information!) expresses the fact that <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> can be arbitrary events, and don't need to have any connection to hypotheses, models or data.

They don't get that there are 10 other investors who also want a little more information, and that the process of talking to them all can bring a startup to a standstill for months.<p>I wish there was a way to know the 90% of information that an investor might ask you ahead of time, and be ready by having those questions answered.",1218242964

I would think less of you if you chose to use $OSChoiceTwo anyway, just to be popular. Which i think is the real problem here: Choosing something due to its perception and thinking it will make you work better instead of finding something that actually makes you work better.<p>And just to note, not every Mac costs $2000. Just like not every PC sells for < $1000.  The Macbook costs $1100 (even less if you're a student or have an ADC discount) and an Alienware laptop from Dell costs $2100.",1218242616

You can't just use something else if you want to collaborate with people who use it.<p>I'm not very happy about having to use git, but the pain numbs after a while.

But if you don't, you can let the numbers speak for you.""<p>PG you have hundreds of people applying to make a deal with you (through YC) and once you agree to make a deal--a decision that takes you 20 minutes--you are rarely rejected. Plus, when you are rejected the people who reject you usually fail. I appreciate the modesty but by no means do you seem like a poor deal maker.<p>I feel that no matter one's starting point they should work on there deal making ability so they can have more then just the numbers. You need the steak and the sizzle.<p>Just as startup founders in order to make a good product need to be persistent, intelligent and understand the technology; in order to make good deals the founders still need to be persistent and intelligent but also need to understand the components of what it takes to find and close deals.<p>So how can startup founders learn to be good deal makers?",1218242067

The nice thing is that B is a subset of A -- under A, I could put some of my rights (the right to sell my life, the right to harm myself, the right to agree not to take a job in the future) under the control of a legal entity that prevented me from exercising it.

It is rare to see windows users sneer at other people, just b/c of their choice of OS.<p>Remember, not everybody has 2K to spend in a computer, and if you are a student and do, your priorities are kind of backwards.<p>You can save a 1k by bying a decent PC, so you have 1k of savings, and one month more of runtime to work on a basement for your idea or startup to flourish.   And I Bet you money, that all you need to spend is about 1 DAY in tinckering around, until you make both Windows and Linux as usable as your Mac.  If you can survive with 1k a month (I could in Cambridge), you just saved about 29 days to work on your startup, if you had to buy the pricey macbook pro.<p>And, I have Macos, Windows XP, and a Linux box at home, and i can say that while MacOs is the more polished and better looking than all, it is not necessary the fastes for me.  I find myself working much faster in XP or Linux.<p>And all of those that say you have to spend lots of money $$ into a good laptop in order to be able to get working,  well, if you can't code in a $1,000 laptop,  you probably can't in a $2,000 one.",1218241646
271202,story,,,12,18,un,"Creating a marketplace for artificial intelligence",,"The applications being created on the web today aren't as sophisticated as they could be, the reason being that to create something large enough to offer as a complete product requires tremendous resources. For example speech recognition is produced by only by two giant companies (Microsoft and IBM), and some level of text analysis in search engines (google, yahoo, microsoft). Computer vision is being actively pursued at large companies and yet they still cannot release a product yet.<p>An  alternative way would be for small companies/individuals to start producing small fragments of functionality and offering it in a per for use basis. (as in a cat recognizer in an image, or a recognizer for the word ""hello"" in an audiofile).<p>To create the above recognizer would require gathering data (such as hundreds/thousands of pictures of cats) and feeding it to a supervised learning algorithm like svm, boosting etc.<p>Thousands (perhaps millions) of people creating their own ""classifiers"" and charging for them (perhaps 1000 uses for 1 dollar) over the web might lead rapidly to seeing/thinking machines.<p>(A similar model can also be used to pose competition to entrenched monopoly software like mathematica/maya/autocad - thousands of people creating and charging for small bits of functionality)",1218241642

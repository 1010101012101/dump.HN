8338904,comment,8338750,8338750,6,0,agentultra,,,"My experience has varied wildly with person to person (<i>disclaimer: I am self taught</i>).<p>In my limited experience there exists a spectrum of programmers in the self-taught category. On the extreme left you have people whose sole experience with programming is just getting the damn computer to do what they want with as little effort as possible: copy and paste some code that seems like it fixes the problem, run it, and tweak as necessary. On the far right you have people who fell into programming as kids and took to it like a moth to a flame. Without any prompting they taught themselves assemblers for the various CPU architectures they came across, learned about cellular automata and dove into artificial chemistry, and could debate the finer points between normal and applicative orders. They&#x27;ve probably toyed with developing their own language using operational semantics or devoured texts on geometry and linear algebra at the breakfast table. Most of us, fortunately, sit somewhere in the middle.<p>I don&#x27;t relish having to look for work as I am now. In my experience it comes down to a handful of scenarios:<p>1. You&#x27;re sitting across the table from someone who is at least 10 years younger than you and has landed a senior role fresh out of school. AFAIK they&#x27;ll self-select towards people their own age that look like them... and have similar life-experiences. You might not want to lead with your self-taught badge and down-play it if you can. Don&#x27;t hide it though: you never know who you may come across and if you have the experience to back you up you can be a very strong contender.<p>2. HR drone at Big Co. is staring at your resume to figure out who you are. You&#x27;re candidate X out of 5 they have to interview today and 28 they will sift through this week. They&#x27;re also simultaneous scanning for keywords and will likely ask you where your education experience is located on your CV. You can&#x27;t do anything but be candid. Hopefully you can knock the socks off of the developers in the next few rounds of interviews and exploit the poor communication channels between HR and staff. Unless the bureaucracy rules the roost: then you&#x27;re just not in the right place.<p>3. You come recommended by someone you know who works at the company you&#x27;re applying to. You just have to get through the interview. Play up your self-taughtness. It&#x27;s really an advantage.<p>My rule of thumb is to wear my badge on my chest. I just have to ace the technical interview (which is the hardest part for me... my typing speed shrinks to nothing under pressure from a smooth 56-60wpm). What&#x27;s the worst that could happen?",1411098444

8338901,comment,8335010,8335010,3,0,DEADB17,,,"I think that contrasting OOP with FP brings too many implicit assumptions to the discussion.\nThe value of immutability, for example, seems to be orthogonal to the technique used to structure a computation and is more closely related to the problem to be solved.<p>In my opinion OO languages popularized the idea of having separate internal and external representations by providing language constructs that made it practical. But they also promoted the coupling of data with the methods to manipulate it -- this is not a necessary characteristic of OO but it is common in popular implementations. This association of data and methods turned out to be a limiting factor in the face of changing (maybe unknown) requirements. The flexibility of more dynamic run-times that allow to mutate this relationship during execution (monkey patching) was not a satisfactory solution as it inhibits static analysis. In my experience this is generally the main motivation when looking into alternatives.<p>Modeling computations as dynamic data threaded through a series of statically defined transformation seems like a sensible solution to the issue. It also brings additional benefits (e.g.: easier unit testing) and makes some constructs unnecessary (e.g.: implementation inheritance). This approach is commonly used in FP languages and I think is the main reason why they are contrasted as alternatives.<p>Since it&#x27;s not always possible or desirable to re-write a project, sometimes the technique is dismissed because it is confused with the languages that favor it. The relative lack of resources explaining how to use FP techniques in OO languages doesn&#x27;t help either.<p>Separating the techniques from the implementations has practical value and it allows evolving existing bodies of work.",1411098401

To me that&#x27;s a sign of a company that doesn&#x27;t see a way to grow new products via creative efforts of it&#x27;s employees.  Oh well, I guess it&#x27;s good news for the startups who could much better use the that same talent.\n(Edit - to remove what might have sounded like a recruiting pitch)",1411095812

It powered the industrial revolution and more importantly today, it can keep servers running when wind and Oskar can&#x27;t (unless you only want to serve pages when the wind blows and the sun shines). Besides being dependable, it us also affordable and with today&#x27;s technology emits very little pollution.",1411095782

(It&#x27;s a long story...the CS degree came after the self-teaching, for the most part.)  If I were the hiring manager, someone who&#x27;s self-taught would be a mild bonus: it shows initiative and passion.  Other people think differently - some won&#x27;t hire any without a degree, some would rather not hire someone without a degree, many don&#x27;t care.  You can to some extent choose who you work with and what they value by how you position yourself.",1411095770

For an entry level job, I&#x27;ll probably still lean towards the self-taught candidate. But, mid or upper range? I don&#x27;t think it is relevant anymore at that stage in their career. I place more value on someone who actually has a passion for the field over one where it&#x27;s simply a means to pay the mortgage.",1411095613

Zuckerberg said he planned to give away 99% of his wealth to help other people. That&#x27;s a good thing. Why criticize him now? If he ends up not doing it, criticize him then. If all he was doing was trying to avoid some estate taxes, he could have done that without any announcement at all, certainly drawing less scrutiny.<p>Scrutiny is important here, because the IRS could disallow the application of the LLC estate planning loophole here just by saying so.

Biases - upbringing, environment, experiences and so on tend to influence a person&#x27;s preferences and beliefs, and they may be expressing what it is their social group expects or how they view themselves.<p>3.

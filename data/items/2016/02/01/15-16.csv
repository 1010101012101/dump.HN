Our long term goal is to give every site the same performance, security, and reliability that major sites like Google and Facebook accomplish, without any specialized network hardware or complicated administration. We enhance millions of sites, including this one. We&#x27;re hiring for a variety of roles -- started 2015 at 128, ended around 220, doubling again in 2016. This is a perfect time to join -- product market fit is established, but there&#x27;s a lot of great engineering, product, sales, and support work to be done. We&#x27;ve publicly said we&#x27;re profitable and on track for long term independent success.<p>You may wish to check out our blog to see the kinds of engineering work we do.

We have a range of customers, from consumers with a single blog all the way through some of the largest sites on the Internet, and designing interfaces which work well for all of these users is a big challenge -- are you up to it?<p>2) Great front-end engineers -- building new UI/UX to expose controls and data to customers is an increasing portion of what we do. Our current front-end stack is Backbone + Marionette with Browserify and Sass. Our new projects are using React + Redux + Babel + css-modules, and generally adopting Higher Order Components. We&#x27;re also starting the process of re-imagining our main WWW Front-end stack with a migration to Redux.<p>3) Systems Engineer -- looking for people to help serve even more traffic, build infrastructure for security and robustness, and contribute back to open source projects. We make extensive use of nginx, lua/luajit, and ssl-at-scale.<p>4) &quot;Prototyping engineers&quot; -- people who want to prototype things in go (backend) through js frontend.

Over the last 3 years I&#x27;ve gradually shifted from development to managing projects and product development, and recently moved to the team leader/manager.<p>Right now I really like the product and management side of the work, but the technical / programmer side I am very burned out on.  I used to spend my free time consulting, coding, researching, and had dreams of starting my own company.  Now I want to go home and relax, work with my hands out in the yard/garden.<p>I&#x27;ve been at the same company for 7 years now, we typically have enough freedom and project variation to learn new skills and keep from being bored. There are simply to many frameworks/languages to keep up with to stay relevant.  I don&#x27;t see myself finding another development job after this one, at least not without time off/a break.  The money is great, and I&#x27;ve been fortunate to save well, and we live will below our means.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m working on a plan to be out of the industry by the time my daughter graduates high school and I&#x27;m 45.",1454342388

For instance, I used to work at a place where all carriers claimed to have good coverage, while in practice, everyone at the office had AT&T: The reason? The building was built in such a way that nobody really had good coverage. What AT&T did was install repeaters INSIDE THE BUILDING, to get a decent connection, and with that, they got easily 2000 subscribers.<p>Similar things can happen with cable too: A lot of people in my hometown rave about Charter&#x27;s speeds, but in my subdivision, nobody uses them: There is packet loss, outages... so the entire neighborhood ends up with UVerse, which, while far slower and more expensive, it actually works.",1454342376

11012469,comment,11009109,11009109,0,0,golergka,,,"I have been toying with one fantastic idea lately. I know why it would seem like a pure fantasy, and I&#x27;m not pretending that it&#x27;s anything more at the moment, but give it some benefit of a doubt.<p>It&#x27;s quite simple. Imagine, just for a second, that current trillion evaluations for all the unicorns will turn out to be true in some point in the future. How can it be? What will be going on in this fantastic world? There&#x27;s only one possible explanation: internet ate everything.<p>The dotcom boom hanged on a very simple, explicit assumption: that internet commerce is viable. That people actually will spend money on the internet. Of course, it lead to a bubble, and that bubble burst, but the assumption itself turned out to be correct. More than that: the valuation that NASDAQ have given to the whole internet industry in the late 90s is a reality know. Of course, individual 90s startups weren&#x27;t worth that money, but internet industry as a whole certainly is. Even if you judge it just by turnover, without even looking at prospects of growth.<p>So, the first step of internet revolution that was promised by dotcoms already happened. But what about the next step? No one is really talking about it, because it&#x27;s too fantastic to believe in and nobody wants to be laughed at. But we know what it can theoretically be: the current wave of SV unicorns will _eat_ their respective industries.<p>Imagine it. 90% of taxi industry is Ubers, Lyfts, Getts. 90% of book industry is Amazon. (Wait, that almost already happened). 90% of TV is Netflix and stuff. 90% of payments are Square and Paypal. 90% of hotel industry is AirBnB, Booking.com and something else. Walmart have gone after Blockbuster, everybody orders groceries with online drone delivery. Giant malls stand abandoned, everybody&#x27;s ordering from AliBaba. And so on.<p>Of course it sounds a little stupid; I drastically simplify it, so we can talk about it without spending time arguing about inconsequential details. And don&#x27;t forget, all this is more like a fantasy right now.<p>But the point is, in this fantastic world such initiatives by Google, just as free basics by Facebook have nothing to do with charity. Remember, how in the 90s, the only companies that really made money of internet were telecom companies, because the only sure way to monetize an internet user was to charge him for access? (Oh, and porn of course). In contrast, in this fantasy world, the cost of internet access will become insignificant compared to all the money you can get from a person with internet access. And in this fantasy world internet corporations will gladly provide you the access for free. May be they will still charge you a couple of cents for 100Mbps to 1Gbps upgrade, but the 0 (zero) bps to 1Mbps upgrade will make so much money to them that you have no chances of paying for it.",1454342269

Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We&#x27;re building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges for our web devs range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, React, and CoffeeScript today, but you&#x27;d be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>Our bioengineers apply math to hard biological problems, ranging from liquid handling optimization to reasoning about how &quot;identical&quot; reagents diverge over time to interfere with reproducibility.

I don&#x27;t find this comparison warranted.<p>That couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.<p>How many people know Google using location data from Android phones to track which physical stores users visit?<p>They were even mining paid Google Apps for Business accounts for tracking data.<p>From <a href=""http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/03/13/26google.h33.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2014/03/13/26google.h33.ht...</a><p>Highlights:<p>&quot;As part of a potentially explosive lawsuit making its way through federal court, the giant online-services provider Google has acknowledged scanning the contents of millions of email messages sent and received by student users of the company’s Apps for Education tool suite for schools. In the suit, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company also faces accusations from plaintiffs that it went further, crossing a “creepy line” by using information gleaned from the scans to build “surreptitious” profiles of Apps for Education users that could be used for such purposes as targeted advertising.&quot;<p>&quot;A Google spokeswoman confirmed to Education Week that the company “scans and indexes” the emails of all Apps for Education users for a variety of purposes, including potential advertising, via automated processes that cannot be turned off—even for Apps for Education customers who elect not to receive ads. The company would not say whether those email scans are used to help build profiles of students or other Apps for Education users, but said the results of its data mining are not used to actually target ads to Apps for Education users unless they choose to receive them.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Student-data-privacy experts contend that the latter claim is contradicted by Google’s own court filings in the California suit. They describe the case as highly troubling and likely to further inflame rising national concern that protection of children’s private educational information is too lax.&quot;<p>&quot;Mr. Thiele said his district has used Google Apps for Education since 2008. Officials there have always been aware that the company does “back-end processing” of students’ email messages, he said, but the district’s agreement with Google precludes such data from being used to serve ads to students or staff members. As long as the company abides by those terms, Mr. Thiele said, “I don’t have any problem with it.” In an emailed statement provided to Education Week, Bram Bout, the director of Google Apps for Education, said that “ads in Gmail are turned off by default for Google Apps for Education and we have no plans to change that in the future.”&quot;\n...\n&quot;Those plaintiffs in the California lawsuit allege that Google treats Google Apps for Education email users virtually the same as it treats consumer Gmail users. That means not only mining students’ email messages for key words and other information, but also using resulting data—including newly created derivative information, or “metadata”—for “secret user profiling” that could serve as the basis for such activities as delivering targeted ads in Google products other than Apps for Education, such as Google Search, Google+, and YouTube.&quot;<p>&quot;The plaintiffs allege that Google has employed such practices since around 2010, when it began using a new technology, known as Content Onebox, that allows the company to intercept and scan emails before they reach their intended recipients, rather than after messages are delivered to users’ inboxes, regardless of whether ads are turned off.&quot;<p>&quot;While the allegations by the plaintiffs are explosive, it’s the sworn declarations of Google representatives in response to their claims that have truly raised the eyebrows of observers and privacy experts. Contrary to the company’s earlier public statements, Google representatives acknowledged in a September motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ request for class certification that the company’s consumer-privacy policy applies to Apps for Education users. Thus, Google argues, it has students’ (and other Apps for Education users’) consent to scan and process their emails.&quot;<p>&quot;In November, Kyle C. Wong, a lawyer representing Google, also argued in a formal declaration submitted to the court in opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification that the company’s data-mining practices are widely known, and that the plaintiffs’ complaints that the scanning and processing of their emails was done secretly are thus invalid. Mr. Wong cited extensive media coverage about Google’s data mining of Gmail consumer users’<p>>Mr. Wong’s inclusion of the following reference to the disclosure provided to students at the University of Alaska particularly caught the attention of privacy advocates: The University of Alaska (“UA”) has a “Google Mail FAQs,” which asks, “I hear that Google reads my email. Is this true?” The answer states, “They do not ‘read’ your email per se. For use in targeted advertising on their other sites, if your email is not encrypted, software (not a person) does scan your email and compile keywords for advertising. For example, if the software looks at 100 emails and identifies the word ‘Doritos’ or ‘camping’ 50 times, they will use that data for advertising on their other sites.”\n“The fact that Google put this in their declaration means we take it as true,” said Ms. Barnes of the privacy watchdog group EPIC. Google’s sworn court statements reveal that the company has violated student trust by using students’ education records for profit.”<p>From a Google filing in court about Gmail privacy:<p>>Indeed, “a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties.” Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743-44 (1979).<p>>it&#x27;s &quot;inconceivable&quot; that someone using a Gmail account would not be aware that the information in their email would be known to Google.",1454341720

11012334,comment,11009956,11010368,0,0,nilkn,,,"Why do you think most developers should be paid similarly to a highly specialized doctor?<p>First of all, you might be thinking of doctors like neurosurgeons. Less than 1% of practicing physicians in the US are neurosurgeons, and some neurosurgeons make as little as $250k (often ones with special academic appointments). Not all of them make $1M/year or even $700k/year.<p>Second of all, you might in general be overestimating doctor compensation. See this report:<p><a href=""http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/compensation/2015/public/overview#page=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/compensation/2015...</a><p>Primary care doctors earned an average of $195k in total compensation. Half that is $97.5k. There are many developers who make more than that -- certainly far more than .1% of developers. That is, in fact, the median pay for software developers:<p><a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Computer-and-Information-Technology/Software-developers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Computer-and-Information-Technology/S...</a><p>Granted, you did say specialized doctor, and we see from the MedScape report that they make $280k on average. Half of that is only $140k. There are fresh college graduates who make more than that in total compensation. I&#x27;ve even known relatively new developers making $250k once bonuses and vesting stocks are taken into account. Either way, $140k in total pay is not uncommon at all for an experienced senior developer. Again, certainly far more than .1% of developers are in that income bracket.<p>Finally, and perhaps more importantly, I think you might underestimate the difficulty of becoming a specialized doctor. It&#x27;s certainly much harder than becoming an average programmer. The educational requirements are vastly higher and more rigorous. The debt load is in the six figures for all but children of the rich. And the time investment is at minimum 11 years (4 undergrad + 4 medical school + minimum of 3 residency). But since we&#x27;re talking about specialized MDs, the residency will actually be longer than that, as long as 7 years for a neurosurgeon, plus an extra 2-3 for a fellowship if desired. After all that, the doctor will potentially work twice as much as the programmer.<p>It&#x27;s not fair to compare the average heart surgeon to the average programer, because the heart surgeon is by definition vastly above average among doctors in both education, grades, and pay. It would really only be fair to compare the heart surgeon to, say, a senior engineer at Google (or similar), where a total compensation exceeding $250k is common.<p>As for lawyers, many law school graduates I know don&#x27;t even have a job. The days are long gone where a law degree was automatically a golden ticket. It&#x27;s certainly true that the top lawyers make a large amount of money, but becoming a partner (say) at a large firm is just not comparable to becoming a programmer. These days, it&#x27;s like winning the lottery.",1454341305

We plan to bring on an innovative data scientist - with a minimum of a B.S. in statistics, bioinformatics, engineering, computer science, or relevant field (translating to 4-5 years experience). We want someone with extensive experience performing statistical analysis in R,  Python, or another data analysis language.  The position will entail combining code and data from different disciplines, translating and optimizing published research algorithms into industry products, and creating reference databases that can be used in machine learning applications. Expertise in the analysis of metagenomics data and bioinformatics pipelines is a bonus. We are looking someone who is flexible - a fast learner with relevant experience that will allow them to contribute quickly. You will be a key player in a cutting edge, rapidly growing venture-backed microbiome startup.<p>Phylagen leverages the vast, unseen world of microbes to improve our daily lives. The microbiome - the trillions of interacting bacteria, fungi, algae, protists, archaea and viruses that inhabit every inch of our world - is the most complex, untapped dataset on earth.  We combine advanced DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analytics with scalable, high performance computing to analyze the microbiome in ways previously not possible. This enables us to determine and interpret complex genetic signatures and provide a powerful new decision-making tool for businesses.",1454341232

Rather than have him write one from scratch, find one that includes a lot of the things you want and have him tweak it. It will be cheaper that way.

I worked on tons of high profile video games, and later transitioned to VFX for film, and worked on a ton of popular blockbusters.\nBut the thing is: I love the work, but the management of software development is stone age voodoo and witch hunts, deceptive management, and psychological manipulation. Our career is create on demand on schedule. It&#x27;s a recipe for stress and burnout. And I burned out.  \nI returned to school, got an MBA (2nd in my class) and found that no one would hire me because my technology past was &quot;too exciting&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d never be happy with what they do&quot;. But that is exactly what I wanted! I even tried not including my previous &quot;exciting&quot; past work, but that read as either an unemployment hole or was figured out with a Google search of my name. \nI had to eat, so I returned to developing.

We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo, Berlin and Sydney. More offices are coming soon. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably. Right now we are particularly trying to grow in Labs and Cloud Foundry.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on. Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch.

I say absorbing because there are two sides - too much fructose and not enough fiber.<p>1. First he says Japanese people do add fructose outside of fruit to their diets. Both sides of this generalization don&#x27;t really matter in the face of the actual numbers and shades of grey and as a whole this is a small part of the overall point.<p>2. He talks about factors leading to a more sedentary lifestyle.  Is this really a rebuttal? Is he saying that the enormous rise in obesity is causes by this? If it is a contributing factor, does it take away from the main point? Does a rise of two worker households even mean a more sedentary lifestyle (even for the children)?  It seems like a lot of words used on something that at most could be pointed to to say that the effects of fructose aren&#x27;t quite as extreme, but it seems to me that there is a loose correlation between what he lists, decreases physical activity, and then the health data at core of the argument.<p>3. Then he seems to think that citing a study using 150 grams of sugar (which is the about the equivalent of a pitcher) is not worth looking at because it is too  much. Is it not common to use exaggerated doses in studies to be able to exaggerate effects?  How is anything contradicted by this?<p>Overall I expected a lot more from your description, but that page doesn&#x27;t just lack a smoking gun, it is tiny arguments over points that are almost inconsequential to the main theme.<p>So then that begs the question of what you would attribute to the enormous increase in obesity and what you would peg as the causation of the correlation between increased fructose consumption and obesity.",1454339601

Our customers love us, our investors love us, and we’re looking to hire.\nWe have offices in SF, DC, North Carolina, London, and now Sweden!<p>What we’re looking for (<a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi</a>):<p>Specifically we need:<p>-A Data Engineer (<a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/c2f85048-55da-49c9-9c0c-c46babce40ec?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/c2f85048-55da-49c9-9c0c...</a>)<p>-DevOps - System Admin (<a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/e7f0ede3-647b-4282-bf07-a59d33c839d1?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/e7f0ede3-647b-4282-bf07...</a>)<p>- DevOps - System Engineering (<a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/b4c90b41-7d35-451e-858a-0bedaac184c0?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/b4c90b41-7d35-451e-858a...</a>)<p>-Customer Success Managers (<a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/4d09d09d-d68a-478d-8bbe-dbc679e49ea9?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/4d09d09d-d68a-478d-8bbe...</a>)<p>-Support Engineers (<a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/29f2ad17-fccd-4caa-95ad-f8b2f261573b?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/29f2ad17-fccd-4caa-95ad...</a>)<p>- Front End Engineer (<a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/6e54a1b2-7192-49c3-be82-53e28e730e4f?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/6e54a1b2-7192-49c3-be82...</a>)<p>- Senior Learning and Development Manager (<a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/a3d0b123-ca99-476c-ba4c-de063a9319b2?lever-via=3TYvimYmGi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/distilnetworks/a3d0b123-ca99-476c-ba4c...</a>)<p>We’re also hiring for Marketing, Recruiting, Finance, and Sales!

Things should be done locally first. I don&#x27;t even want to say &quot;offline first&quot; because the idea of a binary online/offline is again a symptom of thinking that one is either &quot;connected to the internet&quot; or not, with the former implying very comfortable access to the internet to get anything done.<p>We should be encouraging things like IPFS. Back in the day, usegroups and other software did things better than the glorified mainframe approach of today.",1454338915

Regardless of age, subsequent times have always felt faster than the first one to me.<p>From this, I entirely unscientifically surmise that the extra time experience comes from the creation of pathways and whatnot in the brain--which occurs less often the older you get. The more specific explanations could be actual spare cycles in the brain that are only used then encountering something new, or more plausibly, the ratio of conscious vs. unconscious cycles or plain stimulation of the regions responsible for time comprehension.",1240325917

572368,comment,572177,572177,0,0,kylec,,,"Being a relatively new community, Stack Overflow has been wrestling with these issues for some time. Most recently, Michael Pryor [1] posted a topic [2] questioning the need for closing questions, which, ironically, has been closed 7 times [3], and generated a lengthy (but otherwise well-mannered) discussion with some people on both sides of the isle and many others in between, culminating in a blog post [4] about what constitutes an acceptable question.<p>Historically, my position has been similar to the unofficial policy here at Hacker News, in that topics/questions should be allowed if they interest/concern hackers/programmers, even though they may not specifically be about hacking/programming. However, recently I've come to see that, if left unchecked, generic discussion questions will overrun Stack Overflow simply because they appeal to the greatest common denominator of the audience, and therefore garner the most attention.<p>The closing system on Stack Overflow works quite well as that limited check. By providing guidelines for acceptable questions and a mechanism for closing those that aren't, Stack Overflow provides the means to keep it's garden (to borrow a metaphor from the article). However, by having the community, as opposed to appointed moderators, keep the garden, it means that fun, insightful, or otherwise constructive yet off-topic questions can remain in a limited capacity, so long as those that want to keep them outnumber those that want to remove them.<p>1: Cofounder of Fog Creek.

A question is closed when it reaches 5 close votes. The one exception is that starred moderators can immediately close or open a question. Once closed, the same mechanism is used to open a question back up.<p>4: <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/the-stack-overflow-question-lifecycle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/the-stack-overflow-que...</a>",1240324560

I think the answer is ""sort of"".<p>The problem with OOP is that it encourages the proliferation of mutable state. If each object has mutable state, then a large object-oriented program has distributed mutable state, potentially in hundreds of different silos. Problems like concurrency become impossible to reason about.<p>FP encourages the careful sequestration of mutable state. It's false to say that FP outlaws it entirely, since it's hard to do anything useful without side effects. However, functional style limits and sequesters mutable state to such a degree that it's usually easy to reason about what side effects are happening.",1240324497

572323,comment,572122,572122,0,0,banned_man,,,"The issue with Wall Street overcompensation has more to do with what has happened to nearly every other profession in the past 3 decades: utter fucking meltdown. Academia: the job market for PhDs is so terrible as to constitute a glaring and likely mortal embarrassment to the profession. Law: big-firm (""biglaw"") attorneys now face a single-digit percent chance of making partnership, but are still expected to work hours that would be reasonable only if eventual partnership were guaranteed. Medicine: doctors' standards of living are being continually eroded by the scumbag bureaucrats who staff the health insurance companies. Manufacturing: in the Midwest, the recession began in 1980 and hasn't stopped yet. Infrastructure: falling apart due to low investment. At the same time, housing costs, medical bills, and tuitions have skyrocketed while commodities like food and gas have been more expensive. Enough numerical gymnastics are employed to make inflation appear low (and, thus, real GDP growth seem high) but if the numbers were accurately reflected, inflation would be closer to 5-7% and real GDP growth would be flat or slightly negative; the entire 2000s decade would appear to be a recession, which is what it has been for most Americans. What changed in 2008, for most Americans, is that the rich fell down too, and quite visibly; thus, people became less embarrassed to talk about it. It's no longer an admission of personal failure to talk about how bad things are.<p>The result is an economy that shows a lack of pluralism: finance dominates, all other professions suffer. Most Americans don't understand the complexities of the situation and liken Wall Street to a cancer responsible for the atrophy of the real economy.<p>I don't want to see finance get destroyed, but a return to a pluralistic economy where people assume roles appropriate to their abilities and behaviors. The perverse irony here is that capital markets are supposed to efficiently allocate resources, yet the era of the market-state has utterly misallocated the nation's talent, strangling academia while directing a disproportionate share of talented people to finance, one of the industries in which they're least useful.",1240322707

You have your first word, your first step, your first day of school, the first time you learn to ride a bike, the whole puberty thing. There is a huge number of changes occurring that you have never experienced before.
Plus you have the anticipation of all that is to come, and when you are focused wanting something to be here, it feels like it takes much longer to arrive.<p>As an adult, I often have days when I become so involved in what I am doing that I lose track of time, poof all of a sudden the day is over.

They were built by developers for developers with minimal thought towards everyday users.  This was the first major shift away from that and it seems to have worked.  It took into account how people used Office and is the result of countless focus groups and studies.  As I said earlier, it takes a while to grok it, but once you do, there really is no going back.<p>My wife is an excellent example of a non-tech user.  I surreptitiously installed Office 2007 on her computer when I upgraded her HD and reinstalled Windows.  She hated it at first because it was different than what she was used to (Office XP).  She hates change as most people do.  But as she used it, she got used to the new UI and now has said she loves it and wishes more of her programs worked that way.<p>I hate to sound like a Microsoft homer, but seriously, the ribbon UI is one of the more innovative and fresh ideas to come out of Redmond lately.",1240322471

(Both players must use the dictionary they agreed upon at the beginning of the game.) Moving the dictionary to the server doesn't make any difference here; it's simply not fair for it to change during the game. (Maybe I wanted to play a word, but it wasn't available. Now that it's your turn, it is suddenly available.)<p>""Since at this point you are stuck, not knowing who caused the disagreement...

We may or may not agree on the requirements if there's a third party who needs to know the outcome of the game. But I think we can agree there is no such third party in Letterpress.

4772282,comment,4771928,4772214,2,0,chrizel,,,"But you have to keep in mind, according to the code (<a href=""https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/backbone.js#L1234"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/backbo...</a> ) this will only get rid of the events on this.model and this.collection. If you are using another field or model (like in your example myModel, if it is not the same as this.model) -- then you will still get memory leaks.<p>Backbone is a real pitfall here in larger projects and you have to keep memory leaks in mind when using Backbone events. (sadly JavaScript has no WeakMaps yet, which would solve the problem for us) That's why projects like Backbone Marionette or EventBinder exists which are handling the Backbone events leaking problem better than bare bones Backbone alone. See <a href=""http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/15/zombies-run-managing-page-transitions-in-backbone-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/15/zombies-run-ma...</a><p>In a very large application I'm writing at the moment I've introduced a common View parent class which extends Backbone views with proper subview handling and correct event disposal. So in my views I can write something like this (works very similar to the Backbone view's DOM ""event"" mapping field, but instead of DOM events we are talking about Backbone events here) [Edit: well, looking at the submission article, that's very similar to the solution described in the article]<p><pre><code>    objectEvents: {
      'model change': 'reload',
      'collection reset': 'render'
    }
</code></pre>
Then my View class handles the rest: it connects the events in the constructor and disconnects them correctly on remove(). The only thing you have to keep in mind is that you have to remove all old subviews explicitly when they get recreated. That's when my subview handling kicks in, because I have some helper methods like addSubView and removeAllSubViews which get called when re-rendering the parent view.<p>Backbone subview handling can be a real pain and memory management has to be kept in mind. Every time you are using the ""on""-method you should ask yourself when this event gets destroyed and if it could lead to a memory leak. Or you should use something like EventBinder. <a href=""https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.eventbinder"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.eventbinder</a>",1352716993

4772263,comment,4771545,4772064,1,0,tolmasky,,,"At this point I just want to make it clear that I don't want to be argumentative, but rather just find out whether you don't understand me or I don't understand you :)<p>Just for clarification, when I talk about servers I am referring to ""my own hand coded server that I run"" -- like what you would need for this kind of game before Game Center existed. I refer to dealing with Game Center as ""serverless"" simply because your code can't run on Game Center, so for the purposes of this discussion its as if both clients are talking directly to eachother since Game Center serves simply as a dumb pipe.<p>1. That being said, a main point of my last post was that its very simple for either party to lie about this initial state (either intentionally or unintentionally as we'll see in a second). Its as simple as changing the dictionary AFTER the game starts (its <i>slightly</i> more complex if the dictionary is being checked EVERY move, but not much more complex). I want to also specifically note again that this could actually easily have happen accidentally:<p>Lets say I updated from the App Store <i>mid game</i>, and now you have all sorts of weird edge cases as we are once again in the situation where one person has more words in their dictionary than the other. If you simply did one check in the beginning, the game is now once again ""unfair"". If you are doing a check every turn, the situation is still not ideal. Does it just drop the game assuming the worst? Or do you instead ""freeze"" the game indefinitely until both parties have updated? Perhaps it continues using the ""old dictionary"" for that ONE game -- requiring potentially storing multiple ""versioned"" dictionaries until they're done being used? Then you have the weird effect that you could have sworn you just successfully used that word in another game you just started but its not working here, huh. None of these is particularly satisfactory or fun to code.<p>So yes, you can always detect a mismatch, but what's interesting is how you then proceed. In other words, determining WHY there is a mismatch. Again, if you are willing to simply terminate abruptly regardless as soon as the game detects a disagreement that's fine, but in my opinion that is not a good user experience (this is what I meant before about preventing cheating vs. detecting cheating). A world where everything goes through a server gatekeeper simply does not have this issue, as there is only ever one dictionary -- the app wouldn't even need to include a dictionary itself. There is simply never a scenario where one client successfully sends bad data to the other client (short of someone hacking your server of course).<p>2. I meant here only that letterpress could today start using Game Center's rankings without providing its own server (the same way Fruit Ninja does for example). Of course I think this is bad for the same reasons I think not going through your own server for each move is bad, I just wanted to point out that since letterpress seems determined to go ""serverless"", and rankings are a feature people have requested, these ""cheating"" issues could be compounded by having rankings, that is all.<p>To sum up my point: With client to client communication there can necessarily always be disagreement (which you seem to agree with). One side can always say ""this is good"" while the other says ""no its not"". Since at this point you are stuck, not knowing <i>who</i> caused the disagreement, the end result is not ""user friendly"" (and again arguably ALLOWING this to happen in the first place is not user friendly -- I think everyone would prefer a world where you simply can't send bad data). To provide a good user experience I think it is better to avoid this possibility completely. With client->server->client communication, the clients will never disagree. The ""thinking"" takes place ONCE on the server, so the message is known to be sane by the time it gets to the opposing client. Whenever there are just two parties talking to eachother you can never know who is telling the truth. Again, in a world where you ""don't care"" about the results that is fine: by that I mean if you are willing to terminate the game and establish ""no result"" the second there are any shenanigans started then I am in complete agreement with you that you need no server. This however doesn't mean no cheating, it just means BAIL on detection of cheating. However, if you want to establish who won (in other words  say ""congrats"" or ""sorry you lose""), whether it be as simple as just showing the correct dialog to both users or more importantly if you ever wish to record it publicly (such as in a ranking system) -- then it is necessary to have an actual resolution, which can only be reliably done if the actions are going through an external gatekeeper:<p>SERVER MODEL: client1 sends word to server -> server checks word -> server sends word to client2 (even if I send bad words maliciously they will never get past the server, at the end of the game the winner can be recorded)
CLIENT MODEL: client1 sends word to client2 (since at any point in the middle I can send a bad word -- whether it be because I'm malicious or because my app got updated or WHATEVER -- the clients can be placed in a conflicting state)",1352716122

The JVM ecosystem came first, has access to a generally superior host platform and libraries, is implemented largely in Java, and contains many required components to bootstrap ClojureScript. ClojureScript is implemented in JVM-Based Clojure, reusing some of those Java components (like the reader), lacking in features that generally make less sense in target environments (ie. eval in browsers), and generally acts as a complementary library for JVM Clojure web apps. Being a Clojure dialect, there is community interest in reusing some of ClojureScript's implementation, meta circularly, for additional platforms including Lua, ChickenScheme, LLVM/ObjC, .NET, and yes, the JVM. If the people working on those projects want to contribute modularity and platform abstraction improvements to ClojureScript's reader, analyzer, code generator, build infrastructure, or libraries, their patches will be actively considered.",1352716108

(The comments here at the moment are all predictably confused.)<p>Start here: <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/520892/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/520892/</a><p>Core parts of Gnome (and probably lots of other Linux-y software, I haven't been following all of it) are all moving to require systemd. Systemd certainly promises a lot of advantages, like better handling of removable devices (and more: <a href=""https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1149530#p1149530"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1149530#p1149530</a>), but it is also replacing the tried-and-trusted rc approach. OpenBSD leaders in particular are concerned about systemd from a security standpoint; it has a lot of code that runs as root, it is big and unwieldy and the documentation is a mess.<p>So, not only were the OpenBSD developers faced with either auditing the entire systemd code base -- and then doing it again every time there's a new release -- or attempting to re-implement it in a compatible way, now they're also staring down the very short barrel of a nasty gun in which some really big stuff is going to stop working if they don't deal with it.<p>It's a real ugly situation, and OpenBSD really doesn't have the resources to spare to deal with this kind of nonsense. I wouldn't be surprised if this mess ends up tying up a couple of their core developers at an upcoming hackathon, where they could instead be working on something more useful than having to replace a huge part of the system that was working just fine up until Linux decided to throw it out. (Obviously there are plenty of people that would argue it wasn't ""working just fine"", either because they have specific knowledge about it or because ""otherwise we wouldn't have needed systemd"". That's not sufficient justification for forcing other developers to waste tremendous amounts of effort to re-work what was already working for them.)<p>Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the switch to systemd. I <i>liked</i> rc scripts. I've cobbled together my own rc daemon scripts from time to time; I'm not sure how that will work with systemd. I'm also seeing lots of ugly and persistent problems in NetworkMangler and whatever they're using for core audio these days; I'm a little gobsmacked that, rather than fixing those problems, some people decided to replace the init system.",1352715565

This is amplified considerably if you pick a BSD-related operating system and for no good reason.<p>The Linux kernel itself is a remarkably stable system as far as ABI/API is concerned (Linus you rock here), but the packages gyrating around it are completely impossibly unstable and unreliable.<p>A fine example of this is trying to get an SSTP client working with NetworkManager recently. The whole NetworkManager VPN thing is an epic pile of hacks with bits of UI and bits of backend sticking out all over the place. If you're using Debian stable for example, there is no chance in hell you can get a working configuration unless you go and fix the numerous broken interfaces all over the place manually and arguing with pkg-config and literally hundreds of dependencies. How the fuck this ever even worked to start with I don't know. There are massive API changes with minor versions of packages all through NetworkManager and Gnome, which is just wrong.<p>The underlying issue is simply shitty engineering from a large body of open source projects who don't care about upstream or doing their job properly. To name and shame: The <i>entire</i> Gnome project, just about anything Ubuntu have chucked out, the <i>entire</i> KDE project post KDE2.<p>It's utterly frustrating.

There seems to be a large detachment from reality here.<p>As an example to back my point up, one of the reasons Windows is so damn popular is that the API is <i>incredibly</i> stable and software written in the mid-90s still works fine on current versions without a recompilation or any API changes.

I got a ride from a native american who smuggled me aboard the ferry he worked on, so I could cross to Prince Edwards Island for free. I got a ride from an older couple and their grandson in a camper, who invited me to stay with them at a campsite (and gave me my first taste of Moosehead lager). And in Newfoundland, apart from plenty of good car rides, interesting conversations, (and being invited for Moose meat dinner, and even overnight stays) I got a 'ride' from one coastal village to the next, from a couple on a tiny boat, that were motoring around Newfoundland.<p>In France and the Netherlands I did some hitch-hiking as well, both for practical reasons (when there was no bus), and for fun. Was a bit harder there, but on overall it was great. Australia was ok too, though it could be a while before one got a ride...<p>What I especially liked about it is the enormous diversity of people that one meets, and the life-stories they can tell. From a factory worker on his way home from the night-shift, metal-heads in a minivan heading for a French rock concert, and people racing across states to visit an ill relative, to doctors on holiday in their BMW, and land-lords making their round in a cabrio sports-car.<p>Thumbs up to hitch-hiking!",1352714650

And yet, a lot of person use VLC to play music, to our own astonishment.<p>Therefore, we are working to make the audio part getting better, and we are working hard on that part (next hackdays topic, in December, is only the audio core).<p>However, except gapless and a correct media library (which we have but is not activated), all the things listed from this article are done in VLC, including resampling, equalizer, loudness, fingerprinting, software amplification... VLC has also a compressor, a parametric equalizer, a spatializer, pitch correction, scaletempo and many downmixers / headphones enhancers. We have also Karaoke support...<p>Moreover, libswresample is far from being the best quality ever.<p>So, why don't we have gapless in VLC? Well, because to get correct gapless (not the 50ms you can have with VLC) or cross-fading, you need to have 2 inputs at the same time.

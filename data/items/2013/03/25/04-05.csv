5435563,comment,5434963,5434963,1,0,dm8,,,"My startup is in digital advertising (includes desktop, phones and tablets) space. And I know digital advertising is hated by users. There are three main reasons, online ads are obnoxious, obtrusive and invade end-user privacy.  Lets step back and understand how come advertising was considered as glamorous and it turned into evil with digital medium.<p>Advertising for years operated on the ""purchase funnel"" concept [1][2]. Top end of the funnel is occupied by big brand advertisers whose goal is to create awareness for the brands/products. If you create enough awareness, end-consumers will eventually buy your products. Generally, brands/companies with millions of dollars in advertising operate at the top end of the funnel due to financial resources they have at their disposal. At the bottom of the funnel there are low end marketers whose sole goal is to find right customers and make immediate sale.<p>Other mediums like TV, Out of the home, Print (big magazines not newspapers) have top of the funnel advertisers pouring millions of dollars. Due to nature of the medium, you don't know who is watching/viewing your ad (targeting is very limited). So they engage in creating awareness and eventually prospective customers.<p>In digital medium, it's easy to track who is going to be end-user so low-end of the marketers came into play where you mostly get banner ads like deals, discount offers to make sale immediately.<p>Unfortunately, digital advertising ecosystem so far has built around low-end marketers as customers. Due to this advertising on digital sucks. Banners are terrible way to advertising for big brands who are not particularly interested in immediate sale. Result- we haven't seen big brands doing huge campaigns in digital arena. The share of digital advertising in overall advertising pie is very small.<p>To cater, low-end marketers we have crazy level of targeting and people feel violated when it comes to privacy.<p>Innovation (to address aforementioned problems) is happening in digital advertising, albeit at much slower pace. We are seeing new ways of advertising. Video is attracting bigger brands who are interested in creating awareness. There are some other interesting solutions popping up (we are building one, sorry for shameless plug) where by catering to different set of customers with different objectives we don't have to build user behaviors by doing crazy data mining. I'm optimistic, as big brands and top end of the funnel advertisers come into the play, we won't need crazy targeting and invasion of our privacy. Don't forget digital advertising in current state is utterly broken and everyone inside industry knows, we will definitely see much better solutions in next couple of years.<p>References:\n[1] Purchase Funnel - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_funnel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_funnel</a>\n[2] Understanding the funnel: <a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/understanding_t.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/understandin...</a>",1364187370

5435555,comment,5429824,5433692,1,0,purplelobster,,,"Agreed, Finland is a very homogeneous country, but you just have to look across the Baltic to find a very similar country with similar immigration levels to the US (Sweden), which I happen to be from. Now the difference is what kind of immigrants the US gets versus European countries. The US has a much higher ratio of skilled immigrant workers. It's very difficult to get in to this country without a STEM master's degree, I'd know. Almost nobody moves to Sweden for the reason to work. They move to Sweden because they might be killed in their home country if they don't leave, and it's one of the few countries that can't turn away immigrants who face threats to their lives. Now look at Portland, which I also happen to live in. It might have a lot of immigrants, but come ON! Are you really using Portland as an example of a dysfunctional place? Portland? Personally, I think this is one of the best places in this country. If I'd go by the correlation then I'd say more diverse populations result in better communities, but I wouldn't go that far.<p>I'll admit that diverse populations do create problems, but I think it's a cop out for people to blame that for any little problem you might be facing. Man up and take some responsibility.<p>And this is the point where people start using size as an argument, and how states within the country differ sooo much. I've had long discussions with several people saying that New York and Texas are as different as France and Germany. Which is just ludicrous and shows how little they know about the world.<p>Btw, Russians and Finns are not closely related in any sense. If you said that to a Finn they'd probably kill you, just giving a heads up. Swedes and Finns are more intertwined by history and culture than related in the genetic or language sense. If you told a Finn that they're related to Swedes they might kill you slightly for that too.",1364187112

5435551,comment,5434669,5435523,3,0,tiredofcareer,,,"Let's start with a base assertion: Human beings are wired and programmed to reproduce.<p>Yes? Everybody agree? Assuming I didn't lose anybody there.<p>Onward: tricky business about sex, particularly from men (who I think are programmed in a much more culturally-unfriendly way when it comes to sex; multiple partners, ogling, and so forth), is unfortunately going to happen. Kind of like farting. It's noble that most of us can keep it under control in the workplace. Guarantee that even the quietest, most reserved, shy, never-an-HR-issue male employee, even ones who openly fight for feminist causes here, has occasionally looked at cleavage and thought, ""boy, those are great tits."" Equally so if the man is gay, just the opposite gender that produces that reaction. It happens. Everybody does it. Women do it too. <i>You are programmed to admire the reproductive and aesthetic traits of the gender(s) that arouse(s) you. You shouldn't be ashamed of it.</i><p>Nothing so far has been controversial, I hope. I might have lost a certain group at the end of the last paragraph. Let me finish quickly while they start typing:<p>It's unreasonable to expect both men and women, biologically, to completely suppress sex in any form whatsoever. That culture expects us to is, I think, a bug in culture(+). There is something broken here on both sides of the gender divide, and I don't know that we understand as a culture how to fix it. Through some horrible perfect storm of social issues among the average programmer, I think we just see this problem amplified to the moon and back. I've been to construction sites. Visit one sometime. Talk to the workers.<p>I feel like for countless years culture has been at war with humanity. We shame sex across the board, we shame farting and burping, we shame natural odors, we shame hair in certain places for certain genders, we shame vulgarity, we shame picking our noses... the list goes on and on and on. Where's the culture that understands its members are human beings with flaws?<p>Maybe, just maybe, I feel like political correctness and attempting to 'fix' human beings has done more harm than good. Maybe we're acting appropriately and reacting inappropriately. Fair point?<p><i>(+) The source of this bug is a patch committed by a religious working group, and that patch should be reverted, but that's an argument for another time.</i>",1364186980

But let me rephrase that  why should you consider my hypothetical complaint, as a heterosexual male, that my coincidentally female significant other doesn't ""get"" my interests in technology to be one of those cuts in the first place?<p>Before I was a programmer I worked in K-12 education, where females rather than males comprise the dominant population, so I think I have the experience to comment on this. There was some actual sexism that I faced there, as a male charged with watching over students. But for all of that, I never allowed myself to feel discomfort about the fact that most of my coworkers were female. Nor that when they complained about their significant others during our lunch breaks, those SOs happened to be overwhelmingly male. It was just something I had to get over.<p>> The intent of my blog posts (there's a few in the series) was to share my personal experiences and feelings. Not to explicitly label them as sexism or say everyone must share those feelings or say ""hey you, you better go fix this"" or any other number of things you seem to be attributing to it.<p>I grant that I may have missed the purpose of your posts (I will read them from the beginning), but when you call these things ""paper cuts"" it is implied that these are wrongs that have been done unto you, whether or not they fall into the subcategory of sexism. If they are indeed wrongs, then they need to be addressed so that other people do not suffer them as well.

And we DO do this to some extent - why else does almost every tech startup founder read Steve Blank's book?<p>In skydiving, you can make mistakes because of the gear and emergency procedures you're working with - and you learn from each of them.

Germany and France have argued that, Cyprus's offshore-haven business model wasnt sustainable with, Bank of France Governor, Christian Noyer saying that ""Cypriot banks have for years been taking the kinds of risks that are not allowed in France""[1]<p>The reason why Cyprus are getting a deal like this is because of the accusations of Money Laundering - an accusation which has led to Cyprus opening an investigation into[2] which is mainly due to the fact that, a Russian accountant (Sergei Magnitsky) was killed in jail in 2009 after revealing that $31 million of the tax money was moved out of Russia using five Cypriot banks: Alpha Bank, Cyprus Popular Bank, FBME Bank, Privatbank International and Komercbanka[2] and because, Cyprus are still heavily exposed to Greece. In fact, the exposure of domestic [Cypriot] banks to Greece amounted to 28 billion, or one-third of total assets and 170% of GDP. Of the 28 billion, government bonds amounted to 4.7 billion; the rest were loans to Greek residents[3]<p>The initial plans were to apply a levy on all accounts in Cyprus (up to 10% although, this was then rumoured to be 25% on everyones savings above 100k Euros) which was rejected. Then there was a suggestion to nationalize semi-state pension funds although, Germany amongst others were against this idea suggesting that this could be even more painful for ordinary Cypriots than a deposit levy.<p>The plan now appears to be involving nationalizing state pensions and split failing lenders into good and bad banks which is highlighted by the article, with Laiki (Cypruss number 2 bank becoming a bad bank).<p>Its an interesting scenario from an economical standpoint although, Cyprus should have received a bailout as part of the Greek bailout due to their significant exposure to the Greek economy, regardless if they are an offshore-haven or not.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/449633/20130324/cyprus-seeks-11th-hour-deal-to-avert-financial-collapse.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/449633/20130324/cyprus-see...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://euobserver.com/magnitsky/118524"" rel=""nofollow"">http://euobserver.com/magnitsky/118524</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.iif.com/emr/resources+2662.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iif.com/emr/resources+2662.php</a>",1364184518

Even in the good old days, it was very easy to get left behind in the biglaw game if you didn't score a position or clerkship right out of school.<p>Another factor is the partnership structure. In the 50 US States, only lawyers can have an ownership stake in a law firm. Partners are often practicing, so there is some motivation to keep the hourly rates high for their own benefit.<p>* DC is an outlier, mostly to enable our 'wonderful' lobbying system.",1364184349

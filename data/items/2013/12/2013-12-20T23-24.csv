6944913,comment,6944059,6944809,16,0,strlen,,,"As someone from former USSR, here&#x27;s my take: the reason Khodorkovsky went to jail is because he violated the law of thieves, he stood up to Putin&#x27;s bullying. If there was an across-the-board principled anti-corruption effort it would be a different matter, but there wasn&#x27;t. I am tired of hearing Western&#x27;s justify Putin&#x27;s thuggery.<p>I personally come from Belarus, where a president that was democratically elected on anti-corruption charges assumed the role of a dictator. This was well expected by most of the intelligentsia: on the day of the run off election where Lukashenko&#x27;s win (against another shitbird, of course, who ended up siding with Lukashenko afterwards) was confirmed my brother called us and told us to lookup &#x27;Sulla&#x27; (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla</a>) in a history book. The practice of using &quot;crusade against corruption&quot; to assume dictatorial role is as old as democracy itself.<p>That said Putin is far more pernicious than Lukashenko: with Lukashenko there is no longer any more of a pretense of democracy than there was under, e.g., Saddam in Iraq (there are elections with mythical sounding figures and no campaigns). Putin is far more cunning: he&#x27;s able to maintain the facade of democracy while having unchecked and unelected power. With recent revelations about &quot;enhanced interrogations&quot;, NSA and FISA kangaroo courts, US -- while light years far from turning into a Russia or Belarus -- is starting to show some of these very same dangerous signs of police state(1) tactics via plausible deniability.<p>I&#x27;ll leave this quote out there on the topic of rule by robber barrons (which the oligarchs were plain and simple) vs. rule by thugs on a moral crusade:<p>&quot;Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&#x27;s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.&quot;<p>- C.S. Lewis<p>(1) Here I am using the historical definition of police state: while today it&#x27;s equated with totalitarianism (and neither Russia nor Belarus -- much less United States even under the worse scenario -- are totalitarian states, as anyone living in those countries who has also lived under Soviet rule can attest), the original  meaning contrasted a &#x27;polizeistaat&#x27; (rule by decree without any constitutional limitations) with a &#x27;rechtstaat&#x27; (rights state -- constitutionally limited rule of law).<p>As a side note, it is unfortunate that the privatization process was botched enormously in USSR and its successor states. I always thought that the right approach to privatization should have been to follow the old Leninist slogan _literally_: factories to workers, farms to peasants, i.e., give the employees non-trivial amounts of shares/options in their workplace. Instead it became &quot;factories and farms to corrupt middle managers and old Soviet elite&quot;.",1387583050

Correlation is, and causation is inferred from patterns of correlation.<p>When done scientifically, the specific method to go from observed correlation to conclusions about causation is to form a hypothesis, predict future observations based on that hypothesis that could be falsified to disprove it, and then go and test those predictions.<p>Eventually, doing this enough, and you&#x27;ll end up with falsifiable models that have been rigorously tested from which you can make inferences about what must have caused events where you cannot observe the correlated event that you would infer to be the cause that are as strong as the inferences of causation you can make with events where you observe both the putative cause and the effect for which you infer it is the cause.<p>> If you haven&#x27;t observed the cause, you have no rational reason to establish 100% confidence about what it was.<p>If you <i>have</i> observed the supposed cause -- and its supposed effect -- you have no rational reason to assert a causal link with <i>actual</i> 100% certainty.

Now, apparently, I interpreted your previous post incorrectly as to how you go about distinguishing better evidence from worse evidence, but my main point that I was trying to make still stands: Your distinction is somewhat arbitrary and I have the strong impression that you aren&#x27;t really aware of it.<p>For example, you are constantly referring to the here-and-now as some kind of special category of evidence. You do realize that there isn&#x27;t really any &quot;here and now&quot;? There is no &quot;sun here now&quot; - there is only a brain here and now that processes signals that we hypothesize come from photo receptors in the eyes, which we further hypothesize were stimulated by waves of electromagnetic radiation, which in turn we hypothesize has previously been traveling for around eight minutes from what we hypothesize to be a star, about which we further hypothesize how it works internally, which is part of why we hypothesize that it is still creating those electromagnetic waves, even though we wouldn&#x27;t know for another eight minutes if it had disappeared (or so we hypothesize). That&#x27;s a whole lot of hypotheses and indirect evidence and quite a bit of looking into the past involved to call that &quot;present knowledge from the here and now&quot;, don&#x27;t you think?<p>And no, we can not observe the cause - you only can observe the effects, ever. In the case of the sun, that is the electromagnetic radiation that we hypothesize to be created by a star in our neighbourhood.<p>And essentially the same thing is true for the big bang: We see its effects, among those the microwave background, which is electromagnetic radiation which we hypothesize to be coming from the horizon of when the universe became transparent, which we hypothesize to be 13.7 billion light-years away, ... - and if you have a radio telescope, it can easily be confirmed by the senses daily.<p>So, if you were to apply your standards consistently, you probably would have to consider belief in the existence of the sun right now or belief in the existence of bacteria and viruses (you can not observe those with your senses, in case you mean that a little bit too literally) as a matter of faith.<p>I would think that that&#x27;s silly, and it&#x27;s much saner to say that the empirical evidence for the sun and the big bang and bacteria is all pretty strong, possibly varying a bit in strength, but without any of the qualitative differences that you seem to be implying.",1387581657

The demand for PAKE authentication in TLS is not strong.</i><p>I&#x27;d argue that there&#x27;s no demand for TLS-SRP because most of the people who could make use of it don&#x27;t even know it exists.  (Conventional thinking is that the only way to do authentication in TLS is with X.509.  TLS-PSK has the same problem.)<p>But applications can&#x27;t reasonably support TLS things that the TLS libraries they use don&#x27;t support.  Two of the three elephants in the TLS room, SChannel and NSS, don&#x27;t support TLS-SRP.  The other elephant, OpenSSL, has supported it for less than two years.<p>There&#x27;s interest in (and patches for) adding TLS-SRP support to NSS, but they don&#x27;t seem to want to implement anything that Firefox won&#x27;t use:<p><a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=356855#c25\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=356855#c25</a><p>(As an aside, I think NSS&#x27;s position on supporting TLS-SRP highlights the biggest problem with chaining your code to a library produced by another entity for their own use: unless you have the ability to fork and maintain it yourself, your future use of that library is at the mercy of the other entity&#x27;s interests.  Fedora is porting all of their TLS-using packages to Mozilla&#x27;s NSS, a project that exists for other Mozilla products&#x27; benefit.  node.js is joined at the head to Google&#x27;s V8, a JavaScript engine that exists for Chrome&#x27;s benefit.  My crystal ball shows both situations ending very badly when these projects&#x27; needs and directions get far enough out of alignment.)",1387581387

Your view point is hardly forbidden.<p>Of course it would be bad if people cheered their kids into transitioning when they aren&#x27;t actually trans - but I doubt this really happens, even in the most liberal and open minded San Francisco neighborhoods. Medical professionals constantly try and second guess trans people to make sure they are serious - and this is even more intense when the patient is underage.<p>Secondly, taking cross-gender hormones is itself an excellent diagnostic test to see if someone is a transsexual. If the patient feels better, then it&#x27;s a strong sign they will benefit from transition. If they feel worse then it&#x27;s indicative that they are not trans. The effects of both estrogen and testosterone are fairly minor for the first few months and readily reversible. Doctors are starting to become more willing to give patients a &quot;trial&quot; on hormones without absurd levels of gatekeeping like in decades past.<p>It&#x27;s not like some poor, confused boy is going to put on his sister&#x27;s panties one day and <i>bam</i> the parents call up their doctor and instantly transform the boy into a trans girl.

Where have you been living, under a rock?<p>Computer programmers are one of the most dismal professionals on that planet. How many so called programmers/coders can even write a simple parser or a compiler? Less than one percent I suspect. I should know because I am one of them.\nAfter dabbling away with Aho and Ullman somewhere in the 80s or 90s I haven&#x27;t approached the subject since.<p>Ever since Smalltalk came out it has been downhill all the way, and it is only now a lot of the current IDEs have caught up with it and in the last few years have begun to extend the concept.<p>I believe that:<p>1. Learning to understand and write parsers and interpreters should be one of the first things taught in computer science even before the whole gamut of data structures and algorithms have been studied.<p>2. Being able to develop IDEs should part of every computer science course. They may even be developed to help illustrate the data structures and algorithms mentioned above.\nUnlike most professions computer scientists are the ones most capable of building the tools for creating, analyzing and illustrating their work, so why are they the ones that as far as we can tell use the shittiest tools available to most professions? Honestly I blame Sun and IBM for this. The moment Java came out everything went down hill. Then the web came, then &#x27;scripting&#x27; , then everybody decided that they could and should &#x27;build&#x27; everything using Notepad, VIM or Textmate.<p>3. The tools are there, Smalltalk guys have been using and developing their own tools for ages, only the targetted graphical environments have been split up and the OS owners, Microsoft in particular keeps blowing hot and cold as to which one system developers should target. IDE and graphical tools development is so interactive that the idea of using traditional compiled languages to develop them is simply absurd unless you use very fast compilers and computers. It is time they went 3D as well may be using some Blender, Unity3D or some other gaming toolkit to bring them up to date. 2D text and graphics are boring.<p>4. The bottom line is IDEs should be something developers ought to create or collaborate to create themselves. The big corporations should stay out of that, ie the decisions shouldn&#x27;t be commercial decisions. It seems that a sad immaturity of computer programming as a profession has led to development tools being dictated by clueless profit seeking corporate bosses. They should be the decisions of developers guilds which should not be linked with corporate interests of any kind. You know what you want, just do it yourselves.<p>5. What else? Yeah, get your parsing skills together,  and don&#x27;t develop it in Javascript unless you plan to develop your own version of Typescript or Dart later on when subtle bugs begin to creep into your cherished IDE.<p>PS.

There&#x27;s plenty of code transformers which are independent of editor or IDE.<p>But it&#x27;s easy to understand why JetBrains, or anyone else would chose not to implement their code transformers as individual programs - it&#x27;s because plain-text sucks - there&#x27;s a non-trivial step needed to go from plain-text to something we can reason about and manipulate. And it&#x27;s also to inefficient to do generally - the smarter tools require incremental parsers.<p>However, try to convince a crowd of programmers that they should stop storing code in plain-text, and instead store it as structural data. They will give you a funny look and then defend the use of plain-text at all costs.<p>I compare it to vomiting data onto the disk versus using a relational database. The former would require you to rebuild a structured format in memory for querying data for each application, each time it runs, then to deconstruct it again to store any modifications (can you imagine how slow sqlite would be if it done this, for example). This is what we do with code. We&#x27;ve learned to cope with grep, manual editing and ad-hoc commands built into editors.<p>I find it madness that if I want to &quot;find a function named X&quot;, I first need to construct a lexer, a parser, a symbol table, then query the table for &#x27;X&#x27; of the type function? Why should code be any less queryable than the rest of our data?<p>You&#x27;d probably find that most of these code transformations/refactoring commands could be built as one-liners in a query language once the code has been stored in a normalized format (which is what these tools are constructing in memory anyway).

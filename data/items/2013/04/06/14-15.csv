You can also snip out profanity of course (or leave it in for flavor; that's up to you).<p>Email: michael.o.church at gmail<p>[Start here]<p>In my opinion, <i>the</i> economic problem of the 21st-century is <i>convexity</i>. Go here for further reading: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/gervais-macleod-21-why-does-work-suck/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/gervais-macle...</a> . I have a whole slew of posts on economic topics that I've put together over the past 2 months. The effect of convexity is a movement from low-risk commodity work to risk-intrinsic work (i.e. its value is purely in its natural uncertainty, and not discomfort as with commodity labor) that is more fun and creative, but harder to make a living from. The overarching theme of economics from 1975 to now has been the offloading of commodity work to machines, who can do it more reliably. The hard and somewhat creative stuff, like programming these machines, is what's left for humans. (Actually, there's a lot of concave grunt work in coding; the goal is to have it done by programs called <i>compilers</i> that, again, can do that concave/boring stuff way better than we.) So the only thing left for humans is the risk-intrinsic convex stuff. I've been studying Convexity for years and it is a big f_king social problem. Convex work has high expectancy but <i>lots</i> of risk and it can't put forward the mediocre, regular income that average people are used to (and could not stand to be without).<p>Software is the leading edge of convex economics. It's the first battlefield between the old industrial regime (everyone gets a mediocre wage for mediocre work) and Convexity. With convexity, you have a long learning period before your earning period (in which, ideally, you keep learning). During that (poorly paid or unpaid, often) learning period, you build a lot of cool stuff. Eventually, you get to a level of expertise and product-quality that people will pay for it; but it's impossible to know (until you engage directly with the market) how close you are to that point. So you end up building lots of still-quite-cool (if not professional-grade) stuff in which there's no harm in giving it away for free. As programmers, we don't really fear people ""stealing our ideas""; ideas are cheap and easy; code is hard. That's part of why we pretty much unanimously hate software patents.<p>Convexity creates risk for workers (because it makes full employment uncommon if not untenable) but also for institutions that need to hire people. Talent discovery is a massive problem. (I'm writing on that right now.) Companies have to pay about $10,000 to hire a 1.2-level (scale here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a> ) programmer (interview time/opportunity cost) and about $40,000 to hire a 1.5 (add recruiting fees, hiring bonuses, perks and more interviewing). How much does it cost to hire a 2.2+? (Sometimes you need that level of talent.) Almost <i>a million</i> (mostly in R&D budgets to build an autonomy culture.) The only places where 2.2+ programmers want to work are companies with extremely high levels of autonomy where they can do 2.<i>3</i>+ level R&D work; no managerial meddling, full autonomy over time, plenty of resources. (The 2.2+ ""repay"" that $500-700k by doing excellent work, of course.) The reason Valve has an open allocation culture and Google used to have one (before ~2009) is that, even if it's ""expensive"" to hire engineers and have them doing R&D with full autonomy, that's what you have to do if you want to hire the (rare and picky) 2.2+.<p>So talent discovery is a hard problem, and there's a bilateral matching problem wherein companies find it really hard to hire the people they want, and even good engineers have significant job latency. The bilateral matching problem only gets <i>worse</i> as you move up the skill curve. (I'm a 1.8 and have had 3-month job searches; then again, I'm really picky.)<p>The old way for undiscovered (usu. young) talent to gate-crash this discovery problem was to pay 50 thousand goddamn dollars per year to some institution already sitting on billions, for 4 years, and then get discovered by another billionaire corporation, climb its organizational ladder doing low-paid boring work, and eventually show (around age 35) that you're ready to do real work (after 10+ mind-numbing years of order-taking that killed your creativity). Well, that's just too inefficient to hold water (get it? convexity, holding water? bad joke. anyway...) anymore.<p>Traditionally, convex labor with extreme talent-discovery problems (such as Hollywood acting and scientific research, where the natural talent us rare) fell to gatekeepers (literary agents, Ivy League admissions officers, graduate departments, athletic recruiters) who were imperfect and sometimes corrupt, but did the job. The problem with software is that no one is qualified to serve this ""middleman"" role because only an equal or superior engineer can judge another software engineer's work. So, it's not just that it's desirable to get around these middling agents; it's that the only people who can really do the job are software engineers, who'd rather write code.<p>So the new way to fix the talent-discovery problem seems to be to create this giant, amazing gift economy that we call ""open source"" (and blogging, print-and-play games, also are part of this). You participate because (a) it's more fun to build cool stuff and give it away than to spend 75+ percent of your time selling and <25 creating, and (b) it's a great way to overcome the talent-discovery problem.<p>So that's why we give cool stuff away for free.",1365259893

Cryptographers have published a very large volume of research on how to create provably secure digital cash.<p>""Right, the person/group who published what may be the most significant usage case of applied cryptography in human history is probably not educated in cryptography""<p>So you think that someone who made no mention of any of the widely studied notions of security, any of the previous work in multiparty computation, any of the previous work in digital cash, or even the fact that allowing polynomial time attackers is a significant weakness in the design was well-educated in cryptography?<p>""Have you even read the whitepaper?""<p>The Bitcoin whitepaper reads like the work of someone who took an undergrad course in cryptography and spent a summer thinking about decentralized payments.  Where is the notion of security even clearly defined -- what does it even mean to prevent double spending?  What does it mean to control ""more CPU power"" than an attacker?<p>Compare the Bitcoin paper to this (just a random result from Google):<p><a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/148.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/148.pdf</a><p>Look at how security is defined in Section 3.2; that is typical of cryptography research in this day and age.  Those are definitions that can be reasoned about in a rigorous way, without hand waving, without poorly defined  concepts like ""CPU power,"" and without having to analyze any specific attack strategy (i.e. the attacker is a ""black box"").  Where in the Bitcoin whitepaper do you see that sort of analysis, or even a hint that such an analysis is possible, desirable, or commonly used?<p>The security analysis presented in the Bitcoin whitepaper assumes a specific attack strategy:  the attacker will try to compute a longer block chain than the rest of the network.  Ignoring for the moment that this can be done in polynomial time, what reason is there to believe that no other attack strategy is possible?  Maybe the attacker can adaptively send malicious messages to particular nodes in the network to break the security of the system.  In multiparty computation, security analysis is usually based on the ""simulation paradigm"" -- a model of security based on showing that no polynomial time attack has a higher probability of success in the real protocol as it would in a simulation of the real protocol where a trusted party does all the work (which rules out all polynomial time attacks).  That is a widely accepted notion of security, and the cryptographers who first published it recently won a Turing award; while other models may be valid, one would have expected an experienced cryptographer to have at least <i>mentioned</i> that they were using a different model (and perhaps justify their approach).<p>The whitepaper also includes statements that suggest a profound lack of knowledge of the decades of previous work in the field of digital cash.  There are claims that no system with a central authority can possibly allow irreversible transactions, but that is untrue -- cryptographers discovered systems that support offline payments, in a model where the bank takes some action when double spending is detected (and in some systems, the bank can produce a proof that double spending occurred and that it was performed by a specific party, allowing for a trustworthy blacklist).  Privacy is mentioned, and again the author makes claims about systems with central authorities that are simply not true -- Chaum's original work on digital cash was <i>motivated</i> by the need for private electronic payments, and that was the first problem to be solved in this field.<p>""When I say ""Bitcoin is secure"", that's by my standard""<p>What is <i>your</i> standard, and why should anyone else accept it?",1365259508

It runs OpenWrt, DD-WRT, and Tomato variants really well, does 802.11n (only one frequency) and has plenty of memory and flash storage for extra hacking. The ASUS RT-N66U is frequently advised if you want 5GHz 802.11n as well.<p>The other router mentioned in this article, the Linksys EA2700, doesn't seem compatible with third party firmware. And apparently the Cisco firmware is buggy, no surprise there. It is an awfully cheap Dual-Band 802.11n router, but if you can't put working software on it it's useless.<p>I don't understand why some major router manufacturer doesn't just sell routers pre-installed with Tomato. It's easy to use, stable, and works way better than any crap the router companies cobble together. Flashing new firmware on a stock ASUS router is too complex for ordinary consumers.",1365257697

First, this assertion is itself pretty nebulous.

From everything that has been presented, it can be reasonably assumed that they simply made a mistake with these charges, and that no malicious intent was involved.<p>It's unfortunate that Facebook made an error that cost someone money, but this article is clearly perverting the story and making undefended, specious assertions to provoke outrage or drive pageviews.",1365257509

Look at how Mir has spurred Wayland to get its act in gear - or how Gnome tried fixing Gnome 3 when Unity happened, or clang vs gcc, or how Go + Rust / Ruby + Python / Java + C# are competitive in the language space, or how Backbone competes with Angular.<p>All over the open source space, there are almost always two opposing forces in each camp, sometimes more, but whenever the competition dries up (VLC?) innovation slows down. VLC has become <i>extremely</i> refined as a media player, and I ask nothing more from it, but it hasn't tried any real radical UI departures or UX shifts and its mobile version is still slow on the uptake.

This meant companies could afford to give away WiFi for free because it cost them little or nothing to install the WiFi initially.<p>But what happened next is what turned the Linksys WRT54G from a ""great"" to a ""legendary"" product - people found out it ran on Linux. Now Linux is open source but more specifically it is under the GPL license.<p>What that meant is that legally Linksys were required to share the source code that made the WRT54G run. Which after some not-so-gentle prodding and legal threats they did.<p>People then made distro's (in the Linux sense) which updated the Linksys firmware to add new functionality, fix issues, and similar. This made the thing even more powerful than perhaps even Linksys wanted, and ate into Cisco's small-medium business space even more.<p>Word spread like wildfire and soon everyone and their brother owned a Linksys WRT54G. Linksys improved the base firmware only mildly while the third party firmware was steamrolling ahead.<p>Cisco eventually purchased Linksys and started cutting corners on all of their retail products. Using less powerful CPUs, less RAM, and stripping out functionality while not altering the cost. Linksys stagnated.<p>This was likely in no small part to try and get some of their small-medium customers back onto Cisco's books, but by then it was too late. The market that Linksys had created had spread to Linksys's competitors and soon everyone was ""letting"" their routers get firmware updates that turned a cheap little home router into something able to fend off medium-business level commercial equipment.",1365256865

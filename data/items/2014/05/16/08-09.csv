But this culture of fear that drives people to nearly always take the safest path is not one that will lead people to happiness. My best friend took the opposite route as me. He drugged out for several years and recently joined the navy. Now he has learned some cool skills that can transfer to other jobs and, more importantly, he&#x27;s gotten a huge build in self confidence. But with his personality he would have been miserable just taking some safe job somewhere and settling down. He needed to find something that inspired him and only then did he really turn his life around.",1400230655

We always strive to understand users and better their experience (in this instance from the very first second they come in touch with Pinterest).<p>The overhaul of the unauth home page, which is internally dubbed &quot;inspired wall&quot;, is a concept that we introduced and refined over a period of a few months. As the name suggests the idea behind it is to instantly connect with you on the level of a story(or a use case) of Pinterest that can inspire you and stick with you as you go through the signup and orientation process. It is a hint of what Pinterest could be for you not written in words but rather expressed through a visual composition. The further you get into the product the more we tailor the experience around things that you love and the story that they tell about you.<p>We actually did quite extensive testing around this experience because it is such an essential and sensitive part of the product. This included concept research (where we tried to identify what got people to use Pinterest), A/B testing (where we quantitatively showed that results were better than the previous home page), and user testing (where we qualitatively showed that people get better understanding and satisfaction with the product). One of the key findings was that people were able to instantly grasp how Pinterest is different from other popular services such as Instagram or Flickr. To put in music channel terms - it did a good job at explaining how MTV is different than VH1.<p>Obviously the work is not done and things can be improved. The inspired wall is still a relatively fresh concept and we continue iterating over it.<p>We plan on releasing an engineering blog post soon that will detail the process of rebuilding our unauth home page and the several iterations that it went through to be successful. Stay tuned and again thanks for the feedback.<p>Ludo",1400230381

Only one of them went to college right out of high school (more went later on when they could afford to pay for it) and the others joined the military to get a start in the world. All of my siblings -- minus the one under lifetime treatment for depression -- are successful today. They all have fulfilling careers and healthy families. None of them had it easy.<p>My parents (begrudgingly) paid for (most of) my college. There was quite of bit of resentment in my family as I had grown up assuming that I would go to college and someone would pay for it, a fairly common belief at the time, at least among my peers. After changing majors a couple of times my parents told me I was on my own. I was angry at first and then I started a small business with some friends, worked hard and finished.<p>After college I moved to another country and worked hard to get a career-path job. After that I worked hard starting my own company in that field. Apart from the degree my parents helped pay for I did it all on my own steam. Those decisions I made -- finishing school, moving to another country, quitting a job to start a company -- those were the ones that defined my life and paved the way for the things that I enjoy today. (I&#x27;m not suggesting I&#x27;ve <i>arrived</i> anywhere, just that I&#x27;ve acquired the tools to live a fulfilling life.)<p>Whenever I meet young people (and by young I mean just out of college) I&#x27;m sometimes very impressed though I&#x27;m often shocked at how much they expect from the world. The impressive ones seem to get it and are working hard either on their own businesses or taking the most aggressive route through graduate school somewhere interesting -- doing what it takes to carve out a niche. The ones that don&#x27;t impress me think that getting a degree (or even not getting one) means they&#x27;re going to have a comfortable life, free of hardship.<p>It&#x27;s not just young people though. I see a lot of people my age who cynically pick up a paycheck every month in a field they&#x27;re not passionate about, that they&#x27;re not truly invested in. Then they completely fall apart because they &quot;got downsized&quot; and they go frantic on FB looking for a lifeline. These are the same people at different stages in life.

Assuming no devaluation of the pound (the incident that caused Britain to leave the ERM), the pound would have become part of the Euro at a ruinously high exchange rate relative to the Deutschmark.  In the financial collapse of 2008, Britain would not have been able to lower interest rates or run quantitative easing.  This is basically the predicament that Spain, Italy and Greece are in (though Greece has other problems).  They have been forced to carry out &quot;internal devaluation&quot; by cutting spending and wages, and due to the sticky prices effect this basically means making very large numbers of people unemployed.<p>Of course, you could argue another counter-factual, that Britain within the Euro would have tipped the balance of power in the ECB in favour of a much more doveish monetary policy from 2008, and thus saved Europe from calamity.

If you have technical skills then the manager assumes that you will leave when something else comes along and so won&#x27;t hire you. So you lie about it and say you&#x27;re a hard worker etc. Later, you go to your first IT interview and they ask about previous jobs. Depending in the interviewer they will be glad that you&#x27;ve had a physical job or they will assume that you&#x27;re not really all that skilled and be cautious in hiring you.

From purely economical point of view the recent arrival of labor from Eastern Europe was a positive, it added 0.25 percentage points to UK&#x27;s growth (according to research done by Treasury). That&#x27;s no surprise, since the immigrants are coming in for jobs (often for the low skilled jobs, since they don&#x27;t know language enough to start a career in their field), so don&#x27;t demand rents, education and healthcare right off.\nNon-European immigrations affected jobs market negatively, yet only in two years of recent recession, in 2009 and 2010.\nThere are, of course, other, non-economical aspects, and here it&#x27;s not so rosy.\nThis article touches the issue from many points of view:\n<a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10822956/EU-elections-2014-Is-immigration-good-for-Britain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/10822956...</a><p>Then, there&#x27;s Germany.

However, they too had a period of high youth unemployment rates. So that isn&#x27;t it either. However, in exactly that period they introduced Nationaler Pakt für. Ausbildung und Fachkräftenachwuchs (Vocational and Educational Training Pact) - a solution that allows young people to simultaneously work and study.

The teacher explained that the middle of the pyramid, the middle class, acted as a cushion between the rich and the poor, taking care of the social stress.<p>The second pyramid had a big middle section, this was the pyramid that represents 1st world countries. One where the bottom is very thin and arrows show that there is a possibility to go from low to middle class, and from middle to the top of the social pyramid. Our teacher explained that this was the classic, democratic capitalist society, and that on countries such as Europeans one, socialists, the pyramid was very similar but a little more flat, meaning that here is a big middle section, middle class, and small high and low class. There is little difference between the three of them.\nThe third pyramid showed the communist society. Where arrows from the low and middle class tried to reach the top but they bounced off the line. A small high society and one big low society, cushioned by a minimal middle class section of pyramid. <i>Then we turned the page and saw the darned fourth pyramid. This one had arrows from the middle class dropping to the low, poor class</i>.\n“What is this?” Some of us asked.<p>The teacher looked at us. “This is us” “It’s the collapsed country, a country that turns into 3rd world country like in pyramid five where there is almost no middle class to speak, one huge low, poor class , and a very small, very rich, top class.” “What are those arrows that go from the middle to the bottom of the pyramid?” Someone asked. You could hear a pin drop. “That is middle class turning into poor”.<p>I won’t lie, no one cried, though people rubbed their faces, held their heads and their breath. No one cried, but we all knew at that very moment that all we thought, all we took for granted, simply was not going to happen. “You see, the income from the middle class is not enough to function as middle class any more. Some from the top class fall to middle class, but the vast majority of the middle class turns into poor” Said the teacher.<p>I don’t know how many people in that room suddenly understood that he/she was poor. The teacher continued “You see, we have a middle class that suddenly turns to poor, creating a society of basically poor people, there is no more middle class to cushion tensions any more. Middle class suddenly discovers that they are overqualified for the jobs they can find and have to settle for anything they can obtain, therefore unemployment sky rockets: too much to offer, too little demand. You see they prepare, study for a job they are not going to get. You kids, you are studying Architecture because you simply wish to do so. Only 3 or 4 percent of you will actually find a job related to architecture.”<p>We all sat there, letting it all sink in. After a few months, it all proved to be true. Even the amount of students that dropped out of college increased to at least 50%. They either so no point in studying something that would not make much of a difference in their future salaries, had no money to keep themselves in college, or simply had to drop college to work and support their families.<p>(Edit: spelling)",1400228574

They can agree that the publisher will sell that content only through their channel. What does it have to do with requiring DRM? Same thing can happen with a DRM free release.</i><p>No it can&#x27;t, what are you smoking? Are you going to put up money to buy territorial rights for content which the publisher is going to give away DRM-free? Of course not, there&#x27;s a high risk that you&#x27;d never recoup your investment. Territorial markets matter a lot, because those block sales represent the production&#x27;s best hope of breaking even. All those markets are different, which is why distributors exist in the first place; they know their local markets better than any individual studio or producer can, and they have the cash flow to write a check based on the budget and the quality of the cast attached to the project.<p>This is how most commercial movies get financed: a large chunk of the budget is ponied up in advance by the international distributors. In turn, they have some control over the release window (which varies by country for all but the most giant projects, because every country is different with different holiday weekends etc. which are more important to consumers than all but the very biggest movie releases), and they impose touch contractual requirements on the studios. This is a completely different market from Netflix. When Netflix licenses something, they (in most cases) already know how it performed and can negotiate the cost of the license based on that date. International distributors are taking much larger financial risks at a much earlier stage of the business cycle. They&#x27;re like VCs, not simple retailers.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be rude, but you&#x27;re making these breezy and uninformed statements about a ~$35 billion industry that&#x27;s been running for over a century and is one of the most competitive and meritocratic sectors of the economy.

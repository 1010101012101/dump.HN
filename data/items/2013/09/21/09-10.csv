But, the &#x27;right design&#x27; is the one that strikes a chord with the majority of your users, making them &#x27;feel at home&#x27;.<p>There are a lot of examples I&#x27;d like to cite, but, the best example you can use for reference is most of Apple&#x27;s web design philosophy (P.S - I&#x27;m NOT an Apple &#x27;fanboy&#x27; though I like their designs). Another one would be Stripe. They have some pretty consistent designs!<p>As a bonus - Every designer has his/her own version of &#x27;good design rules&#x27;. These are just mine :)<p>-Don&#x27;t use complexity where it&#x27;s not needed. Borders and gradients add complexity. (good example: iOS 7)<p>-Generally, try to use contrasting colors for action buttons (Purchase/Sign up/Subscribe). There is some psychological study associated with the color choice too.<p>Link: <a href=""http://blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/color-purchases-lrg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/color...</a><p>-Once you use a color for a particular type of button (Action, or example) maintain it throughout the site - So your users will know which buttons are important and have side effects (like, costing them money) and which ones don&#x27;t.<p>-Contrast is everything. If you use a dark headline, then use a light background. And vice versa. Also, a small black box of 100px x 100px provides more contrast than a mild grey box of 200px x 200px. Contrast is not something that is proportional with colors. Always experiment!<p>- Sometimes, you get drowned in your own designs that you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell them if they are actually good looking or you only feel that way because you bought it/designed it yourself.<p>-In such situations, close all tabs, watch a movie or perhaps even go for a small cycling session and come back and re-check. You&#x27;d be surprised how many flaws you will be able to discover, then :)<p>I&#x27;m only telling you all this since you specifically mentioned you are a non-designer.

Your Given and When manipulate the environment <i>and</i> store state in the test. Your then doesn&#x27;t check the environment at all, it checks it&#x27;s own internal state. I think in your example this is less of an issue than the cases I&#x27;ve worked with before (usually testing remote running apps).<p>> And yes, time-dependent code is evil. I should probably add commentary to my style-guide to explicitly call that out, but thankfully we never ran into that despite testing of distributed-job-queue functionality, by virtue of having a queue so simple stubbing its main loop to work in-process in a deterministic way was trivial.<p>Yes, as I say I wasn&#x27;t claiming that was what you were doing, but it&#x27;s the only other way I&#x27;ve seen the same kind of tests written. Before the first reply, I didn&#x27;t know which it would be. I&#x27;m very glad it wasn&#x27;t :)<p>> If my style guide isn&#x27;t clear on that point -- that a When should NEVER follow a Then -- I need to clarify that. :)<p>My example was contrived, but I think you can probably see the point I&#x27;m making. What the test does is not clear without understanding the ruby underneath, and by storing state you can have tests which don&#x27;t do what you expect because they aren&#x27;t just querying the state of your application.<p>I&#x27;m aware I&#x27;ve been quite ranty about this, it&#x27;s mostly I&#x27;ve had to deal with <i>bad</i> tests written in this style. <i>Good</i> tests written in this style seem fine generally. I think this is more of an issue with cucumber than the tests themselves.<p>> I recall a Gherkin-based testing framework that handled the actual step definitions MUCH differently and much more cleanly but I never got around to fully switching us over and don&#x27;t recall the name... :-S<p>I might have a look around.

They search <i>mathematical representations</i> of your fingerprints.<p>To uniquely identify your fingerprint an image is scanned for unique features called &quot;minutia points&quot;[1]. The spacing and orientation of those points is what is stored and later searched for.<p>Fingerprint matching isn&#x27;t boolean. When you do a database search you get a list of high probability matches. There are no perfect matches, even between two different images of the exact same finger. Everything is based on probability. For law enforcement purposes, strong matches result in a technician reviewing actual images and making comparisons. For biometric security like this (which is not my area) I expect that there is a threshold percentage match that must be met.<p>The reason this quote concerns me is that while the actual image can&#x27;t be reproduced, the image isn&#x27;t the part that matters!

This may sound cliche, but I woke up a year and a half ago and realised I had so many things I wanted to do but just never did.  So I wrote a bucket list of activities, things to learn, places to travel to / general life goals and through going out and doing these I am so much more happy.  In the last year Ive taken up Spanish, learnt to surf, sailed the whitsundays, camped on Fraser Island, visited a Damien Hirst exhibition, partied in Ibiza, in the next few months I'm going to my first festival, to the European Football Championships, a number of Olympics events and La Tomatina festival in Bunol, added to that I've just planned my next trip to Central & S.America for 3 months in September.<p>I suppose the moral of my point is not to be fixated on attaining a net worth, enjoy each day for what it is and get out and do the things you want to do.  In a few years do you want to sit back and look at your bank balance or think back to the life you've led.

Perl's Moose object system, on the other hand, has easy support for composition via roles and delegation via ... well, delegation :)<p>And, you have ""extends""-style OO available if you think it's the right solution to a particular problem.

I assure you that no computer hardware works by looking at stored state with a lens and using computer vision algorithms to determine the state of the device.</i><p>Oh sorry. It's a somewhat strange concept I admit, but it's served me well. There are a couple of ways to motivate it. Let us say that a computer has 4G of memory (roughly 10^10 bits). That is a vast amount of data. If that were to be printed out into a sheet of paper, with each bit a dot about what the naked human eye can see (call it .1 mm square) then it would be a sheet about 10 square meters (10^5 * 10^-4m = 10m^2).<p>The actual size of a 4G RAM chip is more like 1mm^2. This is a reduction factor of 10,000.<p>Let us say that a physical screen operates at the density of our original printout . This implies that the software sitting between the display and main memory is essentially functioning as a microscope, making visible to the naked eye a sheet of paper that is 10,000x smaller than we can see.<p>But if we consider <i>information</i> rather than data, the magnification is an order-of-magnitude higher, at least. (A screenful of characters 10px on each side requires 100bits, whereas the codepoint takes around 8bits.) And of course if we consider hard-drives rather than main memory, realize that a TB is roughly 1000x main memory, or 1000 sheets of paper, each 10 meters square (about 310 square meters).",1333573616

8063193,comment,8060699,8061387,5,0,klibertp,,,"> I suspect the authors main problem with Clojure<p>That&#x27;s not a very nice thing to do, suspecting people without any kind of evidence. Not to mention the fact that there is a `set!` form in Clojure, which makes it entirely possible to write very imperative code (and thread-local semantics don&#x27;t matter in single-threaded programs).<p>Anyway, &quot;problems with Clojure&quot; can be very different for different people. I like Clojure design as a language - even its interop with OO host features are very neat - but then when I want to hack some simple script in a REPL I not only need to write this:<p><pre><code>    $ rlwrap java -cp &quot;clojure-1.5.1.jar&quot; clojure.main\n</code></pre>\nbut then I need to wait for freaking 6 seconds for the prompt to appear. 6 seconds. I don&#x27;t know what more I could write here, so I&#x27;ll just paste this (Chicken Scheme):<p><pre><code>    $ time csi -e &#x27;(exit)&#x27;\n    csi -e &#x27;(exit)&#x27;  0,01s user 0,00s system 81% cpu 0,007 total\n</code></pre>\nSo that&#x27;s my problem with Clojure, nothing to do with &quot;functional way&quot;, right?",1405940218

The actual experiment itself was simple, but the hard bit was creating several-meter long hollow glass syringes in order to inject die into the flow tube well into its flow, in order to avoid turbulence where the header emptied into it... ended up dangling borax glass tubes off the roof with a 1kg weight lashed onto the end, and then blasting the centre with a blowtorch - serious fun.<p>Anyway, long story short, it&#x27;s a really interesting experiment to run, Reynolds number (for water, at least) can be deduced by a teenager with about £100 of equipment, and the boundary between laminar and turbulent flow is a mysterious beast indeed.<p>One interesting artefact was inducing turbulent flow in speeds &quot;too slow&quot; for turbulence, by increasing flow to the point where turbulence triggered, then decreasing flow to the laminar realm again, yet retaining the turbulence indefinitely. Interestingly, this low-speed turbulent domain required a smaller throttle on the header tank to maintain the same flow rate - i.e. the turbulence decreases resistance to flow in the tube.

Our safety is partly dependent on the absence of major power vs. major power popularly supported animosity. A modern version of total war would not look like the WWII version of total war, or even the Cold War hypothetical WW3 version of total war.<p>Instead it looks like economic war, trade war, sabotage, cyber war, espionage, and guerrilla warfare/terrorism.<p>Want to hear a funny joke?<p>&quot;How many lasers does it take to stop a nuclear bomb being exploded in a shipping container in the port of a major population center?&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Give up?

How vulnerable is our critical power, fuel, manufacturing, transportation, water, and emergency medical care infrastructure to sabotage? Here the punchline is: we&#x27;re fucked.<p>You can&#x27;t use laser weapons to conquer the 21st century Earth, at best you can use them as part of a deterrent. The moment you become a hegemonic asshole then you end up being a major target for asymmetrical warfare. Look at what happened with Russia vs. a teeny, tiny group of folks in Chechnya/Dagestan. Not only were tens of thousands of Russian troops killed in brutal urban warfare but hundreds of Russian civilians were killed by terrorist attacks within Russia proper. Chechnya has a population one one thousandth of China. Imagine turning China into a new Chechnya by attempting to conquer it with violence. Anti-ballistic missile lasers don&#x27;t help with car bombs, they don&#x27;t help with assassinations, or kidnappings, or sabotage.<p>Moreover, there is too much mutual self-interest against a major military confrontation between any of the major economies of the world for anything of the sort to be likely. The major conflicts of the 21st century are, as now, likely to be of a much different nature.",1405938101

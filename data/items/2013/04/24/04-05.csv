5599905,comment,5599606,5599606,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> I went back to Postgres - and spent hours doing configuration of users, tables, schema, and security, not writing code for my application. I deleted Postgres from my system. Why do SQL databases have massive layers of configuration and security on them - seems a relic of the past - why not let the application take care of all that.<p>""SQL databases"" don't. Standalone multiuser, nondedicated database servers (many of which happen to be SQL-based RDBMSs) do, because they are designed to support direct user access (through general purpose client applications) and multiple applications -- both of which need to authenticate against the database -- from the same database server. So the application <i>can't</i> reasonably handle security and configuration. There are SQL databases that have less security and configuration, because they are embedded databases rather than database servers (SQLite is a particularly well-known example.)",1366779404

In order to subvert them, we need to outmaneuver them, not refuse to play.  In this light, iTunes is an excellent example of a DRM success story: fewer people with power over music content care to insist on music DRM.<p>Providers of content in other domains (e.g. books) will stop insisting on DRM when we demonstrate to them that systems without it are fundamentally more profitable in their domain than systems with it.  I think this is doable, but not if we refuse to demonstrate it.  They'll simply force people to switch platforms.",1366779275

(I mean, sure, most good businesspeople can and probably should learn a little bit of programming... just like most programmers should learn a little business.  But for most of us?   we can only be really good at one or the other.)<p>Most of us?  we're lopsided.   We were born with traits that make it easier to succeed in one are than the other and/or we've been putting effort into one area rather than the other for most of our lives.<p>This is true of most of the nerds I know, male and female.   If you are good at everything?  yeah, you get to write your own very expensive ticket.   But most of us?   well, we chose to focus on one or the other, or we don't and we end up being well-rounded but mediocre.<p>The thing about this?   we make this decision before we are old enough to understand the implications.    If you are in college before you decide you want to work with computers, well,  I've already spent half my life up to that time practicing.   I mean, if you are that much better than me (and really hard working) you can catch up, but I've got a hell of a lead.<p>This is my personal pet theory to explain the difference in interest;  from an early age, boys are taught that they will be valued, mostly, based on what they can do; what they can make happen.  I knew that if I could make myself useful, there would be a place for me, society would value me, even if nobody really liked me very much on a personal level, even if I was ugly or unpleasant to be around.   Now, I wasn't a girl, so I don't know, but my impression is that this isn't what little girls are taught.<p>(Now, obviously, I have limited perspective here.   This is just what I observe in myself, and what I observe in my peers of both genders.   Most nerds seem socially... a little bit broken.  It seems to get better with age, but man, the socially optimized have a hell of a head start.  I'm sure there are many other factors, but this is how I personally rationalized the decision to become a nerd.)",1366776630

Cooling seems to be a driving factor, but was there anything else going on in her brain during that time (subconsciously perhaps) that can be seen through scans or such? Hopefully the practice of trying to revive people for longer periods of time becomes standard throughout medical practices--it'd hopefully save many lives and also perhaps reveal what is actually happening (in not just the brain, but the entire body) throughout the process and how to truly revive an individual if possible--and maybe when it is appropriate.<p>I've heard of this general concept several times before (coming back from the dead) as there are countless stories of people seemingly dying but becoming fully conscious after varying periods of time; however, this is the first time I heard about cooling being a considerable factor.

7243,comment,7240,7240,0,0,sanj,,,"It seems like folks lean towards S-corps, which are limited to US citizens.  LLCs cause problems when looking for money, or even wanting to allocate shares.  C-corps are expensive.  So, what can you do?<p>Create an S-Corp and give options (not shares) to a non-US shareholder?<p>Is there anything short of a C-corp?",1175172668

I couldn't figure out the name while I was reading th OM article - it was only when I saw their website I realized the name was i'm in like with you!<p>Do not have an accoun yet - can't comment on the service. On the surface, looks like an interesting idea.\n",1175172128
7241,comment,6668,7194,0,0,staunch,,,"I think this is the explanation for why YC gets hundreds and not thousands of applications.<p>Most hackers get jobs and generally make quite substantial income. Then they get comfortable with being able to provide for themselves well (and frequently a girlfriend or wife).<p>Even without kids there's a lot of commitment there. A 1 year lease on a nice apartment, a girlfriend/wife ""accustomed"" to living comfortably, car loan/insurance, etc.<p>Years of people doing this means that the highest potential founders have day jobs right now. For them paths to a startup are 1) Make a lifestyle change and go back to having little money. 2) Get sizable funding 3) Manage to pull off something in their spare time.<p>I think #2 and #3 are rarely successful, making #1 the most likely path to startup success for someone in this position.<p>Give up money, car, (nice) housing, girlfriend/wife(?), etc. to slave away with no life on a startup that will probably fail. Certainly seems like a good filter for determination, the most important attribute, the chances of success for these people must be higher.<p>I suppose YC figures that the potential for these people is not significantly high enough to justify the smaller number they could fund. Better to do 12 x $20k investments with 25% chance of success than 2 x $120k with a 50% chance.<p>\n",1175171794

7239,comment,6668,6668,0,0,kernwill,,,"Paul,\nGreat article, I found it extremely helpful and encouraging.  I did have one question though around point # 9. Family to support.  When you started Viaweb, did you have a family?  If not, what about when you founded Y Combinator?  The reason I ask is that I feel that having a family is a huge motivator for success, not a detractor.  Now it is extremely risky especially if you are the sole provider for the family, but the reward is extremely high.  If you have the confidence, determination and the right support (money, good business partners, etc.) your chances of success are increased.  That would be like saying that it is not wise to be an extreme sports athlete or even a race car driver if you have a family because it is too risky.  Calculated risks have great potential. <p>Will<p>",1175171288

I'm really fascinated to see what happens though, and I can't wait to start playing with it (even though I already have a gf who I asked out on facebook).",1175171006

7234,comment,6668,6869,0,0,elad,,,"Well you can just start a startup that works on hard problems, instead of one which revolves around your ajax code rendering correctly on various browsers.\nYou can solve a hard AI problem with a couple of good hacker friends, just as you could do that at Google. True that it'll probably take you more time than building another website around social networking. ",1175170375

All of the reputation/private arbitration systems that exist online still exist in the context of nations with laws that prevent, for example, someone killing you because you posted a bad review of them.  Or simply stealing your goods in person (&quot;X robbed me in the street and stole my clothes. I would not do business with him again&quot;).<p>Once you have established an upper limit on the kind of offensive actions that can be taken, it is easy to bootstrap reputation systems.  But I don&#x27;t consider this as evidence that there is a high defense/offense asymmetry at a <i>fundamental</i> level.",1388246355

6975228,comment,6974835,6974835,2,0,throwawaykf03,,,"Your title is different from your question. If you&#x27;re concerned about direct P2P connections, last I checked, Skype still sends voice traffic directly to the peer. I had checked some months ago using a packet sniffer while talking with a known peer. I&#x27;m on a mobile device so I can&#x27;t confirm now, but looking at my wireless router admin console, I still see the UPnP ports Skype has mapped for itself.<p>However if you want to avoid integration with the Microsoft universe (which should be opt-out IIRC, though I haven&#x27;t installed Skype on Windows in ages), you may need to look elsewhere. I was about to suggest Google Hangouts, but that&#x27;s just inviting integration with another universe :-)<p>WebRTC-based solutions may be a decent option long term, but I&#x27;m not convinced they&#x27;ll work as well as Skype or Hangout, because its NAT traversal is somewhat limited, so some peers may be unreachable, especially if corporate networks are involved. Skype and most P2P software perform a lot of hacks to get past NATs. Hangout, AFAIK, doesn&#x27;t have these problems as it is server-based.",1388246267

6975187,comment,6973545,6973545,3,0,shawnee_,,,"Living small(er) in order to minimize carbon footprint makes sense. <i>Green Metropolis</i> by David Owen is a fantastic book that makes the case for Manhattan being a great blueprint for the ideal city of the future -- people living more densely = less energy use individually & less &quot;space&quot; to accumulate stuff and waste.  Trash disposal in the city is such a complex problem that residents are literally forced to be economical about their consumption habits.  Traditional concepts of homesteading on the plains, whether  with large ranch houses or an &quot;eco&quot; house made of straw and mud are not necessarily ecologically friendly when there&#x27;s imperative need to drive to get to the nearest urban area for work, school, shopping, etc -- these, he argues, are the antithesis of efficiency.<p>Small eco-homes are not just a trend; they are the new era in real estate development.  But they need to be built such that they can collectively share infrastructures the same way city residents do.  The project I&#x27;m working on, applied to YC with (and was rejected from) last batch is built on this idea of more ecological homesteading <i>in order to create better</i> urban planning.  Masdar City <a href=\"http://www.masdarcity.ae/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.masdarcity.ae/en/</a> is an interesting prototype for the future of cities.  We&#x27;ve schooled our youngins enough for them to know that ecological awareness needs to be a lifestyle.

6975166,comment,6974494,6975055,5,0,sillysaurus2,,,"I just tried Kivy.  Thanks for telling me about it!  Kivy is pretty awesome: very easy to use, and it Just Works on all platforms, even mobile.  It&#x27;s also painless to deploy Kivy apps to users, which is great.<p>It&#x27;s hardware accelerated, so I can write my own custom GLSL shaders for the UI, which is pretty cool.  I bet I could even implement a Mario-style game using Kivy.  The main application window is just a GL context, and all the UI widget rendering is done via GL.<p>Unfortunately the Kivy UI seems to be riddled with bugs, and the UI widgets themselves are very alien.  For example, the Kivy file browser widget seems to be incomplete (it lacks basic features) and confusing (it behaves nothing like a native file selector).  So Kivy is probably too jarring of an experience for users... if I use Kivy in its current form, all my users would balk at the unintuitive UI, since Kivy&#x27;s widgets don&#x27;t look or feel anything like native platform widgets.  And since users would also be fighting Kivy&#x27;s UI bugs, I predict every user would immediately ragequit my app.  (E.g. drag-selecting text within multiline textboxes seems to be broken, etc.)<p>That said, Kivy is very close to being an effective way to effortlessly write crossplatform GUI apps.  The main reason to use Kivy is because it&#x27;s so easy to write useful apps with it.  I wrote one in about 15 minutes from start to finish.  The API is a pleasure to use, and the data binding design is especially brilliant.<p>Kivy seems pretty fantastic for writing internal tools. Data visualization via Python is now a cinch thanks to Kivy.  For example, it&#x27;d be easy to write an app that shows the current status of all your server instances.  And of course at that point it&#x27;d be easy to extend your app&#x27;s functionality with features like &quot;right click on a server instance to spawn an SSH session into it&quot;.  Stuff like that is a breeze thanks to Kivy.<p>Time to try out everyone else&#x27;s suggestions.  Up next: Clojure + Seesaw. (This thread has been incredibly helpful...  So many interesting ideas.

Here&#x27;s how I do it.<p>1 - Put in the disk\n2 - Boot to disk and run the installer\n3 - it reboots a couple times while it&#x27;s installing, but I don&#x27;t care because I&#x27;m off doing something else\n4 - it asks me a few questions and starts up\n5 - let it run through a bunch of update cycles (which <i>does</i> take forever, but it&#x27;s semi-automated so I&#x27;m doing something else most of the time)<p>On occasion I&#x27;ve had to install a network driver after it finishes, or if it&#x27;s virtualized some guest additions but that&#x27;s it. It does take hours, but they&#x27;re mostly unattended hours that I can ignore, and if I want to use the machine quicker, I can skip the update cycles and just get going and let it update when I shut the machine off at the end of the day.<p>My latest machine, which I just built, didn&#x27;t require <i>any</i> driver futsing.<p>I have <i>no</i> idea why you were trying to install 7 (and it sounds like your goal was to get to 8) on a <i>30GB SSD</i>. I wouldn&#x27;t install anything but a bare bones command-line only CentOS on a disk that small. It sounds like a couple days of your time were wasted trying to put a 50+GB OS on what&#x27;s essentially a medium sized thumb drive and suffered for it.<p>All that being said, back in the XP days I <i>did</i> build a system with Program Files on a different machine and for the most part it did work, but it wasn&#x27;t really well supported (even if it&#x27;s supposed to be) and felt kludgy.<p>The Registry is one of the worst ideas in the history of computing. Nearly every time I&#x27;ve had something go wrong with a Windows machine that wasn&#x27;t outright hardware failure, it was a problem with the registry. Registry editing really is a last resort for the bold and desperate. There&#x27;s some serious voodoo in there.<p>So we&#x27;ve solved two of your problems off the bat, 1) don&#x27;t install the OS on disks that are too small 2) don&#x27;t mess with the registry<p>On to small gripes<p>* No decent UNIX command line. Cygwin starts slowly and is poorly integrated with the system.<p>True. Your best bet if you want Linux is to virtualize a linux machine or install linux or use Powershell. Remember, you aren&#x27;t using a <i>nix.<p></i> I can&#x27;t get decent 2-finger scroll without a 3rd party program that is occasionally broken by system updates.<p>Touchpad support on Windows is lightyears behind OS X. Apple has actually turned the touchpad into something useful instead of an emergency replacement for a mouse. In Windows, just use a $5-10 2 button mouse with a scroll wheel.<p>* I can&#x27;t remap capslock without downloading a 3rd-party program to perform registry edits.<p>True.<p>* I can&#x27;t shut off the screen without installing a 3rd party program to do so.<p>What do you mean? Are you trying to just use the laptop hooked to a monitor and don&#x27;t want the monitor on? Just set the power management so you can close the lid and leave the machine on. It&#x27;s something that doesn&#x27;t exist in OS X so you probably haven&#x27;t thought of it.<p>* In Win7, all allowed keyboard layout switching shortcuts were combinations of modifiers that conflicted with productivity apps like Illustrator. Also, the layout would occasionally become &quot;stuck&quot; and failed to respect the GUI switcher. In Win8, they added a no-conflict key combination for switching layouts but it doesn&#x27;t work in fullscreen apps.<p>What do you mean? Why are you trying to switch the keyboard layout so much?<p>* Metro. It looks slick, but it doesn&#x27;t have any of the options you regularly need to access. Fortunately the old menagerie of Windows utilities is still there, just moved around.<p>No experience at all with 8, it looks like a version I&#x27;ll probably skip alltogether as 7 is still majority supported and I don&#x27;t have any compelling reasons to go to 8.<p>* No standard install system that lets you inspect the installer&#x27;s logs, scripts, or contents.<p>True. Installation under OS X is much slicker and better thought out in general than on Windows. What&#x27;s your compelling use case to need to do this though?<p>* The intimate connection between my computer account and Microsoft cloud account creeps me out.<p>Must be an 8 thing. 7 doesn&#x27;t really have anything like this (at least that I use or care about).<p>* The full-screen force-quit mechanism is insane (ctrl-alt-del, open Task Manager, press Windows to reveal the Launch Bar, click on the arrow to see all system tray icons, right-click the tiny Task Manager icon (a gray box), enable &quot;Always on Top&quot;, highlight the program in the task manager, hit &quot;End Task&quot;, wait, hit &quot;End Task&quot; on the dialog box that pops up, and finally decline to send a bug report to Microsoft)<p>Hit Ctrl-Shift-Esc, go to &quot;processes&quot;, right click on the problem process and just hit &quot;end process tree&quot;. I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re doing all that extra stuff <i>after</i> you&#x27;ve got the task manager up.<p>* I can&#x27;t use the keyboard to navigate directories that contain a mixture of files and folders because in Mircrosoft-Land &quot;Alphabetical Order&quot; means &quot;Sort folders first, then files.&quot;<p>Why not? I pretty much only navigate in Explorer via keyboard. Why does sorting folder first (which in my and many people&#x27;s opinions is far superior to mixing them up with your files) prohibit this?<p>It&#x27;s bad enough in OS X that most of the finder replacements I&#x27;ve tried change the sort to folders first then files. Folders <i>are</i> different then files and should be sorted separately. Between music, retrocomputing, movies, and photography I manage over 3 and a half million files using pretty much explorer from the keyboard without much fuss. It&#x27;s lightyears ahead of Finder in this respect.<p>One trick, with a folder open, just start typing the name of the file or folder you want and it&#x27;ll quickly navigate down to around where the file is.<p>* The sub-HD preloaded desktop backgrounds (yes, really).<p>Replace them with whatever you want. The built in Windows picture viewer is better than OS X&#x27;s (it even lets you look through folders full of pictures in sequence!) and you can right-click and turn any picture into a background.<p>* The ability to roll-back updates. It has never worked when I needed it to, but I like the idea.<p>Sometimes when your registry gets b0rk3d, this is the only way to save the computer. I don&#x27;t really like it at all when I try to use it manually, but it&#x27;s got my bacon out the fire on more than one occasion.",1388244025

Let me first of all dispel any notion that I don&#x27;t like learning languages &quot;for fun.&quot; See my Hacker News user profile for more details on what languages I have learned. I have learned enough facts about Sanskrit and the various languages that are written in the Devanagari alphabet to know<p>1) The written history of Sanskrit is much less that 3,000 years long. (The historiography of India is <i>hard,</i> because most of the writing materials used in ancient India were perishable, and thus much less preserved than the written records of other parts of the world that are equally old, but plainly the <i>Vedas</i> and other texts from ancient India are less than 3,000 years old.)<p>2) Yes, Sanskrit is an Indo-European language, which means it brings to mind features of other Indo-European languages. Each cognate language makes it easier to learn other cognate languages in turn. So you could gain an advantage in learning Sanskrit, for example, by learning German, Russian, and Greek first (as I have). Or you could learn Sanskrit first, as many secondary school students in India have done. But while learning each language, you might still ask yourself, &quot;What texts am I going to read, or what conversations will I have, now that I know this language?&quot; Sanskrit doesn&#x27;t have a particularly high degree of utility, if that is what you are looking for in a new language, for day-by-day communication today.<p>3) Finnish is not an Indo-European language, so it is not cognate to Sanskrit, and therefore learning Sanskrit doesn&#x27;t provide much advantage for learning Finnish. Come on, get the basis facts right. Learning Estonian would provide a huge boost for learning Finnish, of course. Learning Hungarian, Turkish, or even Mongolian would provide more remote advantages for learning Finnish.<p>4) Learning Tamil, Malayalam, or other languages of south India usually categorized as Dravidian (not cognate with Indo-European) languages just might give you a deeper understanding of India and its cultural heritage than the same effort spent learning Sanskrit. That&#x27;s something to think about if you like India and its culture, as I do.<p>5) If you would like to learn a language that maps well in its linguistic structure to first-order logic notation, I strongly recommend Chinese (Modern Standard Chinese or some other Sinitic language) over any Indo-European language, including Sanskrit. All languages have arbitrary grammatical rules. Strictly speaking, no language is more &quot;logical&quot; than any other.

Most tiny houses are built using stick framing, same as regular houses, with 6&quot; exterior walls and lots of insulation (higher insulation level than most regular homes), have level of interior trim that is similar to but usually better than regular homes.  Also most tiny houses are built so at least part of structure has very high ceilings, 11 to 12 feet, which greatly adds to feeling of spaciousness.  Tiny homes cost much more per square foot than regular size homes, but of course are much cheaper overall.  Even though they&#x27;re usually built on wheeled trailers and can be moved, they&#x27;re not built for constant moving.<p>In short, tiny homes are built to &quot;feel&quot; like a regular home, even though much smaller.

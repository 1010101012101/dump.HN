Just law does not punish acts that are in a ""gray"" area, which cannot be said with certainty to be crimes.

If you disagree with someone's blog post, write your own blog post and use a trackback to link it so there's still a conversation. This raises the bar for a few reasons. First, no one is going to keep a blog that has nothing but middlebrow dismissals or bad jokes, and if they do, no one will read it. Second, blogs have more of an identity and a reputation, so the author has stakes in the game greater than that of a disposable HN or Reddit account. Third, you can selectively follow a network of bloggers and if someone's a bozo, you just stop reading their blog instead of having to wade through their comments. Fourth, your responses on your own blog are more likely to be substantive because you have to make it worthwhile to your own blog's audience as well--introducing an issue and expressing your dissenting take on it can be worthwhile, but your standard drive by comment is not.",1359564008

That's the whole point of credentials.<p>In programming it is very difficult to verify expertise.  Programmers, especially self taught programmers, are usually very myopic.  Someone will learn one technology, and then they determine a candidates overall expertise based on knowledge of that one technology.  The problem is they've built up their entire ego based on learning just one thing and even got a job as a rails hacker or a javascript hacker or whatever.  That person thinks that they know how to determine expertise: just ask a bunch of very specific rails questions.  In reality there's a huge range of necessary expertise such as problem solving, debugging, interacting with people, using other languages and frameworks, databases, testing, operations.  But the ego takes over and says, ""I'm an expert in html, therefore html is all that's really important.""<p>Now you might say that if the interviewer finds someone who can do the specific skill, what's the problem?  The problem is that in a larger company, that one skill is a dime a dozen.  How is the candidate going to stack up when there are 400 rails hackers that can also do lots of other things.  As soon as its apparent the person can only do rails and is kind of dumb about other things, that's inviting huge criticism and job peril for the interviewers.  Small companies can enjoy their ignorant bliss.<p>The other class of interviewers are hiring managers who's egos are by their very nature amazing experts in all fields and technologies, but who's brains know absolutely nothing about software.",1359563740

And most people enjoy things that feel good. That's why we like orgasms, sugar, and salt  among other pleasures.<p>The problem with chemically addictive substances is that a few bad/ignorant decisions, made in those nearly universal pursuits of fitting in or feeling good, can change the chemical makeup of the brain and create a physical dependency. Addiction means you need the substance just to feel normal.<p>So yes, obviously, self-destructive behavior can be a coping mechanism for pain or helplessness. However, addictive substances like nicotine and opiates are often experimented with by people who have no special emotional pain (beyond the universal human pain you mention), but using the substance creates a hole, i.e., emotional lack, that can only be filled by the substance.<p>That's why cigarettes, heroin, etc. are so dangerous, and categorizing all addiction as ""inner pain"" the subject needs to work through is naive, in my opinion. Often the only inner pain is that caused by the addictive substance.<p>That said, I don't disagree with gesman's general premise for the psychological component of addiction; I just think it's overly broad and dangerously dismissive of the destructive power of addictive drugs.",1359563737

Every modern airliner is outsourced to a major and entire systems must be designed by the supplier that provides them. If the requirements are understood this usually isn't an issue.<p>Major components of an airliner are often designed and manufactured in geographically separate locations. In the case of Airbus each national entity has different processes in some cases and this has caused issues in the past. The 787 is no different in this respect where entire systems are manufactured and built by different entities and then transported for finally assembly. In the case of the 787, if the author is correct that modularization has caused the issues then one would expect that the largest issues would occur with the major elements such as wings as they are built entirely by a subcontractor in japan. Of course, there have been no such issues.<p>The electrical problems are probably driven more by the extreme demands placed on the power supply than anything else. It wasn't as if Boeing wasn't aware of the risks involved in choosing Li-ion batteries and was just blindsided by a supplier. It made the decision and then sold it to regulatory agencies. If it didn't understand how to make the batteries safe or it wasn't comfortable with the design Boeing should have rejected it.<p>Yes, we still don't know the root cause of the issues.

I got mentioned on twitter about this thread while I was on the bus.

Luckily, none of our API keys were actually in those files - our config is a bit different since you can still run RubyGems.org on Heroku, which needs to put secret keys in the ENV.<p>I deleted the exploit gems permanently along with the throwaway account that posted them...that's why this post's URL is a 404.<p>I've reset our S3 keys just to be sure and any other keys we had on our production site. From what we know right now, no other changes on our S3 bucket have taken place, and we're going to check the logs to make sure. Once we get a real fix for this issue out, pushing gems will be enabled again.<p>Just a general PSA -<p>Please, if you find an issue like this, be nice. Tell the maintainers privately.

It has more to do with anonymity by taking steps so people can't see who you are. By using Tormail there is still a chance that you can leak information about yourself and your contacts. Same goes for logging in to sites that carry your personal information.<p>If someone wants privacy then I would suggest using gpg/openpgp encryption for email/documents/etc., make sure https everywhere plugin is installed on your browser, noscript, adblock, etc. I suppose you get the same type of protection using the Tor Browser, also.<p>The problem is encryption.

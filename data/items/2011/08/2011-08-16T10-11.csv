2890677,comment,2890099,2890373,14,0,demallien,,,"You know, SpaceX has made such a huge difference to launch costs, that it is imaginable that the US could do a solo Mars mission.  To give a real-world example (well, sort of):<p>Juno was recently launched aboard an Atlas V, which launches for roughly the same price as the Falcon Heavy will in a year or so's time.  Juno gets placed into an orbit that will take it out beyond Mars' orbit, before returning to the Earth for a gravity-assist flyby.  The flyby is necessary to double the payload that they could otherwise send to Jupiter.<p>Falcon Heavy can left 3 times the payload of an Atlas V, so Juno could have increased in size, and avoided the 2 and a half years it will take to execute the Earth flyby manoeuvre, all for the same price.  Alternatively, a spacecraft 3 times the weight of Juno (which weighed in at 8000 pounds / 3500Kg) could be sent direct to Mars.<p>What could you do with all of that?  Well, the Mars Direct mission requires about 140 000kg, to be assembled in orbit.  That's about 14 Falcon Heavy launches, which has a total price tag of about US$1.4 billion.  Of course, on top of that there are in-orbit assembly costs, and the costs of the actual Mars-bound hardware, - which would roughly double the price tag to US$3 billion.  Without Falcon Heavy, that mission cost is doubled to US$ 6 billion.<p>I wonder what Juno would have looked like if it had three times the payload to play with...",1313492382

Continuation of the contract would presumably require payment.

2890637,comment,2887585,2888964,1,0,salvadors,,,"I think the metaphor is mostly lost on people who have never taken a business loan. Generally banks don't like lending money to companies purely to cover normal operational expenses. If you simply have cash-flow issues then a line of credit/overdraft is better. If you can't meet your costs out of income, then you want to either reduce costs or find an additional equity injection, not take a loan. Traditionally loans are for things that will grow the business, with a clear path to being able to repay it out of the additional income generated as a result. Obvious examples are buying expensive new equipment to let you produce something you sell at a greatly reduced cost, or opening new retail outlets.<p>The business world has a fairly well developed set of nuances around whether the debt a company has is good debt or bad debt. AIUI Ward's original point was simply that the ""all debt is bad"" approach doesn't work in business, and shouldn't be applied in so blunt a manner to technology either. Sometimes it's worth going into some debt now to achieve a future benefit. But, a business should be just as careful with its technical debt as its financial debt: only going taking it on with a clear (and well measured) path out again.<p>But, as you say, like pretty much any metaphor, stretch it too far, and it falls apart.",1313490839

6106971,comment,6106388,6106815,4,0,smsm42,,,"He went against his promises many, many times. And he still was re-elected. Which drives me to the conclusion that his voters are gullible enough to still believe in &quot;we&#x27;re going to change Washington&quot; - even though the person promising the change is has been in charge for years and the only change was to the worse. There was absolutely nothing to indicate that Obama is not a regular politician that would promise to change everything and change nothing. So I regard people that genuinely believed that would happen as gullible. Of course, some voted for him because of certain zero-sum agenda (&quot;he&#x27;ll take money/power from them and give to us&quot;) or because he&#x27;s &quot;our guy&quot; and not &quot;their guy&quot; - those are not among the gullible ones, as both do not imply you actually believe whatever the politician says, only that he would deliver the good in terms of giving the power/money. For some people, that worked splendidly, they are not gullible at all.",1374821972

6106965,comment,6104571,6104571,2,0,roasm,,,"Having worked in management in a large company, I have a little perspective from the other side:<p>Yes, there are laws that prevent you from employing a temp for an extended period of time. It&#x27;s somewhere around a year; I forget exactly, but it&#x27;s a law that attempts to protect temps from indefinite temp status. It&#x27;s supposed to compel the company to hire that temp if they really want them.<p>There are also laws that prevent you from hiring a temp back within some period of time, so the company doesn&#x27;t just skirt the issue by firing-then-hiring the temp with a one week break in the middle.<p>The reason a good temp isn&#x27;t hired has nothing to do with benefits. Benefits aren&#x27;t really that expensive relative to a knowledge worker salary.<p>The reason is because FT headcount is one kind of expense and contractors are another. The budget for FT head is very difficult to drop (it&#x27;s called layoffs) and actually grows every year because of raises. Contractors are part of slosh money (e.g., &quot;program spend&quot;).<p>So departments are told: &quot;You can have a head budget of $XX and a program budget of $YY.&quot; The implicit understanding is that $XX will hold or grow across budget planning (i.e., &quot;We won&#x27;t make you drop your head budget unless we&#x27;re actually doing layoffs or moving teams out of your department&quot;) and that the $YY can fluctuate.<p>Departments can generally spend the $YY any way they see fit, and often times, they need workers, so... temps. And if the company is financially stable (which I assume Amazon is), $YY doesn&#x27;t drop that much so you end up with a long time with enough $YY to keep temps on for a long time, but there isn&#x27;t enough faith in needing the department at that larger size to increase $XX enough.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen a lot of temps hang around for a year then get let go because there were just mediocre. Good enough to be productive, not bad enough to go recruiting again, and definitely not good enough to go use a bullet on fighting for increasing $XX. I&#x27;m not saying the OP is that case, but I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all seen the mediocre temp (or FT) worker hang on.<p>EDIT: I should add that I&#x27;m not at a large company any more. Co-founded a second startup. Woohoo!",1374821884

As a result, you can&#x27;t man-in-the-middle bitcoin and it remains secure even without centralized key signers, because you can increase your confidence by confirming a transaction with as many nodes as you want. This is how you validate a local block chain - you connect to enough other bitcoin clients in the swarm such that at some confidence threshold you agree your chain is the correct one. The usual number is 8 independent connections in the bitcoin network (both for blockchain verification and confirmation of transaction acceptance) because the probability of getting 8 bad actors agreeing to the same fraudulent transaction is mathematically demonstrated to be sufficiently low.<p>Note: that is (besides the 51% attack vector) the primary reason the bigger parts of the crypto scene won&#x27;t call bitcoin truly secure. Because there is still a risk of insecurity, it is just abysmally small, and disrupting one node doesn&#x27;t mean the degradation of the web of trust because as long as the majority still agrees on the correct state of affairs (and as a false block chain diverges it becomes more expensive to maintain that public facing fork to disrupt other clients).",1374818777

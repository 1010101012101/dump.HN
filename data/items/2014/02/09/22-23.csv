How does it <i>not</i> encourage creativity?<p>As an example, just listen to Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Stronger&quot; and compare that to the original source of the sample, Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot;, which itself prominently samples Edwin Birdsong&#x27;s &quot;Cola Bottle Baby&quot;.<p>Now imagine neither Daft Punk nor Edwin Birdsong was ever compensated or asked permission for Kanye&#x27;s work, and neither was Edwin Birdsong compensated or asked permission for Daft Punk&#x27;s usage. Is that in any way fair? Both the newer songs essentially owe their popularity to that single iconic sample!<p>If you don&#x27;t want to go the legal route by getting permission to reuse others&#x27; music, then make an entirely original song.

Rappers are more akin to poets than musicians, the way you are using the word <i>musician</i>. The musicians in rap are called producers - they make the backing tracks. The appeal includes: complex technical rhyming, nuanced delivery (&#x27;flow&#x27;), vignette painting, storytelling, wordplay including numerous puns, double-entendre, and punchlines, some backing tracks are actually epic, or especially funky, i.e. they have merit as music.

7207794,comment,7205385,7205385,1,0,osdiab,,,"I don&#x27;t see it this way—that learning to code is in some way less elegant and less conceptual than learning computer science. That &quot;it&#x27;s not science&quot; anymore. Rather, your idea of &quot;learning to code&quot; is just operating at a higher level of abstraction from your idea of &quot;learning computer science.&quot;<p>When you start with primitives like array.sort(), you&#x27;re implicitly bringing the organization of a program or system as a whole to the forefront, while abstracting way the mechanics of that sorting process. This is a good place to start understanding individual computer programs and systems.<p>When you start with primitives at the logical and mathematical level (i.e. theory), you&#x27;re bringing the organization of lower-level concepts like data and control structures to the forefront. This is a good place to start when understanding the components that go into higher-level primitives like &quot;sorting.&quot;<p>And you can go up and down in terms of the level of abstraction you want to view computer systems. Go higher, and you&#x27;ll think more about the way multiple computer systems integrate (this is precisely what frameworks, APIs, and SDKs tackle). Go lower, and you&#x27;ll think more about the way hardware interacts with machines (which, ironically, brings us back to electrical &quot;engineering&quot;—not science!).<p>To me, it&#x27;s all just layers of abstraction, and the layer you choose should just be the one you find natural, interesting, and maybe useful. It&#x27;s not a strict hierarchy; there are branches and perhaps cycles. But our understanding of the systems that run industry today, are only possible upon a complex system of abstractions that goes all the way down to the physics of the universe.<p>There are patterns and antipatterns to understand when &quot;learning to code&quot; (at the systems level), just like there are patterns and antipatterns to understand when &quot;learning computer science&quot; (at the theoretical level), but they just operate at different levels.<p>The term &quot;computer science&quot; implies that it is science, and not engineering. I think that the main reason theory is seen more as an &quot;academic&quot; pursuit as opposed to more abstracted understanding of computer systems is precisely because it has been so thoroughly abstracted, that trying to operate on a purely theoretical basis is just too inefficient to be particularly &quot;useful&quot; in an engineering setting, by some metric. It&#x27;s not because of innate beauty or complexity; it&#x27;s just where that arbitrary line is drawn.",1391986680

7207788,comment,7206090,7207546,1,0,waps,,,"Just correction a misconception here. The human brain &quot;boots&quot; on the 18th day after conception (you can set your watch to it). It is obvious on echo pictures that coherent thoughts are present on the 21st day after conception (e.g. if awake, most kids are aware that they&#x27;re being pictured and attempt to find and play with the source of the sound, I think that qualifies as coherent thought).<p>It is quite obvious on the 23rd day that fetuses are swimming around and exploring their environment purposefully. They are at least as alive and coherent at that time.<p>The reason for this is that your DNA does not contain a plan for a human being. It contains a plan for a bilobite (an very old and presumed extinct form of life), and a way to transform a bilobite into a trilobite, a trilobite into something that resembles a fish, that fish into something very similar to a frog larva, and so on and so forth until you get a human. Other species have the same evolution in the womb/egg, except it diverges at some point.<p>The fish has a working brain (and it is unknown whether the trilobite does, it grows active neurons), generally referred to as a neural tube.

7207786,comment,7202146,7207172,1,0,dkuntz2,,,"I think the emphasis on containment and local understanding is good, especially considering that programs are getting huge (which is a separate problem, and what I think really needs to get fixed). With huge programs it&#x27;s infeasible to fully comprehend the whole program, which means the only thing you can really do is hope that other programmers&#x27; functions work as advertised, and focus on perfecting your local domain.<p>The easiest way to alleviate this, in my opinion, is to focus on building smaller programs which focus on doing one thing well, and combining those together to create larger applications, with preferably a minimum of glue code. In my mind this leads to even more containment as each domain is now accessible only through the specified API.<p>This could lead to similar problems that you have with the deemphasis of global understanding, because it&#x27;s still compartmentalizing things, and at each higher level the programmer is just trusting that the lower levels have implemented what they said they would, just like in a huge, single program.<p>The idea of being T-shaped specifically when it comes to the overall knowledge of the projects you work on seems to be the best way to work on those applications: have a general understanding of the whole project, and a really good understanding of your specific domain (and perhaps an intermediate understanding of those around yours).",1391986564

In the CS department at my university, the only language used for the first 3 years is C.  But all of the courses are split in to a &quot;lecture&quot; and &quot;lab&quot; component.  In lecture you learn about Computer Science; you learn data structures, algorithms, computational complexity, graph theory, proofs, summations, stats, combinatorics, etc.  In lab you learn Programming; you implement a lot of these algorithms and data structures in C.<p>Abstract vs. Concrete Data Types are introduced very early as representations for the theoretical structures discussed in class and then we are given projects that can be solved using concepts and theorems introduced with the expectation that we will implement the appropriate structures and algorithms in C.  The code itself is read over carefully and just as important as whether the output is good.  Now, this is partially a luxury afforded by my university&#x27;s small size; freshman and sophomore CS classes aren&#x27;t taught in 200 person lecture halls, they&#x27;re 30-40 students at the max.

You model them, write proofs, recurrence relations, graphs, etc. on exams, and implement them in projects so that you show an aptitude for both the theory and the mechanics.<p>By the time you hit your fourth year, you take Programming Languages and Theory of Computation.  Automata/Machines, Grammars, BNF, Compilers, etc. in lecture; seeing these concepts applied by studying and writing code in OO languages, LISPs, and Prologs in lab.

If you are implementing a low performance requirement CRUD app, certainly you can become an effective programmer without knowing the low level details.<p>But if you want to be an engineer? Good luck. I&#x27;ve worked with people that didn&#x27;t know the stuff behind C, and they are pretty useless as soon as performance matters, or you need to talk to hardware, or crank through a lot of numerical computations, minimize watt usage of a cellphone, app, debug complicated situations, and so on. They don&#x27;t have a good mental model of the machine in their mind, and so they cannot figure out what is going on, reason about the performance of a modern chip, and so on.<p>There are a lot of arguments for expediency on HN. Probably it is partially justified, but I will always advocate for an engineering education, as opposed to a &#x27;learn rails in 3 weeks and get a job&#x27; approach.

To stick with the python, what happens if the python implementation is buggy? There is a large subset of programmers that can not cope with that situation.<p>Why limit yourself?

You go there to buy as much as you can so that you can avoid shopping for the rest of the week.<p>But around here, Pike Place Market? Westlake Center? Pacific Place? Yeah. Most of their business comes from the fact that they&#x27;re within walking distance from the Financial District and the Convention Center. Uwajimaya? Benefits immensely from the fact that it&#x27;s located <i>in Chinatown</i>, where its main market is; I&#x27;m two blocks from it and I pick up something every other day on my way home from work.<p>(Actually, Uwajimaya is brilliant in that it has apartments on top and parking below. A lot of residents are literally walking through the store to go home.)<p>> Or on a small scale, I&#x27;d be more likely to go to a restaurant or small retailer if I knew for certain I couldn&#x27;t get there on foot and if I drove there, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to park?<p>No, you&#x27;re reversing it. The question is about how many more customers a restaurant or small retailer would get. I didn&#x27;t fully explain: it starts by recognizing that the number of customers you get is a percentage of the number of <i>potential</i> customers you get. If you already knew about that restaurant 50 miles out, then obviously, the only thing that matters is that you can get there. That&#x27;s a transit issue: can you get to point B from point A in a reasonable amount of time, for a given understanding of reasonable. Some people cannot imagine reasonable amounts of time via public transit, so they cannot conceive of transit without cars.<p>That&#x27;s a different problem. The problem here is that, using a &quot;cars = customers&quot; model, you have two facts: (a) most people don&#x27;t look at the storefronts as they drive by. They&#x27;re actually looking for parking. Your parking space is a loss leader in order to get them to look at what you&#x27;re selling in the first place, on their way <i>somewhere else</i>. And (b), people don&#x27;t know you exist until they see you.<p>If you already knew about it, then it&#x27;s more akin to parking at your office. You have no need for discoverability, just availability. If you had magical public transit that was equally fast, you could use it instead and poof. No need for cars at all. The merits of cars versus other things isn&#x27;t customers; it&#x27;s speed.<p>> I&#x27;ve seen poor parts of downtown with empty sidewalks and boarded up storefronts. Must be the parking lots?<p>In short, yes. What if those parking lots were cheap housing instead? You wouldn&#x27;t need a car to get there, and you could walk across the street to shop.<p>This isn&#x27;t a silver bullet &quot;delete parking lots = magically better&quot;. It&#x27;s a functional component of many other much larger, much more complex solutions. I&#x27;m telling you why the component is being included--namely the space efficiency of pedestrians equals a higher customer base--but that isn&#x27;t a complete solution by any means.<p>I mentioned a and b earlier. There is a c.<p>Anytime your parking lot isn&#x27;t nearly full during business hours, you have a problem.<p>Why? The reason that cars = customers is because cars forcibly disallow anyone else from being a customer. When you design your street for cars, you discourage pedestrians: especially the window shoppers. When you design your neighborhoods to be zoned between residential and commerce, you make it impossible to reach businesses except by car or long-distance public transit.<p>My grandparents live in a suburban cul-de-sac in the Bay Area. Pretty place. Very calm and peaceful. And they&#x27;re lonely. My parents and uncles and aunts have to regularly drive in from across town to visit with them. Couldn&#x27;t they go down to the local store, rather than asking a son or daughter-in-law to buy groceries? Nope. They&#x27;re too frail to drive, and walking the massive block to the huge nearby intersection, and then walking across the vast expanse of asphalt to the nearby Lucky&#x27;s is basically impossible. Hell, I hate doing it and I jog the whole thing for fun. There isn&#x27;t even anything on the way to stop at. There&#x27;s like... one bench for the bus stop. A Radio Shack on the other side of the 3-lane road. There are actually quite a few other options; they&#x27;re just even further away.<p>You basically need a car to get to what is technically a block and a half away, if we count by intersection. My god-grandparents would be in a similar situation, but they&#x27;re able to drive, so they can do the 20 or so blocks it takes to get to the Asian market.<p>It wasn&#x27;t always a Lucky&#x27;s.

My rant was inspired by a discussion of a workplace issue where it was not clear cut if the man was &quot;behaving badly&quot; or not but it was clear that the woman wanted him to behave differently towards her. I was roundly criticized for suggesting that dressing more conservatively for a time in response to the issue might help convey a lack of romantic interest in the man without being confrontational. I was told how she dressed at work had absolutely nothing to do with how men at work treated her, the man was merely a creep, etc. We only knew her side of the story. Perhaps he was a creep. Perhaps not.<p>Saying &quot;it&#x27;s all his fault, he is merely a creep!&quot; is a) jumping to conclusions without knowing both sides of the story and b) pretty disempowering for the woman. If he is merely a creep and the things the woman does are irrelevant, that leaves you with what? Quit your job or put up with unwanted attentions? Not a great set of choices if, like most people, you need your paycheck. I am proposing that dress and behavior can influence how men treat a woman and if you are a woman who is serious about having a career, you should take some responsibility for your half of it and not just bitch about how all men are led around by their pecker and there is nothing a woman can do about it.<p>I did work for a Fortune 500 company for over 5 years. I did deal (very diplomatically) with unwanted male attention on the job. I have also dealt with that in other professional situations. This is not just someone blowing smoke based on zero experience or research.<p>As a woman who (somewhat to my bafflement) comes across as a LOT more aggressive than I wish I did, I assure you that a woman who reads as super aggressive on the job is doing herself no favors. Female passivity is pretty expected in most social settings. Being too aggressive gets you all kinds of attention of the wrong sort and does not help your career.<p>I have also been sexually assaulted (as a child) and have read a lot about the topic. This is not really the place to argue that issue but I will suggest that a woman can dress conservatively and not read as submissive or passive. I tend to dress conservatively. I also tend to be mistaken for someone in charge, sometimes in situations where I am at the bottom of the ladder, not the top.",1391984759

It doesn&#x27;t state you can&#x27;t build a &quot;perfect voting system&quot;.  It states that you can&#x27;t build a voting system that will always conform to the different criteria that Arrow chose for the theorem.  But it doesn&#x27;t attempt to prove or justify that those four criteria are absolutely required for a &quot;perfect voting system&quot;.<p>&quot;Independence Of Irrelevant Alternatives&quot; is thought to be particularly problematic.  There definitely are thought experiments that demonstrate that IIA is not as desirable a criteria (to rule out a voting system) as you would want.  If a voting ballot runs afoul of IIA, it can point more to a confused voting population than a flawed voting method.<p>For instance, the Condorcet Criterion runs afoul of IIA.  The Condorcet Criterion states that if a candidate would beat every other candidate one-on-one, that candidate would be the winner.  Apparently it is possible to introduce additional candidates (that don&#x27;t change the relative rankings between pre-existing candidates) such that a Smith Set is instead produced.  However, it is not possible to introduce additional candidates such that a different Condorcet Winner is produced.<p>But let&#x27;s think about what that says.  A Smith Set is not a problem in itself.  It means an indecisive or conflicted voting population.  It is interesting that additional candidates can expose a conflicted voting population, a confusion that actually already was there; just covered up by the lack of candidates.  In other words, if IIA changes a result from a Condorcet Winner to a Smith Set, it is an indication that the population <i>was not given enough choice</i> in the original ballot.<p>In that sense, IIA is actually useful, and not a flaw.  It does not point out a flaw with the Condorcet voting mechanism; it points out a flaw with the limited choice of candidates (and time to research/understand those candidates) for that vote.<p>This is part of the problem with voting theory, is that they make unwarranted theoretical assumptions, such that a vote will always offer sufficient choice to a voting population.  At any rate, I believe IIA is a flawed criterion, and therefore the Impossibility Theorem, while true, is less useful than it is celebrated to be.",1391984614

The GPL <i>does</i> allow this, but it is not in the spirit of the GPL, and the Affero GPL was created to deal with this problem.",1391983605

If anything you can put the cost onto society as a whole. This is the type of insurance the ACA should have been instead of the crap we got. It should have covered catastrophic care, which means million dollar babies provided they can be saved.<p>No company should feel guilty not keeping up benefits because one or two cases blew the bank. They are not there to fix everything. Insurance is a benefit and benefits can be exhausted or become so costly that the cost of doing business means not being in business.<p>So yeah, it sucks. Welcome to the world. The solution is to put catastrophic care into the hands of government and let them decide who gets the care. Let employers and everyday people shop for the best care for non catastrophic care and do it across state lines. Put them all on equal footing.<p>So summary.\n1) Government takes care of catastrophic care. They set the limits, the decide who. If you want more you buy it on the secondary market.\n2) Individuals and business buy insurance from any/all provides regardless of state.

Brainfuck is a valid homework medium.<p>*  A relevant ISA such as ARM -- We can let Thumb/2 be bonus points, but the real goal is just to convey that ISA&#x27;s are usually written to take the most generally abstractable things you would do with a Turing machine and do it more succinctly and faster in hardware.<p>*  Build a function stack with the goal of understanding how procedures become generalized by calling conventions or optimized by inlining.  The lesson is that we stay pure for flexibility and get dirty for raw speed.<p>*  Introduce Scheme and tail recursion optimization.  Now the whole of functional programming and the abstractions -- and their optimizations -- are opened up with a firm footing in the machine.<p>Turing and Church probably did write most of CS, so it&#x27;s obvious that you want to relate the two to create the most generally useful bridge concepts for the rest of the long life of a programmer, that if they never let up, will inevitably touch both high-level and low-level languages.<p>OS&#x27;s are the final frontier here, but cannot possibly be squeezed down due to things like MMU functionality totally clouding up what is what.  Making a machine look like it belongs to the program is what OS&#x27;s are good at, and this is a different kind of abstraction to grok than the relationship between the machine and the programmer.",1391983423

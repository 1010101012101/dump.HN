8248647,comment,8248300,8248547,7,0,abelsson,,,"The problem is that Germany, with its focus on wind and solar, is paying twice as much as for electricity compared to France - also a country with higher density in the middle of Europe - while also emitting more carbon dioxide per capita (9.6 vs 6.1 tons per capita). The difference is that France made the right decision 30 years ago when they transitioned from oil and coal to nuclear power for power generation. Solar and Wind are a much more expensive way of accomplishing the same thing. Der Energiewende is both expensive and inefficient.",1409468206

Here&#x27;s what you said:<p>> Asperger&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t &quot;abandoned,&quot; it was folded into the broader spectrum of autism ...<p>Your claim above is that the condition known as Asperger Syndrome was folded into the autism category. In fact, those individuals with the Asperger diagnosis were folded into the autism category (strictly speaking, only 45% of them, under the new rules), along with the symptom set, which now has no significance as a diagnosis, but the Asperger Syndrome term has been abandoned, and clinicians are advised to stop providing the diagnosis. According to one of those behind this change:<p>“Asperger’s means a lot of different things to different people,” Dr. Lord said. “It’s confusing and not terribly useful. ...

Asperger Syndrome never represented a distinct, identifiable condition separate from mild autism (&quot;“Asperger’s means a lot of different things to different people,” Dr. Lord said. “It’s confusing and not terribly useful.”&quot;), and its rate of diagnosis was far above anything realistic. It threatened to become as big an embarrassment to psychology as recovered memory therapy, facilitated communication or pre-frontal lobotomy.<p>Imagine a group of doctors voting cancer out of a medical textbook.

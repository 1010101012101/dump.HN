Of these two scenarios, which do you find more likely?<p>A. Your parent comment knows just as much as you do about whatever &quot;oversight&quot; is notionally exerted over the NSA, but chooses to describe it as &quot;zero&quot; for rhetorical reasons, such as for example a functional equivalence to what might happen in the case where the NSA actually outranked everything else in the country.<p>B. Your parent comment actually believes that in the US government org chart, the NSA is at the very top.<p>I lean toward scenario (A), in which case your response has all the value of &quot;does not, infinity!&quot;  In general, saying &quot;what you said is incorrect <i>because you&#x27;re wrong</i>&quot; just makes you sound even more uninformed than the guy saying &quot;but that&#x27;s wrong!&quot;  If you&#x27;ve got something to back yourself up with, use it, don&#x27;t just assert that it&#x27;s there.<p>> This, too, is a false statement and conjecture.<p>Wow!

7329133,comment,7327470,7327470,1,0,joeblau,,,"This sucks and Im sorry for the situation you&#x27;re in.  I was in a reverse situation a year ago where I was pushed out of a company where I actually started working on an MVP. That situation taught me a lot about core founders of any project.  It showed me that founders need to be 100% committed and bought in/sold out.  A few questions I would ask to gauge whether or not your co-founder was committed would be:<p>1. Did he invest any money into the project or just time?<p>2. If <i>you</i> quit would he run with the project without you?<p>3. Did you treat him like a co-founding member or like an engineer that you just found and put on the team.<p>With regard to #1.  The current project that I&#x27;m co-founding with a good friend is in a position where we are both committing time and financial resources to completing the project.  Both of us are taking 100% responsibility.  There is true palpable excitement as we are working on the project and we are both individually motivated to push the project forward. If either of us need access to an online product (Version Control, Databases, Software program, IDE), we&#x27;ll chat about it and he or I will buy it.<p>With regard to #2. If he wouldn&#x27;t continue running the project without you, I would question how loyal he was to the project.  I was offered a co-founder/CTO position a month ago and I had to be 100% honest with the founders and let them know that while I think the project is amazing and needed, I didn&#x27;t wake up thinking about solving the problem.  Some developers might not be able to communicate how they truly feel; An exit to another company is a clear sign that they probably weren&#x27;t truly passionate about the project.<p>With regard to #3. I met a kid who just came to San Francisco late last year and was looking for an iOS developer to build a product.  I could clearly tell from conversation that he saw me as a developer building <i>his</i> product and not as a partner working on a project together.  Every idea I had was immediacy shut down with no room for discussion and I was even told at one point that one of my ideas was &quot;Fucking stupid.&quot; I&#x27;m not sure about your relationship with your co-founder but this may have been an issue from his point of view.<p>I hope you find a new cofounder, one that is passionate about solving the problem that you&#x27;re trying to solve.",1393768340

If I had time, I&#x27;d definitely want to do a 2.0 that gives it a small haircut removing the most bothersome of problems.  I&#x27;ve been unable find time for work required: about a year of discussing, writing, coding, testing, packaging, and forging consensus.<p>What I&#x27;d keep in YAML is the information model.  When we started YAML ~12 years ago, it was <i>obvious</i> that configuration should be in XML, and that XML&#x27;s information model was the correct way to organize data structures. Part of YAML&#x27;s work was explaining a different way of doing things to those who&#x27;d otherwise use XML.  This isn&#x27;t a concern these days...<p>That said, the productions look painful because the specification doesn&#x27;t separate the scanner from the parser. Once you do that, the syntax is quite a bit more sane to grok (see PyYAML source).  It&#x27;s not nearly as bad as what you may think... IF you see it this way.<p>Besides a few unfortunate syntax structures, YAML&#x27;s complexity and sharp edges comes from it&#x27;s venture into  typed objects, type-spaces, and implicit typing.  Much of this, for configuration files, is unnecessary.<p>When we wrote YAML, we only had a few years experience with it; and well, it wasn&#x27;t done as a full time endeavour.  It was a guess as to how things should work.  It wasn&#x27;t easy to bootstrap YAML. It&#x27;s now ten years later... and, well, lots of people have experience with it.  It&#x27;s probably time for the haircut.",1393768194

A degree is usually worth the cost of college, even if the price tag is increasingly tough to bear.</i><p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that &#x27;a degree is usually worth the cost&#x27; but even if it were the case that going to college were the optimal decision for each individual who chooses to go, this locally optimal decision doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s good that &#x27;more students than ever before are attending college&#x27;.<p>A college credential could have a positive NPV for each person thinking of getting one, but still be negative for the group overall.

AngularJS, the writing is clearly on the wall. Google are investing in a number of libraries and technologies that are the &quot;next thing&quot;: Polymer, Dart, Web Components + Shadow DOM in Chrome etc. It appears that in the big picture AngularJS is a stepping stone, which is a problem when you plan on building something that should be supportable for 5+ years.<p>Remember GWT? 5 years ago it was all the rage. At the 2012 Google I/O event they announced they&#x27;re handing over control to a steering committee - their way of letting go and moving on. Imagine if you needed to continue supporting GWT based code for another few years, when the catalyst for the technology are phasing it out themselves. The worst part of this is the lack of developers - they see Google dumping GWT and stop learning about it. How do you hire developers to continue maintaining your software? This should qualify as being &quot;in a rut&quot;.<p>So it begs the question, should an organization start using AngularJS (or any other fashionable framework trend) for long-term support systems?

My experience with jobs (granted, I&#x27;ve worked in some of the most volatile sectors of the economy) is that the <i>median</i> case outcome is that it&#x27;s not worth coming in to work after 12 months. I achieve a lot quickly, but most companies don&#x27;t really think they need much high-level work. I desperately want to find the 5+ year fit, but I&#x27;m not one for self-deception.<p>When I heard that only half of venture-funded companies live 5 years, to me that sounded like excellent odds. I would kill to find a job where there&#x27;s a 50/50 chance that it&#x27;s still worth coming to work after 5 years. My experience is that unless you can convince someone in upper management to take you on as a protege (and that&#x27;s 95% luck, because they&#x27;re usually not technical people) you are wasting time after one year. Internal mobility (i.e. the ability to self-allocate to something better suited to one&#x27;s talents and shine) should fix this in theory, but in practice most large companies do a terrible job on that front: bad performers (whether they are actually bad, or just have a shitty manager) can&#x27;t move because no one wants them, but good performers&#x27; managers won&#x27;t let them.

And yeah, this is getting too <i>taxing</i> on my time too :p<p>> For one thing, I might want to control the laptop you paid for, so it&#x27;s clearly leaving something important out.<p>Blindingly obviously, &quot;value you want to control&quot; only applies when you&#x27;ve produced or legitimately acquired that value, through a voluntary exchange for example. But I think this idea covers all property, regardless of whether it&#x27;s a house or a book you wrote. There&#x27;s no point in bickering about &quot;what if you don&#x27;t want to control the value you&#x27;ve produced? -is it property then?&quot; .. etc, what you want to do with value under your control is up to you.<p>As for an apple in your hand, yes, of course it depends on the context, but it&#x27;s pointless to confound the issue like that. The point was that <i>in general</i>, anything that&#x27;s already in your possession is automatically considered your property, and there&#x27;s no need for a central state to &quot;enforce&quot; that - it&#x27;s just our intuitive understanding of property.<p>> Reasonable levels of taxation, determined democratically and enforced fairly, don&#x27;t violate any of these.<p>There is no reasonable level of extortion, and it&#x27;s not like <i>we</i> get to determine it democratically anyway.<p>But how exactly do you think a portion of our property could, in fact, be the government&#x27;s property instead? -Because &quot;we&quot; (hah!) have &quot;democratically determined&quot; a certain level of taxation? Does taxation mean some of your property magically <i>turning into</i> the government&#x27;s property? -How does that work? :p<p>Or perhaps more pertinently, does a piece of paper grant some people rights that others don&#x27;t have? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ngpsJKQR_ZE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ngp...</a> .. or the flipside, does a piece of paper magically <i>prevent</i> the government from shipping people off to Guantanamo and torturing them for months?<p>Here are the correct answers, for your convenience: &quot;No&quot; and &quot;No&quot;.<p><i>Oh, but silly me! I&#x27;ve overlooked the democratic process again, which gives the government ownership of a portion of our bodies, and they&#x27;re certainly free to use their property as they please! In Guantanamo&#x27;s case, they&#x27;re using portions of some people&#x27;s bodies to inflict pain on the other parts! But it&#x27;s obviously a perfectly legitimate use of one&#x27;s property!</i><p>> I am not confident it is correct to generalize it to &quot;all transfers through coercion are illegitimate&quot;. Restorative transfers (giving you your laptop back) seem clearly legitimate<p>Your stolen laptop never ceased to be your legitimate property.<p>> Most people feel that some amount of taxation is legitimate<p>Yes, you could say that. But why is that, and have they thought things through?<p>Imagine you&#x27;re a murderous, psychopath warlord, and you&#x27;re looting a population of say, 100 000 people through active violence. You want to keep looting other people, because you just want money and power and you&#x27;re a psychopath, right? But would you also like to minimize the risks and effort involved?<p>For example, the longer you continue your violent oppression, the higher the likelihood that one of your victims decides to risk his life in an attempt at killing you. Clearly, that&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t want to happen, because they might actually succeed, and then you&#x27;d be dead and unable to continue looting everyone!<p>Not only that, but your henchmen would prefer not having to keep risking their own well-being by actively subjugating the general population. Someone might hurt them too!<p>But what if the population you&#x27;re looting stopped resisting? What if you could loot them all their lives, without any risk to your personal well-being, and without the need for such a large number of henchmen eating into your loot?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be awesome if you could get the population to believe that your looting is actually <i>necessary</i> and <i>beneficial</i> to them? You know, if you set up an &quot;education&quot; system, you might be able to shape their thinking into something conducive to effortless looting! Perhaps something like the Prussian system: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_education_system"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_education_system</a> - <i>As the German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte, a key influence on the system, said, &quot;If you want to influence [the student] at all, you must do more than merely talk to him; you must fashion him, and fashion him in such a way that he simply cannot will otherwise than what you wish him to will.&quot;</i><p>( <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLmmQ8peduhsoaTpJELl6a9P-tU5NyCSym&feature=player_detailpage&v=kTx000GcKL4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLmmQ8peduhsoaTpJELl6a9P-t...</a> )<p>That would certainly get you quite far, but would it be enough? Perhaps you could offer them some services too? If you could convince your victims that without your security services, there would be chaos and mayh- nay, <i>anarchy</i> on the streets, you could make it much more difficult to dismantle your looting system.<p>If you could, then, add helping other people into the mix, that would be a delightfully convoluted mess for anyone to pick apart! I mean, if someone woke up and realized you&#x27;re looting everyone, he&#x27;d face massive resistance from everyone around him! Others would be angry at him for wanting poor people to suffer and die of starvation, and what kind of a monster would want innocent children deprived of education?! -They&#x27;d get nowhere in life without proper education!<p>..

7329032,comment,7328856,7328856,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"Snarky but true answer: <i>failure is not always good.</i><p>Look, I&#x27;m all for removing the social penalties to good-faith failure. I&#x27;ve failed before (in good faith) and I&#x27;m a good guy. Some problems are harder than they look, and sometimes the solution is brilliant but no one wants it. However, I can&#x27;t share that cavalier attitude toward <i>failure</i> that I often encounter in the HN-sphere. I would love to see society become more tolerant of good-faith failure or just bad luck, on the small scale (R&D efforts within companies) as well as the large (bankruptcy laws, a healthcare system that isn&#x27;t psychotic and mean-spirited like US insurance). However, I&#x27;ve also seen what bad-faith failure looks like: businesses that might start with earnest intention but evolve into long cons. People who call themselves &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; are not all ethical. Some are, some aren&#x27;t.<p>Failure hurts people. Money disappears, jobs are lost, and sometimes peoples&#x27; careers get ruined. I&#x27;ve lost about $500,000 (mostly, opportunity cost and career retardation) to bad startups.<p>Sometimes failure is no one&#x27;s fault and a learning experience. Sometimes, there&#x27;s some serious malfeasance behind it. If you&#x27;ve been around tech as long as I have (and I&#x27;m only 30) you know that there are some really wonderful people, but also some really terrible people, in it.<p>There are some severe issues involved in the question of how to handle business failure: moral hazard, asymmetric risk. Most people attack these hard ethical questions by falling back on instinct and social proof: the way they separate bad-faith and good-faith failure is by asking around, checking references, reading news articles. That&#x27;s how the Valley works: it tolerates failure if you can convince it that you failed in good faith, but the waters are so murky that social proof rules the day. That, predictably, makes the worst kinds of people (social influence peddlers) powerful, and they evolve into extortionists and manipulators. It turns into a feudalistic reputation economy. It&#x27;s not a scalable solution. It&#x27;s actually hypocritical, because a world in which reputation and social access matter that much is <i>exactly</i> the sort of world that becomes risk-averse and sclerotic. (That takes time, but you see it happening in the Valley.)<p>The happy medium is somewhere in between the risk-averse conservatism of Europe and the Midwest, and the pro-failure attitude of California, which arrives either at recklessness or hypocrisy. Maybe Seattle? (I&#x27;m considering moving to the PNW in 2015, so I&#x27;ve given this a lot of thought.)",1393766176

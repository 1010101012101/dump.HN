As legend tells it he lashed up a demo version over a weekend and pitched it successfully in the corridor shortly thereafter. The rest is history.<p>MSBuild is essentially a clone ant, and it&#x27;s not a bad tool per se. For the devdiv engineering team it allowed them to get off the horrible pre-msbuild project files.<p>The messiness came with solution files (since VS uses solution files and project files). Unfortunately, they left the also awful solution files around. And this added an alternate way to specify dependencies between projects. VS solution files are awful to maintain - just a bag of guids that makes resolving conflicts very hard for humans and VS is poor at automatically resolving them (very noticeable when you get >3 developers on a project).<p>The solution to the messiness would be to use an MSBuild project file instead of a solution file. It&#x27;d have to conform to a schema VS understands, but it&#x27;s not rocket science. However, fixing this would require the VS source code and MSFT to accept a patch.<p>Using Visual Studio, gui or command line, uses the MSBuild engine though the VS wrapping does some internal caching that occasionally makes it wrong (ah! There&#x27;s a cryptic flag that fixes this).",1426751527

I like the idea, but if you add such a clause to your software&#x27;s license, then your software won&#x27;t be able to be included in other software that has the same license as your&#x27;s unless they <i>also</i> amend their license (Which may be impossible to do).<p>IE. If you license your code, project A, with &#x27;GPLv3 + no-stupid-software&#x27;, and project B wants to use your code but they&#x27;re licensed as &#x27;GPLv3&#x27;, legally they can&#x27;t because the licenses are incompatible. Project B would have to amend their license to add the &#x27;no-stupid-software&#x27; clause to make it compatible with project A (But of course doing that may introduce other license incompatibilities with other pieces of software, and projects with a decent number of contributors probably don&#x27;t have much of an option to change license at this point).<p>I don&#x27;t know if there would be any incompatibilities going the other direction: You want to use project B in your software, and project B has the license &#x27;GPLv3&#x27; but your software has the license &#x27;GPLv3 + no-stupid-software&#x27;. I <i>think</i> that should be ok, assuming that clause doesn&#x27;t conflict with anything already in the GPL, but again, IANAL.",1426750193

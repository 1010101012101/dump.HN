Yahoo Mail supports OAuth, but that&#x27;s not worth a damn if sites don&#x27;t explicitly integrate with Yahoo and provide a &quot;Sign in with Yahoo&quot; button.<p><i>That&#x27;s</i> why we need email-based authentication. Because, in practice, sites are going to integrate with Gmail and Facebook and call it a day.<p>(On the flipside, there&#x27;s a great opportunity for Passwordless to offer optional, transparent integration with major OAuth providers, while falling back to an email loop for everyone else so people don&#x27;t get locked out. That&#x27;s what we did for Persona, and it mostly worked wonderfully.)",1445572750

The biggest problem is that there isn&#x27;t really any real implementations for it, the spec is still a working draft, and it hasn&#x27;t evolved much past defining schemas and doing basic queries.<p>I find what they have defined so far far more approachable than Cypher or Gremlin. As they have been adding features it is starting to sprawl and look just as nutty as the others.

10436700,comment,10435159,10435159,0,0,shostack,,,"><i>“At the time, we blindly tried all the stuff everybody says is supposed to work: AdWords, billboards, social, content and more. And we were pretty stressed out about it. We assumed everybody had this dialed in, and we were just idiots. I had some very difficult conversations with our early marketing hires, basically holding them to what I now know is an impossibly objective standard.”</i><p>As someone who has been doing digital marketing for a long time and is intimately familiar with the pitfalls and &quot;known unknowns&quot; I have to agree pretty strongly with this.<p>Back when last-touch/click attribution was about as good as it got in digital, life was easy, but it was because we were blind to what was really happening from a data standpoint.<p>Now we have fancy attribution tools and OH MY GOD IS IT HORRENDOUSLY FUZZY.  Some actions are relatively straightforward to measure performance of from a last-touch standpoint and those are the easy ones to deal with.  For anything with a sales process requiring multiple touch points, you&#x27;re in the fuzzy world of attribution.<p>We&#x27;re getting a lot better at it, but I&#x27;d argue it is the holy grail of marketing questions to know &quot;what value did X contribute to this goal?&quot; which is otherwise known as &quot;I know I&#x27;m wasting half my marketing budget, but I don&#x27;t know which half.&quot; I&#x27;ve seen some pretty fancy econometric modelling tools, and Google has done a huge thing for the entire industry by making their core attribution and multi-channel tools available for free, but it is still maddeningly difficult to answer a question such as &quot;what value is our display campaign driving?&quot; or &quot;what is a view-through conversion worth to us?&quot;<p>To get lost in the minutiae is easy given the massive amount of new data available.  You then end up with paralysis by analysis.  Ultimately there&#x27;s still some aspects of marketing you need to use your &quot;marketer&#x27;s gut&quot; in deciding--and this is coming from someone who is a huge data nerd and loves seeing instances where data runs counter to intuition.<p>I&#x27;m personally dying to see what Facebook does with Atlas here as they have a very vested interest in proving the value of display given that Facebook and FBX inventory is often found to be more of a &quot;first-touch&quot; awareness driver vs. a last-touch &quot;closer&quot; and thus often gets lumped in as a poor performer for those who aren&#x27;t looking at attribution, yet are measuring several channels together under a last-touch model.<p>That&#x27;s why I often tell people that we can look at the data through a variety of lenses, but they are ultimately all directional.  So picking an attribution model and consistently making decisions based on it is important.  But knowing when to carve out budget to do something that may go against the model is equally important.  Case in point, I&#x27;ve dealt with a scenario where I didn&#x27;t have great cross-device tracking in place, but knew that mobile was an important touch point from an initial engagement standpoint based on some data I had.  I couldn&#x27;t initially prove the link, but I know it is there because I&#x27;ve seen all of the surrounding signs (kind of like how you tell where a black hole is by looking at the signs around where it should be).  This is a &quot;known unknown&quot; to some extent, and measuring it precisely, while possible, is not always easy.  The resulting lift from pushing mobile was validation, although perhaps not as directly measurable as I would have liked.<p>The best advice I can give to anyone dealing with marketing on this, particularly those with low-volume B2B situations with long sales cycles and many touch points is this:<p>Get comfortable with fuzzy data since if you follow old-school approaches such as &quot;strict last click&quot; you are going to miss out on major opportunities that more savvy and flexible competitors will eat your lunch over.",1445572274

Advocacy, education, grants, etc. They also own the for-profit Mozilla Corporation, which is in trenches directly competing with other browser vendors to ensure that the project has sufficient influence to fulfill its mission.<p>Persona was housed in MoCo, which afforded it greater resources at the cost of greater organizational risk.<p>> <i>Either Mozilla is full of it when they say they fight for the free web, or they massively misunderstand how important it is to get rid of proprietary authentication.</i><p>The Mozilla project is too small to fight effectively on every front; we have to focus on areas of greatest urgency and where we have the greatest leverage. In the instance of Persona, two major things changed: (1) Persona became less urgent, and (2) we discovered that we couldn&#x27;t credibly leverage Firefox to boost Persona adoption.<p>To the first point, back in 2012 we were seeing <i>huge</i> startups, including Spotify and Pinterest, run without offering any means of authentication besides Facebook Connect. The lack of traditional authentication on these sites looked like an ill omen for the freedom of the future Web, but that didn&#x27;t come to pass. Both sites now offer email-based authentication in addition to Facebook Connect. It&#x27;s not as slick as it would have been with Persona, but the immediate threat to user autonomy isn&#x27;t there anymore. If I had to guess, it seems like the tide started turning in late 2012 / early 2013, around the time of Mailchimp&#x27;s &quot;Social Login Buttons Aren&#x27;t Worth It&quot; blog post at <a href=""http://blog.mailchimp.com/social-login-buttons-arent-worth-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mailchimp.com/social-login-buttons-arent-worth-i...</a>.<p>Secondly, Persona&#x27;s passwordless design wasn&#x27;t suitable for use in Firefox Accounts, the development of which had become quite urgent. So not only could we not use Firefox Sync / Accounts to boost Persona&#x27;s active userbase, the Persona team suddenly found itself with domain knowledge that was quite valuable to the Accounts and Sync efforts. Oops. :)<p>That said, just because we&#x27;re not fighting as visibly on this front doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re out of the fight altogether. Firefox Accounts has an active userbase orders of magnitude larger than Persona&#x27;s. We may be able to reintroduce a notion of federated identity into FxA at some point in the future, which would help us break out of the &quot;three-way cold start&quot; that Persona faced.<p>But that&#x27;s all hypothetical. If anyone wants to run with these ideas, <i>do it!</i> For the sake of longevity, I&#x27;d recommend any spiritual successors to either establish themselves within independent foundations, or design the protocol without the sort of centralized bootstrapping that Persona had.",1445572066

If I&#x27;m sitting waiting for a login token to get to my emails and it&#x27;s not Right There, I&#x27;m walking.<p>I don&#x27;t see passwordless fixing anything new that OAuth doesn&#x27;t fix.

10436593,comment,10435984,10435984,0,0,pmalynin,,,"Where to even begin,<p>Part of this issue I feel is, as mentioned in the article, is that boys are taught from the young age to take care of their problems, which leads to more isolation. Another important reason I feel is the rising amount of &quot;girls-only&quot; opportunities that systematically make boys feel inadequate and since they are not able to participate for whatever reason (e.g. &quot;its only for girls&quot;) they continue to lag behind. I even have a perfect example of this, my city has a &quot;Girls Learning Code&quot; meetup / lecture series that while advertises being gender neutral is clearly not so, the question is how many meetups are there that are for boys, e.g. &quot;Boys Learning Code&quot; (creating these would be classified under men &#x27;s rights activism and therefore dismissed). My point is (or rather society&#x27;s) is that if you&#x27;re male and have a good start then you&#x27;re automatically golden, but for those that do not have the same starting opportunities there are simply no other options that are, on the other hand, available to girls from all backgrounds. There has also been a decline in male bonding occurring at the young age, which I (and some academics) believe is very important to male development over all. This is caused by the fact that traditionally boys-only facilities (in this specific example Scouts Canada) have been pressured into accepting girls, which prohibits boys from...essentially being boys. Girl Guides of Canada received no such pressure. Coming back to the issue of masculinity, even though many young adults might have good enough grades to get into university they might not be high enough to go into fields that wouldn&#x27;t cause strange questions and don&#x27;t have stigma around them if you&#x27;re male (I&#x27;m talking about fields such as Medicine, Law, Engineering, Computer Science), they might have the grades to get into Arts, specifically psychology, nursing and things such as women studies, all of which have a very high female to male ratio (and are generally considered a &quot;girls&quot; field) making boys pursue other interests (such as not going to university) instead for the fears of unsexing themselves.<p>(Whats the deal with gender issues anyway in North America? I&#x27;ve immigrated from an Eastern-Block country as a teenager to NA and I&#x27;ve never seen these problems because communism required that all members of the society do essentially the same jobs, that is why would you sacrifice half of the working populace, so you have women in high power positions, police, factories, the military, a lot of girls even take mathematics and computational sciences, sure there were problems but not at this scale (my grandmother was a Chemist and my mother was a corporal in the Defense Ministry and also studied thermal physics in University); I&#x27;ve never even imagined it was an issue elsewhere in the world until after I moved to Canada)",1445569934

1661130,comment,1659277,1660076,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"More correctly, this is how to send a message using commutative ciphers without ever exposing <i>any</i> keys - public or private.<p>This is the problem with analogies such as these.  They can sort of be nearly right, and sort of give the right idea, but at the same time actually be quite misleading in the detail.<p>Here's what's actually equivalent to the analogy.  We openly agree a large prime N (this is equivalent to agreeing on a style of box to use).  I select a random number A (the padlock) and compute its multiplicative inverse A' (mod N) (the key).  You do the same to compute B and B'.<p>I want to send you a message M.  I compute W=M^A (mod N) [I put the message in the box and lock it with the padlock] and send that to you.  You compute X=W^B (mod N) [you put your padlock on it] and send it back.<p>Now I compute Y=X^A' (mod N) [unlock with the key]  and send you that, and finally you unlock with B' by taking Z=Y^B' (mod N).<p>We compute Z=Y^B'=(X^A')^B'=((W^B)^A')^B'=(((M^A)^B)^A')^B' but that's equal to M^(A.A'.B.B') which turns out to equal M.  On the way any evesdropper will know M^A, M^(A.B) and M^B, but it is computationally infeasible (if P!=NP) currently to compute M, A or B from these.<p>The obvious method of attack is to use M^A and M^(AB) to try to deduce B and hence compute B', but that's equivalent (probably) to the discrete log problem ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm</a> ) which is thought to be pretty similar to factoring integers.<p>Both RSA and Diffie-Hellman-Merkle-Williamson key exchange need different analogies.  RSA usually uses the analogy that I give people open padlocks, and they use them to send me locked boxes.  I can open them because I have the key.<p>I don't know a good analogy for the DHMW key exchange.  It works like this.  We agree a large prime N and a suitable base b.  I choose a random A, compute X=b^A and send X to you.  You choose a random B, compute Y=b^B and send that to me.  I compute Y^A, you compute X^B, and we both end up with K, a shared secret which we can use in a symmetric cipher.<p>I now await the really clever people to correct my errors.",1283547308

It might be somewhat more conservative than apt-get's autoremove, though I'm not sure exactly how apt-get's version works. Aptitude sort of opts-in packages to autoremoval: when <i>aptitude itself</i> automatically installs a package to satisfy a dependency, it remembers that fact, and <i>only</i> considers those packages for auto-uninstallation. So the only possible way a package will get auto-removed is if it was a package that aptitude auto-installed to begin with, and none of the reasons for the auto-installation hold anymore. Any package that got on the system some other way, such as being part of the base install from an ISO, doesn't get considered, even if nothing depends on it.",1283547096

I've recently started selling some small routers with my software installed, but loading each one individually takes some time -- about 10 minutes each.  This 10+ year old system runs a customized version of Knoppix, which can be used to install my software onto a large number of routers simultaneously.  It means I can flash as many routers as I want within 10 minutes, instead of having to wait for 10 minutes each.  This multiplex install system has some other components as well, but this PC sits at the center of it.<p>It's far more convenient to have a separate PC (especially one with a monitor) for this, since that way I don't have to keep disconnecting/reconnecting the necessary ethernet cords.  Also, it only draws power during the brief time it's turned on (when I'm actually doing an install), so the fact it has an inefficient power supply isn't really a problem.

1660914,comment,1658022,1658289,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I had thought so too, but it's not as simple as the Wikipedia page makes it seem. The report does consider the possibility that the red 'dye' came from a meteorite which is thought to have entered the atmosphere and exploded, but rejected this idea because it was found to be biological (as opposed to mineral). At the time of this report, nobody had suggested any exobiological explanation, so none was considered or refuted. I would be wary of relying so completely on it for a few reasons.<p>First, the identification of the biological material as an  alga of the genus <i>Trentopohlia</i> (which one?) was only visual in nature, and not confirmed by spectroscopic or other methods. Second, the material reproduced poorly, if at all, in growth media - except for a corn-based growth medium which had been incubated for over an hour at 60 degrees C (I presume before the introduction of the sample, their wording is a little vague).  Lichens normally prefer a cool humid atmosphere; it seems <i>Trentepohlia</i> algae are particularly difficult to grow in culture, and I couldn't find any evidence of corn being the organism's preferred snack. There's no references so I'm not sure if this result is meant to be significant or not.<p>Third, while the report noted the widespread presence of suitable lichens in the area and hypothesized a widespread release of spores into the air as the source of the red coloring, in the 'further studies' section following the conclusion they note that this explanation depends on phenomena that are 'quite improbable' (mass synchronous spore release in lichens is not known or thought to occur) to 'not possible': strong vertical updrafts (ie thermals) would be required to lift spores up into the atmosphere; the red rains were observed to take place in the morning, but thermals do not occur at night; rains during the preceding night and early morning were normal and should have washed out any spores which had climbed into the atmosphere the previous day.

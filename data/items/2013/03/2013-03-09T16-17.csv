5348889,comment,5348028,5348028,6,0,graycat,,,"For ""dark corners of C"", when I was writing C code I
had several serious concerns.  Below I list eight
such in roughly descending order on 'seriousness':<p>First, what are malloc() and free() doing?  That is,
what are the details, all the details and exactly
how they work?<p>It was easy enough to read K&R, see how malloc() and
free() were supposed to be used, and to use them,
but even if they worked perfectly I was unsure of
the correctness of my code, especially in
challenging situations, expected problems with
'memory management' very difficult to debug, and
wanted a lot of help on memory management.  I would
have written my own 'help' for memory management if
I had known what C's memory management was actually
doing.<p>'Help' for memory management?  Sure:  Put in a lot
of checking and be able to get out a report on what
was allocated, when, by what part of the code, maybe
keep reference counters, etc. to provide some checks
to detect problems and some hints to help in
debugging.<p>That I didn't know the details was a bummer.<p>It was irritating that K&R, etc. kept saying that
malloc() allocated space in the 'heap' without
saying just what they meant by a 'heap' and which I
doubt was a 'heap' as in heap sort.<p>Second, the 'stack' and 'stack overflow' were always
looming as a threat of disaster, difficult to see
coming, and to be protected against only by mud
wrestling with obscure commands to the linkage
editor or whatever.  So, I had no way to estimate
stack size when writing code or to track it during
execution.<p>Third, doing data conversions with a 'cast' commonly
sent me into outrage orbiting Jupiter.<p>Why?  Data conversion is very important, but a
'cast' never meant anything.  K&R just kept saying
'cast' as if they were saying something meaningful,
but they never were.  In the end 'cast' was just
telling the type checking of the compiler that,
""Yes, I know, I'm asking for a type conversion, so
get me a special dispensation from the type checking
police."".<p>What was missing were the details, for each case, on
just how the conversion would be done.  In strong
contrast, when I was working with PL/I, the
documentation went to great lengths to be clear on
the details of conversion for each case of
conversion.  I knew when I was doing a conversion
and didn't need the 'discipline' of type checking in
the compiler to make me aware of where I was doing a
conversion.<p>Why did I want to know the details of how the
conversions were done?  So that I could 'desk check'
my code and be more sure that some 'boundary case'
in the middle of the night two years in the future
wouldn't end up with a divide by zero, a square
root of a negative number, or some such.<p>So, too often I wrote some test code to be clear on
just what some of the conversions actually did.<p>Fourth, that the strings were terminated by the
character null usually sent me into outrage and
orbit around Pluto.  Actually I saw that null
terminated strings were so hopeless as a good tool
that I made sure I never counted on the null
character being there (except maybe when reading the
command line).  So, I ended up manipulating strings
without counting on the character null.<p>Why?  Because commonly the data I was manipulating
as strings could contain any bytes at all, e.g., the
data could be from graphics, audio, some of the
contents of main memory, machine language
instructions, output of data logging, say, sonar
data recorded on a submarine at sea, etc.  And, no
matter what the data was, no way did I want the
string manipulation software to get a tummy ache
just from finding a null.<p>Fifth, knowing so little about the details of memory
management, the stack, and exceptional condition
handling, I was very reluctant to consider trying to
make threading work.<p>Sixth, arrays were a constant frustration.  The
worst part was that could write a subroutine to,
say, invert a 10 x 10 matrix but then couldn't use
it to invert a 20 x 20 matrix.  Why?  Because inside
the subroutine, the 'extents' of the dimensions of
the matrix had to be given as just integer constants
and, thus, could not be discovered by the subroutine
after it was called.  So, basically in the
subroutine I had to do my own array indexing
arithmetic starting with data on the size of the
matrix passed via the argument list.  Writing my own
code for the array indexing was likely significantly
slower during execution than in, say, Fortran or
PL/I, where the compiler writer knows when they are
doing array indexing and can take advantage of that
fact.<p>So, yes, no doubt as tens of thousands of other C
programmers, I wrote a collection of matrix
manipulation routines, and for each matrix used a C
struct to carry the data describing the matrix that
PL/I carried in what the IBM PL/I execution logic
manual called a 'dope vector'.  The difference was,
both PL/I and C programmers pass dope vectors, but
the C programmers have to work out the dope vector
logic for themselves.  With a well written compiler,
the approach of PL/I or Fortran should be faster.<p>It did occur to me that maybe other similar uses of
the C struct 'data type' were the inspiration for
Stroustrup's C++.  For more, originally C++ was just
a preprocessor to C, and at that time and place,
Bell Labs, with Ratfor, preprocessors were popular.
Actually writing a compiler would have permitted a
nicer language.<p>Seventh, PL/I was in really good shape some years
before C was started and had subsets that were much
better than C and not much more difficult to
compile, etc.  E.g., PL/I arrays and structures are
really nice, much better than C, and mostly are
surprisingly easy to implement and efficient at
execution.  Indeed, PL/I structures are so nice that
they are in practice nearly as powerful as objects
and often easier and more intuitive to use.  What
PL/I did with scope of names is also super nice to
have and would have helped C a lot.<p>Eight, the syntax of C, especially for pointers, was
'idiosyncratic' and obscure.  The semantics in PL/I
were more powerful, but the syntax was much easier
to read and write.  There is no good excuse for the
obscure parts of C syntax.<p>For a software 'platform' for my startup, I selected
Windows instead of some flavor of Unix.  There I
wanted to build on the 'common language runtime'
(CLR) and the .NET Framework.  So, for languages, I
could select from C#, Visual Basic .NET, F#, etc.<p>I selected Visual Basic .NET and generally have been
pleased with it.  The syntax and memory management
are very nice; .NET is enormous; some of what is
there, e.g., for 'reflection', class instance
serialization, and some of what ASP.NET does with
Visual Basic .NET, is amazing.  In places Visual
Basic borrows too much from C and would have done
better borrowing from PL/I.",1362848375

The unique properties of the tablet format can't really be taken advantage of with those apps. I do have an issue with the way files are handled, though, but I think it's minor and will be addressed over time. For instance the ""horizontal scrolling list of gigantic previews of documents"" just doesn't scale to anything a professional can deal with. And the document syncing is all over the map - Omni told me they won't/can't support Dropbox, etc.<p>But again, I feel that is a relatively minor point compared to the bigger issue of using the tablet format to its potential.

There may be some back and forth on this, since regular users (not just admins) will want to work with the number prescribed above.<p>Then, you need to draw up a quick prototype. We don't need any crap like <i>UNITY_VALUE</i> polluting our beautiful agile code. Instead we'll declare a constant called <i>ONE</i> somewhere.

I throughout my life thought many ailments were my ""problem"", ranging from simple depression, bipolar, alcoholism, drug dependancy and tried the methods successful for each one to ""cure me"" to no avail.<p>A couple of years ago however a psychologist gave me his opinion of ADD.  Just simply knowing what it was has helped me enormously.  It gave me a set of tools to fight the issue.  It turns out that all of those other things were epiphenomena of the ADD, parts of the vicious cycle of the upswing when you start seeing the light, elation with a new achieved high you get from some measure of success, followed by the eventual downfall and depression when you see that you are still not making headway.  This cycle would repeat and still affects me a bit.<p>In my case what helped was a stricter regiment of food supplements (especially D, Omega, B6, B12 and calcium) and using Mountain Dew (yes, I know it's a horrid substance) to elevate myself in the afternoon.  This coupled with Mindfulness meditation allows me to stay relatively productive.  I'm in the process of getting medication for ADD after reading Flower for Algernon and realizing that refusing medication is akin to Charlie refusing the operation (read the book if you haven't, it's remarkably well written).<p>Before this realization and change in behavior I was flunking out of CompSci @ University.  After that change I managed a whole year of full coursework and graduation.  I managed to get a job and am managing to achieve the goals we (me and my boss) set for my work.<p>My point is:  You might think you have a specific problem but in reality you might have another problem, but the symptom is what you notice.  ADD should really have been obvious when you look @ my life a certain way (having studied everything from medicine to economics to accounting to philosophy and finally CompSci).  I had seen many professionals and only one of them hit the proper diagnosis.  The funny thing was once I knew the problem, I had tons of tools I had learned about elsewhere to combat it and the only reason I think he was right is that the methods worked!<p>One of the things that keep me focused is helping others.  It kinda gives me a good reason to maintain myself in fit spiritual condition (agnostic, spiritual here simply means connected with my fellow man).  A friend of mine is graduating this spring and he tells me he wouldn't be, if I weren't helping him with his maths.  Once he graduates, I need to find someone else to help.  It gives me strength to know that the help I received, I can pay forward.  I'm glad far_far_away is doing that too.",1362847160

Each day, find someone you can ""help"" ... hold the door for someone with full arms, smile at someone who's scowling or tutor someone who's having a hard time understanding something you know well.<p>You'll certainly brighten their day, but you'll also find the satisfaction in being helpful (with no expectation of any compensation) will improve your mood too.  Don't believe me?  Try it for 30 days ... and if at some point you believe your life isn't worth living right now, think of what the people you've helped would say about your life.",1362844993

Here is the video with english subtitles:<p><a href=""http://reporter.kro.nl/seizoenen/2012/afleveringen/28-12-2012/extras/mayday_mayday_-_international_version"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reporter.kro.nl/seizoenen/2012/afleveringen/28-12-201...</a><p>While this hasn't lead to an accident yet, it has lead to several mayday calls when planes had to fly to another airport due to weather conditions or had to wait in the air because the airport was busy. The airport had to let Ryanair land before its turn. If the other firms that had aircraft landing at the airport had been flying with similarly low fuel it would have been a crash.<p>and part 2:<p><a href=""http://reporter.kro.nl/seizoenen/2013/afleveringen/03-01-2013/extras/mayday_mayday_part_2_-_english_version"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reporter.kro.nl/seizoenen/2013/afleveringen/03-01-201...</a><p>This part is partially about the fuel issue but also about other issues, such as pilots being pressured to fly while ill or very tired.",1362844891

If you're not a pragmatist, always trying new things but always looking at results with a cold eye, you're truly lost in this business.<p>Good article, but the jury is still out here. Right now this is more of a sales pitch than a story. In about three years, I'd love to come back to these guys and see how it's going.<p>One of the problems with any organization is that people like doing what they like to do, not necessarily the things that need to be done. There are things we are really good at  -- programming, artwork, group encounters, whatever -- and we tend to gravitate towards situations that let us do these things. The immediate danger of an organization without a tight feedback loop is that people drift into doing their own things and other important stuff doesn't get done.<p>But that's just the theory. The important thing is how it works in this situation, for these guys. Hopefully there will be an update a few years down the road.",1362844837

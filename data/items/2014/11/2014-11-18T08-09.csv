As @lastofus points out communication and management effort eats into the potential gains.<p>If you are really serious about leverage then look at MBSE/MDD/MDE/DSL technologies.  That is, tools that will take formal specifications and generate code.  The old 80:20 rule applies here too, as much as 80% of the code can be generated automatically, the rest by either yourself or the very well paid sufficiently smart programmer(s).",1416301079

I think there&#x27;s a tendency to assume that it&#x27;s incredibly easy - that any snapshot will look amazing simply because it&#x27;s space.  In reality there are plenty of situations where practicality wins over aesthetics and extremely high dynamic range will cause problems.

What Lua has done with tables and modules is pretty elegant and I can see more of the highlights of the Oberon family in Lua than I do Go.<p>The few Oberon-like aspects I see in Go beyond the obvious &#x27;:=&#x27; operator are things like the &#x27;range&#x27; keyword and methods. Both Oberon and Standard ML encourage composition a bit differently when it comes to functions and modules. You&#x27;re lead to using more locally-defined functions in the context of writing a function. Modules are more at the forefront, with less hesitancy to define  simple ones. Go I think more resembles an attempt to make a scripting language out of Plan 9&#x27;s C and threading with a few odd-and-ends. I do very much like that it avoided objects.<p>However, I think even Modula-3 which appeared by the end of the late 80s already had things that Go right now is lacking. That said, I&#x27;ve used Go for some production projects. Some projects fit neatly into Go&#x27;s standard library, which is the star of the language along with its ideas on tooling. The language itself I could take or leave.",1416299254

1) recognize Java types that can be promoted to struct-types. GWT already knows how to do this as it has passes to convert all methods of a class to monomorphic/static dispatch, meaning the prototype only has to contain field values. Thus if a Java type has no polymorphic methods, and all fields are either primitives, or references to other &#x27;struct&#x27; types, then the compiler can emit typed objects.<p>2) Since Java is a GC&#x27;ed language, GWT currently isn&#x27;t in the business of implementing a memory management scheme. We rely on Javascript to do this. The current problem with strict asmjs output is we&#x27;d need to allocate typed arrays and our own memory management scheme. There&#x27;s not much appetite for that right now, but I suppose it could change in the future.",1416297853

I had a 68020 CPU, but due to no MMU and no FPU (neither being &quot;normal&quot; accessories at the time) I just couldn&#x27;t get the thing to boot at all. Later, when I acquired a 68030 CPU, I at least had the MMU covered, but I was still a kid and didn&#x27;t have a budget for a FPU. So I still couldn&#x27;t get things booting.<p>Granted, back then I wouldn&#x27;t know my way around Unix if I had been handed a booting system, but I was curious about this &quot;Linux&quot; thing which was supposed to be superior if you wanted to run BBSes, multitask and do stuff like that.<p>But despite all those resources I had, I couldn&#x27;t get things going. And here this guy gets Linux running on a home-built 68008-based system of all things.<p>That is seriously cool!<p>Edit: I may be mixing up my 68k models. I also had a plain 68000 earlier, which was definitely not up for the task. If I&#x27;m mixing things up, please forgive me. It was a long time ago :)",1416297667

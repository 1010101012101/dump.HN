3331983,comment,3331518,3331942,6,0,brc,,,"* Australian banks are more heavily regulated and haven't lent 'sub-prime' mortgages.<p>This is completely untrue.  The extent of sub-prime mortgages isn't the same, but it exists nonetheless.  As does the existence of RBMS, which the government continues to purchase from the banks.<p>All of that looks over the fact that the big 4 banks in Australia are massively overexposed to residential mortgages and small business loans underpinned by residential property.  In some ways it's worse than the USA because the mortgages are still on the books rather than being sold off into the secondary market.<p>The differences between the Irish housing bubble and the Australian housing bubble are actually much less.  So you're right to say that there the parallells between the USA and Australia are less, but the parallells between Ireland and Australia are few.  Ireland has full-recourse mortgages like Australia.  Ireland had a massive overinvestment in property, like Australia.  Ireland had high immigration, like Australia.<p>As I've said elsewhere in this thread, I don't think there is ever a time when you take your eyes off the negative.",1323392377

3331963,comment,3331518,3331851,4,0,brc,,,"I don't particularly want to get into a point scoring match because clearly we are looking at things from different sides of the political aisle, as it were.<p>However, to clarify the point : the government debt is low by world standards, but growing fast, and that is while the economy is at a cyclical high.   What I am trying to say here is that : current government debt spending is unsustainable and unwise.  The comparison with Ireland is to show this : there is never a good time to start growing your government debt, particularly when your economy is being underpinned by excessively high property prices and diversion of resources into the property industry.  What, precisely, would the Australian government do if the banks were all caught short because they are overexposed to the overleveraged and overvalued property market? Why, of course they would be considered 'too big to fail' and public funds would be used to bail them out.  And Australians would suffer from the same transfer of private debt to public sector debt to shore up the balance sheets of the big four banks who have massive holdings of residential mortgages. If anyone thinks it can't happen here, I'd be very interested in why not.<p>My overall thesis is that, yes, Australia is doing well, but that is precisely the time to tighten up and do better, rather than give a collective pat on the back and say, 'well the hard work has been done, let's all borrow a heap of money and give ourselves a reward'.<p>In other words, yes, on a Friday afternoon, crack a coldie and enjoy a quick survey of things.  Back on Monday morning continue the hard work of difficult economic reforms and tightening the fiscal belt and getting productivity higher.  Those difficult economic reforms are more deregulation of the labor market, removal of red tape surrounding industry, find out how more international investment can be attracted.  Work out how productivity and foreign investment can be increased.  The hard work never stops and it's never time to get complacent.",1323392046

3331959,comment,3331556,3331934,0,0,saurik,,,"I am curious if you've ever actually called PayPal. I have received nothing but high quality support from them. You can call them throughout most of the working day (until 8pm PST, I believe), and they seem to have somewhat knowledgable engineers available at that tech tier. They also have a merchant technical support site that seemingly no one knows about where you can often get answers in the middle of the night (I often get responses back at 12:30). If you are even reasonably sized you can also ask for a dedicated account manager: I have the cell phone number of someone at PayPal whose job it is to find me answers to problems I have.<p>Though, I cannot say PayPal is perfect. I have run into a bunch of annoying issues correlating settlements (bugs filed recently, will be curious to see if they get fixed), and their pricing is not the best that is out there (although is still better than Stripe). I am curious if you've looked into any alternatives. I've spent the last few days talking to Litle & Co, and I must say that the people there /love/ talking to you about payments... their booth at ad:tech was the most enjoyable conversation I've had about payments in a while, and I got to spend another half hour on the phone with them yesterday learning more about how bank ACH settlement works.<p><i>Edit to reflect your edit ;P</i><p>That is the page I just had gone and reviewed now. It still seems incredibly manual. I would not feel comfortable running a site at scale where I'm dealing with receiving e-mails in an undocumented (probably designed-for-humans) format as my only source of notifications for chargebacks. :(<p>It is often these ""at scale"" issues that are seemingly not handled by them; example: per their API page, Stripe does not resend webhooks if there is an error in the response... doesn't this make them useless to rely on?

In reality, some would and some wouldn't do what you suggest. If all of them did exactly what you are suggesting ( some sort of extreme rational agent), the distribution wouldn't be exponential. But then, all human beings don't buy low & sell high, nor do all of us withdraw money from the same ATM at the same time, nor do we make phone calls at the same time, or hit the internet at the same time. Aggregate behavior distributions modelling aggregate behavior of individual humans work well except in very extreme conditions such as 911 when everybody does indeed make the phone call at the same time thus jamming up the airwaves and killing the shape of the nice Erlang distribution at the telephone exchange.",1323392013

I'm certain people got amazing customer support from people high up at PayPal when it was just starting. You cannot judge a company on whether a co-founder responds to you on Twitter in a short period of time, and if you did, you should probably judge it negatively: I would wonder what was wrong with PayPal if someone that high up had enough time to be sitting around checking Twitter.<p>(edit: I typed this over too long a period of time, and some of this post appeared after I had already submitted a draft with the above paragraph that received some upvotes, so I've now edited again to add this edit paragraph to explain that everything after this point was added after I received said upvotes. ;P)<p>Also, I'm very curious about their API... I didn't see much information on chargebacks. Processors like Litle & Co make it very easy to fully automate the chargeback representment flow. PayPal, incidentally, does /not/ provide this either, but they do have APIs that let you (with only some hoops to get through bugs that I've filed with them, and we may see fixed fairly soon) correlate and track all of the chargebacks and how they relate to your transactions.<p>Yet, when Stripe first started appearing on Hacker News, their website seemed to have almost no information on chargebacks. I asked after this, and the page ""appeared"" with an apology that it was supposedly there but not linked, but it then had very little information on it. I still (checking again now) see no information on how I'd determine /which/ transactions had chargebacks automatically: they seem to seriously rely on sending an e-mail?

The other reason for initial attraction was of course their elegant API, which was very refreshing to see after having dealt with Intuit's QBMS API (<i>shudder</i>) in the past.<p>Stripe really sealed the deal though when I tweeted them to ask my first question about signup and one of the co-founders reached out to me. Since then, I've been in contact to share my feedback or ask other questions, and the quality and timing of their responses is one of the best I've ever seen.<p>When a customer of ours had an issue placing his order, I wrote Stripe to see if they could offer any insight as to what errors they might be seeing on their end. While the error was unrelated to Stripe itself, they were so awesome that they actually took the initiative to browse through our checkout page and point out the spot that they thought to be the issue.<p>A company that stands beside you when debugging your checkout page, maintaining swift response times on an issue that isn't even theirs? <i>That's</i> customer support.<p>I probably sound like I'm gushing right now, but I just have mad respect for this company.

To describe that particular specimen as ""missing"" is accurate, but it's a rather melodramatic adjective - it's not like we need that one specific specimen in order to discover anything about our relationship to chimps (or whatever else).<p>So really, ""missing link"" is just a headline-grabbing way of saying ""common ancestor that we haven't dug up yet (and probably never will because fossils are extremely rare)"".<p>Regardless, Ardi does not ""disprove"" a missing link in any way, shape, or form.  Ardi does not invalidate the theory that there <i>is</i> a common ancestor between us and chimps; she merely shows that it probably doesn't look like we think it does.

855906,comment,855557,855557,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"Very cool idea and concept.  However, I'm not convinced of the utility of rating a movie compared to it's trailer.  If the movie has a shitty trailer, but is actually an OK movie, it will get high ratings.  If it has a great trailer, and is a great movie, it will get average ratings.  Why should I care about the ""quality of trailer"" to ""quality of movie"" ratio?  What's the advantage over a rotten tomatoes rating, for example?<p>What I think stands out the most is the super easy access to the trailers.  I would come to your site just to see what movies are coming out and watch the trailers.  The other sites that offer trailers, at the moment, are barely worth going to because of how much spam they have everywhere.<p>As far as my first impression:  I was confused at first, until I saw the top tagline.  The google text ads at the top were very disorienting.  It looks like navigation, and immediately causes me to question the legitimacy of the website.  I basically ignored the slideshow thing, I'm not sure why.<p>Scrolling down I notice names of movies coming out.  Ok, and so what?  Further down I see ratings.  Ok, I get it.  I think you should put popular movies with ratings first.  (Perhaps take the top 10 grossing movies, and only use those that are at least a week old... odds are everyone has heard of these)  Just seeing a movie name with a screenshot was confusing at first.<p>When I watched a trailer I was pleased at the trailer quality and speed at which it started.  Now, where do I vote?  I have no idea.  I can become a fan or follow you on Twitter, but where the hell do I vote?  Do I have to sign up?  There's no login anywhere...  Eventually, after two or three trailers, I read that text that said I need to login with FB or Twitter to vote.  You should make that text stand out, for sure.  I just assumed that it was the standard ""share on Facebook and Twitter"" thing that I see elsewhere.<p>Finally, were I to commit to your site and actually want to browse around (which I have), I would expect more content and more means to sort it.  What are the highest/lowest/most voted movies?  That definitely needs to be there.<p>That's all for now... sorry about the disorganization in my post.  Best of luck.",1254433660

Nice.<p>Still, the reason ""Software System Architecture"" or anything with the architecture name on it, has become a dirty word is because there is no understanding between an abstraction and a concrete thing. What you picture is known as Intellectual Violence, an architectural antipattern. In my case, if I want to talk about data, I say data. If I want to talk about information, I say information. They are not the same thing. SO, if I say resource, it means it is not data nor service. A resource can be a document, data, a service, a process, a whole system, anything.<p>So, as you can see, that is no mental circle, I really mean anything. If you think a resource is just data exposed as a service, then you are missing thousands of other resource implementations. Why call it resource and not data, service or system? Because resource is an abstraction, that allows me to work it without knowing what the final implementation would be.<p>Cheers!",1254432735

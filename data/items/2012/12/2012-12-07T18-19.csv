That's why most recipes come with specific amounts or weights of ingredients to add, because we need a common terminology to correctly express the recipe.<p>Taken totally as an argument for teaching or explaining statistics, I see your point.

Would you say that women have a right to speak about their feelings on this topic, explain why they feel the way that they feel, or even just vent about how bothered they get by those situations?<p>Rebecca Watson didn't get anybody ""thrown out"" of the World Atheist Convention, she discussed an incident that happened there, and some people got really bothered that she considered it an incident. It was a complete flustercuck, not because talking to a woman on an elevator is HORRIBLE RAMPANT MISOGYNY, but because there are reasons why Watson found the gesture creepy, and there were many man  from your post, you included  who simply refused to admit that Watson had any legitimate point whatsoever.<p>Which is why, by the way, these codes of conduct are necessary. It's not necessarily that <i>you</i> would do something horribly wrong or alienating or offensive, but if something as simple as ""being hit on at 4am by a strange man"" is still sneered at as a legitimate concern, then probably some people think they're entitled to far grosser and more outlandish actions as well. And that means that either women might be actively harassed (possibly even assaulted), or they'll feel like they're not actually a part of the group, and then they'll leave, and the community will be immeasurably diminished for their leaving.<p>Again, the downvoters were wrong to knock you down  your opinion was relevant to the discussion and stated concisely  but your attitude here is exactly the problem which codes of conduct will attempt to enforce.

Instead, you start with certain goals and try to implement a sensible system that meets those goals. As time goes by, your goals change or you add new ones, and you have to adapt that existing system to match.<p>Often, during the time since the initial development was planned out, you may have developed newer techniques for solving your problems, or you may have new tools available that weren't before, or you may have worked with some new people who have better ideas about something. In short, you may have a better way to do things than before. Now you have exactly three choices:<p>1. Stick to your existing design/ideas and don't use the better ways. (Pros: Maintains consistency and doesn't incur (re)training overheads. Cons: May cost more and/or get worse results for the new work, or may simply not be possible if you need a new approach to satisfy your new goals.)<p>2. Use the better ways, but only for new/future work. (Pro: Best cost and results for that new work taken in isolation. Cons: Might mean an entire new design co-existing with your previous one(s), with potential compatibility problems, integration costs, future maintenance overheads, etc, and might cost more to implement separately than it would have done if you'd known ahead of time and created a more general design to support both the old and new parts earlier.)<p>3. Switch everything to the better ways, a.k.a. The Big Rewrite. (Pros: Keeps your entire system using the best possible tools/ideas, and keeps the whole code base consistent and systematically designed across the board. Cons: Can be extremely expensive relative to incremental changes, you can easily lose little fixes/improvements that had been carefully worked into the original code base over time, and you may have to retrain some of your team before they can work with the new version.)<p>This is an exhaustive set of your options if you're going to do that new development but your team and the world have moved on since the original work. Every one of them has at least one serious downside, and unless you do a full rewrite across your entire code base every time you develop any improvement, those downsides always include some degree of inconsistency or stagnation.",1354905204

Putting lawyers out of work will mean they will try to rewrite the law to ban you. Depending on how you structure it, you might want to ally with a few firms in each vertical to rain fire upon their competitors. As long as you divide and conquer, and some lawyers are profiting from the new regime, it will make it much more difficult for the ABA to achieve consensus on the imminent threat your startup undoubtedly poses to the health of the republic.<p>EDIT: Even more interesting...as a dotcom you may also be able to market your services in a way that normal lawyers cannot.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_advertising#In_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_advertising#In_the_United...</a>",1354905056

""The flu"" is an umbrella term for a number of different infectious strains (that mutate), and the object of the game is to detect early on which virulent, dangerous and uncommon strains (already active elsewhere) are most likely to spread widely and vaccinate against them. Frequently, less-virulent strains to which a large percentage of the population has already been exposed will be ignored (hitting somebody with hundreds of strains to develop immunity to simultaneously reduces the effectiveness of the vaccine for all of them). And there's always the chance that a particularly nasty strain may become epidemic after this year's vaccine has been formulated and distributed (in which case, there may or may not be an effective vaccine available in time for people to develop immunity to that strain). So even though you have been effectively vaccinated against the targeted strain(s), you can still contract other strains.

For example, the veterans affairs administration provides services, mostly health services, directly to veterans. In that case, you'd expect 100% to be overhead, because VA doctors and hospitals are paid out of overhead.<p>Most federal welfare programs, however, involve cutting a check. Look at the Social Security Administration.

747427,comment,746917,747010,0,0,uggedal,,,"This is an often used misquotation. Her is the original passage with context from Antoine de Saint Exupéry's <i>Wind, Sand and Stars</i> (1967):<p>And now, having spoken of the men born of the pilot’s craft, I shall say something about the tool with which they work, the airplane. Have you ever looked at a modern airplane? Have you followed from year to year the evolution of its lines? Have you ever thought, not only about the airplane, but about whatever man builds, that all of man’s industrial efforts, all his computations and calculations, all the nights spent over working draughts and blueprints, invariably culminate in the production of a thing whose
sole and guiding principle is the ultimate principle of simplicity?<p>It is as if there were a natural law which ordained that to achieve this end, to refine the curve of a piece of furniture, or a ship's keel, or the fuselage
of an airplane, until gradually it partakes of the elementary purity of the curve of a human breast or shoulder, there must be the experimentation of several generations of craftsmen. <i>In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its
nakedness.</i>",1249645746

It is the cost the company would otherwise pay for the benefit. What companies deduct from your paycheck is not the full amount, which under COBRA you will be responsible for. In addition, the company pays the benefits with pre-tax dollars (so they actually have an incentive to provide the most expensive insurance), while you now will be paying COBRA with after-tax dollars (hopefully from your savings).

747417,comment,747009,747364,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"You certainly raise a lot of interesting and valid points. I don't disagree.<p>I think that most people (including me!) would argue that just because somebody (or some government body) calls itself socialist, doesn't make it so. Everything I know about the Nazi government points to that -- they called themselves socialist, but they weren't, not really. Very similar to their line on religion, too. With one hand they claimed to be Christian, but on the other hand, Hitler and his govt implemented policies that were meant to greatly reduce the popularity of religion (e.g. church taxes -- still in existence today!).<p>Socialism doesn't necessarily mean a centrally controlled or planned economy, or govt owning businesses, or govt employing everyone and the division of resources. That, to me, sounds more like communism. Socialism the way it's practiced in most of the EU today involves a type of capitalism, with an underpinning of higher tax rate, worker/consumer protection laws, and social services.<p>So those things don't necessarily go hand-in-hand.<p>Austria really <i>is</i> a perfect test case, because the emperors had a rather populist bent compared to other emperors/empires. You nailed that for sure.<p>But... its military is absolutely pathetic. They have no budget, no war machinery, no devotion, and no popular support. All this despite, or perhaps because of, youth conscription. (Every male has to do 9 - 12 mos I think, in military or social services. Which pretty much means guarding the border and helping out in avalanches.)<p>I don't know where you're from, if you're aware of the perception of the military/govt in Austria. If you are, forgive me if I am repeating things you already know :)<p>But, for example, the Austrian military recently purchased a small batch (I think 6?) of old fighter jets. Not all, apparently, in working order (and it's questionable if they even have sufficiently trained people to make use of them). They will never get used. And this has become a quintessential national joke -- about how they bought a bunch of broken planes, how they think they're relevant but they're not, etc. Not just on the street, but in the newspapers.<p>The cities are surprisingly rich with anti-nationalists, people who think nationalism is a disease, who hold protests and summits against government, capitalism, racism, the EU, socialism (quite a lot of communists here) and so on.<p>The economy isn't centrally controlled; it's not as easy to start a business as in the US, but it's still very easy; it is, in my mind, a great mix of socialized services and free market. There are consumer and worker protection laws, but the tax rate is not nearly as high as, say, Denmark.<p>You can even get unemployment benefits if you quit your job (or are self-employed), to encourage worker mobility (which puts pressure on employers to shape up) -- and yet the unemployment rate is extremely low.<p>But despite all these goodies, Austria is hardly a country where government is Mother and Father, and the people are ready to fall in line and fight for her.<p>Compared to the US, Austria is as unpatriotic as they come. Nobody sings songs about Austria. Nobody talks about how they are so grateful to be ""free"" (or the Austrian equivalent). Nobody goes around saying ""Well, sure there are problems, but our x system is the best in the world!"" There is simply not the same kind of beloved national mythos we have in the US (although people do seem quite fond of the last real emperor and empress).<p>Nobody even displays the flag.<p>In fact, I'd go so far as to say that Austrians are a spoiled lot, because they have no idea how good they have it. :)<p>As for innovation - one of the things that has helped me the most have been ""alternative therapies,"" including an immune system booster medication called Bronchovaxom.<p>Turns out it costs nothing, because it's a bunch of dead bacteria, works extremely well... and isn't available in the US. Guess it doesn't make enough of a profit to make the FDA approval process worth the money?<p>Profit motive is only a motive for certain kinds of innovations. Many of the biggest life-saving inventions in healthcare came from love of humanity or curiosity, not profit motive (think antibiotics and vaccinations).<p>EDIT: As an aside, regarding people being willing to fight for the country... every European I've told about the Pledge of Allegience has been absolutely gobsmacked. They don't believe that in the land of the free, every day, millions of schoolchildren are forced on pain of punishment to kiss up to the government. Now <i>that's</i> kinda brainwashy, if you think about it.",1249645209

I think you'd really enjoy it; it's by RKM and it's subtitled: ""England, Germany and the coming of the Great War.""<p>It's one of the most entertaining books I've ever read.<p>What is interesting to me, though, is how Great Britain was an amazingly capitalist power. I never really realized the extent to which the entire empire -- which never really made that much money for the government -- was just a thin candy shell around British commerce, which made England the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. It's staggering to see, during the Naval Arms Race, how tiny england, with half the population of massively industrialized Germany, dedicated itself to laying 2 keels to every 1 that Germany laid down.<p>I agree with your sentiment that the socialist countries forced a degree of socialism on the more independent, capitalist nations. Look at Great Britain! It causes physical pain to look back and see what the taxation picture was before the world wars.<p>But.<p>There are other emergences of socialism that are called for and accepted because they're the best <i>workable</i> way of providing something that's necessary, either for business reasons or the demands of human liberty.<p>Sure, maybe someone can figure out a way to have all private toll roads, and make that work without ridiculous regulation and abuse ... in the meantime, we have to move goods. We're going to socialize that, fully realizing how hard de-socializing is, because we have crap to get done.<p>On the other end of the spectrum, child labor laws. I'm of one accord with the thrust of an observation made by Paul Graham -- 'maybe child labor laws are saving kids from something they don't need saving from; maybe 17-year-olds could <i>do</i> something.' Bravo! Until we can figure out a way of carefully instilling a culture of real productivity into youth, however, we had an existing problem of four-year-olds working with machinery that sometimes ate their fingers.<p>At the moment, health in the States is a joke compared to the rest of the first world.<p>Currently, the system of incentives we have pressures people to sacrifice their precious health for a few extra short-term dollars. Because of the economic circumstances of their parents, children will die in this country that would have grown to adulthood in the rest of the first world. The incentives are set up to encourage reckless behavior that will eventually result in a crushing burden of debt, so people will be trapped in poverty who could have escaped in other countries.<p>These are massive, existing problems in the US. Now, you can't blame a country for doing what the rest of the first world has done, which is to say: let's fix the problem.<p>It seems unreasonable to expect any <i>other</i> behavior.",1249644163

What pollution was generated? Which parts of society benefited, and which did not?<p>Here is a contrived example:<p>Suppose you obtained $20k by applying your skills as a consultant where you helped some business make an additional $200k profit by more effectively advertising their products.<p>Suppose that business has a profit of 20% for each item they sell, so you&#x27;ve actually lifted their revenue by $1m.<p>Now, suppose these products are essentially useless consumer products that will go out of fashion within 1 year.<p>I claim without evidence that the environmental impact of producing, advertising, distributing and disposing of $1m of useless products may, in many cases, be well in excess of how much of that impact you could attempt to reverse with a $20k budget.<p>So, another option is to consider is that the world may be better off if you didn&#x27;t earn that $20k in the first place.

9796012,comment,9795084,9795084,0,0,tzs,,,">> Being a numbers guy, I couldn’t resist calculating the odds of making four sell recommendations on what ends up being the four best performers out of 749 different stocks. Can we have a drum roll? The odds are 1 in 13.1 billion<p>> The odds are actually 1 out of 16<p>Both of these look likely wrong to me.<p>The first, from a CBS article, is, I believe, based on there being 13008631251 ways to pick an unordered collection of 4 items out of a set of 749. But where does that 749 come from? It&#x27;s the number of stocks listed on the Wilshire U.S. Large-Cap Index.<p>There&#x27;s nothing in the CBS article that ties this to Cramer. The author wanted data on the top performing stocks to see how Cramer did. He asked the S&P Dow Jones Indices people for the data from the S&P 500, and they didn&#x27;t have what he needed. Then he asked the Wilshire people, and they had it.<p>If the S&P Dow Jones Indices had the data, he presumably would have used the number of stocks on the S&P 500, ran the computation using 500 instead of 749, and came up with 2573031125 instead of 13008631251.<p>1 out of 16 also seems wrong. That would be the odds that a given set of 4 stocks Cramer picked would all go the opposite way that Cramer picked, if Cramer&#x27;s picks were no better than random chance.<p>I think what we actually want here is to look at all of Cramer&#x27;s picks in the applicable time frame, and determine what fraction of them, f, were ones he picked to go down. The odds that the 4 stocks that turned out best would be in his down list if his picks were by chance would then be 1 out of 1/f^4. This is only 1 out of 16 if Cramer picked half the stocks to go down and half to go up.",1435542270

Use frameworks to make implementation as fast as possible. Probably cost the founders $20k - $30k.

A key factor to this is focusing on what information is being shared but neglecting to account who it is being shared with and the privacy benefits associated with interacting with that service instead of traditional alternatives. For example, Google can see every search a person conducts regarding their sexual preferences.  However, a closeted homosexual might turn to Google to find social and support groups because they&#x27;re afraid of judgement from their family and peers.  Groups like the EFF would say that buying a book through a Kindle is awful for the privacy of the reader because Amazon tracks the fact that you specifically bought the book and can see when you&#x27;re reading it and even what page you&#x27;re on - but most readers don&#x27;t care that  Amazon knows they&#x27;re reading 50 Shades of Grey; they&#x27;d rather that everyone else on the subway just sees them reading their Kindle instead of an erotic novel paperback.<p>In general, people are more afraid of having their sensitive personal details disclosed to the people they interact with in person - their families, friends, coworkers or even the checkout lady at the pharmacy.  The loss of privacy to a remote party like Google is worth the net gain in privacy to avoid disclosing embarrassing information to people they are more concerned with.  This is also dependent on the type information being disclosed - the set of information that you&#x27;d want to keep from your friends is not the same set that you&#x27;d want to keep from your spouse, which is not the same as what you&#x27;d keep from your coworkers, which is not the same as what you&#x27;d hide from the police.<p>For those that would prefer an audio version, Ben Wittes gives a good discussion of it on the Lawfare Podcast at <a href=""http://traffic.libsyn.com/lawfare/Episode_129.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://traffic.libsyn.com/lawfare/Episode_129.mp3</a>",1435540659

I am not even saying the author of the specific Javascript that provides an easy NoScript evasion will be trying to screw you. I am saying that it is not uncommon to find DOM corruption flaws in clientside JS libraries, and if those libraries are hosted on whitelisted CDNs, those flaws are all NoScript evasions.<p>Two things that may not be intuitively clear to every reader:<p>1. No way do all of those sites actually do full security audits for every .js file on their domain. (Google comes close.)<p>2. The specific kind of security flaw we&#x27;re talking about is not necessarily &quot;interesting&quot; outside the context of NoScript. There are plenty of clientside DOM corruption bugs that don&#x27;t even get documented, let alone fixed, because they can&#x27;t easily be used to compromise a user session.

Not sure why you keep bringing up smartcards as alternative to long cable: two totally different things.<p>True, a smart card doesn&#x27;t give you separate input/output terminals. But it can isolate the key and encryption bit. It can be quite secure in case of theft, off-line access.<p>[ed: I wasn&#x27;t talking about just the cable, I was thinking about all the devices soldered into it. They look big enough for there to be a possibility to embed a listening device. That is if you&#x27;re a direct target by something like the Egyptian Secret Police etc]<p>Certainly this system has different and stronger security properties -- but also usability issues (even if you could probably sandwich most of it into a single laptop case. Would be interesting to have two screens side-by-side for input and output).<p>Do you know anything about throughput for this? Would it be viable for high-quality video chat?<p>> TFC and Linux/Android-based clients have no comparison given only one can make a strong security argument under all conditions of software attack and the others just have so many real-world attacks... Apple to oranges, my friend.<p>I meant and Android hw device, similar to running a stripped down OS on pc hardware. Sort of as a replacement for the hw in the terminals used here. I didn&#x27;t mean a full Android software stack. Preferably a system without baseband, networking etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about your use of &quot;NIX&quot; here. Is this a combined hardware/software platform? Google wasn&#x27;t very helpful.<p>It is of course true that if you can compromise the keyboard, display driver, kernel, i/o for gpg etc -- you can actively compromise the system.<p>As far as I know, typical Linux/bsd installs are not vulnerable to compromise either via a usb stick or via tcp/ip (assuming updates are disabled). So it would <i>seem</i> that using a dedicated (mostly) air-gapped laptop would <i>practically</i> be as secure. In such a case, keeping keys/crypto on an open-hw smartcard might be a prudent extra step that would add a little more security against certain threats.<p>> For cascading, it might be overkill and might not.<p>As long as one can show that cascading doesn&#x27;t <i>weaken</i> the system (eg: perhaps a construction opened up some kind of oracle, along the lines of compression+encryption, perhaps key derivation would leak information on a master secret if one uses related keys) -- I don&#x27;t see much of a reason not to.<p>On the other hand, if you double the number of crypto systems in use, you double the number of bugs. Of course, it might be that the attacker can&#x27;t attack bugs in the inner systems easily, so perhaps by layering you get to choose which system are most easily exploited...<p>Either way, I think both an air-gapped computer+smartcard and this system would be secure enough, that if you are a target, someone might want to try and sell you special, compromised hardware. It might not compromise the system as such, but even just a microphone+transmitter in any one of the components might be enough to pick up sounds of typing, and be able to infer plaintext. Not sure what the easiest way to read the screen would be, but probably some kind of signal leakage from the gpu/cable/screen.",1435540086

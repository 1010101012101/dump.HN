If that is insufficient I grab my iPad. If that is insufficient, I grab a laptop.<p>The older I get, and the more writing I do rather than software development, the more I gravitate to smaller devices. It amazes me how easy it is to edit and write manuscripts on small devices. Same as for doing research by web browsing, taking notes, etc.<p>For some people, they can skip device size levels. For example, some people might only need a phone, a phone + laptop, or perhaps just a tablet with 4g.<p>I think Apple is making the right decision spreading their product lines to more device types and sizes inside types.",1449287918

I&#x27;ve been using a super simple program called FreePCB for really simple analog stuff that can be routed by hand.<p>The thing that gets sent to the board fab is a set of files in &quot;Gerber&quot; format. So, the Gerbers are your last chance to confirm that the boards will be what you want. I suggest using a Gerber viewing program and look carefully at all of the files to make sure that they agree with your conception of what you expect the board to look like.<p>Finally, whatever fab house you choose, read all of their instructions and design rules, both to confirm that your board has a chance of being made, and because it&#x27;s educational.<p>I&#x27;ve been happy with www.pcbfabrication.com for several runs of boards.

It stands to reason that the brain structures we have without deliberate practice are not some neutral state of the human brain, but a reflection of our social context.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944261/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944261/</a><p>Abstract: In a recent visit to the United States, the Dalai Lama gave a speech at the Society for Neuroscience&#x27;s annual meeting in Washington, D.C. Over the past several years, he has helped recruit Tibetan Buddhist monks for, and directly encouraged research on the brain and meditation in the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The findings from studies in this unusual sample as well as related research efforts, suggest that, over the course of meditating for tens of thousands of hours, the long-term practitioners had actually altered the structure and function of their brains. In this article we discuss neuroplasticity, which encompasses such alterations, and the findings from these studies. Further, we comment on the associated signal processing (SP) challenges, current status and how SP can contribute to advance these studies.<p>Choice quote: &quot;Expert meditators also showed less activation than novices in the amygdala during FA meditation in response to emotional sounds. Activation in this affective region correlated negatively with hours of practice in life, as shown in Figure 1(A). This finding may support the idea that, advanced levels of concentration are associated with a significant decrease in emotionally reactive behaviors that are incompatible with stability of concentration.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22661409"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22661409</a><p>Abstract: The development of social emotions such as compassion is crucial for successful social interactions as well as for the maintenance of mental and physical health, especially when confronted with distressing life events. Yet, the neural mechanisms supporting the training of these emotions are poorly understood. To study affective plasticity in healthy adults, we measured functional neural and subjective responses to witnessing the distress of others in a newly developed task (Socio-affective Video Task). Participants&#x27; initial empathic responses to the task were accompanied by negative affect and activations in the anterior insula and anterior medial cingulate cortex--a core neural network underlying empathy for pain. Whereas participants reacted with negative affect before training, compassion training increased positive affective experiences, even in response to witnessing others in distress. On the neural level, we observed that, compared with a memory control group, compassion training elicited activity in a neural network including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, putamen, pallidum, and ventral tegmental area--brain regions previously associated with positive affect and affiliation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the deliberate cultivation of compassion offers a new coping strategy that fosters positive affect even when confronted with the distress of others.",1449286643

We are a non-profit organization that enables users to build virtual wardrobes and share their style with friends, family, or the world. All surplus revenue was to go to charity, and we had hoped to create a charitable organization called the “Spare Two Project,” encouraging people to volunteer two hours a month for the good of the community.<p>We have a vision that people seem to love, women in particular, and a mostly working product, but we recently exhausted all of our funds and have to close shop. We made a few mistakes in the beginning not capturing a small userbase with an MVP early, which hit us hard building without solid user feedback and the poor numbers didn&#x27;t help with finding investors. We have scrapers to continually harvest new apparel from across the web and have affiliate programs active to generate revenue if there were active users. For now, we have decided to cease development but keep the site live.<p>Our CEO, Peter Hubbs, is one of the most kind and commendable people I have met, and I don&#x27;t want to see him completely down and out with nothing but experience and lessons learned if there are any options we have yet to consider. So HN, I ask: do we actually have a solid idea? Is Sparehanger good enough to capture users? If so, how do we capture users with no capital? If not, is Sparehanger even worth the cost of keeping live?  And what should we do now?<p>Thanks in advance for any advice you may have.<p>https://www.sparehanger.com/<p>http://www.lsureveille.com/daily/lsu-graduate-creates-interactive-fashion-website/article_46dfa3be-7b57-11e4-811c-3313a5c10fa6.html",1449285381

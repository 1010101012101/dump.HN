7682938,comment,7682189,7682189,16,0,dang,,,"You&#x27;re welcome to try posting the thread. I think it would be interesting. For best results, it should probably be a separate post from the current discussion.<p>Having it recur monthly, though, is another matter. Since there have been a lot of proposals for recurring threads lately, maybe I should share our thinking on this.<p>The bar for recurring threads on HN is high. People often suggest new ones, but I&#x27;m doubtful that most would improve the quality of the site. When in doubt, we will err on the side of not promoting discussions (even vibrant and interesting discussions) to regular features, because once ensconced, they will be hard to remove—and because predictable things inevitably get less interesting.<p>Tho whoishiring threads are a special case, because they compensate for the injunction against general job posts on HN.<p>I understand the feeling of &quot;wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if...&quot; and the danger of being a party-pooper, so I&#x27;m not shutting the door on these ideas. But it&#x27;s helpful to remember what HN is: a site for intellectually interesting articles and discussions. Optimizing for that quality is pretty much our sole concern. From that you can derive a lot about what to say &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; to.<p>People have always used HN for unofficial and informal purposes—that&#x27;s wonderful! I&#x27;m not talking about any of that here—only about the core. For example, many of us have friends whom we somehow met because of HN—but that doesn&#x27;t make HN a friend-matching service. (I originally wrote &quot;friend-finder&quot;. We&#x27;re not that either.)<p>So the default answer to &quot;can we make a regular thread for ‘foo’&quot; is &quot;no&quot;, because a regular thread is a feature, and the default answer to new features is &quot;no&quot; unless ‘foo’ serves the core.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m going to demote this thread now since it isn&#x27;t really on topic.",1398981584

7682914,comment,7677976,7677976,2,0,BrandonMarc,,,"Here&#x27;s my question. I don&#x27;t know if the documentary follows this vein or answers it, but I&#x27;d like to know. Does Carmen Ortiz (or her bosses) feel sincere remorse? Or does she feel like she&#x27;s a victim of who-knows-what?<p>Like Richard Fernandez [1], I can say the appropriateness of her behavior is beyond my competence to comment on, but the context of her actions is pretty interesting.<p>Carmen was being groomed for a potential run for Governor. Before her witch hunt blew up in her face, she was getting glowing media exposure [2], describing her as the protege of high Democratic Party officials, helping cement her story in the minds of voters.<p>Sadly, in American politics it&#x27;s all about the story you can tell. Oh, your parents were born in Puerto Rico, and you grew up in poor areas of NYC? Well, dear, with your rags-to-riches story and our headlines, we&#x27;ll sell plenty of birdcage liner, we&#x27;ll sell your story to the masses, and good luck on your election.<p>The story is what matters ... and the <i>story</i> of a US Attorney who grew up in a housing project while Hispanic and female makes a formidable political opponent. The &quot;narrative&quot; plays such an important part in public life these days that people can hardly go anywhere without it. From Lance Armstrong to Manti Te&#x27;o everybody seems to need an angle.<p>It seems to me like Carmen just needed a good scalp to hang on her wall, and if that meant charging Aaron to the moon and back (hoping for a plea deal to a tiny fraction of the charges) well you know what they say about eggs and omelets.<p>But ... Aaron was a human being. You can only push someone so far, before they behave in a way you don&#x27;t expect. And how the mighty Carmen fell [3]:<p><i>Just days ago, speculation was rampant. Gov. Carmen Ortiz? U.S. Sen. Carmen Ortiz? Well, that’s all over now. U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz is done. Finished. Forever linked to bringing the full and frightening weight of the federal government down upon a 26-year-old computer genius — and a suicide risk.</i><p>So like I said, how does she feel? Another article in the Boston herald [4] mentioned she was terribly upset at Aaron&#x27;s death ... but if you read carefully, the article says she was terribly upset at <i>being blamed for</i> Aaron&#x27;s death. Now that&#x27;s something different.<p>I know where I stand. I suspect for legal reasons the film doesn&#x27;t even touch this question, which is maybe even reasonable, I guess ... give her the benefit of the doubt ... but at the same time it&#x27;s rather sad, since she certainly didn&#x27;t give that to Aaron.<p>----------------------------------------<p>[1] <a href=""http://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2013/01/17/crime-story/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2013/01/17/crime-story/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/12/07/patrick-reportedly-cites-prosecutor-vying-for-governor/0aEpGj5QqjvJfgSwgFNc7H/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/12/07/patrick-reported...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://bostonherald.com/comments/1062230411"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bostonherald.com/comments/1062230411</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2013/01/emotional_carmen_ortiz_terribly_upset%E2%80%99_over_swartz_suicide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2013/01/...</a><p>[also] <a href=""http://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2013/01/17/ortiz-is-done/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pjmedia.com/richardfernandez/2013/01/17/ortiz-is-done...</a>",1398981307

At this point, I have 5x the savings I would qualify for as a credit limit anyway, so I guess I&#x27;ve grown into my lack of credit cards over time.

I wrote the NASM example in the same order for ease of comparison, but it can be shuffled around in any order as long as the expression simplifies to a valid addressing mode.<p>When using AT&T syntax, I also find it cleaner to drop the size suffix (movq vs mov) from the instruction whenever the size can be inferred from a register.

If your business can&#x27;t follow the law, you will likely go out of business trying to. And laws change, and that can affect your business. This is the same as it&#x27;s always been.<p>If your business goes away, some other business that can sustain itself under the law will pop up there (possibly in the same area of business, possibly a completely different one), or the economy will start tanking because no business can sustain themselves due to the new laws.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s not a good idea to leave the choice up to the consumer. (for example: If you stop allowing us to keep slaves, we&#x27;ll have to pay workers and prices will rise!) Sometimes there are bigger considerations. I feel that privacy is one of those, personally, but it&#x27;s valid to disagree with me.",1398979298

The official narrative doesn&#x27;t explain everything, it&#x27;s more like a comfortable half-truth.  We&#x27;re trained from birth to buy into a completely rational scientific viewpoint of the world, which is clearly accurate- but it&#x27;s actually more like measuring objects inside of World of Warcraft when it&#x27;s obvious that there&#x27;s something bigger going on outside of the game.  It just doesn&#x27;t matter that much and isn&#x27;t as interesting as the realization that we have no idea what we&#x27;re in.<p>We are rewarded for buying into the official narrative with social credits by an organization we have created to control our minds (govern-ment).  People want to be comforted and feel like they have control over what&#x27;s going on, and society pays us to sell them these comfortable reassurances.  This is social control and it makes us productive.<p>Most cultures become more spiritual and religion plays a more significant role as we age.  Psychotic shock from emotional damage (this is not necessary schizophrenia or &quot;insanity&quot;) is actually a necessary part of the human growth process.  It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to explain this to younger people, the only thing one can do as an adult is to program our children with the metaphors of choice (religion) to give them something to cling to when their bubble bursts.<p>Please see my website for my full story if you appreciate my explanation here.",1398979219

Based on previous comment history, I presume that &#x27;masklinn&#x27; understands perfectly well how assert() works.  Yes, if you define NDEBUG your error handling will go away.  So don&#x27;t define NDEBUG unless you want your error handling to go away!<p>By contrast, your assertion that <i>Some compilers will set that for you in an optimized build</i> strikes me as unlikely.  Some program specific build systems do this, and if you use one of them you should be aware that your assert() functions may drop out.  But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used a compiler that drops the assert() based on optimization level.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly disagree with your conclusion, just your argument.  I think &#x27;awda&#x27; gets closer to the truth:  the default assert() from <assert.h> with its negative reliance on NDEBUG is tricky and probably best avoided -- not just for error handling but altogether.  Personally, I use two distinct macros: ERROR_ASSERT() and DEBUG_ASSERT().  ERROR_ASSERT() cannot be disabled, and DEBUG_ASSERT() only runs if DEBUG was defined at compile time.",1398978180

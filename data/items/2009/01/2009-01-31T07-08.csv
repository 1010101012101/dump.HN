459344,comment,458659,458659,0,0,martian,,,"I would suspect that you would want to pay attention to where your users are. If you're a Web 2.0 social network site, then Twitter is probably essential since most of your users would likely be using Twitter as well. Same things goes for Delicious. If you're in the US, then look into getting a presence on Facebook or MySpace (MySpace especially if you're working with music). If you're somewhere overseas, then Orkut may be worth a look. If you're a design firm, it probably wouldn't hurt to have a Flickr account.<p>The answer to this question seems to depend on where your users hang out. If they hang out on the web, then be on the web. If they hang out at trade shows, then go to trade shows.<p>(Sam_in_nyc, I read your profile so know that not all of this applies directly to your situation, but maybe it's useful for thinking about the more general case...?)",1233387668

459340,comment,459289,459289,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"That principle doesn't work online. In general you can say stuff to people in person that's insulting and abusive, and then just give a wry smile and everybody laughs. You can't do that online. The guideline has it exactly wrong.<p>The problem is that what you say online about someone is frozen forever, and takes on more significance than either the sender or the receiver actually meant. In person, I call you an asshole, you're impressed that I said it to your face, we both laugh and move on. On the web I call you an asshole, you call me an asshole, it escalates, shows up in google searches for both our names, people who aren't quite up to speed on things (recruiters) take it more seriously than it should be... bad stuff happens.",1233386914

459337,comment,459289,459310,0,0,TooMuchNick,,,"It would be healthy for submitters to look at headlines before they copy them directly, realizing that what makes sense for a blogger (aware of Digg) seeking some well-deserved attention for a post might not make sense in an extremely specialized forum like Hacker News.<p>What I mean is, a blogger is completely justified in naming a post ""Why James Bond would never drink a Coke"" (like I did for an environmentalist blog) if that blogger believed their purpose would be best served by alerting Digg users to the perfidies of the Coca-Cola company. But if a Hacker News reader appreciated the post's message -- that Coca-Cola is exploiting water rights laws in third-world countries to produce its products cheaply at the expense of the residents and their clean water supplies -- they would do well to use a different headline that what the desperate blogger, often paid by the pageview, had written with a view to Digg.<p>That said, bloggers will more and more overhype their posts in the way that media have since their beginning, and those of us on small thinky web sites will have to get used to downvoting and moving on.",1233386874

Duplicity uses a full plus incrementals model compared to tarsnap's snapshot model, so with duplicity you're either going to be stuck paying to store extra versions you don't want or be stuck paying for multiple full backups.  Moreover, tarsnap is considerably more secure than duplicity.<p>Before I started working on tarsnap, I considered using duplicity; but it simply didn't measure up.",1233386725

459323,comment,459289,459289,0,0,kaens,,,"I'd personally like to say ""Please keep HN civil, free from trolling, and intellectual."" This site has been a great resource - and that's at least partially because the tone of the vast majority of the community here is pretty serious.<p>I have an account on reddit as well, and my tone over there is different than my tone here. On reddit I make a decent amount of off-the-cuff remarks, occasionally troll a bit, participate in pun threads, and also have a decent amount of intelligent debate and discussion. Here I keep my mouth (fingers?) shut (stoppped?) unless I have something to say, because that's the vibe here.<p>Here, I'm more likely to vote people up who have a differing opinion on an issue, or even if they have an opinion that <i>offends</i> me, if they are able of stating and defending their position logically. On reddit, I'd probably just skim over their post.<p>Etc.<p>The tone of this site has gotten a little lighter since the first time I was here, and it seems to have gotten a lot more of a focus on the business side of things, which is fine - but if people aren't careful, the site will devolve into yet another pick-your-favorite-site-here.<p>So yeah. Please keep HN grown-up. It's nice to see mostly responsible discussion happening on a site like this, and I hope it continues to happen.",1233385994

You know what gears are moving and what you need to do to get them to do something.<p>Django's willingness to do 70% of the work for me has always left me a bit uneasy. Too much automation happening under the hood. However I do applaud the effort of the Django community in building a rather comprehensive framework + libraries to stuff done.

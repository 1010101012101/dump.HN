I'm actively trying to promote my website, but Google stopped crawling my site for 3 months now. I've checked all my commits around the time Google stopped crawling, but there's nothing there that should have an influence!<p>I tested my website with proxies, web-sniffers, users from around the world: the website works for ALL of them. However if I try to 'fetch as Google' in the Google's webmaster tools, it always results in 'page unavailable'.<p>I emailed Google, but all I received (even after multiple tries) was pre-made answers of this kind ""Have you checked our forums?"" YES, I did! I posted my question, and didn't get any answer, which is why I'm emailing you now!<p>So yeah, I'm happy to see my website on DuckDuckGo, but I would really like to see it on Google; especially considering that my customers aren't necessary cutting edge...<p>- I tested with multiple proxies and web-sniffer tools.
- I checked my DNS
- I checked if my ISP was blocking Googlebot IPs
- I even checked with Wireshark and can see the Googlebot connection initiated!!<p>I asked Google to get a more useful explanation than just 'page unavailable', but alas...<p>So now I'm asking help from you.
Here is my website: http://goo.gl/aSX2u
Is there anything obvious that I'm missing? Why is Google ignoring me?<p>Thank you very much in advance!",1363881590

5415980,comment,5415256,5415627,5,0,arrrg,,,"You are wrong about the law in Germany.<p>As you correctly stated, <i>taking</i> photographs is very unregulated (and wasnt regulated at all until a few years ago) in Germany. Its only illegal to <i>take</i> photos in the places you listed. (Actually its not so much about specific places. The photos have to invade a private area of life, though that usually means places like the home, hotel rooms or restrooms are off limits.) This barrier is actually relatively high, not everything is immediately an invasion of a private area of life, even if it might seem so. A normal shot of you hanging out in a conference room with hundreds other people? Not an invasion of a private area of life.<p>This also means that privately owned but public spaces are not included there, like, say, conference halls or train stations or shopping malls and similar such places. As you also correctly stated, the owner can disallow photographs, though by default (i.e. if the owner doesnt have any rules) <i>taking</i> photographs is perfectly ok.<p>The issue is <i>publishing</i> photographs. There the barriers are much, much higher in Germany. If there are people in it, the default is that you are not allowed to publish them unless every person in the photograph agrees. Now, as always with the law, there are (of course) exceptions (e.g. if people are only incidental to the photograph and not the main subject, say if you take a photo of a building and there happen to be a few people in front of it), though none of them apply in this case. <i>Publishing</i> this photo wouldnt be legal in Germany (<i>taking</i> it would), though it is important to note that in Germany those depicted in the photo would have to come forward and press charges. Otherwise the police is not allowed to investigate or charge people. (You could say that the default assumption of the law is that everyone in published photographs agreed to it and if you dont its on you to come forward.)<p>However, that is not the case in the US where both taking and publishing this photo is perfectly legal. So I do not really see the relevance of this discussion.",1363881494

5415938,comment,5415555,5415555,6,0,neya,,,"It's a very mixed opinion from Anonymous, the first paragraph about Adria being an extremist is very fair and direct. Adria DID over-hear a PRIVATE conversation that wasn't meant for her, took a photo of two individuals WITHOUT their permission and posted it to her twitter account, accusing them of harassment. What Adria has done to the feminism community is not justice, but damage.<p>The whole point of feminism is about bringing equality - That there should exist no discernible separation lines between both the genders. But what Adria has done is made sure the males in future are extra-careful and scared of their female counter-parts when in a professional event, which itself is a terrible, subtle kind of discrimination. As a matter of fact, searching on Twitter reveals that many women do agree with this - She has damaged feminism, more than doing anything good.<p>I can only imagine the outrage of the same incident inverted - had those two men taken a photo of her and shared it on their Twitter accounts and had Adria been offended, the situation would be totally different and both these men would have been brought down their knees, this soft attitude towards Adria for violating someone else's privacy by itself is a sexist approach IMO.<p>I think, we all need to maintain a strict platform for justice - Don't be too soft on a woman because she's a woman, at the same time, don't be too hard on a man because he's a man and vice-versa. Regardless of gender, I believe justice should be served.<p>As a matter of fact, Adria has been deleting comments on her blog about people who tried to bring up a sexist remark that she made, yet she got away with (you can search for her name on twitter and can confirm this).<p>What Anonymous is doing here is a bit extremist in my opinion - Bringing down a whole company because they stood behind a dishonest employee and failed to offer any fairness or justification on their part. But, maybe if they were doing something illegal, I think they might as well go down. And I hope this serves as a very valuable lesson for others in the tech as well - Be it males or femals, to follow the path of righteousness instead of hating one another and waiting for a moment to simply bring the other gender to shame.<p>God, I just hope that there will be a day when I can sit next to a person and sit beside them and talk to them like a normal person without imposing restrictions on myself on my behaviour, appearance / characteristics instead of constantly trying to be aware that I am talking to {gender} instead of a <i>person</i> which is the situation as of now.",1363881152

5415927,comment,5415256,5415256,25,0,rburhum,,,"Having experienced PyCon for the first time this year, I am extremely saddened by how these events have unfolded. Ironically, I think this particular issue is eclipsing how female and kid friendly this conference is.<p>I have attended and spoken and several conferences (probably reaching the upper 80s) and this year's PyCon was more female-supportive than any other conference I have ever attended (Google IO, OSCON, WWDC, Where, BarCamps, etc etc).<p>Honestly, I was (happily) surprised about how many women attended and spoke. 20%! Of course, this number may seem low if you just blur it out, but in our industry, if you have ever attended any other tech conference, you will realize why 20% is such a high number.<p>The amount of attention and support PyLadies got from the PyCon/Python community was nothing short of <i>outstanding</i>. I sat during the PyCon PyLadies Fundraiser auction. I saw how crappy card games and posters signed by Guido and PyCon organizers sold for $300. I saw how the community managed to get ""A 30-min Walk from Jack Dorsey"" as one of the things to be auctioned. You don't just get that an item like that by sitting idle. Somebody from the PyCon community had to pull some strings and go through some efforts to get that for PyLadies. Heck, some guy, 1hr before the auction just gave <i></i>his personal Chromebook<i></i> for auction because he wanted to help the PyLadies cause. PyLadies raised 10K in less than 2hrs. All community-driven. I have never seen - in any conference - a community putting so much effort to push the goal of increasing women in tech. Never.<p>And yet all this drama is painting such a different picture of what I would consider the best conference I have ever attended. The biggest effort I have seen for women in tech, out-shadowed by a silly penis joke and all the drama that ensued after that.<p>To the PyCon organizers and PyLadies community as a whole: Don't let this get to you. You did an amazing job. To me, it was such an inspiring conference, that it will always be in my  schedule. The large amount of kids coding in python and playing with their Raspberry Pis, the ad-hoc tech donations that were being done teachers, the support to PyLadies, all that stuff that really matters, did not go unnoticed. It is just that we are not as loud as the rest. But we care. Thank you!!!",1363881092

And what happened is tragic.  Someone got fired for it.  Someone's livelihood was affected by this.  Not to mention the emotional shock this surely caused.<p>What's right and what's wrong?  Sometimes the answer isn't easy.  Private conversations between friends have been known to have content that surely someone, somewhere is bound to find offensive.<p>The other effect is that there are people who hear what they want to hear --or read what they want to read-- rather than what was actually said or written.  All you have to do is watch Fox News, CNN or, for that matter, any news show to see this effect.<p>HN is perfect proof of the fact that this happens.  I've seen it a bunch of times and I've experienced it myself.<p>A joke is a joke.  A dumb comment is a dumb comment.  It happens.  And, if it hasn't happened to you (plural) yet it surely will at one point or another.  I don't know any perfect people.<p>What saddens me in this case is the firing.  I think that was wrong.  Way wrong.  And absolutely unfair.<p>One thought that went through my mind is the idea of surveillance cameras picking up private conversations.  One could argue:  Well, be aware of it and act accordingly.  Then there's the question, perhaps legal, of what actually constitutes a private conversation protected by privacy laws.  Does one have the right to publish the contents of someone else's private conversation, whether it was overheard or picked-up via intentional or unintentional surveillance?  I don't know.  It's a bit disturbing because of the potential implications on the assumption of privacy in otherwise public settings.  Now you have to look around before having any kind of a conversation because you don't know if anything you say, offensive or not, might come back to pummel you on the Internet.<p>I would not be surprised if lawyers are involved at this point.

So the code you are getting for free (or cheaply) isn't coded how you would have liked. Code it from scratch or re-factor it to suit your needs.

That's not to say that large programs need to be built in weeks/months, that's all up to the dev talent that you employ, but your approach/strategy starts to change significantly; what you currently consider challenging will become trivial. I've also found that if the solution to a problem starts to get too complex, you're probably stuck with technical debt or doing it wrong.<p>Regarding the 'aha moment' -- it isn't actually as momentous as one thinks. It starts to become commonplace, and it's important that you don't let those moments guide you, but instead, treat them as milestones and learn from them. You're always going to learn, grow and craft your expertise. One thing I would personally suggest is for you to work on problems that you enjoy (if not in professional capacity, on the side).

It's unfortunate because as a small startup, you'd rather put your time into building the business.<p>But, fraudsters are relentless and they come in waves. You beat them back, all goes silent, then they come back with a vengeance. It never stops and they are inventive. Much of the fraud comes from outside the U.S. as well (China-big time in our experience), so there's virtually zero chance of prosecution. So, these guys have nothing to lose and everything to gain. If they get busted, they just don't get their money. It's all upside for them.<p>BTW, I used to think that raising the bar so they'll go elsewhere would be sufficient. It definitely helps, but it's not how it works. If there is <i>any</i> opportunity, there will be parties who persistently work you to find it, such that it will be a constant fight for you.<p>In any event, you are right that you will most likely be able to detect them at some point. It's just the cost/time involved and the damage to your brand/customers as they keep changing tactics. One thing you should assume is that whatever you put in place, they will defeat at some point. It is guaranteed.<p>Finally, services like siftscience also help, but they tend to just raise the signal and/or help you to corroborate suspicions. It can still take quite a bit of effort and invariably human interaction to interpret those signals.<p>Not that it can't be done. Just encouraging you to brace yourself for the fight ahead.

If it's ugly, it's because vim is ugly.<p>Your complaints about plugin management, Vimscript, and poor error handling are fair. When someone creates a modernized modal editor, I'll consider switching. Until then I'll suffer. It's incredibly satisfying when I do something really powerful in vim. It makes it my programming job more fun. A lot of programming is mundane editing. Editing with vim can make most painful editing tasks a fun challenge rather than a boring repetition of mouse clicks. This more than anything is why I won't switch to Sublime, even if I love its pretty face.<p>Vim (and unix tools) make you into, and feel like, a badass computer wizard. The more time you put into studying the spells, the more powerful spells you can cast. Newbs, do you want to be a Gandalf of computers (the answer is yes btw)? Then you need vim.",1363879189

Everyone is like this, many people do not even realize what some of their biases or prejudices are. Turning them into into figureheads strips away the complexity and says ""these guys are what is wrong"". Which is complete and utter bullshit. They were just two guys having a private conversation.<p>If someone says something in private that you disagree with then you should bring it up with them in private or get and intermediary, like the conference organizers to.

I make every attempt to keep these jokes private between my friends and I, but I'm sure others have heard me make them.  Some people might find them funny, others may be offended. It scares me to think that making an offhand penis joke could result in being publicly outed on Twitter with no opportunity to defend myself.<p>I believe that Adria Richards did not handle the situation appropriately. I believe she's being a hypocrite by taking offense one day, and making her own penis joke on Twitter the next.  I believe that she's further stoking the internet's rage by refusing to admit any fault.  I think the other women that are jumping to her defense are doing themselves, and women in technology a disservice.  They are not thinking critically or putting themselves in the conference attendee's shoes.  I'm quite sure they would not like to be publicly outed for a private conversation.<p>Public shaming was not the right way to handle the situation.  An apology from Adria would have gone a long way in defusing the situation.  She chose not to go this route.  I'm sad that a silly penis joke turned in to this.<p>Preemptive Edit:  I do NOT believe that ANYONE should suffer the wrath of the Internet.  I do NOT believe that ANY conference attendees should have to sit idly by and listen to penis jokes. I'm only saying that publicly shaming these guys was a mistake, and that an apology for the mistake could have basically fixed the problem before it got this far.",1363878477

Assuming the way she said it happened is correct, the guys behind her made a <i>sexual</i> (forking/fucking; Dongle/Penis) not sexist joke. If it were even to be seen as sexist, it was towards men.<p>2. I find it hard to see how taking their pictures and ""shaming"" them would have made anything thing better. It only set them up to be lynched verbally or otherwise.<p>3. It was a PRIVATE conversation in a public setting that was overheard. It happens to the best of us. There are 100s of bloopers on YouTube of broadcasters saying embarrassing things when the mic was supposed to be off.<p>4.

It makes no sense evangelizing for/to people that would be uncomfortable dealing with you. Appeal to understanding, not fear.<p>6. It is good to know she can stand for herself.

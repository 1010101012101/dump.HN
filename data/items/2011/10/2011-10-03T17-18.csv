What about Haskell's higher-kinded polymorphism? And pattern matching?<p>Lisp can do some of these, but it is not exactly a ""blub"" language. Is there a nice comparison of Qi and Haskell?

3067259,comment,3065672,3065672,14,0,jrockway,,,"Let's have a talk about the $ operator.  When you use it more than once per line, you're writing code that looks weird and is hard to read.  Switch to the similar function-composition operator, and everything looks more idiomatic.<p>Instead of:<p><pre><code>    fibServer x = quickHttpServe $ writeBS $ B.pack $ show (fibonacci x)
</code></pre>
Just write:<p><pre><code>    fibServer = quickHttpServe . writeBS . B.pack . show . fibonacci
</code></pre>
The case for $ is where you want application instead of composition:<p><pre><code>    fibOf42Server = quickHttpServe . writeBS . B.pack . show . fibonacci $ 42
</code></pre>
I even write things like:<p><pre><code>    main = print =<< foo
</code></pre>
instead of<p><pre><code>    main = foo >>= print
</code></pre>
for consistency.<p>Anyway, it's a little style thing, but it's nice to use the composition operator (.) when you want composition and the application operator ($) when you want application.  It makes the code look nicer and it shows its intent more clearly.  And really, they are different concepts, even if they both type-check the same.<p>And finally, remember that function application, by default, is the highest-precedence operator in Haskell.  When you write:<p><pre><code>    foo . (bar 42) . baz
</code></pre>
It's the same as:<p><pre><code>   foo . bar 42 . baz
</code></pre>
Because of operator precedence.  $ only exists to change the order of operations for a particular expression.",1317664241

3067243,comment,3065672,3067151,1,0,danieldk,,,"Both :). To give one specific example: I was working on a transformation-based learner for learning tree transformations. Say that a rule consists of an action and a list of condition that makes the action fire if they are true for a particular tree node. Obviously, you'll want to be able to add new conditions, so you make a type class for conditions:<p><pre><code>    class Cond a l where
      applies :: a -> TreePos Full l -> Bool
</code></pre>
Now, say that a rule contains a list of conditions which belong to the type class Cond (Cond a l => [a]). You can see the problem coming. Say I provide a condition of the type MyCondition, then the list will be of type [MyCondition]. However, in practice it would be inflexible to restrict a list of rules to one type. You want to be able to add new conditions outside the module or package binary. So, instead I used existential typing for conditions:<p><pre><code>  data Condition l =
    forall c . (Cond c l, Eq c, Show c, Typeable c) => Condition c</code></pre>",1317663891

* Reliability. Once something is stored in the database, I want a reasonably high level of guarantee that it won't be forgotten.
* Trivial replication so if I server goes down and takes the database with it, I can restore it quickly and have a backup server in the mean time.
* High speed on minimal hardware, so I wouldn't NEED to scale under likely usage scenarios.
* Easy path to scaling if it should become necessary.<p>Every SQL database I know takes nontrivial effort to shard. CouchDB has built-in master-master replication that takes two seconds to set up.<p>SQL imposes performance penalties that I simply don't need, and so NoSQL is going to be faster on the same hardware, and require less scaling.<p>CouchDB makes things so simple and low-maintenance that I don't need to hire people who understand it, because I can keep it maintained in my free time. I haven't needed to do anything with it after I spent a couple days to deploy it, and it's happily replicating to a second CouchDB instance that I can fall back on if needed.<p>And if I get to the point where I need to scale, well, it will work fine to create more CouchDB instances (my data is read FAR more often than it's written, so simple replication should be workable).<p>Even with MySQL, I feel like I would NEED an expert to be sure to achieve all of my goals above -- not because I couldn't, but because it would waste too much of my time.

3067183,comment,3061439,3061674,1,0,sathish316,,,"I'm surprised not many people have talked about BDD. BDD lets you focus on the behavior of a method, class, or a set of methods/classes that interact with each other without worrying about the internal implementation details, unlike TDD where you test every method and may end up with tests for dead code. BDD lets you paraphrase what you're trying to do and tells you when you're done. Having said that, i have to agree that TDD/BDD is just a tool and no one should be forced to using it as the only method.<p>As far as the problem of mocking http requests is concerned, most frameworks like Rails/Spring come with http mocks. But a much better solution is to make your controller code as trivial as possible and move as much of your business logic to models. RESTful design helps you solve this problem. This is not just useful for web applications. Moving your logic from controllers to models is a good MVC principle too. It gives you the flexibility to use a different GUI toolkit for the same code.<p>As far as the problem of mocking database calls, it depends on whether you prefer your test suites to be real or fast. For simple database calls, I'd rather hit the database and end up with tests that assert behavior than tests which redundantly repeat what the code is trying to do using mocks. Mocking is still a useful technique for things you can't control like an External API.<p>TDD/BDD is useful for most of the model-centric work we do in Web based software. I'm not sure how useful it would be in areas like language design, framework design, mathematical modeling, algorithm design etc. QuickCheck or some other form of program verification will be a much better choice if your work involves designing/verifying complex algorithms. Djikstra's quote:""Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs"" points out the problems with TDD. TDD ensures your system satisfies the specs and the addition of new features don't break existing behavior. But it does not protect your system from behaviors you did not anticipate when you wrote the code/tests in the first place. TDD/BDD will not make you a smarter programmer. Genius programmers like Rich Hickey don't need TDD. Hey, But we are mere mortals who work with other mere mortals in building non trivial systems. And TDD is just one of the ways to ensure fewer bugs in the system.",1317662491

Then why don't you start initiating the communication?

Usually the best advice is read a little, then write a lot.  Typically you can just look and some published code and go ""ah yes that's how you do it"".  But I find, for better or worse, Haskell really requires you to understand before you code. Which in the end means your study to code ratio is very different than almost any other language.<p>Most languages, even lisps, are somewhat tolerant of 'programming by guessing' for beginners. Usually you write terrible code that works, learn more and see what you did wrong.  Haskell is very unforgiving of this, if you don't understand why it works it probably won't",1317661804

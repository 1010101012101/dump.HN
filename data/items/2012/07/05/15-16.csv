The inverted pyramid is the idea that a newspaper article leads with the most important facts first, followed by lesser and lesser details, so that one will always have read the most important facts for a given amount of reading no matter how long that amount of reading is.<p>But that's not really the problem with the Wired article.  It's not in a newspaper, so it's legitimate to write it assuming the reader will read the whole thing.  It's perfectly fine for the author to tell the story in chronological order (or whatever order is appropriate for communicating the important ideas).<p>Instead, I think the problem you and I have with it are the unnecessary artistic flourishes and the non-standard chronology designed to ""pull"" the reader into the article.  Does anyone know what this aspect is called?<p>Edit: On second thought, maybe I'm just projecting.  Do you really think that this article would have been better as a reverse pyramid?",1341503884

The story here is being cast as a win against bureaucracy, but ignores the fact that he has significant mechanical and metabolic advantages against able-bodied athletes.<p>Final paragraphs:<p>> The end result of this is that Pistorius was ""cleared"", based not on science, but on a legal process that was manipulated by science and the huge drive to permit Pistorius to run.  And make no mistake, there is inspiration in the story.<p>> In fact, it got to the point where despite the science, I can appreciate the viewpoint of those who say ""Sure, there is an advantage, but there's only one such athlete, and he's not running away with the gold medals, and so the good outweighs the bad, so let him compete despite that advantage"".<p>> I disagree with that, but I can respect the opinion of those who believe it.  What cannot be accepted, however, is the assertion that there is no advantage.  Everything about the science points to the advantage, from the pacing strategy he uses, to the German-testing that found mechanical and metabolic differences, to the Texas testing which provided evidence of an athletic advantage.<p>> The science was clear, from the point of hypothesis, to the theory behind it, to the evidence.

Do you really think that people answering questions under ""programmers"" and under ""cstheory"" wouldn't also be suitably answering questions under ""cs""?  Would a question posted under ""cstheory"" not be useful to people posting under ""cs""?

There is no single metric that conveys the user experience (or performance).<p>Certainly optimizing for 1ms because of the overhead for gzip compression isn't where you should be spending your time but I have dozens of cases in the WebPagetest forums where users have had 5+ second TTFB times and needed help figuring out what was going on.  I have even seen cases where it was over 20 seconds (search for TTFB in the forums and you'll be shocked).  It is usually a combination of shared hosting and excessive database queries by their CMS but it is common enough that completely ignoring it would be a very BAD idea.<p>Companies like Cloudflare can help the real TTFB (without cheating) by optimizing the conection between the end user and the origin site.  Most CDN's call it DSA where they maintain a persistent connection back to the origin and eliminate some of the round trip times.  Cloudflare's recently-launched Railgun feature should have a similar benefit.<p>It's actually a pretty well-known best-practice for web performance to ""flush the document early"" if you have any expensive back-end processing to do.  This isn't cheating and involves sending as much of the HTML content as possible to give the browser a head-start downloading external resources (css, js, etc).<p>Doing it with just the HTTP headers in order to cheat the metric itself is not in anybody's interest.",1341502079

Browsers can start parsing gzipped content as soon as they can decompress a block, but they have to wait for a whole block to arrive, which means for gzipped content they will often have to wait for more than the first packet to arrive. (Due to TCP slow-start, this may be another round-trip.)  This means they are also waiting longer to start fetching <head> contents.<p>There's a simple fix for this, which is to call deflate(..., Z_SYNC_FLUSH) on a chunk that is likely to compress to under 1500 bytes, like maybe all of <head> or the first 4k.  The total compressed size will be slightly larger, but the tradeoff is usually worth it.  Nginx doesn't currently do this, but would be a nice optimization to make available.<p>It's possible to work around this in Nginx by using the embedded perl module and SSI.

You cannot just equate the two. Corruption as described by the GP is like a cancer which has metastasized all over the body; corruption in the West is like an isolated blotch of melanoma on the skin.<p>So yes, there is corruption everywhere I guess ( perhaps even in Sweden and Norway and Switzerland); but it's not at the same level as that in Somalia and Russia.<p>The thing that draws entrepreneurs from all over the world to the US is that it is almost trivial to register and start a business here; and even if you're wildly successful, your ""corruption overhead"" is minimal (the occasional $35K dinner for $PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE notwithstanding).

Particularly the crux of the essay:<p><i>Any halfway decent programmer can quickly glean the general intent of most imperative code  even in a language he or she has never seen. While you can certainly figure out what functional routines do by looking at them, it may not be possible in a glance. Unlike imperative code, functional code doesnt map to simple language constructs. Rather, it maps to mathematical constructs.</i><p>What's actually the case is: any decent <i>imperative</i> programmer can quickly glean the general intent of most imperative code; equally, any decent <i>functional</i> programmer can quickly glean the general intent of most <i>functional</i> code. Furthermore, anyone with a decent grounding in merely <i>algebra</i> can quickly glean the general intent of well-written functional code. The same cannot be said of imperative code.<p>As for ugly syntax... well, I don't know Erlang, but that Haskell is <i>incredibly</i> badly mangled. Haskell can be beautiful -- substantially more so than most languages, I'd say.

If you mess up you know exactly why. You'll be able to constantly adapt yourself to become better.\n3) Waiting for your ""role"" to be utilized within an organization may sound great because you have free time, but it causes stagnation and ""Diva-ism"". That is the whole ""Its not my job, so I don't care about your problem"" or ""You need me more than I need you"" attitude.\n4) You can move relatively quickly since the code and logic is coming directly from you.<p>Yes, specialists are very important. For large organizations they are very needed. But, to get things to work right now, you need to be flexible and open-minded. Look at Facebook's UI, its not the prettiest (blue bar at the top and 3 columns), yet its an extremely popular product. Most users just want the damn thing to work.<p>I'm no web designer, but I understand that a clean UI is needed. I'm not a DB guy, but I can figure out most problems. Etc. etc.<p>I think that's what Zuck actually wants in his engineers. Guys and gals that can see a problem and fix it on their own. Guys and gals that can think of a cool idea, test it, and have it released for that 1%.<p>Code reviews and peer help will smooth things out. I believe it was Jamie Zawinski's interview in the book ""Coders at Work"" that had the same mantra when he developed Netscape. Just get the thing out fast. You'll get more eyes on it. And you can always make it better the next time around.<p>It seems like a lot of shops do that. Its a cut throat world and if you spend too much time trying to be super clean and precise, you'll still be on version 1 while your competitor is on version 10.",1341500556

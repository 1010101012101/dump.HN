She was doing a survey of businesses along Avenue C (Alphabet City) in reaction to complaints of a swelling rat population on Avenue B.  Apparently, Hurricane Sandy had washed significant parts of the rat population from Avenue C to Avenue B...and with the start of the cold season, those rats will be looking for warmer places to hang...perhaps on Avenue B.",1417672799

Cheap oil means people won&#x27;t feel as much pain if a carbon tax is put in place to compensate for the externalities of using fossil fuels. So this is an opportunity for political movements in countries to push through a carbon tax now. Then when the price of oil goes back up (i.e. after OPEC has driven out the frackers and hurt Russia sufficiently), the carbon tax will make clean energy more competitive. I personally think that OPEC is shooting themselves in the foot over the long term with this move.",1417672704

I don&#x27;t need prices to be constant for days, I&#x27;d just like them to be fixed at the moment both sides agree to the transaction.<p>It seems like that should be doable with current tech, without even affecting the price of many transactions (except the ones where drivers are going intentionally slowly).<p>The inputs for Uber&#x27;s pricing are time, distance, and the demand multiplier. Google maps does a pretty good job at giving an expected time and distance for a driver taking the ideal route. The driver / Uber can toss in a demand multiplier. If we agree that the Google Maps (or some other mapping service) time estimate is &quot;close enough,&quot; then we should be able to calculate the fee before I sit down.<p>The driver can then feel free to take a scenic route, but it comes out of their pocket, not mine, so they probably won&#x27;t.<p>Or we can do nothing.

Alas, they did not do this, because the success of the ipod was predicated on widespread copyright infringement. Who would pay 350$+ for a music player if they had to pay for all the music too? No, this was a simple case of keeping the record companies happy with the DRM scheme.

One is to have it sync to a computer.  This is what you have done.  Yes, it&#x27;s set to sync to a particular computer, and you can change that computer—but with this setup, the contents of the iOS device are just a copy of what&#x27;s on the computer, so if you change the computer, it replaces the files on the device.  Generally, it&#x27;s not a great way to go, it&#x27;s mostly a holdover from early iPod days.  Second is to <i>not</i> have it sync to a computer.  If you have more than one computer—or no computers with iTunes, this is a better idea.

The common response involving phrases like &quot;we are working closely with law enforcement&quot;[0] might assuage most laypeople, but this canned answer is not satisfying for the technical crowd who understand how challenging infosec is.<p>Unfortunately, operational security is a critical aspect of respecting customer privacy, and the bar is not very high at many companies where the standard response is anything less than rebuilding from the ground up. Obviously, most companies do not do that, even after a severe intrusion. That is not practical unless your infrastructure allows (cold backups, all workstations are thin clients or easily flashed, etc.), so there&#x27;s really no way to go &quot;above and beyond&quot; other companies in that aspect.<p>So really, what we are left with is: since we can&#x27;t trust any given company to have complete omnipotence and control over its network, especially where many networks may be covertly compromised[1], what is a company to do from a PR perspective in order to assure users that doing business with them is no more harmful than doing business with another company?<p>If I were faced with this question in a vacuum, I would have to concede that I couldn&#x27;t fault Sony for having been hacked - it could happen to any company, respectable or not. But we&#x27;re not in a vacuum.<p>> [Sony&#x27;s past behavior] raises the question though, what would it take for a company with a reputation as tarnished as Sony&#x27;s to earn back your respect and patronage?<p>Sony is actively hostile to the consumer[2][3] and operationally negligent[4]. Full stop. Quite frankly, these behaviors are inexcusable and it would take a massive organizational change for me to even consider patronizing Sony[5]. Their attitude towards their customers is completely orthogonal to how a company should behave - at this point, it&#x27;s not constructive for me to rant, so I will spare the rest of my opinion. But when a company is inevitably compromised and realizes it needs to regain the trust of its customers and partners, its past will precede it, and in this case Sony&#x27;s past precludes forgiveness.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/sony-execs-hack-response-employee-memo-2014-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/sony-execs-hack-response-empl...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/critical-networks-in-us-15-nations-completely-owned-by-iran-backed-hackers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/12/critical-networks-in...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtherOS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtherOS</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment_America_v._George_Hotz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment_Ame...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network_outage#Unencrypted_personal_details"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network_outage#Unen...</a><p>[5] I feel that your question may be hitting on &quot;what exactly would that organizational change have to be?&quot; - if this is the case, I couldn&#x27;t tell you.

I&#x27;d also like to see more companies active in areas where they contribute to open-source ecosystems, have bug bounties, encourage tinkerers to hack on their hardware and developers to modulate their software, the list goes on.

When doing further processing, some plugins sound better with their algorithms taking 96k instead of 44k. Every plugin has been written with compromises. And I find I can push hires audio further in the digital domain before unpleasant artefacts arise.<p>It&#x27;s very much like image processing. If you take a picture with a cheap basic 1 mega pixel camera and then play with the curves and sharpness, at a certain point smooth graduated colour becomes &quot;posterised&quot;. If you take the shot with a DSLR (with 12 bits of each primary colour) then you can push the image a lot further before the posterisation occurs.<p>I have found the same occurs for audio. I can manipulate the sound with less artefacts when its hires. The plugins sound more transparent and smoother. I tend not to go above 96kHz because this effect is achieved at 96, and 192 (to my ears) sounds no better and I&#x27;d just have bigger files and more CPU load from the plugins processing the extra data.<p>The bandwidth of 96kHz is just short of 50kHz, so if as an added benefit I satisfy the one in a million Geoff Emerick&#x27;s, then all the better.<p>But then once the final mix is rendered and no more processing needs to be done, ie for distribution, then this hires advantage seems moot. Maybe there is still some advantage for people or devices that may post process the sound digitally in some way, like a digital equaliser in your playback device, or something like that. But then again, that device could always upsample before processing.<p>I tend to use 88kHz if the final destination is intended to be CD, and 96kHz otherwise (so there is less aliasing when sample rate converting to 44kHz).<p>The reason I harp on about the bit depth is because in my experience that is where we are falling short. If I take my hires sources and convert to 44 or 48 with a <i>high quality</i> SRC I hear no difference at all. But when I change to 16 bit the difference is enormous. There is <i>always</i> a degredation. And it&#x27;s never a good thing. It seems silly to just be throwing away that bit depth because of a 1982 format that people aren&#x27;t even listening on anymore.<p>Also on the topic of SRCs, this site has some interesting comparison. For the record I do my SRC conversion with iZotope RX 64 bit SRC. <a href=""http://src.infinitewave.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://src.infinitewave.ca/</a><p>So in conclusion, I want 24 bit tracks.

We&#x27;re talking 400x growth in the next 40 years[1].<p>So far, the solar industry has reached grid parity (i.e. unsubsidized costs <= retail cost from the grid) in a few U.S. states and several countries[2]. When it has reached grid parity in these locations, you see a huge inflow of investment capital since there&#x27;s little regulatory risk[3].<p>This trend will not change. Solar will only get cheaper, and fossil fuels will only get more expensive. So what happens in 10-20 years when solar is at or below grid parity in most of the world?

This sounds like an easy thing to implement, but in most languages it actually isn&#x27;t, because order of nested operations means that without being asked, it will evaluate it&#x27;s arguments before our and.<p>So we can write this broken-and easily enough:<p><pre><code>  (define (broken-and . rest)
    (cond
      [(null? rest) #t]
      [(car rest) (apply broken-and (cdr rest))]
      [else #f]))
</code></pre>
But give it the following, and you get an error:<p><pre><code>  > (broken-and (zero? 0) (string? &quot;dave&quot;) (null? &#x27;(is fat)) (/ 5 0))

  . . /: division by zero
</code></pre>
And that will work so long as all your args are valid. But what will work better is to write a macro. Macros aren&#x27;t evaluated, they merely splice in their syntax, but we can write them a lot like code, using all our control structures and so forth, and in Scheme/Racket, also some cool pattern matching stuff):<p><pre><code>  (define-syntax my-and.v2
    (syntax-rules ()
      [(_) #t]
      [(_ a) a]
      [(_ a b ...) (if a
                       (my-and.v2 b ...)
                       #f)]))
</code></pre>
Now we can try our input from before, and get what we want, because the macro expands recursively and won&#x27;t ever get to our divide by zero, at least unless all preceding args are true:<p><pre><code>  > (my-and.v2 (zero? 0) (string? &quot;dave&quot;) (null? &#x27;(is fat)) (/ 5 0))
  #f
</code></pre>
This property of only expanding, not evaluating, is why macros can write all kinds of clever control structures, because you&#x27;re mangling syntax, not evaluating code.",1417670094

It is present in every society to various degrees, and usually manifests itself in the incoherent tirades of those who almost invariably tout the benefits of &quot;tradition&quot;.<p>The idea that claims need to be backed up with evidence is a relatively recent and rare occurrence in human societies. It needs to be taught, and it&#x27;s often an uphill battle. In every &quot;traditional&quot; society, rote repetition is the most effective method of turning dubious claims into indisputable truth. The endless hand-copying of ancient texts in every medieval European monastery and Asian academy were not merely a low-tech way to make more books; much more importantly, such activities helped indoctrinate everyone who participated, both consciously and unconsciously. P is true because the Bible says so. Q is true because Confucius said so. R is true because, as the Dothraki say, &quot;it is known.&quot; What more proof do you need? It is fucking known. Anyone who says otherwise is obviously delusional, a menace to civilization. And so the Athenians killed Socrates.<p>And this is the fundamental reason why merely &quot;giving truth its day in court&quot; will not be enough to get rid of the insanity that plagues the politics of every country. People like Snowden, Assange, and Manning helped bring important evidence into the light of day, and even at this very moment, people are working to smuggle evidence into regimes like North Korea. But producing evidence is only half of the battle. In order for evidence to actually serve its purpose, people&#x27;s brains need to be wired to process it in the right way. We can only hope that <i>homo sapiens</i> has a natural proclivity to think critically, at least some of the time... despite a large body of evidence to the contrary.",1417669496

It&#x27;s more likely that this &quot;feature&quot; was a selling point for record companies, not consumers. Moral of the story: check who owns software before using it.",1417669495

While it&#x27;s not too complicated to set up Fossil repositories on the web, the Chiselapp &quot;hub&quot; would make it even easier and probably a lot more reliable.<p>One of the things to like about Fossil is its concept of record immutability, that is, data is retained intact in the database even when superseded by a newer version.  Fossil asserts a highly ethical position, that revising historical facts is not an acceptable practice.<p>Using Fossil over the last couple of years, its performance and stability have been rock solid, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any data loss or other problems with it.",1417669305

I see almost everyone &quot;carbing up&quot; before a show specifically because of this. It also means if you want to follow this sort of diet you&#x27;ll end up looking flat most of the time unless you leave the keto state.<p>Don&#x27;t really see the point going low carb if you&#x27;re lifting weights and calorie counting since you&#x27;re replacing muscle glycogen all the time, there&#x27;s not a lot of excess energy to be stored as fat unless you&#x27;re eating way above maintenance.",1417669229

10675480,comment,10668687,10668687,0,0,userbinator,,,"It&#x27;s always great to see more people writing their own compilers - a &quot;proof by example&quot; that compilers do <i>not</i> have to be magical and mysterious special software that only few experts can write. The theory may be deep, but in practice getting a basic working compiler doesn&#x27;t require all that much.<p>I notice you&#x27;re using a recursive-descent parser, which I think is a good idea because it can actually reduce complexity over one made with parser-generators; in fact it&#x27;s simple enough that even beginners who have just grasped recursion should be able to understand and write one. Once you have a basic parser that can evaluate arithmetic expressions, extending that to generating AST nodes and parse a (mostly) simple language like C is not so difficult. If I remember correctly, at least one college has an expression evaluator as a first-year CS assignment related to recursion. It&#x27;s interesting that one of the sections of K&R, on reading and writing C declarations, even contains a simple parser for them --- I&#x27;m not aware of any introductory books for other languages which contain small pieces of their implementation.<p>That said, you can use the &quot;precedence climbing&quot; technique[1] to collapse many of the recursive functions for most of the expression operators into one function with a succinct loop and a table, making your parser even simpler and faster. C4[2] is an example of this technique but with a series of if-else in the body of the function instead of a table, and I think is worth some careful study just for its <i>mindblowingly awesome ridiculous simplicity</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm#climbing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm#climbing</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8558822"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8558822</a>",1449223153

10675469,comment,10674526,10675337,0,0,danbruc,,,"Planck length, mass, time and so on are built from the most fundamental physical constants - the speed of light, the Planck constant and the gravitational constant - all of which are independent of the reference frame. But I don&#x27;t think that is actually important.<p>It has more to do with units, i.e. the concrete value of the speed of light is determined by the way we defined the meter and the second and the same holds for the other constants. But that has no physical content, the value 299,792,458 m/s is a historical accident and we could as well have ended up with 42 foo/bar.<p>So what physicist do is just set those constants to one and get rid of those arbitrary numbers by choosing appropriatei units, e.g. the speed of light becomes one lightyear per year. Because nothing moves faster than the speed you can then also go further and measure velocities with a unitless value as a fraction of the speed of light, i.e. a number between zero and one, as it it appears in the equations of special relativity.<p>So if you throw those constants together in relatively simple expressions like hG/c³ you again get one as the numerical value and here for example something with units of area, the Planck area. But there is also no real physical content in the Planck units beyond that.<p>Because the laws of physics usually contain all the constants and values in small powers and with small factor like a Pi here and one half there those units define scales of length, time and so on where the quantities are all about one, nothing is ten to the twenty or minus thirty. So at that scales the laws of physics may show interesting behavior like (1 - v²/c²) becoming zero as v approaches c but that are also more like heuristics than hard truths.<p>So to make a long story short, Planck units are frame independent because they are built from constants and they are nice to think in because many things are of order one - a black hole of one Planck mass has probably a horizon of one Planck area or four Pi Planck areas or something small like that - but they are not that special.",1449222877

In programming just like in mathematics, we are often more interested in how values <i>interact</i> with each other than with what they <i>are</i>. Short names makes the interactions easier to see, e.g:<p><pre><code>    diag_len = sqrt(w * w + h * h)\n</code></pre>\nIs much better than:<p><pre><code>    rectangle_diagonal_length = square_root_of(rectangle_width * rectangle_width + rectangle_height * rectangle_height)\n</code></pre>\nMaybe I have still not convinced you and that is ok.

10675461,comment,10675228,10675343,0,0,jalammar,,,"As a Saudi, I can vouch for the impression that a secular liberal government will probably not result from free elections, at least not right away. The monarchy&#x27;s internal policies have a lot to do with this state of affairs, though. Depraved as it may be, a lot of its internal legitimacy is derived from its appeal to the more conservative elements of its base under the guises of patronage for Islamic causes.<p>This has resulted in decades without freedom of speech or press. Up until the rise of the internet, the government had control of almost all media accessible to the population -- they controlled the newspapers (even hiring or firing editors), national TV/radio was a pathetic mouth piece, books were controlled/banned/censored, and even satellite TV channels were mostly owned by them when that started coming around in the 90s (the popular Arabic ones). It&#x27;s not until the rise of blessed Internet that some freedom of speech started sneaking in.<p>During this controlled period, you wouldn&#x27;t hear any points of view that are not in line with the narrow one adopted by the monarchy - Islamic=>sunni=>hanbali=>salafi/wahhabi -- meaning even alternative view in sunni Islam itself were not allowed. Let alone  concepts like freedom of religion or evolution.<p>It&#x27;s fast changing, however. 70% of the population is under 30 and the access they get through the Internet is changing a lot of their beliefs and values. They&#x27;re certainly the most liberal and open generation perhaps since the inception of the country. It&#x27;ll be some time until that manifests into policy, however (given the rigid/central system of government).<p>Edit: added last two paragraphs.",1449222678

10675449,comment,10675034,10675034,0,0,ipince,,,"Awesome, I didn&#x27;t know such notation existed.<p>I dance and teach (Cuban) salsa, and I&#x27;ve been wanting to write down a &quot;repertoire&quot; of moves that I know and teach, to give it some structure. Here the system I&#x27;m inclined to use:<p>The space of patterns/figures you can do in salsa is really not very big. You can break each figure into a sequence of positions at which to be on beats 1, 3, 5, and 7 (I guess you can choose higher or lower granularity, but I think this level of granularity is just right for most people). Then, in my mind, a figure is merely a directed path through a graph where each node is a &quot;known&quot; position (~20?). Assuming you know how to get from one arbitrary position to another one (safe assumption for anyone in an intermediate level), then you can just read and write any figure you want.<p>I think this kind of structure would allow students to learn much much faster (and is basically the method I used to improve my own skill very quickly, except I used a spreadsheet instead of graph). You&#x27;ll realize that most of the new stuff you learn is simply:<p>- composite paths made out of other paths you already knew.<p>- existing paths where you take detours and do something else in the middle. Those detours always start at a node, so now you can use the detour in any other path that goes through that node.<p>- new ways of getting from one node to another. Similarly, now you can apply this new knowledge to any move that utilizes that node, not just the move that you&#x27;re learning at the time.<p>Where I also think this shines is in developing the dancer&#x27;s (esp. leader&#x27;s) creativity, which I think is one of the hardest part for most people (technical stuff is easy, creative stuff is hard!). Having such paths laid out makes it really easy for someone to mix and match, and to create potentially endless combinations by simply choosing a different path forward once you get into a known shared position.<p>And for fun, I&#x27;m sure you could just draw out a random path and see if you can make it work into something that looks reasonably good :)",1449222317

Discoverability helps, by making it less likely for individuals to get lost and thus take up valuable commuter real estate, but without sufficient peak <i>throughput</i> it makes very little difference.<p>Not to mention that if station design does not accommodate for need to widen the tunnels in the future, they are not really aiming for future-proof. The only good measure for capacity is how many commuters can be moved through, and there is an upper bound to how many trains per platform you can fit in an hour. Once that limit is reached, the only way to further increase capacity is to get more people in per train. Hence: make trains longer (and extend platforms), or make them wider (which requires to expand the tunnels).<p>As for personal taste... I like Canada Water station. It&#x27;s utilitarian, can sustain a lot of commuter traffic going both ways and doesn&#x27;t even look that ugly.

10675425,comment,10675091,10675319,0,0,csydas,,,"While this is great for personal purposes, the article is discussing Schools/Google Apps for Education (GAFE). Chromebooks are nifty for the low price they offer and the relatively low maintenance needed on them, but this solution for privacy on them simply doesn&#x27;t scale once you get above a few machines due to the fact that you can&#x27;t just stick a live disk in and install, you have to go through a few hoops on the Chromebooks/Chrome Machines I&#x27;m familiar with.<p>GAFE is really convenient in a lot of ways; the EFF is absolutely right to complain though that there are a lot of privacy issues baked into the whole thing by virtue of it being Google Services.<p>Outside of data collection, the issue is that GAFE admins are still at the mercy of Google changes. We may get advanced notices from Google about changes and certainly some are optional, but things like G+ integration, Photos, and so on are completely outside of our control.<p>My last workplace used GAFE for the University, and we had a lot of very basic privacy things that popped up as a result of GAFE and new gmail features pushed out. Our few privacy minded users (mostly older professors) would get really upset over how much data got sync&#x27;d between LDAP and G+ without our admin realizing it, students who had legitimate privacy concerns (harassment cases) were frustrated with the same issue, and so on.<p>I&#x27;d like to believe Google could just ease up the data collection from schools and businesses - it can&#x27;t be that great compared to the public at large, and it would make GAFE absolutely perfect for schools. (Seriously, privacy aside, GAFE is otherwise perfect for a University set up. Unlimited space, great for student collaboration, and honestly many universities could do away with Office subscriptions at this point since the Google Office Suite is close enough for all intents and purposes.)",1449221820

You had grown men crying and falling off their seats during the keynote. Before native apps, before GPS, before 3G—the iPhone blew people&#x27;s socks and changed the world. The critics and skeptics were quickly silenced in 2007. People broke contracts and paid extra fees! People switched carriers and put up with bad voice quality and dropped calls to continue owning one. Millions put up with a slow buggy phone. People didn&#x27;t have buyers remorse and return it en masse—they bought a new one each year! Year after year you had long lines at stores on launch day.<p>Does anyone else not remember this?!<p>From comments online, I find it really hard to believe that the world has collectively forgotten that. Did I live in a bubble, or is everyone else&#x27;s memory of 2007 just way off? From what I remembered, it was outright mass hysteria.<p>The watch, OTOH, just doesn&#x27;t excite people the same way.

I don&#x27;t think I could design a worse system if I tried. Do you all just keep the system because it keeps so many people employed following the pointless bureaucracy of it all?<p>The people making the decisions have no training in law at all, yet they have to decide if the law was broken. They get a brief spoken explanation of the law, but only after they have been given the testimony. Why would you not have someone trained in the law decide if the law was broken? Why would you not allow the jury to interrogate the witnesses when they must bear the responsibility of the decision? The idea seems to be that random people off the street will somehow be more willing to consider all angles and if they disagree, you get another random sampling and try again. Try enough times and eventually you&#x27;ll get a bunch of people who are annoyed enough by being forced into jury duty to just agree so they can go home. Real justice right there.<p>You might say that the jury system allows for a justice even if the judge is compromised. But obviously it doesn&#x27;t - the judge controls what information can be fed to the jury and the jury must make the decision based off that evidence. If the judge is biased, the jury will be forced into a particular decision anyway. Why not just have the judge do their job and have an appeals system and punishments on the judge for bad decisions? And yes, that system works fine. See the current Oscar Pistorius trial for a working system (imo).",1449221733

But if your kite system only cost 10% of a traditional windmill then it only has to turn 10% as much as a regular windmill.<p>Assuming all else being equal, and anything that&#x27;s not equal will probably affect that 10%.<p>> Further, that&#x27;s before you start factoring in the cost of actually moving the power from where the windmill generates power to where people use power.<p>Agreed. So the cost of infrastructure needs to be added to the base cost as well and will be a factor in determining the economy of a particular site/technology.<p>>  I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like in Europe for sure (though from what I can tell there are problems),<p>Yes, but fortunately Europe is a bit more dense so the problems are there but not as extreme as in other parts of the world.<p>> But I can tell you that it&#x27;s a nightmare here in the US.<p>I know. I toured a lot of wind parks in &#x27;05 and transmission was a huge problem.<p>>  Dollars per watt generated are important, but ultimately what governs feasibility is dollars per watt delivered. If you have to spend $1b to put up new transmission lines to your $200mm ideally located, perfectly productive wind park, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.<p>Typically the costs of the transmission lines are borne by another party than the one putting up the capital for the wind-park but there is close collaboration between the two to make things work out. Also, once a park comes online in a certain spot the transmission lines usually have enough spare capacity once installed that other sites become possibles from an economy perspective so a follow-on investment in other parks in more or less the same location usually happens.<p>> If these kites are much, much cheaper than everything else you could end up seeing a sort of paradigm shift like computing saw; at first instruction execution was expensive and latency was &quot;free&quot; but eventually execution got cheap and latency got expensive. Is it a perfect analogy? No. But there&#x27;s some wisdom hidden, perhaps.<p>It all depends on practical deployment, environmental issues (they&#x27;ll be screamers with those small props), maintenance required, longevity and so on.<p>As to your edit: yes, that&#x27;s possible but they should make that very clear as it is the claim is just about meaningless. Someone else in this thread interprets it as related to the ability to function in a wider range of wind and so able to extract more power from a given site. But that&#x27;s not very convincing if they do because you&#x27;d need to deploy the unit side-by-side with a conventional machine and measure in practice including all downtime over a longer period of time whether or not this is the case.<p>And with the spacing being what it is this probably won&#x27;t work out favorably for Makani. Still, it&#x27;s a super interesting project.",1449220215

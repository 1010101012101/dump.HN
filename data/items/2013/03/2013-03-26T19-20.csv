5445666,comment,5445291,5445291,2,0,drharris,,,"Good article, but I'm even more skeptical of using LOC as a measure of expressiveness (whatever that means). I think expressiveness has more to do with how ""native"" a language feels to you. Just like a hispanic might think in Spanish, I think in English, and we are each more expressive in our home language. I would probably butcher Scala code, but a Python guy would butcher C#. I also think this metric ignores boilerplate code. In C#, I make a new class and it pre-fills a ton of boilerplate. One could debate that this is ""expressive"", but it's something that a native speaker doesn't even notice; our eyes ignore the framework and go straight to what matters. Same for long function prototypes and object types. We're not typing every line of code; most of them are typed for us.<p>It also ignores coding standard guidelines that many people follow, including hungarian notation, or expressive variable names, which can make lines of code get split up even though the naming conventions themselves might be considered more understandable because of it. Established languages are more likely to follow this pattern than the arcane notation used by most modern functional languages.<p>In the end, languages to the ""more LOC"" side of the list feel more native to me than those on the ""less LOC"" side of the list, and so I feel I'm more expressive in them, despite the statistic. I think LOC is not a useful measurement for anything, really, except for linkbait.",1364327595

5445660,comment,5441757,5445439,2,0,grey-area,,,"Re package paths, I guess the tradeoff here is for go get/install etc to be able to include or fetch dependencies, it needs to know where to put them and install them, and this was the simplest system they could think of which worked. Nowadays I think it's ~/.go/src/github.com/user/pkg rather than just ~/.go/src/pkg It would be nice to be able to specify goinstall and golib paths or something though, and I guess your symlinked idea is a good workaround. I have just gone with the flow on this one, and don't mind as don't have gopath at the root of ~/.<p>Re folders versus sub-packages, yes I take your point - again there are some conventions here they've tried to impose to make it simpler for the package tools, but those could get in the way. I also hate projects that have all the files piled into one dir, so I prefer to break into sub-modules where possible and make the organisation clear. The other advantage of this is that people could use just your sub-module if they want.<p>I've developed a few packages which I wanted subfolders for, but those subfolders naturally became sub-packages without much wrangling - seeing too many files on one level forced me to organise them and create more packages. One case for example mirrors your usage - a top level pkg, with interfaces and concrete types for specific databases, which lived in their own folder 'adapters' this became a sub-package, which contained the interface and concrete implementations, and it being a package forced me to remove any knowledge of the enclosing package and any circular refs - the top level pkg knows about the adapters, but adapters don't know about the top level. I felt like this was making the code better, not worse, by removing internal dependencies, but YMMV, and I can see how it would be annoying. I'm willing to forgive conventions like this if the tradeoff feels worth it (in this case I really like the go gettable packages, and to have that am willing to live with restrictions like some code must be in root, folder=subpackage, etc.).",1364327523

Or maybe the $500 was the interest, in which case your ""loan"" amount was $4167 (which, I'll just say again, is hardly an insignificant fact -- lots of people would <i>love</i> to get a $4k loan at 4% with a 3-year baloon payment!).

Since we strive to create a consistent Wunderlist experience for our users across all platforms, it was very important for us to have the Detail View behave the same way on Android than it does on iOS and the Web.<p>First, we tried to use existing open source code, but they just didnt offer the behaviours and quality that we and the design team needed. So, equipped with a big pot of coffee and a few long nights, we worked on what is now SlidingLayer. After the launch of Wunderlist 2 we received a lot of email from Android developers that were interested in the techniques we used for the Detail View element.<p>It works the same as any other container on Android. For flexibility it extends from FrameLayout, so its as easy as to drop it inside of your XML layout and so you can adjust the parameters as usual. You tap to open, rather than sliding and you can place it on the left, right or middle. After opening, you can dismiss it by sliding it away. To make things extra simple, we introduced an auto mode within the parameter that determines which side to stick your view to. For instance setting the gravity of the SlidingLayer to the right in any container or using alignParentRight = true from within a RelativeLayout will automatically stick your SlidingLayer to the right.<p>We are super happy to be opening it up to the Android Community and hope to see more and more developers getting inspired to use the component in their apps.",1364326382

A liberal arts education is not about rote memorization of facts, but rather about developing the ability to think, reason and write. One of the reasons that few people are able to educate themselves is because it requires intellectual maturity to stop, think and challenge yourself about whether your ideas are correct or not. It is very easy to lead yourself astray when you do not have anyone to talk to about your ideas. Most professors are not afraid of MOOCs because MOOCs are not appropriate replacements for what they do.<p>MOOCs are useful for learning material that would be covered in ""lower division"" classes, which often have little student-teacher interaction. Upper division classes require more student-teacher interaction, and research almost always requires in person discussion with a professor.<p>I think your attacks on unions and ""professional organizations"", as well as your view that they are ""afraid of competition"" is misguided. If you look at the countries that have the best secondary school education, you will find that almost all of them have very strong unions. In order to attract intelligent and competent teachers, you must treat them well. In the U.S, the smartest students do not become teachers because the pay is awful and the work is very stressful.<p>Although academia can seem very competitive (e.g publish or perish), collaboration is a much more dominant theme than competition. There are many environments in which focusing on competition is an inappropriate way of improving things, especially when the rewards are intangible. The joy that a teacher feels when she sees a student understand something and mature because of it cannot be measured in dollars, or any other metric for that matter.",1364325603

I feel they have painted themselves into a corner there.<p>> Re GOPATH, what do you mean here?<p>I mean that the ""go"" suite of build tools (build, get, install) rely on a specific convention: Your GOPATH is supposed to point to folders each containing bin, pkg and src subfolders with all packages.<p>Let's say I am developing a package A that uses my own package B. Both on Github. You're supposed to then create: $GOPATH/src/A (which contains A's files as immediate children) and $GOPATH/src/B (ditto for B).<p>The manuals I believe suggest that you have something ~/projects/go, under which you create bin/src/pkg and put your work. But I don't organize my home folder like that and I find it presumptuous that the tools assume that I do, so I have ~/.go, which contains bin/src/pkg, and I symlink stuff into ~/.go/src. Acceptable if annoying.<p>> <i>Re packages having one level - I actually love this</i><p>I want to use folders as an organizing unit, the way they are intended. It makes sense even for small packages.<p>Generic example (I have something very similar to this, but I don't want to go into details): I have a framework. There is a bunch of core interfaces, and then a bunch of implementations. Let's say that my interfaces are called Queue (with concrete implementations FooQueue, BarQueue, BazQueue etc.), Block (again, a bunch of concrete impls) and Stream (same). For my brain not go insane every time I look at my source tree, I want to have the core interfaces in the root, and then subfolders queues/, blocks/, streams/.<p>That's not much to ask. Putting these things in separate packages with dependencies on the original package makes no sense, in particular because the original package has internal dependencies. For example, the framework has a configuration builder that connects queues, blocks and streams, and it knows certain things about the implementations and how they interconnect. Putting <i>that</i> into yet another package is just insanity.<p>It's <i>one</i> package. And it needs subfolders. (Especially with how Go mandates that tests be in the same folder as the unit being tested!)<p>I have encountered lots of C projects that pile all the files into a single root folder, instead of having a src/ folder with appropiate subfolders by category. I think that's what the Go guys are mimicking. I hate it.<p>I mean, just the fact that a package needs the Go files to be in the root is pretty bad. I may have a docs/ there, a readme file, an examples/ folder, a locales/ folder -- why must the source files go in the root? They're not that special. I know you can import directly from a src, but the convention is 'import ""github.com/foo/bar""', not ""github.com/foo/bar/src""'.<p>As I said, I don't want Java-style nested package names. All I want is to be able to organize the <i>files</i>. After all, the location of the files doesn't matter to the compiler. (Java used to be like this at one point, too, unsure if it's still the case: What you put in the package decl didn't need to match up with the structure of your folders.)<p>> <i>Re the versioning, they originally resisted versioning the language</i> ...<p>Hope this will be solved. I suggest something similar to Ruby's Bundler -- don't make it part of the language, but part of the development environment.<p>> ... <i>as this is the stort of thing I hate even in the limited version they have</i><p>Agree, I would rather see no tagging at all, rather than the flimsy stuff they have today.",1364325471

This system is designed to try to prevent the government from overspending on software.  They can always point to a public RFP and open bids if anyone objects.  However, it is not designed to produce the best value for the state.<p>First the RFP has to be written, which itself is a very political process and may have been initiated by a contractor/sales-person convincing someone they need the software or process in question.  They'll often help write the RFP if you let them.  These RFPs are often signed off on by non-technical people who are not qualified to really understand the technical details.<p>Then the state has to get multiple bids.  Sometimes the RFP is written so specifically that many options are excluded.  For example, I've seen an RFP that required the state pay for the software.  The way it was worded excluded an OSS contracting company from providing support for a Linux solution.  A more public example is the LA School District looking for computers for their students.  They are required to support both a keyboard and touch, which is prime market for Windows Surface devices.  It could theoretically go to something like an iPad, but it makes it very hard for laptop makers to compete.<p>Finally the state is required to take the lowest bid that meets the requirements of the RFP.  To reject a bid the state has to show that it does not meet the requirements.  They can't simply take something that is better value, they have to take the cheapest solution that meets the minimum requirements.",1364325458

Of course use of automatic fire is discouraged <i>for situations where it's not effective</i>, such as engaging point targets with aimed accurate fire.  For other tasks, the most obvious being suppression, automatic fire can be very effective.  Capability of automatic fire was and always has been a requirement driven by the military.  For a recent example, look at the U.S. Army requirements for the individual carbine program - selective fire is a requirement for submitted designs.<p>Anyways, none of this impacts the fact that the term ""assault rifle"", as introduced with the German Sturmgewehrs and now subverted by the U.S. media to mean ""scary looking gun"", has a specific military meaning that distinguishes it from other small arms like the battle rifle.  Let's use Wikipedia's definition: <i>An assault rifle is a selective fire ... rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine.</i><p>The distinguishing features of the assault rifle, compared to the contemporary battle rifles at the time it was popularized (like the M1 Garand), is that it is chambered for a lower powered non-pistol cartridge (which translates into lighter weight), has a detachable magazine and <i>is capable of burst or fully automatic fire</i>.<p>I'm not aware of any military or paramilitary organization that uses a definition substantially different from this, or anything like the one you've suggested.",1364325329

I've been using Komodo Edit for nearly a year, and was quite happy with it as a Python editor. (Our build and test utils are all in makefiles and other scripts, so I run them on the command line.)  It's an all-around awesome editor.<p>I switched to PyCharm a month ago and am EXTREMELY  happy with it.  I have not touched Komodo since then. The ONLY things I miss from Komodo are syntax highlighting of $Everything (e.g. Makefiles, Bash scripts, Perl, etc) and the ability to easily open files from elsewhere (e.g. /tmp/foo.bar).  Both are things that Jetbrains have said detracts from their focus of delivering an awesome __Python__ IDE -- and I grudgingly agree. PyCharm is more polished than I'd dreamed - so much so that this is the first time I've been willing to spend money on an editor in over a decade.<p>If you already have an existing project folder, you don't need to create a new Workspace or Project -- just open that folder.",1364324645

The particular article was written around 2 years ago (April 2011 to be exact) when crypto was still a fairly new concept to me. As a result there indeed are some flaws with the article. Having said that, some extra explanation can't hurt.<p>> Example 1, regarding hashing something several times: ""In order to retrieve the original password a hacker has to crack multiple hashes instead of only one."" Nah, guessing is only more time-consuming.<p>I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say with this example. The particular list item was meant as one of the examples why I think people would do it that way. It's not too uncommon that I read some article about a developer doing that because it is supposedly more secure.<p>> Example 2, regarding the same thing: ""The first reason is pretty easy to bust: simply add more hardware (or better hardware) and you're good to go."" This applies for bcrypt as well.<p>Bcrypt introduces a weight/cost (whatever you'd call it) factor who's sole purpose is to prevent this. The higher the factor the slower the process takes. The nice bit about it is that with a weight of N the hashing process always takes the same (due to some bcrypt voodoo that is beyond my knowledge) amount of time. You also can't change the weight since that will result in a different hash being produced (it would be fairly useless otherwise).<p>Having said that, I agree that the article could've been written in a better way but it will remain as is, simply because I try not to edit articles after I've published them.",1364324622

There were lots of people who stayed with a company for decades as well as lots who jumped ship after a couple of years when their employers couldnt keep up with the salary escalation.  One or the big differences was that there were many more layers of management.  Engineers were reasonably well paid, but the salary range was fairly compressed.  In general the highest paid engineer could not make more than his manager.  When a man got a family and needed more money, he was promoted to a manager.  There was the HP Way where nobody was fired and engineers were taken care of.<p>While there were startups, there was not the froth of new ventures that there is today.  Finding a job was very much word of mouth, newspaper classifieds, and head hunters, not the easy searching of Craigslist of today.",1364324589

But now it is bringing back the noise. Partly because of this tendency that people must share and share and share, and share a little more.

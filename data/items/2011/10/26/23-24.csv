First, it can be an excellent business. You've created something to solve some problem or remove some pain that your company is feeling, it's extremely unlikely that your company is so unique that it's pain isn't shared by other companies. And it's unlikely your internal tools would be of no interest or utility to other companies.<p>Second, internal tools are typically of terrible quality. There are various reasons for this but it's a very common pattern due to fundamental pressures and incentives. By selling internal tools you force them to have owners and you force them to have a quality sufficient to be acceptable to the market. This generally vastly increases their quality, which provides a benefit to everyone who uses them, including you.",1319672655

An insurance company is required to hold reserves against losses.<p>At the time of the crash there was something like $60 trillion in Credit Default Swaps floating around.

It needs to be on the internet, and it needs to be easily accessable.  An exception can be made for classified spending in specific, but not so categorically (IE we spend X on classified stuff).  Additionally, just like there is a Surgeon's General Warning on cigarette packages, there needs to be a link on every candidates webpage that lists their top 100 donors, and what industry they are in.  This website URL needs to be easily visible and placed in every television and radio advert as well.<p>2.  Investment banks cannot also be commercial (depository banks).  Investment banks become partnerships where c-level owners are financially responsible for the actions of their banks.  The banking system survived before things changed from this, and it will survive afterward.<p>3.  There should be a small federal tax on the sale of any type of derivative, bond, stock, or other financial instrument every time it is sold.  Say $.10 per share, every time.  The financial markets are for raising capitol for companies, not for financial hackers to make money.  HFT is a waste of time and energy, adds unnecessary volatility, and has yet to be shown to be anything more than tangentially related to the goals of a financial security market, established for the purpose of raising capitol.<p>4.  The tax code needs to be simplified.  There are a number of ways to do this, but the end goal should be to end loopholes that allow companies like exxon to pay no federal taxes.  Or any company for that matter to realize losses in the US and gains in a foreign country.<p>5. Finally, there should be a 4 term limit on US Senators, and an 8 Term limit on US Representatives.

Going to meetups and getting immersed in the startup scene is great, but going the extra mile will have long lasting impact.  I am a non technical guy, but over the years, I have tried my best to learn code myself.  HTML, CSS, Ruby.  Just leveraging the vast amount of learning tools on the internet makes this possible.  Although I might never be an employable programmer, I have had a lot of great chats with developers on my own experiences and that breaks the ice and creates trust immediately.",1319670476

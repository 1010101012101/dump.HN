5386547,comment,5386204,5386444,2,0,wereHamster,,,"> Lua is a scripting language, perhaps a bit more structured than it's more popular counterparts (JavaScript and Python)<p>I wouldn't say it has more structure than Python or JavaScript. Lua has only these types: number, string, boolean, table, function, nil, userdata and thread. Table acts as a hybrid between list and map, just like Array/Object in JavaScript. And users rarely are exposed directly to userdata/thread, that's more something you'd use when you write a library (use userdata to emulate classes etc). The Lua VM is also much simpler than the other two, it's a simple stack machine. There are no tuples like in python, no first-class support for classes.",1363463985

Most Funding Agencies give away their money in tiny chunks, for short term projects, for individuals or very small teams. And scientific publishing has moved to publishing scientific advances in tiny bits, one paper at a time.<p>This works great for some things; but a lot of work is prohibited in this way.

I, however, highlighted the difference in his (commenters) approach with the approach of the author of the topic article, who advocates confiscatory taxes - because he's not content with doing something he thinks is right, he wants everybody to be forced to do the same.<p>As it often happens, first thing you do protesting stigmatization is stigmatize and paint me, protesting confiscatory taxes, as somebody who rushes ""to portray anybody to the economic left of Ayn Rand as a communist"" - despite the fact that I never said or implied anything of the sort.<p>The reason, however, why we don't see reasonable tax reform is, first, that current situation is hugely profitable for people in power - if you have power to grant tax exemptions, you will soon have a lot of friends who need tax exemptions, and these people tend to have a lot of money. If you make tax code simple and logical, you lose the power to regulate people's behavior (see how it comes back to where we started?) and you lose the influence and the friends with money. That's why we have hundreds of ""deductions"", ""credits"", etc. - because the government wants to control people, and when it can't do it by force of direct coercion, it does it by force of taxation. See the recent example of Obamacare - the fix to mandate the participation in the scheme is to do it through punitive taxation.<p>The second reason why we don't see reasonable tax reform is that for certain part of US political spectrum, ""reasonable"" means applying punitive and confiscatory tax levels on people that they do not like. You can not approach reasonable solution if you come in with hidden agenda and try to enact social-engineering agenda under the guise of economic policy.<p>The third reason why we don't see reasonable tax reform is that many view ""tax reform"" as a magic bullet that would allow us to get a free ride out of over-commitment on welfare obligations that our economy is unable to support. There's a widespread view that there's a huge amounts of ""wealth"" hidden by capitalists somewhere and if only we could tap into that hidden treasure all nearly broke welfare programs would suddenly become viable and sustainable in the long term. Unfortunately, this magic stash does not exist and tax reform would not fix the problem of welfare overcommitment.<p>>>>> The second Obama proposes something, it's communism, and there's no possibility for working with him.<p>This is pure organic bullshit. The problem with so many Obama proposals it's not that it is ""communism"" but that it stems from misguided idea that the economy needs more government-driven redistribution and that such redistribution makes everybody better off. Communists shared that idea too, but the problem is not in the communists, nobody cares too much what they think as they are largely irrelevant by now, the problem is that the idea is wrong.",1363461989

Right now, the mobile market is owned by Apple, Samsung and Google. They may partner with Nintendo, but on their terms, and always in control of their respective platforms. Furthermore, they don't actually need Nintendo, which means there is only so much concessions Nintendo could gain. So no, there is no guarantee that this strategy will do anything for Nintendo.<p>I do think however that Nintendo should have some sort of an app presence on mobile devices. Not necessarily putting marquee titles on the respective app stores (although, why not get some exposure and test the waters), but maybe experimenting with second-screen options for the 3DS or Wii U. For example, there is no reason why an iPad or an iPhone cannot play the role of the Wii U GamePad, or why you couldn't play (stream) your NES/SNES games from the Wii store to your android device.

I was thrilled to receive a letter from him a few months later...  the contents of which was a printout of my email, on which he wrote an explanation as to why I was incorrect.<p>Since <i>he</i> found a problem in <i>my</i> calculations, I promptly wrote him another letter (on the same paper he sent me), and mailed him a check for $2.56.  And he cashed it!<p>While I have yet to win a prized check from Knuth, this was a fun exchange no less.",1205891938

140437,comment,140287,140287,0,0,aagha,,,"I think one way to look at this is from an NPV (Net Present Value) perspective.  If you work on a project where your cost to implement it is $x, but the reason you decide to undertake the project is because you think it's value is >$x+$1 and someone comes and offers you (exactly) $x+$1, but still less than you thought you would get, would it be a good sale?  From a pure NPV perspective, if there were no other, better offers out there, the $x+$1 sale should be made.<p>The thing that really happens in life is that in addition to NPV, there's this little thing called pride, and when you think something is worth more that what someone else thinks its worth, it's sometimes hard to step back and say maybe they're right and I'm wrong.<p>Here's the thing to ask yourself: Do you think there's someone out there that will reasonably pay you more than the $x+$1 you have an offer for.  If so, hold out.  If not, sell.",1205891633

140433,comment,140285,140320,0,0,nsrivast,,,"Lee Smolin's grievances are motivated by a greater concern than simply lack of funding for loop quantum gravity, his primary topic of research. The main problem is the unjustified (given the lack of falsifiable predictions, lack of proper formulation, lack of unique solutions) and unprecedented (given the proportion of string theorists in top-level research institutions) focus on string theories in the current environment. It's about the fate of a discipline, not simply about ""not enough funding."" See his book <i>The Trouble with Physics</i> for a more passionate defense.<p>I do agree that the answer to ""why no Einsteins"" is more complicated that Lee Smolin suggests, though I doubt any of (a)-(e) are true, except maybe (a).",1205891255

I hardly ever write anything in Java now though, I have to use C and C++ in school, but for a quick project my first choice is usually Python, and lately I've been playing with Scheme.<p>Something I liked doing when I was first starting is to check out the source to some open source tool I was using, or just to some random project I was interested in.  I used to be amazed when I would look at some piece of <i>real</i> code and think, hey, there actually isn't some magic quality to it that makes it so much different than something I could write!",1205891190

140429,comment,140046,140322,0,0,hhm,,,"I do. In the past I worked on making a small team for my game development company, but with time I realized I was a lot happier working on the technical details of development than on team management and all that stuff. So I slowly faded to solo :) and I changed the profile of my company a lot too: then I was focused on developing games and related stuff for companies, now I work on independent tech r&d for companies. Working like that, I produced RV tech for advertising for Intel, some 3d and computer vision stuff, and nowadays I'm working on developing a massive video broadcasting software, to list some examples.<p>Working solo has many advantages and disadvantages... you get a lot more freedom, for one, but you also miss having an interesting team around you at many times. Also, you get a lot more responsibility on what you develop, but at the same time you can better choose what to do with your time. And your costs are a lot lower, so in some projects you can really make a lot of money that, at the end of the day, is almost all yours. And so on, there are lots of pros and cons I could list here from my experience with it.",1205891089

It was, in fact, the last suggestion of his, and (at least to my reading) least important.<p>The rest of his answer is quite reasonable, and doesn't even need new money:<p>1. Seek out people with different points of view and invite them to join the discussion. 
2. Give money/influence to individuals, not to large fiefdoms/research programs.<p>I think he is quite right on this. In at least one area the author mentioned (foundations of QM), even a single person with different views can be beneficial to a department. At Rutgers (where I got my Ph.D.) the math physics group has a single advocate of a deviant view. The department would be weakened if we replaced him with a normal scientist of equal quality.<p>Diversity of ideas is important, and we definitely don't do enough to promote it.",1205890234

Higher end for smaller and/or targetted ad runs and lower end for large run-of-site ads. If there are a reasonable number of relevant advertisers on google then it servers as a decent market sample.<p>Page views are the way to go because some of the ads you get from customer won't be good. I wouldn't look at committing to a significant campaign based on clicks unless you actually had the creative of the ads and had tested to see the click through rate. You are liable to get customers providing you with 'branding' ads that will achieve a very low clickthrough rates and return low CPM.<p>You have to consider a number of issues<p>- Commission and/or wages paid to the salesperson.<p>- Cost of chasing the ads, fixing their mistakes, and putting the ads up.<p>- Cost of billing + financial transactions<p>- Reporting costs<p>- Cost of collection the money.

140405,comment,140287,140287,0,0,ericb,,,"This goes to an area where economics hasn't caught up to reality yet. If you watch Deal or No Deal, many economists would say contestants are making a mistake (being irrational, unlike the ideal homo economicus) when they accept a deal that is significantly lower than the average value of the cases remaining.<p>What they miss is that dollars offer diminishing returns at scale, so the decision is rational. Going from 0 to 100,000 dollars is very different life-style wise than 3 million to 3,100,000. Because those first dollars are ""worth"" so much more, and because the upside of the best outcome is not worth as much proportionally, the decision is  rational (although people are often being irrational in other ways in this game).<p>In your case, I suggest you consider your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) and estimate their interest, then consider countering. You can only negotiate your ""best deal"" when you're willing to walk away.
If you're not willing to walk, you play it safe and ""make a deal.""<p>Edit: Keep in mind, if you counter, the worst they can say is no, and you can often still acquiesce to their original offer.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiate...</a>",1205889158

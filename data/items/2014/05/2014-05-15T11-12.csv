Or the tree with 4 vertices arranged in a T, which can&#x27;t be fit into a 2x2 space. If there is such an algorithm, it&#x27;ll have to account for the possibility that there is no solution, so I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be very efficient.",1400155199

In our context this would be impossible.<p>In particular, I was asked to help hire an algebraic geometer -- algebraic geometry not being my specialty. For me to read and understand the highly technical papers of each of 500 job applicants, outside my area of expertise, would take an astronomical amount of effort -- completely out of the question.<p>And not only that, but distinguishing thorny unsolved problems from fairly routine technical exercises is quite a challenge -- one reason that high-end journals solicit multiple reviews. It is sometimes possible to fool many (but not all) of the experts.<p>We rely principally on recommendation letters (generic, and submitted via a centralized system, so candidates can get one set of letters for all jobs to which they apply).

I have done that many times in the past. When I did my engineering here in India. Preparing for public exams, and entrance exams- I have regularly worked on subjects like Math and Physics almost 15-17 hours a day. Most of friends who cracked the exams did the same. It happens all the time.<p>I disagree. I spent part of my high school in India and I have worked on Indian engineering entrance exams. They did involve extensive amount of working through problems. There was more memorizing rather than abstract problem solving. I am not convinced the amount of clear headed thinking that was needed to perform practice drills on problem sets is the same as I need when I need to design something new or write theoretical proofs.<p>Not that you can&#x27;t go rage hard and convince yourself you can pull an all-nighter or whatever.

The problem is not the amount of payment or the type of payment, but that it is a sales contract (at least in Germany, every sale would be made via a contract, if explicitly written or not -- also a handshake could be seen as contract). And the law just says, how any sale contract must be made ... There must be a good visible button that clearly states the intention: &quot;Buy with costs&quot; or something similar. The customer must be very clearly informed about the sale and the fact that he is making a sale now. Your demo informs afterwards in a rather weird way. Just giving a link and say &quot;read further&quot; or similar would be accounted to be a fraud, I guess. I am also not sure that having a different text would be enough.<p>I am no lawyer, but one remedy could be to have some kind of &quot;frame contract&quot; where you buy an amount of readings in advance -- and the readings afterwards could be accounted for with such a system.

Just gives me a definition which I (probably) already know.<p>- Mentioning brands I recognise (Spotify, Pocket, Pinterest) is good. Makes me curious to know more. But I&#x27;m not sure exactly what a teardown is.<p>- Ahhh, so there&#x27;s a book that I&#x27;ll like if I enjoyed the teardowns. I guess I&#x27;ll look at a teardown and then maybe I&#x27;ll look at the book afterwards.<p>- Once on a teardown page (eg. <a href=""http://www.useronboard.com/how-shopify-onboards-new-users/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.useronboard.com/how-shopify-onboards-new-users/</a>) there&#x27;s nothing mentioning the book at all.<p>- I am now addicted to teardowns and have forgotten about the book.

Which is a shame because I think <a href=""https://www.useronboard.com/training/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.useronboard.com/training/</a> does a pretty good job overall.<p>- Completely ignored the Latest Posts bit at the bottom of the homepage.

He&#x27;s now on a Bortezomib cycle which will end in a couple of months and we hope to have some months free of meds again..<p>We never did the bone marrow transplant considering his age and stress/recovery he would have to go through.. MM is sympathetic in the sense that people who respond to meds can have a high quality of life even while undergoing treatment (my dad is still a practising medical Doctor). Lenalidomide is a tablet that you take at home while you go in once every week or two for Bortezomib shots.. The treatment is also considerably cheaper in India (still not inexpensive by any measure)..<p>The overarching fear for MM patients is the fact that its indeed incurable and how far/long we can go on before running out of treatment options..

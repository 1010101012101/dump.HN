His other comments are not relevant to the claim I am making, now that I've read them. On weapons grade plutonium, you are trying to put words into my mouth - I can make my own points thank you.<p>You seem to have some narrative built up of how the world will progress. e.g. pollution and energy use, what China is going to do, what would happen if they don't, what happens if nuclear power is abandoned, how China's economy will develop over the next few decades. And if you don't mind me saying so, you cannot see into the future, you are far too sure of yourself.\nCoal can be a lot cleaner than it is in China. However that country's disregard for its miners and workers, betrays a certain level of contempt for human life. Do you think that China will operate nuclear reactors as clean and as well as the rest of the world? Nuclear is not clean, clean is a classical propaganda term for nuclear, like pro choice and pro life camps in an American abortion debate. There is no rule that states pollution and energy usage reduce with better economies and technology, not for China, any of the countries you mentioned, not for anywhere.<p>I will de-construct Andi's comment that is so contentious for you:\nHere is what he wrote:<p>>>You are stuck in a view that energy needs to be cheap and that energy must be available despite the costs of nuclear reactors for nature and future generations.<p>The crucial words here are 'stuck in a view' and 'despite the costs of nuclear reactors for nature and future generations.'\nIt the phrase 'stuck in a view' links this sentence to the following one:<p>>>This is the classical view of people who see technical progress as a kind of god given fact or as the natural direction humanity must take.<p>Here he states that people 'stuck in this view' this 'classical view' see\n'technical progress as a kind of god given fact or as the natural direction humanity must take' and this is the crucial link back to the first sentence, because people are stuck in this view 'despite the costs of nuclear reactors for nature and future generations.' 'technical progress' here is dependent on the nuclear reactors of the first sentence.<p>This does not argue against all technical progress, it argues against ignoring the cost to future generations.<p>to be more specific:\nThis does not argue against all technical progress, it argues against ignoring the cost of nuclear reactors for future generations.<p>It's really telling that you berate me for ignoring Andi's comments while I go to look at them, when at the same time saying my claims have no support(in what way - you never said what part is unsupported?) and then informing me that you are probably going to leave the conversation altogether, and ignore my reply to you completely.<p>To reiterate: there is no forced binary choice to be made between living as luddites, and ignoring the cost of nuclear reactors for nature and future generations. Do you disagree with this statement?",1307184541

The big movements of big amount of people over the territories during the turbulent history are also somehow not addressed.

This would mean that the compiler generates a specialized function, say sort_{somerandomnumber} with the user-defined callable inlined into, and this seems kind of unlikely to me (while with templates the compiler is <i>forced</i> to do so).<p>In both your example the body of the caller (<i>array do</i> and <i>for_each</i>) is so small that I assume it is inlined.",1307183815
2619294,comment,2619088,2619088,2,0,dikbrouwer,,,"I see a few people suggesting that you start a new entity and have that company hire you. Be very careful about this since the DHS specifically tries to prevent this type of setup. In fact, it is very difficult for a startup to prove that they are a 'real company', and having paid employees, an office (pictures help), and money in the bank are almost a must. I've been through this a bunch of times (even with companies that have raised a series A), and it still took 4 months of writing letters before the case was approved.<p>Secondly, don't make the mistake of trying to hire yourself as the CEO/CFO/C-something, since an H-1B only applies to a 'specialty occupation' as was correctly pointed out. This means that it is much easier to convince the DHS that you are eligible for a visa if you are 'applying' as an engineer, product designer or what have you vs. a general management/C-level position.",1307183776

2619290,comment,2618316,2618495,4,0,extension,,,"My gripe with PE is that it's made up of specific cases instead of generalized problems. Sometimes, the solution that most people arrive at, and that is accepted by the judge, is one that fails in the general case.<p>For example, problem 13: <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=13</a><p>The easiest solution, and the one given as an example, is to truncate all the numbers and add them as doubles. But that wouldn't work with all possible inputs of a generalized version of the problem. It's not a very interesting solution either.<p>I think PE trains future programmers to ignore edge cases, which is exactly the thing that causes the most bugs in real world software.<p>EDIT: googling solutions to this problem that people have posted on their blogs, I find most fall into one of two categories:<p>1. Trivial solutions using a bignum library or a language with built-in bignums. These are correct but nothing interesting was learned by writing them.<p>2. Solutions that assert that the numbers can be truncated before adding, which works in this case but not in general, as I noted earlier. The really sad thing is that the people who solved it this way seem to be under the impression that this <i>is</i> a general solution. So the exercise has not only taught them to write buggy code, but has also helped them validate a false hypothesis.",1307183679

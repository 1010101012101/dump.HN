I can understand a decent amount and I can speak pretty well, but I can&#x27;t read much or write worth a damn, and my vocabulary is small. I also speak French, and learning to read and write took basically no time at all (just quickly learn some pretty regular rules, much simpler than English) and a lot of vocabulary carried over.<p>So in short, yeah, spot on.<p>I do think tones are a bigger problem than you let on. You can get by without them. I&#x27;ve met people who are pretty fluent except they just have no command of tones, and they can still understand and be understood for the most part. But the intimidation factor is huge, and even if you can be understood, people want to speak <i>well</i> not just adequately.<p>I think the language would be easier to learn if we&#x27;d punt on reading and writing for the first year or two. Every curriculum I&#x27;ve seen incorporates writing heavily from the start. As you note, it&#x27;s like learning two languages at once. That&#x27;s a lot of extra effort to put in! I imagine it would be much easier to learn these effectively-two-different-languages serially rather than in parallel. Attain basic proficiency with speaking and listening, then move on to how to read and write what&#x27;s already known.",1450277985

It defeats the purpose of having a strong type system if you can change the types like that.   Having a function which checks the type and gives an error if it&#x27;s not the type you expect is, I think, a better approach.<p>I&#x27;m still actively developing Full Metal Jacket.

It is also industry standard NOT to rely on FR alone; combining FR with other measures reduces the ability for a false positive.<p>The issue I find with FR is people expecting it to be some super technology, gleaming significant information from a dust spec. Its not like that. And the media is playing it up with unrealistic descriptions. Remember the original DOOM and it&#x27;s quality of graphics? That is where FR is now.

Of course, there will always be those who simply give up because they think their station in life is set. It&#x27;s probably more likely society and culture that keeps them down, not brain development.<p>On the other, rich kids have a skewed sense of need versus want, as well as effort versus reward. If everything comes easy, I&#x27;d argue rich kids are more developmentally challenged, possess less problem solving skills—especially under pressure—less able to deal with failure and less creative. Hence the &quot;spoiled rich kid&quot; stereotype. Whereas society constantly reminds poor kids all the things they can&#x27;t do, rich kids are constantly reminded that they can do anything they want. Even well-meaning efforts like the &quot;privilege&quot; comic strip a while back reinforces this meme.

Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit. “Such bad luck,” they said sympathetically. “Maybe,” the farmer replied. The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. “How wonderful,” the neighbors exclaimed. “May be,” replied the old man. The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune. “Maybe,” answered the farmer. The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son’s leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out. “Maybe,” said the farmer.<p>The point being that when you become so upset with being turned down for a certain job you are setting yourself up to be let down by missing the big picture. The reality of the big picture is you have no idea how something that might seem like a great success might lead to great failure, or great failure might lead to great success.",1450277556

Another way of thinking about it is our brain starts to associate things and if those clusters of associations that give those things meaning. The experience of experience and color is only important because experience and color has a web of other associated experiences that those colors remind us of. So extending the room experiment to the experience of a baby who throughout the entire life sees colors or the filter image version of these colors at various moments to associate with various things.

Reading Chineasy might help you get started won&#x27;t help much after that.   Alphabetic languages have at most a few dozen characters.<p>(2) There are no cognates.   German and Swedish, for example, have lots of cognates recognizable to English speakers.<p>(3) There are very few loan words.   There are lots of English words in Japanese, and lots of Japanese words in English.<p>(4) There&#x27;s a huge cultural gap.<p>(5) There are different languages all called Chinese.   Learning Putonghua won&#x27;t help you much with pre-revolutionary (1911) texts, as they were written in Classical Chinese.<p>(6) Unless you go to China, the Chinese people you meet will usually speak better English than you will Mandarin, so conversations will lapse into English.<p>On the plus side: The tones are the least of your problems, and pronouncing Chinese isn&#x27;t much harder than many other languages.   Chinese grammar is dead simple.   It has a fixed word order, which is similar to English, and there&#x27;s no inflexion.   I&#x27;m also told that once you know a certain number of characters (still several thousand), you can easily guess and infer unfamiliar words.   The Practical Chinese Reader series stops using English altogether once you reach Book 5.   (It&#x27;s been superseded by more modern texts.)",1450276740

You short the one you think is expensive and buy the one you think is cheap and hold them until the prices converge.<p>This has a nice risk management feature that the risk on both cancel each other out almost as if the markets move up, your long leg covers the loss on your short leg and visa versa if markets move down.<p>Unfortunately, partially due to secrecy(trying to hide what they were doing) and partially due to just who had the bond inventory to short from, they often ended up having the long leg and the sort leg at two different banks.<p>So to LTCM they were perfectly hedged, while to the bank with the short positions, if the market went up they needed LTCM to send them more margin.  So LTCM, which was already heavily leveraged was required to send their prime brokers margin that they never figured they&#x27;d need to.<p>Couple that with markets that started move in an unprecedented manner caused too many of their spreads to diverge beyond what they could cover.<p>The firm ends up getting a margin call it can&#x27;t afford, liquidates everything to its prime brokers and other investment banks and those banks end up making money off their trades in a time frame from 6 months (for Goldman) to 3 years for the longer term bonds.<p>Even when your models are right the market can still rip you to shreds:(<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i>\nAs to book recommendations below is a picture of my work bookshelf.

There are these stereographic images, where they put the left and right eye&#x27;s intended image next to each other -- and with a little practice, you can angle your eyes so each eye looks at a separate picture. Suddenly your double vision starts to make MORE sense than regular vision, because you&#x27;re now able to combine the two images to get a sense of depth in the image. The tricky part is now to focus your eyes; at first, you&#x27;ll reflexively correct your eyes too and the illusion (or the combination rather) goes away.<p>But bit by bit, you learn to control your eye&#x27;s focal length independent of &quot;where&quot; in space you want to look.

I loved MGS1 and MGS2, but MGS3 lost me. I really liked the video-gamey gameplay in 1 and 2, where each room is more-or-less a puzzle to figure out and work your way through, with the radar telegraphing the puzzle&#x27;s parameters. MGS3 made a major switch away from puzzle gameplay towards slow action, removing the essential radar and replacing it with careful player observation. The sniper boss fight was the epitome of this pivot, requiring you to slowly trundle through a huge jungle and look for a few tiny clues to find your enemy&#x27;s position. For better or worse, I just don&#x27;t have that kind of patience, especially when I want to be having fun.<p>I think it fits the style of the story more, and certainly it was well-received by players, but for me personally, I found it interminable.

I&#x27;m sure if they found any violation of the law, they would also throw in another ticket.<p>For those not aware, 15th St. abuts the White House and, because of the many roads that are permanently blocked off, it is not possible for there to be car / bike conflicts for a stretch of this street from New York Avenue to the Ellipse where the bike lanes end (though bike / pedestrian conflicts can happen), except with emergency vehicles and the like. The markings on the road make it unclear whether or not bikes must stop at red lights or just when pedestrians are present.<p>Because of this, the vast majority of cyclists on this stretch of road ignore red lights and treat them as yields since it is perfectly safe to do so. You will almost never see any bike stopped unless there are pedestrians crossing the street or the bike is turning.<p>As for why you rarely see traffic enforcement, at least in DC there is no traffic enforcement division. Virginia has traffic enforcement (don&#x27;t go over 80 MPH in Virginia on any road; it is automatically reckless driving, which is a misdemeanor. This applies even if the speed limit were 79 MPH).<p>Even without traffic enforcement of any kind, contributory negligence makes wearing headphones risky from a liability standpoint. Any minor law violation or safety hazard by a bicyclist can be used as a defense by a driver in court and end up with no damages awarded.<p>The saner comparative negligence standard does not apply in DC, MD, or VA.",1450274970

10744294,comment,10737058,10742099,0,0,EvanPlaice,,," In Java (and C, and C#, and a bunch of others), if your server has 16 cores, you will be running a single process on 16 cores and probably 32 concurrent threads, and they can all access some shared data (notably, database cache) with low intra-process latency, using some simple sharing primitives.<p>You&#x27;re right but there are downsides to this approach.<p>First, you&#x27;re creating a single point of failure. If any part of the application crashes for whatever reason it brings everything down with it.<p>If you intend to have fault tolerance, maintain uptime during updates and/or provide A/B testing capabilities, you&#x27;ll still require at least a redundant server and a load balancer to funnel incoming requests between the two.<p>Second, sharing memory across cores comes at a cost.<p>A simple mutex/lock strategy will work but will be inefficient as it blocks on both reads and writes to shared data.<p>You could choose to use a CAS (Compare and Swap) strategy to avoid locks altogether. As long as you can ensure your models as well as all of the internal data structures they use are immutable and thread safe. Considering the nested nature of OOP inheritance as well as language level access restrictions on classes/methods/members, it can be difficult/impossible to ensure immutability without hand-rolling your own data structures.<p>Third, sharing state across contexts comes with hidden costs that need to be taken into consideration. For instance, if the shared state for all threads is updated (ie a cached value is added/updated) it will invalidate the L1, L2, and L3 caches on the processor. The overhead of cache invalidation increases in proportion to the number of cores/processors involved.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/sharing-is-the-root-of-all-contention/214100002?pgno=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/sharing-is-th...</a><p>I assume you have experience with multi-threaded programming. I won&#x27;t touch on the transient nature and inherent difficulty in replicating bugs introduced in multi-threaded programming. Other than to say, I&#x27;ve done enough of it in the past to develop a very healthy fear.<p>-----------------------<p>What about Node...<p>You&#x27;re right to assume that Node instances will run as a cluster. Ideally one instance per core, to reduce context switching and prevent cache invalidations between the foreground and background workers internal to a Node instance.<p>As for a cache layer between the DB and Node instances. Since communication between Node instances will happen at the OS level via IPC, there&#x27;s no benefit to implementing a global cache internal to the Node application. Instead, it would be better to offload the responsibility to a separate service that is specialized for caching (ex redis). This reduces the complexity of the application, surface area for bugs, and development time.<p>Load balancing will be required anyway, so it makes sense to use Nginx. Nginx is much more fault tolerant, providing sane limits for incoming requests, as well as the ability to define routes that short-circuit requests to static files.<p>What&#x27;s interesting about deploying a Node cluster is its &#x27;redundant by default&#x27; nature including auto-respawning of cluster instances <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-cluster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-cluster</a>.<p>If you desire a more granular control over cluster management you could use <a href=""https://github.com/Unitech/pm2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Unitech/pm2</a>.<p>To make this work the servers themselves will need to be stateless. Which means, handling session management requires additional work-arounds.<p>-----------------------<p>Java is likely &#x27;faster&#x27; when deployed in a strictly vertically scaled setup. Node.js is more geared to horizontal scaling by default. Just like Java now includes good support for async request handling, I have no doubt the community will design tools that also favor scaling out.<p>Either way, I don&#x27;t think raw performance is going to be the deciding factor. Choice of platform is a business decision that depends on the resources and skills and/or preference of the team responsible for development.",1450274836

When I taught myself Isabelle/HOL a couple of years ago, there was a mismatch between the Isabelle/HOL system and its description in the old version of the tutorial you point to.<p>What was really hampering my grasping Isabelle/HOL was the lack of a description of the overall structure of the Isabelle/HOL system. In particular, there wasn&#x27;t really a good account that explains the distinction between the <i>rules of HOL</i> and the <i>meta-rules of Isabelle</i>, and how they relate. This is hand-waved away in the tutorial. Clearly the authors don&#x27;t want to burden the beginner with this material. Maybe that&#x27;s the right choice ... they have a lot of experience teaching  this material.<p>A consequence of this choice is that the whole tutorial did not (and still doesn&#x27;t as far as I can gather from a quick browse) include a complete listing of the logical rules (and meta rules)! As the structure of Isabelle/HOL and its (meta-)rules are not explicitly given, it becomes hard to see how tactics work. Under what conditions does it make sense to use tactic X or tactic Y or Z? Without saying what the rules are and how tactics work on them, how do you know how to proceed when Isabelle/HOL gets stuck?<p>If you stick only to the examples given in the tutorials and in &quot;Concrete Semantics&quot; this is not so much of a problem, but as soon as you work on your own proofs, you are your own.

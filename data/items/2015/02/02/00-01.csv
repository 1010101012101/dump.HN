In which case they totally don&#x27;t work together and you would get really weird numbers.<p>Would a more logical explanation not be that our current theories are likely to be flawed, just like Newton&#x27;s theory about gravity was flawed (but nevertheless incredibly useful) ?",1422838760

To the point that maybe it should get more discussion.<p>For two, not everything can be a linguistic structure/syntax/grammar.  Often they are pretty good highlevel descriptions of what is intended.  Implementation left to the reader.<p>Which is ultimately the problem.  Two implementations of the visitor pattern may have made different trade offs for what they are doing.  Same for many other patterns.  Singleton is often itself used as a tradeoff in terms of flexibility.<p>Now, I fully agree that when used without thinking/acknowledging the tradeoffs, they lead to issues.  They are not unique here.  Consider actors.  Arguably the vogue pattern for the popular crowd nowdays.  Can you honestly tell me the vanilla actor is a solid win?",1422838711
8982301,comment,8979620,8982132,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"> memory safety constituted material support of terrorism.<p>I love this. Not the terrorism charge per-se, but the general idea. Using unsafe code should be shunned, in general. After Rust 1.0 or so, any new C projects, especially for people not heavily invested in C, should be met with questioning.<p>I&#x27;m looking at this one project, mostly PHP. But they need some socket and packet handling, and they wrote it in C. Complete with lines like:<p><pre><code>  thing = malloc(somesize); // gets memory\n  ...\n  free(thing); // give memory back\n</code></pre>\nAnd network-connected string parsing galore. Or a million line project, used in many networks, compete with its own hacked up XML processor, that has never issued a security advisory. I&#x27;m looking forward to a time when the choice to use C here would be questioned and viewed with a doubtful eye by everyone.<p>Propaganda similar to &quot;loose lips sink ships&quot;, aimed at memory unsafe code, might help achieve that goal.",1422838710

It&#x27;s like the Goldilocks story -- tweak any of them to any other value and all matter would either repel into an nearly empty space or attract into one mass that would collapse under it&#x27;s own density.

8982293,comment,8982013,8982013,0,0,nadams,,,"> great free StartSSL<p>It looks like they cleaned up their forums from when they were last mentioned[1] but I&#x27;ll still keep my distance.<p>Anything like this is really a bandaid for the real problem with SSL/CA. As in why can&#x27;t I be a CA for my own domain? I think Android is a perfect example of this problem - if you import a CA cert using the built in Android credential storage every time you reboot it will show a vague and useless message saying that people may be spying on you. Not which CA cert was added and when - just &quot;hey, you added, on purpose, a CA cert. I&#x27;m just making sure you are aware of this&quot;.[2] I understand the warning? error?...err simply because now I can sign a cert for ANY domain and Android will accept it as legit. This makes sense for the average users who don&#x27;t understand or care what a CA is, not advanced users or enterprise users who will most likely use their own CA infrastructure. In this case - it would make more sense for them to be a CA over just company.tld rather than any domain.<p>Personally - I&#x27;m using a modified version of PHP-CA[3] (as in changed the OpenSSL defaults to something sane and fixed some small issues). It&#x27;s obviously not very advanced (for lack of better words kind of sucks) - but I wanted to hit the ground running with being my own CA for personal use and I have other projects I&#x27;m working on.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8901822"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8901822</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=82036"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=82036</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://php-ca.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php-ca.sourceforge.net/</a>",1422838434

Given the history of Hollywood Accounting, I think it&#x27;s also rational to assume that WB is trying to use legal loopholes to weasel their way out of obligations.<p>Absolutely. To argue otherwise would be anarchy. Can you imagine if some company bought Microsoft and decided to start fresh? Like discard all the responsibilities it has to support its software and such.

Rust&#x27;s ownership system <i>just makes sense</i> and seems to perfectly answer the questions I have when using C APIs. Rust, for me, looks a lot like what I&#x27;ve wanted when writing performance F#. I&#x27;d commit atrocities to have optional ownership in F#.<p>Every time I&#x27;ve fought with the borrow checker, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve had a serious design or conceptual flaw. (Well, apart from syntax/compiler questions). Since you can derive most of the rules just by thinking about it, I find it grows on you quickly. I&#x27;ll be very saddened if the borrow checker actually ends up being hurtful for adoption overall. Though I agree if you cannot handle pointers or think about memory, Rust will be difficult. So yeah, scripting only devs will have trouble. But! It&#x27;s better than them writing the code in C.<p>Rust overall seems like that. There&#x27;s less random stuff and things work mostly by thinking about safe, zero overhead abstractions, and what falls out from those mandates. Mostly.<p>Now, maybe if I was a modern C++ programmer, I&#x27;d find the effort about the same. OTOH, C++ systems don&#x27;t end up as safe as Rust ones, so I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a perfect comparison to be had. Maybe that&#x27;ll change as C++ has started catching up feature wise, but someone I doubt it.",1422838079

In the earlier project, Cuaron is alleged to have been &quot;attached&quot; to the project. In the WB production, Cuaron and his son wrote the entire screenplay.<p>The film term of art &quot;attached&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a precise meaning. &quot;Attached&quot; can be an indicator of someone&#x27;s commitment to a project --- a spectrum from &quot;aware of&quot; through &quot;interested in&quot; through &quot;attached&quot; through &quot;committed&quot;.

8982194,comment,8981690,8981860,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, some of the issues seem to be:<p>1. The movie &quot;Gravity&quot; is primarily an action/special-effects pageant about an astronaut trying to get safely back to Earth after an accident destroys the space station she was on. The book &quot;Gravity&quot; is a medical techno-thriller about a doctor in space fighting a disease outbreak on a space station. Reasonable people can probably disagree about whether the movie, given its significantly different plot, is even a derivative of the book at this point.<p>2. The lawsuit was not regarding plagiarism, but rather for breach of contract related to the film rights for the book. Gerritsen alleges that Warner Brothers was bound by and failed to observe the terms of a contract she had signed with a company which became a subsidiary of New Line, which in turn became a subsidiary of Warner Brothers. The court found that even if all allegations in her complaint were taken to be true, they still would not establish that Warner Brothers was bound by that contract. This mostly seems to depend on the arcana of contract law and how mergers and acquisitions pass obligations on (or don&#x27;t pass them on), and suggests that the main issue was either she or her attorney did not sufficiently understand those arcana (given that she apparently contracted for a percentage of net rather than gross, a lack of experience in what makes a good contract for film rights seems likely) in order to build a successful complaint.",1422835599

Then I got to the downloads. Great, an Ubuntu version... which is just the Windows version bundled with WINE except they modified WINE... and in the README they warn that it really only works with Ubuntu x32 and that you shouldn&#x27;t have WINE already installed. Right. Why they expect people to still run x32 in 2014 is a mystery to me, but these guys do. And I already have WINE installed.<p>At this point I started to feel really bad about giving this my root password (the readme said it would prompt for it), it all just sounds super hacky. Also the instructions to place it in my home directory... why, doesn&#x27;t it work elsewhere? What kind of epic hack is this? No, I don&#x27;t think I trust this with root permissions.",1415667587

8587653,comment,8584587,8584587,0,0,trhway,,,">The team concluded that a collision of two bubble universes would appear to us as a disk on the CMB with a distinctive temperature profile.<p>we don&#x27;t expect them to be real bubbles with real walls, don&#x27;t we? Thus, once the collision happened, the Universes get entangled, and, continuing the expansions, the matter/space from each other should continue penetrating deeper and deeper into each other (like 2 garbage trucks colliding in slow motion). So it should be not just CMB temperature disk - looking at that direction we&#x27;d be actually looking at matter/space from the other Universe.",1415667510
8587652,comment,8587379,8587379,0,0,kijin,,,"Okay, this is going to be controversial, but I have no problem whatsoever with moving people around like this, as long as: 1) the displaced people are adequately compensated for their loss, and 2) they are given freedom to move to a place where they can enjoy human rights and make an adequate living.<p>The right to occupy some specific geographic coordinates is not a human right.<p>This applies at every scale from a single building demolished to make way for a highway, to an entire country&#x27;s worth of refugees.<p>So the big problem is not that Britain evicted the Chagossians and is refusing to let them back. That was just a case of eminent domain. The problem is that Britain and Mauritius never properly compensated them and didn&#x27;t ensure that they could make a living in their new home.<p>If redistributing the profits from .io to these people would make goddess of justice smile, fine, let&#x27;s do it. But enough with the &quot;it&#x27;s my ancestral home!&quot; bullshit.<p>As the article mentions, the Chagossians weren&#x27;t even the &quot;native&quot; or &quot;original&quot; population of the islands. The French had enslaved them and brought them there by force, and the rest were migrant workers from India. None of them had any right to claim those islands as their home, except that they happened to live there at the time when Britain decided to vacate the islands.<p>In fact, none of us have any right to claim any piece of real estate as our own. The law, of course, grants certain people certain rights with respect to land, for the sake of convenience and economic efficiency. But morally, it&#x27;s all arbitrary. Why does it matter whether someone has lived on a piece of land for three generations or three hundred? What about nomadic peoples who claim a large swath of land but only use parts of it sporadically? Besides, virtually all habitable land on Earth has been conquered multiple times by different groups of people, all of whom might have some sort of claim on that land.<p>Whenever we hear about some group of people who complain that their house, village, country, etc. was taken from them, the location in question rarely has anything more than sentimental value for the oldest members of that group. What really matters are human rights (e.g. right to participate in the governance of whatever territory they happen to live in) and the ability to make a stable living. Without those, returning the land to them won&#x27;t make their circumstances any better. Nostalgia doesn&#x27;t put food on your table. On the other hand, once you have rights and a stable occupation, over time you learn to stop fussing about your location.<p>The idea that some people have some sort of god-given right to occupy some specific geographic coordinates has caused so much bloodshed, unnecessary grief, and opportunity for ideologues to take advantage of innocent people throughout human history. Can&#x27;t we just stop doing that already?",1415667510

That is, in the recent past, there were consequences for borderline behavior but the leverage of any single actor was no where near the leverage you are proposing.<p>If you read the wikipedia article, you will find that chilling effects are <i>not</i> only the result of vague laws and inconsistent enforcement but also the result of any legalistic behavior that might cause others to self-police or self-censor.<p>As for your assertions about universal surveillance, I find your position has a number of serious conditions:<p>1. It requires <i>total</i> surveillance of everyone.<p>2. It requires <i>totally</i> unambiguous laws and norms.<p>3. It requires <i>total</i> stasis of society.<p>4. It requires <i>total</i> faith in system by the governed population.<p>There are two major issues with this position:<p>1. Society must transition to this system somehow and survive.<p>2. People and systems in the material world are imperfect and we have no existence proof of any social system which achieves anywhere near the requisite levels of assurance.<p>I can only see this kind of system working in a society with 0 or 1 people in it. That is to say, I believe what you propose is impossible to enact by its very fundaments.<p>However, you continue to argue that attempting to create such a system is desirable. Due to this, I can only fathom that either:<p>1. You are a naive <i>totalitarian</i>.<p>2. You are a long-playing <i>troll</i>.<p>Because of this line of reasoning, I must conclude that the attempt to bring your proposed social system into being will not succeed and that the intermediate state will be much worse than the present state as totality will <i>never</i> be reached but concentration of power <i>will</i> corrupt.<p>If you insist that your proposed system is possible, how will you deal with dissenters such as myself who will refuse to live inside such a system? Doesn&#x27;t the existence of dissent mean that you cannot reach totality? Or perhaps you believe that such a system can be made to accommodate dissent? What if the resistance is violent? Should the surveillance state kill anyone trying to resist its total surveillance, total laws, total stasis, and total faith?

I have a history of mental illness and addiction, and my wife came within about 12 hours of death during a two month hospital stay earlier this year, so minor questions like &quot;can I receive appropriate treatment for a potentially life-threatening illness?&quot; have taken on an urgency that they did not possess when I was younger.<p>Is abortion covered?

So it continues to operate as a &#x27;private&#x27; airfield and you can only land with permission of the owner, or in the event of a declared emergency.<p>That said, the more interesting question is whether or not Google will build their &#x27;urban support area&#x27; which was basically code for providing housing for visiting employees (in the truest of &#x27;company town&#x27; sort of ways.) A number of people spend significant time working for Google as &#x27;visiting experts&#x27; (think professors on sabbatical) and that effort is hindered by the challenges of finding a nice place to stay, except there is housing for a few thousand people already at the airfield (formerly &#x27;base housing&#x27;) which could be repurposed for that.<p>Of course if they do that, then there will be a large inflated Google ball that will chase you down and smother you if you try to leave :-)",1415664243

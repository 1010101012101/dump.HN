I'm reading it like this: the new paint represents the growing neurons, and when the neurons grow that's increasing your potential brainpower.<p>The article says that you learn by pruning connections. I get the idea that as a baby you think anything is possible, and as life goes on you learn that trees can only walk in fiction, and when you touch something hot you get burned. That would be like removing paint.<p>But what I don't get is this: say you read an article about something you didn't know before, doesn't your brain make new connections (synapses) between neurons? How are those and neuron growth different, and how does the synapse learning fit into the paint model? Or am I misunderstanding how synapses work?",1260568536

I do wonder why is no popular blogger/journalist out there taking Fusion Garage's side and highlighting these points ?<p>These are entirely my interpretations and personal thoughts. Happy to be corrected.<p>- From emails its clear that Chandra is desperate, to be either acquired by Tech-crunch or raise some money. Poor guy is under loan, has to pay vendors, salaries. There is no contract because then techcrunch would have to invest and hence share the risks and put in some real money. If its their joint venture why haven't they done that ?<p>- Michael is aware of chandra's talking to other investors. He jointly owns the product, but wouldn't let his lined-up investors come and help chandra out. Doesn't he know that when investors come they do have some say in how company should run ?<p>- The blueprint shit. Come-on. I have a time-machine blue print. Anyone building it ?<p>- Michael says FG is in trouble, has no money even to defend lawsuit. Now if this was a joint venture started by Michael, how did it come to this ?<p>- Many are now suggesting Techcrunch to take their blue print and Crunchpad name and get the hardware done by someone else. Isn't this what FG did ? Too their hardware and got a new name ?<p>To me its clear that Chandra thought of Michael as an potential investor and discussed details hoping to get acquired. He also talked to several other investors, who agreed to invest under some conditions they deemed fair. Chandra, desperate enough, went ahead. Doesn't this happen all the time ? What's the fuss. Its only unfair that FG is being projected in such a wrong light.",1260566657

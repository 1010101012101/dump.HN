The article is about a wealthy guy who can travel the world racing cars.. who then got pissy at coming second.<p>The objective of a car race is to win.. especially if you have the best team and car. You should be somewhat dejected if you didn&#x27;t. It is the nature of competitive events.<p>This article has first world rich boy problems written all over it.<p>A far better example of this topic would be a friend of mine. He started his own business. Worked day and night to get it running. He always said he would enjoy the spoils of his work. He didn&#x27;t. He had more and more success but he got sucked into chasing ambition and achievement. He never eased up or stepped back. His life became chasing More. His wife left him. He continued to work excessive hours until he completely burnt out. It was only when he met someone else that he learnt to take a step back and appreciate and enjoy what he had created.<p>If i enter a race in my Punto it is going to be fun. I have little expectation of winning, I am there to say I did it.<p>DHH went to Le Man&#x27;s to win. He didn&#x27;t. This isn&#x27;t poisonous ambition. This is missing the target.. much like this article. If he went to experience it, got caught up in winning and didn&#x27;t enjoy any of it then perhaps he would have some sort of point.",1372107589

I think my default state is, &quot;I just want to be left alone&quot;, but every so once in a while all of the alone-ness (not loneliness per se, but all of the quiet and solitude and introspection and stillness that accompanies prolonged periods of being alone) kind of piles up and becomes too much to bear, and then I need to connect in some way with someone for a little while.<p>But, only a little while.<p>And, if I don&#x27;t get to make that connection, <i>then</i> loneliness sets in: the feeling that I am no longer alone by choice, but rather that there is something wrong with me, something that is off-putting to other people. Then, I begin to feel unable to connect to others.<p>It is a damnable thing. I have tried all manner of approaches to &quot;managing&quot; it, to make it less pathological, but in the end I simply loathe the company of other people right up until I suddenly am desperate for it -- where it&#x27;s too late and too difficult to get it because I don&#x27;t maintain friendships and relationships the way that other people do.",1372107551

People love to identify hypocrisy even though avoiding it has a habit of being wildly impractical. I think hypocrisy gets a bad rap. It&#x27;s avoidance is a common but subtle excuse for not doing shit that matters.<p>The idea that Snowden has only chosen to rail against the unreasonable privacy violations of the country he&#x27;s a citizen of, and most familiar with doesn&#x27;t seem surprising or unreasonable to me. The argument that if he hasn&#x27;t put similar energies into calling out every other nation that finds itself in violation of these ideals, then he must be lying about his motivation is absurd.<p>Also, he doesn&#x27;t say &#x27;you&#x27; can&#x27;t get a fair trial in America, he says that <i>he</i> can&#x27;t get a fair trial in America.",1372107544

5935620,comment,5935183,5935515,2,0,frossie,,,"I think the point is that Pandora acts as a discovery app. It plays you something and you think &quot;hey I like it, I&#x27;ll go buy it on iTunes&quot;.<p>Now I have no reason to believe I am representative (and in fact I would be surprised if I was), but 60% of the music I have purchased in the last couple of years has been as a follow-up to a Pandora play. Another 35% has been following a Shazam tag from a radio station, and about 5% from a movie soundtrack or something like that. Of those, Pandora is the only one that causes me to buy albums instead of solely individual tracks, which is an order of magnitude more money.<p>So I know for a fact that N artists got money from me that they would have never gotten if not for Pandora. That doesn&#x27;t help the (100-N) whose track played and I didn&#x27;t buy them; but, you know, I actually didn&#x27;t care enough to want to listen to them again. Or, Pandora played them while I had the computer on mute (played is not the same as listened).<p>Now the legitimate question is, how many people are like me, as opposed to people who use Pandora without buying anything at all as a result of what they hear? I don&#x27;t know the answer to that question and I suspect neither does Pandora (they have a &quot;buy&quot; button so they can presumably track that, but I only sometimes use it rather than just independently look for the artist on iTunes some later time).",1372107469

When it was announced that Snowden was heading for Ecuador, Human Rights Watch (among others) began posting to Twitter about Ecuador&#x27;s terrible record with press freedom (shortened: there is freedom of the press in Ecuador as long as the press isn&#x27;t criticizing the Correa administration). People immediate set about slamming HRW for drawing attention to Ecuador&#x27;s problems without accounting for every problem in the US.<p>Same problem: if Ecuador is jailing journalists, seizing their property, or even torturing and killing them --- all things alleged by human rights groups about Ecuador --- that&#x27;s a problem regardless of what the US is doing.<p>Similarly, if the NSA is unlawfully stretching the FISA process to surveil Americans, that&#x27;s something worth publicizing no matter how many journalists Russia and China kill.<p>I have a lot of the same problems with the Snowden story that you do, but I was disheartened to read that Carney had made that argument today.",1372107345

It does not require you to bind a sampler object in order to change the properties of it. However, the rest of the GL objects follow bind-change-unbind and a lot of implicit state which makes writing OpenGL libraries that can be reused highly weird because you never know what state some moron left the GL machine in.<p>Now GL 3.3+ is in an interesting position. They&#x27;ve got old functions that operate in a specific bind-change-unbind and new function that operate directly.

If the rate of pay was the same ($42/1M) it would have to be 35.7M listens. Well, at 20,000 radio plays that averages 1800 people per listen. Is the likely audience higher or lower than this number?

The simple answer applies to your selfishness: because you&#x27;ll be more confident in your dealings with others, you&#x27;ll be calmer, and you&#x27;ll sleep better. Knowing who you are and what you&#x27;re <i>really</i> playing for gives you a perspective that puts you above the fray. It lets you pick your battles. It helps you make hard decisions (particularly with relationships). Indeed, it lets you see your day-to-day struggles inside the context of a much greater goal.<p>The drawback to larger purpose, of course, is that it&#x27;s easy to lose patience with it. It&#x27;s easy to lose your way - to forget your purpose, and to get drawn into the petty, pointless status contests that dominate most peoples&#x27; lives (note that you may need to take part on such contests, but when you understand them for what they are, games, then you can get better at and win.)<p>The reasons living your life with purpose are better than without are much like working on a software project with purpose vs without. The latter is difficult, almost impossible, and extremely painful. Purpose in the context of software should be defined by leadership, and it can be very arbitrary.

5935526,comment,5933557,5935398,2,0,javajosh,,,">> &quot;why DO we continue?<p>> sheer curiosity<p>Curiosity is my #1 driving force. That is why I ponder questions like &quot;why do we continue?&quot; There is nothing quite like the sensation of &quot;clicking&quot;, figuring something out, attaining the ability to speak about a complex subject with ease. It&#x27;s wonderful.<p>And I discovered that curiosity itself is absolutely a drug. By itself, it is merely another path to acquire certain sensations - the sensation of learning, the sensation of innovating, the sensation of connecting the dots. Indeed, this is the drug that most people here share. Curiosity is another form of pleasure-seeking, complete with it&#x27;s own set of dark sides (the obsession, the depression, etc).<p>Curiosity, though, is the highest of the pleasures. It is the only pleasure that can reach beyond itself to the truly new. In my case, I was perplexed by the pointlessness of the world. All of the work in technology and science. All of the factories pumping out electronics and gadgets. And the question arose: what is all of that for? And even more simply, where does it all go? The second answer came first: entropy, war, consumerism. And it struck me: what a waste. Entropy cannot be avoided, but clearly mankind has excess productive capacity, and more clearly it&#x27;s being channeled into destructive purposes. We aren&#x27;t building monuments, we are building disposable goods to be burned up in the great bonfires of consumerist vanity and mostly pointless nationalism.<p>And the thought arose in me: we need, I need, something positive to work toward. We all need it. We need something positive, something lasting, something beyond ourselves, to channel our excess productive capacity into. We need to know that what we make won&#x27;t get burned up in a war or thrown into a trash heap. And what better option than an attempt to colonize other worlds? Here was a worthy goal, extremely difficult and demanding of us intellectually and economically. And if successful, would ensure that Life would live on no matter what calamity struck us here at home.<p>That&#x27;s how curiosity led to belief.",1372106492

AES will have 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit key lengths. This is far longer than needed for the foreseeable future. In fact, we cannot even imagine a world where 256-bit brute force searches are possible. It requires some fundamental breakthroughs in physics and our understanding of the universe.<p>One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)<p>Given that k = 1.38  10^16 erg/K, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2 Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2 K would consume 4.4  1016 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.<p>Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21  10^41 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7  10^56 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2^192. Of course, it wouldn&#x27;t have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.<p>But that&#x27;s just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 1^051 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.)

I reiterated that limitation how many times?<p>The core issue is not that I am not a lawyer (although I am not; academics were political theory; ditched law/grad school route for programming). It is, rather, that I used &quot;operates very much like&quot; in a way that would spur a lawyer to step in and want to quibble over words, without pausing to reflect on the context in which the &quot;operates very much like&quot; was made.

But if you want to see the game out to the very end and possibly learn something in the process, you should choose what you feel to be the best move. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you pick the best move or not, it only matters that you pick something you believe in. Similarly, in life, you do the best you can. You gather all of your facilities, your mind, your gut, your personality, etc, and you follow that path.

I remember when iOS 4.0.0 was blocked from the email service I was working for and many others because it basically spammed mail servers. A lot of our customers were mad that the software update disconnected them, but Apple released 4.0.1 quickly to address this.",1372104087

Given that three largely independent measures got to vaguely similar numbers, I&#x27;m now pretty comfortable that there must be between 1m and 5m Python developers, which was all I needed for my own purposes.<p>To stretch your metaphor to breaking point, pissing in the wind at least tells you roughly how strong the wind is (did it end up on my shoes, legs, or head?) and which direction it&#x27;s blowing.",1372104057

I was much, much, much lonelier in a marriage where love had died than since my divorce, though I was romantically &quot;alone&quot; a long time (however, my sons still live with me so I have rarely been literally alone).",1372104026

It will give you some historical context.<p>It is a difficult proof, and some of the underlying basic concepts are already deep in their own right, deeper than will be covered in an advanced undergraduate degree.<p>There are some attempts at higher level overviews on the web, and they are slowly getting fleshed out.",1372104012

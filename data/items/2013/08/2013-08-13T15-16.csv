This stuff moves <i>fast</i>, and I can&#x27;t imagine having to try to keep up with multiple larger platforms.<p>While we were getting Pathwright launched, we contributed a whole lot to boto, which is primarily (but not exclusively) catered to AWS. It grew Eucalyptus (not a huge jump) and Google Compute support, but they were badly documented/tested and still seem to see much less maintenance than the AWS stuff. The situation has improved slightly as Amazon has hired a few more guys to help the maintainer make boto awesome, but they&#x27;re still playing catchup with the core competency (AWS). This isn&#x27;t to talk badly of boto, it&#x27;s more to illustrate the magnitude of the task of keeping up with even one aggressively developing vendor.<p>I worry that these &quot;mega-cloud-libs&quot; are the wrong approach. The OpenStack stuff will probably end up with excellent support, but the others are likely to see much less attention, documentation, maintenance, help. The neglected areas of the codebase get to be embarrassing and not up to the quality standards of the primary focus (OpenStack in this case). Perhaps they end up falling behind in API versions for some vendors, limiting their utility.<p>This is definitely not to poo-poo the effort, I think it&#x27;s a really neat ideal. Personally, I&#x27;d love to see them focus on making a kick ass OpenStack Go API with top notch documentation and tests, and leave the other services to their respective communities.

It specially bothers me when I&#x27;m a returning costumer and didn&#x27;t receive any e-mails letting me know of a sale or coupon. This situation applies to other situation as well, for instance, think about the couple (or single person) that signed a contract to rent a place, has been a great tenant, and would like to renew the contract that is now ending soon. However, instead of the landlord saying: &quot;hey! you have been a great tenant, so I will NOT raise your rent (or as much), so I can keep your business for longer&quot;, he/she says (thinks): &quot;I know you like it here, so I&#x27;m going to stick it to you and raise the price of the rent, while new people who I don&#x27;t even know, will get a cheaper rate and possibly not be as good a tenant as you are&quot;.<p>Sites should definitely keep track of loyal costumers and offer coupons in this manner and allow one to enter then once logged in, but not trouble visiting costumers with this. Letting people know they could have gotten something for cheaper is usually a discouragement from click the &quot;place order&quot; button.

6206358,comment,6205885,6206113,5,0,zemo,,,"You don&#x27;t see it because it&#x27;s not really idiomatic Go code.  Another way to do this would be to define a type that is a function type, and then to put a method on that function type.  Yes, functions can have methods in Go.  This seems a bit odd at first, and it may not seem particularly important, but because a function can have a method, and an interface is just a method set, you can use a function to satisfy an interface.  A more idiomatic way to accomplish the same thing would be to define the argument function as it&#x27;s own type:<p><pre><code>    type AccessFn func(gophercloud.AccessProvider)
</code></pre>
so now AccessFn describes any function that takes an AccessProvider as its sole parameter, and returns nothing.  On this function type, define WithIdentity as a method (edited for brevity):<p><pre><code>    func (fn AccessFn) WithIdentity(allowReauth bool) {
	acc, _ := gophercloud.Authenticate(...)
	fn(acc)
    }
</code></pre>
Inside of the function&#x27;s method, you can invoke the function itself.  Then you would define the actual AccessFn as some variable:<p><pre><code>    fn := AccessFn(func(gophercloud.AccessProvider ) {
        // ...
    })
</code></pre>
and then call its WithIdentity method:<p><pre><code>    fn.WithIdentity(ar)
</code></pre>
And then, if you were so inclined, you could define an interface over your WithIdentity method, so that in whatever context you&#x27;re in, anything that has a WithIdentity method will do.  This often (but not always) leads to code that&#x27;s a bit easier to read.  Nested callbacks... not always the easiest to wrap your head around.<p>shameless plug:  I&#x27;ve written about this in more detail here, if this sort of thing interests you: <a href=""http://jordanorelli.tumblr.com/post/42369331748/function-types-in-go-golang"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jordanorelli.tumblr.com/post/42369331748/function-typ...</a>",1376408360

The overlap is that both Go and Erlang have lightweight threads. But Erlang uses the (fairly) different actor model, which usages messaging between actors, supervision trees to control and monitor the life cycles of actors, remote actors, etc. Go has lightweight threads and channels to communicate between threads. Go (concurrency) shares very little with Erlang.<p>It&#x27;s also funny that they move on to claim that Go has better concurrency support than Java, when in fact, you can use real Erlang-like actor networks in Java by adding one dependency to your Maven file.

Surely we have no tech to replace sexual reproduction. 
But we do have mental and intellectual capabilities to overcome such urges without any harm to our body.
I was trying to illustrate that while appetite might be something innate it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a perfect mechanism that we have to give up control to. 
Humans might simply have many instincts that are not that beneficial to us. It&#x27;s easy to make it into a philosophical argument/discussion.<p>//FOLLOWING IS NOT RELATED TO THE ACTUAL TOPIC, COMPLETELY SEPARATE AND SPECULATIVE<p>As for the particular case of sex hormones you&#x27;re right that we don&#x27;t have a solid solution yet.
But having said that many papers show that anti-androgens might not destroy male fertility even with long term usage.
Actually that research kind of helped introduce the chemical-castration penalty in many countries, cause it&#x27;s supposed to be reversible in terms of fertility (not to say it&#x27;s every single effect is reversible. 
The evidence is pretty strong, but could be better.
Other solution is simply castrating yourself after you have the number of children that you want to so that you don&#x27;t care about fertility.
For women I think it would be taking uterus and ovaries out. The thing is with women the life-expectancy might or might not be significant. But not having period would probably be nice.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t know. My gut feel on these issues tends to fluctuate. It&#x27;s actually kind of amazing - when you go and read actual papers and look for proof of this or that it often turns out nobody really knows.
The line between something being good or bad (for health) is so very thin sometimes.

If I remember well, the have a group of people (project managers, politians, you name it) preparing the case well before any actual construction work starts. Yet, as afar as I remember, there actually were some controversies when they started a TGV line somewhere in northern France. But it still works pretty well, one benefit of being highly centralized.<p>Another factor at play is that TGV lines are purpose built for high-speed traffic (curve radius, climb rate, ...) while for example in Germany they are mostly shared. That makes the single TGV track cheaper, but you still ahve to built another track for lets say freight. If want another track, that is.<p>But the cool thing ist that TGV don&#x27;t stop at every single village that happens to be the hometown of some polititian.",1376406479

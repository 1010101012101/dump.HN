Your use of the word seemed to be at odds with the part of your comment that claimed that it was not a strong critique.<p>The problem with synonyms is that synonyms are not perfectly equivalent, so you can use them to support a lot of false equivalencies. On the other hand, it&#x27;s difficult to capture subtle connotations of words in a discussion, and synonyms are kind of the best tool available for getting across that shorthand. It&#x27;s still a rather inadequate tool. I would say that &quot;disingenuous&quot; being a synonym of &quot;misleading&quot; is itself misleading, because the word &quot;misleading&quot; is neutral to intent where disingenuous is not.<p>Regarding the word &quot;critique&quot; (especially that form of the word, as opposed to &quot;criticism&quot;), I would say that there&#x27;s a broadly used academic usage of that word that contains no negative connotation.<p>Honestly, I have no problem with the word disingenuous. If you were saying that the site developer was intentionally misleading people, then I agree with your usage of the word. But the way that I read your entire comment led me to a different interpretation, and thus my comment.<p>I&#x27;m not asking you to censor your speech.

But the way that I read your entire comment led me to a different interpretation, and thus my comment.<p>P.S.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of people on HN use disingenuous in this way that is more or less a direct synonym of &quot;misleading&quot;, but outside of HN, I encounter the word much less frequently, and generally it is used in an accusatory tone. Of course language can mutate within communities and subcultures, and that&#x27;s fine, but using the word disingenuous without implying negative intent carries the risk of offending someone accidentally. I liken the difference between the two words to that of the words &quot;lie&quot; and &quot;misspeak&quot;. If you meant to tell someone that they misspoke, but used the word &quot;lied&quot; instead, they would tend to get offended and/or defensive, even though you clearly were not trying to hurl an accusation of ill intent at them. There would be some uncomfortableness created by the miscommunication that was completely unintended and unnecessary. That&#x27;s the reason that I spoke up about it. I see the potential for unnecessary miscommunication.",1379710791

It&#x27;s not too hard to imagine how the switch could have been smashed in such a way as to close its contacts during this event.<p>Also, do people really switch off their electric lawnmowers and root around inside with the thing still plugged in? Sounds like a great way to get an unnecessary amputation to me.

And when it became clear we were going to build systems with AMD parts those negotiations got a lot testier.

A doctor that makes an egregious mistake may well deserve to be ruined, as does one that deliberately engages in malpractice (in this case, collusion about the diagnosis, which undercuts the entire scientific foundation of medicine).<p>The problem is that so-called tort-referom laws protect the bad and truly incompetent actors just as much as they protect the good-but-unlucky ones. In the case we&#x27;re discussing here, all the economic risk has been transferred to the patient.<p>$250,000 is peanuts in medical expense terms, about the starting annual salary of a specialist and certainly much less than the annual salary of most surgeons or oncologists. So the doctor has perhaps 6 months salary at stake (leaving aside malpractice insurance for simplicity), whereas the patient may be facing an economic burden running into the tens of millions. A burden which you and I as taxpayers will eventually be sharing, when by rights it should have fallen on the malpractitioners, their employers, and their insurers.<p>For those who say that the insurance costs will just get passed on to the public in the form of higher medical costs, this is not actually the case due to price elasticity. In meantime, I can only advise avoiding malpractice states in general and Texas in particular. Txas likes to boast that licensing of new doctors has gone up by 25% since the law was enacted in 2003, but Texas is still ranked 46th nationally in terms of doctor:patient ratio, with only 176 doctors per 100k people instead of the national mean of 219.

In hindsight, that was the right time for RIM to acquire QNX and start on BB10, which might have done very well had it come out in 2011. With decent hardware, a solid OS, their own style and riding on BBM (big at that time), they might have staked a sustainable 10-15% chunk of the market.<p>The second chance was &#x27;10/&#x27;11, around the time of Nokia&#x27;s Burning Platform Memo.

Had they not done it, somebody else would have, with or without patents; it was inevitable.  It might have taken a handful of more years, but it was inevitable.<p>A crude though reasonable way to estimate how inevitable a development was is to look at the period of time between when the prerequisites for an idea were created, and when the idea itself was created.  Some ideas, such as the phonograph (which could have been created at least a few centuries earlier) have a very large span of time between these two things.  These ideas could plausibly have been &quot;missed&quot; if circumstances didn&#x27;t align.  Other ideas were devised shortly after their prerequisites.  Liquid fuel rockets burning LOX and LH2 were first considered by Tsiolkovsky just two years after hydrogen was first liquefied.  Goddard did not know of Tsiolkovsky but that hardly mattered, that idea was inevitable.  He, instead of Tsiolkovsky, went through with the idea.<p>In the case of the Wright brothers, powered controllable airplanes hit the scene quite shortly after suitable engines were feasible.  They deserve credit for being the ones that actually did it, but there is really little reason to think that there was ever a risk of a future without planes.",1379708337

Most Operating Systems ship with the IJG libjpeg, but a few have switched or are considering switching to libjpeg-turbo, a forked binary compatible library that has several performance enhancements.  One thing libjpeg-turbo doesn&#x27;t do though, is implement the DCT scaling functionality of libjpeg, which is a way of efficiently downscaling jpeg images without fully decoding the image (and of course has an impact on image quality as well).  The most important benefit of using DCT scaling for generating thumbnails is that it has much lower memory overhead.  Since you don&#x27;t need to decompress the entire image first, it can be done block by block, which means full-image sized buffers don&#x27;t need to be allocated (which is what Imagemagick will try to do by default).  Generating a small thumbnail of a large (10,000 x 20,000 pixel) image will allocate large amounts of memory, whereas using the DCT scaling option will allocate only small working buffers and complete much faster.  If you&#x27;re running an image processing server, these considerations are vital.<p>Long story short, if you stop thinking about your code at the level of the Imagemagick API (or whatever graphics library you choose), you can end up with more problems than you might realize.",1379707778

It is a valuable lesson to all about the importance of regularly scheduled backups.<p>Every industry experience ebbs and flows and though some cloud companies find themselves unable to compete, cloud storage is here to stay. This month Verizon reported that cloud utilization grew by 90 percent between January 2012 and June 2013, and that organizations are on average increasing their cloud budget by 45 percent per month. The same blog post indicates that only 38 percent of organizations report the use of cloud services today, with 80 percent planning on doing so over the next year. Credit to Arthur Cole for a great blog post.<p>While the cloud isnt going anywhere, the signal created by these shutdowns should serve as a reminder of the importance of backing up your data.  Many see the cloud as their primary back up option and while this can serve well for the most part, you can never be too safe with your data.  And we&#x27;re not just talking shutdowns.  Outtages can happen from time to time and if you need your files RIGHT NOW - you could be out of luck.<p>Some options to better safeguard your data include cloud to cloud or cloud to premise (i.e., your home or office) backups. The beauty of backups is that they are simple, and once set - so are you. Backups are insurance against the unexpected. Theyre your second chance. Your serenity while others scramble.<p>If youre looking for a secure, convenient, and fast way to backup your data, we can help with that. Weekends are the perfect time for a backup schedule, as people are likely away from their desks.<p>Mover specializes in data portability.

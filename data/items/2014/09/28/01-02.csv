8378716,comment,8376104,8378171,1,0,Mawilliams1215,,,"Thanks for the question! This will be somewhat of a longer answer since I will explain the market fit for us and how we support that with our platform.<p>Codeity is a talent acquisition management platform. We make the hiring process less painful for both developers and tech companies by owning the entire process on our platform from match to hire. As a developer you can signup in a few minutes, evaluate your skills, and then your profile is live. You can begin to see companies you are matched with after they express interest in speaking with you realtime on your developer dashboard. With multiple opportunities at various states in the interviewing process, your Codeity dashboard makes it easy to manage these from one point. There is no direct applicant process with Codeity, it is a one-time profile creation and then you are matched with job opportunities based on data points you identified in your profile. Our algorithms are always running so your profile will be continually evaluated against jobs as they are created and matched if appropriate. In a case of just taking a job or you would not like to be matched with opportunities, this can happen with a simple toggle within the developer settings.<p>On the company side we do much more and serve as not only connecting you with talent but also a toolkit to make the interviewing process easier. Once you create a company profile on Codeity, you can then use our job templates to create jobs. After a job is made live, we then match on various data points that the company can identify on a level of importance, etc. Companies will also have job dashboards so that for each job they create on our site, they can track, manage, and progress candidates through the interviewing process.<p>Within our company dashboard you will see matches in the first lane as developer cards. You can click on each individual card to express interest and also send prescreening questions. Once the developer is then notified that company &quot;x&quot; is interested in speaking with them they can then complete the prescreening questions and they are sent back to the company to review. The company then receives a notification in their dashboard with the answers and if they would still wish to speak with the developer, then they can use our scheduling calendar to get the developer scheduled for their interview. We currently integrate with a few different virtual meeting providers AND also have our own video chat so you can conduct a virtual interview within our platform in addition to scheduling. Follow-up interviews and rescheduling are simple and very intuitive. As candidates progress through the interview process we are tracking and collecting data points (time periods, progression points, etc). We also are working heavily on the analytics side right now with a few companies that use our platform so that reporting/analytics can be generated, providing the company with information unavailable on other platforms to make strategic hiring decisions more effectively.<p>In long form, I think that explains a bit more about the Codeity platform and how we differentiate ourselves from a Linkedin group and also other players in the space. We are not a public group/community of developers created for the purpose of recruiters accessing our profiles or contacting us, but connecting top tech talent with companies and making the hiring process less painful.<p>Feel free to shoot me an email at Mike@codeity.com if you have any other questions you would like to ask offline.<p>-Mike",1411869313

The point of this rationalization is that it shows quantum mechanics (or at least a subset of the theory) is mathematically simple, thus serving a threefold purpose:<p>1) Due to Occam&#x27;s razor, a simpler theory is more likely to be correct than a more complicated theory with the same explanatory power. If quantum mechanics can be expressed more simply, then the estimated probability of its correctness should be increased (by only a slight amount).<p>2) Quantum mechanics, explained this way, is interesting from a purely mathematical standpoint. Even if we knew quantum mechanics doesn&#x27;t describe reality, mathematicians (and theoretical computer scientists like Aaronson) would perhaps still investigate it. Of course, this may not interest physicists.<p>3) The article presents a novel way to teach quantum mechanics. Mathematical simplicity can (to some extent) replace intuition as a way for learners to grasp the theory. As Aaronson remarks, quantum mechanics is often taught by following the historical order in which the ideas discovered. Starting from the &quot;conceptual core&quot; (if Aaronson is correct about the conceptual core) is arguably a superior pedagogical technique.",1411867940

8378684,comment,8375502,8376768,1,0,Alex3917,,,"> Unless I missed something, it doesn&#x27;t provide a reason to expect bias in the other things.<p>&quot;VAM’s instability can result from differences in the characteristics of students assigned to particular teachers in a particular year, from small samples of students (made even less representative in schools serving disadvantaged students by high rates of student mobility), from other influences on student learning both inside and outside school, and from tests that are poorly lined up with the curriculum teachers are expected to cover, or that do not measure the full range of achievement of students in the class.&quot;<p>> If you believe VAM is unable to measure the effects of teachers, are you willing to follow through with the logical conclusions? Namely, the effect teachers have on students is so small it can&#x27;t be measured ...<p>We already knew that the contributions of teachers to student achievement was relatively small long before VAM was invented. The only people who seem to think that teachers have a very large impact are the pro-VAM folks (e.g. Bill Gates and Malcolm Gladwell), who all cite the same flawed study.<p>That said, the reasons why VAM can&#x27;t measure teacher performance isn&#x27;t because the contributions of teachers are small per se, but rather because there are all sorts of problems with all of the proposed measurement systems.<p>In order to create a VAM system that actually worked, assuming such a thing is possible, you&#x27;d have to make a number of changes to the way that the school system is designed... e.g. assigning students to teachers at random, designing standardized tests to measure teacher quality, implementing standardized tests in all subject areas, etc. But implementing all of those changes may well be worse for student learning than firing all the bad teachers or whatever. Not to mention that there is currently a major crisis in teacher retention, with half of all teachers either getting fired or quitting in their first five years. (After spending two years and god knows how much money getting their masters degrees to go into the profession.)",1411867907

8378676,comment,8376376,8377854,1,0,csirac2,,,"1) Since the mid-90s Apache and similar http servers have offered fastcgi as a way of communicating with processes with sockets. So you can understand why hearing you single out apache to &quot;use a more secure IPC like sockets&quot; detracts from the main argument which I&#x27;d otherwise agree with.<p>2) I&#x27;d wager that the people who came up with CGI initially had expected that the process apache spawns would be anything but a shell.<p>3) Non-shell CGI processes happily deal with all manner of binary, back-ticks, dollar signs etc. in their HTTP_ envars all day and have done so for nearly 20 years. It&#x27;s not a huge leap in logic then that these envars should be considered capable of holding arbitrary data without exploding.<p>4) You make it sound like nobody has considered environment variables a problem before, but sanitizing the environment before spawning a process from the CGI was already a well-established best-practice way before this bug came along. That process looks like - whitelist of envar names, remove all others; check PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH/etc sanity; command string parameters use specialized token substitution (eg. &quot;echo %{integer}%&quot; where some bespoke code throws an error if %{integer}% is interpolated to anything other than an integer), etc.<p>5) Despite the insanity of running CGI stuff which I would generally agree isn&#x27;t a great idea, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m allowed to be surprised that the mere content of an environment variable, whose job it is is to contain <i>arbitrary data</i> to be passed on to the CGI app should cause things to explode.",1411867753

Couldn&#x27;t you use a temporary variable to count the number of consecutive occurrences of the same byte, and then once you hit a different byte, add the total consecutive count to the appropriate slot? That way you only write to the count table once for each run of identical bytes, and you never write to the same slot of the table twice in a row. Assuming that the compiler can fit all the necessary temporary variables into registers, wouldn&#x27;t this eliminate the problem entirely? Or would this be so much extra work that the processor becomes the bottleneck instead of writes to memory?",1411866523

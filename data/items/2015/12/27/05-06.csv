Without getting into OS debates, this &quot;old&quot; machine boots up and gets my presentation to the projector faster than any off-the-shelf apple/MS machine.  5years is nothing for a digital machine.  Capacitors can and do last far longer.  They cost pennies, not even, fractions of pennies.  If iPads are failing because of such fundamental components then apple has questions to answer.<p>256mb belongs in the 90s, not 2010.  This machine came with 1gb and upgraded a couple years ago with a ssd and 4gb of memory.  And anyone who travels will tell you that having an oldschool VGA output is very useful.

10796579,comment,10795764,10795764,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"&quot;[...] Project, like many types in Roslyn, is immutable. When we add a Document to a project, we aren’t changing [the] project. We create a new one that can be accessed through the new returned Document. This snippet illustrates the example.<p>1 var doc = project.AddDocument(&quot;TestFile.cs&quot;, cSharpText);\n 2 Debug.Assert(!project.ContainsDocument(doc.Id));\n 3 Debug.Assert(doc.Project.ContainsDocument(doc.Id));<p>Roslyn confused me when it threw away my changes until I would notice the return type of the method and realize that adding a document doesn&#x27;t modify a project but creates a new one.&quot;<p>I love functional datatypes, but this is a poorly designed API.<p>First off, functional new-version operations -- that return a new instance rather than modifying the existing one in place -- should when possible be named with nouns or prepositions rather than verbs.  For example, the addition operation on Java&#x27;s BigInteger should be named &#x27;plus&#x27;, not &#x27;add&#x27;.  If you write<p><pre><code>  x.add(y);\n</code></pre>\nand don&#x27;t happen to recall that BigInteger is a functional type, it&#x27;s easy to assume that this statement modifies &#x27;x&#x27; by adding &#x27;y&#x27; to it.  But if you write<p><pre><code>  x.plus(y);\n</code></pre>\nthe name itself suggests that this is an expression whose value you care about and want to assign to a variable instead of discarding.<p>I would have called this operation &#x27;WithDocument&#x27; rather than &#x27;AddDocument&#x27;.<p>And secondly, having this operation return the <i>document</i> rather than the new project seems a bit weird.  I see the reason for it -- the new document object is being created at the same time from the source file supplied -- but it would be cleaner for this to be two operations (create the document, then create the new version of the project).  If that doesn&#x27;t work for some reason, I would use an out parameter to return the new document.",1451195335

That&#x27;s you breaking a screen. People like to talk about their mother&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s washing machine and how it never broke, but if you dropped it off a cliff it would break.<p>Also, a couple things I&#x27;ve read on reddit that made me rethink my thoughts on planned obsolescence:<p>It used to be that hardware engineers had to plan for errors in manufacturing, etc, and not knowing exactly how much stress this part would place on this part, and as such, had to over-engineer their products to make sure they would work. These days, we have CAD tools, and can almost exactly figure out how thick this particular piece can be to work, and exactly how strong that motor needs to be. Products aren&#x27;t over-engineered anymore, and as such will fail sooner.<p>Additionally, when your grandmother bought a washing machine, it might have cost a larger % of your income than now. If you scale the price of older machines, they&#x27;re significantly more expensive than what we have now.<p>Final note: You never hear about your grandmother&#x27;s stuff that broke now, did you.

In the past these notifications would arrive by email or I could check my usage by logging into the Bell site, either of which is entirely acceptable. However, in October, these notifications began to appear embedded into web pages that I was browsing, specifically in web pages that don&#x27;t belong to Bell and have nothing to do with Bell.<p>I don&#x27;t care that they provide a way to disable this, or that somewhere in Bell’s terms and conditions I may have ostensibly agreed to this action. They shouldn&#x27;t be doing this any more than the post office should be tearing open my letters to insert notices that they want me to see.<p>I wrote a complaint to Bell (and canceled my phone and Internet with them!) but they didn&#x27;t reply.

So, what people are actually saying is a huge-volume, low-margin ARM has better price-per-unit than a low-volume, premium-market alternative. No kidding lol. Even similar markets, the low licensing are why MIPS and PPC chips continue to sell at low prices even with lower volume. And SPARC has no such licensing if you do the core yourself given it&#x27;s a mostly-open ISA.<p>So, the comparison is apples to oranges in many ways. It would have to be on same process node, same clock, feature power management, high volume, and embedded board. Who knows what that comparison would be. This one is meaningless because, outside Leon&#x27;s, SPARC development focuses on servers with high performance for threaded and mainframe loads with inflated prices.

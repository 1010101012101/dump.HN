Banking is the classic (and perhaps un-expected) example. You can overdraw your account, there are processes to go back and solve conflicts. Some are automatic, some are manual some are legal.<p>Bitcoin at the blockchain level is eventually consistent, just wait 10 minutes or whatever the current time it (I don&#x27;t use it personally just know about it) and then you can be fairly sure of the validity of the transaction. There are built-in incentive to assure histories will converge. But, wallets kept at some exchange should _not_ be eventually consistent. Should _not_ be able to take 100x more than your wallet holds and send it to someone else. There is no regulatory, automatic of any other kind of framework to revert transactions that went through.<p>There is crdt (a commutative replicated data type) research. So these are data types that an always solve inconsistencies should they arise and instead of diverging they auto-converge, in face of conflicts. Think set union operation or max() function.<p>These kind of trade-off will percolate up through your data layer into your business problem.

I do wonder how much is covered by a slow-cooker though.<p>Going on the TM, my concerns would be cleaning (doesn&#x27;t seem like a big issue) and how much of a meal it can actually do.<p>With the Thermomix, we found it went from gimmick to regularly used device quickly enough - marinades, sauces, pureed baby food, mashed potato, etc. Besides weigh, heat, blend, etc it can also work to a set temperature (though with broader increments) and I eventually tried some steak sous-vide. Vacuum sealed bag, into the basket (to prevent the blades from rupturing the bag) and away it went. It worked OK though the steak obviously needed to be seared at the end. That left me rinsing the TM and still having to wash the pan/griddle, etc.<p>If you still need to prepare/cook your sides, I wonder how much time has truly been saved?

(I suppose you&#x27;d call that &#x27;gossip&#x27;). I also find often their opinions aren&#x27;t decided till they figure out everyone else&#x27;s, as if a fact cannot be correct until it is agreed on by other people. And when I speak confidently about a non-conformist view, they&#x27;re often reluctant to outright disagree with me until they&#x27;re sure my view is non-conformist, which might be weeks later when they suddenly bring it up (I assume after having quizzed all their friends).<p>I&#x27;ve been called a &quot;best friend&quot; half a dozen times by other men in the past year or two, but I&#x27;ve only got one best friend myself, who I&#x27;ve known for close to a decade, and we talk most days of the week. I think one of the most important qualities in a close male friendship is to mean what I say and say what I mean, even if no one would agree with me, even if it offends and hurts feelings. I think that is the stuff male bond is made of. It&#x27;s hard to feel closeness when a friend is hiding what they really think about me from me[2]. To maintain the closeness of a male friendship, it&#x27;s also important I put it above any romantic relationships I develop with women, even, and especially when, the women in such relationship puts pressure on me to become closer to her than to my friends. If I was &quot;Matt&quot; in the article, and if the author was my <i>best</i> friend, and a very important one at that, I would rather divorce my wife than move, if the move would endanger the friendship I had with the author. Only this willingness to sacrifice would ensure the strength of the bond in the friendship[3].<p>[1] I don&#x27;t consider any female as &quot;friends&quot; even if they think I&#x27;m theirs, because of [2].<p>[3] It is also my opinion that &quot;following&quot; my wife wherever she goes and agreeing with her every word would reduce her attraction for me somewhat. <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10524035/Happy-marriage-study-abandoned-as-husband-becomes-depressed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10524035/Hap...</a>",1398238067

I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be any more productive at four hours a day than I am at my current 2 hours. Some days it&#x27;s closer to 30 minutes. Rare days push 5 hours.<p>At no time am I ever behind on anything. I often solve problems without touching my laptop, sitting in my boss&#x27;s office thinking things through.<p>I talk myself and my boss out of anything that looks like work. (He never gets the hint and insists on working long hours. I&#x27;m gonna have to break him of that habit someday.)<p>Things on my end run smooth because code isn&#x27;t being committed every day and I verify that it&#x27;s working before I let it go. I happen to be a team of one, so this is easy.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that focusing on productivity is mostly a sham. Before you do anything, spend half a day thinking about the necessity of doing that thing, what consequences it&#x27;ll entail, where it fits into your overall plan, what you&#x27;ll do if your approach is wrong and you have to backtrack, ways to change your approach so it&#x27;s more flexible, whether you might be trying to solve the wrong problem and the problem you&#x27;re having is actually social. Nobody spends enough time doing this.<p>If you have to, use a checklist, and force yourself to do it before touching a text editor. Don&#x27;t think with a cursor and keyboard, guaranteed you&#x27;ll find yourself working prematurely. Better to fuck off than do that.

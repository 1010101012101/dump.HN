This fight is on-going and may involve one ad appearing on top, later underneath, then on top again, and so on.<p>To determine which of two overlapping ads goes on top, we would compare their current scores, where the score of an ad could be the number of visits minus the number of ""hide"" requests from consumers say.\n",1186275445

39441,comment,39398,39398,0,0,stuki,,,"	Seems to me, people are either of the kind that's happy as long as they have a cold beer and someone to share it with, or the kind that will always be sufficiently unhappy with what they have to bust their ass in pursuit of more.<p>	I suspect Silicon Valley, like New York, is home to an over abundance of the latter kind. While at the same time, those who can't understand continuing to work like that despite having millions, are exactly those that would never have bothered putting in the effort to get millions in the first place.\n",1186275277

Maybe, if the people you think are good but who join companies and give up startup dreams, or go back to school after doing YCombinator, then it means that you didn't choose the right people to run a startup for more than one year into the future?  Maybe they thought it was a way to fill the summer and pad their resume?<p>It's also remarkable how founding people over and over again who may not have ever read or followed any startup advice you've given but who have the same educational background as you or read both of your Lisp books, turns founders into tame animals... <p>It's tough to say it, but it's tough not to say it...",1186275039

Easy client-server communication on a desktop app for persistence between computers would also be nice.<p>There is something to be said for really peppy interfaces, rich input mechanisms (multi-touch, joysticks, gestures through a webcam), and compiled graphics libraries that blow our minds.<p>There is probably room for an open source system that uses a good languages, provides these capabilities, and could run everywhere. A model where monetization comes from support could probably work. <p>Something like QT is clearly not there yet. Doesn't actually run everywhere and C++ stinks.",1186274723

In most cases, it takes less than a full-time median wage 52 . 40 . 16, meaning I could do them working far less than full-time. <p>""making it"" is a state of mind. As is striving to reach an amorphous goal. Happiness research is perhaps some of the most useless work in economics because self reporting is so iffy.<p>If people don't feel rich, it has nothing to do with their absolute level of material comfort.

You might even have something left to give to charity.  <p>In Silicon Valley you'll blow your money on a huge house, a plastic wife, and kids who want a BMW the moment they can drive.

39433,comment,39389,39389,0,0,vlad,,,"I want to take a stab on solving the parallax between what the blog author writes (which I love) and pg's comment above (which I also love.)<p>Most YCombinator founders (and YNews readers) are young, and venture capitalists or techcrunch readers know this.  Every ounce in any skill set that shows we are competent helps sell us.  Anything, be it as little as a great visual prototype, helps.<p>On the other hand, this article discusses how the non-silicon valley customers, managers, and investors (even Microsoft) will confuse images with reality.  An even bigger problem is that the author assumes all programmers will be using a desktop programming language (with no frameworks) in most articles I've seen on that web site, not realizing that web frameworks allow anybody to have something up and running within a week.  I think this advice would be more true pre-Ycombinator and pre-web framework days (in 2004.)<p>I trust that both observations are genuine; and, on a personal note, I prefer pg's attitude more, because I like hearing when people denounce or offer alternatives to ""plan for the lowest denominator no matter what"" type of business blog advice.",1186274176

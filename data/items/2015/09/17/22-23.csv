Consider the old way of doing such things, where there was a queue to get to the taxis, but everyone paid the same price.  In that scenario the best measure of value is probably how long someone is willing to wait in line.  Now imagine that same queue except anyone willing to pay twice the normal cab fare could just cut in line.  Would you call that &quot;allocative efficiency&quot;?

10236571,comment,10225903,10235039,0,0,comex,,,"Yeah, I just made a mistake - you can increase the maximum number of mappings using /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count; I tried doing that and switching back to normal stack allocation (but still specifying the minimum size of 16KB using pthread_attr_setstacksize) and it doesn&#x27;t change the number of threads I was able to create.<p>...in fact, neither did removing the setstacksize call and having default 8MB stacks.  I guess this makes sense: of course the extra VM space reserved for the stacks doesn&#x27;t require actual RAM to back it; there is some page table overhead, but I guess it&#x27;s not enough to make a significant difference at this number of allocations.  Of course, on 32-bit architectures this would quickly exhaust the address space.<p>If increasing max_map_count hadn&#x27;t worked, it would still be possible to allocate stacks on the fly - but you would get a bunch of them in one mmap() call, and therefore in one VM mapping, and dole them out in userland.  However, in this case guard pages wouldn&#x27;t separate different threads&#x27; stacks, you would have to generate code that manually checks the stack pointer to avoid security issues from stack overflows, rather than relying on crashing by hitting the guard page.  Rust actually already does this, mostly unnecessarily; I&#x27;m not sure what Go is doing these days but I think it does too.  Anyway, given that the above result I suspect this won&#x27;t be an actual issue, at least until the number of threads goes up by an order of magnitude or something.",1442530273

10236541,comment,10236210,10236210,0,0,arturhoo,,,"I sometimes wonder about this very question from month to month and I always end up seeing Rails as a winner.<p>I believe the success behind rails and ruby ecosystems is due to the rails &quot;monopoly&quot; - it got so many things right along the way, from embracing REST, to migrations, generators, TDD, to the asset pipeline, turbolinks, supporting PG&#x27;s hstore and jsonb and so on...<p>And even if you decide not to build the frontend part of you application with Rails, it is still a powerful tool for building an API. After a few experiments trying to embrace a more domain oriented approach (largely thanks to Bob Martin&#x27;s talk &#x27;Architecture, the lost years&#x27;), I am both productive and comfortable writing complex business logic in plain ruby and attaching it to Rails.<p>And finally there is testing. When I need to move from RSpec&#x27;s powerful BDD capabilities to py.test (our ML algorithms are written in Python) I see how much more productive (and confident) I am writing Ruby code.<p>The article indicates that the next big thing in server-side development is Javascript, but hasn&#x27;t it been for the last 5 years?<p>First express, then the whole MVC moved over to javascript with backbone, angular, ember and meteor - but you still needed a server side API so at least the models and controllers were written twice (I still see the marshalling data in JSON as a &quot;V&quot;), and then came Angular V2 and before you even got the chance to play with it, you were using a &quot;useless&quot; framework. And then came React (which, btw is just the V, despite being (wrongly) promoted as an Angular alternative), but it doesn&#x27;t quite specify how to connect with the data itself so then there is Flux, and JSX and Babel, Typescript, ES6. And, let&#x27;s not forget the tooling behind everything javascript: node, iojs, requirejs, webpack, npm, bower (why are some packages available on both places btw?), grunt, gulp. And the cherry on the cake: no more REST, the next big thing is GraphQL.<p>I exaggerated on purpose, but as a software engineer who is not strictly focused on web development I appreciate being blindly guided by the decisions made by the Rails community.<p>It feels there is so much more serious/strong &quot;competitors&quot; for the next server-side Language/Framework duo now, than there was 8 years ago (Go, Javascript, Java8, Python 3, Haskell, Clojure, etc) - and from what I am able to keep up with, if I had to move, I&#x27;d go to Elixir/Phoenix, exactly because it seems to be fixing ruby&#x27;s major issues while keeping rails&#x27; excellent choices.<p>But this moment hasn&#x27;t arrived yet. What I&#x27;m looking for, before betting on the next big thing, is success, and as a @andycroll said: &quot;If scalability and speed is a problem, congratulations, you&#x27;re a success.&quot;",1442529794

Learning Rails is currently a very minor bump in the road, since (1) the language is easy to pick up, and (2) the framework is well documented (every possible question is on stack-ex it seems).<p>For now I&#x27;d look in the direction of Go, Erlang/Elixir, Clojure and Haskell as the new contenders for doing web development. They all have their own strong points, and I personally resonate most with Haskell (strong typed, manageable maintenance curve a.k.a. happy refactoring, fast enough).<p>So why not Node? It&#x27;s because of JS. The language is the biggest &quot;API&quot; you will ever write against. Moving away from it is called either a rewrite or a port. So making a choice for a language should be made carefully. And design choices when making a language should be made carefully.

Also the &quot;trust premium&quot; for certain professions:<p>&quot;the wages of labour vary accordingly to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen.<p>&quot;The wages of goldsmiths and jewellers are everywhere superior to those of many other workmen, not only of equal, but of much superior ingenuity, on account of the precious materials with which they are intrusted.<p>&quot;We trust our health to the physician: our fortune and sometimes our life and reputation to the lawyer and attorney. Such confidence could not safely be reposed in people of a very mean or low condition. Their reward must be such, therefore, as may give them that rank in the society which so important a trust requires. The long time and the great expense which must be laid out in their education, when combined with this circumstance, necessarily enhance still further the price of their labour....&quot;<p>Another factor, one Smith doesn&#x27;t consider, is <i>the durability of skill or ability within a profession or trade</i>. In the Tech world, state-of-the-art is <i>constantly</i> evolving, to the extent that professional obsolesence is a real risk. This is the case in other trades as well (Car Talk discussed this in auto repair som years back). But it&#x27;s a consideration not much weighed in the market.<p>Also cumulative stress and burnout.<p>Pricing these into the market is a challenge.",1442528354

Great, now I can make better (or slower) web pages and know JS - big deal. The purpose was to sit, and really learn all the core aspects of a given language.<p>This is mainly a matter of self discipline. This term I&#x27;m taking a C++ course at college. Skimming the book for the class, I already feel far more confident with the material knowing another language.<p>After learning one language I would suggest using that new skill set to reproduce some traditional software applications (Calendar, Calculator, Text Editor, ...). Additionally it would be wise to test how well you can read other peoples code in that language. It took me about 2.5 months to be able to work with JavaScript and the DOM effectively.<p>Also consider that compilation, weak/strong typing, data types, variable assignment, for and while loops, if statements and logical/comparison operators, and OOP exist in most languages. I found the key is understanding these topics in one language. Beyond that it&#x27;s a matter of adjusting to the syntax in other languages.<p>Overall, find a strongly rated book on language ______ thoroughly complete the material, make sure you understand it. Write some applications with it. Make the time to do all of this. A line of code a day, or 20... Read about the language with the bias towards learning. Drive yourself towards self learning all the time. If all this seems like shitty chore most of the time, re-think choosing programming as your career.

The issue is that we observe that all galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers and that galaxies merge.  Due to a phenomenon called dynamical friction, as the supermassive black hole of one galaxy passes through the stellar field of the other galaxy, its velocity slows until it comes nearly to rest with respect to the common center of mass of the two galaxies.  This leads both supermassive black holes to sink to the center of the newly merged galaxy and come into orbit with each other over a relatively short timescale (I want to say ~100 million years at most).<p>Over time, the orbit of these two supermassive black holes shrinks because stars wandering through the orbit get kicked out and take energy with them.  However, once the orbit shrinks to about a parsec, this process stalls.  All the stars that could wander through the orbit have already been kicked out and there&#x27;s nothing left  to shrink the orbit.  Furthermore, gravitational wave radiation is still too weak to make much of a difference at that distance.<p>Now, supermassive black hole binaries are rare, so clearly they end up merging somehow.  It&#x27;s just not known how this happens.  For a while it was thought that the last parsec problem could be solved by taking into account the triaxiality of the galactic potential [1] (and the references therein).  The idea was that new stars from further out in the galaxy would wander in as quickly as the black holes could kick them out and the orbit would continue to shrink.  However, new work seems to be casting doubt on this and whether or not triaxiality solves the final parsec problem is still being debated [2].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...773..100K"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...773..100K</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785..163V"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785..163V</a>",1442528197

Some may be large, while others will be small; there is no reason to believe economies of scale exist for protective agencies as they do for car companies.

Because there&#x27;s something wrong with your statement: it&#x27;s based on the assumption that all hours are the equivalent. But they&#x27;re not. The longer you&#x27;re at work, the more mentally fatigued you get.<p>How many times have you worked on something in the evening, only to come back at it the next morning with a fresh mind and realize previous few hours of effort were a complete waste of time, and actually a different direction was needed?<p>You need to step back from something in order to get perspective, both literally and figuratively. When you&#x27;re tired, nearing the end of the day, it&#x27;s very easy for your higher brain function to go to sleep and to start bulldozing your way through problems using willpower alone. And you&#x27;ll do a dreadful job.<p>Incorrect estimation is a completely different topic, because it&#x27;s a different mechanism at work. Presenteeism is a symptom of management&#x27;s inability to measure the productivity of an hour&#x27;s labour during the day. An hour at 5pm might be only 10% as productive as an hour at 11am, or it could even be net negative. Nothing to do with estimates.<p>Personally I believe I have between 4 and 6 hours of productive programming labour in me per day. I&#x27;m only good for meetings and occasional discussion the rest of the time. I don&#x27;t try and write any complex code past 4pm, because I know from experience I&#x27;ll write it much better the next morning.",1442527611

Bitcoin certainly counts as a &quot;non-government money&quot;.<p>Since money is used as a medium of exchange, it&#x27;s essentially a placeholder for your labor (when you receive it from your employer/customers as payment) or value provided to others. It is arguable whether society has as much right over an individual&#x27;s labor as he/she does, I think they don&#x27;t (while society may have a contribution, it might be significantly below 50%).<p>One last and minor thing we&#x27;ll have to disagree on: I don&#x27;t think government equals society.

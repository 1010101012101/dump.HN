1030917,comment,1030638,1030754,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> Everybody else is paying the mobster, why don't you ?<p>The patent system is set up so that innovators (like Nokia) share their research in exchange for a limited time monopoly on the fruits of that research. You can argue that the system is fucked up, but if Nokia hadn't been promised that monopoly, they probably wouldn't have shared all that research. They did, and now companies like apple can make phones with no need to do basic research, instead letting them concentrate on building UI's and such. This is how it works, and this is how every other phone manufacturer in the world is comfortable with it working.<p>> If Nokia had a leg to stand on they would have sued apple the day they first released the iphone.<p>Not only do they have a leg to stand on, they have successfully defended many of the patents in question in court in previous cases. And why didn't they sue earlier? I'd be ready to bet you a lot of money they have been in talks with apple all this time trying to make a deal without having to resort to a legal battle.<p>> I can't wait until we reach the 'lawyer event horizon' when progress outside of open sourced hardware and software grinds to a messy halt because all the time and money is taken up with lawsuits.<p>Or then, people who clearly use other people's research to build stuff could pay for it without wasting time taking stuff to court like <i>every other phone manufacturer does.</i><p>> The phone was an invention worth patenting, the cell phone is variation on a theme, and the research that went in to it was largely funded by the public.<p>The cell phone was not worth patenting? Please. There is ridiculously lot of manhours spent in thousands of little details that had to be worked out so that lots of people can be served over limited radio channels in a noisy environments. And, while it's true there was a lot public funding early on, there were also many private companies spending a lot of money getting basic research done, including, but not limited to, Ericsson and Nokia.<p>> LONG before Nokia got in on the act cell phones were a reality, it's true that the current crop is a serious improvement over what was available at the time but we're talking incremental improvements here.<p>Actually, Nokia has been in mobile telephony since NMT, and when things got digital they were on the leading edge -- for example, the first ever commercial GSM call was made on a Nokia phone in 1991.<p>> In the name of interoperability that stuff got standardized, after that point you compete in the marketplace, patents should get tossed out.<p>Or, people could agree on fair terms to licence each others patents like the cell phone manufacturers decided. Nokia pays other people for using their patents.<p>> Otherwise patents become a measure to control the competition instead of a device to foster innovation.<p>When you refuse to license them for reasonable terms, that's exactly what happens. Good thing that's not what Nokia is doing.",1262631373

If you call the police about a speeder, they'll usually look for them if they're not too busy.  But police departments would quickly be overwhelmed if they had to police ""every"" speeder on the road.  There's simply not enough police.  Also, you're defenseless while being in the presence of their illegal driving behavior.<p>Trespassing, on the other hand, is a rare occurrence.  Penalties tend to be harsher than speeding (jail time rather than a fine).  It must be much easier to speed than trespass since I don't know anyone I've met in the last year who hasn't sped, yet I can't pick a single trespasser out of any of them.  I'd imagine this is the same for most people.<p>People have little incentive to trespass too.  Why do it?  To steal something?  Murder?  Most people don't need to steal things or kill others.<p>Speeding, on the other hand, has a number of incentives tied to it which provide immediate benefit without significant perceived risk (tickets are rare - habitual speeders may only receive a couple a year | accidents are even rarer).  For one, it might save you time^.  It also makes people feel good (release of aggression, showing off, feeling of freedom, etc...).<p>My initial idea isn't one of punishment, but one which increases safety.  What's the goal of driving?  Going from A to B in a safe, efficient manner.  Why wouldn't you want it to be safer, within reason?  So you can cut 4 minutes off your 60 minutes of travel time?<p>^This isn't always the case.  Roadways are much like assembly lines.  Their slowest points set the pace of everything on the line.  Speeders mostly zip from one bottleneck to the next, never really decreasing their net travel time.  Time yourself driving the speed limit to work and back one day, and time yourself speeding the next.  How much time did you save?  A minute or two?  None at all?<p>NOTE:  Most vehicles already have governors which limit their top speeds, though aren't used in the manner which I suggest:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(device)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(device)</a>",1262630147

Some of my cohort continued onto the PhD - they <mostly> found employment in universities and research institutions over the last three or four years.<p>However, the Taulbee survey (<a href=""http://www.cra.org/statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cra.org/statistics/</a>) seems to indicate that we are seeing a large increase in the number of PhDs over the last decade (1800 a year?  thats a bunch to get sucked into Microsoft and Google on a yearly basis).  Several of my cohort had to take postdocs or lectureship jobs (at $3K per class or something else ridiculous) to stay in academia, so it might be a bit of a CS PhD bubble as well.  Falling undergrad enrollments over the last few years might have bottomed out as last year there was an uptick in BS enrollments.<p>The Taulbee data indicates that a large portion of CS PhD types (~60%) wind up in industry positions of one type of another.<p>I would probably encourage talented hackers with the interest to try grad school, but to not feel compelled to go at all if they can pick up challenging work at a startup or even bigger company.<p>Be damn careful about winding up an ""IT professional"" though.

But when I was working for home for a while I got hooked on his show ""the F word"" (BBC America).  Part of that show is about how people no longer cook anymore and he takes it upon himself to get people cooking at home. Tons of simple home cooked ""fast food"" recipes. Really interesting show too. He takes home different livestock (Turkeys, pigs) raises them in his backyard with his kids and slaughters them at the end of the season for a holiday meal.  He's of the opinion if he and his family is going to eat them they're damn well going to know where they come from. It sounds a bit more graphic then it is. Great show.<p>Also a plug for my favorite simple roast chicken is the SF based Zuni Cafe's (you can do it with or without the bread stuffing)<p><a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4401342"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4401342</a>",1262628353

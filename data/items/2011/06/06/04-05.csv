You can't just store hash_b, you'll need to store hash_a too.  It's not worth it.<p>Basically, the assumption that bcrypt is just a function that returns a hash oversimplifies the detail of how salt is stored in practice.",1307336362

That's true, as far as tax optimization goes.<p>However, doing that costs money. You have to pay for the stock. Once you do that, you probably can't just get the money back.<p>Be sure you <i>really</i> trust the company if you do this; in fact, not just the company, but also the board. I have friends who bought shares in companies that wiped out the common stock in acquisitions and did retention grants to keep current employees. Anybody who had left got shafted, even though they had put their own money into the company.<p>(Full disclosure: I decided not to put my own money into shares of the last company I worked for, and that cost me a fair bit of money when they were acquired. I don't really regret the decision, though; I had a choice between investing in the company I was leaving and the company I was starting.)",1307335332

Don't get me wrong, their hardware and datacenters are the best in the world, and as far as I know, nobody is close to matching it. But the software stack on top of it is 10 years old, aging and designed for building search engines and crawlers. And it is well and truly obsolete.<p>Protocol Buffers, BigTable and MapReduce are ancient, creaking dinosaurs compared to MessagePack, JSON, and Hadoop. And new projects like GWT, Closure and MegaStore are sluggish, overengineered Leviathans compared to fast, elegant tools like jQuery and mongoDB. Designed by engineers in a vacuum, rather than by developers who have need of tools.""<p><i>if</i> true, this is a strong indicator that Google is well and truly a BigCo now. Everyone expects a company of Google's size to have its share of politics and crappy middle managers and so on, but this is the first time that I've heard a Google engineer (ok an ex Google engineer) say that its <i>software</i> is bloated and ugly (and more importantly, not getting fixed - see the bits on the rewards structure encouraging territoriality leading to rejection of patches.)<p>Mind blowing.",1307335259

But none... bad advice.<p>With that said, truly must haves are something like these - Cache (W3 Total Cache), backups (e.g. WP-DBManager) and optimization (WP Smush.it).<p>And unless theme provides the functionality, not using XML Sitemap generator and some SEO-plugin is throwing away free traffic.<p>Plus personally, I consider Google Analytics for WordPress a must, as it makes special tracking easy/automatic (e.g. views per category), that would require theme tweaking otherwise - in addition to adding analytics tracking code handily to the blog.<p>p.s. Using cache has very little to do with traffic - and one of the biggest mistakes people make is to start thinking about caching when they already have traffic - what if something goes wrong when you're getting 500 visitors a day?

The savviness of the investors should be a warning sign, not one that instills trust. Remember, in an IPO, they are the ones on the other side of the handshake. They have every incentive to fool you.<p>As for your other points. A ponzi scheme is like Bernie Madoff where you pay off early investors with the money from later investors. I don't believe being open with how the money works would change that. Pyramids are usually where members are pressured to get even more members because a percentage of the new hires' sales goes to the person who brought them in. The bottom of the pyramid cannot get their investment back because they run out of ""greater fools"". It's all a bit confused because if you buy into Groupon you also get ownership of a business which may or may not be worth something.<p>We really can argue about the semantics of these labels but really what it comes down to for me are these two questions: Is this a healthy business, and have the founders acted in the best interest of the business? To me the answers are I don't think so and absolutely not. I don't trust an executive team that would allow 90% of a non-profitable company's runway to go into their own pocket with my money.<p>They've acted in their own self interest to which many would say ""whatever, it was a fair trade"". I want people the people who think that way to realize that sometimes we restrict trades that are ""fair"" regardless of how stupid you are for getting into them. Roulette is a losing game but it is a fair game. We also restrict and regulate it heavily.<p>Anyway, I think we're in agreement on this: it's really interesting to talk about. :-)",1307334841

Therefore, I'm not allowed to start a business here (And God knows I exactly want to do that).\nFrom what I've learned, the best way is to apply for an E-2 visa, which allows you to enter the country in order to develop a business (And only that). One of the condition is the provide proof that you're ready to invest a substantial amount of capital in the company (A friend and lawyer told me it is usually more than 70k). That capital should strictly be for the company, your living expenses or others expenses are not included.\nThe visa is renewable every year and with no limit of to how many time you can renew.<p>For more information go to <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=2ea36811264a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD&vgnextchannel=2ea36811264a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b...</a>",1307333856

There was ample space between the vehicles by the time he changed lanes since the motorcycle was accelerating quickly at that point.<p>Granted it's not recommended, but the likelihood of an experienced rider going down from a short, low wheelie like that is quite low. Saying that it is likely to lead to a pile-up and multiple deaths is hyperbole hardly worth addressing. Pile-ups almost always involve inclement weather.<p>Anyway, it's no more dangerous than the countless drivers I see chatting on their cell phones, disciplining their children in the back, eating lunch, etc. -- activities that probably the majority of drivers engage in at some point.",1307333359

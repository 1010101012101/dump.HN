No-one dares make tough choices now that will depress the share price for 2 or more quarters, they'd get class-actioned into oblivion. A vast corporation that has been public for decades can weather it. A newly public company is in a very difficult position.",1238762336

It so perfectly captured my own views that I went to the campus library and asked for the largest fiction book by Ayn Rand. So I started off reading Atlas Shrugged with nothing more than a single quote on a single topic by her.<p>The first 25 pages were BRUTAL, but after that I was hooked. I finished the book in less than a week then bought the book for myself and read it again. I didn't need to make the leap from Fountain Head at all.",1238761782
544810,comment,544755,544755,0,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>At it’s heart the JVM is designed to run OO languages very efficiently. This is why languages like Ruby and Python are (mostly) easily\nported to the platform...<p>However, the JVM is less suited to running non-OO languages. Languages like Erlang, Haskell, and Scheme provide features, like tail recursion, closures, and continuations, which are not prominent in the mainstream OO world the JVM targets. They depart far enough from the OO model to make the JVM a poor platform choice.</i><p>That's strange, because all of the Smalltalk VMs are capable of closures and many of them can do continuations, yet Smalltalk is often cited as one of the purest OO environments.  (I'm also fairly sure that tail recursion can be done as a compiler trick.)<p>That said, there are real limitations of the JVM.  Most Smalltalk VMs can be targeted by a Java compiler to do a dandy job as a JVM.  It's much harder to target Smalltalk for a JVM, unless you limit the capabilities of the environment.  (Particularly runtime compilation.)",1238761753

544807,comment,543457,544293,0,0,JabavuAdams,,,"I'm kind of working on something similar.<p>One thing that struck me about C++ is that although template parsing, etc, is pretty hard, you can get a long way by segmenting the source into delimited regions. This might also speed up your semantic analysis, by allowing you to write code that's operating on a known kind of region.<p>For instance after pre-processing, it should be easy to find nested ""{"", ""["", ""("", ""\""", ""'"", and ""<"". Segmenting the source in this way, first, might make further processing easier.<p>It seems that the standard parsing methods we learn in CS are optimized for single-pass speed, but not for maintainability or development efficiency. Computers have gotten fast. Using multiple passes of simpler operators seems like a good promising approach.<p>I see the process of parsing as some kind of folding, where you start with a linear sequence of chars and gradually fold it over and over into a ""lumpy"" tree.",1238761531

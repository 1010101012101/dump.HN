The momentum gained by the EmDrive plus the momentum lost by the electromagnetic wave equals zero.

Being more tired during that time than when I was running patrols while deployed.<p>Having a child requires super-human levels of endurance, especially when you are attempting to balance a career, school, and social obligations.<p>You&#x27;re probably going to lose time on your hobby projects for a few years, it&#x27;s easier to accept that than fight it. At the same time, you&#x27;ll learn to work smarter with the time you do have.<p>Having a child, is the best feeling in the world. You wake up everyday full of fear, knowing this little person depends on you for food, shelter, and guidance. You&#x27;ll see them grow up, want to become involved in their hobbies, learn that leaving at 5 and making the nightly family dinner is very important to you.",1437966300

I just looked over the site and the last post and accompanying blog made me feel better about jumping into this next round of treatment. Thanks so much. I&#x27;ll definitely share this.",1437966258

Investigating an alternative monetary system -- at the request of the prime minister -- hardly seems like treason.  Especially if you&#x27;re the finance minister.  Keeping it a secret doesn&#x27;t make it treason either.<p>Treason would be to defect from Greece to the IMF or ECB or Germany with information to sink Greece and eliminate any kind of negotiating power that they might have.",1437966044

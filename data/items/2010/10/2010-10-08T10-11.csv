1771207,story,,,70,27,pcidss-clueless,"Ask HN: Help me understand online payment gateways",,"I'm a long time developer that's recently moved into web development. I'm also based in the UK, so that seems to limit my options somewhat significantly.<p>As I understand it, my options are either speak to my bank about a internet merchant account, or use a third-party payment processor. It seems however, that if my company is newly formed and thus doesn't really have a trading history, the likelyhood of my bank allowing me to have an internet merchant account is slim. Using a third-party payment processor usually - from what I can see - results in customers being redirected to a third-party branded checkout page, which I want to avoid. Is this correct, or am I missing something?<p>If I have a merchant account and people are submitting payment data to my server that I am then passing on to be processed, I am responsible for PCI DSS compliance, correct? (Am I correct in my understanding that Braintree gets around this by having your checkout form POST to their servers?)<p>Lastly, can anyone recommend a means for me to accept credit and debit card payments [in pounds Sterling, for a UK site] for a newly formed business that doesn't use a third-party [Paypal, Google Checkout etc]?",1286535465

1771204,comment,1770950,1770950,0,0,Kliment,,,"There was this idea floating around on some virtual reality forums some years back about an ""adblock for real life"" that would work in a very similar way with a head-mounted display. In terms of pattern recognition it is not at all difficult. Detection and tracking of a set of images is pretty much a solved problem in computer vision (doing it reliably in realtime is still somewhat of a black art). I like how this is framed as an art project, and it's a very cool proof of concept, though it's an issue that it doesn't black out logos until after they have been seen, and the blackout box blinking on and off as the detector passes its threshold only draws attention to those areas. A practical implementation could use inpainting algorithms (also built into OpenCV, and even provided in one of the samples) to fill the logoed areas with background-like texture, so that it's not an obvious ""censored"" black patch but a smooth transition.",1286535381

I am very frustrated and scared due to what I have read and observed in general about IT/CS jobs. I just need you guys to give me some guidance about what i should pursue.
The job scene in India is normal. Most jobs are with the Big outsourcing Consultancies like Wipro, Infosys et al. After talking to family and friends in the industry, these jobs seem like a scam, pretty much same tasks day in and out. I dont want to be a billable warm body.<p>I on the other hand, have studied computers and the science behind it since i was 12.I am good at development, and yes i have also read TAOCP thrice and i am well versed with algorithms and low level hardware and architecture, In short, i am not a code monkey. So now i am in a dilemma as to what i should go deep into? I love infrastructure stuff like Networking/Sysadmin/Build and release stuff. And since most programming jobs in India are mostly boring java/.net jobs, i want to avoid them.<p>Can you guys guide me as to what specialization i should go after. And since it is India, I will need certifications to prove my worth. I was thinking of Doing Red hat certifications and cisco and juniper certifications(just to get my foot in the door). If you guys have any suggestions, I would really be helpful if you guys could help me out.<p>My current skills:
Programming: Python(love it) , Java (safe backup for job), C/c++ (mostly QT), mostly all types of shell scripting.
Frameworks: app engine (both python and java), django, sql alchemy. and all other java frameworks starting with 'J' :)<p>What i am intrested in:
Networking Hardware/ Planning/ Design.
System Planning/ Design / Maintainence. (any platform)
mostly data center jobs.",1286534762

It is my understanding that the customers for integrated circuits during the 70s and earlier were primarily the military and large corporations.  While delvoping technology for those sort of companies may be more ""real"", it hardly seems like that sort of work would be any less profit-driven.<p>Also I would guess that the prominence of silly start-ups that are based on ""game mechanics, addiction, self-reference, and narcissism"" is made to appear larger because these sorts of companies need large numbers of people to be aware of them.  Start-ups that create products that are not used by the general public probably will not seek publicity and thus you are less likely to read about them on tech crunch.<p>I have interned at three start-ups over the last 4 years and none of them have ever been mentioned on Techcrunch, despite one of them being involved in some serious M&A action.  But why would they be, since readers probably are not hugely interesting in moving silicon wafers around a fab and companies are unlikely to find customers for their protein analysis hardware.<p>So before you lament that lack of ""real"" start-ups, consider the possibility that you just are not hearing about them.",1286534555
1771178,comment,1770425,1770425,0,0,Mz,,,"My politically incorrect opinion is that what it takes for a woman to stay thin usually means living in a way that doesn't go along with having babies and devoting yourself to them at the expense of having a life of your own.  Men can't get pregnant and generally don't devote themselves to their spouse/children at the expense of a career the way women frequently do.  A ""good husband and father"" is generally one who makes good money, not one who quits work to care for the kids.  A lot of married women have trouble finding the time to go to the gym and such.  A woman who can manage to do so is probably not being treated like a domestic slave.  In most cases, it is the ""being treated like a domestic slave"" thing that is what really hurts the ability of women to earn good money.  Men generally aren't subjected to that.  If they are neglecting their health to be slavishly devoted to something, it is usually slavish devotion to their career -- which typically does lead to more money.",1286534322

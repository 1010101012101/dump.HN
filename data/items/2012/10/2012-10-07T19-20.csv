Android has captured a bigger chunk of the market, but Apple is reaping most of the profits (since their devices are high margin) and is therefore in a much better position to innovate or leap on opportunities that come up. I mean, who wouldn't want to sit on a $120+ billion warchest?<p>What's going to be really interesting is when (if) the ""iPad Mini"" comes out. There was an article on Ars Technica last month where a reputable analyst claimed Apple found a way to manufacture iPad Minis with the last generation iPad's components. What that means is that even at $250, the device would be extremely high margin. Not only would it allow Apple to lock down the lower market segment, but also result in a huge increase in profits. From a business standpoint it seems like a no-brainer, because a cheap and yet high margin device is not something that other manufacturers can imitate.",1349639906

They might stop a few hundred potential spammers but they also stop millions of people who could potentially be using email more effiently and reliably (and Spam Free) by sending and/or receiving mail directly between their machines.<p>Email could be even more decentralized than it already is in practice.  This could potentially make spam far more difficult.<p>Reading that quote (from SpamHaus?) two things come to mind:<p>1. We are entrusting the rules on our mail delivery to someone who begins sentences with ""Very many"" and lacks the attention to detail to spell ""reasonable"" correctly.  Make of that what you will.<p>2. The ""problem"" is not the existence of ""bad email servers"" on dynamic IP's, it is the lack of ""good email servers"" on dynamic IP's.  Why the heck aren't the millions of people on dynamic IP's using this capability?  Answer: They do not know it exists.<p>To ""replace email"", we do not necessarily need to fundamentally change anything about how email works.  What we need to do, perhaps, is replace the people controlling it and instruct ""good"" people how it works.  As it stands, in general, the only folks who understand how email works are a. email providers (e.g. ISP's), b. spammers and c. spam fighters.<p>If the vast majority of email sent directly to recipients from dynamic IP's was low volume and noncommercial, the ""bad apples"" would be overshadowed by the good ones.  And so would the anti-spam zealots be overshadowed by reasonable people who just want to communicate with each other (not necessarily trying to sell ED treatments to the whole of humanity).<p>Education is the way forward.  People arguing against any sort of consumer education on something so basic as internet messaging are an interesting spectacle to behold.  Their attitude should fuel the fire of anyone working on this ""dangerous idea"" of ""replacing email"".  You know who you are.",1349639842

4624236,comment,4623512,4623848,1,0,greenyoda,,,"Microsoft may have had a dominant share in the PC operating systems market, but I don't think they were ever a monopoly. Anyone who wanted an alternative to Windows was always free to buy a Mac. It's not Microsoft's fault that more people didn't do this; it was because Macs were much more expensive than commodity PCs and most buyers didn't think that the extra cost was worth it. If Apple had ever made their operating system run on commodity PCs, they could have taken a large chunk of the OS market from Microsoft. But that wasn't Apple's strategy.<p>As far as bundling Internet Explorer is concerned, one can argue that Microsoft foresaw that a browser was going to become a required piece of software that everyone would want to have on their PC (just like a text editor; nobody every complained that Microsoft was giving away Notepad and Wordpad with Windows). And without a pre-installed browser, you'd have to go to an FTP server just to get a copy of a different browser, something that the average user would be unable to do. Similarly, Apple bundles Safari with every Mac, iPad and iPhone for the same reason: you couldn't sell one of these devices today if they didn't have a browser on them as soon as they came out of the box.<p>Microsoft did engage in real anti-competitive tactics, such as coercing hardware manufacturers to pre-install Windows on all their machines whether users wanted it or not. However, there are laws against ""restraint of trade"" [1] that apply whether a company is a monopoly or not.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law#United_States_antitrust"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law#United_States_...</a>",1349639711

4624198,comment,4623996,4623996,12,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I can confirm the same kind of experience with Microsoft stores with the one just outside Chicago. When I first saw it I wondered why they would even open such a store when Microsoftt products don't really lend themselves to a branded store. I speculated that they just saw how well the Apple store did and decided to copy just like they copy a lot of things competitors do (for better or worse, I'm not saying its bad/good, right/wrong). Then another more plausible thought came to mind. This could be a way to get people to believe there's no difference between Apple and Microsoft. In fact I have this creeping feeling they actually want to confuse people into thinking its the same store. In my case there was an Apple store on the opposite end of the same mall. Think about it. Both stores are eerily similar on first glance. They both have just a big logo outside with an open floor plan and a bunch of products on tables. My own mother who loves Apple products, owns a few, but is still not a tech savvy person asked me ""Is that the new Apple store?"". It reminded me of the way Samsung designed and packaged some of their phones and tablets in such a way that ""moms who always buy the wrong thing for Christmas"" are tricked into thinking a tablet is an iPad because it looks like an iPad. In this case it almost seems like the idea is to get people to buy a laptop/phome/whatever from the Microsoft store because it looks like the Apple store and therefor if it looks the same it must be the same.<p>But the problem with a dedicated Microsoft store is that You can buy a Microsoft product anywhere. There's no difference in terms of products between a Microsoft store and a Best Buy, Wal Mart, Target, any cell phome carrier's store, and electronics shops in general. The products in a MS store is just a subset of what you can get anywhere else. Now contrast this with the experience of buying an Apple product. There's a consistent experience and consistent branding across the board. There's the Apple store which is the ultimate controlled experience and even when you buy an Apple product elsewhere there's still consistency. For example, if you buy an Apple product from Best Buy there's a dedicated Apple area that is specially set up and designed like a mini Apple store even if it's a single table with an iMac and a MacBook. The table is the same table as the one at the Apple store and so are the tags (iPads with prices and specs) and there's even a little wall that looks like a chunk of Apple Store.<p>There's always consistent branding with Apple too. Even if you buy an iMac out the back of some guys truck! That's because all their products have a distinct look and the little apple logo. You can't buy an HP Mac or a Lenovo MacBook Air. If it's an Apple then it's an Apple from top to bottom and there's no other logos or branding anywhere.<p>This is why a Microsoft Store not only doesn't make sense but makes it look like an attempt to copy, confuse, mislead, or create a false equivalency between the Microsoft and Apple brands. Now that Microsoft looks like its going to start manufacturing it's own hardware like with the new Surface it would make sense but until they can fill a store with Microsoft manufactured products first and foremost with a few sections for third party accessories then it looks more like a cheap way to ride someone else's coat tails.",1349639060

4624132,comment,4623486,4623697,12,0,sedachv,,,"You're confusing design with visual appeal. Steve Jobs loved to rant about design and longetivity, but Apple laptops only seem to excel on visual appeal (and this is a recent phenomenon - just look at the first PowerBook G4s). Design has to be functional, and this is where Apple always makes sacrifices.<p>Bringing chiclet-style keyboards back into vogue (to the point where even Lenovo now puts them on Thinkpads) shows a complete disregard for the functionality of the laptop as a computer. Try comparing the new apple-style chiclet keys, to ""skateboard-ramp"" shaped keys (an ""innovation"" introduced by IBM to save costs), to the spherical shaped keys (<a href=""http://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/?page_id=1458#shapes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/?page_id=1458#shapes</a>) of high-end keyboards from the 1980s and you will see how far computer keyboards have actually degenerated. This isn't just my opinion - Kathleen Potosnak's review of literature (appears as chapter 21 in Helander's Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction) shows that shaped keys are better for typing.<p>There's a lot to be said about 3-button mice as well. One thing I do like about Macs is the touchpad on the newest ones (it took Apple a long time to make them really useful, though). Again, this is a sacrifice in terms of functionality. You can do things like <a href=""https://github.com/vsedach/mouse-copy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vsedach/mouse-copy</a> with the Thinkpad touchpoint and even the trackpad, but it's not convenient with most other trackpads (especially ones like the Mac's that don't have separate keys).<p>In terms of longetivity and visual design, I'm typing this on a 2004 Thinkpad T43. Nothing on this machine is broken, and despite 8 years of almost continuous use, even the keyboard labels only have a few nicks. This laptop looks as new or as old as the early 90s 386 Thinkpad we have at the hackerspace or the X230 my friend bought a few months ago. It wasn't until the PowerBook that Apple hit on a design with any sort of longetivity. Besides Apple and IBM/Lenovo, there's no one making laptops with a lasting design across many product generations.",1349637967

4624100,comment,4623231,4623914,7,0,sentenza,,,"I think I have to disagree here. From my experience, working as a team is the centerpoint of German work culture. This includes giving each member of a team the oportunity to contribute in discussions and then also taking their suggestions seriously. The hierarchy is there, but rather at the same level or below the level of most other European countries.<p>In France, on the other hand, hierarchy is very strict, including within a team. Supposedly, this is caused by the French higher education system.<p>Taken together, the German and the French model often produce horrible failures when a French company tries to expand into Germany. If there is a problem to be solved within a team, the German Engineers/Workers will expect to hear the following at a meeting: ""Listen guys, we have to change this and that, how do you think we could do it?"". A French manager, however, is trained to walk into the meeting and say ""We are now doing it like this."".<p>Generally, I would recommend to stop associating strict hierarchy with Germany. Things have been changing for at least 40 Years now and in many fields (probably not all however) the amount of hierarchy is ""normal"". Things like pulling rank are observed rather seldomly in the technical fields. If you want to see how these things used to be a long time ago, you might want to look at Austria.<p>Also, if you want a reason for why there is no SV-like feel to any of the German technology ""hubs"", I'd suggest risk-aversion as a reason. If you asked me what the most central collective character trait of todays Germans is, my answer would be risk-aversion. When you tell a German what he can gain, he will ask you what he could lose.<p>On a side note, be careful when forming an opinion about Europe if your only fluent European language is English. Things might look very different on the other side of the language barrier. When talking about Germany, for instance, even the most carefully written publication from the UK will have inaccuracies in it. The way in which todays Germany and the Germanys past are convoluted in public discourse in the UK will influence anybody living there, even if he actively tries to avoid it. On the other side of the coin, natives or expats that live in a European country and tell you about it also have narratives, usually heavyly influenced by how they want to see themselves and their nationality.

Full mouse control without moving my hands significantly away from where they were on the keyboard anyways. My X220 has a trackpad, but I only use it by accident.<p>- An LED that lives above the monitor and has a shield that points it down to light up the keyboard.

I've got two USB drives, a pair of headphones, a few USB-powered accessories, two monitors, a mouse, and a keyboard plugged into my computer when it's at the office. My MBP-toting coworkers have to connect and disconnect all that when they pick up their computer; I press the big <i>undock</i> button and it all stays where I left it, and reconnects when I put it back on the desk.<p>- Accessory comparability.

They accepted the offer.  Great, the market has spoken; that's what the content is deemed to be worth.  Its worthless.  Its worthless because it is possible to obtain it without paying for it.<p>In any industry whatsoever if you offer a price of $0 then people will take it.  Try offering beer for $0  maybe you can support it with advertising ;)<p>The price point that Spotify is offering is in competion with piracy. That's why it is so low.<p>> If you don't like it, take your songs off spotify.<p>Why would I do that ? I love Spotify. There is no income in it for me as a rights holder, but there's no benefit for me to remove it.  [I am far more likely to remove my music from iTunes actually.  its just not a good look, there are better digital stores]<p>I think they have great intentions and want desperately to make this new economy work.  They cannot just raise the price (they would love to) because they could kill the whole thing and sales would drop off.  They are losing money in order to keep this thing going.<p>What I said was that its use for the user is to replace sales; but the payment and pricing (in and out) are like that of broadcast.<p>Its a very unfortunate disruption.<p>> Spotify isn't cheating you out of anything.<p>sigh. people are so binary when discussing this stuff.  Its more complicated.  It would be nice if people weren't so hostile and always trying to identify a bad guy to blame everything on.",1349636781

The accuracy is often equal or slightly worse than in-memory techniques.<p>Vowpal Wabbit is made to scale. You set a fixed bitsize and words and n-grams are hashed. So if you expect 2^32 unique words you set the bitsize to around 32. More data is usually better. Linear speed-ups by adding parallel machines.<p>I too think that HN&#x27;s user patterns could be different than other web estates. With large scale spam filters like at Yahoo mail, I believe they employ two (or more) models: One fitted on your inbox, and one fitted on everyone&#x27;s inbox. That ensemble model should be able to specialize on your behavior, yet still be able to detect general spam that it has already seen in other boxes.<p>>Is this the basic assumption that close documents also have close information entropy?<p>Yes, that is the gist of it. The better the compressor, the closer NCD will approximate NID.<p>A simple principle: Compressors do a better job on repeating data patterns. If two files or documents share data patterns, then adding these together and compressing, will result in a smaller filesize, than if you concatenate and compress two files that don&#x27;t share any data patterns.<p>NCD works on text, but not as good as other algo&#x27;s for NLP. Sometimes PAQ (very slow, but efficient compressor) is used on genome data, or bzip on binary files like virusses. I don&#x27;t think it will be practical here, since for a comparison every other file would need to be concatenated and compressed. If not using a fast compressor like Snappy or Gzip this would take a while, over a simple cosine distance between tokens.",1406348839

(e.g.: he looks identical to one of the terrorists)  The problem as stated suggests that there&#x27;s an equal chance of being a false positive every time.  In that case, the simple solution would be to place cameras at regular intervals - when an alarm goes off, wait a minute or two.

Unless there&#x27;s a reputable non-profit organization that can validate the results of those classes and make them worth recognizing, they create a bit of education for the consumer but are worth little in the working world.<p>Udacity is much better than most MOOCs at this, given that most of them have a limited window for which you can submit projects for completion.  My anecdote: I wanted to take classes from Coursera on data science, but I am the sole developer for a publisher and have worked 60-70 hour weeks during the time that they&#x27;ve published the classes due to a project crunch.  I don&#x27;t currently have time to keep up with the course material in order to complete the class satisfactorily.<p>Now, you can rebut that somewhat by saying that we have free public resources in libraries to take advantage of, but when you&#x27;re raising a kid and working a shift at the grocery store, you don&#x27;t have much time to be in the library, most of which have very short hours on Saturdays and are closed on Sundays.<p>What we need are cheaper computers and subsidized internet access.",1406348311

I recently had to migrate our company into this model to get our BAA signed.<p>I like what you&#x27;ve built, but I think you might be missing the real pain point. I agree that it&#x27;s a hassle to setup a compliant infrastructure on Amazon. But, this is a one-time process. Most serious healthcare IT companies (and startups) will undertake this responsibility themselves to have tight control over their infrastructure.<p>The real challenge is maintaing the system and providing access control as the system grows. We handle upwards of 50K clinical notes a day. When we encounter an issue we have to be able to track which note caused the problem and get access to it all within the confines of our system.<p>Our access policy requires:<p>1. Connection to the dedicated VPC\n2. SSH access to specific instances<p>Here&#x27;s what I regard as the real problem ---> Once you&#x27;re SSH&#x27;d onto the instance, you can do basically anything.

This is not necessarily a conclusive argument against undertaking them (if survival is at stake) but a balanced view of the kind we don&#x27;t get is needed.<p>The language used is that of religious fervour with talk of &#x27;denial&#x27;, and &#x27;sceptics&#x27; - as if reasoned scepticism isn&#x27;t the basis of how science progresses. (&quot;Conjecture and refutation- Karl Popper&quot; anyone?)<p>My point is not to argue against CAGW but to bemoan the lack of any calm appraisal of pros and cons. A response to risk mitigation is here:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw5Lda06iK0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw5Lda06iK0</a> where the thesis is based on figures accepted by the IPCC and Lord Stern. I&#x27;ve not seen a sensible rebuttal. No one discusses the massive increase in the utterly predictable &#x27;greening of the planet&#x27; that has and is taking place as a result of the CO2 increase. This translates to $billions in crop production.  We only hear of negative effects. Estimates of the lowering of temperature supposedly linked to lowering of emissions after 50-100 years, cite decreases imperceptible to a human and hedged with uncertainties as to their origin and statistical treatment. And so on.<p>Finally, you don’t have to be a climate scientist to note that 1/3 of all emissions of CO2 have occurred since 1970 with no significant increase in global temperature. What do we deduce from this about CAGW? This is a question not a slanted conclusion.",1449907190

Instead I said it was my &quot;least favorite&quot;, because of it&#x27;s so rarely applied correctly.  By the rest of your comment, I get the impression you didn&#x27;t catch my meaning.<p><pre><code>    > For example if US Army has a tendency to employ \n    > rapists, it&#x27;s valid to criticise US Army for this fact \n    > even if they have a rule that forbids such behavior.\n</code></pre>\nHere, the critical point is not that the US Army employed <i>a rapist</i> or even <i>several rapists</i>.  Instead you&#x27;re saying they have a <i>tendency to employ racists</i>.  No True Scotsman would only apply if someone from the Army made a statement in complete denial of that fact, hand waving it away by pointing out the rule and saying something to the effect of &quot;The Army has a rule against rape, so anyone who does that isn&#x27;t a real soldier&quot;.  It&#x27;s a valid No True Scotsman because the behavior is clearly evident in a non-fringe component of the group.<p>If someone did make that statement in sincerity, sure, send in the No True Scotsman patrol and take &#x27;em out.  But that&#x27;s not how it usually happens.  Typically, there&#x27;s a singular incident.  That&#x27;s often followed by a careless article which paints with an overly broad brush: &quot;Does the Army have a rape problem?&quot;.<p>And <i>that</i> is the point where I start looking for the misapplied No True Scotsmans to crop up.  There&#x27;s no way for anyone to defend the Army by pointing out that it&#x27;s against the rules, or that the number of rape incidents in the army is lower than the general population, or really any other facts.<p><pre><code>    > It&#x27;s important to call out this fallacy, because the \n    > membership in a group can&#x27;t be defined on the basis of a \n    > person&#x27;s conduct, since there&#x27;s no way to monitor that \n    > every member of the group adheres to this conduct.\n</code></pre>\nI believe this idea right here is the source of all these misapplications.  And it&#x27;s just false.  <i>Of course</i> membership in a group can be defined by a person&#x27;s conduct.  Try comparing Hacker News to Reddit in 3 or 4 comments and see how quickly you get shadowbanned.  In fact, I&#x27;d say defining group membership based on conduct is the rule, not the exception.<p>No True Scotsman is intended to point out the fallacy of someone inside a group avoiding criticism by constantly shrinking or changing the group rules in order to draw a distinction from some negative person or incident.  If the goalposts aren&#x27;t moving, then its likely the person really <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a True Scotsman, and you should maybe try to understand why not.",1449906965

Sometimes the answer might be &quot;No, we&#x27;re not going back to the Web 1.0 UX.&quot; But ignoring the top bugs for multiple years suggests a breakdown in the feedback mechanism. If Yahoo doesn&#x27;t care, that&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s just business.

That&#x27;s exactly why I&#x27;m not worried about AI as an existential threat to humanity.<p>A few years back Bill Joy was sounding the alarm on nanotechnology. He sounded a lot like Elon Musk does today. Nanobots could be a run-away technology that would reduce the world to &quot;grey goo&quot;. But nothing like that will ever happen. The world is already awash in nanobots. We call them bacteria. Given the right conditions, they grow at an exponential rate. But they don&#x27;t consume the entire earth in a couple of days, because &quot;the right conditions&quot; can&#x27;t be sustained. They run out of energy. They drown in their own waste.<p>AI will be the same. Yes, machines are better than us at some things, and that list is growing all the time. But biology is ferociously good at converting sunlight into pockets of low entropy. AI such as it exists today is terrible at dealing with the physical world, and only through a tremendous amount of effort are we able to keep it running.

The idea being that if AI safety is something that you can just tack on to a working design at the end, they don&#x27;t have a comparative advantage there: it&#x27;s difficult to predict which design will win and the design&#x27;s implementor is best positioned to tack on the safety bit themselves.<p>>...imagine a hypothetical computer security expert named Bruce. You tell Bruce that he and his team have just 3 years to modify the latest version of Microsoft Windows so that it can’t be hacked in any way, even by the smartest hackers on Earth. If he fails, Earth will be destroyed because reasons.<p>>Bruce just stares at you and says, “Well, that’s impossible, so I guess we’re all fucked.”<p>>The problem, Bruce explains, is that Microsoft Windows was never designed to be anything remotely like “unhackable.” It was designed to be easily useable, and compatible with lots of software, and flexible, and affordable, and just barely secure enough to be marketable, and you can’t just slap on a special Unhackability Module at the last minute.<p>>To get a system that even has a chance at being robustly unhackable, Bruce explains, you’ve got to design an entirely different hardware + software system that was designed from the ground up to be unhackable. And that system must be designed in an entirely different way than Microsoft Windows is, and no team in the world could do everything that is required for that in a mere 3 years. So, we’re fucked.<p>>But! By a stroke of luck, Bruce learns that some teams outside Microsoft have been working on a theoretically unhackable hardware + software system for the past several decades (high reliability is hard) — people like Greg Morrisett (SAFE) and Gerwin Klein (seL4). Bruce says he might be able to take their work and add the features you need, while preserving the strong security guarantees of the original highly secure system. Bruce sets Microsoft Windows aside and gets to work on trying to make this other system satisfy the mysterious reasons while remaining unhackable. He and his team succeed just in time to save the day.<p>>This is an oversimplified and comically romantic way to illustrate what MIRI is trying to do in the area of long-term AI safety...<p><a href=""http://lukemuehlhauser.com/a-reply-to-wait-but-why-on-machine-superintelligence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lukemuehlhauser.com/a-reply-to-wait-but-why-on-machin...</a>",1449904942

And perhaps we can simply rope the major ISPs into it as a liability dodge.

10722071,comment,10721371,10721912,0,0,Rapzid,,,"I hate to nit, but do the applications really not need special code? Most applications require secrets in one of their own config files, or through some other mechanism that is not <i>some</i> file in <i>some</i> format. If you need to write the code to get this secret off the file system and to where the app can use it.. What&#x27;s the difference between using a simple client to fetch from vault vs fetch from the file system?<p>I don&#x27;t currently use either vault or keywhiz(we rolled our own solution using KMS and dynamodb) so I&#x27;m not really knocking either method. The current state-of-the-art with configuration management and secret distribution(particularly for container stuff) still requires a lot of customization code specific to each wrapped application, unless you wrote it all yourself to suite.<p>At the risk of sounding like a fanboy though, I will say that my own solution and others that have come out feel very itch-scratchy compared to vault. From what I have read about vault it has a much more thought out and productized vibe. Lots of cool features beyond delivering an encrypted blob from point A to B. I get this impression from a lot of Hashicorp components in general, and feel it&#x27;s a shame larger open source projects like Kubernetes aren&#x27;t integrating them while letting scaling to 200 hosts be a blocker to their next release...

I had few friends who were significantly different from me in terms of money/education/class/race/etc. Kinda like most people. A few years traveling full-time, getting to know homeless folks and undocumented folks, and seeing how class and race plays out in our &quot;free market&quot; system changed my mind on a few things.<p>And, I think dismissing libertarianism out of hand, as though it has no interesting/valuable ideas, is somewhat silly. The LP was literally decades ahead of the curve on LGBTQ rights, ending the war on drugs, and opposition to war (of all sorts). All at a time when those ideas were extremely unpopular in mainstream politics. I disagree with the premises behind their economic policy ideas, but it doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t understand the allure of the non-aggression principle (I just think they&#x27;re mistaken about capitalism being free of aggression).<p>So, how about you? What took you so long to come to your views? Why weren&#x27;t you born with the correct ideas on every issue? Or were you? You reckon you&#x27;re right on everything now?

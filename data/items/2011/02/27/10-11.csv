They self-regulate the size of labor supply in their fields, inflating their salaries. Why do you think we have a doctor shortage? You really think there aren't enough smart people to do the job? No, the AMA controls the number of med school graduates each year by limiting the number of accredited medical schools. They also lobby governments to legislate that nurses can't perform medical procedures (all towards the not-so-discrete goal of preserving their six-figure salaries).<p>Teachers? They can't be fired thanks to tenure policies. This was the biggest issue with public schooling when I grew up, and [continues to be](<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/nyregion/16rubber.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/nyregion/16rubber.html?_r=...</a>). Survive three years and you have job security for life. If my workplace hired and fired based on seniority, we would have gone bankrupt years ago.<p>Firefighters and policemen also can do no wrong--aside from amazing pensions they have great job security and the power to help those they know more than others in the event of disaster (e.g. Katrina).<p>For every example of those in the ""heroic professions"" doing the right thing, you have the same careerism and self-preservation that those in private industry strive for. But in many people's eyes, they can do no wrong.",1298804297

Hope you find all answers below:<p>What did you use to build it?\ncronsync is built on CakePHP.<p>How are you marketing it?\nActually we developed cronsync for the use in our own agency while working for our clients. We are a small agency with 4 developers and do not have a marketing department. The main marketing tools are blogs and word of mouth.<p>What are you doing to try to get users?\nWe are constantly contacting blog writers and doing some PR related activities. We are screening the web for our competitors and our topics and try to make something out of this information.<p>How has your usage been growing?\nWe are just starting to promote cronsync and currently count approx. two new registrations per day.<p>What problems did you have?\nThe most challenging thing was actually finding the time to develop cronsync in addition to our normal work for our clients as a web agency.<p>Are you doing A/B testing on your landing page? What's your conversion rate?\nNo, we currently are using just one landing page. There are not enough users that an A/B testing would bring representative results.<p>When do you expect to start charging?\nWe plan to start charging once we have 10,000 registered users. ;-) This year will be the testing phase and we want to take the feedback from our users as well as the time to improve cronsync further. As we earn money with our current agency clients, we are not reliant on earning money with cronsync from scratch.<p>How will you decide your price points?\nWe want to be better and cheaper than our competitors.<p>Will you have multiple account types?\nThere will be a very simply system. One monthly fee per user. Depending on the future developments we might also offer other account types.<p>What have you left out? And why?\nWe have not developed any apps or widgets so far as we thought our time was better spent on the cronsync core features.<p>Can you make available your analysis of the market? Why do you think you've hit the sweet spot?\nWe are not the first to create a time tracking and invoicing app.  But cronsync is very user friendly and supports essential features in combination we could not find elsewhere: \nDifferent hourly rates for different job roles/clients and different hourly rates for internal and external use\nDashboard with transparent view on the real profitability of projects and clients\nGenerates professional and nicely formatted invoices from the time tracking data,  adjustable detail level of invoices\nEasy integration of internal and external staff such as freelancers or affiliates<p>Can I get my data back out again? In what formats? Is it encrypted when it's stored?\nThere is a csv and xml export available. The connection is save and there is an encryption for passwords but the other data is not additionally encrypted.<p>Best, Jakob",1298801241

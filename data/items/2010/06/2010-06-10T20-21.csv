It was easy to come up with a new, revolutionary OS in 80s/90s - you could write one yourself. Right now, anyone writing an OS for the OS itself (not for research) has failed before they start (unless they've got a large experienced team and loads of money to burn). You have hardware you cannot easily access, loads of applications you cannot make a compatibility layer for, etc. etc.<p>When you created a lisp machine, it was a lisp machine - everyone knew why and how you did it (to some extent). If you wanted to run it, you ported ""the program"" to it and all was good. Right now you have users expecting at least the stuff they can get from other popular systems - and that's years of work away for any new project.<p>The best you can probably do, as far as ""progress"" goes is to create a new research system and port the good stuff back to mainstream (singularity, plan9, etc.)<p>To some extent we know all there is to know right now... New languages, periferials, usage ideas are still created. But for a new system language you need to either create or port a system and gather some followers. That's a big step.<p>Edit: Actually I believe that there's a new hardware change coming that will make current computers ineffective in some way. We could switch to new hardware, new languages, new systems... we could start from scratch :) I don't believe the current ways of parallelising computation can do that.. but if someone constructs a concurrent bus/memory/cpu that could invalidate some of the normal programming ideas.",1276203572

He seems to suggest that sticking C keeps the focus on attracting people who like to build things. There are surely very productive programmers who use c++ and other newer languages but sometimes embracing new developments means opening the door to people who are just following fads. Just as an example - the kernel has managed to avoid the following developments - uml, xml etc. Not saying that uml and xml dont have their legitimate uses, but sometimes keeping things bare and simple has the effect of keeping posers out. As a sidenote, I dont seem to recollect any recent groundbreaking progress in languages for systems level programming (singularity from microsoft might be an exception). At some point people were trying things like oberon, lisp machines, but I dont seem to recall any new developments which explore dynamically different ways of building computer systems.

The use of the second person singular in, say, French (tu) or German (du) is restricted to the familiar (at least in polite society), and cannot be used across class or organisational hierarchical levels despite any actual familiarity. (English retains a similar structure in the use of ""woman"" versus ""lady"" -- females of both higher and lower status have, until very recently, been referred to using ""lady"".) In other words, dropping ""thou"" in the few special cases that allowed its use was a natural process of language change.

Your limit is supposed to be invisible to the market, only you and your dealer know it.  But the HFT algorithms have a way to probe your order and uncover your limit.<p>The stock is currently trading around $15, so your order hits the exchange, and in the first few milliseconds, a HFT computer makes a micro-offer for 10 shares at $16, then 10 shares at $17, then 10 shares $20, then 10 shares at $21.<p>When the last offer is rejected b/c it's over your limit, the computer then guesses your limit is $20 and offers to sell you 2960 shares at your limit of $20.<p>All this happens in just a few milliseconds, and it just cost you roughly (2960x20 + $20 + $17 + $16 + $15) - (3000 x $15) = 59,268 - 45,000 = $14,268.

In normal times, dozens of computer algorithms are posting bids to buy and offers to sell stock, at slightly more profitable prices than what their algorithm determines is the fair value.<p>On the day in question, the algorithms' ""oh crap"" mode kicked in, the bots no longer felt they had a grasp on fair value, and decided to withdraw all their bids and offers.  Now whoever was left trying to sell (like all the people with STOP orders) had to do so in an environment with very few counterparties.<p>The stock exchanges give these market maker bots a few special privileges in return for them providing liquidity regularly.  It varies by exchange, but one example is a market maker must quote a spread of no greater than 10 cents, and provide both a bid and offer at least 99% of the time.  In return, the market maker gets a special spot in line when orders come through (think of it as first dibbs on certain proposed orders).<p>So it sounds like we should either blame the guys who put in market stop orders, or we should blame the exchanges for not requiring more strict rules for their market makers (like 100% uptime).  You can't blame the algorithms for wisely using the 1% of the time they are allowed to hide and wait for more opportune times.",1276201313

Turkey has historically had a serious problem collecting taxes and has been trying to clamp down recently.  This is based on my own anecdotal evidence as a first-generation Turk living in the US - I wish I could provide statistics, but a quick search did not bring anything up for me.<p>There is a large 'informal' economy consisting of shopkeepers, street vendors and other small businesses that are not registered and avoid paying taxes completely.  In the last few years, Turkey has been trying to cut down on this by requiring all businesses (including street vendors) to produce a receipt that shows they charged tax.  They regularly send 'undercover' government officials to make purchases from these vendors to test if the business offers a receipt and give heavy fines if they do not.<p>One time, after I tried to purchase a bottle of water and declined a receipt, the shopkeeper grabbed my arm, shoved the receipt into my palm, and demanded I take it.  After that, I got into a conversation with him about taxes (he said less than 10% of citizens pay, although that seems low) and, when I described the IRS and how it was a crime in the US not to pay taxes, he was shocked and wished Turkey had a similar system.

From the outside I always assumed the constant flood of new, half-baked features instead of fixes and improvements to old ones was caused by interns and junior devs looking for glory ...""<p>Am I understanding you correct; are you implying that you think XNA was created by juniors? Would you say that because of this, it's a good thing XNA is being killed?<p>Cause personally I think it's been a terrible decision by Microsoft to kill XNA. A lot of indie game developers have relied on XNA and I really feel Microsoft can use the indie support. Sure, big name games might be a priority, but personally I feel most _interesting_ work is being done by indies. Indies tend to be less concerned with proven formulas and seem to see it more of a creative outlet for themselves[1]. I think it's a good thing frameworks like Monogame[2] exist, so developers can still put their existing XNA knowledge to good use - and not just limited to the Windows platform, but e.g. iOS and Android as well.<p>The Monogame website might not show very impressing examples, but a game like Bastion[3] was ported to other platforms using Monogame, showing very high-quality work can be created with XNA.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhaT78i1x2M"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhaT78i1x2M</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://monogame.codeplex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monogame.codeplex.com</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/2012/08/bastions-open-source-branch-for-monogame/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/2012/08/bastions-open-s...</a>",1368305729

The buying drove the price even further up and caused an even bigger ""squeeze"" on those with short positions.  This pattern leads to the astronomical rise you saw.

The only ambiguity typically comes from traversing different branches of the discipline, which is inevitable considering how many branches there are and how deep they go.<p>Furthermore, mathematics is all about communication. The language of mathematics exists to codify concepts so that they can be talked about concisely. Being able to say 'group' instead of 'set with an associative binary operation with identities' is essential if you want to be able to build on top of that concept without taking an hour to read one theorem.<p>The handicap in communication isn't on the mathematics end, it's on your end. You seem to expect them to be able to explain structures to you that took years of work to build by using the same language that you use to talk about sports or social events. The reality is that you are not the target audience of their communication, and they are okay with that. You should be too.<p>The weirdest assertion that you made is that high-level programming languages ought to be as close as possible to human languages. The two categories of languages exist to communicate fundamentally and widely different groups of concepts. Words represent categories of analogous concepts, and the relevant categories in human life are nothing like the relevant categories in programming. In Haskell, 'functor', 'applicative functor', and 'monad' are highly relevant categories. They pop up everywhere and can be leveraged with great benefit. In human life these concepts are far less common, and thus do not merit words in the common vernacular. Were we to use a programming language modeled on English, we would miss the benefit of these abstractions, trading them for categories like 'dog' and 'car' which have very little practical use in typical programming.",1368303514

5691945,comment,5687359,5689837,3,0,jonnathanson,,,"Retailers segment their customers' trips to the store in much the same way a tech company segments use cases. So-called ""stock-up trips,"" typically conducted after the first payday of each month, are when customers go to the stores to -- as the name implies -- stock up on groceries and supplies for the coming two weeks. ""Fill-in"" trips are ad hoc trips to grab specific items or meet needs that have emerged since the stock-up trip. A second stock-up trip typically happens around the second payday of the month. And so forth.<p>Shopping behavior -- particularly shopping behavior among segments of the population living paycheck to paycheck -- follows very predictable patterns like these, often by necessity.<p>Now, let's put this into practice. I'm managing a regional grocery chain. Let's say it's Kroger in the Midwest. I want to win customers' share of wallet on the payday stock-up trip, so they'll go to my store instead of a competitor's (let's call that competitor Meijer). I'll time my sale accordingly on key items (often these are ""price indicator"" items that signal price superiority over other competitors in the area). Meijer will be timing its sale the same way, and so a lot of game theory and competitive intel will come into play here. But this is why grocery items and household necessities are cheaper at these big chains two weeks out of the month.",1368303179

Is it reversed, i.e., the add-on from toolness.org is tracking these websites, or do these sites have sort of counter-measures to see when people use privacy tools? Can they actually read in information from non-https sites? Also, twitter seems to be tracking behavior on a number of sites. Is it because of those small twitter widgets everyone uses on these sites, or is twitter actually trying to collect data on what I like to browse?",1310165962

It's very hard to fight away that feeling, but I can see the trance people go into when I cut away the ""truthful"", disclaimer-ed, somewhat more equivocal and/or safe speech, and start talking like an expert, like I believe I'm an expert even if I don't believe it - I see people fall into a trance and I'm selling them.

2744435,comment,2742303,2744353,4,0,zinkem,,,"What people can do and what they do do are a little different. I can't think of anyone who stopped building their rig at $3k, but it's possible to produce demo-quality records with a $600 computer, a nice A/D/A converter and software like Reason, or Ableton. All of which can be purchased with $3k. I personally own about $10k of recording gear and instruments, and I've never made a penny off any of it and don't regret the purchase.<p>That aside, the guy who recorded the ""Owl City"" records started out by releasing tracks from his parent's basement while working at Coca-Cola. Imogen Heap I think started off on home recording gear and recorded her entire first album herself. Also check out YouTube for Ronald Jenkies, that will give you an idea of what you can accomplish with a modern workstation, which will run you $3k new, decently equipped.<p>Edit: It has also occurred to me that if you're a band, and you can perform your music well (everything in 1 take), you can probably buy enough studio time to get a good sounding album for under $3k. I can't think of any specific music this applies to, but a great deal of grunge music in the 90s was recorded in this kind of a scenario.",1310165820

2744411,comment,2743894,2744357,2,0,rbarooah,,,"Depends on your definition of singleton.<p>In java, singletons are enforced by the type system - i.e. There's no public way to make more of the object.  Usually that's what people mean by 'singleton' in java.  If you don't have the source and you outgrow the single instance, there's nothing you can do except stop using the class.<p>In Objective-C, people do occasionally simulate that by mungng init and alloc, but that is definitely a bad idea.  More often a singleton class will have a conventional init and alloc, but have a class method like +sharedInstance which lazily instantiates and dispenses a single instance of the object during the lifetime of the application.  That's what people most often mean by 'singleton' in objective-c.  It's basically a global variable, but when you outgrow it, it's often not hard to switch to allocating more than one.<p>Also, partly due to what many would see as a deficiency - the fact that it's much harder to produce architecture independent libraries in objective-c than java, the source is available more of the time, so evolving past a singleton is more often straightforward.",1310165332

Stability is a prerequisite to entrepreneurs getting interesting things done - remember the recent article here about Argentinian entrepreneurs and the crippling effects of a currency that collapses every decade or two?  Stability means, to pull from PG's essays again, that honest accumulations of wealth won't be plundered.  Stability of that sort is a prerequisite to rewarding entrepreneurship - and that sort of stability is disappearing in the US, generally on account of the very same people who are responsible for disconnecting effort and reward at typical corporations. The financier class (and the political class that they have purchased - in this regard, the last four US Presidents are clones of one another) is eating everyone's seed corn. That's deeply harmful to those of us who want to have our labor judged by the market, because without stability and the rule of law, it is impossible for markets to operate efficiently.",1310163480

However, a close listen to the video makes it clear that's <i>not</i> what the project purports to do. The Lifelens ""hardware"" -- the lens -- is just meant to give a phone camera microscopic capabilities. How well that works isn't too clear, but it's definitely not the same thing.<p>It would actually be quite difficult to get an acceptable specimen on a tiny lens. The standard laboratory method is to place a drop of blood on a slide, then use another slide to draw it out into a thin film. Here's a quick video that shows a pretty good example:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA6ce-3sYgk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA6ce-3sYgk</a><p>Note how the tech drags the slide back at an angle over the drop, then pushes it forward almost immediately. It takes good timing and a lot of practice to get it right, and then you have to find <i>just</i> the right part of the specimen for a proper analysis. What you get in a typical thin smear is a range of population densities, from a clumpy mess of cells crowding and overlapping each other, to rarefied lines and clusters of cells spaced widely apart. The nice, evenly spaced fields shown in the article are just a small region of the full sample, usally a couple fields behind the feathered edge. Getting that is a challenge just in the laboratory. On a tiny lens in the field? I'll believe that when I see it, and this is just the second step! (Getting the sample is the first) The specimen still has to be stained.<p>While RBCs with their hemoglobin do <i>en masse</i> make blood red to reddish-purple, individual red cells don't actually show a lot of color without staining. Nor do white cells; they just look a bit larger and grainier than reds. To better examine cell structures, a stained specimen is needed. The standard analytical sample is a Wright stained thin film smear, which requires three different stains be applied and washed in sequence. This stuff doesn't just wash off, either, so don't expect to use the same lens twice. Again, however, that's not what the project actually claims to do. What it <i>does</i> claim, on the other hand, strains credulity in other directions.<p>Sad to say, but a half-sphere lens on a phone camera does not a microscope make. Without going too deep into details (I hope), proper microscopy requires close attention to the properties of light and lenses. You can't just point a powerful lens at a specimen and expect to get a good image. You also need to ensure sufficient lighting, proper contrast, and <i>control your depth of field!!!</i><p>I cannot emphasize that last point enough! Even squashed nearly flat under a cover slip, any specimen you examine is still three dimensional, with details you can only see by shifting the microscopic stage up and down by <i>very</i> small amounts. The depth of field is very narrow. A professional scope's fine adjustment is fine enough to shift focus on a cell from ""front"" to ""back"" and anywhere in between. As you might imagine, that requires keeping the stage very, <i>very</i> still. That's why scopes <i>have</i> specimen stages. You won't get that out of a phone camera without clamping it down.<p>That's what made the article's statement so interesting. If an acceptable specimen could be obtained by smearing the lens directly, the fixed position might allow for proper analysis, but that's not what the project purports to do.<p>It might be interesting to see where this project goes, but at this point, it's still looking very alpha to me. I'd wait 'til they show this thing in action.<p>EDIT: Minor spelling error.",1310163208

That post was not in good faith - it wS someone objecting to the content of my posts, by attacking the tone. Your post struck me as more of the same, if that wasn't the case, I apologise.<p>Anyway, your point is still wrong. Judging someone as not sexually attractive is pretty much the opposite of sexual objectification, it's a refusal to treat the person as a sexual object. I might be perfectly willing to have a relationship with fat bald guy as a cOlleague, or as a tennis partner, or as a friend - I'm not denying his humanity, I just don't want to sleep with him.

They seem to confuse ""new user"" with ""regular user"".<p>Case in point being the new groups design.  Huge buttons to create a new group, an action that happens very infrequently for me.  Plus a huge splash screen with product information (similar to the Blogger blog in the reading list) which as a regular user, I just don't care.",1310162507

My job cannot be my life.<p>2) The more I love something, the easier it is to burn out in 2-4 years.<p>If you find yourself doing something you really love, pace yourself and don't let it consume your life, and your love will live long.",1310162486

It's just a matter of me dedicating the remaining time I have that I don't use for the startup, so that I'll have more time for the startup.<p>I take time off, and I'm really not stressed. In fact, I maintain a rigorous schedule of working out and running, and eating healthy.<p>I also don't drink or smoke even though most of my friends do(most of them were in College).<p>Thanks for the tips, but I'm really not impatient, and each step I take is carefully planned.",1310162414

I don't think the branch libraries have coffee.<p>* Los Angeles Central library has 2 restaurants inside the main library building (Panda Express, and a sandwich counter), and a pricier white-tablecloth restaurant in the garden in front of the building.

3608906,comment,3606380,3608851,3,0,fijal,,,"Right. I think we actually violently agree with each other on that :) Note that in general it's ok to not write much python and live very happily just using it for non-performance critical parts. No doubt we both know a lot of people who are quite happy with that.<p>The problem with numpy's performance is twofold:<p>* Numpy expressions might not be fast enough. I believe you guys at continuum are trying to address that one way or another. In general the kernel expressed using high-level constructs in python <i>should not</i> be slower than an equivalent loop in C.<p>* Sometimes you actually want to write a for loop, because you don't care, because it's faster, because it's a single run, because the data is manageable etc. You should not be punished for doing that with 100x performance drop. You can still be punished for that with 2x performance drop.",1329638167

That is the low-level control flow construct dating from the age of assembler.  Instead, what scientists generally want to say is, ""Apply this kernel across this domain, with these windowing conditions"", or ""Reduce values from this computation along these keys in my dataset"".

Sure, older models, CRTs for the most part, but people don't seem too keen on comparing what kind of TVs are around. So some of these incredibly poor swamp-dwellers have TVs, in an area where there are frequently no lights once the sun goes down.

</code></pre>
All I'm getting at here is that today we have a single university system that generally operates a certain way (a policy that everyone out of high school should enter one of them, and at each university, students attend four years of classes graded A-F, then potentially attend grad school, and  the university also houses researchers/professors), and there's nothing intrinsic to learning or doing research that requires all of these things. In other words, there could conceivably be a variety of different institutions that lacked one or more of the characteristics I mentioned, but it's hard for that to happen when the current system is so fully entrenched and subsidized. We could see more research-only labs, more teaching-focused institutions that have their own unique approaches (a la charter schools, Montessori, etc. in K-12), more institutions that integrate learning and research in a different way, or other arrangements I haven't thought of.<p>One example of something like this is simply universities 100+ years ago, when not everyone was encouraged to attend university. We all know about places like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC. I see no reason more variety is not possible.<p>And you're right, replacing it would be hard, but one reason for that is all the money going into the system. What you're asking me to do is sort of like starting a car company while General Motors is being bailed out by the government. Still possible, I suppose, but more difficult when the other guy is being subsidized.<p><pre><code>  > Recently a lot of academics have been pushing for open journals, even going so far as to boycott closed ones.

Yes, this just shouldn't be controversial at all. In the context of a library, where the whole point is that everything is open, it certainly wouldn't make sense.<p><pre><code>  > Sold by whom?

</code></pre>
I'm sure most professors are aware that not all university research is useful. But in principle, every Ph.D. thesis is supposed to be original and worthy of publication. We know most of them aren't really so great, but in theory they meet a certain standard. When you hear people push for more govt. funding for university research, you won't often hear them say most of it won't be useful. And anecdotally, I've seen a lot of people who are urged to get a Ph.D. without regard to the usefulness of what the student would be doing.<p><pre><code>  > It's not only about privilege: schools are known by foreigners as a system that allows them to get to the US.

</code></pre>
What I mean is that if we had, for example, plenty of world-class research labs that were able to ""hire"" people into the country as easily as universities can admit foreign students, they'd still want to come. The bias you mention is understandable, but someone who'd worked in an American research lab wouldn't be affected by the ""foreign school research"" problem.<p><pre><code>  > Oh man, I'd really love to believe that, but I just don't see it.

</code></pre>
You're right that it's often important for people to do research together. I'm just saying there are other ways to bring people together for science. Will your average local library suddenly become a major scientific center? Probably not, but I can envision something like a modern-day Library of Alexandria where great research happens, and I could see something like that being better than today's universities.

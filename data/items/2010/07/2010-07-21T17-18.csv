I'm genuinely curious why you think this, because based on what I can see, the market is vastly more efficient today.<p>In the past, you'd pay a market maker 1/8 or 1/4, and even then only in thickly traded securities. In thinly traded securities, your order might just go unfilled. The market makers were humans with a physical seat on the trading floor rather than a server in a colo and you'd pay your broker $100/trade (assuming you could get him on the phone).<p>Now you pay a $0.01-0.02 spread, maybe $0.10 on thinly traded securities. You pay your broker $0-$10/trade and you can trade from your N1 or iphone. A colo server is also much cheaper than access to the physical trading floor.<p>HFT provides value: liquidity and immediacy. If you don't believe that is worth $0.02, you can place ALO orders and you won't need to pay for it.",1279735145

1535929,comment,1535841,1535841,0,0,samstokes,,,"I've argued in the past for 'const' being a feature of C++ that would add value to other languages, but this article shows it's a more subtle and confusing abstraction than it appears. I'm not convinced the abstraction actually leaks - both the author's complaints are examples of ""things you thought const guarantees when it doesn't"" rather than ""ways to circumvent what const guarantees"" - but it doesn't mean what you'd instinctively hope it means. (I feel this oblique Princess Bride reference is justified given that, if you say 'const' in any part of your program, you really do have to keep using that word.)<p>With all the talk of ""support for immutable datatypes"" I hoped Scala would do more to support this sort of programming - e.g. statically guarantee a function didn't mutate its arguments - but it actually offers less than C++ did.  Forcing you to make the val/var choice for each variable is a nice improvement over Java's ""mutable unless you go out of your way"", and having performant immutable collections solves a common case (final reference to a mutable HashMap); but you're still basically relying on code inspection or documentation to tell you whether a given class is immutable.  Having the type system able to tell you that would help both the authors of a class and its consumers.",1279735084

We built sites using ASP.NET, Perl, PHP and JSP.  Java and asp.net were tied for worst experience ever.  Setup and configuration of the Java stack was 2/3rds of the project.  And, that's after taking 2 years of Java in school.  Setting up a Java stack on a Ubuntu or a Windows box was equally as painful for me at the time.<p>My experience at school as made me loathe to try anything Java related.  And, while I love the idea of the jvm, I have a pretty visceral emotional reaction to anything java related.  I know it's wrong, but I can't even bring myself to do the installation required to mess around with Clojure or Scala.<p>I get the same vibe from a number of young developers I come across at Hackers and Founders SV meetups that have recently graduated from school.  Someone mentions Java at our meetups  and everyone at the table groans.<p>Python and Ruby are essentially lingua franca here in Silicon Valley startup culture, with C and C++ mixed in for speed.  I've settled on Python/Django for day to day dev work.<p>In my case, even though Clojure and Scala look really sexy.  The thought of installing a jvm based development environment makes me break out into a cold sweat.

At the time the quote was first coined they were considering ""premature optimization"" to be the use of ""inc eax"" instead of ""add eax, 1"".

1535878,comment,1535681,1535681,0,0,10ren,,,"My opinion. It's partly because teams who do webapps tend to be small, young and agile. First, prejudices: they prefer new things (Java is old); they dislike the environment that is Java's home (big enterprise) and the practices and personalities types that go with it (perfectionistic, professional, conservative).<p>Second, real reasons: Java is verbose and statically typed, and therefore it takes more work to make changes - it is slower to develop in and less flexible/agile. These things really count when you want to try out an idea; and when you need to adapt it. There's also a community effect, where all those early adopters are working with Ruby/Python, that's the platform cool stuff gets developed for (eg. sinatra, github, haml).<p>Technically, it's possible to write a sinatra in Java (I have; using annotations for urls); but who would use it? I actually love Java myself, including its static typing, and use it in my startup. But when I've played with Ruby - even as a novice without knowing the tricks - I found it much quicker to develop in, and the code easier to understand because less cluttered. It's probably not as reliable; and the code doesn't run as fast; but these things just don't matter for prototypes and early versions.",1279734036

The languages that one can make on top of it are perhaps rather specialised to text markup, but I think it's telling that LaTeX (<a href=""http://www.latex-project.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latex-project.org</a>) was designed, not by fiddling with the source, but rather as a macro layer on top of TeX.  LaTeX's not little by any means, but I think it would be hard to find many other examples of such successful languages implemented literally <i>on top of</i> existing languages.<p>Finally, I'm not really familiar with Perl 6, but I'm pretty sure it's still dynamically typed.

First I was planning on CS / Math, but wound up taking a physics course, asking the right questions, and the professor hired me to do research for him and put me on the honors track. As long as I was matriculated as a physics major, I had a scholarship and a pay check waiting. I also happened to love it. Because my University didn't allow more than two courses to overlap between majors, I wound up taking enough math courses to otherwise have majored in it, but it didn't count.<p>In my senior year, I took philosophy to satisfy a writing requirement. It was analytical philosophy. Logic and reason was valued above all. We discussed the problem of other minds, philosophy of religion, and a broad array of other things I had always pondered. In fact, I thought I must have been the only kid in kindergarten wondering how I could be certain that my parents were actually conscious beings and not just bags of molecules. How could I know for <i>certain</i> that they had a mind and consciousness in the same way that I did? When I found out that you could get paid to think about these things and teach people how to think, I was hooked. I decided to double major, and spent an extra year filling all of the requirements.<p>After graduating (the first time) I spent 6 months working at a local bookstore, deciding what track I wanted my life to take. I could teach high school physics, I could get a PhD in physics (though I was getting tired of seeing divs, grads, and curls every time I closed my eyes). I could become a philosophy PhD and later professor, which sounded like a dream job, but was difficult in practice to obtain.<p>Then it occurred to me that I didn't know much about biology and my own body. I would be stuck with it for the rest of my life, so I thought maybe I'd go to medical school. The problem was two-fold. I didn't meet the pre-requisite coursework for applying, and my grades were not competitive (I never handed-in homework. I studied things for their own sake and not for the grades.)<p>After watching a few UC Berkeley lectures on chemistry and biology, I decided I loved biology. I returned to my University to get a degree in some form of biology. I wanted to learn it very well, get great grades, and I chose the hardest sub-discipline with the fewest students: molecular biology and biochemistry.<p>I was amazed to discover that when I actually tried and cared, I was at the top of every class. I graduated again, with a 4.0 and applied to medical school.<p>Amazingly, even with these credentials, a large body of research, and a very competitive MCAT score I was still only accepted to a few schools.<p>I wound up getting into a combined MD/PhD program, which was an additional 3 years over regular medical school, but allowed me to conduct research. It also came with full tuition and a stipend.<p>I'm now in my third year and doing research at the NIH. I have five more years until I graduate for the final time.<p>In retrospect, I could have forgone almost all of college and just audited the courses that interested me. In fact, I believe that college is of only marginal value to most people. Most of the skill set I acquired I learned in high school, on my own, with books and computers.<p>Without college, however, I would never have gotten into medical school. It is definitely necessary for some things.",1279732528

But that's fine, I also know plenty of people that succeeded.<p>Failing at a start-up can do a lot more to you than just costing you some money and some time. It can wreck your relationship with your significant other, your children, your family, your friends and so on. It can cost you more than you could afford. It can put you in debt for a long time to come.<p>Whether or not this happens is related to how hard you're trying and at what point you throw in the towel. Fail fast is not just a way to tell people to iterate, it is also a way to remind you that if you fail you should fail in such a way that you don't end up losing more than you can afford.",1335092355

3874522,comment,3874324,3874324,29,0,SeoxyS,,,"You're comparing Java to Clojure. Conceptually, they're insanely different--Apple and Oranges, really.<p>Clojure, Lisp, and similar languages are homoiconic. That means they're beautifully suited to an interactive environment such as that provided by LightTable. Conceptually, unlike typical IDEs, LightTable is not a series of scripts that will attempt to help you deal with common development tasks such as looking up documentation and refactoring. Instead, you're interacting directly with the language.<p>I think it's quite telling that in Java, documentation is done through Javadoc comments, which are ignored by the compiler and sought out by a completely separate tool in order to build docs. In Clojure, documentation is part of the homoiconic code itself:<p><pre><code>    (defn my-fn
      ""This is the documentation, can be inspected on the fly""
      [] )
</code></pre>
Instead of being a series of very reliable hacks on top of a language that doesn't support docs, docs are part of the environment.<p>Additionally, when programming in Clojure, you can do it interactively by modifying the environment on the fly. This was popularized by smalltalk, and is an extremely gratifying way to program: you can inspect and edit your program code while it's running, and have a fully-featured REPL into your program. This way of doing things blows GDB completely out of the water.<p>Note also that when coding functionally, files are often made up of many small single-purpose functions, which is actually much more maintainable than the example ""real-world use case"" function you provided.<p>Essentially, your entire argument is based around the assumption that Java is the right set of design patterns. I would argue that the Java language is deeply flawed, and leads to a 30:1 ratio of boilerplate code, markup, and structure to useful code. It's what makes Javadoc and IDE refactoring tools possible, but it's also what makes Java a nightmare to maintain and (for me) an extremely unpleasant language to work in.<p>I have never used LightTable, but for me, what it represents is a different way of thinking about programming. It's about interacting with your code directly and interactively. And actually, when writing Clojure, I often program in quite a similar fashion with existing tools (VimClojure / Clojure.tmbundle / Cake).",1335091841
3874521,comment,3874293,3874473,5,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"It used to be more common in the past: you buy something, and the fapiao (certified tax receipt) would include some sort of scratch off thing that was like a lottery; so you had some incentive to collect your fapiao and preventing the department store from low balling their taxes.<p>Store owners are not supposed to recycle unclaimed fapiaos, that is definitely illegal, and many companies who follow the law to the letter (like Starbucks) make it very convenient for you to exchange your xiaopiaos (normal receipts) for one fat fapiao in bulk, since they are not gaining anything by not issuing a fapiao.<p>Likewise, Microsoft (my employer, an American company) doesn't require us to play the fapiao game for most of our benefits. However, we need fapiaos for any expenses that occur in China, while there are a few benefits that require fapiaos (a travel and gym benefit) that are easy to get and one foreigner-only benefit where we can get back our tax on rent if only we could ever get our landlord to issue a fapiao (unlikely, they would just jack up the rent for the taxes they weren't dodging).<p>And let's not get started on getting the name right for the fapiao. It must be in Chinese and it must be the official name of our company. I think for Microsoft China its something like Microsoft (China) Limited, but all in Chinese characters, and its bad if you can't write that down exactly right.<p>[Edit] Let me describe the fapiao game: your company (usually a Chinese one) low balls your salary (say 2 or 3K RMB a month) but allows you to claim lots of personal expensive as business expenses. Even more fun: some require you to collect fapiaos but don't reimburse you for your expenses (universities do this a lot!). Fapiaos now require the name of the company that will be claiming the tax benefit so you can't just exchange them with your friends, meaning you need to be diligent about collecting fapiaos. Taxi fapiaos are the easiest, as they don't require names (so you can collect them and exchange them with friends if you want).",1335091833

They <i>usually</i> didn't do this, but I've never had that 'did I just stick my finger into a bear trap?' feeling with anything else, even other electric typewriters.<p>The observer, of middle 20th century American desks, might think that the solid oak frame and general bombproofedness is at attempt to convey solidity in the person behind the desk, a psychological trick.  They may be that, but they are also built the way they are because people typed on them with these things, and lightly built IKEA desks could very easily shake themselves to bits.  I recall a story involving a typewriter lift in the side of one of these desks, of US Navy vintage, whose massive spring was calibrated for some ridiculously heavy typewriter--possibly a Selectric.  When the typewriter itself was on the platform, it rose smoothly and gradually to a working height.  When the platform was unloaded or loaded with, as I recall, a CD collection, the right word for what happens next unless you are extremely careful is ""catapult"" or possibly ""major concussion and several months worth of dental work"".<p>No keyboard has ever even loosely approximated this unless it was also connected to a typewriter (the TTYs and whatnot).

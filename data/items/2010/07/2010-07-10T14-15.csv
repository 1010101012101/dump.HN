Also, as I said, I would like to use a combination of Python and C. That's for a reason. The JVM does not have structured value types (structs in C). All structured types in Java have to be referenced, which is the reason why Java software eats so much more memory than software implemented in C, C++, C# or Go. Maybe PyPy can work some day, if they can catch up. That day is definately not today.",1278773887

Doesn't mean it's more important.</i><p>In the long run, there are far more values in curing ravaging diseases in Africa than there are values in curing bald hair men, at least to me.(Less disease ravaging means more time for educations, which might mean economic growth, which might mean bigger markets) For a corporation, it might make more sense to cure bald men instead of people in Africa. But it doesn't make sense for a charity organization to cure bald men instead of people in Africa because of their different aim.<p>Private research doesn't have to be profit...err <i>money driven</i>, but it can be done for err..noble reasons.<p>What to prevent billionaire from spending money on non...errr..profit research. Indeed, you would expect millionaires and billionaires to donate money to causes that seriously affect their life, whether it is themselves or a love one.<p>So what if it is viewed in economic lights? You're only looking at it in one perspective, which is how to make a lot of money. What you did forget is the true motivations why humans pursue money, like being able to live longer, have fun, being curious, have sex, etc.",1278773768

Most areas with active public sponsored research are also areas that require degrees to start working in.

But what about research that does not have a direct impact on the economy? What about the Hubble, or supercolliders? What private company would fund those?<p>Or, the best example I can think of, is about a therapy for panic disorder (a psychological disorder). There is a remarkable effective talk therapy for panic disorder which cures 80+% of the people who have it, and those people stay cured years after they complete the therapy (and there is no evidence it ever returns). The most effective drug treatments cure much fewer than half of the people, and once those people stop taking the drugs, the panic tends to return. The studies comparing drugs and talk therapy are incredibly expensive, and almost all of them come out of England, paid for by the government. What private company would ever want to fund that sort of research? They have an highly profitable drug treatment, which is effectively addictive (if you stop it, the panic returns)? Why would they spend their own money to research a course of therapy that lasts 8-12 weeks and is then done?<p>I don't think private research is a bad thing at all. But private research is profit driven, and there are some really important problems out there that don't have a big financial payoff once they're solved.

Let me spend as much as I want for ads on certain subreddits/geoips. Make a system that sets the price by bidding, and that allows flagging/voting on an ad. Then advertise it.<p>It's incidentally what I think 4chan is missing too. Not necessarily for /b/, but the domain oriented boards coupled with some geoip would make for some pretty targeted ads. I think it's a pretty big loss not letting the little guy spend his $100 if he wants too.",1278771304

However, if you study his work, you will find that this notion is indeed carried out in the words and actions of his protagonist, Socrates.<p>For example, and maybe the best example: Socrates, laying on his back as the numbness and cold from the hemlock worked its way from his legs upward after willingly drinking it, removed the cloth that had been laid across his face and said ""Oh... don't forget to sacrifice a cock to Asclepius for me..."".  This phrase, which was also used by Steinbeck in ""The Moon is Down"" in a similar context, is taken to mean ""please go an make an offering to the God of Ailments & Cures, as I have been cured of the curses of the physical world by death, and am going to a much better place...""<p>Also, Plato's take wasn't that the physical world was ""bad"" so much as it was composed of imperfect instances of the ""Forms""; Reality as mere shadows and projections of purer, more abstract concepts.<p>I take slight issue, however, with you denigrating ""secondary materials"" with a broad stroke.  There are some really very good, objective analyses of Plato (Vlastos, et. al.) that actually provide a great deal of insight from time to time by explaining some of the idioms and pre-conceived notions of the time and culture that are necessarily understood to be placed in the proper context to understand the dialogue.<p>For my 2¢, I say to the OP: Wittgenstein.  The ""Brown"" and ""Blue"" books.  Very interesting, modern philosophy that deals with semantic meaning and the binding of semantics to syntax and lexicon.  Very intriguing stuff.  Oh, and the guy was a kindergarden teacher, so you KNOW he had balls of steel. ;)",1278771226

They seem more like twitter apps with points attached. These systems are based on the 'honor system' since you can't really prove anyone did anything.<p>There seems to also be a breed of service that is somewhere in between. Where your application does the hard work of determining when a user has earned the points or reward and just tells another service to 'store' that. Our startup originally went down this road but HN quickly gave us feedback and said they didn't like the idea of sites doing all the hard work and then just letting someone else store that reputation data. Now we are more similar to BunchBall in that we actually provide a configurable rule engine which awards the items to your users for you.<p>I think its interesting to see so many companies 'go public' all at once. Like dwynings says on his blog, other companies coming out just validates the market. Now its time to actually deliver something. :)",1278771209

A sufficiently parallelized but otherwise unresearched script could have been created in a fraction of the time. So you would just generate the correct thumbnails on new uploads and then let the batch job run for, say, two weeks. That naive approach will take you around a days worth of development time.<p>The time you gained by doing it the naive way you then put into the rewrite of that legacy component that prevented you from on-the-fly generating the images.<p>What you have done here is, IMHO, wasted time in a legacy solution and you wasted hardware resources for storage of the additional pictures of which probably only a minority will actually be seen anyways.<p>Don't get me wrong: I'm sure you had a lot of fun and there's little more exciting things than seeing your code perform magnitudes quicker than the initial approach.

This is true regardless of how clearly (e.g. Plato) or esoterically (e.g. Kant) written they are. There are some good secondary sources that can help but it's far preferable to be able to talk to an expert in a one-on-one or smallish setting. It would take a long time to explain why this is the case, so I'll just leave it as an assertion here.<p>Okay, that being said, I wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from reading philosophy on their own. Here are some recommendations for books and articles that can be (more) fruitfully read on one's own. Anything marked with a + is a secondary source. Ideally I'd be giving you excerpts from each of these in a reader for a course. I'm going to skip some people like Aristotle who should be approached in carefully selected excerpts or with a guide, and also some more obvious things that almost everyone with a college education has read, like Descartes' <i>Meditations</i> or Plato's <i>Republic</i>.<p><i>On Fate</i>, Alexander of Aphrodisias<p>+ <i>Problems from Locke</i>, Mackie<p><i>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</i>, Spinoza<p>+ <i>The Courtier and the Heretic</i>, Stewart (on Spinoza and Leibniz)<p><i>Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</i>, Hume<p><i>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</i>, Kant<p><i>Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics</i>, Kant<p><i>On Liberty</i>, Mill<p>""Modern Moral Philosophy"", Anscombe<p>""What is Capitalism?"", Rand<p><i>The Bounds of Sense</i>, Strawson<p>+ ""Rawls on Justice"", Nagel<p>""The Naturalists Return"", Kitcher<p><i>Sources of Normativity</i>, Korsgaard<p>This crowd in particular might be interested in some of Frege's work as well, e.g. ""What is a Function?"" and ""Sense and Reference.""",1278770976

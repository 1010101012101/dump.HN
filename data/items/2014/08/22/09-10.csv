8211446,comment,8211329,8211430,1,0,walterbell,,,"A lot of visual apps allow users to draw arrows, but why are people drawing arrows? Is the direction of the arrow significant?  It&#x27;s usually a dependency, e.g. MS Project saying that this task must be completed before another task = time dependency.  A hierarchical outline is another way of expressing dependency (composition).<p>What eventually happens after drawing lots of arrows and creating outlines is that users want to make changes to their diagrams.  But the diagram editor then ignores all those beautiful arrows and the poor user ends up moving singular nodes around and repeating the layout manually.<p>inShort hard-codes a set of rules for a specific use case.  A lightweight drawing tool could still benefit from allowing some operations to be aware of inter-entry dependencies/arrows/relationships, e.g. grouping, change propagation, composition.<p>I&#x27;ll try the app at some point, currently using iThoughts (for fast layout speed on complex maps) on iPad, EccoPro & ConnectedText on PC (supports dependencies and facets).

Even if they were able to overthrow their feudal masters, and later the government functionaries, there still wasn&#x27;t enough wealth to alleviate their suffering (for example food shortages, violence, dangerous and damaging working conditions, no health care...).<p>Today in China this suffering is reduced more and more, despite a growing population. That in itself is a good thing. However, the Chinese don&#x27;t have the amount of freedom we are enjoying. But how do you compare non-freedom versus material suffering?<p>I believe that eventually China will have to establish these freedoms to keep improving their economy. And we are already seeing signs of the limitations: Innovation in China is hard to come by, and corruption on any level is uncontrollable with citizens afraid to speak up.",1408698717

By elections?<p>Turns out, lots of antidemocratic systems have elections, I would even argue a modern dictatorship should have as many elections and referendums as humanly possible.<p>One democratic and one antidemocratic nation might have very similar constitutions, and institutions.<p>Is it then about human rights and freedoms? Human rights are impossible to implement perfectly. There are always compromises. For example, if you want people not to hurt, kill and steal from each other, you better tax them to finance some kind of justice system. But taxation is a violation of the right to property, and policing restricts all sorts of freedoms. What we call &quot;democratic countries&quot; just have a &quot;better&quot; compromise than antidemocratic ones.<p>Democracy being an emergent property solves all sorts of conundrums. Freedoms, and the protection thereof are essential to enable free and fair elections. These free elections are necessary to maintain control of the state aparatus which is necessary to guarantee these freedoms.<p>An emergent property is hard to construct. We&#x27;ve seen how difficult it can be to establish a democratic system from the outside (Afghanistan), and how easy (Germany).<p>The necessary parts of a working democracy (and what are these, anyway?) seem to depend on the other parts to work.<p>But the general attitude is &quot;Let&#x27;s just have open elections, and everything is peachy!&quot; And in a more subtle manner, in Europe people start to view &quot;number of referendums&quot; as the only measure to compare &quot;democracticness&quot;.",1408698228

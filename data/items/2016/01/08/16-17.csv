So, default recommendation for mission-critical apps are mature tools whose strengths and weaknesses are well-understood so pro&#x27;s can use them robustly.<p>Back to beta-phase claim, you&#x27;re saying the core features and compiler of Rust are no longer in development or testing? Totally stable now with only extensions, library features, and optimizations being added? If so, that&#x27;s good news and I&#x27;ll drop that claim in the future. Otherwise, it&#x27;s in the beta phase.

Although this information &quot;will not be collected or stored for any use by T-Mobile USA&quot; -- presumably it&#x27;s only sent to Equifax or some other identity verification partner -- I&#x27;m still not comfortable giving them that information (I believe the only personal information I&#x27;ve ever provided is my name, email address, and ZIP code).

If you &quot;just&quot; a CTO for the startup, then I would follow the more common advice around here to reject it. Even though the experience might be valid, without the funding you wouldn&#x27;t even get that, like hiring and managing other engineers - and trust me, if the founder said May, it will probably come in August at most. And if the startup is successfull you won&#x27;t get the financial reward you deserve. So good experience is your upside.<p>BUT... if you become a Founder, a proper one, reflected in serious equity, not a BS job title, then it is very different. According to YC, less than 10% (before any funding) they don&#x27;t even consider you a founder. So I would negotiate participation between a minimum of 10% and a maximum of being equal any other founder.<p>My opinion would be: founder or nothing. But I don&#x27;t think it is irrational if the decision is: accepting the CTO role, gambling with the funding and considering experience a worthy outcome in the worst case.",1452272221

It works by re-sampling and reducing the video quality in terms of resolution (pixels) and also color fidelity (e.g. octree). The thinking is that people watching video content on their phones will not notice the difference because the screen is so much smaller. The reason a lot of carriers ran afoul of NetNeut is that they were applying it without the consent of the subscriber (for example some would apply it only when their network or a cell site was nearing capacity or for users who were &quot;abusing&quot; unlimited plans (abusing meaning actually using a lot). I am not sure if the user elects to use a service with reduced quality at a reduced cost is really a violation of Net-Neut or not, the cable companies offer regular definition and high definition TV at tiered pricing for example. All the wireless carriers are trying to get into the content business in various ways as the growth of the traditional business levels off.<p>One add on to my own comment is that I forgot is that there is an allegation that Tmo is applying &quot;video optimization&quot; to content other than bingeon, which if true is a clear violation. It also is possible they are just incompetent too because that type of system they are using has to be programmed based on the 5-tuple source or destinations (and some other parameters) which it would not surprise me if they screwed that up).",1452272104

Keep in mind the business model for solar is basically trading higher up front capital costs for lower long term recurring costs, and the capital costs are largely invested into products that have a rapidly declining cost. That sounds like a great plan to me, and while it requires subsidizes today, in a few years it won&#x27;t. Arguably the entire drop in oil prices over the last few years was due to the realization by major players that we will see the end of fossil fuel demand before we see the end of fossil fuels. One of the key contributors to that is unsubsidized price of solar panels was getting very close to the price of oil (~24 months ago).<p>I would also argue, if you do not take care of the externalities of your energy production yourself, than accept that you are going to have to subsidize people that are reducing the demand for it.

These plots generally show a positive correlation between income inequality and various social ills.<p>As a statistician, I would like to comment on the soundness such argumentation: unfortunately virtually all graphs are plagued be a confusion of correlation with causation. </i><p>Reviewer then explains correlation and causation. I could claim &quot;inequality is good&quot; using the same methods.

You can&#x27;t let in hundreds of thousands of refugees without increasing inequality. It&#x27;s not possible.<p>What some of these posts say, without actually saying it, is that oh some types of inequality are bad and some are good. A small local business that earns it&#x27;s owner a 6 figure salary? Well that&#x27;s <i>obviously</i> good. When people say inequality is bad they meant those filthy point-oh-one percenters on Wall Street. Not the plumber who has 10 employees and made $350,000 last year. Obviously.<p>Inequality is at most a 2nd order derivative. It doesn&#x27;t actually matter much. Things can be good with high inequality or they can be bad with low inequality. It gets far more attention than it should, imo.",1452271586

For hosting, profit is almost always a direct function of the level of plan if they&#x27;re priced without specials and you assume the transfer was used to capacity(which was the largest expenditure during that era, by far -- hardware and 1.5 amps to each unit was negligible). Things were different since this was before the advent of bittorrent, dropbox, and ones ability to get 100mb fibre drops to the home from Verizon, but I think he mentioned ~80% of his COGS was bandwidth and unpredicted expenditures (i.e., server maintenance by a tech-- this was when KVM-over-IP units were like $200/mo).<p>His customers fell into a variety of groups though. Some people wanted to host their own domain/mail (again, this was before Gmail), so their consumption was negligble and despite being on the lowest tier, his margins were huge. Then you&#x27;d have people who&#x27;d take the middle-tier deal where the margins were bigger, but people (like my friends and I in high school) would host-jump and max out or bandwidth every month until they TOS&#x27;ed us (unfairly, might I add). I&#x27;d speculate there might be quite a few people who buy the lowest deal because it&#x27;s the cheapest, never log in, and fail to cancel it out of lethargy as it&#x27;s like 4 dollars a month (i.e., the &quot;Godaddy upsell&quot;).

Reading my comment a second time, I&#x27;m not exactly happy with my description, since while it&#x27;s &#x27;right&#x27; is a very simplistic description, ignoring some of the finer points.<p>Since malloc/calloc are generally used for smaller allocations, the chances you can actually avoid allocating some pages you ask for is pretty slim since a bunch of objects get placed into the same page (And thus writing to <i>any</i> of them will trigger a new page being allocated). There&#x27;s also no guarantee there isn&#x27;t headers for malloc to make use of, or similar surrounding your piece of memory, which makes the point moot - Just using malloc triggers writes to at least the first page. So while calloc/malloc are kinda compatible with lazy-allocation, you really shouldn&#x27;t rely on it being a thing, and it probably won&#x27;t matter.<p>It&#x27;s worth understanding, but the chances it <i>actually</i> comes into play aren&#x27;t huge. If your program does lots of small malloc&#x27;s and free&#x27;s, then it basically won&#x27;t matter because you won&#x27;t be asking the kernel for more memory, just reusing what you already have.<p>If you care about taking advantage of lazy-allocation for one reason or another, the bottom line is probably that you shouldn&#x27;t be using malloc and calloc for that then. Just use mmap directly and you&#x27;ll have a better time - more control, you have a nice page-aligned address to start with, and you can be sure the memory is untouched. malloc and calloc are good for general allocations, but using mmap takes out the guesswork when you have something big and specific you need to allocate.",1452271057

On almost any measure you might choose of how well a society is doing, Japan is better. Mental health, drug use, teen pregnancy, violence, divorce, abuse, the whole lot. The same goes across all of the states and countries they looked at.<p>The sheer scale of the evidence is overwhelming. It&#x27;s very rare in the social sciences for literally hundreds of studies to point to the same broad trend across so many different parts of the world.<p>Their work is a revolution as it overturns the common assumption which you expressed that poverty is the problem.",1452270069

Why should they pay wholesale?<p>The power companies (normally) have enough power to supply everyone; they buy that power at wholesale prices and sell it to the customer at retail prices.  So why, if they can always buy power at wholesale prices, should they deliberately pay retail prices instead?  Doing so increases their costs, which then potentially raises rates for others.<p>So, asking power companies to buy power back at retail rates amounts to having power customers pay to subsidize the solar power generated by other power customers.<p>Looking at it as a subsidy, though, suggests a useful way to bring it about.  Many power companies have a program where you can pay extra per kWh for &quot;green&quot; power, paying for the use of wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and other renewable zero-pollution power sources.  Why not use a program like that to allow customers to subsidize solar power if they want to, and use the resulting funds to pay customers higher-than-wholesale rates for solar power?",1452269914

In this scenario you have a few powerful companies taking the pie away from taxi drivers, from small petrol station owners, from small car mechanics, etc... It is a zero-sum game because these people will have to beg on the streets. In this scenario, would the driverless car have helped improve life for humans? Yes it would improve the life of rich people; it will be very convenient for them to not have to drive... But what about regular humans?<p>An alternative scenario would be to tax driverless car companies and give the money back to the people whose livelihoods were taken.<p>I have no doubt that in a fully-automated world, society will either be socialist or communist. If wealthy people start thinking about inequality and actively work to improve things, then we will have socialism. If they don&#x27;t, it will just spread misery and resentment among the lower class and will likely lead to a more dramatic change in the state of affairs.<p>Oppression leads to extremism.

Sony will offer a handful of launch titles that work with Morpheus and maybe let you rent VR movies for $20 a pop.  But when the HMD is just a peripheral, you&#x27;ll get the polished stuff as well as the beta stuff and honestly that&#x27;s where all of the cool software and applications are gonna be for a little while still.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine Sony allowing something like Riftmax Theater or letting you use something like VorpX to simulate playing your games on a giant 3D IMAX screen.  I&#x27;ll never get to enable beta VR support in a game like I can with Steam and I&#x27;ll never get to fire up Unreal Engine and model out some neat stuff, hit &quot;play&quot;, and then walk around it in VR.<p>Basically if AAA games are your priority, Sony and other console-type platforms will be more polished but probably more limited.  If you&#x27;re here as an early adopter with enthusiasm for VR as a platform and eager to try out every new concept or application, you&#x27;re better off with a more open platform for creation and distribution.<p>And as for the cost, needing a $400 video card only applies to some people.  Since I already need and use a computer for lots of things, I tend to spend the extra money on a nice GPU instead of a gaming console for roughly the same cost.  This won&#x27;t apply to everyone but it&#x27;s the market that PC-based VR is after at the moment.  My GPU cost me $100 more than the launch price of a PS4 with no additional peripherals and lets me play any new games (as well as my huge library of older ones) at 2560x1440 with all the bells and whistles.  I think for a lot of people who enjoy gaming and multimedia work/hobby, it&#x27;s a solid way to go.<p>Either way, in 5-10 years it&#x27;ll go the way of much other consumer tech and you&#x27;ll be able to get top performance at mainstream, affordable prices.  The high costs and tradeoffs on various platforms right now will become less of an issue with volume sales and mature hardware/software.",1452269428

Don&#x27;t trust the OS to do stuff for you (closing files, SIGSEV/SEGFAULT ...).<p>KISS KISS KISS complexity is your enemy in C much more than in other languages. Modern C/C++ want you to build complex architecture on libraries that are often bloated (glibc).<p>Egyptians are nice looking.<p>Once you finished coding you have done only the easy part in C:\n- dependency management is hard in C;\n- have a simple deterministic build chain;\n- you should write your man pages too;\n- you should aim at writing portable code;\n- static code analysis, maybe fuzzing, getting rid of all warnings is the last important part.<p>Coding in C is just about 15% of the time required to make great software.

Taxes are historically low, so I&#x27;d be ok with raising them somewhat, but not too much.<p>>> So by taxing the wealthy and spending it on services, we can better ensure that the level playing field you allude to continues to exist.<p>This is really the crux of my argument: instead of increasing taxes first, we should hold the government more accountable over spending and look at programs and how they help or do not help the poor. Poverty is the metric that should be focused on, not inequality. If inequality is reduced as a side effect, all the better. But poverty is the problem. If government got more money from taxes, what makes you think they would use it to effectively reduce poverty?",1452269236

The opportunity cost is that less jobs get created, unique and innovative technology never gets formed, and the ripple effects (such as spurring Chevrolet and others to make electric vehicles) never happen.<p>While not always the case, it is often the case that private capital investments do improve society in meaningful ways.<p>The economy is a very fungible thing and the idea that it is approaching &quot;zero sum&quot; is an unfounded one in the extreme.",1452269171

What Russell/Gödel/Turing/Rice/etc. tell you you can&#x27;t do is write a <i>decision procedure</i> that checks arbitrary nontrivial properties of programs. In other words, if you first write a program and only then ask whether it is correct, you&#x27;ve already lost.<p>Obviously, the solution is to stop writing arbitrary programs. As Dijkstra said long ago, we need to find a class of intellectually manageable programs - programs that lend themselves to being analyzed and understood. Intuitively, this is exactly what programmers demand when they ask for “simplicity”. The problem is that most programmers&#x27; view of “simplicity” is distorted by their preference for operational reasoning, eschewing more effective and efficient methods for reasoning about programs at scale.",1452268875

I was curious about this, and turned to Wikipedia:<p>>In 2006 and 2012, Computerworld surveys found that over 60% of organizations used COBOL (more than C++ and Visual Basic .NET) and that for half of those, COBOL was used for the majority of their internal software. 36% of managers said they planned to migrate from COBOL, and 25% said they would like to if it was cheaper. Instead, some businesses have migrated their systems from expensive mainframes to cheaper, more modern systems, while maintaining their COBOL programs.",1452268858

The workflow for creating a VPS is basically the same right down to selecting an SSH key.  Even the demo video is surrounded by the same minimalist OS X-like window.  It isn&#x27;t a standard library that they both share, but rather a visual copying.<p>It seems tacky to use the same home page.  More than that, I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different providers (Vultr, DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, Rackspace, OVH) and they all have very different control panel interfaces showing distinct development.  It seems like they simply copied DigitalOcean&#x27;s interface as much as possible.<p>Going back to the home page, the second part is a three column bit with info about the service and each column is dominated by a giant icon, just like DigitalOcean.  Next comes the pricing boxes on each.  Both have a &quot;what people have said about&quot; section.  Both put another signup box right before the footer.  Both have the same grey footer.  Even the headers in the footer (like &quot;PRODUCT&quot;) are all-caps like DigitalOcean.  The whole home page is just a rip off of the whole flow and style of DigitalOcean.<p>The fact that they simply ripped off DigitalOcean&#x27;s user interface seems to discredit their claim that they&#x27;re &quot;For Developers Who Care&quot;.  They don&#x27;t care enough to do more than blatantly copy a competitors design (and then charge a premium by mentioning the name &quot;Swiss&quot; a lot).  Cloudscale - For Developers Who Like Making Blatant Rip-Offs?<p>That might sound harsh, but DigitalOcean has worked hard to gain its reputation and trust in the community.  To have someone with no reputation (yet) simply copy their design, possibly out of a combination of laziness and trying to ride DigitalOcean&#x27;s coattails, seems really crappy (especially when they&#x27;re trying to claim that they&#x27;re for people that care).",1452268808

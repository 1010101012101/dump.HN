3446920,comment,3442681,3442681,3,0,alourenco,,,"The article doesn't at all compare the process of immigration between the US and Spain like its title implies. The US has many advantages over Spain in attracting talent, but immigration is not one of them.<p>My background: I immigrated to Barcelona from the US to work for the Spanish office of the same company for which I worked in the US after graduating from college in the east coast. I am from South America. I cannot comment on the challenges of hiring in either location, but I am familiar with the immigration process as an employee. I had a poor experience with US immigration, and a positive one with the Spanish process.<p>The process for applying for a work visa is similar in each country (this is oversimplified): submit your documents and await the decision. For my Spanish work visa, this took about three months. In the US the time between H1B visa application and when you actually begin working depends on the demand for the visa and when you apply; workers who apply before October will start working in October. If demand is high, you may have to apply as early as April. Painting applying for a work visa in Spain as a protracted game of trial and error is disingenuous: hire competent legal help who is familiar with the immigration process for the country or you're going to be running around in circles.<p>Once you have a resident permit in Spain, you are allowed to live here for the validity of that permit, even if you lose your job. Resident permits are valid for 1 year, 2 years (1st renewal), or 5 years (2nd renewal). If you are in the US under a H1B visa you must leave the country within 10 days unless you find another job. This US requirement makes life as an immigrant more stressful and leads you to stick with an employer for longer than you might wish.<p>Eligibility to stay in Spain permanently via acquiring Spanish citizenship is dependent upon the time you've resided here: 2 years for citizens of certain South American countries and 10 years for others (there are two other more specific categories). In the US you need 5 years as a permanent resident, plus the time necessary to get to that point (e.g. +6 months applying for work visa, +1 year working as an H1B until your company is willing to sponsor you, +1 year applying for the greencard). In my personal case, costs for the Spanish citizenship process have been under 500 EUR, while in the US it can easily cost more than $1000.<p>On the topic of Spain not caring if you go to live there: be careful about violating the immigration rules of a Schengen area country, and weigh the benefits of doing so vs the potential punishment (banned for some time? I'm not sure).<p>The header image of this article is much closer to the treatment of highly skilled immigrants in the US than it is in Spain. While bureaucratic, the government in Spain treated me with humanity. In the US, it's par for the course to be faced with gruff agents who seem to not want you there.<p>YMMV depending on the part of Spain or the US to which you're immigrating, the competence of your immigration attorney, and your background.<p>Overall, despite its misleading premise, the article is right in that Spain needs to improve the environment for highly skilled immigrants and startups. However, Spain is hardly alone in that position.",1326203677

3446911,comment,3446779,3446779,3,0,dalke,,,"In any discussion of this sort, I am reminded of an essay by Stephen Jay Gould on baseball. His question, in essence, was ""Where Have the Great Players Gone?""<p>His answer was that in the beginning there was a huge range of skills between players, so those with the best skill easily stood out. But over time, as the game matured, the variation diminished. There were more and more really good people, so the difference between them and the best in the field diminished.<p>Gould's explanation can be applied to any complex new field which undergoes maturation. For example, it also answers the question ""Who is the Einstein of our time"", by saying there are many people who are better at physics than Einstein; so many that they don't stand out.<p>The author of this essay conjectures ""the current educational environment militates against the discovery and nurturing of programming talent."" I disagree. The 'current educational environment' means there are so many well-trained people that the exceptional and self-taught people do not stand out so much.<p>As supporting evidence, the teaching of mathematical physics and of baseball have not seriously changed in the last 50 years, so the author's hypothesis cannot apply to those fields, while Gould's hypothesis does. Hence Gould's has more explanatory power.<p>It may be that the 'current educational environment' is at fault, but there is insufficient evidence for that hypothesis in the essay.",1326203469

He equates Android's failed dream of turning carriers into dumb data pipes, with the worst sort of insidious backstabbing. I'll admit that I was angry when Google sided with Verizon on axing Wireless Net Neutrality, but it wasn't going to happen any other way. Does he honestly think that Google was the deciding factor for the FCC? Does he think that the FCC was going to say no to Verizon, but since Google said that it was OK, they decided to skip on Wireless Net Neutrality? I'm not defending Google's decision, but I'm confident that Apple and Microsoft would have done the same thing if they were in the same position. To pretend otherwise is disingenuous.<p>Also, what does Android being open source have anything to do with his argument? He sneers at Android calling itself open. Why? Sure, Google made a bad decision by supporting Verizon's take on Net Neutrality, but how does that make their source code less open for modification? It may mean that we can't treat carriers as dumb data pipes, but that fact makes Android less open?",1326202432

No other user has ever said that to me about a telecoms company. Not once.<p>And they did rock. It cost 29.99 per month for 2MB/s at the time (2003), which was 4 to 20 times the competition (my brother had a 128kb/s connection, I seem to recall - it took ages to download songs from napster. It kept on getting better, too. Within 6 months I had 8Mb/s, and a year after that 18, then 24.<p>The modem was huge, but it told the time in letters of green, and had its own IP adress. I lived in a tiny flat in the same building as my other brother, so we trailed a network cable across the corridor - enough bandwidth for both of us. We moved to a new flat, and they upgraded the modem, or Freebox (every modem in France is now called *box)<p>That was one of the most successful market disruptions I have had the opportunity to witness. I think M. Niel just did it again. He's turned the leaders of a market into followers, desperately copying his every move. Watch and you'll see.

Your goal at this point is to learn as much as possible about yourself in order to have the most data about what you're good, what you like to do, and what you think you want to do. I wrote a blog post that touches on the subject.<p><a href=""http://dalethoughts.com/2012/01/should-you-diversify-or-should-you-specialize/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dalethoughts.com/2012/01/should-you-diversify-or-shou...</a>",1326200894

The biggest hedge fund in the world, Bridgewater Associates, manages 125 billion dollars.<p>Uh?  I'm not sure what you're talking about here.  Man Investments had close to 100 billion under management at their peak and they're a public hedge (very rare).  I thought Blackrock was the biggest.  They have over 3 trillion under management, though that's everything.  1500 seems small to me given you only need 15 hedges with 100 billion to reach that number.",1326200813

Because for all the other jobs, they will rather take a local and for any leading positions they will definitely not take you and unless you actually have money to invest, they could not care less about you.<p>Considering how I am European, it would also mean a HUGE trade-off in social security and insurance, health care and other things.",1326200710

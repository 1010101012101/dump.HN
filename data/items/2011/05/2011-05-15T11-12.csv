This basically runs as a C http server that understands Perl, running the script <i>within Apache process space</i>. It's pretty darn close to the metal.<p>The interpreter is the sticky part here and something for which Perl gets some criticism in this arena, but the Perl interpreter is also written in C and is quite fast, if not small.<p>Bag on Perl all you like as a language, I know I do (and I use it, as well as Rails), but if you can get past the language hump mod_perl will knock you sideways. You can easily pump out a network card's worth of static content with a leftover desktop machine, and DBI is no slouch when it comes to integrating dynamic content.<p>Slashdot, Valueclick, Craigslist, IMDB...all mod_perl.",1305460632

2549764,comment,2549468,2549468,5,0,ignifero,,,"Facebook platform is only good for games. No other type of app can get traction there, because facebook is an entertainment medium , no matter how hard they 've tried to become more ""serious"". The thing is, it has gotten increasingly off-putting for indie game developers to follow facebook's labyrinthine platform roadmap.  Their platform designs and updates are notoriously amateurish and short-sighted. I believe they have changed 3 platform leads, each of whom introduced a new API. Their weekly code pushes regularly introduce bugs along with the fixes.<p>For us, it's taking more time to adjust to facebook's everchanging APIs, policies, designs etc, than adding features to our games.  The fact that facebook nonsensically banned Adsense advertising does not help either.<p>That said, facebook is still the most efficient amplifier that can provide exposure to web apps.<p>I would personally vouch for another provider that can offer a stable social gaming platform. There were rumors about a google game network, and i m hopeful about it",1305458742

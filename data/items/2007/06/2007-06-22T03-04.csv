29971,comment,29933,29933,0,0,willarson,,,"I like Scala, and I think Lift is very promising, but to answer the rhetorical question, I'd use Ruby because Rails is at a more mature stage in its lifetime than Lift is (I think Lift list just had its 0.2 release). There are some very promising numbers, and developing with Lift is certainly doable (although tutorials and docs are relatively scarce compared to other frameworks), but this may be a good time to harken back to PG's comments about technology firms who bet on the success of Java Applets (I mean, it kind of feels like Lift is a one man production, which means you're relying heavily upon someone who doesn't even know who you are...).<p>
Scala is fantastic though, don't think I'm disagreeing.",1182482571
29970,comment,29919,29967,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"My impression is that everyone wants to get bought.  Even Google tried to get bought first.<p>It's quite possible PG was misquoted -- news reports do that <i>all the time</i>.  I'm not going to try to guess what he ""really"" meant in this article when his own website essays say something different.

29968,comment,29966,29966,0,0,fireandfury,,,"I've read most of Paul Graham's essay's and have read that he was a philosophy/classics major, so I wonder what sorts of books influenced him. I'd like to read a few of the old books too, but I don't know where to start.<p>Here is a constraint for the recommendations:  
-At least one book that is good to start with and not too challenging

29967,comment,29919,29944,0,0,brett,,,"Hmm. I sorta see your point, but I think it's a little more nuanced than that. There's a continuum. I'm guessing he means the bulk of your time should be spent building a good product as opposed to aggressively courting acquirers. If your main focus is on your product then a Demo Day here and there is just good business.

29964,comment,29931,29931,0,0,brett,,,"I'm not sure what to make of all the ""we are going to be high traffic stuff"". A bunch of hype probably inspires you to deliver a little more, but beyond that it seems pretty risky.  I for one am more apt to look for flaws if you've hyped yourself too much where I would have been inclined to look for strengths otherwise. ",1182481230

What you are suggesting is much the same as what I did do - simply missing out the overt portion.<p>It has advantages; it probably saves people being put in awkward positions, on the spot. But it could take longer, and backfire on you personally. And theoretically (I suppose) it could solidify ones own even-more-subtle sexism.<p>This is why I struggle with situations of equality in general. I think the whole issue is a minefield where you are damned if you do, and damned if you don't. And any thought process will end up offending someone.<p>Ultimately the key is to do whatever you do for the <i>right reasons</i>.

Programming, being highly analytical, requires a certain outlook to properly understand and if you're not in that state of mind you might have little luck getting anywhere.<p>I'd argue a good portion of learning how to program is simply in learning how to hold yourself in that state for longer periods of time.<p>The best way to introduce yourself to programming is to start small, build something, but always build it to <i>completion</i>. You learn very little from efforts that don't produce results. Even a ""Hello World!"" success propels you forward a tiny bit. Build on it. Make something incrementally more complicated from there.<p>The best motivator is to have an idea that's compelling. Always start with something <i>far</i> simpler than your original idea, strip it down to the absolute essentials, practice by building parts of it in isolation and later try for a more integrated approach.<p>The other thing that's important is persistence.

3739935,comment,3739566,3739566,5,0,marvin,,,"Hey, I have a question for all you TDD fans. In my (still short) programming career, I have only stumbled across stuations where automatic testing looks impossible to do in a sensible way - deploying a patchwork of code against huge platforms like SharePoint or working with APIs like COM that don't lend themselves very well to testing, and where the code is ""interface"" heavy rather than ""logic"" heavy. Recently I've been looking into iOS development.<p>I also get the impression that most IT work today mainly involves working with huge libraries and APIs, and that automatic testing therefore is hard to implement in a sensible manner. I very much get the idea of automatic tests (and I've wished for them quite a few times, where they've been very hard to implement because the API seems to get in the way). But are there really so many applications for them unless you are building a huge, monolithic application where everything is defined in advance? Seems to me, like a lot of people have pointed out, that it will slow you down when prototyping.<p>This is not a criticism of TDD/automatic testing, but I just don't see how to create good tests when most of your code is just glue between different libraries and most of your time is spent reading documentation and chasing bugs in your library. Would be really cool if someone could point me to an overview of these things. Am I just in the wrong organization?",1332427964

I am arguing for a change to it, and that there are business models that don't require draconian bullshit and law buying. But keep fighting that strawman if you want.<p>I would like to see copyright shortened to 2-5 years for exclusive distribution rights. I would like to see attribution requirements extended to say, 100 years. If you want to use the work, fine, but make sure you mention your work's pedigree. (altho at some point, its going to be either so known and part of the cultural zeitgeist that you don't need it and attribution requirements become a burden, or it won't matter, hence the 100 years). I would like to see unauthorized distribution fines go down to something reasonable, say 200% of the nominal cost at time of distribution + any profits made, and a reasonable fine on top of it (say $100). Since most people distribute for free, we should treat file sharing the same as a speeding ticket not a life changer - the fine system keeps the worst of the offenders relatively at bay. (it is bullshit position to think we should stop every last one of them every last time)<p>As for business models that work: Why do we need to know up front? Seriously, this here is a disingenuous argument. Instead, do like the tech industry does: stop propping up a bad business model with laws, and let the giants fade as better models come along and take their place. As the big companies decline or innovate, new ones will come along and mostly fail, but at some point, one will figure it out.

It has to be based on people acting in their own interests<p>Nobody has ever proposed pure altruism.  We've often proposed a system based on mutual/collective self-interest pursued cooperatively instead of individual/corporate self-interest pursued competitively.<p>Example: the NHS or Canadian health system versus the American health system.  I chose this answer because the answer is <i>really bloody obvious</i>.  You would <i>never</i> think that many small risk-pools competing against each other will somehow yield a better ability to spread out risk than a handful of pools, or even a single large pool containing <i>everyone</i>.  The interest of the individual taking out insurance is <i>clearly</i> to place themselves in as large a risk-pool as they can in order to defray their own costs.<p>So what leaves us with insurance companies and HMOs in the States?  Capitalist <i>dogma</i> that pronounces that Many Competing For-Profit Entities Beat a Single Central Non-Profit Entity Every Time.  But what functions are we envisioning these entities performing?  Those for a capitalist health system are, in fact, envisioning HMOs and insurance companies as businesses <i>first</i> and actual risk-pools <i>second</i>, whereas those for a single-payer system are envisioning insurance as fundamentally being about risk-pools and discarding the goal of profit-seeking entirely in favor of mere cost-recovery where possible.<p>Not surprisingly, each system results in <i>exactly</i> the thing it optimized for!  The American system puts out gigantic profits for insurers/HMOs at the expense of both the collective public (through Medicare/Medicaid) <i>and</i> the individual public (through premiums, deductibles, high prices for medical procedures).

These are the exactly the frustrations I tend to feel as an unpaid, open-source coder.<p>And the next level of the phenomenon is that the <i>entire software industry</i> has shifted its business model to avoid having to compete with piracy or open-source.  There are now, to my knowledge, <i>two</i> major for-profit companies building their own PC operating systems: Microsoft and Apple.  There are four or five building mobile operating systems: Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Google, (maybe) Symbian.  The number of for-profit IDEs and programming platforms is still mostly healthy, but much, much smaller than it once was.<p>""That which is not seen""?  That is, the effect of this privative of profits on the real world?  Almost whole fields have shifted over into the domain of unpaid, spare-time open source work.  Thousands, millions of man-hours are expended for no salary and no equity.<p>Think what would happen if all the open-source programmers (paid and unpaid) went on strike.  <i>Now</i> you're realizing the economic value of open-source code that goes completely uncaptured by its producers.<p>Yes, the result is that <i>less gets done</i>, because everyone has to find day-jobs, and that the software industry has changed almost entirely from product business models to service business models.<p>Now, another scary thought: what if someone stole the code and databases to your web-service?  You say that your contacts and relationships are what really makes your web-app worth something, but frankly, that's a load of crap.  I'm sure there are some starving Chinese coders who would <i>love</i> to steal your code <i>and</i> your data, bring up their own web-service identical to yours (but in Chinese), get a few million users, and then translate theirs back into English for North American and European usage.<p>The ""relationships and business expertise"" excuse sounds much like what everyone said when America sent its manufacturing overseas: ""We'll do all the high-value services and design and development work here.""  Well, no, the manufacturing was <i>itself</i> high-value and the other high-value points in the supply chain eventually followed it, and we're China's bitch now.<p>There is an imperative to enable value-creators to capture some portion of the value they create as cash.

3739827,comment,3739566,3739566,1,0,diwank,,,"Completely agree. Even though I am quite new to coding, I was shocked to see how much more time I spend on debugging a piece of code than actually writing it. The ratio is closer to 3:1 and sometimes even higher. Writing tests has brought that down to roughly 1:1 (varies from project to project).<p>I still don't do as extensive testing as I want to (primarily because I am lazy) but I have seen the shift in the way I think about solving a problem. Writing tests forces you to assign structure to your code (in my case I put it down on paper). It helps you think in terms of ""pipes"" as in what is going in and what comes out.<p>But, I think a lot also depends on the nature of the project. Parsers and frameworks may need thorough tests while simple apps may do without many. And for some people, it may be too much of an overhead at times.",1332426685

Unfortunately, it only leads to more questions, as you seem to clearly understand (Clearly understanding your confusion seems an odd thing to say).<p>Luckily, you were close friends.  This makes things much easier.  This lends weight to my worry about sticking up for other people when they show no signs of bother.  <i>Should</i> I have been offended for Amy?  I don't know her.  As you pointed out, if I did, that would be just as sexist.<p>Let's be clear here, I'd probably feel uncomfortable <i>for</i> the person being denigrated in such a manner.  But what is my responsibility?<p>I mention this because all to often people are quick to say ""Hey, I'd jump in to defend a person,"" and while well meaning, it's just not that easy.  Even women can't agree on this (not that they should).  On one hand, Amy was perfectly content and these things didn't bother her.  On the other hand, in some manner of speaking, they are still wrong. The move Shallow Hal comes to mind here (to some extent, as ignorance isn't the key part here).<p>This leads me to my way of thinking.  Unless it's out right obvious and offends <i>me</i>, I'm not going to rush to the defense of someone because I think they <i>should</i> be offended.  However, I will support people who do come out and clearly state they are offended, and support them.  If they accept the treatment (for example, always taking notes at the meeting) without a word, who am I to treat them like a defenseless child incapable of defending themselves.<p>Supporting the person after they've made it clear they aren't happy with the mistreatment, on the other hand, I think is fair and proper.<p>Some people might feel awkward raising an alarm that something bothers them.  This is understandable.  In some manner, we must encourage them without outright saying ""Hey, doesn't it bother you that you are always asked to take notes?

This is why, though my approach has been gently and justly accused of being ""passive"" downthread, the passivity is the key in this case.<p>Don't overtly ""defend"" Amy. (Or Chuck, or any teamaker of any gender, for that matter.) Don't use the word ""sexism"", don't start doing math on how often each team member has been asked to make tea in the last two years, and don't otherwise call attention to your noble sacrifice (which, as you've seen, in an otherwise-mostly-male crowd serves to throw an uncomfortable spotlight on Amy). Say as little as possible. Just make tea. Try to win the initiative: If you start the job first, it can pre-empt argument over who is going to do it. Or if you lose the initiative, but Amy has interrupted her typing to start making the tea, say something like ""hey, if you'd like to keep writing I'll make the tea today"". (If she says no, don't press.)<p>If you inadvertently attract too much attention, you can make a joke about how much you enjoy tea. Quote some Hitchhiker's Guide or something. It's amazing how useful random whimsy can be.<p>Now, of course if you're always missing from the start of every key meeting because you're making tea the folks in the meeting <i>may</i> be liable to demote you in their minds. This is a sad but true fact of politics: Act like the doormat, and you'll become the doormat. There is a reason why badly-gelled teams tend to try and assign lousy jobs to the person with the weakest political position. So this might not be your final move in this game. But you may be in a better strategic position than Amy to negotiate the necessary change (which could be: rotating the tea-making role through the team, getting catered tea, moving an electric kettle into the corner of the conference room, or just ""forgetting"" to make the tea and seeing what happens: Maybe the team will settle on one of the above alternatives, or maybe it'll turn out that tea just isn't important enough after all to be worth the risk of introducing hierarchy into an otherwise egalitarian team.)",1332426201

If enough big employers can establish this as a standard practice, then pretty soon it becomes procedural. (Like the background check, the drug test, and other procedures that BigCo routinely uses in hiring practices).<p>In a perfect world, sure, you'd love to be able to walk away from a job offer and say ""Well, I wouldn't want to work for any company that subjects me to this...so sayonara, suckers!"" But a) vanishingly few people are in a position to do that, and b) there's a real danger that this practice becomes so widespread as to be unavoidable.<p>While I <i>do</i> think the current situation is being blown out of proportion, I think the potential danger is very real.",1332425979

In Clojure, the complexity of all core functions is well defined. i.e. map is O(n), hash lookups are log_32(n) or better, etc. Seems like you can compute the complexity analysis at compile time.<p>Because your standard for-loop iterating through a collection is a special case of all for-loops.  Much old code doesn't even use iterator-based or comprehension-based for-loops, but instead just iterates through arrays by using a local variable as an index.<p><pre><code>    for(int i=0;i<strlen(string);i++)\n</code></pre>\nThe programmer knows that strlen() will return the length of the null-terminated string <i>string</i>, but without dependent types or some similar computation, the compiler has <i>no idea</i>.  To your C compiler, that string is just another pointer to a character!<p>If we ""move up"" to a language like Java or C++ where iteration uses (gasp) iterators, <i>then</i> we have to detect the <i>special case</i> of code employing an iterator class/type and associate a collection-size variable <i>n</i> with the collection over which we're iterating.<p>I say special case because that check will only catch the employment of an iterator via an iterator-based <i>for</i> loop, not a <i>while</i> loop.  And the <i>while</i> loops or index-based <i>for</i> iterations can also have off-by-one errors and other bugs that will, needless to say, prevent our static complexity analysis from proceeding as planned.<p>These things <i>look</i> easy to analyze to the human eye because Pseudocode is the Sufficiently Smart Language, designed by humans for performing complexity, computability and correctness proofs.

They both still need to be solved, so what is your point?<p>Unreliable services are everywhere. So what's your universal solution for dealing with them? I'll give a concrete example: suppose I have a JSON service being consumed by a Javascript web UI, and my service needs to hit some kind of authentication backend. In the event that the authentication backend server is [pick one: down, giving 500 errors, being slow], what kind of response does my service give to the Javascript app, and what kind of message or visual cue does the app give to the user? If you think the answer is something other than ""it depends on exactly what the application does"", then I disagree.<p>If you think latency is the problem, why are you talking about building in latency? It seems like you actually think chatty APIs are the problem. And, yes, chatty APIs can cause slowness. But chatty APIs often exist because they are the simplest possible design. Once you realize that there is too much back-and-forth you may have to sacrifice API usability and simplicity by adding caching and eager-loading code. Again, you think this is just something that solves itself?",1321401483

We will leave the question whether their prices are reasonable or fair aside for now.<p>Another benefit I get from CC transactions: when I send money to the wrong person or got scammed, I can just have VISA cancel it and I get my money back. In the good 10 years I have been using my own CC(s) I needed to do that maybe 2 or 3 times and it worked absolutely flawlessly.

The very reason you can not just send money as easily and effortlessly as friending someone on facebook is: if you could, your first customers would be organized crime. They cannot wait for new possibilities to launder money easier and faster.<p>I am wondering how they can be moving 50 million a week without all sorts of agencies cracking down on them?

Given a device, say a chip, take the inputs and outputs of said device which defines the machine's behavior.  Now design and build a machine which reproduces such a mapping.  This practice was frequently associated with 'clean room' protocols.  The key point is that the team had absolutely NO access to the source code.

It might very well have been sequentially assigned for some institutions.<p>The 6 digit sort code is unique for the bank <i>branch</i> across all UK banks, generally the branch on record for the account (most UK banks use the sort-code for the branch the account was opened at). Unless you happen to mistakenly enter an account number and sort-code that matches, <i>and</i> you manage to mistakenly enter the name of the account holder for that bank account, they'll usually catch it.<p>The situation is similar across Europe, so if this is a problem in the US, it's a problem of the banks own making, and one easily solved the same way it was in the UK: By adding a sort-code, and matching on the name as well.",1321398253

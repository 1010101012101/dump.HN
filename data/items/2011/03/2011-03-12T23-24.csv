If not, what does it mean now?""<p>I don’t think its meaningless, but I do think its meaning has somewhat been cheapened. The issue is that people are quick to lump early stage companies all into the same boat. There are many different segments within it. We just don’t have words that properly describe those segments.<p>For example, a startup that is ramen profitable is not on the same level as 3 guys setting out to build an minimum viable product. That sounds pretty obvious, but I would bet that a lot of people would say they are both startups.<p>IMHO, it’s not a startup until you have product/market fit. Until then, it’s an interesting project you’re working on with the intention of turning it into something real.<p>That’s the approach we’ve taken. In the past month or so, we’ve achieved product/market fit and have officially upgraded ourselves from an interesting project we’re all passionate about to a startup we’re all passionate about.<p>Admittedly, this was more of an internal perspective, but perhaps this is the type of approach that should be taken.",1299973334

Use strong passwords, or public keys, for all accounts, regardless of how unimportant they seem. A strong password is one with letters, numbers, and possibly special characters, 8 or more characters in length, and is changed periodically.<p>3. Don't run unnecessary services or services with a poor recent security history.<p>Disabling the root login is a legit choice, though if someone figures out your sudo-capable account, you're equally screwed, so use strong passwords always.<p>Changing the ssh port only stops the people who aren't targeting you specifically, and even those people aren't always stopped. It is trivial to scan a host to find where ssh is running, regardless of the port you put it on.<p>fail2ban or denyhosts are OK for preventing brute force attacks, but OpenSSH and most security sensitive software already has timeouts, among other measures for preventing brute force attacks. Which makes fail2ban more of a nuisance-prevention measure (i.e. you see fewer brute force attacks show up in your log reports, and thus making it easier to see the more dangerous threats), rather than a core security measure.<p>If you performed your three steps, but ran an insecure version of any service (particularly those that have elevated privileges), you would still be easily exploited. fail2ban or denyhosts would prevent most services from being exploited due to weak passwords, so that's probably not a hole you'd have. And, changing the ssh port does nothing for you if your system hasn't been updated and is running exploitable services.<p>I used to do security cleanup and post-mortems and data recovery as a contractor for folks who'd had systems exploited. 90% of them were due to running old versions of software, and the rest were due to weak passwords (which may or may not have been prevented by fail2ban; in a couple of cases the exploiter used the webmail client to brute force the weak passwords...most people don't include the webmail client logs in their security considerations, and thus wouldn't configure fail2ban to ban attempts on the webmail client).<p>I'm not saying your advice is not useful, just that it's something you do <i>after</i> you get your core processes in order.<p>Edit: Formatting.",1299971310

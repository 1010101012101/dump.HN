Once skype and other voip companies made it essentially free to call long distance - that whole business of charging exorbitantly for long distance for landlines disappeared.<p>Basically if a business exists because its able to charge 10x for a service and if you can start charging 1x for the same service, then the previous business will not be able to survive in its present state as, usually, it only knows how to make a profit on a price of 10x.

It looks like Apple's first picking on the small guys to try to shake 30% out of the big guys. I don't think that's because it's afraid of legal repurcussions. I think it's because it knows its users would be pissed if really popular apps go missing. Regardless of what Gruber or other people opine, iDevices need apps to get sold.

2330018,comment,2329842,2329842,0,0,micheljansen,,,"This is something that really surprised me about Japanese culture. I went there in 2008 for a study tour and one of the things that really impressed me is how different their attitude towards shared property and public space is.<p>On numerous occasions I saw things where I thought: wow, in my country (The Netherlands) this would totally get abused, vandalized or stolen. Not that my country is not safe or dirty, just that it is individualized to the extent that people place more value on the well-being of themselves and their stuff than that which they share with others or the public space.<p>Some examples:<p>Vending machines are so ubiquitous in Japan that they are an icon in itself. Trash cans, on the other hand, are not. However, you rarely see trash on the streets. Not because there are exorbitant penalties for this, people simply don't do it. People simply drag their trash along until they get to a place with a trash can (maybe their home or office) and dispose of it there.<p>In crowded areas, there are always plenty of public toilets and they are generally free to use. Not once have I seen one that was dirty or vandalized.<p>At one point, I found myself in a packed bus that had one of those old-fashioned destination ""tickers"" made out of a roll of paper with the names of all destinations printed on it. When we still had those buses in my country, they were encased in industry-grade steel enclosures, lest people break the thing or change the destination. In Japan, one could just reach out and do just that, yet nobody did.<p>In six week of traveling through Japan, visiting dozens of places and most major cities, I saw one wall that had graffiti on it. This was so special that I took a picture of it.<p>I think it is too easy to ""blame"" this cultural difference on a ""shame"" effect, as is often done. I spoke to a lot of Japanese people and my impression is quite different. I would say the major reason why there is so little looting in Japan, is that rather than thinking about their own petty interests first, Japanese consider the quality of the public or shared space to be just as important to their personal well-being. In other words: when western people throw their trash on the floor, they think ""Good, I got rid of my trash""; for Japanese people nothing changed, since it is still in ""their"" space, so they better dispose of it properly.<p>Disclaimer: I am by no means an expert on all things Japanese. I was just there for six weeks and this is my impression, I might very well be totally wrong :)",1300233056

Adding a salt probably increases the workload by about as much as going from salted hash to bcrypt [constant time lookup in rainbow table -> exponential time in length of password -> higher constant factor exponential time]. But I must disagree with you saying there's nothing wrong with hashing, however. There is something wrong with hashing, and that is that it's possible to brute force many passwords. However you're perfectly right that going hash+salt to bcrypt doesn't do nearly as much as going from plaintext to hash+salt.<p>And you're also right in that the simple passwords will fall anyways. You could have it take 30 seconds per password and an attacker could still get the passwords a couple percent of your users (who picked '123456', 'password', etc). If I pick '$yN3,A%2vq{-', no matter if the server is using MD5-crypt or even scrypt, you won't be getting my password.<p>> you're going to become CPU bound extremely quickly<p>This is one of the only valid criticisms of bcrypt, and it is a significant one. One of the nice things about it, though, is you don't have to use the 0.3 second time. That's just chosen arbitrarily. If you think that's too high, then go with 0.03 seconds, or 0.003 seconds. Surely you can deal with that requirement. Granted, brute forcing is now 1000 times faster -- but hey, it's 1000 times slower than bruteforcing a hash.<p>Anyhow, I don't disagree with most of what you're saying. I just wanted to point out that it's still possible to go with bcrypt by just decreasing the workload to a reasonable level for your application; I'm not trying to say you're wrong.",1300232956

If (and only if) it matched with the congressperson's political agenda, we could suggest that the congressperson ""push the issue"" in caucus or debates.<p>Although, internet comments and news aggregators would never swing a politician's perspective on an issue (only money does, kidding...kind of).<p>So, there is some political weight in internet comments, but if you really want to ensure your contribution, call up your representative. (Seriously, they have people to handle these calls - it takes 5 minutes.)",1300230079
2329866,comment,2329366,2329515,0,0,Stormbringer,,,"Security is hard.<p>If you're asking for an account name and password form someone, you're effectively committing to playing security hardball.  Also, you're asking the users to trust you, and perhaps the level of trust that you're askign for is more than you really need.<p>Stackoverflow is an interesting case where they thought about issues of identity and authentication, and decided to go with OpenId.  Their rationale would be something along the lines of ""we want to map comments to an identity, but we don't need/care about authentication, we can let someone else do that"".<p>Unfortunately, OpenId kind of sucks, but that's a different story.<p>An interesting example is HackerNews where they keep a cookie around so I don't need to log in everytime.  This is enormously much less secure (anyone else on the same machine can impersonate me just by going to the HN website).  But the security implications of someone impersonating me are low (shoot, given my contrarian nature and history of Iconiclasm and Heresy someone else trying to 'destroy' my online rep would probably actually improve it instead :D )<p>Now Facebook does the same thing, but in Facebook's case this is enormously bad, evil and wrong (tm) since the data they control access to is much more sensitive and private.<p>Speaking of different stories, here's another one to illustrate when you want to be able to uniquely identify someone, but going with a full on username/password system is overkill and more hassle than it is worth.<p>Was talking to some guys who want to take registrations/expressions of interest for an upcoming Science Fiction convention.  The convention is a couple of years out, so presumably some proportion of the people will need to change their address details between now and then.  But if they do a name/password thing, people will forget the passwords (and choose badly even if they do remember it), it imposes a security and trust burden upon them to maintain the database securely.<p>Basically, they need to identify the people to a reasonable degree of security, but names/passwords is overkill.<p>So I decided that what they needed was a shared secret instead.  If the person gives their email address when they sign up (and sign ups range from OMG take my money now to ""eh, send me a reminder when we get to three months out""), then when that person wants to change their name/address details, they just send them an email with a link.  The link contains the shared secret built in (e.g. a token).  The shared secret will eventually expire, but for a while they can get in and edit their own details.  If someone doesn't want to give their email when they sign up, no problem, they just can't offer them those convenience features.",1300230015

Originally, your goal posts were set to ""Japanese people escape unscathed from radiation"". And I suspect the definition of ""large"" will shift accordingly so that you can maintain your view that nuclear plants are safe enough. You had to shift your goal posts because the glowingly optimistic view from your OP hasn't survived reality.<p>Secondly, if that glowingly optimistic view from your OP had actually come to pass (and now we're operating in a fantasy world), why would anyone consider it more than anecdotal or luck or a combination of factors that are not easily quantifiable and therefore hardly reproducible?<p>And lastly, once again you failed to address the point I have been making. Your position applies equally to both sides. You can't cherry pick and maintain any integrity. It's not that I believe failure in this situation is ultimate proof of the failure of nuclear energy - but it is your OP that success in this situation is ultimate proof of the success of nuclear energy. Your premise is wrong, independent of whether your conclusion is wrong (which I believe it is, but not ultimately because of this situation).",1300230008

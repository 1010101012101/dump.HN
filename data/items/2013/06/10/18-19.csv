Namely, that privacy is the right of seclusion. Instead, he advances a broader conception of privacy (from his longer Taxonomy of Privacy) and identifies societal goods from privacy.<p><a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565</a>",1370890615

And hasn&#x27;t been since the Soviets dissolved.<p>As I said elsewhere, the US unilaterally withdrew from the ABM treaty with Russia back in 2002. This treaty had been active since the 70s and attempted exactly that - decrease the amount of anti-ballistic missiles installed.<p>There was no rational reason to put up a whole new defense system in Europe (under a false premise of the Iranian threat). It is in no one&#x27;s interest except the US.

Now this may be a bit difficult to explain, but all the logic in the points above sort of align towards the intent of achieving mass adoption. But I am afraid that mass adoption is not going to happen just like that. And it is certainly not going to depend on the fact that everyone uses email.<p>Let&#x27;s look at an ordinary user first. An ordinary user doesn&#x27;t half understand the subject of privacy. He/she is rather more interested in sharing his/her best looking picture on Facebook. Or worried about landing a good job with a nice new email with all the strengths. Which is the cool app, what is the next device he can <i>show off</i> etc.<p>Why would Persona matter to such a user? A type that is majority and we&#x27;ve counted them all in the statement &#x27;everyone on the &#x27;Net has one&#x27;. So this is more like opening an end of a small pipe to the atmosphere thinking that all the air will pass through it.<p><i>- Most everyone on the &#x27;Net has one.</i><p>Yes. But it doesn&#x27;t provide any motivation for people to go and sign-up for Persona. Hence email registration only adds to friction.<p><i>- Most everyone remembers their email address (but they might not remember what usernames they used for which websites). </i><p>This one is real. Since Persona is about, well, persona it is more likely to remain etched in the memory of early adopters (ignore mass adoption for a later stage) provided it is done right, kept right etc. Mozilla is an amazing and capable organization so it should experiment more given that the project itself is an ambitious experiment.<p><i>- Email addresses are unique, so when a user signs up for Persona, they don&#x27;t have to go through that time-wasting &quot;this username is taken, try this one instead&quot; process.</i><p>Dumb users are dumb enough to try signing up with the same email id again. I am not very sure about Persona&#x27;s positioning w.r.t same person having multiple email ids?<p><i>- Email addresses make it easy to recover forgotten passwords.</i><p>Agreed. However, Hacker News is a great example of why both email id and password recovery are immaterial for a product to be successful (Kudos PG!). I do agree with the simplicity of recovering forgotten password through email, but this is certainly not a show-stopper at this stage.",1370890110

I wasn&#x27;t aware of there being videos, so no, I haven&#x27;t seen those, but I have viewed numerous Railscasts since completing Hartl&#x27;s initial introduction and those are invaluable too.<p>During the tutorial, I faithfully followed almost everything presented, including the extra work (e.g. using Postgres instead of MySQL so that the dev environment matches production more closely). This included TDD and Git. Git has been fairly painless because I have used Mercurial before and they are quite similar.<p>With my side project, that I started right after completing the tutorial, I initially used TDD extensively, for the basics of the model, but once the foundation was laid, I can&#x27;t say that I have kept my test coverage up. I assume my story is not uncommon in that respect.",1370887496

It is about the act of self sacrifice to bring to light the immorality of others. This is a &quot;duty&quot; only to the extent that you believe in democracy and the duty of a citizen in it.<p>As for arguments about why you would ever act, it really depends on the person. Most people are far more pragmatic about what it constitutes for their family to be safe and happy whereas others believe (along with their families) that &quot;It is better to die free than to live in shackles.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve noticed the latter especially among immigrants from regions with a history of totalitarian regimes. For example, the majority of Russians who immigrated here after the USSR collapsed remember all too well what it&#x27;s like to live in an oppressive state. For them, they see history repeating itself and know first hand how arguments like &quot;who cares if you&#x27;ve got nothing to hide&quot; end in people disappearing in the night and neighbors ratting each other out for petty reasons. It is very alarmist but when you&#x27;re born without the cultural trust for government in America, you see things very differently.",1370887489

For convenience, let&#x27;s call him Dick Cheney. President Cheney expands the powers of the office, rewards his corporate friends who bought it for him and generally makes a mess of things. It doesn&#x27;t look like he&#x27;ll get a second term until there&#x27;s another big terrorist attack. He makes his opponents look weak on security, further expands his power, starts three wars and gets re-elected easily. In his second term, he gets presidential term limits repealed, doubles the national debt and starts making journalists who ask too many questions &quot;disappear&quot;.<p>People start to get fed up. They realize the terrorist threat is overblown. They realize President Cheney is more of a threat to the country than any outside entity. A challenger emerges. He persuasively argues for solutions all the experts agree are wonderful. He&#x27;s well-spoken, good-looking, charismatic, entirely electable. He promises to restore civil liberties, release political prisoners and end intrusive surveillance. He&#x27;s expected to win in a landslide. There&#x27;s just one problem: he likes Thai ladyboys. Thanks to PRISM, Cheney knows, and ensures that a friend at Fox News finds irrefutable proof. Cheney wins a third term. The opposition candidate is later found with his throat slit outside a brothel in Bangkok.",1370887391

Substantially crazier than writing your own VM for PHP, which is pretty WTF already.<p>However, i am really surprised that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a plan to gradually migrate off PHP and on to something decent.<p>This would involve creating a viable new platform of some sort (Sinatra on JRuby, Scalatra, Node.js, whatever&#x27;s cool now), working out how to do the interoperation with PHP that was necessary (decoding PHP cookies or whatever), building or porting some minimal feature onto it, getting it into production, and getting it stable. Further features could then be developed on it or ported onto it one by one. Establishing this platform should be much less effort than writing a high-performance PHP VM.<p>There would remain effort in actually porting bits of the site, but that can be applied incrementally. New features could be developed on the new platform at no extra cost.<p>The new platform would probably be based on the JVM (unless it&#x27;s Node), and i would expect it to be faster than HHVM. I would confidently expect it to require less maintenance. Given that the old platform is PHP, i would also expect it to be more secure, and to afford better quality code.<p>My company (a tiny operation in financial services that you&#x27;ve never heard of) is currently going through something a bit like this. We have a monolithic legacy app written in Java on a homebrew platform made of servlets, XSLT, and cheap gin. All our substantial new features are being developed in Scala on the Play framework. Whilst i&#x27;m not certain Scala/Play was the right choice, the plan is working: we are shipping, we are moving faster when developing the new features, and we are crying less.",1370887214

I got the feeling that it was ""meeting time"" and ""argument time"", which is a different thing altogether...it's formalizing the constant interruptions that most work environments have throughout the day into one half day at the end of each week.  So, you save up your discussions for Friday.  It just happens that having meetings and discussions with people you like OK is a pretty low stress way to spend an afternoon, so it makes the last day of the week an easy-going sort of thing.<p>But, I agree that a lot of corporate environments could not pull this off.  There is a point in every companies life where the culture becomes too divided.  Not everyone likes fantasy football, Mario Kart, Rock Band, Medieval themed restaurants, or volleyball, and any formal attempt to get everyone involved in any one of those things is destined to failure and poor morale.<p>A pretty large percentage of people, below a certain age, can agree on free beer, so the ""picking up the tab"" policy is a somewhat safer choice, but probably a less productive one.  Do you really want people discussing business strategery after four or five cocktails over the sounds of the football game on one side and the jukebox kicking out Justin Timberlake on the other?",1220377638

They add in something called ""hedonic regression."" That means if a TV costs the same than it does 3 years ago, it's still more valuable because it has 1080p, and that gets added into GDP, and somehow mystically subtracted from CPI.<p>There's plenty of other reasons why his claim is bullshit, but just a couple more notes:<p>Recessions are not defined as two quarters of negative GDP. Rather, it's a period of economic contraction. We are in a recession. Anyone who denies that is not looking at the same data as I am. Look at employment, housing starts, credit spreads, equity markets, bond markets, credit default swap markets, CPI (both core and otherwise), and number of bank failures.<p>Some better resources:<p><a href=""http://bigpicture.typepad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigpicture.typepad.com/</a>

292918,comment,292776,292776,0,0,mdasen,,,"I don't see it.  DSL is simply outdated technology that's being sold for cheap because some people don't care if their connection is only 1Mbps rather than 6Mbps.  So, they hope to get those customers by being cheaper.<p>Part of the reason we haven't seen changes in price is because of how technology works and partially because of how American businesses work.  For example, upping speed is often easier than lowering price because as technology gets better, you can provide more efficient technology based off those ideas, but the materials and work involved remain decently constant by comparison.  So, they can't give me the 1.5Mbps connection I got when I signed up for cable for $20 as easily as they can up that to 10Mbps for the same $40 I had always paid.  In terms of business, American businesses like offering the idea that consumers don't have to think.  So, even if prices spike for a while, consumers shouldn't see them rise and as prices go down, consumers should keep paying the same.  This leads to companies pricing products to sell them at a loss for a while to regain it on the other end.  This happens in a lot of places, but Americans seem particularly fond of sticky prices.<p>DSL just sticks out because it's an end-of-the-road technology that the telcos can't make better.  So, they package it as the ""value"" alternative and sell it.  Cable internet has seen constant pricing because it's just become faster.  There isn't really a price war so much as different options for different people now.",1220377446

They don't, for the most part, care about other peoples' private jets and designer mansions. (I've worked on Wall Street, but I've never even <i>seen</i> a private jet.) It's because of social and power inequality. They're miserable because they expected to have a fair amount of autonomy upon ""getting there"", but they're still owned by someone.<p>Although social inequality is a bad thing, I'd blame this unhappiness on the dominance that large corporations hold over most peoples' lives, especially in the small world of upper-tier management.

I didn't find anything useful.  Riya seems cool, but there is no way I am going to upload all my pictures.  Picasa web albums requires all the pics online, too.  But, it looks like I might just have to wait a little bit longer and I can upgrade my version of Windows Live Photo (which is actually a really slick piece of software) and get what I am hoping for:

47635,comment,47549,47625,0,0,portLAN,,,"I agree with nostrademons.  Make YC a sideline, not a destination or starting point.  There's great power in taking charge for yourself.<p>If you don't feel compelled, it's because your goals aren't inspiring you.  You need bigger goals.  Possibly getting accepted to possibly work with unknown people on an unknown web app is not interesting enough to capture your imagination.<p>You have to think of something you really want, something that grabs you, especially if you don't know if you could do it or if it's even possible at all.<p>As for 5), have you heard of Pollground?  <p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator</a><p>That said, some great ideas seemed stupid to ""experts"" at the time; just trust your own gut feeling, not anyone else's.  If you don't have a gut feeling, then you probably don't understand what people want in that area and should switch to another one (or steep yourself in the original a lot more).

But we had gone to MIT so we knew what was fun. So, yes -- it has everything to do with investment opportunities.  There are a few companies planning to go to New York for the music companies. (This includes us)",1188340198
47632,comment,47549,47613,0,0,vlad,,,"I'm sorry you've experienced lack of passion in the past and want to share it, but I can't help you here.  I have no idea what that must be like.  I'm looking to take my 4-year-old lone adventure with one product, to a great team effort on something even bigger, always forging ahead without waiting for a perfect opportunity.<p>No matter how many times you post, the team means more than an idea.  Ideas can be changed a million times once you're incorporated, invested, have a prototype, and user feedback.  PG, Max Levchin, and others prefer a team versus an idea.<p>Again, thanks for sharing your experience.",1188340173
47630,comment,47549,47629,0,0,vlad,,,"""You don't really need investors to start something, nowadays, and when you do need them they'll usually be there.""<p>Thanks, but like I said in my post, I would rather get an exciting team together, get the legal and accounting stuff out of the way, and build a trusted relationship with an investor, and put to use what I've learned over the past 4 years.  And none of those people work for free.<p>If it's possible to take care of all that stuff right away, it makes life very easy.",1188340073
47629,comment,47549,47625,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I liked the previous (~4-5 minutes in) version of your comment better. ;-)<p>Anyway, I also think you're right in doing all of the above.  And it looks like you'll find your cofounders, judging from other responses to your comment.  Good luck with that.<p>I'm just saying that even if the investors (including YC) say no, you can still build something, see if people want it, and <i>then</i> get investment.  You don't really need investors to start something, nowadays, and when you <i>do</i> need them they'll usually be there.",1188339309

47626,comment,40222,40463,0,0,luismg,,,"I really appreciate these comments about webpy.
I recently started using it and I love it for its simplicity, but at the same time I wondered about the advantages/disadvantages of its ""anti-framework"" philosophy against the full features of a mega framework ala Django, Pylons or TG.<p>I still find it very appealing, because 99% of the time, it is used for common, simple websites. And in these cases, its simplicity pays off.
I like that I don't have to fiddle with multiple files or configurations, since everything can be contained in a single file in a very clear way, and just adding ""web.run"" to your script converts it into a running website.<p>",1188338725
47625,comment,47549,47602,0,0,vlad,,,""" Apparently, it's not hard to get investors if you're so snowed under with traffic that your servers are busting at the seams.""<p>Yes, I know the hypothetical.  However, I'm talking about reality.  If YCombinator is an option, I'm going to take it.<p>1) I'm leaving my desktop app available so my current customers, 93% of whom of 153 survey respondents say they love it, can access it. I already know I can deliver software that makes people happy enough to pay money for it. I'm just creating a free version and getting it up to distributors to see if it can make even more people happy than I can imagine.<p>2) Finding cofounders on News.YC for a web-based app the team agrees on.<p>3) Applying to YCombinator.<p>4) Working as long as it takes to make a lot of users happy.<p>PG, Max Levchin, and other investors favor teams who are dedicated and flexible versus one specific idea.",1188338640

Had I known I may not have built a recent parts database website with harp.js and a weird mashup of php, bash and even a go sitemap script. Dumping out csv files from excel, iterate through said csv files with php and dump ejs files with part (628 in all) then harp compile followed by an s3 sync for all 633 pages on the site. All scripts referenced from one bash file. I felt clever! But won&#x27;t feel clever when I rebuild my Mac with X number of environments (npm, php, aws sdk, OSG) to build the site. With Hugo and also stout [1] also mentioned here, the workflow is alot more predictable, and binaries could be kept in the project for easy portability.<p>Also worth mentioning is OSG [2], a sitemap generator written in go that I use in my bash script. It&#x27;s very fast. This may have some advantages over hugos built in sitemap generator depending on your site, though I think I would use hugos in most cases. Might be useful for others using other static generators that don&#x27;t support sitemaps and also have other CMS&#x27;s and carts / forums installed too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stout.is"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stout.is</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/patrickmn/osg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/patrickmn/osg</a>",1448859463

However, they used to be called Photo Streams, I believe.  Or at least, they used to be called &quot;streams&quot;, which is probably why I conflated the terms.  I know they were called streams because I just checked my iPhone 4, which is still on IOS 7.1.2, and it says distinctly &quot;Create New Stream&quot;.  On IOS 8, it says &quot;Start Sharing&quot;.

That&#x27;s assuming that the hole&#x27;s motion is approximately equivalent to free-fall motion, which is what you&#x27;re basically assuming--no inter-atomic forces exerted on the hole.<p><i>> gobbling up all the matter within at least a few atoms distance of it&#x27;s path.</i><p>Not necessarily. Even though there are no inter-atomic forces preventing atoms from falling into the hole, the hole&#x27;s gravity is still very small, so the force drawing atoms into the hole is very small. The hole&#x27;s passage will disrupt the forces between atoms in the horizontal direction, but those forces are negligible anyway; the main force exerted on an atom that&#x27;s part of the Earth is in the vertical direction. So the atoms just to the side of the hole&#x27;s passage will start out at rest, and they will only fall into the hole if the hole&#x27;s gravity is enough to pull them sideways into the hole in the time the hole passes.<p>Just to run some numbers, suppose the hole&#x27;s mass is 10 trillion kg (my rough back of the envelope estimate of the mass of Mount Everest). Its horizon radius will then be about 1.5 times 10^-14 meters, or about the size of a large atomic nucleus. A typical atom is about 10,000 times larger, or about 10^-10 meters in radius. Using standard formulas for black holes, the time it takes for an object to be pulled into the hole from rest at 10^-10 meters away is sqrt(r^3 c^2/2GM), which works out to about 10^-8 seconds for r = 10^-10 meters and M = 10 trillion kg. But the time it will take the hole to cover 10^-10 meters, and thereby move out of the way of an atom being pulled in from the side, is only 10^-10 seconds at a slow speed of 1 meter/second (which the hole will achieve a tenth of a second after it starts to fall), and about 4 x 10^-14 seconds at the speed it will have at the center of the Earth (about 8000 meters/second, the same as low Earth orbital velocity). So pretty much the only atoms the hole will eat are the atoms directly in its path; its gravity will be too small to pull in atoms from the side quickly enough.",1448859352

However, this is general and does depends on a case-by-case basis.<p>> <i>Now let&#x27;s say there was a knife to her throat and she didn&#x27;t cry out. Or she was knocked unconscious by her attacker and couldn&#x27;t cry out. God doesn&#x27;t make allowances for those situations..</i><p>God&#x27;s laws and rules aren&#x27;t* absolute (see asterisk below for more on this.) He <i>does</i> make allowance for such things.<p>A perfect example of this is in Galatians 5:18, &quot;But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.&quot;<p>Which says that if you&#x27;re guided by the Holy Spirit, you don&#x27;t even need to follow the law of Moses. You must be careful with this, however, as to not break the law falsely just thinking you&#x27;re guided by the Holy Spirit. God will have the final judgement.<p>This may also apply to such things as the women crying out load when being raped, that if she&#x27;s guided by the spirit, she is not under law to cry out, but more than likely if she&#x27;s guided by the spirit, she will cry out. (If you read the link to Ellicot&#x27;s commentary after the single asterisk, it seems that actually the Jews of Old Testament must follow the law of Moses, but today people of the Christian faith, due to Jesus Christ, _have_ this discretion when led by the Holy Spirit; and so, maybe the women back then would be guilty absolutely if she does not cry out in earnest.)<p>> <i>Now let&#x27;s say... the bible can be oddly specific about other things.</i><p>One parenthetical note which you probably already know, the Bible has real laws and examples for us to follow, yes, but It&#x27;s not appropriate for there to be an asterisk of every example, with every little if statement and reminder how it must be interpreted because that&#x27;d be one long, messy Bible.<p>> <i>I maybe reading between the lines, but it basically says, if she isn&#x27;t heard crying out (in town) then she&#x27;s guilty.</i><p>If she cries out in earnest in town, she wouldn&#x27;t be raped. If, however, she _is_ raped somehow, she is not guilty. In this case, though, I do not know exactly what would happen to her, because it&#x27;s possible that she would be wrongly persecuted. Or, maybe she would be spared by God Himself.<p>If she isn&#x27;t spared by God and she is brought to death by God&#x27;s rules, she&#x27;ll still be judged justly by God whether she goes to heaven or to hell, and judging from [7], heaven is better than [an early] death here on Earth.<p>> <i>All that said, I like the intention of religion. I just hope we can someday replace ancient religion with a more modern one based on reason and not fear.</i><p>It&#x27;s not based on fear like it used to be. Imagine living in Israel in those days, with the idea of being stoned to death for sinning or worse placed in an eternal hell for sinning. That is fear. But since the coming of the Messiah, if you just believe in Jesus Christ, you&#x27;ll go to heaven :)(read below for more on this.)<p>Fear is why people were stoned to death because stoning instilled fear into people who were doing the stoning and the community, as a result, they would fear sin because they witness the terror of being stoned to death. As a result, this created a civil, healthier, happier (, etc.) society both today and back then.<p>> <i>I would agree with that, but then I would extend it to say that time needed religion with an all knowing and active God to keep people in there place. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s needed anymore.</i><p>Yes, and maybe that&#x27;s what God thinks: it&#x27;s better now if He takes a more passive role. Maybe, that&#x27;s why the holocaust happened, because God has decided to let us develop naturally and suffer naturally the consequences for our sins, knowing that good will prevail.<p>However, maybe this is something you can learn from Him yourself, because I&#x27;m not sure myself.

One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”\n\n  Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’”\n\n  -- Matthew 22:37-39\n</code></pre>\nSo,  love your God with all your heart and soul, and love your neighbor as yourself. These are the two greatest commandments.<p>-------------------------- line break ----------------------------<p>* Read Ellicot&#x27;s commentary for Galatians chapter 5: <a href=""http://biblehub.com/commentaries/galatians/5-2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biblehub.com/commentaries/galatians/5-2.htm</a>. From this, it seems that God&#x27;s laws and rules aren&#x27;t absolute if you are a Christian instead of a Jew that is whether or not you believe in the Messiah being Jesus Christ. Also, it&#x27;s a commentary that says that if you believe in Jesus Christ (again thereby Christian) then being circumcised helps you none. In other words, if you&#x27;re Christian, God doesn&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re circumcised, which deflates your previous comment about circumcision.<p>[0] John 6:47 - “Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life.”<p>[1] Acts 16:31 - “They said, &#x27;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&#x27;“<p>[2] John 5:13 - “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.”<p>[3] John 3:16 - “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him.”<p>[4] John 24:6 - Jesus said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”<p>[5] Ephesians 2:8-9 - “For by grace are you saved, through faith, and this not of yourselves – it is the gift of God. Not by works, so that no one can boast.”<p>[6] John 1:12 - “To all who received Him, to those who believed in His Name, He gave the right to become children of God.”<p>[7] Matthew 18:8-9 - &quot;If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire. If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell.&quot;",1448858837

It&#x27;s a direct time sink (time you could be using for marketing or development) and when you&#x27;re getting off the ground it is really difficult to predict how much time it will take. To some extent being &#x27;swamped with support&#x27; is a nice to have problem as it implies that you at least have customers or at least people trialing your product.<p>So, it is with a fair deal of surprise that I&#x27;ve come to really enjoy providing support for ExpeditedSSL, that support has become a huge driver of word-or-mouth referrals and has driven any number of big user experience improvements.<p>WHY DELIVER GREAT SUPPORT\nBeyond, just trying to keep your customers sort of generically happy, there&#x27;s two really important reasons to try and nail support:<p>1. Support Effort is Weighted to New/Trial Users<p>To get a new user of your software you have to attract visitors, teach them what you do, maybe email them a few times and then after they signup and you&#x27;ve expended all of that effort and expense it&#x27;s crazy to throw away an opportunity to keep them.<p>Early user support is incredibly lucrative as it&#x27;s the difference between keeping a trial customer and them leaving. A 5 minute email to a new user that keeps them around for a year of service can easily earn you hundreds of dollars.<p>2. Good Support Is How You Get Fans<p>With rare exception, people seem to get more upset over support issues (unresponsiveness) than from actual issues.<p>Most places are so bad at support that if you&#x27;re able to respond quickly, fix their problems and in general not act like some stiff support robot you&#x27;ll make people really happy and huge fans.<p>This effect is so pronounced that I almost wish we could have some minor issue occur in the onboarding process that we could reach out to people about.<p>This is an area where you as a startup actually have a profound advantage over larger companies as you&#x27;re likely much more knowledgeable about your product and definitely more invested in a user having a good experience than some random for-hire support person at BigCo.<p>WHAT TO SUPPORT\nIt&#x27;s easy to lump all post sale activity for a customer into &#x27;support&#x27;, but splitting it out into a few broad categories helps address the underlying issues in each.<p>Technical Support<p>This is what most people consider &quot;support&quot;. A user reaches out with an error and after some troubleshooting you tell them how to fix it.<p>Onboarding/Usage<p>Not necessarily that there is an error, but perhaps they don&#x27;t know what to do next or need assistance in getting their data loaded or preferences setup.<p>Customer Service<p>Typically billing, renewals and anything else regarding the service outside the core functionality.<p>HOW TO DO SUPPORT<p>EMAIL<p>Your primary means of supporting users is likely to be email. It&#x27;s asynchronous but lets you respond quickly and starting out will likely be sufficiently organized to keep things moving without a full blown helpdesk application.<p>Secondly, it lets you be extremely precise and copy & paste friendly in a way that phone calls can&#x27;t match. Ex: we often have to help people set their DNS entries and it&#x27;s much easier to email someone the following than explain it.<p>Please set your www CNAME to fugu-2034.herokussl.com<p>Email is in fact so predominant as a support tool that you can actually go quite far with managing support requests in your email client before you need a dedicated support app/service. Modern email clients that nicely group emails into threads are more than adequate to get started.<p>A few months after starting I switched from a dedicated Gmail account to Fastmail and it made a profound difference as just receiving and responding to emails was faster by about 10 minutes on each side.<p>SKYPE & PHONE<p>We primarily use Skype and Phone calls as an escalation method. If someone is really turned around conceptually as to what needs to happen to get things working; often a short phone call can put things straight.<p>I&#x27;m also always on the lookout for users phone numbers in their email signatures. I&#x27;ll sometimes just call them back if they email in with a question or problem as this is such a huge inversion of their expectations (being left on hold with instrumental covers of ABBA tunes playing and a disembodied voice that talks about &quot;call volumes&quot; and how you&#x27;re &quot;very important to us&quot;) - that they&#x27;ll hopefully feel really positive about the experience.<p>CHAT<p>I had really high hopes for chat, and had tried using Olark for several months, but whatever combination of user experience and expectation that came through, just did not get any takers.<p>I&#x27;d really like to offer real-time chat as a support channel and may try it again in the coming year.<p>TWITTER<p>Some developers still look askance at Twitter &quot;If I&#x27;m building a business, why do I need to know what people had for lunch. Har Har.&quot; - but it is undeniably a support channel as people now have an expectation of being able to say: &quot;Hey COMPANY_NAME - I&#x27;m having trouble&quot; and get a response.<p>Further, while all the other support mechanisms are at least within your control (aka you&#x27;re not going to get support phone calls if you don&#x27;t have a support number) - Twitter is most definitely not. People will tweet about your product or service and the issues they have with it at the drop of a hat.<p>To help these people you need to monitor Twitter, I setup a custom column within TweetDeck that searches for ExpeditedSSL and &quot;Heroku SSL&quot;. Which makes this a breeze.<p>WHAT TO SAY\nWhatever the support channel that a request comes in from, I try to incorporate the following elements of what I&#x27;ve found makes a great support experience:<p>1. Apologize for them having had to waste their time: &quot;Sorry you have to deal with this hassle&quot;<p>2. From the context make sure that they know it&#x27;s a knowledgable live human that is invested in fixing their issue; not a NLP auto-responder script, not an intern with a list of set support responses.<p>The easiest thing to do is just look at their email address or signature for their name and put that in your salutation.<p>3. Explain what they need to do in the exact way that they need to, this means that I&#x27;m not cutting and referencing things like &quot;set the dns cname to example.com&quot; - but actually put their domains, names, servers, etc. into the instructions.<p>4. Try to explain what caused the issues. We sometimes have issues with our upstream cert providers, sometimes weird things happen with the Heroku API, once I forgot to buy more credits (I have to purchase certs ahead of time). I just try to be really honest about what happened.<p>5. Sympathize - we&#x27;re really lucky that all of our customers are genuinely competent developers. But they don&#x27;t typically do DNS work or other config tasks - so they feel bad about not knowing what to do.<p>6. Anticipate - beyond just fixing their current issue, point them to the next step that they need to accomplish.<p>MAKING A SUPPORTABLE SERVICE\nSome of the highest ROI time I&#x27;ve spent on ExpeditedSSL was in user experience reviews. I&#x27;d ask a friend out to coffee (or random people on Twitter to join me on Skype) and just ask them to try and get through a SSL Install. I&#x27;d watch their progress and flich and be incredibly embarrassed as they got stuck on seemingly &quot;obvious&quot; steps.<p>Some of the companies I&#x27;ve worked for have spent tens of thousands of dollars on doing customer feedback and user review studies.<p>So with that in mind, it&#x27;s quite reasonable to consider every support case as a free, mini lesson on UX that a real actual user has sent you. As a direct consequence of support cases we&#x27;ve:<p>- Added a &quot;Test Email&quot; button the the approver addresses<p>- Automatically force the best option for &#x27;www&#x27; vs naked domain names<p>- Improved the DNS checking to say both what should and what should NOT be done with DNS<p>- Added post install instructions for configuring the most popular app-stacks for forced ssl.<p>Together this forms a feedback loop, where as you improve the product you get fewer and fewer support issues that you can then proportionally handle better and better. To help encourage users to give feedback I always put my title as &#x27;Developer Support&#x27; so that they can feel more free to complain to me about product issues than if I had my CEO or Founder hat on.",1448857915

If you allow threads to transiently access objects between &quot;sync points&quot; this won&#x27;t even be all that inefficient, as you will only be using it to track sub-graph roots as you make calls to other functions... for various reasons many of the more legit mechanisms have that same limitation anyway (where threads are only stopped to be scanned at moments they mark as safe).

The actual problem is still pretty simple.<p>[for those dropping into this thread without having followed the link, we seem to have restricted our discussion to the (x, 2x) problem, which is mentioned in the plover.com article but is not where it starts]<p>Probability is a means of dealing with uncertainty.  When you open the envelope you were handed and see $10, what you&#x27;ve learned is that the other envelope contains either $5 or $20.  This is not postulating existence of both of those envelopes - this is your uncertainty about which world you inhabit, one with two envelopes ($5, $10) or one with two envelopes ($10, $20).  It&#x27;s true that you only inhabit one of those worlds, but you don&#x27;t know which and probability is how you get a handle on your lack of knowledge.<p>As I understand it, the problem is that a natural - but errant! - next step is to say, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how likely it is that the envelopes were stuffed with $5 and $10 vs $10 and $20, so I&#x27;m going to assume both are equally likely.&quot;  Around $10, this is probably a good approximation.  But if you&#x27;re saying this <i>before looking at the envelopes</i>, then it amounts to saying &quot;the probabilities are equal for any choice of value&quot; (for all x, P(x)=P(2x)).  I&#x27;m actually not sure what distribution should be chosen to reflect zero knowledge of a rational number, but it should be <i>a distribution</i> - the likelihood of all possible outcomes should sum to certainty (1).  That is incompatible with &quot;for all x, P(x)=P(2x)&quot;.",1448856494

Fair enough, but frankly that means nothing. They could be using AES, or RSA, or pretty much any good algorithm and I still wouldn't care. Two reasons: their implementation might be rubbish and enable attacks or their cryptography might be irrelevant because another technique (traffic analysis?) might make breaking Haystack possible. After all, all the Iranian government needs is a list of people running the software.</i><p>In this specific case, having the source open would permit cryptography researchers (of sufficient skill and aptitude) to analyze whether or not Haystack is actually doing what it needs to do.  Put another way: how do we know that Haystack isn't including a back door to capture all the information passing through their system, to sell on to the Iranian government for a hefty fee?  We don't.<p>I'm not arguing that open source is inherently more secure than closed source; I'm just saying that in some specific cases, there are clear benefits to having the source available for inspection.",1281358354

If you ask me, a bunch of pressure hulls put together in one outer hull is a lot more complicated than a single pressure hulls. That can only be cheaper/simplier becasue the cost of labor is so much lower. Welding the pressure hull is extremely expensive.<p>If you look at reliability, all 18 of the US Ohio class which were design/built starting in the 70s (while the Typhoon came out in the 80s) are still in operation and are slated to be replace in about 2020. None have had a catastrophic accident. They've had something like 130 succesful Trident practice launches in a row.

It is probably true that eventually we will know if Haystack is effective or not.

1587728,story,,,2,1,wizard_2,"Ask HN:(Review my startup) MacSupport.com is there for you. I'm there for you.",,"People call me all the time. I haven't worked as a consultant in years, yet I still hear from old clients regularly. I started my business by going to people's homes and businesses. I would introduce myself, learn about them, and learn about their problem. Then I'd fix it. I'd show them exactly how I solved their problem so they could, if inclined, fix it themselves if it ever came up in the future. At the very least, they'd have the knowledge to explain it to another tech. I was there for them, so they always called me back when they needed more help.<p>Building my network of clients took effort. I had to get work by pitching. Telling stories. I'd tell stories about other clients, I'd tell stories about myself. I'd tell stories about the future, about how technology I was excited about could be useful to them, and where they could be with help. Any help, not just me. I may have named my business ""Wizard,"" but I don't know any magic. I'm just good at what I do, and so they called me.<p>I got involved with a startup, MacSupport.com. MacSupport is there for you in ways I could never be as a consultant. We have techs waiting for you to call. We answer when you email us and we're there for you on the phone. While we can't travel and come to your house, we're instantly beside you, in your computer, showing you how we're doing what we do.<p>Our techs are smart and friendly and our customers love us. I'd like to consider that a success. Our problem is, I don't know how to pitch on the internet. I don't know how to find enough customers. And since we're not meeting out clients I don't know how to go the extra mile that gets them referring us to their friends. A handshake and a smile made a lot of a difference.<p>I'm trying a few ideas:<p>1) We haven't been talking to our current customers enough. We sent them one email on purchase and one in the beginning. When we have them on the phone we play our part well, keep them clam, and teach them enough so they're not more worried about their situation than we are. They almost always hang up happy. We're supposed to follow-up in the end, but we haven't been (miscommunication with the techs). I would like to be better at that.<p>2) We're too expensive for the small quick questions. I want to have a free email support option. One or two questions a month free, you can subscribe to a package for more, or you can refer friends for more. (think dropbox)<p>3) Improve the site's UX. I can talk about this one more later, we should have screenshots in the next few days.<p>4) Better email capabilities. I want to be able to say ""Just email us at support@macsupport.com"" and have our backend system work the way it should, creating account, adding messages to tickets, etc. (Just call, or IM us should work the same way too.)<p>5) Marketing. We need to figure out how to get more referrers and conversions. We've tried traditional press releases, and we constantly tweak our Google adwords. We got nowhere with the press, and the business we do have is from months of continually refining our adwords campaign. I feel like we're missing something, but I don't know what.<p>This is a ""review my startup"". I think these are our core problems, but our solutions fall short. I'd like to know what you think.<p>Thank you for your time.<p>---\nFrancis Gulotta\nDirector of Technology\nMacSupport.com",1281356159

To me, that means that you are probably not a Linux or Mac or Windows user because they all can crash and lose your data. Likewise you are not a user of any office suite because you've likely to lose data from all of them. Likewise, even ISPs can disconnect you half-way through a transaction (say buying something or editing a blog post) and so you will stop using them because of that.<p>So good luck with historious.

Most people in Cambridge don't live near the city centre, because it's an old city and much of the space is taken by either the university or business premises. There are, however, many residential areas on the outskirts, and a whole string of surrounding villages.<p>Plenty of tech companies have set up in the middle of Cambridge, but with the transport policies of the local authorities, car access and parking is absurdly difficult. That makes it awkward to host visitors if you need to, and it is a genuine recruitment issue in that not everyone is willing to walk, cycle, or rely on our less than stellar local bus service for routine commutes to work from the surrounding area. Setting up on one of the business parks -- which are still within cycling distance of the city centre for keen cyclists based there, but also easy to access by car and usually by bus as well -- seems to have all of the advantages of being in Cambridge, without the unnecessary travel limitations.",1281355704

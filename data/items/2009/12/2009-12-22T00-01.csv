Why not let the browser store and parse the CSS? That's what it is designed to do. And when the browser stores a CSS rule, it can optimise it much more than it can optimise a generic JavaScript literal.<p>IMHO, this is educational, but useless. CSS already does the job better and by separating your CSS files you could squeeze all the performance you need.<p>Of course if you can demonstrate how this could possibly be fast on modern browsers on a page with 1,000,000 CSS classes I would be very impressed.<p>Last: note on terminology.

We'll have to wait until the introduction of Ford's second-gen SYNC system sometime next year.<p>No, the worst part is the fact that you need to buy <i>a new car</i> to get a clean solution to wireless.<p>I recently bought a car with built-in bluetooth and satellite nav; it's my first car with any serious user-computer interaction. I bought the car used, built in '06. What I realized is that what I really want is for the satellite nav screen to be a secondary output for my iphone. I don't want their nav, I want to just run google maps. I don't want to sync my phone contacts list into the car's phone contacts. AFAIK, there is no way to send an address from my iphone to the nav system, and the nav UI is terrible.<p>When new cars cost two orders of magnitude more than new phones, there really needs to be a better interface. There's no justification to buying a car because it has an ipod dock or whatever the next big thing is. The computer screen in the car should be an open API for the iphone to plug into, and the iphone should have an open API for controlling external monitors and input devices (once the hardware supports it). For me, this is the solution to pg's ""iphone as a development platform"".<p>Of course, the car manufacturers will have none of it.

The Bootstrap curriculum doesn't look anything what you describe. The students start off writing simple expressions and then move on to writing some core functions in a 2D side-scrolling video game. It's not only an introduction to programming, but also a concrete application of algebra to a problem that many kids are passionate about -- making a video game. For most, or maybe all, of the students in my Oakland class (6th- and 7th-graders), it was their first encounter with variables, functions and abstract thinking, e.g., accomplishing animation by performing math operations on variables representing idealized x/y coordinates.<p>There were attendance problems in Oakland due mainly to external factors, like parents not wanting their kids walking home after dark. Only 7 of the original 13 Oakland students finished the class, compared to 12 out of 14 in Daly City, but everyone who finished the class in both Oakland and Daly City had a working program by the end of the 10-week course. I think it's fair to say that all of the students who finished have a reasonably good understanding of some basic computer science concepts: functions, variables, applying operators to values, evaluating expressions, and a simple notion of types (strings, numbers, booleans and ""images""). The obvious next steps would be iteration/recursion and some simple compound data structures, but we didn't have time for that in just 10 lessons, which is all that this particular after-school program permitted.<p>My point is this: middle school students can handle a fairly rigorous approach to introductory computer science. Saying we shouldn't teach something because it will be taught poorly is no excuse not to teach it the right way -- we just need people qualified to do that. That's the real problem, but most of you who're reading this could help do something about that by volunteering to teach a curriculum like Bootstrap.",1261441205

Are you talking about dynamically including them client or server-side?<p>This site looks rather bland considering that it is promoting a stylesheet framework.

        body {background-color:#000000; color:#FFFFFF; margin:20px;}
        a { color:#FFFFFF;}
        a:hover { color:#CCCCCC;}	
    </style>
</code></pre>
I guess this goes hand-in-hand with the grammar, which is also lacking.<p>Now lets take a look at the sample styling code:<p><pre><code>    drip.toolbar.css = {
	  height : ""40px"", 
	  width : ""89px"", 
	  position :""fixed"", 
	  right : 50, 
	  bottom : 0,
	  overflow : ""hidden"",
	  cursor : ""pointer"",
	  color : ""#FEFEFE"",
	  ""background-color"": ""#932c2c"",
	  ""text-align"" : ""left"",
	  ""font-family"" : ""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"",
	  ""font-size"" : ""12px"",

	  ""#drip-toolbar-button"" : {
		height : ""30px"",
		width : ""50px"",
		cursor : ""pointer"",
	  },
	  
	  "".links"" : {
		  color : ""#FEFEFE""
	  }
</code></pre>
This is different / an improvement on CSS how?  You are adding extra characters (double quotes and colon) compared to plain-old css for a more bloated stylesheet that must be downloaded?  That might be considered nit-picky, but the benefit here of using JSSS is not obvious (Im still trying to figure it out).<p>Also, the 4 line example is actually 6:<p><pre><code>    function parseCSS(id,css){
	  for(style in css){
		if(typeof css[style] == 'object'){parseCSS(style,css[style]);
		else{$(id).css(style,css[style]);}
	  }
	};
</code></pre>
Comments have already been made about having javascript disabled.  Perhaps a <noscript> tag that would pull down REAL CSS (again, what is the point of this?  I am now maintaining CSS and JSSS?) would remedy.",1261440304

We contribute to their survival and spread by continually re-planting them -- corn, for example, is arguably the king of this kind of adaptation. For more on this, I highly recommend Michael Pollan's ""Botany of Desire"" or, for a shorter version, his TED talk on the same subject.",1261440167

But he just said ""bad thing to start, bad thing to encourage.""<p>Here, let's try a thought exercise.  ""I got hit on by this guy at a bar the other night.  Let's make it public that he's gay and obviously scum ('cause he hit on me).  I'll give $100 for whoever can tell me his name and where to go to tell his neighbors, $50 for the person who told them, and $25 for each of the next people to tell them.""<p>See why it might be a bad idea to encourage this as a general solution to this type of problem?<p>Don't get me wrong -- it really sucks that Threadless got robbed, and these guys (assuming they were the thieves) deserve to be found and punished.<p>But as we discover new means of vigilante justice, it's worth remembering that vigilante justice has a cost in fairness, accuracy and rule of law.",1261440070

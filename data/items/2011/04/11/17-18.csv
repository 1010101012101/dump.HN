If you put in a sell order with a minimum price of something like $0.60, the orders would go through immediately, and you'd get $5600 in your Mt. Gox account. Once again, you've failed to actually fact check your post. The daily volume of Mt. Gox is routinely 10,000-15,000. Yes, you would bring the price down about $0.10 in a matter of minutes and possibly trigger a sell off, but that wouldn't make a difference to you if you just wanted your $5600.<p>EDIT:\nHere's the actual spreadsheet if you'd like to double check my work: <a href=""https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AomGTgVWFh3WdDAxQ01EZVZkZ0ZhdnpieFhRWVlYU1E&hl=en&authkey=CIqqzLUC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AomGTgVWFh3WdDAxQ01...</a><p>Here's where I got the data on mygox: <a href=""http://mtgox.com/trade/history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mtgox.com/trade/history</a>",1302544722

I have no problem believing this is due to security concerns, and I applaud them for making the move. Blindly running plugins that have a history like QT is very poor behavior. Hopefully they will be flagging oracle java for similar treatment soon.<p>To be clear, you simply have to manually enable QT for a domain you want it to run.

Capitalist society always allocates most of the reward to those who take the monetary risk, not those who do the work.</i><p>This assumes that having a paying job at all is not itself much of a reward, and that the programmer's take-home pay constitutes no profit for the programmer. But this is wrong, because the programmer would rather have the money than his free time, so the transaction is highly profitable <i>to him</i>. (It's also invalid to suppose that the main human motivation is only to make so many dollars while ignoring all the other relevant context.) Who is it that said ""the maintenance of life and the pursuit of happiness are not separate issues?""<p>Another problem with your way of looking at it is that it ignores non-financial rewards. Doing a <i>good job</i> causes an increase in self-esteem (the real kind that results in the creation of value, not the fake thing we call by the same name, where your teacher gives you and everyone else a gold star), and <i>that</i> is a reward. No one else can ever give you genuine self-esteem.<p>It doesn't bother me that there are other people out there with a great deal of money, while I don't have very much at the moment. All I care about is myself, and how I'm going to make the most of <i>my</i> life.

If and when I earn lots of money by creating and trading value voluntarily with other people, I'll be able to <i>keep what I've earned</i> by the same principle enjoyed by others who have earned their wealth, and that's good for my flourishing life.""",1302544494

It's a formal modeling of lobbying and interest groups.  The incentive structure is such that small groups capable of action can easily push for their specific interests, exceptions, loopholes, and other private goods.  Whereas, the general public, which in general would prefer simplified and rationalized laws that treat everyone equally, has a hard time mobilizing to protect their interests because of their size and diffuse character.<p>Wikipedia summarizes the core of the argument:<p><i>The idea is that small distributional coalitions tend to form over time in countries. Groups like cotton-farmers, steel-producers, and labor unions will have the incentives to form lobby groups and influence policies in their favor. These policies will tend to be protectionist and anti-technology, and will therefore hurt economic growth; but since the benefits of these policies are selective incentives concentrated amongst the few coalitions members, while the costs are diffused throughout the whole population, the ""Logic"" dictates that there will be little public resistance to them. Hence as time goes on, and these distributional coalitions accumulate in greater and greater numbers, the nation burdened by them will fall into economic decline.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancur_Olson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancur_Olson</a><p>So, the idea is a kind of 'death by a thousand cuts' where each little loophole or exemption is not so large that the public will rally against it, but the cumulative effect of interest groups ends up creating a byzantine system of laws which become unintelligible and hold back growth.<p>Politicians, while running under the banner of broad ideologies, know that their practical support comes from smaller groups capable of mobilization (whether it's financial contributions or unions getting out the vote).

That's nearly $200,000 before taxes, and represents an hourly rate of about $150 to $200 per hour (there's a fair amount of of downtime for freelancers and consultants).<p>You won't make $200 per hour selling your services as a developer to SMEs and startups (the typical market for freelance developers). That kind of money is usually reserved for solving significant problems for big businesses.<p>On the other hand, can make an equivalent amount at a lower rate by starting starting your own development agency and hiring other developers ... and sales people ... and administrative staff. But that means you're not really out on your own, and your value is in successfully managing people -- not being a ""smart hacker working very hard.""<p>The other way to make a significant amount of money is to build a product that people love. This isn't an easy task. I'd venture that a significant number of people on HN have actually tried building their own products.<p>There's a very good reason why hard working and smart software developers aren't making $3 million each year -- it's because it's extremely hard to do, requires a skill set that is far broader than simply writing good code, and also involves a lot of luck (being the right person, at the right time, in the right place). We happen to have a skill that is in demand and pays well, but that does not make us brilliant business people.<p>All that aside: working for yourself can be an extremely rewarding experience in and of itself, and over time you will make a good amount of money as you hone your craft and business skills. I love what I do, and I strongly encourage others to try it out if they're interested in the independent work- and lifestyle.<p>tl;dr? Independent, smart, hard working hackers can make good money, but the $3M / year figure is bullshit.",1302543835

He begins:<p><i>There is an interesting kernel here, but it's less about Apple's focus on clean aesthetics than about the seamless interoperability and user-friendliness of the entire Apple product line; clean aesthetics are just one part of that.</i><p>But modern architecture and designs' famous slogans are ""form follows function"" and ""less is more.""  Following that, Steve Jobs has said:<p><i>People think it's this veneer  that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</i><p>So the opening dichotomy set up by the Economist writer is slightly misleading, as if he's revealing something about Apple and design that wasn't already implicit in their aesthetic lineage and public statements.<p>The point you're highlighting, which I think is relevant, the authors sums up:<p><i>In many areashealth reform, financial reform, urban-planning reform, and moreefforts to make life more user-friendly for citizens are targeted by both libertarians and by vested commercial interests as vaguely fascistic efforts to centralise control or limit freedom.</i><p>Again, the effort to rationalize complex systems doesn't really have a political valence in the way he's set it upit's not libertarian or corporatist or fascist.<p>For example, libertarians often argue for the elimination of byzantine statutory systems and requirements.  They argue for tax simplification, the repeal of complex or unused laws that remain on the books or that are open for arbitrary application, and in general argue against prior restraint or over-broad criminalization of behavior.  To wit, Ayn Rand:<p><i>There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.</i><p>The rationalizing effort also extends to fascist regimes that rethought urban architecture (e.g. Speer), and 'made the trains run on time,' and inserted the state into the middle of capital-labor relations in order to achieve social harmony.  It extends to socialist countries that simplify consumer choice by restricting market entry and simplify provision of welfare by providing uniform national systems with guarantees and remove volatility from the economy by socializing investment.  It extends to the arguments of classical liberals who sought to rationalize the whole system of society to sweep away arbitrary powers and customary rights, and reorganize spaces and cities (whether Hausmann redesigning Paris or Henry Ford rationalizing production or Fredrick Winslow Taylor rationalizing management).<p>The effort to rationalize and simplify crosses almost all Enlightenment era or modern political ideologies.  The only difference is the focus of the rationalization effort.",1302542278

I think for this type of work Adobe Fireworks has a lot of the right tools.  There are vector tools that are really useful for building ui elements (rectangles with rounded corners, triangles, etc.).  Then there are effects that can be applied to layers like stroke (line around the edge), drop shadow, glow etc.  Fireworks also has a pretty decent way of organizing your work using a hierarchy of ""folders"" that can contain different pieces of the image.  It sort of falls somewhere between Photoshop and Illustrator and at least in concept is a great tool for building ui mock-ups and actual ui elements.<p>Fireworks does seem expensive, but my main complaint is how bloated it is.  There are tons of tools I don't need and some operations take longer than you would think they should.  For example on the OS X version of Fireworks, clicking the close file button makes the whole app lockup for about a second while it tries to bring up the dialog to ask if you want to save or not. Not a huge deal on it's own<p>Basically I would love to see a tool that competes with Fireworks for the ui design.  Preferably it would be a bit cheaper, but I am much more concerned that it has a more targeted feature set and doesn't feel sluggish while using it.",1302541751

I'm not super familiar with Python, but I believe it is dynamically (that is to say, singleton) typed.  This might not correspond exactly to Python, but let's assume there is an any type, product types (for forming tuples in function arguments) corresponding logically to conjunction and function types corresponding logically to implication.  Any well-formed expression (e.g. 0) has any type, so any is true as a proposition.  Thus, all types are inhabited and all propositions are true.  By proof irrelevence, the logical content of any Python program is equal to the constant function 0.  In other words, they have no proof content. Thus, I claim the students here are not doing math via programming in the techincal sense of C-H.<p>I stand by my original claim that they are not doing math by programming in a looser sense, either.  I studied computer science, spent a dozen years working as a programmer and now I'm studying math in graduate school.<p>> I think programming is much closer to math than this comment gives it credit for.<p>I might have said something like this before I started doing serious math.<p>You make a mistake by thinking that programming and math are the same, except that programs get ""checked"" by computer.  That's like claiming that video games are more physically demanding than sports because the rules are enforced perfectly.<p>Math is about understanding why something is true.  A program that uses or applies a mathematical idea rarely (never?) contains a proof of that idea's correctness.  For a mathematician, testing is insufficient evidence for truth.  Proofs are universal and they generally apply to an infinite number of cases.  There is a deep qualitative difference between conceptually understanding why something is true and checking a finite number of cases, or even implementing a procedure to check those cases.  You can try to belittle mathematical methods by calling them hand waving or imprecise, but programmers are not even trying to do what they do.",1302541744

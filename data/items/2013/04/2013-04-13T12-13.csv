I'm sorry but search results are not a meritocracy and to think otherwise is just plain foolish.<p>First of all, if results can be hand ordered is it a meritocracy? No. Because it's a select individuals opinion. Can their opinion be bought? Yep.<p>Second, can you buy popularity? Yep. Then is it a meritocracy? Nope. If EA or Zynga puts out a game and spends $10 million promoting it and uses their other apps to make it popular, is that a meritocracy when it shows up at the top of a search result? No. It isn't.<p>Search engines aren't a meritocracy. The best results don't win. The most relevant thing isn't always given. They are an attempt to return relevant information, but how that relevance is determined is not necessarily merit related at all. It just has to solve the user problem. It can be done in any order that the search engine provider deems fit.<p>For example, Google shows ads alongside the search results. The top ads aren't merit related. They are profit related. Google puts paid results above real results. Google puts money above relevance.<p>When you are talking about millions of dollars being thrown around, it is no longer about merit, it's about influence and those are not the same thing.",1365857173

However, trying to put myself in your shoes, in whatever manner possible, I can think of a few things:<p>a. Get in touch with people with similar problems and learn from their experiences.<p>As I read this, I remembered the story I read not too long ago:<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/mayank-sharma-amnesia-facebook_n_1772944.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/mayank-sharma-amnes...</a><p><a href=""http://www.facebookstories.com/stories/32/mayank-sharma-his-illness-and-recovery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebookstories.com/stories/32/mayank-sharma-his-...</a><p>..and his blog:<p><a href=""http://opensourcebrain.geekybodhi.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensourcebrain.geekybodhi.net/</a><p>Now, although the situation is not quite the same, only slightly similar (in terms of loss of memory), it serves as an example. Social networks work excellent as a support group in situations such as these. Not only does it help to learn from people out there who are dealing with the same issue, but also technically speaking -- reusing existing resources is the most optimal and efficient way to (re)build something - be it software or one's life :)<p>b. Decide on a longer term objective first. A couple of examples:<p>* You probably are in an unique position to think about how to use technology to help people who are affected by the problems you are facing. Does that appeal to you ? If it does, can you think of a way to use technology as a means to build a platform/app/resource ...etc ?<p>* If not that, try to answer, what would you like to do ? What, in your definition is a 'software developer' -- do you want to get back to exactly what you were doing earlier ? Or do you want to explore technologies that you probably never worked on before ? ...and why ?<p>c. When you've got a rough idea of a longer term objective, you shall hopefully know what are the short-to-mid term goals you'd have to achieve in terms of the necessary skills. Write them out. Prioritize and then get cracking.<p>I know it is easy for me to say it and although I don't suffer from amnesia, every once in a while I try to 'brush up' skills that I don't use in my daily work (read: C :) ) and I suspect that I do. So, I share (at least) a bit of your frustration -- exactly as you said -- ""Ill probably be rolling my eyes at how simple some things are but also getting stuck on relatively basic things
until they click again.""<p>...though, I do not think there is another way to approach (re)learning.<p>d. Do you have access to any of your own code ? ie: code you have written from scratch yourself (as opposed to collaborated on). I would imagine re-reading/re-implementing bits of that might help. I say this because, experience has led me to believe that every programmer has a very individual 'coding style'. Much like prose, coders tend to express themselves in a manner that can be identified as their writing. From choice of variable names, to control flow. Relearning the technologies you knew might be easier if you did it with your own code.<p>e. Understand that university education will only help you gain a certain level of self-confidence in your abilities. To actually learn anything, you have to 'do'. So github might serve you better than coursera.<p>f. As far as employment is concerned, that is a different question than the 're-learning' process -- others have suggested options and I do not have any opinion to offer there except that putting your code out there (eg: on github) as well as progress (eg: a blog) might help.<p>wish you the very best

""Hire slowly"": while Github was small for the first 2.5 years, the second 2.5 years have had insane growth.<p>I don't think Github has been around long enough to see if they can really retain people. They've gotten a lot of people in the last year because of money and because the work is good, to be sure. Someone else great will come along eventually, and the real test of Github's retention will happen when those people have a new offer.<p>As a purely technical company, Github has a lot of advantages to offer to technical people. I'm not slagging on them: personally, I'd love to work there. I just think they haven't been through a real test of retention yet.",1365855168

Yahoo could buy both DDG and Blekko, and if Yahoo as a company and culture manages to turn around, that resulting search engine could become even more popular than Bing.<p>Yahoo search engine is only a few points behind Bing right now anyway (at least in US), and those were lost because they partnered with Bing in the first place, and those people decided that they might as well use Bing, the source, now.<p>Bing's market share grew mainly because they managed to partner or capture most other niche search engines out there (by getting them to use the Bing API). It didn't take anything away from Google, nor did it replace others on its own. It's actually other engines like Yandex and Baidu that are growing faster than Bing.",1365855164

They don't wake much because they sleep more than adults, and if they wake they're easily nursed so remain calm. It's the modern Western practice of separating babies from parents at night, and sometimes not nursing, that results in what you describe. Additionally, colick, the name we give to some infant's tendency to cry excessively, is often related to disagreeable food eaten by the mother, something more likely to happen in a sophisticated society that eats a wider variety of food.<p>Also, if babies naturally are biphasic sleepers (not saying they are not, just that they're not naturally as disruptive as modern practices make them), that supports humans being naturally biphasic but suppressing it through habits and environments.",1365854645

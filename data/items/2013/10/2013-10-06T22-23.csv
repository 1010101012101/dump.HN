Smart digital technology makes this cheap and easy. Sure, having the camera out all the time is compulsive. Going through and manually editing, tagging and deleting photos is compulsive too. Most people do neither, but they still want to keep their photo memories safe.",1381100394

I generally believe you should stay in school, and more importantly stay learning technical stuff (whether undergrad, grad school or in a technically challenging job). It&#x27;s the best way to get ideas, and more importantly find people to work with (if you want to start a company). So I do harbor doubts about the Thiel Fellowship (though I happen to know quite a few talented kids in the program, and think it&#x27;s working well for most of them).<p>However, you will <i>not</i> learn how to be a Founder/CEO without being a Founder/CEO. Some have a natural ability at this, but 99% of even the best CEOs probably just have the ability to learn quickly on their feet. By the time their mistakes might be noticed, they&#x27;ve already learned and corrected them.<p>The only thing you&#x27;ll learn by working your way up the corporate ladder is how to work your way up the corporate ladder. The stuff about learning <i>how to work hard</i> is BS. If you want to do a startup and hope things will happen for you, you probably believe in an all-powerful being that has a plan for you.",1381100206

Link rot is what defines the web. Very few people grok the concept of &quot;evergreen domains&quot;, and &quot;citable resources&quot;.<p>A domain must be kept renewed for, at least, ten years for it to be evergreen, and content must be citable if you want to go down in history for your efforts. How we go about implementing citable resources is tricky.<p>Unless you are a Zen Warrior and quite enjoy Sand Mandalas, then you shouldn&#x27;t be reading this. This article is for those that want to be found on the web for their work in the foreseeable future, and for those who don&#x27;t want their work attributed to other people. You want authorship of your resource to be correct.<p>Nobody ever really owns a domain. Much like land, it trades hands with numerous parties before it belongs to any one person; in which case that person can then sell it off and buy new land. Everything is borrowed. You own nothing, really. Imagine these scenarios:<p>- Domain expires for financial reasons; content can not be found.<p>- Webmaster dies; so he/she can&#x27;t renew it indefinitely.<p>- Your content is simply sold because you got greedy, and you don&#x27;t have authorship anymore.<p>- Domain stays up for 20 years, but the TCP/IP stack is rewritten, and Meshnets now dominate. You fade into darkness. (You are no longer discoverable).<p>- URLs point to the correct resource, but require proprietary software to view them. Only the intellectual elite can view the content.<p>- Cached copies exist, but only at the whim of Archivists who slurp the web using Historious / Pinboard / Archive.org / Google Cache / Reverse Proxies / Many Others... You can&#x27;t rely on these people / companies for keeping your content permanent.<p>And so I conclude that permalinking is a much deeper concept than a mere URL that points to a resource. It entails a slew of other topics that all center around the age old philosophy of permanence versus transience. It&#x27;s not just something bloggers use in Wordpress!",1381099888

6505746,comment,6505111,6505111,7,0,beloch,,,"Apple has experienced periods of decline before. In the mid to late nineties, before Jobs returned, Apple stuck to polishing OS9, which was simply too archaic to compete with Windows 95, NT, and subsequent MS OS&#x27;s of the nineties. They flip flopped on clones and ultimately maintained a losing status quo. This era also brought such blunders as the puck mouse, but towards the end Apple got a bit of a lift from the candy colored iMac. Still, had Apple not started branching out as they did, the dire predictions were probably true.<p>Is Apple in decline today? Their profits don&#x27;t appear to be. Today&#x27;s Apple also has a truly gargantuan nest-egg that could see the company through a protracted period of difficulty.

6505700,comment,6504878,6504878,3,0,eeadc,,,"The approach of Bedrock Linux is very interesting. It makes use of Linux-specific features like bind mounts and tries to unify several linux distributions into one meta-distribution, which gives the framework for the multi-distribution operations. They could also use namespaces for a more strict separation of clients, but that&#x27;s a detail.<p>The idea to move completely to musl is a little bit utopistic, because musl libc is in a very early phase if you want to compile any piece of software of the base system with it. It&#x27;s mostly C99/C11 and POSIX compilant, but there are several GNU-specific libraries missing, and in a world which uses GNU userland on Linux it&#x27;s not simple to overcome that limitation.<p>The mentioned /etc problem seems to be the same problem as solved by ip-netns(8). Take a look at the source if you need further information, it&#x27;s based on other bind mounts.<p>But I don&#x27;t think Bedrock Linux is the next-generation approach for Linux distributions, or rather software distributions in general, though they don&#x27;t claim that. I&#x27;m working on my own Linux distribution since about a year and it&#x27;s based completely on a ports tree, as known from FreeBSD, but with a simpler code base and simpler Makefiles. At the moment, I&#x27;m trying to create a stable commit, which will build without issues in several configurations, but that&#x27;s hard work, especially because Linux or rather the Linux userland is mostly a ghetto (you won&#x27;t get information about much low-level software).<p>But I think, as you should noticed, that Bedrock Linux has a right to exist, but it won&#x27;t be the next-generation approach.",1381098294

But as a practical matter, the market value of an underwater but performing loan is going to be significantly higher than the underlying asset, and most of the loans in the pool Richmond is looking at are performing.<p>A defaulted loan might be worth nothing more than the underlying asset less foreclosure costs (which can, as you note, be high); in some cases that might work out to be around 80% of the house value (which is what Richmond plans to offer), so in a small minority of cases Richmond&#x27;s plan may pass constitutional muster.  Unfortunately, their plan then relies on turning around and having the same home buyer get a new mortgage.  I&#x27;ll give you three guesses as to how easily a guy who just defaulted on his last mortgage will get a new one on the same house...<p>In short, yes, valuing mortgages is complicated.  But they are liquid, traded investments, and the market price is simply higher than Richmond is offering on average.  And the minority where it isn&#x27;t won&#x27;t work on its own.",1381097510

Your analysis that those not showing some minimal level of empathy are mean spirited and stupid sounds more or less correct to me although its a matter of degree which makes it messily analog and complicated.<p>As for commentary about lost memories and such, in the long run we&#x27;re all lost.  Live your life to live, not to be documented and preserved.  You&#x27;re a person not a wikipedia article.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d like most eastern philosophical outlooks on life; but we don&#x27;t have to all agree with each other, merely be civil enough in our near direct opposition.  Historically humans have done worse.<p>I would disagree with the ignorant, useless commentary in that most people know (of) someone with a hoarding problem and here on HN we know all about complicated technical rituals.  As for the useless thats hard to parse, there seems little point in referencing a hoarding support URL in a locale where we all pretty much know how to google.  And people who are sick usually already know so mentioning it isn&#x27;t helping, as you correctly mention.<p>Overall a mixed bag, 7.0/10.0 as a comment about half the wide ranging comments were good and/or half good, some not so good.  Well written from a literary standpoint although some logical argument issues behind the first glance.<p>On a broader scale I think its interesting to consider hoarding in the digital age; not seen much on that.  Most of the diagnostic criteria from meatspace should transition pretty smoothly into tech; is the behavior negatively impacting the victim, and so on.<p>I don&#x27;t think the cure for digital hoarding will be bigger storage or more outlandish technical schemes; I suspect a lot of people agree with me; this is probably the root of the &quot;backlash&quot; rather than some inherent hatred of victims.  The dude in the article is doing the exact wrong thing to fix his fundamental problem with outlook on life, therefore intense backlash.

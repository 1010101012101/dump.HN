If they are large or were allocated over time (= from different memory blocks) fewer will be pulled in.  It seems to me that this would make prefetch less effective.

CHAR is only actually a fixed length if you actually ensure that it is so yourself. That&#x27;s possible but then you&#x27;re just using a CHAR as a placeholder for those semantics not as something that naturally enforces them.<p>If you actually really really have fixed length fields then yes CHARs could be appropriate. But for many things even though you intend for them to be static length codes things change when you start having to interoperate with systems designed with different constraints. (For example after mergers or aquiring a competitor.) And I know that mainframes still exist but they aren&#x27;t the use case in mind when many say &quot;USE CHAR&quot;.<p>Also the database adapter that handles CHAR poorly is none other than JDBC on oracle <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5332845/oracle-jdbc-and-oracle-char-data-type"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5332845/oracle-jdbc-and-o...</a>

And Bootstrap is great to quickly create &quot;pretty&quot; prototypes. But I&#x27;ve always found Foundation having better... foundations. I&#x27;ve used both on numerous projects and here&#x27;s my take :<p>* The grid system now looks like bootstrap, and I don&#x27;t like that. You have to choose the type of column you want to use (and I don&#x27;t want to be bothered by that). so no .six anymore, it&#x27;s .medium-6 or .large-6 or .small-6... They should call the .small-6 just .six so we know its the default one.<p>* It does look a bit better, although they removed styling of the radiobox in forms? Why?<p>* Overall I still prefer bootstrap&#x27;s theme, I wish Foundation would offer an optional theme like bootstrap 3 does.<p>* OffCanvas menu is great ! I can already see plenty of applications (but for mobile only)<p>* The CLI is a nice thing to have but I&#x27;m gonna stay away from it. I like the easiness of copypasting files to quickly begin a small project.<p>* Documentation is hard to go through, doesn&#x27;t allow to glance at what it offers. It&#x27;s a huge improvement from F4 or F3 though.<p>* I use sublime text snippets all the time and this might be a huge addition!<p>* I like the JS that verifies forms. I usually always use this on my projects so it&#x27;s nice to have it by default.<p>Overall I don&#x27;t really know if I should switch back to Foundation. But I&#x27;ll definitely use it for my next project to see how good it is.",1385063514

6776987,comment,6775330,6776606,6,0,hdevalence,,,"Versus Maple, there&#x27;s really no contest in my opinion, but that&#x27;s mostly related to the rather poor quality of Maple. I remember even five years ago, when Sage was considerably less mature, Sage was able to outperform Maple on first-year calculus problems (i.e., there were symbolic integrations that Maple choked on but Sage did perfectly). Sage is not only better than Maple at symbolics, but also at numerics, and the gap only widens as the mathematics level increases.<p>As an amusing anecdote, I had to use Maple for a course once, and compared the speed of a simple algorithm to find the order of an element of Z/nZ (by taking x, and adding it to itself in a loop until you get to 0). The Maple code ran approximately 100x slower than the Sage code, even though the Maple code used machine integers but Sage uses bigints by default.<p>With Mathematica, the general impression that I get is that for making interactive graphics, Mathematica is slightly better, but otherwise they&#x27;re mostly approximately even for the first-year case, with a slight edge to Mathematica. Sage&#x27;s friendly user interface is a web-based notebook, whereas Mathematica has a native application, but it&#x27;s pretty good. Sage has very good documentation for common use-cases, but I haven&#x27;t used the Sage notebook in a while, so I can&#x27;t really say how discoverable it is.<p>There are some resources on using Sage in an undergrad curriculum here, if you&#x27;re interested:<p><a href=""http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prep/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sagemath.org/doc/prep/index.html</a><p>though the examples presume you&#x27;re actually running a Sage notebook, so they don&#x27;t show what happens, for instance, when you add an @interact decorator to make an interactive thing, like so:<p><a href=""http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/</a><p>which has a nice example of an interactive Taylor-series approximation.",1385063469

Either way, if it&#x27;s suddenly being on new types of rocks, with new orientations of wells (horizontal), and in places it&#x27;s never been done before, and on a exponentially greater scale -- then it absolutely feels like <i>&quot;a new, experimental technique that hasnt been tested, isnt regulated, and is being tried for the first time in your backyard.&quot;</i><p>> <i>It is not a drilling technique... Hydraulic fracturing doesnt take place until well after the well has been drilled, cased, and cemented. It is a completion technique, to stimulate the production of the well. This is not splitting hairs, its a big difference; get the facts right</i><p>In the public&#x27;s mind it <i>is</i> splitting hairs. If the technology for fracking didn&#x27;t exist, there wouldn&#x27;t be all these new horizontal drilling rigs in people&#x27;s backyards. Of course there&#x27;s a technical distinction between the two which is important to the engineers who work in the field, but when a reporter or community complains about fracking they are complaining about the drilling, fracking, byproduct, and consequences that all arise when a well is created to take advantage of fracking.<p>> <i>We are not just pumping massive amounts of harmful chemicals into the earth. Fracturing fluid is generally made up of 98 percent water. The other 2 percent is chemicals ranging anywhere from acid to anti-bacterial agents (used in disinfectants), to gelling agents (used in ice cream), to friction reducers (used in cosmetics), to surfactants (used in laundry detergents).... We are pumping very small amounts of them thousands of feet below the surface and then recovering most of them when the well is flowed back.</i><p>First, if you introduce enough toxic chemicals into an aquifer to contaminate the water, no one cares whether those toxic chemicals were initially introduced as a 2% solution, 20% solution, or 0.02% solution. Second, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not the fracking chemicals that are coming out of people&#x27;s plumbing and burning spectacularly when they hold a match to the faucet, it&#x27;s the extracted gas. And if fracking is causing gas and flowback from the shale to be introduced into the aquifer then that&#x27;s a huge problem, regardless of the other chemicals involved.<p>> <i>Hydraulic fracturing is not contaminating drinking water. These fractures are being created about 6,000 feet below the surface.... If anything is going to risk the integrity of the drinking water, point the figure at the construction of the well, the steel and concrete barrier that is built to isolate that aquifer from a flowing well.</i><p>> <i>I fully realize that this does not exonerate the oil and gas industry, but hydraulic fracturing is the one getting all the blame for no reason, and by people who clearly need to take a physics class.</i><p>And <i>this</i> is the author&#x27;s main point. She&#x27;s not denying that the oil and gas industry is contaminating drinking water and destroying communities. She&#x27;s just arguing that it&#x27;s the well-builders who are screwing up, not the folks pumping in the contaminants and extracting the gas.<p>I&#x27;m sure the this distinction is very important to the author. She is an engineer who has done hydraulic fracturing for the world&#x27;s largest oilfield service company for 10 years. She probably believes the technology is great.<p>But if hydraulic fracturing brings new wells to town, those wells fail, and the flowback from that fracking process ends up in the drinking water and destroys communities then no one cares about which engineer is to blame within the oilfield company. It&#x27;s still the oilfield company&#x27;s fault.<p>Edit: Tweaked some of the terms I may have been using inaccurately.",1385062621

Let&#x27;s say (as the evidence seems to suggest) that if we interrupt a programmer, even for a minute, we&#x27;re really blowing away 15 minutes of productivity. For this example, lets put two programmers, Jeff and Mutt, in open cubicles next to each other in a standard Dilbert veal-fattening farm. Mutt can&#x27;t remember the name of the Unicode version of the strcpy function. He could look it up, which takes 30 seconds, or he could ask Jeff, which takes 15 seconds. Since he&#x27;s sitting right next to Jeff, he asks Jeff. Jeff gets distracted and loses 15 minutes of productivity (to save Mutt 15 seconds).<p>Now let&#x27;s move them into separate offices with walls and doors. Now when Mutt can&#x27;t remember the name of that function, he could look it up, which still takes 30 seconds, or he could ask Jeff, which now takes 45 seconds and involves standing up (not an easy task given the average physical fitness of programmers!). So he looks it up. So now Mutt loses 30 seconds of productivity, but we save 15 minutes for Jeff.

I&#x27;ve been working with DBAs for years, in my world everyone knows that&#x27;s how CHAR works.  The padding behavior is nothing new, and is intuitive - the value <i>must</i> be N characters in length, so if you stored less, you get back a right-padded string.  This is exactly what I&#x27;d expect.<p>> CHAR semantically represents fixed length text fields from old data file formats<p>and two or three letter character codes like country codes, state codes, etc. are what we use CHAR for, these are fixed length text fields.  They are still in modern use today.    Plus lots of us still have to write apps that actually read old files too - CHAR is appropriate for these as well, assuming you are storing fields that aren&#x27;t right-padded in the source datafile (such as social security numbers, etc.).<p>Your app will of course work with a VARCHAR instead, but the point of CHAR is that it&#x27;s self-documenting as to the type of data to be stored in the field - fixed length, as opposed to variable length.<p>> If you do have different length then a VARCHAR is more appropriate.<p>if you are storing variable length, then you should absolutely use VARCHAR. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called &quot;VAR&quot;, it means, &quot;variable&quot;.<p>> Also a lot of application frameworks that interact with the database only deal with VARCHAR so then as soon as you use a CHAR you have to start worrying about trimming your text data<p>If you are using CHAR correctly, you don&#x27;t have to trim anything, because you are storing a string that is exactly the length of the CHAR type.   I&#x27;m not familiar with how an application framework would only know how to deal with VARCHAR and not CHAR, database adapters return strings for both types.  And if there were such a framework, I&#x27;d not be using it.<p>> one of the biggest database text type gotchas is accidentally trying to compare a VARCHAR and a CHAR improperly.<p>all of which stems from the same, singular mistake - don&#x27;t store variable length data in a CHAR - plus if you are comparing VARCHAR to CHAR, that is also usually doing it wrong, as an adequately normalized database wouldn&#x27;t be repurposing some kind of fixed length datatype out into a VARCHAR of some kind elsewhere.<p>The aforementioned CHECK constraint is a good way to enforce that if the developers/frameworks in question tend to be error-prone about this kind of thing (it&#x27;s not an error I&#x27;ve had much issue with, since I know how CHAR behaves).<p>> While I can see good reasons to include length checks there is never a good reason to use a CHAR unless you&#x27;re trying to interoperate with COBOL programs written in the 80&#x27;s<p>as it turns out a vast portion of the world economy is supported by mainframes and old software that often spits out fixed length datafiles, there is even Python code in my current work project just written in the past six months which is tasked with parsing such files (they are actually quite simple to parse, since you just pull out each field based on an exact position).    Not to mention that boring things like state codes, country codes, and the like are often fixed length fields.",1385061051

In the last 5-10 years, this has become the case.  For instance, this is an example of a bill that &quot;failed&quot; despite receiving a 54-46 vote.<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/04/17/senate-to-vote-on-amendments-to-gun-bill-with-background-check-plan-in-doubt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/04...</a><p>3)  This rule change would only apply to presidential appointments.

Back in the good ol&#x27; days when the filibuster was used with some modicum of restraint, this meant that a minority party could prevent over-ideological candidates from getting elected. But, over time, the process evolved to the point where the party out-of-power would try to block <i>all</i> nominations so that when they were back in-power in several years, they had more vacancies to fill with their own ideologically-pure candidates.<p>Purely in terms of government fulfilling its obligated duties to function, this is an improvement because the judiciary will now become staffed. However, the lack of a filibuster threat will probably push us away from politically neutral appointments, towards an alternating (and hopefully balanced over time?) mix of biases in opposite directions.<p>tl;dr this is why we can&#x27;t have nice things.",1385060612

160390,comment,159924,160195,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This is on the right track, but once again we have the chicken-and-egg problem. You're using your knowledge of history and geography to sort through news feeds, trying to tease out which stories are meaningful. But students have little reason to practice that skill unless they believe that there is meaning to be teased out in the first place. And how are they to know that? It's all <i>I</i> can do to find a reason to read a news feed -- in fact, I don't do it. I get pointed to the most interesting news by reading the blogs of half a dozen news-junkie bloggers, who watch the papers and the TV and link to the articles that are actually significant... often placing them in a larger context at the same time. Otherwise, I ignore the news. I'm already depressed and fearful enough.<p>Those who haven't yet started reading news blogs, though, might find it hard to fall over them by accident. What they <i>will</i> find by accident is CNN and the like, and why should we be surprised when students think that CNN is a waste of time? It <i>is</i> a waste of time -- pseudo-scandals, celebrity gossip, mindless stenography, yammering talking heads, scare stories with blood, flames, and explosions...<p>Give the students a reason to believe that news is valuable and important -- perhaps by raising their political consciousness, as the author of the original article did -- and they'll learn the skills they need to find valuable and important news.",1207864664

The rest of the quote still applies and is not ad hominem.<p>No sense to you, perhaps. Something about not using illegal drugs and not using legal drugs illegally makes sense to me. ""Off the label"" prescriptions are not always legal, btw.<p>Does the reasoning that it's ok to use Ritalin to give smart people a mental edge imply it's ok for athletes to use performance-enhancing drugs? Why not, if steroids and growth hormones are legal for other uses? Others in this thread have implied that steroids are idiotic.<p>Because you are all smart people, you realize that once a few people start doping up on Ritalin and getting better results on grant applications, journal papers, and other tasks, that everyone will pretty much have to join the dope show and take the same drugs. Taking these drugs will become a barrier to entry in order to do science. Eventually, those who want a new mental edge will have to find a new drug, then everyone will take that. That will only go a few rounds before people start destroying their brains and their bodies. Scientists will become junkies and that will do no good for anyone in the long term.<p>Ultimately, if someone wants to take Ritalin or whatever to give them a mental edge, nothing I say here will convince them otherwise. Personally, I don't understand why anyone would need mental enhancement pharma given the assumption that they are already brilliant to begin with.

So in my example the two foo's could represent completely different memory locations and it would still work.<p>Now for your second example; nested define statements do not allocate a top-level memory location. Instead they allocate a local memory location. Consider the following example:<p><pre><code>    > (define foo 1)
    > (let ((bar (lambda (n) (+ foo n))))
        (define foo 2)
        (bar 1))

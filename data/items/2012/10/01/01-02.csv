Try to run a small experiment for the B2C company for customer acquisition. Say spend 20 bucks on google ads and measure the results. Run other types of marketing campaign to get customers. Whether you fail or succeed, send the founders the results(it will help them save time by not working on a channel that doesn't work). This way they see that you actually give a damn about them.

If you compare typical finance jobs to typical real-world software jobs that are available to people without more published papers than years on this planet, then finance wins. That's not to say there aren't bad finance jobs (there are) or that finance is without its problems.<p>The software industry sucks. Programming is fun, but the software industry itself is a horrible place to be unless you have an edge that can consistently guarantee you a stream of high-quality work and no bullshit, and there isn't a much good work to go around in this industry, so that edge really has to be solid. The way you get good at software (and one of the things I admire greatly about software engineers is that a lot of us genuinely care about being good at our jobs; that's a rarity in the corporate world) is to get good work, but you can't get good work unless people think you're good. Hence, there's that need for some sort of edge when you're starting out. Finance, for its flaws, is a pretty good place to get this sort of edge: it gives you a certain credibility that helps you escape ""Just A Programmer"" mediocrity.",1349055317

If you build it and it grows, then you have to hire me as a engineer. :)<p>In all seriousness, the trick to this kind of platform is the following. You have to make it very, very easy to work with. Using confusing API calls will just make people run away from it. I've seen a lot of APIs that are over engineerd with wacky syntax. Try and keep it as simple as possible, as if the developer was writing HTML itself.<p>The only problem with wordpress is the platform itself. In order to build something with it, you are accepting a lot of engineering overhead from past versions. This technical baggage makes it a pain to work it, though not as bad as joomla. By going with the API route, you can change the back end as much as you'd like, but the developers would just see the same API calls. Its like an interface in OOP programming.<p>The last API I did for a client took calls like this:<p>host/category/products/product/id/get<p>to this:<p>host/get/id<p>See how easier it is to develop with that? You dont need to know what category the product belongs to, because that data is passed as a JSON string to you. Once you get it, on your side you just go through the results and display it accordingly.<p>Same with a blog API. I dont need to know the title, just the post ID.

But we can safely assume that 95% of the available talent pool in this category will be employed (and not actively seeking), compared with say 70% in the bottom, or ""sub-elite"" category, at any given time.[2]<p>So for example in a ""town"" of 1000 putative developers, with skill levels ranging from god-like to ""good enough"" to mediocre to utterly bogus and self-deluding, let's say 50 (or 5%) of these are truly ""elite"", and 950 are ""non-elite"".<p>Further, of the elite category, 47.5 will be employed (and not actively looking), and only 2.5 will be in the job market -- versus, out of the 950 non-elite developers, we might have 665 (or 70%) employed, versus 285 (or 30%) on the market and actively looking.<p>Given this over-simplified (but arguably ""less wrong"") hypothesis, and assuming that a given opening draws applicants whose fitness ranking is evenly distributed across the pool of <i>in-the-market</i> candidates, it's easy to see that for any given opening, we'll have a ratio of 2.5:285 for elite:non-elite developers -- or a paltry <i>0.869%</i>(!) of the candidate pool (2.5/287.5) will appear to be from the ""elite"" category.<p>That is, for every 1 ""elite"" resume in your inbox, you'll be seeing 114 ""non-elite"" resumes.  And since tech geeks are, by and large, an insecure, envious lot, they like to brag and fudge a bit -- so that 114 easily becomes 199 in their minds (or the 1 a 0.6, whichever).<p>Which gives you the infamous ""we only hire the top 0.5%"" urban legend right there.  Even though they're all really just angling over the... top 5% (ranked over the general pool of putative developers).<p>And since hot-shots like Joel Spolsky, not to mention nearly all of the investment bank / hedge fund types, and well, probably half or more of everyone in the monthly ""Who's hiring?"" thread just keeps repeating it, and repeating it, and repeating it... well, shucks, it <i>must</i> be true.<p>[1] As such a thing as generic competence exists can be objectively measured, etc, etc, but that's a separate issue.<p>[2] Which corresponds -- conservatively, for the purposes of  this argument -- to another widely espoused, but never quantitatively substantiated belief out in startupland: that ""all"" of the good developers are ""always"" employed and ""almost never"" on the job market longer than 2 days.",1349054133

What other things do you wear a helmet while doing? Between this, ruining peoples' hair, not looking as chic, and the inconvenience of it, helmets discourage people from cycling.<p>* Although it is possible to get seriously injured on a bicycle, the research that I've seen suggests that the health benefits of cycling outweigh the risk of injury considerably (even when not wearing helmets), so, from a public health point of view, it makes sense to encourage cycling, and even cycling without wearing a helmet.<p>* Therefore, it seems that helmets directly save lives (in crashes, although, for my own anecdotal evidence, they haven't helped me in any of the crashes I've had), but they cost lives indirectly by discouraging people from cycling in the first place. This makes it harder to sell.<p>* Laws are not about making things as safe as humanly possible. It would save more lives to have people in cars wearing helmets, but we don't do that (yes, I know more people travel by car). For that matter, it's legal to drive cars that would be considered death-traps by modern safety standards. Even if helmet laws did save lives, that doesn't automatically mean they should become laws.<p>* The drivers in different countries have different attitudes towards cyclists. In Australia (and probably America), we have a strong driving culture, and a very ""us vs. them"" view of the whole thing. Earlier this year, Shane Warne (one of the most famous Australian sportsmen of the last decade) had an altercation with a cyclist on a busy Melbourne road which led him to comment on Twitter about how cyclists should pay registration and show license plates. Views like that are very common amongst the general public, and often stem from the view that ""bikes are okay for a gentle Sunday ride with the family to the park, but they shouldn't be used as serious transportation devices"". Compare that with the attitude of the average driver in many European countries (from what I've heard), and you might be able to make a case that we aren't ready for scrapping mandatory helmet laws, because cycling really is more dangerous.",1349053504

4594843,comment,4593902,4594191,2,0,jt2190,,,"> Folks in the US need to start demanding bike lanes from their elected officials.<p>North American bike lanes, as they're currently implemented, in general, are easily criticized because they don't actually buy a safer ride for cyclists. They buy the illusion of a safer ride[1].<p>Some of the problems:<p><pre><code>  * Bicycles going straight through an intersection are encouraged to overtake cars \n    that are turning right on their right side. The motor vehicle can turn into the \n    path of the overtaking cyclist.\n  * Bicycles going straight through an intersection are encouraged to stay close to \n    the curb, where they can be hidden from the view of drivers turning left into \n    their path by cars that are traveling in the same direction and slightly \n    ahead of them. The left-turning car then turns behind the car travelling in \n    the same direction as the cyclist and into the cyclist.\n  * Bicycle lanes widen the travel lane, encouraging drivers to travel \n    at higher speeds.\n</code></pre>\nThere are bike lanes that actually encourage safer riding habits, but they're far less common, so the overall statistics don't show decreased accident rates when bike lanes are added.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bike_lane#Crash_types.2C_junctions_and_arterials"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bike_lane#Crash_types.2C_junct...</a>",1349053348

Right now, that's nothing, but since HTTP::Engine is basically extracted from Catalyst, getting Catalyst to run will be easy.  But it also means that we'll get other Perl frameworks like CGI::App (they've indicated interest, anyway), Continuity, Jifty (perhaps), etc.<p>The Python guys may be happy with one framework... but this is Perl.  There's more than one way to do it :)<p>BTW, I'm a Catalyst core developer, so I'll certainly do everything I can to make working with Catalyst on GAE enjoyable.  That's what I want for <i>my</i> applications.  But really, getting the web framework to work is the easy part.  Getting a Perl that meets Google's requirements is the hard part.",1216850204

Most of the people in my hometown who chose religious would beat you over the head with how good of a Christian they are and criticize you for not following what was clearly the One True Way. My father-in-law is proud of being a religious man and it's frustrating that he's unwilling to accept other's beliefs.<p>The ones who chose spiritual were much more pleasant to be around. My spiritual friends usually let me know what time their churches' main events kick off and that I have a standing invite if I decide I'm interested. Most of the time I forget they go to church X until I ask them to do something and they have prior plans involving their church. They also don't brag about their work within the community. They tend to be the type who will say ""Glad I could help"" and really mean it when someone thanks them. In contrast, my father-in-law is proud of how religious he is and gets upset if he feels he wasn't properly recognized for his good works.<p>I've noticed that certain types of communities (usually the mainstream ones aimed at moms) tend to also be more religious than not. They're ok communities until something that has a religious aspect comes up and then it's witch hunting time. I've also run across a few niche Christian sites when looking for things related to my hobbies. They don't seem to have flame war issues, but they have closed forums for the main discussions and public forums to vet new members.",1216849490

Rather, I assume that people respond to incentives. When people have incentive to live peaceful and orderly lives, they tend to do it more than when those incentives are lacking.<p>I find it mystifying that the ""progressive"" type assumes that citizens will behave stupidly and violently but that they will somehow elect smart, saintly public servants to guide them.<p>I accept the Public Choice critique of government. I believe that government actors are just ordinary people like you and me and that they also respond to incentives. Disturbingly, they often have only very weak incentives to act for the public good, but strong incentives to SAY they are working for the public good, which I think explains much of what we see in politics. I don't think giving someone power will instantly make them a selfless angel.<p>Libertarianism is a realist philosophy, and it outperforms other philosophies in addressing the real world.",1216848838

The pilot is checked by a doctor, and the only information publicized is a ""pass/fail"". Any conditions remain between the pilot and the doctor, and in particular any conditions which are irrelevant to the task at hand. (If Jobs has erectile dysfunction, no one would ever know)<p>Anyhow: The way Apple works today, there is little reason the SEC should be involved. Everybody knows that Jobs kept a life-threatening illness from investors until the last minute, and everybody knows that the company would be in deep shit if he had died. Hence, the risk of him keeping any current serious condition secret is known to investors and the share price reflects this. This is also why a (minor?) issue such as this one causes so much noise.

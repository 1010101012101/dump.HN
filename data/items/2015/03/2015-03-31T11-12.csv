9295552,comment,9289612,9290750,0,0,evanpw,,,"1. Even Apple borrows money for buybacks rather than spending their giant cash hoard. The reason is taxes. Companies have a lot of cash generated overseas, and if they brought that cash back into the US in order to buy back stock, they would have to pay US corporate income tax on it, at a rate of something like 35%. From that perspective, a 2% fee to the bankers is a steal.<p>2. As far as I know, most corporate bonds don&#x27;t have a floating interest rate, so those companies have the option of paying off the bonds at maturity and then just not borrowing more if interest rates have risen. They don&#x27;t have to continue the buybacks under that scenario, because investors don&#x27;t expect buybacks to be consistent from year to year -- another advantage over dividends.<p>3. Pouring money into R&D instead of returning money to shareholders only makes sense if the company can get a better rate of return than shareholders can get somewhere else. For a large, mature company that may well not be true. In that case, they should stick to what they do well, send the profits back to the shareholders, and let them invest it into some growing company which can make better use of the money.",1427802076

Unlike most of our parents, we&#x27;re staying in the city to raise kids despite having the option of moving to the burbs. The sidewalks in my neighborhood are choked with strollers on weekends. And apparently little league and soccer leagues are turning away a large portion of families who want to register and still having trouble finding enough fields for all their teams to play.<p>This is happening to the degree that preschool admissions are now hypercompetitive because so many upper middle class parents want to give their kids the best possible chance to get into a magnet or private elementary school so they can go to a good high school and get into an Ivy League college.<p>I wonder if part of the reason this is happening is that kids in the suburbs are now allowed to roam and play unsupervised so much less than our generation was that it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference whether they&#x27;re in the city or the suburbs since they&#x27;re going to be indoors most of the time anyway. If you&#x27;re going to supervise all their outdoor time anyway, might as well just take them to the park.<p>Besides, you can argue that for younger teens the city is much better than the suburbs. Instead of those too young to drive themselves hanging around in bunches and making trouble out of sheer boredom, those groups walk around the (actually interesting) neighborhood, go to the park, take themselves to a movie or poke around in their favorite stores.

And you wished to combine them in the natural way to get `h`:<p><pre><code>  h :: b -> c
  h x = g (f x) x 
</code></pre>
Then, to achieve the same with S, K and I combinators we do the following (assuming we have SKI representations of `f, g` as `F, G`.<p><pre><code>  H := S(S(KG)F)I

</code></pre>
The `x` has disappeared! But, if we apply H to some CL expression `X` we get:<p><pre><code>  HX = S(S(KG)F)IX
     = S(KG)FX(IX)    ;; apply S
     = KGX(FX)(IX)    ;; apply S   
     = G(FX)(IX)      ;; apply K
     = G(FX)X         ;; apply I
</code></pre>
We can use S to Split (duplicate) parameters, and K to Kill (ignore) parameters, in a very straight forward way. Imagine the AST of the original code:<p><pre><code>     App
     /\
    /  \
   App  x
   /\
  / App
  g /\
   /  \
   f  x
</code></pre>
Every `App` is replaced with an `S`, every `x` with an `I`, everything else (`y`) is replaced with `Ky`. In my example, I have also gone to the trouble of &quot;optimising&quot; `S(KF)I` away, as it is equivalent to just `F`.<p>Interesting stuff, and plenty of theoretical grounding to boot. Especially as this sort of thing has started enjoying a renaissance, in the likes of &quot;point-free&quot; notation in languages like Haskell.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine</a>

9295534,comment,9294058,9295040,0,0,xaetium,,,"In these types of quantum reality-probing experiments, any problems of experimental design that affect the validity of the findings are referred to as loopholes, as though there&#x27;s some awkward legal wrangling going on, because the experiments were conceived originally to determine whether the controversial Bell&#x27;s inequalities hold. The inequalities were designed to test Bell&#x27;s theorem which states that any hidden variables (things not yet observed that have a causal influence on experimental outcome) are required to be non-local if they are to hold with the predictions of quantum mechanics. Non-local here means &#x27;spooky action at a distance&#x27;.<p>Showing the inequalities to be violated (incorrect by experiment) was originally controversial because Einstein and Bohr had differing notions of what the quantum mechnical theory implied about reality. They engaged in a lengthy, open discussion about it which was never resolved. Einstein believed in local realism, in which there is no spooky action at a distance and properties like position and momentum exist even when not being measured. Bohr, on the other hand, insisted that there simply wasn&#x27;t an underlying reality and that only when measurements are made are properties like position and momentum condensed out of the quantum mechanical reality. So, you see, the significance of the experiment is in line with the underlying nature of reality; by closing another loophole, we get closer to what&#x27;s what.<p>[The rest here is historical context.]<p>The familiar refrain, &quot;God does not play dice,&quot; is almost always taken out of context - within its original statement, Einstein was also talking about a kind of telepathy required with it - the non-local aspect of quantum mechanics. Einstein said in 1954 &#x27;it is not possible to get rid of the statistical character of the present quantum theory by merely adding something to the latter, without changing the fundamental concepts about the whole structure&#x27;. He was saying he lost conviction in using a hidden variable theory to replace quantum mechanics.<p>Bohr&#x27;s view, like Einstein&#x27;s later view, is more in line with modern thinking. A team led by Aspect in 1981-82 ruled out either locality or objective reality, by testing the inequalities experimentally. This left possible a non-local reality. In 2006, a group tested Leggett&#x27;s inequality, and showed it to be violated, which refined experimentally what the nature of reality is, though showed only that realism and a certain type of non-locality are incompatible, without ruling out <i>all</i> possible non-local models. (Nature, April 2007) Aspect remarked that philosophically, the &#x27;conclusion one draws is more a question of taste than logic&#x27;.",1427801657

Until that changes, it will always discourage potential cyclists.<p>Whether it&#x27;s cars who will literally chase you down and scream about how they &quot;deserve to be on the road and you don&#x27;t&quot;, or people who open doors into the bike lane without checking for cyclist etc.<p>Ironically, I find it actually tends to be the lower socio-economic areas that find the concept of cycling most puzzling.<p>In the more expensive areas, cycling seems to be more of a thing - sadly, road cycling is a rich man&#x27;s hobby here - when you have groups of Cervelo and Bianchi&#x27;s out on weekends, those people <i>often</i> tend to be a bit more considerate when you&#x27;re on the road yourself during the week.<p>I do wish cycling was more mainstream, or at least car drivers better educated - but I don&#x27;t think that removing helmets is the way to do that.",1427800483

9295458,comment,9293498,9293498,0,0,dirktheman,,,"As a dutchman visiting New York City a couple years back, naturally I rented a bike. A couple of random observations:<p>- NYC in theory is ideal for traversing by bicycle. Congested yet flat, much like (old) Amsterdam<p>- It&#x27;s not so much the lack of bike lanes in the city, it&#x27;s more the ignorance of drivers that poses a threat. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I was cut off, simply because the driver didn&#x27;t see me or didn&#x27;t expect a cyclist.<p>- On the other hand, fellow cyclists were behaving like mad men. I can totally see why people are having issues with cyclists. Running red lights, taking sidewalks, zooming in front of cars, that doesn&#x27;t get you a lot of understanding.<p>- Cycling in Central Park is somewhat annoying: joggers use the bike lane because they&#x27;re faster than normal pedestrians. I&#x27;ve been given a stink eye more than once because I wanted to overtake a jogger. How dare I use a bicycle on a bike lane...<p>- The Manhattan Waterfront Greenway is fantastic! Except for the parts where it suddenly stops and you&#x27;re forced to cycle through heavy traffic to get around the UN building (taking 1st or 2nd Avenue). I get that this is an ongoing project, but can they at least alert drivers that they&#x27;re sharing the road with cyclists at that point?<p>- I did wear a bike helmet while cycling in NYC, but I wouldn&#x27;t think of it at home. Cycling is relatively safe here because of the minimal speed difference when you share the road. This is backed up by numbers: there are currently 19 million bicycles and 8 million cars on 16 million inhabitants. About 25% of all movements is made by bicycle. Last year, 212 people died in a car crash, and 112 people died in bicycle accidents. The vast majority in these cases were one-sided accidents by elderly people. In perspective: only 2 children died in bike accidents.",1427800203

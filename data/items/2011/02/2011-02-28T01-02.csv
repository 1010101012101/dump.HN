2269561,comment,2269083,2269083,0,0,A1kmm,,,"The core point makes sense, although I don't think there is a clear line between 'rule' and 'exception'; instead, the influence of companies probably follows something like a power law on metrics like 'how many people recognise the brand' - there are a few heavy hitters like Facebook, and a long tail of much less recognised companies.<p>I don't agree with their analysis that there is no bubble in Facebook's valuation because Facebook has revenue; you can't look at one company in isolation and say 'they aren't part of a bubble', you need to look at the big picture. Facebook has value because it has a lot of users and information on those users, and can use the information to target ads at those users. As pg has pointed out before, the 2000 dot-com bubble also had players like Yahoo bringing in high advertising revenues. Advertising revenues are much lower now compared to then on a CPC or CPM basis, but, especially for some targeted users / keywords, are still very high, and companies using them probably make a loss  paid for from capital unless they have very high LPVs for customers, or from advertising revenue.<p>In other words, advertising revenue is largely hot air circulating inside the bubble, and VC capital and cross-subsidisation from other areas pays to inject into the bubble. Some companies operate entirely in the bubble - they receive large amounts of bubble advertising revenue and reinject into the bubble by spending it on advertising, to cannibalise someone else's bubble revenue. Bubbles aren't stable - as soon as investors lose confidence in the market, investment will slow down, so there will be less advertising spend, which will reduce both direct and indirect advertising revenue and reduce confidence further.",1298855096

Developers will (grudgingly) share power with equal or better programmers than themselves, but the gnu version of the open source movement is explicitly designed to put all the power into the programmers hands, and any non-programmers should ""just learn to program"".<p>The are two other things that programmers tend to do:<p>(1) we hate redundancy<p>(2) if something is obvious to a programmer, he thinks it is obvious to everyone else that that is the way it should be done (despite a simple survey of his peers revealing probably 4-6 different ways of achieving exactly the same result).<p>Programmers believe that their way is better than everyone else's <i>and</i> that it is intuitive as well (well, it was 'intuitive' to one guy on the team (ie me), and I'm 'smart' so that must be the best and most intuitive way of doing it, right?)<p>Unfortunately, good UI design has enormous amounts of redundancy built into it, and that if there is only one way of doing something, it is actually anti-intuitive.  A design where the user can try 3 things out and the third one works will be hailed as a paragon of intuitiveness.  One where it takes 10-20 tries to get the magic combination will be viewed as having a horrible UI.<p>There is also a relationship between how easy it is to do simple things and how the user perceives the UI.  Programs which make it hard (ie go read a couple of hundred man pages in order to figure out the flags you need) even to do simple things are viewed as bad, even if it turns out that the same amount of difficulty can also achieve amazingly difficult things.<p>Basically what it boils down to is that in order to fix the design of an open source project, you would essentially have to fork it.  And having forked it and fixed it, the high priests of the programmer cult will despise your efforts because there is too much redundancy.",1298854856

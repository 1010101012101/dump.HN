Maybe a letter or report or two...<p>But the main thing that drew me to PDF utilities was to programmatically fill out pre-existing PDF forms.  With FPDI i would load in the form and then overlay the data on top of it.  Not as easy as charts and tables, as some data exists as one line per row and other might have several lines per row of data. different positions, etc.  (here's a fun form I had worked with: <a href=""http://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/entres/forms/English/CD9600.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/entres/forms/English/CD9600.P...</a> depending of family size or care situation could be multiple pages...)

It may be commonly <i>assumed</i> that the term ""thread"", in absence of any other qualifier, refers to OS-level threads, however even that is context dependent. The Wikipedia page introduction is poorly written.<p>However the more salient point here is the OP was either being lazy by saying ""goroutines are not threads"", or actually doesn't understand the concept of lightweight threads.

Though I am working at my own startup now, the absurdness of the interviewing process at majority of such places confounds me.<p>In short, I can't cope up with them well without going through quite a few glassdoor type questions of that respective company. And partially it is because most interviewers already have a set of solutions that they are looking for, and can't appreciate novel solutions and at times even better time/space complexity if they do not fit the standard mold. In my experience only some very hot startups had smart/ open enough interviewers to appreciate new solutions or see the relevance of new CS research results that may solve their question.<p>Before one starts attacking me on being a CS philistine, I want you to ponder on my background- current work involves designing & implementing pretty intricate & complex algorithms, and earlier research & publications in a range of ML related sub-fields, mainly NLP & recommender systems. I also read CS papers for pleasure, code in multiple languages and did reasonably well in programming competitions- no longer participate, latter is many years ago.<p>For a similar experience, though from a far more accomplished person, see Tanya Khovanova's blog post on hiring 'the smartest people in the world':

But to equate the measurer with the measure is somewhat foolish, because it's a means to an end, not the end itself.

And we are talking NC here, not Silicon Valley or New York.  Maybe things are radically different there.

When I hear ""bootstrapped startup"" that doesn't - to me - mean a company which is intended to remain a single-person company, or to be a ""lifestyle business"" or whatever.  In my book, the goal is the same, bootstrapping vs. VC are just different tactical elements on the path.<p><i>But, outside of rare exceptions which are known but uncommon, a bootstrapped company is not going to become a billion dollar company without any outside funding.</i><p>You're probably right in the strictest sense.  But one might be a hundred million dollar company, which is still a different order or achievement than the retaurant/plumber/dry-cleaner type deal.<p><i>And the reward is generally lower too - a steady income stream that can go upwards of high six, maybe lower seven figures. Obviously if you want to keep building, hiring more people, etc, then it starts to look more like a ""regular"" company.</i><p>Of course I'm biased, since we (Fogbeam Labs) are choosing the bootstrapping approach for now, and we aspire to be a billion dollar company one day.  But the ""for now"" may be the key point in that sentence.  We haven't unilaterally ruled out taking outside money someday, but we don't feel the need right now.<p><i>compared to a startup backed by venture funding that needs to reach hundreds of millions in revenue to be a ""success"".</i><p>Yeah, if we don't eventually reach the ""hundreds of millions in revenue"" I'll feel like we failed.  The only exception would be in the event of an acquisition.  If we got acquired while still bootstrapping, a much smaller acquisition could result in a financial windfall for the founders, since we retain (between us, at the moment) 100% of the equity in the company.  But it would still need to be enough to give us ""FU Money"" or I'll feel like we failed. :-)",1367202202

5623728,comment,5622533,5623574,3,0,jasonshen,,,"I would say that bootstrapped single-technical-founder software companies are more likely to succeed, because it only needs to generate enough revenue to support one person, and software is relatively low cost to build and deliver (compared to a food/restaurant) compared to a startup backed by venture funding that needs to reach hundreds of millions in revenue to be a ""success"".<p>And the reward is generally lower too - a steady income stream that can go upwards of high six, maybe lower seven figures. Obviously if you want to keep building, hiring more people, etc, then it starts to look more like a ""regular"" company. But, outside of rare exceptions which are known but uncommon, a bootstrapped company is not going to become a billion dollar company without any outside funding.<p>That's what I mean by risk/reward. Certainly time is a big ""cost"" but again, the ""risk of failure"" in a bootstrapped software company is lower than a venture backed startup.",1367201414

Now imagine that the entire adult population of America is walking past you in a single hour, in ascending order of income.<p>The first passers-by, the owners of loss-making businesses, are invisible: their heads are below ground. Then come the jobless and the working poor, who are midgets. After half an hour the strollers are still only waist-high, since America's median income is only half the mean. It takes nearly 45 minutes before normal-sized people appear. But then, in the final minutes, giants thunder by. With six minutes to go they are 12 feet tall.

I know coding questions as posed in interviews are not the best measure of job performance, but they are also one of the few we have that is guaranteed to be sourced from the candidate in question. To perform well at these sorts of questions, you should be familiar with basic algorithms and techniques. It's a common language that you and the interviewer can speak.

They have a <i>Verifiability, reproducibility, and working description policy</i> which reads as follows<p><i></i><i>Starting from 2011, CICLing implements a policy of giving preference to papers with verifiable and reproducible results:<p>If the authors claim to have obtained some results, we encourage them to make all the input data necessary to verify and reproduce the results available to the community.<p>If the authors claim to advance human knowledge by introducing an algorithm, we encourage them to make the algorithm itself -- and not only its (usually vague and incomplete) description -- available to the public.
We do not require any demo or tool based on your paper, but instead a form of proof and working description of the algorithm in addition to the verbal description given in your paper. An approximation of the idea is the code submitted with Church & Umemura's paper to be permanently hosted at CICLing servers, and cited in the paper (see last line): you see, we don't mean anything complicated. Obviously, you are also encouraged to show demo programs or tools based on your method, either as part of your talk or (better) at the demo session, and we will also be happy to host on our servers such software that complements your paper. However, this is not required. In contrast, we do believe that a publicly published scientific paper must be accompanied by a minimal working description of the algorithm, open-source and available to the community.<p>Also, we do not ask for impossible: if you present a large system, especially commercially distributed or a property of your company, then we do not expect you to provide the system. Our point is that when the software and data can be provided, it should be provided.<p>We do not yet have specific rules: we hope to elaborate the rules basing on this year's experience, so please use common sense. See the problems this policy is to address, as well as the list of software reviewing committee and instructions for the reviewers.</i><i></i><p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cicling.org/2013/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cicling.org/2013/</a>",1367200805

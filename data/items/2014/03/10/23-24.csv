Four years of <i>uptime</i>. The smallest of the Kimsufi, which is already the cheaper of the dedicated servers OVH provides. Four years.<p>A pretty stock Debian, with only SSH and Tomcat and not a single (known) root exploit forcing me to install a patch that would have required me to reboot the box. Meanwhile I had two very serious DoS Java bugs requiring me to patch the JVM / JRE (IIRC the Tomcat version I had could do with just the JRE, no need for the JDK). One Java exploit was the infinite floating-point parsing bug and the other the hashmap not being O(1) anymore (the attack consisted in submitting very long URL with carefully query paramaters).<p>Now the real funny thing: one day I got an email from OVH saying my server was down and that it &quot;would not reboot&quot;. What happened is that the motherboard died and they moved my stuff to a new system. But the Debian version on my Kimsufi was so old that it wouldn&#x27;t recognize the new motherboard...<p>That&#x27;s basically how stable Kimsufi are: they can happily crank up for years and years and years and years.<p>Now I&#x27;ll have to look into it: because I pay 20 EUR / month for mine (VAT not included) and apparently the new ones at 17 EUR / month are already more powerful than the ones I have, so I may want to switch to a beefier machine for a cheaper price.<p>Also note that during summer time (month of august IIRC), they launched a Kimsufi at 2.99 or 3.99 EUR / month (don&#x27;t remember, but several people here point the number of 2.99). But it got so successful that they had issue and were forced to remove the offer. And &quot;Octave&quot; tweeted that OVH would come up with an entirely new offer. I&#x27;m glad to see they&#x27;re now offering Kimsufi at 8 EUR / month.<p>That&#x27;s 8 EUR for your own dedicated server. Seems quite a good deal to me.",1394495971

7376536,comment,7372997,7372997,3,0,jakejake,,,"I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s, still programming away but basically have been building and leading teams for a while.  As it turns out I really like working on improving process.  I&#x27;ve watched friends my age burn out and leave the industry.  A lot of the guys that dropped out were people that weren&#x27;t really obsessed with computers, but rather just chose that as their major - possibly for financial reasons.  I can see how all of the minutia could get annoying, but I just see it as part of the business.<p>For me it&#x27;s not just about building things anymore.  It&#x27;s more about what I consider - building things and doing it with style.  Give me the time to plan an app, put together a team, predict our finish date and then build our system.  My goal is to do it with the team feeling happy and proud of their work the whole way.  No horrible crunch mode or last-minute heroics.  At this point in my career that&#x27;s what I aim for more so than just getting an app built.<p>I also like helping young people become proficient, reliable developers who know how to plan and maintain large systems.  Young developers tend to have a lot of clever ideas and know the latest tools - but I have various skills that they lack or find uninteresting.  So I don&#x27;t see them as competition. I think young and old developers can really compliment each other.<p>As for salary, it&#x27;s hard for me to say since I&#x27;m in year 5 of a startup venture that just hit the black last year and is looking towards being a profitable company.  So whether or not I will ever be looking for another job is something that I&#x27;m unsure about.  I&#x27;ve pretty much decided that I would like to manage larger teams - not because I have to but because I enjoy it.",1394495912

Do you use them ?<p>And as my example vs the OP&#x27;s article with arduino, it seems that micro python offers a much better interface to said libraries.

7376500,comment,7375642,7376084,3,0,dap,,,"> In particular, you often don&#x27;t want to actually force I/O to happen immediately, since for performance reasons it&#x27;s better for the kernel to buffer as much as it wants.<p>If you don&#x27;t issue an fsync(), the kernel never has to write anything.  If you had a different function that did what you suggest, returning when the kernel had decided to write the data (without instructing the kernel to do so soonish), you could literally be waiting forever.  If the function ever returned, it would only be because something else on the system asked for a sync (and it was easier to write everything), or because you&#x27;re operating on a filesystem that chooses to write data sooner than required.  Both of these are basically working by accident (i.e., may well not work on other POSIX systems).<p>I think what you really want is to instruct the kernel that this data should be written out, and you want to block until that happens.  That&#x27;s exactly what fsync() is supposed to do.  The fact that some kernels hammer the I/O subsystem while doing so is a bug in those kernels, not the fsync() interface.",1394495557

Which is not terrible if you lock something in.  However, once you are at 4x paying for schools becomes a far greater challenge. You could be looking at anywhere for $175-250 per kid. So, capitalize this and you are at $350-500K. That is, your combined &quot;future obligations&quot; would be something in the range of $1.7 to $2.0MM (exclusive of retirement). Which is something closer to 6.5x gross income. Which is pretty highly leveraged. You&#x27;re after tax cash flow without real-estate tax shields could easily be ~200k, so you are looking at something like 10x cash-flow leverage. That is about as high as most PE guys will take a decent c-corp.<p>Just start shielding your income and assets as soon as possible. Strategize to minimize exposure to asset inflation (housing, education). The IRS (tax man) and the &quot;doo gooders&quot; in academia (ironically, the new &quot;alternative minimum tax&quot; man) have really boxed in the middle class (read: the not-rich enough) from the perspective of lifetime earnings. Most of your &quot;savings&quot; will be at risk to get swept from you, thanks to &quot;financial aid&quot; effect driving college tuitions.<p>These numbers get bounced around every now and then but they are worth considering. Inflation in &quot;raw materials costs&quot; for knowledge workers (kids) need to get passed on to customers (ie, employers) if you want to stay in the same place (red queen effect and all that).<p>This is relevant when you are evaluating career moves down the road.<p>========<p>3 bedrooms (Weekly Average Prices, San Francisco)<p>$1,339,274 \n$1,573,313\n$1,805,297\n$1,720,736",1394494852

There were few reasons to use Ruby in the English-speaking world back then, unless you were a language magpie or had very simple needs and didn&#x27;t already have a scripting language in your toolkit.<p>I didn&#x27;t do much with it until 2004, when Dave told me to check out the nascent Rails. (I&#x27;d already failed to convince my employer to cover Ruby in more detail even though many of the clever and insightful people I knew had started to pay attention.) We published the first Rails article anyway, and it was a good thing we did.<p>Even then, I didn&#x27;t use Rails seriously myself because it and Ruby offered no benefits and only drawbacks. It was slower and had fewer libraries and worse tools than what I was already using. (Unlike a lot of Rails adopters, I wasn&#x27;t primarily working in either J2EE or PHP.)<p>In 2014, even with Ruby and Rails off of their 2007 peaks, the metrics have changed a little bit. Ruby and Rails have better job prospects, in my experience, while the tooling and ecosystem and languages themselves are roughly equivalent. (One&#x27;s better in some aspects and the other is better in others.)<p>Funny thing, though. It seems like around here Rails or Django are the old guard--the conservative technologies no one will lift an eyebrow at you using--and things like single-page client applications served by Node.js are the exciting technologies with new libraries and frameworks announced every week.<p>Some of those will succeed. Some will fail. Given that I&#x27;m not 14 or 19 or 22 anymore, that I spend my days working hard to deliver value for clients and/or employers, and that I have other things to do on nights and weekends than sit in front of a computer, where do I focus my time and energy and resources so that I can both get things done well now <i>and</i> continue to be employable for the next fifteen or twenty or thirty years?<p><i>That</i> is what the article was about, not calling everything but Perl a fad.",1394494527

7376425,comment,7372574,7376303,1,0,nostrademons,,,"Example 1: You have a group of people who care deeply about performance, reliability, maintainability, and long-term health of the code base.  You have another group of people who care deeply about user experience, development velocity, and pushing features to market quickly.  In an open allocation system these two mindsets will self-organize into different teams, and will avoid working on each others&#x27; projects.  The former group will find that the latter are cowboys who throw together messes that they then have to clean up.  The latter will find that the former are slow killjoys who result in mediocre products delivered late.  The latter group will get to market first, which makes the former believe they&#x27;re marginalized and gets most of them to quit the company.  When the product inevitably starts creaking at the seams, there will be nobody around to fix it and introduce robust development processes.<p>In a formal org, these would likely be two job functions (call them &quot;SRE&quot; and &quot;SWE&quot;, or &quot;Infrastructure&quot; and &quot;Features&quot;, say) who are forced by upper management to work on the same codebase.  Disagreements between them become explicit negotiations where all the technical issues and trade-offs are laid on the table, and then people can come to an agreement after looking at <i>all</i> the considerations.<p>Example 2: You have a brilliant developer who is terrible at working with other people and doesn&#x27;t particularly want to deal with them.  In an open-allocation world, he will end up shunned; nobody will want to work with him.  In a managed org, it&#x27;s often possible for his manager to pick off a certain really difficult technical challenge, have him go off and find a solution, and then interface with the rest of the group via some technical API.<p>Example 3: You have a technical lead who can&#x27;t let go of the technical aspects, and insists on taking all the most interesting work for himself.  In an open-allocation world, nobody will want to work with him, which means that he won&#x27;t be a tech lead for very long, and eventually he&#x27;ll probably get frustrated and leave.  A manager could gently explain to him that taking all the most interesting work is incompatible with being a team lead, and have him choose one or the other.<p>Example 4: You have a project where consistency is the whole benefit of the project.  For example, you&#x27;re doing a company-wide visual redesign to make the company&#x27;s product offerings more consistent for users, or you&#x27;re introducing a language styleguide, or you&#x27;re defining standard APIs for communication between components.  These efforts typically never succeed unless they have top-down support from a strong leader.  Everybody sees the need to agree on a standard, but when it comes to deciding what that standard <i>is</i>, everybody has their own agenda and nobody has authority to decide in favor of one alternative or the other.<p>Standards committees are good public examples of this: officially, it&#x27;s &quot;open allocation&quot; where every company and member of the public who wants a voice has one, but unofficially they&#x27;re dominated by the actions of people who can afford to implement and bring to market a concrete solution.",1394494509

7376320,comment,7372274,7376066,1,0,gnaffle,,,"I think the biggest issue with nuclear energy is public trust. It was broken with Chernobyl, and broken again with Fukushima. I&#x27;ve always been pro-nuclear, and have spent a lot of time arguing why it&#x27;s better than many of the alternatives, especially coal. But people just don&#x27;t trust it anymore. It may not be a problem in China, but in democratic countries it&#x27;s a big problem.<p>One of the things I and many pro-nuclear people claimed was that todays reactors were designed with so many safeguards and precautions and what-ifs that the risk of a large scale disaster was so slim that it could pretty much be discounted. Chernobyl was an understandable one-off.<p>And people believed this story. The public&#x27;s perception of nuclear energy was just about recovered when Fukushima happened.<p>Fukushima exposed real problems with TEPCO and their planning that went undiscovered by Japans nuclear agency or the IAEA. You would think that they would have planned for this worst case scenario, but they didn&#x27;t (they did not expect a tsunami to knock out the generators). So how can we expect people to feel safe about other nuclear plants? We can again try to explain all the safeguards, but they will remain unconvinced because the trust is again lost.<p>Like if you tell an airline passenger that it&#x27;s extremely unlikely for turbulence to cause damage to the aircraft and then half a wing breaks off, they&#x27;re not going to trust you again no matter what you say, even though what you said was true.<p>So now we will have to wait even more years to gain the trust back by having a perfect safety record. Except for the next 20 years or so we will have gradual news to remind us about Fukushima as they bit by bit disassemble the plant and learn more about what exactly happened in the reactors.",1394493205

7376283,comment,7373633,7375986,1,0,rxl,,,"Hey Thomas, thanks for your comments.<p>1) Every username system has some limitation on usernames. Look at Twitter. There are 650 million twitter users, and all of them picked usernames in the same global namespace. This demonstrates that using a global namespace is quite doable.<p>2) You&#x27;re right, people usually have multiple Bitcoin addresses and quite a few people prefer to use different addresses for different transactions. However, the protocol is extensible and is not limited to a single address. In the future, the protocol will support a list of bitcoin addresses instead of a single address. Further, you can use a hierarchical bitcoin address and direct people to different addresses in the hierarchy. In that sense, the bitcoin address listed is just a way to identify the tree of addresses the user owns. Last, the protocol supports data to be linked to from the blockchain, so if you want, you can have a next pointer lead to an API endpoint that returns a different bitcoin address every time.<p>3) As far as supporting only [a-z0-9_], those are the characters that most username systems support, including twitter. Some say this is due to the fact that those are the only &quot;word&quot; characters. Also, using this set makes it more difficult to confuse addresses. The domain name system has similar restrictions for similar reasons. I know that international readability takes a bit of a hit, but I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll find ways to improve the experience. We&#x27;re all up for suggestions.",1394492799

However, he probably has some sort of genetic predisposition to have cancer at such a young age, which can also have an impact on survival.\nThat being said, a few things to keep in mind: survival estimates are notoriously bad. Moreover, oncologists tend to do a poor job of communicating those estimates. 35% chances of being alive in 2 years? in 5 years? alive but living with &quot;active&quot; cancer? Very important points.<p>A reasonable thing to do would be to ask his oncologist &quot;if there are any other options he could think of&quot;.

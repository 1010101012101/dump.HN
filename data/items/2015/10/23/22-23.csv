Are you really insisting they will provide anything other than fancy looking statistics for self-important bureaucrats?<p>While I don&#x27;t know the history of the particular codes, a lot of the hyperspecific codes are driven by needs of insurance payers (public and private) and their desire to incorporate elements that would otherwise be identified in (comparatively costly) non-automated review and provide the necessary resolution in coding that they can be identified and distinguished without that review and the associated cost.<p>Driving down that area of administrative costs is a different thing than providing fancy looking statistics for self-important bureaucrats.",1445641189

Years of learning X things combined with Y perception creates a unique human.<p>However, it&#x27;s not about being unique either. That&#x27;s just a label and means nothing in reality. The pursuit of specialness is properly defined and labeled as vanity. There&#x27;s something better than that in all of us -- some drive to help other, to improve our own lives to improve others&#x27; lives, to guide others into doing the same, the desire to connect, the desire to love, the desire to impart wisdom onto others.

10441595,comment,10439767,10439767,0,0,swombat,,,"Interesting article, but I&#x27;m sad to observe that Bellows stopped short of actually implementing his vision of transparency, in a number of ways. If he&#x27;s reading this, I&#x27;d suggest having a wander through my articles at <a href=""http://danieltenner.com/open-cultures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danieltenner.com/open-cultures</a> and seeing if some ideas there are interesting...<p>Here&#x27;s an example:<p>> Take compensation information, for example. At Yesware, that’s kept strictly private. Not only does Bellows feel his employees are entitled to discretion around what they earn, he also knows that it’s in the company’s best interest to avoid any negative feelings around discrepancies. Moreover, there’s nothing to be gained from sharing that information; it doesn’t boost trust, for example, or help team members assume more responsibility.<p>I strongly disagree with this. There is a <i>lot</i> to be gained by sharing pay information openly. Compensation is indeed a very emotional topic, and it&#x27;s one where unfairness naturally ends up accumulating if it&#x27;s allowed to be secret. If you don&#x27;t know exactly how much everyone in your company is being paid, you can bet your bottom dollar that there&#x27;s some dodgy deals going on, with people being given extra raises and bonuses to make up for various issues in the organisation. And you can probably also safely assume that there&#x27;s a gender pay gap.<p>Conversely, when everyone can see exactly how much everyone else is being paid, instead of having unfairness baked into the system you have open, often heated, passionate, and engaged discussions about how to fix the system to keep it fair. This is of course impossible: fairness is in the eye of the beholder; everyone has a different definition of fairness when it comes to compensation. So it&#x27;s not possible to achieve! And so the discussion moves on to a meta level: how to be emotionally mature about this divergence of definition and design a system where everyone is happy with whatever compromises have been made around fairness.<p>Of course, this takes a lot more emotional maturity from people. It demands this of them. And so it pushes the company forwards in terms of personal growth - which is one of Bellows&#x27; stated aims and a Yesware company value.<p>I&#x27;d advise Yesware to embrace total internal transparency. It&#x27;ll be hard. It&#x27;ll be chaotic. But it&#x27;ll push you further than you can possibly get without it.<p>Here&#x27;s another example:<p>> Another transparency pitfall to look out for is the “too many cooks in the kitchen” scenario — a common problem, Bellows notes, once a company grows past five or ten people. If everyone has the same information, people begin to feel entitled to weigh in anytime, even on decisions well outside their qualifications. When that happens, keep clear boundaries.<p>Why be worried about people weighing in? It&#x27;s only from a consensus mindset that you worry about too many people weighing in. If those people are only a little bit emotionally mature they know that ultimately the decision maker will be the one making the decision and that all they&#x27;re doing is providing some input. Why does that need to feel threatening?<p>Too many cooks indicates that Yesware may have experimented with a consensus-based decision process and, quite rightly, found that it doesn&#x27;t work. There are other decision models, like the fairly well known Advice Process (which can also work in hierarchical organisations - <a href=""http://danieltenner.com/2014/11/06/the-advice-process-definition-and-usage-tips/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danieltenner.com/2014/11/06/the-advice-process-defini...</a> ) which remove this problem by making sure that each decision has exactly one cook.<p>Of course, the Advice Process is, like most important things, deceptively simple, and takes discipline and thought to implement correctly.<p>Company culture is hard. Let&#x27;s go shopping.",1445639379

People often don&#x27;t call 911 until it&#x27;s too late.<p>I do see the OP&#x27;s point that potentially education and teaching of what to actually do in these scenarios would be more effective than buying a vast number of these devices. I took a first aid course and I can say that while the majority of people <i>know</i> what the Heimlich manoeuvre is, I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;d behave properly in a chocking situation.<p>That said, I think these should <i>definitely</i> be put to trial runs to find out :)",1445637730

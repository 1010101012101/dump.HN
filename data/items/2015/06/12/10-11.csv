9705087,comment,9704764,9704895,0,0,pmontra,,,"Symbols are used all the time in Ruby (and a bunch of other languages), not as duct tape but as a very core feature of the language. Why should it be different in JavaScript?<p>The most simple way to use them is to replace definitions like this one<p><pre><code>    var north = 1;\n    var south = 2;\n    var east = 3;\n    var west = 4;\n    var direction1 = north;\n    var direction2 = south;\n    direction1 === direction2 ? &quot;ops&quot; : &quot;ok&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nThe programmer is doing the work of the interprer/compiler here and make sure to pick unique values for all the constants that are going to be compared together. With symbols that becomes<p><pre><code>    var north = new Symbol();\n    var south = new Symbol();\n    var east = new Symbol();\n    var west = new Symbol();\n    var direction1 = north;\n    var direction2 = south;\n    direction1 === direction2 ? &quot;ops&quot; : &quot;ok&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nwhich is an improvement even if it is (in a traditional JavaScript way) so much more verbose than Ruby&#x27;s<p><pre><code>    direction1 = :north\n    direction2 = :south\n    direction1 === direction2 ? &quot;ops&quot; : &quot;ok&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI just wish they&#x27;ll add some syntactical sugar to do without that &quot;new Symbol()&quot; thing and create symbols as needed like Ruby does.<p>Unfortunately, from <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Referen...</a><p><pre><code>    Symbols and JSON.stringify()\n\n    Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored when using JSON.stringify():\n\n    JSON.stringify({[Symbol(&quot;foo&quot;)]: &quot;foo&quot;});                 \n    // &#x27;{}&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re going to manually serialize them when they leave the RAM.",1434106714

Then they receive and place the votes in the urn together, and it remains sealed until the counting commences.<p>This creates a transparency that is simply not possible with an electronic solution. Even if it was possible to go through all software and hardware being deployed (A project which by itself would take years and cost millions), and the problem of being able to cast anonymous votes without the possibility of anyone finding out what you voted for was solved, you still hand over the democratic control of the election process to a small technological elite who will be doing these checks, while you gain very little from actually doing so.<p>Denmark tried to put an e-voting system in place a few years back but failed because one of the parties that was intially in favor where swayed by an angry group consisting in large part made up of computer science professionals and students.",1434106597

Too often these findings pop up in \npopular media without any backdrop or without the larger context of other \nstudies, whether with similar or dissimilar findings.<p>Here is a study that links autism to low iron intake among pregnant women:<p><pre><code>  Iron deficiency affects 40%–50% of pregnancies. Iron is critical for early \n  neurodevelopmental processes that are dysregulated in autism spectrum \n  disorder (ASD). We examined maternal iron intake in relation to ASD risk in \n  California-born children enrolled in a population-based case-control study \n  (the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) Study)\n  from 2003 to 2009 with a diagnosis of ASD (n = 520) or typical development \n  (n = 346) that was clinically confirmed using standardized assessments.\n  .\n  .\n  The highest quintile of iron intake during the index period was associated \n  with reduced ASD risk compared with the lowest (adjusted odds ratio = 0.49, \n  95% confidence interval: 0.29, 0.82), especially during breastfeeding. \n  Low iron intake significantly interacted with advanced maternal age and \n  metabolic conditions; combined exposures were associated with a 5-fold \n  increased ASD risk. Further studies of this link between maternal supplemental \n  iron and ASD are needed to inform ASD prevention strategies.[1]\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] Maternal Intake of Supplemental Iron and Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder<p><a href=""http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/09/22/aje.kwu208"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/09/22/aje.k...</a>",1434105680

In order to \ntarget the sys admin, it&#x27;s easiest if I know what their personal webmail/facebook username is so \nthat I can target it with QUANTUM. The hardest part is identifying that admin&#x27;s personal account \nto target in the first place.<p>Now, fade off with me into dream-land. Pretend that we had some master list. This master list \ncontained tons of networks around the world, and the personal accounts of admins for each of \nthose networks. And any time you wanted to target a new network, you could just find the admin \nassociated with it, queue his accounts up for QUANTUM, get access to his box and proceed to pwn \nthe network.

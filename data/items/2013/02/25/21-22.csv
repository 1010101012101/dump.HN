It would seem like it is in the interest of insurance companies for private practices to flourish given that the same thing done at a hospital costs the insurance companies 3-6 times more money.<p>Most doctors that I ask this question suggest there is a conspiracy where insurance companies are in bed with hospital. Frankly, I don't buy it. I'm probably missing something and I'd love to hear someone's take who has thought about these issues deeply as you clearly have.",1361829579

Part of that is experience, but for now, I have the impression that Tesla, with all its electronics, cannot even break even with 'normal' cars at that single measure.<p>They are working hard on refill speed and refill locations and I expect they are working hard on their battery control systems to improve remaining range estimates.

Atomicity is absolutely a different issue than a thread-safe collection. I'm publishing something new tomorrow that addresses this point.<p>To bring things back to code, the point I was originally trying to make is that this code is not thread-safe.<p><pre><code>  array = []\n  threads = []\n\n  10.times do\n    threads << Thread.new do\n      100.times { array.push(rand) }\n    end\n  end\n\n  threads.each(&:join)\n  # 10 threads each inserted 100 values, result should be 1000\n  puts array.size\n</code></pre>\nSpecifically, too many Ruby programmers won't think twice about this operation not being thread-safe:<p><pre><code>  array.push(item)\n</code></pre>\nBut there's no such guarantee.

If a company has budget for it and wants to make its employees comfortable with open space, and the employees like it, it's their business. To suggest that ""serious software engineering"" isn't occurring because of how you suppose their workspace is setup is, frankly, offensive.\nIn software engineering, most of the work goes on inside the minds of the developers. Most of the remainder goes on in a keyboard and a screen. If you wanna get down to it, having more whiteboards and less fancy computer equipment is an indicator of better problem solving, not less.\nI sit with three 19 inch monitors on my desk at work. At home, I use a 10 inch netbook most of the time. I have not seen a difference in productivity because when I am focused, I don't need screen real estate for more distractions. Everything just tunes out.\nIf you consider phd-level university computer science research as ""serious software engineering"" then I'd note that most research labs I came across in my days in academia were largely empty rooms with some tables and some work desks. Most of the students (phd students, mind you) worked on whiteboard and did coding and writing on whatever laptop they had. The workhorse machines w. big monitors were usually time-shared and dedicated to running heavy processing jobs.<p>As far as working from home goes, it seems you each agree that being comfortable with ones workspace and environment impacts productivity. That said, one is more likely to have a comfortable and productive work environment when it is up to him/her to decide what equipment to use and where, which a home office lends itself to more than an office, especially on a corporate cube-farm level. Sure, some individuals may not be as productive at a comfortable workspace in the home, but that is the individual. Working from home is not for everyone, but those who find they are more focused and productive in the home environment ought to have that choice.",1361828646

This really matters, because we use arrays, and because we use the built-in class RecordSet all over the place, doing things like rs(1) which is short for rs.Item(1).Value, and since VBScript is latebound there is no way to know what code to generate in PHP until runtime, and that's too late! The only correct thing to do in PHP would be to generate code that checks the type of a, and decides, at runtime, whether to do an array lookup or a method call. This is messy and slow and would suck big rocks in the kinds of tight loops where you tend to be using arrays.<p>How did we fix it? Well, thanks to Hungarian notation, so callously dissed by developers who do would not recognize a superb coding convention if it walked up to them on the Shanghai Maglev train and shook their pants leg, every recordset at Fog Creek starts with the letters ""rs"". And Thistle looks for the rs and say, ""ah, this is a recordset, you're not looking for an array value, you're calling the default method,"" and generates fast code. Based on your age you will either call this an evil hack (if you're young) or an elegant hack (if you're old); in either case it's a huge optimization made possible by the fact that Thistle only has one program to compile. Outside of Fog Creek it wouldn't work.

The autopsy found Platts right lung was collapsed and his chest cavity contained 1.3 liters of blood, suggesting damage to the main blood vessels of the right lung. Of his many gunshot wounds, this first was the primary injury responsible for Platts eventual death.</i>""<p>He was functional for quite some time after that, including killing the two agents who died in the shootout.  Here's some illuminating details from the end of that section:<p>""<i>[...] The bullet penetrated Platt's chest and bruised the spinal cord, ending the gunfight.<p>The shootout involved ten people: two suspects and eight FBI agents. Of the ten, only one, Special Agent Manauzzi, did not fire any shots (firearm thrown from car in initial collision), while only one, Special Agent Risner, was able to emerge from the battle without a wound. The incident lasted under five minutes yet approximately 145 shots were exchanged.<p>Toxicology tests showed that the abilities of Platt and Matix to fight through multiple traumatic gunshot wounds and continue to battle and attempt to escape were not achieved through any chemical means.

It doesn't have to be that way though.<p>For me it starts with language choices.  I suppose that if you work in VHDL all the time you probably rock.  I have an intense dislike for VHDL.  I don't see a reason to type twice as much to do the same thing.  Fifteen years ago VHDL had advantages with such constructs as ""generate"", this is no-longer the case.  I realize that this can easily turn into an argument of religious nature, so we'll have to leave it at that.<p>One approach that I have used with great success with complex modules is to write them in software first and then port to the FPGA.  Going between C and Verilog is very natural.<p>The key is to write C code keeping in mind that you are describing hardware all along.  Don't do anything that you would not be able to easily replicate on the FPGA.  You are, effectively, authoring a simulation of what you might implement in the FPGA.  The beauty of this approach is that you get the advantage of immediate execution and visualization in software.  Debug initial structures and assumptions this way to save tons of time.<p>Maybe the best way to put it is that I try not to use the FPGA HDL coding stage to experiment and create but rather to simply enter the implementation.  Then my goal is to go through as few Modelsim simulation passes as possible to verify operation.<p>If you've done non-trivial FPGA work you have probably experienced the agony of waiting an hour and a half for a design to compiler and another N hours for it to simulate before discovering problems.  The write-compile-simulate-evaluate-modify-repeat loop in FPGA work takes orders of magnitude longer than with software.  I've had projects where you can only reasonably make one to half-a-dozen code changes per 18 hour day.  That's the way it goes.<p>This is why I've resorted to extensive software-based validation before HDL coding.  I've done this with, for example, challenging custom high-performance DDR memory controllers where there was a need to fiddle with a number of parameters and be able to visualize such conditions as FIFO fill/drain levels, etc.  A nice GUI on top of the simulation made a huge difference.  The final implementation took far less time to code in HDL and worked as required from the very start.<p>Another general comment.  When it comes to image processing in FPGA's you don't really pay a penalty for modularizing your code to a relatively fine-grained degree.  This because module interfaces don't necessarily create any overhead (the best example of this being interconnect wires).  In that sense FPGA's are vastly different from software in that function or class+method interfaces generally come at a price.<p>Modularization can produce benefits during synthesis and placement.  If you can pre-place portions of your design and do your floor planning in advance you can save tons of time.  Incremental compilation has been around for a while. Still, nothing beats getting into the chip and locking down structures when it makes sense.<p>To circle back to the recurring theme of ""FPGA for the masses"" that pops-up every so often.  I maintain that FPGA's are, fundamentally, still about electrical engineering and not about software development.  These, at certain levels, become vastly different disciplines.  Once FPGA compilers become 100 to 1,000 times faster and FPGA's come with 100 to 1,000 times more resources for the money the two worlds will probably blur into one very quickly for most applications.",1361826186

It's not the cause of the under-representation of women in tech, and addressing it is unlikely to solve that issue.<p>On the one hand, the industry should make an additional effort to address the general social sexism on order to not further alienate women, but the suggestion that tech is more sexist than other areas is blatantly false, and leads to a automatic defensive response because it suggests a certain causality.<p>It is simply not very constructive to conflate the two issues, no matter how closely related they are.

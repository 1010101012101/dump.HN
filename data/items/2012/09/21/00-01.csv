4551639,comment,4551245,4551245,3,0,idanb,,,"I see this as a very welcome addition to the public stance of Kickstarter with regards to physical products (which it's been relatively quiet about).  One of the reasons we chose Kickstarter as a platform to get our product off the ground was the fact that it would allow us flexibility and freedom to get our prototypes to full scale manufacturing, which were already relatively mature in their stage of production (tooling already complete, near final hardware etc).<p>Lots of things can go wrong at every stage after you have a final production sample.  You still need to get the sample certified by a number of governing bodies, set up QC and shipping, and in the case of overseas manufacturing deal with the freight/customs and finally fulfillment of the product.<p>I'm happy that Kickstarter is taking more of stance on the subject, as we've had to in many cases provide ""returns"" to people or deal with ""customer service"" style requests, which we've done in good faith but it really misses the point of launching a product on Kickstarter.<p>I think this stance will really help back up projects when they need to make an adjustment, or have to deal with something unexpected.  Also, it should improve the quality of projects moving forward by making people more skeptical and aware of the time/cost-instability of the manufacturing process. We were lucky to hit a pretty happy medium with regards to initial volume, and unlike some of the blockbuster projects when we have to change things we don't end up on TechCrunch for it, only the Guardian :)",1348189175

One simply can't just make drastic changes back and forth, because literally, peoples lives are on the line(let alone how much financial capital is invested...) with lots of written code. I'd grab Java, C++, heck, even C over Python or Ruby, let alone god damn <i>JavaScript</i> for a project which is going to ship after approximated 5 years of development and which has planned maintenance for at least 10 years afterwards. Considering how we miss deadlines, I'd assume such a project would be maintained after 20 or 25 years. Yes, someone would still work with the code base in 2037. Imagine that, and that's not even an unrealistic stretch. Welcome to enterprise software development! Do that with Python, Ruby or JavaScript and I'll give you a cake or two.",1348189149

It's an SVG image that is built with C2[1], a ClojureScript library that provides some handy tools for working with svg.<p>After the image is done rendering, there is a callback that draws a hidden tooltip next to each of the points. The callback also puts all of the points into a kd-tree for efficient nearest neighbor searches. When a mouse hovers over the graph, the point nearest the mouse tells its tooltip to display itself.<p>Other people have made really excellent graphs using d3.js. Check out their examples if you want to be impressed: <a href=""https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery</a><p>I've also seen a lot of people using HighCharts.

Some types of products, especially hardware, can cost a lot of money to produce at a prototype stage. Not everyone has the cash lying around to spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars to build a functional prototype. So normally what that person would do is put together some renderings and a video and go to kickstarter to raise the funds to expand into prototypes and production.

Instead, the line is jagged, littered with points where large investments need to be made. For an open-ended product, you get investors, hire extra people, buy equipment, etc. You'll end up taking a short-term loss that will be earned back in the long term. For a close-ended project like Kickstarter allows, you'll have the short-term loss, but no long-term profit.<p>And that's if you have experience and connections to pull off manufacturing and courting investors.

An additional 4GB of memory is $160, even though the consumer wholesale price of such DIMMs is $20.  The cost to upgrade to a single 8GB DIMM is $450, even though the consumer wholesale price of such DIMMs is $40-50.<p>The cost to go from a 320GB 7200rpm hard disk to a 1TB 5400rpm hard disk is $170, even though the consumer wholesale price of such a disk is $110.<p>-----<p>Every OEM does this for memory and storage, because to the end user, there is an <i>obvious, measurable benefit</i>.  Twice the storage means they can store twice as many things.  Twice the memory means they can do twice as many things at once.

On Android you tend to have off-screen menu buttons and/or the Action Bar at the top.<p>Whether that's good or bad in terms of UX is a matter for debate but people get used to interacting with their platform in a certain way and it's disruptive to their user experience to suddenly find an app that doesn't follow these conventions.<p>For example, say you create an iPhone app where the menu buttons were at the top along the lines of an Action Bar you might find it creates a barrier to interacting with that app for a non-Android user.",1351860902

But I don't think that is how the term is commonly used.<p>Resolution usually means the total number of pixels in each dimension, independent of the size of those pixels. Just look at any display product spec: You'll almost always see ""Display resolution 1600x900"" (or whatever the numbers are) and almost never see ""Display resolution 123 pixels per inch"". In most cases you're left to calculate the pixels per inch on your own.<p>For lack of a better term, I've taken to using ""density"" or ""pixel density"" to refer to pixels per inch, or else just use DPI or PPI or spell it out.",1351860540

I say 'probably' because you might get hit by fees from your own bank for using an overseas ATM as well. But it's not free.<p>So you could look upon it as being offered a paid service, and IMHO it shouldn't be used without the customer being made aware of this.<p>The reason you will be asked if you'd like to pay in your currency is not really anything to do with your convenience though, it's about who gets to do the conversion and who gets to pocket the (inevitable) fees. With DCC the merchant and their (acquiring) bank get to take the fees and set the rates. Without this, your (issuing) bank does. At some point one of the acquiring banks realised that they get to see the transaction before it gets back to the issuing bank, and so they have the power to do this stuff, so DCC was born.<p>--EDIT--\nI should say it's possible, however unlikely, that DCC could turn out cheaper.

4732315,comment,4731650,4732254,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Right, and this is my fundamental issue with the software industry. If we were paid 2 or 3 times as much, we'd be assigned to do higher-impact work. The reason 90% of software engineers are assigned to bullshit is that our compensation is so <i>low</i> that it can make economic sense to put us on the sort of low-impact stuff that companies never have the sense to drop in favor of more ambitious, more interesting projects.<p>Since the 1960s, we've been approaching (but waveringly, with backward motion from 1973 to 2008) what some call the ""Singularity"", but it's actually a more prosaic shift: a movement from the late industrial era (3-6%/year economic growth) to a technological one where 10%/year (or better) growth is not out of the question. The first sign of it is what I call the <i>convexity switch</i>. The input-output curve of a worker used to be concave, with the A-players producing 120, your B's producing 110, your C's at 100, your D's at 60 and your F's (slackers) at 0. Intimidation-based management and closed allocation (which are performance-middling, bringing down the best and up the worst) made sense in a time where one slacker cancelled out 2-5 A players (relative to the C standard). But we're moving into a different era where that curve is convex: your A's produce 1000, B's produce 250, C's produce 50, and the D's and F's produce virtually nothing. The traditional, mediocrity-oriented management model used by MBA programs, McKinsey, and typical software management doesn't work anymore, and no one (except, perhaps, the leaders of Valve and Github) has any clue what to do.<p>The issue for us is the expectancy-variance trade-off. The effect of ""lean"" management post-1975 was to make individual managers (and workers) more accountable for local performance, the result being that no one was paying attention to global, company-wide concerns. Everyone started becoming a lot more careerist, job tenures decreased, et cetera. People optimized for local performance and especially for low variance, because underperformance is punished more severely (firing) than high performance is rewarded (usually, small bonuses, if the high performance is noticed at all). Bosses no longer worked for ""the company"" or were rewarded for abstract contributions that make the whole firm a better place, but instead were measured by <i>their</i> bosses, and on a tight timeframe. It became more about ""individual accountability"" and less about actual value creation. The results favor low-variance work. In a concave world, this actually works very well, because low variance is observed at the top of the output curve. This means the work is reliable and meets expectations, and the interchangeable parts fit together well with no surprises. But in a convex world, the top of the output curve is more <i>highly</i> variable, so the result of low-variance management strategies is abysmally low bulk output. It doesn't <i>look</i> abysmally low-- software engineers are still contributing $200-400k per year of business value-- but it's terrible in comparison to what would be possible if the allowance for variance were higher.",1351860000

It is actually still worse to be a victim of sexism than to be called a sexist.<p>2) Having core sexist beliefs isn't a prerequisite for making a sexist comment. You can have a momentary sexist thought without consciously believing that women are inferior to men or anything like that - in fact, momentary sexist thoughts are almost inevitable if you're in a culture where sexism is pervasive, no matter who you are. Moreover, a comment can be sexist even if it is made with completely innocent intentions, if it predictably has the effect of (re)enforcing hierarchical gender roles. Sexism is not an ideology, it's a social structure.<p>You can do ""s/sexism/racism/g"" for all of the above as well.",1351858983

I assure you reality doesn't fully match your theory.</i><p>I'm talking about social status and ""coolness"" which are not identical to sexual ""market value"". In fact, I think it's a bad idea for women to exploit any <i>sexual</i> ""assets"", because a woman who is visibly trying to do so won't be taken seriously. I'm talking about a more general-purpose social asset which is that an attractive woman is judged to be ""cool"" (even by gay men).<p>The initial conditions of social status are set by people wanting things, in the aggregate, so the heterosexual 93% have disproportionate influence. The final conditions are set algorithmically by something that looks like PageRank: people care about popular peoples' opinions because other people care about popular peoples' opinions.<p>This isn't about what's right or how things should be. It's about what is.<p><i>(b) It's just an ""attractive female"" advantage, ""attractive men"" have been found to have similar advantages.</i><p>True, but the ages in which people are most attractive are 18-29. Men in that age range have low social status (theirs starts out very low, but increases into the 40s and 50s) while women at that age have high social status (and it declines with age). Again, I'm not saying this is how things should be, but it's what is.<p>The result is that women reach their maximum attractiveness at a time of high social status, while men reach maximum attractiveness at an age when society still considers most of them to be unproven losers who jack off and play videogames all day. People tend to become more average in looks as they get older, and by the age of peak social status for men, almost all of them are in the ""average"" range where attractiveness doesn't have a major push.<p>A woman doesn't have to be highly attractive to take advantage of this, by the way. She has to be seen as preternaturally cool. There are women of average or below-average looks who can pull this off.",1351858912

The reality of successful science is on neither of these extremes, of course.<p>And by the way I do think that judging human performance by simple metrics is problematic, but not because it's statistics or not 'high-level', simply because it doesn't take enough information into account; it's a shortcut to the actual concept of quality, which is dangerous when metrics are used in decision-making.

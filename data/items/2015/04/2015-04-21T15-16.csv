You can force buyers to agree to a license agreement to legally read your book. The right to first sale applies to copyright and trademark - it does not allow you to ignore license agreements. Obviously it&#x27;s easier to enforce on software because you can execute DRM code on a device.<p>Blaming this on software or computers misses the underlying mechanism and focuses on the wrong thing. It is, and always has been, an issue of what we allow and don&#x27;t allow in our legal system.<p>It will stop when people want it to stop.",1429631987

These vehicles need to be operational when they&#x27;re called upon, every minute of downtime costs a substantial amount of money that adds up incredibly fast. Sure, they have service contracts but waiting on a technician and waiting even longer for a replacement part is out of the question. A broken sensor will disable a tractor even if it would run perfectly fine without it. Mega farms care about losing the ability to improvise repairs in the field and/or take the risk of long term damage if its outweighed by the cost of the short term downtime.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced the results of an ECU that can disable a perfectly functional vehicle. I had a ride day with one of our service technicians in our Class 7 truck. The &quot;Check Engine&quot; light had been coming on intermittently throughout the day but we ignored it as it came on inconsistently and we were already 2 hours behind. On our way back to our branch the light came on again at highway speed and 30 seconds later the engine went into &quot;limp home&quot; mode and then shut itself off. We came to a rest on the side of the highway, tilted slightly into a ditch. After calling the local service manager we were informed that the head gasket had blown and the last technician to drive the truck was supposed to refill the coolant and let us know about the issue. We hiked down the road with the empty coolant bottles the last tech left for us and brought back 20 gallons of water, filling the expansion tank. So we should be good as long as we kept tabs on the water level, right? Nope. The water level sensor was placed in in a position where we couldn&#x27;t fill the tank high enough for it to read the tank as full due to the angle of the truck in the ditch. It wouldn&#x27;t start without a &quot;safe&quot; reading from the sensor and we couldn&#x27;t level the truck out without it&#x27;s own power. That sensor left us stranded for 3 hours until a repair truck arrived and had us running in less than 10 minutes by jacking up the low side of the truck. Now imagine losing half a day during harvest for the same bullshit reason.",1429631458

The prevailing trend if you look at a another centuries worth of data is different:<p>In the 18th and 19th centuries western European society was highly unequal. Private wealth dwarfed national income and was concentrated in the hands of the rich families who sat atop a relatively rigid class structure. This system persisted even as industrialisation slowly contributed to rising wages for workers. Only the chaos of the first and second world wars and the Depression disrupted this pattern. High taxes, inflation, bankruptcies, and the growth of sprawling welfare states caused wealth to shrink dramatically, and ushered in a period in which both income and wealth were distributed in relatively egalitarian fashion. But the shocks of the early 20th century have faded and wealth is now reasserting itself.<p>As a general rule wealth grows faster than economic output, or in other terms: r > g (where r is the rate of return to wealth and g is the economic growth rate). Other things being equal, faster economic growth will diminish the importance of wealth in a society, whereas slower growth will increase it (and demographic change that slows global growth will make capital more dominant). But there are no natural forces pushing against the steady concentration of wealth. Only a burst of rapid growth (from technological progress or rising population) or government intervention can be counted on to keep economies from returning to the “patrimonial capitalism” that worried Karl Marx. Governments should step in now, by adopting a global tax on wealth, to prevent soaring inequality contributing to economic or political instability down the road.<p>In simple terms, rich peoples&#x27; invested wealth grows faster then poor peoples&#x27; wealth due to compounding interest. This is the true reason for the wealth gap AND this is the prevailing economic theory of wealth inequality among academia.",1429631439

(Why are those important?  Because they enable people with special needs / mental illness to function in &quot;normal&quot; situations.)<p>* Uber drivers don&#x27;t want animals in their personal cars, got it.  But it&#x27;s a choice to be an Uber driver, not a choice to be disabled or need an emotional support animal.  When we think about this, we should think about who has the choice here.<p>There&#x27;s an easy fix.<p>Default every Uber drive to accept all animals.  Allow the Uber drivers to opt out, and in so doing lower their rank in search and have a badge next to their name, &quot;Restrictions Apply&quot; or something along those lines.  Let their customers choose if they want to give money to people who are discriminatory.  People with the disabilities shouldn&#x27;t be forced to check a box or ask for special assistance, that&#x27;s why you would default all drivers to accept pets and explain why it&#x27;s important.  Being able to provide a service to all users is important, but for fringe groups there isn&#x27;t always an economic drive to do so.  Like providing a seat belt, training with how to handle service animals should be mandatory.  (The one driver put a service dog in the trunk?!  Please tell me he isn&#x27;t working at Uber any more.)<p>Personal note:  Ever tried to take a kid who has special needs to see the Grand Canyon?  What started out as a dream trip was soured by people in hotels making a huge stink about Emotional Support Dogs, and reminding us at every turn that we had a special needs kid with us.  People could have been kind, they could have pulled us aside, or read the notes from their boss that we were coming... but every time we hit a new hotel people would inevitably yell at my cousin, who has DS, because he would bring his dog with him to the lobby or near the pool, or even on a trail.  &quot;No pets allowed!&quot;  Even though we called ahead, the staff on the ground wasn&#x27;t trained to deal with service animals.  Without his dog, the world was a scary place form my cousin; Emotional Support Dogs are like hearing aids or canes or a pair of glasses that way.<p>Anyway if you see someone who has a dog in a place you wouldn&#x27;t normally expect to see a dog, please assume they have a good reason for it.

Let me spell this out as clearly as possible:<p><i>I know that you don&#x27;t care about the number of extremists as a percentage of the total population. I never thought that you did. Neither of us does. Ok?</i><p>You&#x27;re still avoiding the main issue. Are most Middle Eastern countries producing an unusually high number of extremists? You can&#x27;t show that they are by showing that they produce <i>some</i> extremists. But that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve done so far.<p>In other words, what distinguishes most Middle Eastern countries, in your mind, from e.g. Britain, France and the USA? All of these countries produce <i>some</i> Islamic extremists. So clearly, if you&#x27;re going to say that there&#x27;s something special about Middle Eastern countries in this regard, you&#x27;re going to have to crunch the numbers. I don&#x27;t see any numbers in any of your posts so far.<p>Again, none of this has anything to do with the number of extremists in comparison to the total population. The question is whether the number of extremists is significantly larger than the number produced by non-Middle-Eastern countries. In other words, when you said &quot;so many&quot; in your original post, were you correct to imply that the number is generally higher in the Middle East than elsewhere?",1429631138

Until then if you wanted to pay people less money you had to somehow literally cut their pay.  You had to make them accept a smaller number on their paycheck.<p>After that, through the miracle of inflation, the numbers on their paychecks could continue to go up, up up!  Just as long as those numbers are going up more slowly than inflation, you as a business owner are giving people a pay cut and they&#x27;re not noticing it.

I get a much better idea of how many duplicates or variants of an item are in the collection now.<p>However, I think it does a much worse job navigating to finding things you already know are there, but maybe don&#x27;t quite know the name of. It&#x27;s <i>almost</i> impossible to navigate to something if you just have partial knowledge of it, or generally know where it is in the archive but don&#x27;t have specifics. I find this super frustrating.<p>I love archive.org more than just about anything else on the internet, and I&#x27;m willing to be patient with the new design as they flesh out the ideas. If they can fix the navigation issue I&#x27;d be relatively happy.<p>I think what archive.org needs more than this redesign is an organizational meta-layer on-top of the archive where volunteer &quot;curators&quot; can organize content spread all over the archive (or siloed under some random collection somewhere) into more familiar, library-like organizational structure.<p>For example, I like old computing magazines. However, archive.org doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;magazines&quot; top-level hierarchy. If you search for &quot;magazines&quot; over on the right side-bar there&#x27;s a &quot;Magazine Rack&quot; Collection, but it&#x27;s not prominently places. And then the layer under that is a mishmash of &quot;Collections&quot; that include magazine genres, individual titles, etc. but no clear &quot;computer magazine&quot; collection. I poked around for a few minutes and still didn&#x27;t find the collection for old computing magazines.<p>So I did another search for &quot;computer magazines&quot; and finally there&#x27;s a collection of &quot;Computer Magazine Archives&quot;.<p>However, this is probably incomplete, there&#x27;s bound to be other magazines that are not part of this collection.<p>It&#x27;d be much easier if I could go<p>Texts/Magazines/Computers<p>and everything would be there by title, maybe set a filter for &quot;English&quot; or something and be off reading<p>But right now it&#x27;s takes a dozen navigation clicks and a few searches to find the same, once you find a collection you end up bookmarking it in your browser because you&#x27;ll probably forget the magic combination of searches and clicks that got you here.<p>It&#x27;s tough though, they&#x27;re doing an immense job with relatively few resources to organize everything.

It&#x27;s requires a huge leap of logic to say that computers are the cause... after all correlation does not imply causation. You need significantly more evidence to prove that computers are the cause of the growing wage gap.<p>There was a really famous book that was published recently called &quot;Capital in the 21st century&quot; by Thomas Piketty that summarizes the real reason:<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/05/economist-explains"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/05/ec...</a><p>The book is dense, but the logic and evidence is compelling. Basically it says that you need to look at more data, because there was ALWAYS a trend towards inequality that was temporarily reversed from 1930-1975, read below:<p>&quot;&quot;Capital&quot; is built on more than a decade of research by Mr Piketty and a handful of other economists, detailing historical changes in the concentration of income and wealth. This pile of data allows Mr Piketty to sketch out the evolution of inequality since the beginning of the industrial revolution. In the 18th and 19th centuries western European society was highly unequal. Private wealth dwarfed national income and was concentrated in the hands of the rich families who sat atop a relatively rigid class structure. This system persisted even as industrialisation slowly contributed to rising wages for workers. Only the chaos of the first and second world wars and the Depression disrupted this pattern. High taxes, inflation, bankruptcies, and the growth of sprawling welfare states caused wealth to shrink dramatically, and ushered in a period in which both income and wealth were distributed in relatively egalitarian fashion. But the shocks of the early 20th century have faded and wealth is now reasserting itself. On many measures, Mr Piketty reckons, the importance of wealth in modern economies is approaching levels last seen before the first world war.&quot;<p>The real reason for economic inequality is not technology, it is actually a feature of capitalism. In simple terms what is happening is that invested wealth grows faster for rich people then it does for poor people and this causes the gap to grow. See the quote below:<p>&quot;From this history, Mr Piketty derives a grand theory of capital and inequality. As a general rule wealth grows faster than economic output, he explains, a concept he captures in the expression r > g (where r is the rate of return to wealth and g is the economic growth rate). Other things being equal, faster economic growth will diminish the importance of wealth in a society, whereas slower growth will increase it (and demographic change that slows global growth will make capital more dominant). But there are no natural forces pushing against the steady concentration of wealth. Only a burst of rapid growth (from technological progress or rising population) or government intervention can be counted on to keep economies from returning to the “patrimonial capitalism” that worried Karl Marx. Mr Piketty closes the book by recommending that governments step in now, by adopting a global tax on wealth, to prevent soaring inequality contributing to economic or political instability down the road.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m no economist but according to my knowledge this is the prevailing theory in academia today.",1429630085

Income is not the only measure of wealth, I don&#x27;t even consider it the most important.<p>I was hanging out at the bar the other day with this software developer from India. He had brought a puppy with him to the bar. While I was playing with the puppy and we were chatting, a girl comes up to us and wants to play with the puppy too.<p>His intentions became nakedly known when he kept saying over and over that &quot;me and the puppy are a package deal.&quot; As I was leaving to head to the restroom, he starts going on about how he&#x27;s &quot;recruiting&quot; for a boat trip in the Caribbean. When I got back she was gone, obviously unimpressed.<p>It got me thinking about the dating market. No woman I know has wealth anywhere on their priority list for men they want to date. That guy could have been telling the complete truth about yachting in the Caribbean and she&#x27;d have had the same reaction. Who wants to spend time with a boor even on a luxury yacht?<p>If he&#x27;d been legit Mr. Darcy, sure, I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;d have been eating out of his hand.<p>--------------------------------<p>If I wanted to, I could fairly easily jack up my yearly salary by anywhere from $25-50K by finding another job. The reason I haven&#x27;t done that yet is simply that the switching costs vastly dwarf the (slight) standard of living increase that the bump would afford me. When I look to move the needle, salary just doesn&#x27;t look attractive. Just having one is the big win.<p>I hold that money is cheap right now precisely because capital is worth much less, relative to other kinds of wealth. Who is killing it right now? Apple. Samsung. Global commercial institutions. Finance has accomplished its goal of making everything fungible, now the only things left that are worth anything relative to anything else are precisely the things that finance can&#x27;t replicate, like an amazing company started by an amazing genius.<p>So, no, capital accumulation is not worrying to me, because it&#x27;s obvious to me that we live in a much richer world now than we ever have. Doesn&#x27;t look that way on paper, but that&#x27;s because we don&#x27;t have a way of representing, in the numbers, the idea that money itself isn&#x27;t worth what it used to be. Capital accumulation is exactly what would happen if everyone started subconsciously realizing that cash is no longer king.

Despite that, it took me 16 hours door-to-door for an 11 hour flight. So even with a plane trip that long, about 1/3 of the total travel time was on the ground.<p>Of course that depends on your distance to the airport, but there train stations very often have a solid advantage. E.g. going from where I live in London to anywhere I&#x27;d like to actually go to in Paris via the Eurostar is faster because the train terminals on both ends are more conveniently located.<p>So the answer is &quot;it depends&quot; but unless you live much closer to the airport than the relevant train terminal it generally takes a quite long flight before air travel is faster. Even then, I will often prefer train if it is &quot;only&quot; a bit slower, because of perceived convenience and comfort (e.g. I&#x27;d easily pick one hour more on a train vs. 30 minutes shorter journey if the latter involves additional legs, such as getting off a plane and lugging my bags to a train or bus station to get in to town).",1429629690

I think Uber (and also car-sharing services like Zipcar) are great for transit advocates, because they make it much easier for city dwellers to justify not owning a car, to the extent that I suspect that they actually increase transit usage.<p>Many people in my city (Washington, DC) that own cars don&#x27;t actually need them most days, but they do have occasional needs that aren&#x27;t easily doable by transit (Costco trips, driving out to see friends in the less-transit-friendly suburbs, hiking in Shenandoah, etc.) so they keep a car for that purpose. But the problem there is the incentives; the fixed costs of car ownership (a car payment, insurance, scheduled maintenance, etc.) are high, and once you&#x27;ve paid them, the incremental cost per mile of travel is really low (certainly way lower than the per-mile cost of transit), so if you have a car, you have a strong incentive to use it more than you need to.

If anything they&#x27;ve been trying for a long time to put up &quot;cyber borders&quot; but policymakers have blown it off as unnecessary when it&#x27;s just a matter of cyber crime.<p>Now that Snowden has opened up peoples eyes to the possibilities (quite forcefully, I might add), there is now political cover to build those cyber walls, only under the guise of &quot;blocking the NSA&quot; instead of blocking Chinese hackers.<p>You&#x27;re right that this has been obvious too.

Yes, computing a salted hash is CPU expensive, as it should be, and I&#x27;m not going to make it easier to DDOS me. I have a whole bunch of higher priority items. Password salt verification is at the bottom of the list.<p>3) There is no incentive to use your service. I completely feel your pain there. You need a lot of users to know your service for third parties to register and use your brand. And you need these third parties to help your brand be known to the end users. Which come first ? The egg of the chicken ? I am sorry but I am not going to be the chicken...<p>4) I&#x27;m not going to tell the world how many iterations are used to generate hash based on my XXXbits key. Good security is only through transparency but there is no need to tell the number of hashing iterations. Users don&#x27;t care. I just make sure it&#x27;s as high as my hardware allows vs user&#x27;s response time.<p>5) any website can lie to your service and be &#x27;verified&#x27; as secure.<p>6) even if your service was worth it, there are many attack vectors that I am more worried about than just the password hashing. Password hashing is a no brainer if the standard solutions are implemented. Other stuff in-memory protection (make sure a plain text password is not in your redis), SSL, etc. are a bit more complicated.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m not just buying the idea. I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of things that could be done to help people be better at security. Keep improving !",1394487979

So under that scenario you need a visa and sponsorship by an employer. There is a new system called PEP which does not require sponsorship by the employer, but has additional requirements in terms of base salary and restrictions on employment, but again it still counts as requiring a visa.<p>So having &quot;just an American passport&quot; does not allow you work in a country like Singapore without applying for a visa.

However in Ruby the only capable library supporting concurrent HTTP requests that I liked was Typhoeus.

Either we are all subject to mass surveillance by various unknown state actors, or we can all push back against it <i>for everyone</i>, and restore the original purpose of our intel agencies - to protect the people in the countries they work for from attacks (both on life and information), a purpose which they have subverted and betrayed by becoming the agents of attack themselves, undermining crypto standards etc.<p>Privacy rights, like human rights, should not depend on the country you come from or where you happen to be, and I agree with his position that targeted surveillance is acceptable in some circumstances, but mass surveillance is not, whoever is doing it; it&#x27;s just too dangerous.",1394485473

Very few sites include stripe.js in the source on the front page. So you would need to crawl deep enough into a site to hit the checkout page and capture stripe.js in the head section which is exponentially more difficult.<p>Indexing your crawl and passing this off to a team to extract contact details and send it to a client so they can reach out all within 40 minutes I would say is nearly impossible. It is possible they already had his details but I cannot see anything on his site that would trigger a &quot;likely to switch payment gateways&quot; alert.<p>My guess is this was completely random. A good sales rep will make 60-100 outbound calls per day along with a bunch of emails. Multiply this by the number of outbound sales reps in the payments market and you have a lot of sales activity.",1394485313

7375674,comment,,7374277,4,0,anon24892,,,"I very much disagree, in the general case. The complexity of embedded systems design can&#x27;t be significantly reduced by using python and I often do not think while developing that I higher level language would help, in fact I often think that C maps <i>very</i> well to the problem. It was designed as a system programming language and is good as one.<p>The complexity of embedded code does not lie in the code itself but in the hardware and you have sacraficed a few orders of magnitude in speed for very little or no gain. The code itself is usually fairly simple but you would not be able to tell anything from looking at it, you need to refer to datasheets.<p>Not only this but by using an more expensive ECU to begin with you really limit the scalability of your design and add to recurring costs.<p>I use a more powerful microcontroller at work and we still constantly have to drop down to assembly, albeit in limited controlled ways.<p>That said, there will be areas where this is a viable option, but not many. You have to analyze your problem and decide if is viable; for an embedded webserver it is, for a DCDC converter where speed is of a concern it is not. For a smoke alarm where cost is primarily a factor and your margins are tiny it is not.",1394485291

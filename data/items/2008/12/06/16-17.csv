You can drop a note to an acquisitions editor to see if any authors have refused their right to revise.<p>Even if you lose money writing a book (you probably will--that's why editors rarely quit to become authors), you can still impress at contractor interviews by showing up with your published book. Or use the book to raise your speaking fees, etc.",1228582500

388181,comment,387950,388129,0,0,smanek,,,"I don't get why people so want to abstract around Javascript itself - it's a great language. It supports OOP and functional programming (although, admittedly, the prototype object system does take some getting used to) and it's dynamically typed. You even get a REPL! (e.g., via firebug). I would argue the js is far better than Objective-C and Java, and at least on par with python.<p>Now, some of the DOM manipulation stuff is just annoying, but that's what jQuery is for :-D<p>What do you like better about Java's object system than JS's? I prefer JS's because it isn't as constraining - it doesn't force you to use it the way its creators imagined. It's possible to write good JS code, it just takes some self-constraint.",1228582176

388179,comment,387921,388056,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I take a medium-strong form of S-W. It makes sense in the connectionist model (which I also take a medium-strong interpretation).<p>The strongest form says that concepts in one language are completely alien to another, such that if you don't know the concepts in one language, you cannot perceive them. This is obviously false.<p>However, as related concepts are evoked by spread-activation, it is completely plausible that one language allows more efficient retrieval of certain concepts, such that very strong biases result.<p>The famous example of the many Inuit words for snow comes to mind. It is true that a non-Inuit speaker is able to discern between different kinds of snow, but the language guides the mind in terms of where to look for details. Without this guide, it is easy to get lost and confused.<p>Here's the familiar example for hackers: code in C/Basic/Pascal for a while, and switch to Python/Ruby (or vice versa). After you get used to the target language, and look back at the code right after the switch, you'll notice that a lot of programming constructs are out-of-place and ""counterintuitive."" This is, so to speak, Sapir-Whorf ""at work.""<p>This is also why when LISPers say that you should learn lisp, because it will make you a better programmer, they are correct. :)",1228582107

The OS has no involvement in the user agent string. Most browsers happen to include an OS, but that is their choice, and they are free to lie.<p>My guess is that either Google has a critical mass of privacy nuts that use readily-available Firefox extensions that do this, or, probably more likely, that there are internal builds of Chrome floating around that have been programmed not to send their version number freely out. It means... nothing interesting whatsoever!<p>Speculation that Google was building a browser was obvious and flowed freely long before it was found to be true. Speculation that they are building an OS is the same, except it hasn't been shown to be true yet. Well, except the Android OS, which I'm sure there are NO PLANS WHATSOEVER to bring to the desktop in any form, ever. (I mean, obviously it can't be a straight translation, but...)",1228581713

Names for objects often come out in Danish if I don't stop and translate them into English.<p>In college I had some unfortunate partners on a programming project who were subjected to code written late at night and very quickly with comments in both English and German and with many Danish identifiers. Fortunately they were up to the task, and as they were Italian and Norwegian with English as a second language, they gave as good as they got with the multi-lingual coding.<p>Our professor requested a full English translation to accompany our source when we turned it in.",1228581668

I can ""feel"" its meanings, almost in the sense that the meaning flows through my fingertips, but I don't experience imagery or episodes or sounds.<p>Similarly, when I need to use an abstract word, I translate these feelings into words.

As a proponent of small government, the ideas themselves are echoes, but I appreciate the wealth of evidence provided.<p>The big governments of the past sixteen (or, arguably, eighty) years have provided quite a bit of ammunition for political conservatives, and this spiraling crisis to me resembles an endgame for big government. Its bloat and poor decisions will result in bankruptcy and a timely education for those who've forgotten that  the US government is inherently inefficient. This inefficiency is by design, for fear of a hulking administration was the primary motive in drafting such a constitution.<p>Or, this will become a runaway train, and the government will grow like a cancer til its collapse.

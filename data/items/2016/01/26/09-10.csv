Who will always &quot;compelled to renew their catalogue&quot;, of course.

If you are concerned about investing the time in an entire lecture, check out the video &quot;Dragons, Divine Parents, Heroes and Adversaries: A complete cosmology of being&quot; [3]; it gives a high level overview of the content contained within his lectures. I believe &#x27;Personality and its Transformations&#x27; (2014 series) followed by &#x27;Maps of Meaning&#x27; (2015) to be the best approach, though I haven&#x27;t yet had a chance to listen to the 2016 releases.<p>Jordan has uncanny ability to piece together observations on human behavior with science and mythology; expounding humanity&#x27;s nuances, ticks and everyday common behavior  through the lens of ancient mythology, evolution and ideas and theories by notable psychologists and philosophers.<p>Keep an open mind while listening, but also be prepared to think critically about many of his assumptions and assertions as Jordan takes a number of &#x27;educated&#x27; leaps (and demands you follow) in regards to published studies and what they may infer, but the leaps are never illogical - just yet to be soundly proven.<p>Overall, listening to these lectures truly was a transformative experience for myself.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10941363"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10941363</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos</a>\n[3]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqONu6wDYaE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqONu6wDYaE</a><p>edit: linked this story and not the previous one.",1453800934

Every last little thing that isn&#x27;t a primitive type is a pointer. Everywhere, in every bit of code.<p>That means a &quot;new Object()&quot; takes up 16 bytes (8 bytes for the object, 8 for the pointer to it). That means you fill a cache line by allocating 4 objects, or 2 objects containing a single reference, or ...<p>So in java you should never program a line drawing loop by using 2 vectors, because 2 vectors, each with 2 32-bit ints take up 8<i>2 (2 pointers to the objects you&#x27;re using) + 8</i>2 (overhead for the objects) + 4*2 (the actual data) 40 bytes of data. No way you can fit that in registers and still use registers to actually calculate things. So instead you should use 4 ints and just forget about the objects, and even that will only work if you never call any functions.<p>Same loop in C/C++/Pascal/Go/... using structs takes 8 bytes (they don&#x27;t keep structs on the heap), which, if necessary, fits in 1 register (granted, in practice we&#x27;re talking 2 registers, but still).<p>People might reply to this with benchmarks, but if you actually analyse the java code where java beats or is comparable with C/C++ you&#x27;re going to see zero object allocations. You&#x27;re not even going to see them using bool in the extreme cases, rather they&#x27;ll bitshift into ints to effectively generate packed bools (certainly in SAT benchmarks). This is not realistic java code, which would have been way slower.<p>Java&#x27;s memory model is the main culprit at this point in time. Java can do incredible tricks with programs, and actually exposes them, enabling lots of language creativity on the JVM. But there&#x27;s a pretty sizeable cost in speed and memory usage.",1453800824

Ideally, some of those checks should have been outside the area affected by software updates, such as in hardware.<p>As software moves into more and more areas that are traditionally thought of as hardware developers need to realize that in some areas bugs are <i>not</i> acceptable.

In that case, immigration opponents can&#x27;t claim that nobody takes their concerns seriously, or that you&#x27;re not allowed to criticize mass immigration, because many mainstream outlets and figures are doing so. But the media support seems to if anything just help their cause: years of Fox News harshly criticizing illegal immigration from Mexico feeds well into Trump&#x27;s strategy of doing the same thing, but with the rhetoric amped up a few notches.",1453799251

People have to start caring how the money they&#x27;re accepting has flowed through the economy.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how this is &quot;easy&quot;. Money doesn&#x27;t become evil because of how it was earned, that&#x27;s just an overly emotional way of looking at a system of transactions.<p>> Money is power. Anonymous money prevents you from choosing which power you&#x27;d like to submit to. Decentralized money prevents governments from restricting power. Let&#x27;s keep the decentralization and remove the anonymity so you can reject power you find undesirable.<p>That&#x27;s ridiculous FUD. Consider people donating to WikiLeaks or similar, where the sender might not want a record of where they sent their money. If the source of the money is anonymous, there&#x27;s no &quot;power&quot; involved.

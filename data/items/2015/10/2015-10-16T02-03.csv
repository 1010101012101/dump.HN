I think it much more probable to look at GBI as separating the monopolistic part of the work market (if I don&#x27;t work I will starve) from the competitive portion. Surely more competition in the employment market is a good thing?<p>Even then, I still think it is the third order effects of GBI (the ones we don&#x27;t know about, or are to complex to model) that are most likely to cause massive societal upheaval.

What I wonder most about is: what is the relationship between the poverty and the prosperity?  Are the people in the &quot;labour camp&quot; able to go out and shop for meat, fruits, and barber services?  Can they go get another job?  Or are they in some kind of debt bondage?  Have they been forced out of their homes by the electronics industries, or are they sending money to their parents and grandparents back in the village?  Are the street food vendors and desperate taxi drivers better off than they were before the electronics industry came along, or are they finding themselves unable to pay the escalating bribes and taxes, forced off the land their families farmed, and occasionally beat up by police for scaring rich teenagers?  What was their life like five or ten years ago, and what do they expect it to be like five or ten years from now?  Can they walk to the KFC, or will the police pick them up as if they were Maciej Ceglowski walking around in the wrong neighborhood <a href=""http://www.idlewords.com/2006/08/i_spy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.idlewords.com/2006/08/i_spy.htm</a> or a black person walking around in a white neighborhood in the US?<p>Why is there only trash on the poor street?  Do people not throw trash on the ground on the rich street, or is there a municipal street sweeping service that takes care of that?  If so, why doesn&#x27;t it clean the poor street?  What&#x27;s up with the lack of safety equipment?

I work in a relatively modern office building and live in a not-totally-crap hotel. I travel to work via taxis which seem to be staffed by poor people trying to make a living. Forget about Uber here.<p>When I get out of the hotel, I can turn left and find myself next to KFC, Starbucks and a big shopping mall full of expensive-looking clothes. Everything is plastered with ads like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. Or I can turn right and find myself on a poor street that is flooded with trash and occupied by tons of people selling absolutely everything - meat, fruits, phones, barber services. Those people look impoverished and from what I can tell, pretty much sit there 24h/day 7 days a week trying to sell something to someone. They are all incredibly friendly, but you can feel the lack of perspective for a better life; it&#x27;s heartbreaking. There&#x27;s a family of street food vendors making fried pasta with various meats; a father, a mother and a son. I&#x27;m buying food from them pretty much every day. They&#x27;re extremely proficient at what they do (and they use up scary amounts of propane for that), but you can see that they&#x27;ll be doing it for the rest of their lives.<p>There&#x27;s a big construction zone next to a metro station nearby. They&#x27;ll probably be building skyscrapers, like a lot of others that are currently in progress. The zone is fenced off with 2m high concrete walls. I managed to take a look through a crack, and what I saw was something akin to a labour camp. Some metal sheds, minimum sanitation, lots of people cramped together. I&#x27;ve been told they&#x27;re workers from local villages. They looked hungry and impoverished. They don&#x27;t seem to have any safety equipment.<p>There&#x27;s a fucking Starbucks and a KFC and lots of people with smartphones few hundred meters downstreet. And a modern, high-tech metro station on the other side of the wall.<p>Then there are electronics markets. Tons of fancy stuff. Everything you could imagine. Sold by people cramped together in small spaces that look like they couldn&#x27;t afford what they&#x27;re selling. Basically third world selling first-world products.<p>It&#x27;s really unnerving that you can have a place that is so amazing and yet so sad at the same time, with nothing but an occasional concrete wall separating the two pictures.",1444962865

A few weeks ago, Paper finally added support for folders, which while still a bit clunky/not-ideal (the sidebar doesn&#x27;t give you a tree nav, there&#x27;s no way to see the whole structure), it at least meets that minimum bar for organizing say, more than 20 notes.<p>I haven&#x27;t done much group collaboration work (the teams/org stuff was just introduced, and honestly, the thought of Dropbox completely messing up my/my coworkers personal Dropbox accounts terrifies me - the horror stories posted in the thread don&#x27;t help assuage my fears, and I am not sure I have a conceptual understanding/trust of how Dropbox models accounts/teams), and while Folders have permissions, I can&#x27;t figure out how to assign/inherit permissions (crucial for working with clients, contractors), but on the bright side, it&#x27;s not literally insane like Google Sites&#x27; permission system (it involves modifying global inheritances to give access to specific sub-trees).<p>In most other ways, it is like Hackpad++ - mostly like you would have expected it to evolve: great feeling typeahead search, instant editing, OT-based multi-user editing, and improved/extended embeds, and adds annotations, which I can see being conceptually pretty useful.<p>The biggest thing missing for me now is offline editing - it&#x27;s not strictly a requirement for our office use, since that&#x27;s online-only as well, but there are so many times traveling/offsite where it&#x27;s a huge pain.

It means there is no central authority with the capacity to use one or another variety of force to enforce their decisions. If a dozen people with no enforceable authority over each other look at a problem, discuss amongst themselves (even if there is an informal, unenforced hierarchy), come to similar conclusions, and agree to take coordinated action with no enforcement, it&#x27;s still a decentralized decision.<p>There was no central authority here. Not even BTC Guild, because nobody had the power to force them to do what they did. They did it for their own reasons.<p>This is not a demonstration of how centralization saved the day; this is a demonstration that the decentralized BitCoin network still responded rapidly and solved a major problem, without having to fall back to some sort of centralization.<p>Decentralized networks still develop structure, usually with some sort of power law appearing. They just don&#x27;t form one single central node that defines the very network, upon which the network lives or dies, and the dominant nodes can and often do shift and flow over time. BitCoin has been repeatedly resilient against even very large nodes in their graph dying.<p>(And I say this as a repeated and continuing BitCoin skeptic, not a cheerleader. This sort of decentralized rapid response isn&#x27;t even particularly unusual; the Internet itself faces this sort of crisis fairly routinely and solves the problems without a single centralized authority dictating solutions to everybody else. &quot;Rough consensus and running code&quot; is another similarly-decentralized credo that has built a lot of things.)",1444962085

Her idea is that since I have 2 years of ancient Hebrew and 2 years of Greek and even taught 2nd year Greek in college that I have answers. I would read anywhere between 5,000 to 20,000 pages per class in seminary, that would be around 400-500 pages a week minimum.

I hold to the idea that if God was to be provable He would have made  Himself a concrete object. This came from reading a lot of Soren Kierkegaard and in fact I named my son Soren after him. Kierkegaard came up with the &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; well after studying that the popular belief in that is wrong. It is a leap of despair and dread into the unknown and land upon faith.

That is, people tend to have children when it makes sense for them. Leaving aside the ""third world"" (I think they might have different reasons), that means they tend to have children when they have jobs and therefore enough money to take care of the children.<p>Then there is a certain likelihood that the same kind of jobs they had are also available for their children. It happens now and then that entire industries break away, leaving millions of people jobless, but on average it seems to work out.<p>That doesn't imply it will continue to work like that in the future, though.

It's a different take on logic programming based on the idea of automatically transforming your problem into a SAT-like representation and then running fancy conflict-driven constraint learning solvers on it.

3097631,story,,,1,0,zhang818,"Silk wallpaper",http://www.flickr.com/photos/jameitecom/,"History of Chinoiserie
 The East India companies started trading in the 17th century  and by the beginning of the 18th century Europe was fascinated
by all things from the orient. European artists started to go to the Orient and paint watercolours and publish books of hand-coloured aquatints, which enabled people to see for the first time the man-made structures as well as the flora and fauna and landscapes of the East. Around 1700 the first wallpapers were bought back from China by the East India Company and soon became
known as 'India' papers.
Between then and the early 19th century most of the crowned heads of Europe had created their own Chinese interiors to house the collections of Far Eastern artefacts brought back by the East India Company and other traders and adventurers. Drottningholm, The Brighton Pavilion, Sans Souci, Schloss W?rlitz, Charlottenburg and Oranienbaum are some of the palaces where you can still see these wonderful papers.
we is continuing this tradition of using Chinoiserie that reached its height around 1760 when Thomas Chippendale purchased
Chinese wallpapers for the interior of Nostell Priory in the North of England.
Using the same techniques as in the 18th Century, we is uniquely placed to create the highest quality wallpapers, enabling you to create your very own exotic Oriental interior. We are continually adapting and colouring our bird and flower designs to fit all kinds of surroundings.<p>jameite papers are all hand-painted. It is almost impossible to reproduce the exact colour shown although we always try to achieve the best match possible. Variations within and between panels in both the background and the design colours should be considered to be one of the charms and qualities of our papers and not a defect.
Our aim is to bring colour and happiness to your home.",1318319540

)<p>The basic idea is that you have an unknown original image and it is convolved with an unknown blurring kernel to produce the observed image. It turns out that problem is ill-posed. You could have a bizzare original image blurred with just the right bizzare blurring kernel to produce the observed image. So to estimate both the original image and the kernel, you have to minimize the reconstruction error with respect to the observed image, while penalizing unlikely blurring kernels or original images. If one extracts enough statistics from a dataset of natural images, one can tell whether an image is likely or not by comparing that image's statistics to the corresponding statistics of your dataset of natural images. Similarly, simple blurring kernels are favored over complex ones (think ""short arc of motion"" vs. ""tracing the letters of a word with your camera"")",1318318183

InFocus (the current version) will only do linear trajectories, though -- it can't handle curves as well as this Photoshop sneak does.<p>The parameter preload isn't cheating -- if they're anything like the InFocus params, they're pretty obvious but somewhat tedious. They're things like telling it that you're trying to correct motion blur rather than focus blur, what level of artifacting you're willing to put up with (for forensics or text recovery, you can put up with a lot of noise in the uninteresting part of the picture), the desired hardness of recovered edges, that sort of thing.

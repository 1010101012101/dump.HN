Just because PG didn't like your idea, that doesn't mean you're a failure, it just means that PG didn't fund you.

It's all about making something that people want.  Everything else is distraction.  What PG said, PG's attitude towards Flash vs Comet is irrelevant.  Not having mind share in the hacker community regarding your favorite technolgies is tough, but success in getting hackers to use your comet framework for development is much different than success in getting users to use the cool stuff you put on the web using comet<p>No one in user land cares about the framework, they just care about the cool and useful website you built.  So, focus on that.",1199863958

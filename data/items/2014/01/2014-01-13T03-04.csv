Just like there are physiological differences between male and female bodies, there are measurable physiological differences in the brains of men and women. Of course, there&#x27;s exceptions to every &quot;rule&quot;. There are very tall women and very short men. There are female programmers and male nurses. I believe in equal opportunity, but I don&#x27;t think we should be trying to force &quot;equality&quot; in the numbers of male and female programmers. That seems very counterproductive, and perhaps unnatural.",1389585555

I cannot imagine how much effort it takes to fight against the misconceptions and prejudices of various local groups to achieve this massive milestone.<p>I am still worried though.<p>I have seen large groups of people who still refuse to vaccinate the newborns in their community. The ignorance and misinformation that is widespread even in the supposedly well educated stratas of society is just mind boggling.<p>I know many well educated people (some are teachers!) who have not given ANY vaccination to their newborns.<p>A few months ago, my father (a doctor) had a visitor from his native village. The visitor (who was a distant relative too) had come to consult dad about his ailments. One of his hands was disabled. While we were having coffee, the guy asked dad about the polio vaccination drive that is happening in the village and how he and the others are not vaccinating the infants. They believe that America is trying to sterilize muslims to reduce the population. They believe that vaccination can cause autism etc. So dad reminded our visitor that his hand is disabled because he had caught polio in his childhood. STILL, the dude was arguing with my dad. Needless to say, I was furious at the state of affairs for the next few days :(",1389585508

Dogs inherently have a hunting and chasing instinct, so in the wild a dog will try and spook a cat to make it run, and then chase it and try and kill it if it does. If the cat doesn&#x27;t run, or better yet, fights back (I&#x27;ve seen multiple cats do this), the dog will back off. And cats know enough to be concerned when a giant animal approaches, which is likely to trigger a fight or flight response, if the cat doesn&#x27;t feel sufficiently protected where it is.<p>And many people have both dogs and cats living together, even in some instances sleeping together. I suspect the dog views the cat as a pack animal (and important to the owner, the alpha), and the cat views the dog as a source of warmth, but that is still very different from &quot;inherently know(ing) they don&#x27;t like each other&quot;.",1389585499

Were you talking about places other than USA?

In the U.S. for example, 34.6% of wealth is owned by the top 1%.<p>Let&#x27;s reflect on the difference:<p>- In the bitcoin network, 80% of the wealth is owned by 1% of bitcoin holders.<p>- In the U.S. 84.9% of wealth is owned by the wealthiest 20% of Americans.<p>The uneven distribution of wealth in the United States presents a gross reality. If bitcoin were to reach mass adoption (and surmount other forms of currency) and the top 1% didn&#x27;t budge from their holdings, it would create an even more incredible inequality where we would potentially have people richer than the U.S. government.

7048797,comment,7048320,7048572,11,0,analog31,,,">>> the purpose of a Ph.D.: to produce a piece of original research, which is necessarily extremely specialized.<p>I&#x27;d modify this a bit, since a PhD candidate is still a student, and still works under a teacher. The purpose is to learn how to produce original research, by doing it under a mentor. The mentor has some responsibility to guide the student away from making themselves so specialized and unemployable that their first research result is their last.<p>Now, I think that as students move up the ladder, they are afforded greater responsibility for their own careers, and greater freedom to -- frankly -- make mistakes. A PhD student should be able to figure out that a job in business might require being conversant in business. But they should also be free to master a skill that no employer cares about, with eyes-open awareness of the risk to their careers.<p>On the other hand, a student could also think strategically about their research project and employment prospects. I had a physics thesis project with a particular research goal, but considerable latitude as to how I could carry it out, and I steered the project through a series of obstacles that &quot;forced&quot; me to become demonstrably proficient in areas such as electronics and programming, which also happened to be my hobbies. In other words, I tackled a specialized problem by being a generalist.<p>My father gained his PhD yet was and is a generalist. He went to work in industry. Perhaps this gave me a natural role model, and a background that enabled me to manage the same transition.",1389584845

The corpus of evidence in our field is quite weak and doesn&#x27;t support almost any interesting claim you might make about it. For example, there&#x27;s no empirical data supporting version control [1].<p>There are books that purport to derive software development lessons from the research literature, but they&#x27;re either not very good (because they rely on crappy studies and/or go beyond what the studies support) or not very interesting (because they merely transcribe the results of very narrow studies). An anthology of the literature was published recently [2], and it falls in the latter category. I bought it to get the state of the art in empirical research and found it contained almost nothing of use to me as a practitioner. Many of the studies were shoddy (e.g. qualitative case histories--a euphemism for &quot;anecdote&quot;) and the better ones are so careful to limit themselves to the tiny experiments they did that you can&#x27;t derive anything from them. I could mention a couple of exceptions, though, if anyone&#x27;s interested.<p>I think the root problem is that software development is complicated, so to do rigorous formal studies on it is expensive.

Two, I feel like an undergraduate software course covers 75% of the material in the book (at least mine did). Maybe people have learned since it was first published, or maybe I&#x27;ve just worked on pretty good teams that practiced the stuff, but nothing in there was ground breaking or made me a better developer.

7048676,comment,7048169,7048169,2,0,brc,,,"This was always on the cards, the only surprise to me is that someone has moved on it so fast.<p>The major problem facing governments over growth of electric cars is loss in tax revenue currently enjoyed from fuel taxes.  In most places the amount of fuel tax collected far exceeds that which is spent on road infrastructure.  Governments simply take activities with inelastic demand as the best place for collecting revenue.  Because fuel was primarily used for transportation, which has a very inelastic curve, it always has been heavily taxed.  Same goes for airline travel and smoking.  Flying and tobacco taxes all normally bring in far more revenue than they cost the government - because taxes are levied on a basis of extract sufficient feathers from the goose with a minimum of hissing.<p>The problem with electric cars (as far as revenue collection goes) is that you can plug them in anywhere.   But putting extra broad-based taxes on electricity consumption is electoral poison.  So how to tax vehicle-destined electricity?  If electric cars start to supplant liquid fuels in large numbers, governments are looking at a major revenue source drying up.<p>Adding a fixed charge seems like a simple but problem-ridden way of solving it, but makes more sense than trying to do things like have specially-taxed outlets for electric cars.<p>Personally I think a per-mile charge based on vehicle size is the correct way to go (regardless of fuel type or vehicle class).  Drive less, pay less. Drive smaller vehicles, pay less.  But doing so naturally attracts the ire of those with a problem being tracked.  And so on we go.  Taxation is imperfect.<p>My guess is that they are doing this before electric-car ownership becomes a big group.  That way a smaller charge can be introduced and normalised before the group gets too large.  It&#x27;s always easier to incrementally creep up a tax rather than introduce a new one.",1389582603

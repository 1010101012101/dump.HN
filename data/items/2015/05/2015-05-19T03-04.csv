That&#x27;s very much, in fact, how the game engines do so well. They have the task of &quot;throw as much as we can in triangle buffers onto the card, and occasionally draw with uniforms set to our desired transform matrices, and let the Z-buffer and pixel shaders sort it out.&quot;<p>By contrast, the DOM may have any number of properties twiddled at any time, and the layout engine is forced to deal with that. A random float or something could cause hundreds and thousands of nodes to reflow.<p>There is a cost to such flexibility, to be sure, but it&#x27;s not <i>inefficient</i> for no good reason--the tradeoff was made to lower the entry to program it and to allow maximum malleability.",1432007896

When querying, you need to exclude malformed JSON by using the ISJSON() operator.<p>I get the argument that nvarchar makes it work with all tooling, but one could make the argument that if your tools don&#x27;t support JSON already then perhaps they need to get with the times.<p>Imagine if SQL Server didn&#x27;t have any date types and you had to query an nvarchar data type with ISDATETIME() and then get the year via DATE_VALUE(t.OrderDate, &#x27;$.year&#x27;).

9568052,comment,9566064,9567669,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> There is hope: Google went from a famous, NoSQL player to inventing an amazing, strong-consistency RDBMS (F1). Let&#x27;s hope more follow.<p>The problem is at a large distributed scale forcing consistency is basically fighting with the laws of physics. Is something in Australia always consistent with something in US? Well &quot;same time&quot; is a funny thing in physics because it doesn&#x27;t actually exist. So we have to work really hard to keep consistency going.<p>To illustrage, here is how Spanner (F1) works:<p>---<p>Spanner&#x27;s &#x27;TrueTime&#x27; API depends upon GPS receivers and atomic clocks that have been installed in Google&#x27;s datacentres to let applications get accurate time readings locally without having to sync globally.<p>---<p>I call that a cludge in the general sense, not amazing future technology. Yes if you can afford to install GPS antennas on your datacenters you can handle it and it is ok. But it is a crutch. &quot;Well but there is NTP one might say say&quot;. Yeah there is, and connectivity to that fails as well.<p>The one interesting research area though is CRDTs. These are datatypes that know how to auto-converge to a known value even if they experience temporary inconsistency. So you basically experience temporary inconsistency but it fixes itself.",1432007391

Given the amount of judicial and supervision time required for a drug court, the courts tend to be very selective as to who can be diverted into that process. They prefer young people with no prior history and those individuals are put through a very stringent process with the threat of going to jail or prison for noncompliance.<p>The rub here is that that group of people (young, nonviolent first-time offenders) tend not to reoffend anyway. In that light, these courts take credit for putting someone through this process who would have been just as likely to never see the court again if she or he had just been issued a fine or given a stern talking-to. For this group, just being in jail for a night is enough to stop (or never get caught again).<p>What makes this sadder, I think, is that there are many other people in the system that would benefit from this kind of specialized attention from judges and probation officers. The success rate for that group would be much lower, but the individual successes would be more impressive.

A forward renderer (or a light deferred, or tiled deferred, or forward plus, etc) would easily prove the same point.<p>The precompiled logic thing is nonsense. This happens on the fly in games too. Shaders get compiled on the device, assets streamed in from disk or the network. Game behavior is typically scripted and patched, etc. Narrow selection of hardware? 10 years ago? Wrong. I work on a game engine that fully supports a 10 year old machine, and most state of the art engines can degrade to that level too.<p>Goofy image formats? Please. DXT1-6, BC1-7, crunched assets, raw DDS, etc. We deal with tons of different formats, lossy and otherwise. Texture arrays, cubemaps, etc too. Malformed XML documents are trivial with a good lexer and we need tons of validation too on our side. Many games patch themselves.<p>The game can scale to a mobile device believe or not. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense to. Throttling draw calls or streaming only the lowest mip levels is trivial for a good engine.<p>The web is absolutely 100% less efficient than a commercial game engine and does far far less. The flip side is that the barrier to entry is way lower as well. It takes less experience to write a web app than it takes to author a game. I would argue that authoring a web renderer is easier than authoring a state of the art game renderer too, although there are certainly complexities there. The DOM scene graph compared to a game scene graph? Come on, is there even a comparison? I could dump a scene graph for you which is totally dynamically generated in real time that dwarfs the most complicated web page you could find. I mean, heck, we use BVHs, KD trees, octrees, and more to represent our scene graphs. You think the DOM has even a fraction of that complexity?<p>Too quote you, &quot;seriously, just stop for a second and use your head.&quot;",1432006226

Take this case, Google took off because they were able to scale-out with off-the-shelf hardware, compared to the millions banks were pouring in for scale-up configurations which handled much less load. Scale-up can quickly hit hard limits, before it becomes exponentially expensive to continue on the path. This is true even today.<p>NoSQL movement, if you wanna call it that, took off because most apps (including Google, including Financial Services, even Health Care) don&#x27;t need some types of consistency offered by relational databases. Many large apps are significantly de-normalized and have many foreign-key less tables, often filled up by scheduled jobs. That&#x27;s fine for most apps; NoSQL architectures recognize that and users consider that in design.<p>For the majority of use-cases out there, NoSQL databases offer enough consistency.

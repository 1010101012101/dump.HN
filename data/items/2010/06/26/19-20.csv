1464186,comment,1463751,1464090,0,0,nostrademons,,,"In practice, it turns out to be easier to do with if-else statements as well.<p>A factory pattern is useful when you know ahead of time along what dimensions your system will change.  You can build an interface with methods for each of those change points, then call out to those methods when appropriate.  For each experimental variant, you provide a different implementation and instantiate it based on experiment selection at the factory.<p>Unfortunately, these types of configuration changes, by definition, tend to be <i>experimental</i>.  Meaning you have no idea how the app is going to change to accommodate them, you just have an idea that might or might not help users and you want to test that hypothesis as quickly as possible.  Rearchitecting your app to build the appropriate factory interfaces takes significantly longer than just throwing in an if, and it's all wasted effort if the experiment comes back with a null result (as many do).<p>If you find yourself making experimental changes to the same areas often, <i>then</i> you might want to look at introducing a Factory.  But design patterns in general are something you reach for once the system has matured, not something you do when you're still experimenting and exploring the domain.",1277582352
1464185,comment,1462209,1463133,0,0,eru,,,"I am OK with passing judgement like that.  I was more concerned about confusion with another meaning of the term Real Programmer:<p>""A particular sub-variety of hacker: one possessed of a flippant attitude toward complexity that is arrogant even when justified by experience. The archetypal Real Programmer likes to program on the bare metal and is very good at same, remembers the binary opcodes for every machine he has ever programmed, thinks that HLLs are sissy, and uses a debugger to edit his code because full-screen editors are for wimps. Real Programmers aren't satisfied with code that hasn't been tuned into a state of tenseness just short of rupture. Real Programmers never use comments or write documentation: “If it was hard to write”, says the Real Programmer, “it should be hard to understand.” Real Programmers can make machines do things that were never in their spec sheets; in fact, they are seldom really happy unless doing so. A Real Programmer's code can awe with its fiendish brilliance, even as its crockishness appalls. Real Programmers live on junk food and coffee, hang line-printer art on their walls, and terrify the crap out of other programmers — because someday, somebody else might have to try to understand their code in order to change it. Their successors generally consider it a Good Thing that there aren't many Real Programmers around any more. For a famous (and somewhat more positive) portrait of a Real Programmer, see The Story of Mel' in Appendix A. The term itself was popularized by a letter to the editor in the July 1983 Datamation titled Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal by Ed Post, still circulating on Usenet and Internet in on-line form.""

1464148,comment,1463855,1463855,0,0,andrewbaron,,,"I was a philosophy major and figured out accidentally in an academic setting that logic was one of my strong suits. After considering law, I decided I didn't want to live my day-to-life dealing with using tactics of logic and the legal system to battle against others. Of all the classes I ever took however, the most useful class for me personally was logic as it did the most to prepare me for doing business deals. Most business deals finally come down to negotiating and its good to make sure you can justify your value and easily knock down anyone who tries to undermine your value, on the spot, especially for fallacious reasons. And the more you have command of logic, the more your other qualities which are helpful for doing business deals may shine. This seems to be the case especially for those who like to design their own deals instead of take a defensive role to the another party's designs. And then comes the discussions of more in-depth terms, and logic becomes more and more useful all the way through the end of a contract. And ultimately, lawyers, who you may depend on for this part of your deal, are not usually meant to act as advisors to your business and tell you what you want to do, they are usually there just to protect you.<p>As others have pointed out, calling a logical fallacy card to ding an opponent may indeed often miss the point if the objective is to simply win, though I have found in doing business deals, it is logic that is most useful to protect my value and ideas, as opposed to just winning them.<p>So I would suggest that this is an article worth close study and that leaning about fallacies is a great way to get right at the elements involved in sound logic.<p>*note: this comment was not meant to be an argument, just a ""subjective"" comment for consideration.",1277580675

A lot of those sell more copies than most desktop apps would <i>dream</i> of.  You can put open source apps on the store, and it could impact a <i>ton</i> of people.  Why isn't it happening?  Android apps, from what I've seen, have a similar comparison - while many of the successful open source apps are unique in some functionality, the <i>vast</i> majority of the polished design seems to be coming from small companies.  And Android is <i>far</i> more appealing to most programmers / geeks who value open source.  What's the disconnect coming from, if not lack of <i>supply</i>?<p>I've yet to see more than low-double-digits of beautifully designed open source programs, and the majority of those were made entirely by <i>one person</i>, often open-sourced because they didn't think they could get enough money to make monetizing it worthwhile.

Meanwhile, the rest of the world has been utterly <i>rocketing</i> towards more focus on design, and has a long history of success.<p>Want more evidence?  <i>Look at games</i>.

There's an entire <i>industry</i> oriented around UI/UX and design... and where's the open source influence?  Bad Civilization / Quake clones?  A lot of the unique designs I've seen have been done by individuals <i>without</i> open sourcing the code, for whatever reason.<p>And yes, OOo is frightening on many levels.  It's a worst case scenario, and I recognize it... but I see it echoed frequently in other OSS projects.<p><i>I have not said</i> OSS cannot produce good UIs.  <i>I have said</i> there seems to be a trend, and at least I have seen <i>far</i> less.

And interesting you said C and Python.<p>A few years ago I was thinking about what would be the minimum set of languages that would be good to know in order to be able to do almost anything you wanted, and do it well, and to always be employable. I ruled out 1 language alone because of the C phenomenon: there's a whole class of software where today C is the best choice, and a whole different set where C is a bad choice. Therefore, the ideal set was 2+ with C being one. I ended up settling on C, Java and Python. Java for enterprise/BigDumbCompany work, but also because there's a lot of great tooling and innovation happening in the Java space more so than other langs. Python for the role of glue and prototyping and high level no boilerplate bureaucracy but where you could still trust every developer using it. Ruby could probably fill that role decently instead, except be a little better or worse in diff areas.<p>C, Java, Python<p>Then I found out that Google had picked these three as well.

PHP crept in there (just for includes)  - the web team went from one person to an entire department in a short period of time, and some functionality keeps creeping in there - some of it done by developers, some of it done by web PHP guys who shouldn't really be writing code.  Incremental direct updates to the site on a daily basis are a regular thing by far too many people.<p>I'm sure many people have the same story.<p>The challenge is in taking the current situation and turning it into something manageable with release control, testing, and so on - because it's at a point where a simple mistake by a designer can (and has) effectively taken the site down, and due to the nature of the update process, it's hard to find out 'wtf' just happened.   \nThe GOOD part is everyone is on-board with changing things (no politics).<p>The hard part is figuring out what those changes are - as soon as we started trying to fit this into the standard developer workflow, it was obvious that we were adding far, far too much un-needed technical bureaucracy (do we have a word for that?) for no real benefit - and the idea that the release and deployment tools are where the real benefit is is really becoming apparent - the version-control system is necessary, but it's not strictly the most important piece.<p>So for me, these slides (wish I could see the talk that went with it) really helps cement that I'm not insane for thinking differently about how this should work.",1277579614

I get almost completely the opposite take on Ruby versus Python though:<p>There are a number of things that made me think Ruby was made by a less astute designer. The 'end' everywhere feels bad in a world where I know both ""}"" and a newline can accomplish the same thing but with less typing and screen clutter. Also do not like Ruby's dropping of ()'s from fn call statements, because it blurs the boundary with non-calls and non-expressions and control flow keywords. I also feel Ruby encourages a certain kind of DSL creation which makes the code harder to read and maintain. I also don't think every app or library needs to export a DSL into client space. It's better if the interface it publishes still looks and feels like the prog language used.<p>That said, I acknowledge Ruby has good qualities. Python is not perfect, but to me it gives the better designed feeling. Actually the Lisps seem to be the most elegant and powerful.

Use a nice dictionary, set, tuple or a list, nicely kept under the [ ] brackets. Throw them in for loops without the iteration integer.

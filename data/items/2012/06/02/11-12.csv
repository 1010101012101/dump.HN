It never flew.<p>I imagine after 15 years they may have a chance at this, but I would caution those of you who have never worked in huge government IT shops to take this with a grain of salt. The situation is so bad in many places that Congress has been passing laws making it illegal for the federal systems not to behave in a certain way. And still things are broken. We passed the point of desperation many years ago.<p>Big IT in general is broken, and government IT is the most dysfunctional of any IT on the planet. I remain hopeful that this executive order can accomplish something, but I'm not holding my breath on it. Hopeful is one thing. Excited like this guy is? Not at all. Maybe in another 15 years.

I'm probably thinking about it from the UK perspective where I don't think it'll have that same impact.

If you block one of the malicious sites then you also end up blocking legitimate sites, and since Cloudflare goes out of their way to not take down sites (even those hosting malicious programs- including the drive by exploits that install them) it makes it very difficult to trace the malware back to it's source or actually take it down and stop people from getting infected.",1338635467

My terrorist comment wasn't comparing them to terrorists, I guess a better point would have been ""no honor among thieves"".

A few years ago I tried to work with their site to extract some data and automate some of my personal movie recommendations and it turned out to be a huge mess. At a point their web interface even inserted place holders inside the query strings. If they made some improvements I would be happy to work with the site again.",1338635171
4057791,comment,4056311,4057521,19,0,woodpanel,,,"When I asked the guy running the local tourist/visitor-center in some small town in PA what to do out there, his second question (after 'where you from?') was: 'So how are you baptised?' It took me some time to think about an answer. This question was odd to me for a couple of reasons:<p>1) I have never been asked that question in my whole life.<p>2) I haven't been baptised.<p>3) I didn't want to offend him, so after some time I figured it would be more offensive if he caught me lying.<p>4) It still was uncomfortable because the german stereotype of the religeous american is one of a superficial radical. This stereotype would be tested the moment I'd answer him. Would he drop his friendlliness towards me? Would he treat me differently?<p>He was strucked by my atheism in third generation. His mood went down. He was honestly concerned for me. I think I ruined his day.<p>In conclusion: My impression of the religious american (the most religeous one that I've met so far) was a good one. He was open about his believe, believing it consequentially (from what i've saw) and not a bigot (he didn't drop his friendliness).",1338635114

Any fool can get a C program to work, but ensuring there are no memory leaks etc is very hard without a tool like Valgrind.<p>If you don't believe me, just run Valgrind on random sampling of C programs that didn't use such a tool - I reckon it will find issues with most of them.",1338634837

I am now learning Lisp (not exactly, I'm <i>using</i> Lisp in SICP), and use Python more than before.<p>One thing I realized, is that <i>reading</i> C is more tedious than code in other languages. Sure that's a gross generalization and is not true for every piece of code out there. However, I find I have less troubles picking up a Python project, understanding how it's written and start contributing than I have with C.<p>A few weeks ago, I was looking at the code of Qemu. The code relies heavily on preprocessor macros and some weird gcc-only syntax that made my head hurt. It was difficult.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say, my only problem with C is that it doesn't force the programmer to write in a clear understandable way. Or maybe that's just me.",1338634822

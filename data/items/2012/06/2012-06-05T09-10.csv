4068051,comment,4066826,4067873,6,0,mayanksinghal,,,"> The real problem isn't reproducibility, it is extensibility<p>I think its both. Extensibility is obviously an issue. But so is extensibility, I will give two reasons for it:<p>1. Easy reproducibility is necessary for extensibility. Firstly, academia is not very good at publishing their tools or their codebases. We have given so much weight to the concept behind the implementations and not the implementations themselves, that most people skip publishing implementations. What it means is that the next research group now has to start from scratch in implementing the concepts before they can think of extending the work. Reproducibility is not only to verify previously reported results, but also to create a starting point for further work. Secondly, given that the tools that the researcher is using is proprietary, the trend is to make it closed source. It may be because the tool is not ubiquitous and hence the researcher sees no point in distributing his/her implementations - or because he had not followed any guidelines (or in case of Matlab and Mathematica - they didn't exist/were-not-popular). He might not be sure about his implementations, and hence cannot publish them.<p>2. Reproducibility has always been the base for science. I don't need to trust the work a random researcher that I don't personally know. I can just verify his/her findings myself. The requirement of commercial software creates a huge monetary barrier in this. It is wasteful of me to buy a licence for a simple verification that I am not planning to extend. Given that non-academic licenses of most of these softwares are insanely expensive, it makes this verification to be confined to researchers from big research groups in large companies.",1338889811

You have a hard job retrofitting performance to Python<p>* typos.  Typos that survive my Integration Tests which can never have enough coverage.  Stuff that just won't compile in a static language becomes a runtime issue on a dynamic language, and they can hide for months outside the happy path e.g. in some error handing code<p>* poor libraries.  I get nice warm happy feelings about various async server frameworks that last until I have to debug them and stare at their innards and realised they were contributed to and diluted by twits<p>* pip/virtualenv doing a poor job with native code in modules<p>At least it has namespaces / modules and such<p>At least its not common for every 3rd party lib to want to squat on a function called $<p>And so on.<p>Static typing is a major plus when you are beyond the prototyping stage and heading heading towards the release and maintenance phase.<p>Which is why I'm on the look out for implicitly strongly statically typed languages that look like Python :)",1338888300

4068006,comment,4067297,4067431,3,0,sinzone,,,"Agreed. Facebook could do everything.<p>Any economical transaction involves a social transaction as well. Facebook, can be the underlying architecture of every economy.<p>Facebook is at the core of a large, new economic ecosystem: apps, websites, ads, mobile, causes, almost everything you can think of.They can enter in any business, and for sure they are going to expand these below, to rich an enormous amount of revenue over the next years.<p>Ads:I dont know about any platform that will be able to show ads to (soon) +1B people. Their current page views is impressive, around 1 trillion/month. Ads revenue still small, compared to the amount of users they have, because the right formula to show the ads to the right people takes time to arrive at a perfect level. But when it does, it will be like a sniper, it will show a product/service you want, the moment you want. The social graph is becoming the DNA of the entire world population, it will increase its value as time passes.<p>Platform/Apps: They have built one of the biggest platforms with 9MM apps. Third-party apps integration and the entire FB platform is just one the most powerful things on the internet. It allowed new companies to plug into the FB community and scale a new user base quickly. FB is basically becoming an app ecosystem, maybe more powerful than Apple itself. Millions of devs are implementing their FB authentication system FB connect, giving FB the ability to know every detail about an app usage, the ability to gather data and visualize those data to people that matter to them. Moreover, with the new App Center they can send a big portion of traffic to various mobile app stores and take a cut out of the revenue for all those price x install apps: in May 2012, 90MM users were sent directly to Apples App Store. 7 of iOS Top 10 apps and 8 of Android Top 10 apps are integrated with Facebook. App maketing is very lucrative. The LIKE button is having a tremendous impact on media, brands and basically on the overall internet traffic; its a viral machine. And being able to show events/actions in a user timeline, is incredibly powerful; listen, watch, read, cookcan you get an idea?<p>Specific APIs: There is some sort of overlap between APIs and FB platform. As of today all FB APIs are free. But I dont believe in giving for free additional value will last forever. Directly or indirectly FB will start to monetize its API calls. Directly by charging the premium usage of the Social Graph data or other specific ad-hoc new APIs and indirectly by taking a cut of the revenue that third-party developers are generating by leveraging FB APIs. The Social Graph owns more than 100 Petabytes of user data, thats 2x the size of the entire written works of mankind. 12,8% of the world population generates real-time data, analyzed and stored by Facebook. Obviously, some APIs will remain free but the rest will be a cash machine.<p>Coupons/Deals: They failed here, but they will not give up. With FB Mobile, they know where you are. They can show you related deals the moment you enter in club or a grocery. A Groupon-like experience, but empowered with a more accurate location, your personal tastes and of course, friends with theirrecommendations.<p>Facebook Credits/Payments: I believe this is going to be a tremendous revenue stream over the years. It may even surpass the Ads revenue one day. I envision a world, where every time you have to pay over the internet and offline you will have to just click a button: Pay with Facebook Credits from Ebay to Expedia or use your FB mobile app at the cashier. It will become the universal currency.<p>Much more: there are a tons of things that they can do, from user subscriptions (imagine having just 10% of the users paying $9/month to access premium services); travels, to organize weddings. But you know what? They dont need to, there is the platform for that.<p>Facebook is basically becoming a new kind of telco. Facebook is speed. A new version of Facebook is released every Tuesday, there are 12,000 modifications per month, more than 1000 developers deliver code to be released each week. Facebook average employee is 26 years-old.<p>FB could do everything.",1338888221

It's just not all that likely.<p>There is also a possibility that Facebook won't be able to monetize with the same effectiveness as Google. It's also possible that Facebook will have fewer active users in 2020.<p>Valueing a company purely in terms of its current cashflows and assets without taking into account its potential is wrong. I'm not saying that. Companies have quality and Facebook is absolutely a quality company. This way of thinking about businesses (good companies & bad companies) is rightly ingrained in the way we talk about companies. Talking about them as over/under valued companies seems shortsighted and it is, especially if you are talking about startups. When good startup investors make their most hopeful investments, valuation comes second.<p>This is also true of bigger companies. Google has quality that Yahoo doesn't. Facebook has quality that Groupon doesn't.  Warren Buffet evaluates companies this way - great companies at a fair price.<p><i>but..</i><p>every rule of thumb has a reductio ad absurdum.

The way its priced even defines as failure outcomes that should be defined as success.

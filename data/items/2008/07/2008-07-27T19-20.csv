Gödel's theorem states that any non-trivial mathematical theory that has a finite description is either inconsistent or incomplete.""<p>That's from the Wiki, FWIW. I'm not big on using Wiki as a source.<p>""Babbling religiously"" is right on the line in my opinion. It makes you sound like an arrogant jerk. If you have problems with the content of the comment, state your case in neutral terms.<p>Learn to live with other people's ambiguity and looseness in phrasing. Then perhaps they'll be more forgiving of yours. (Downmod)",1217188400
258378,comment,257391,258055,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I agree that the proof is pretty much handwaving, actually, but I still think their underlying conclusion is valid: Our  efforts into optimizing languages should focus on making <i>programmers</i> more efficient, before hardware. (In other words, programmer time is almost always more expensive than processor time.)<p>Also, I think most things in computing called X's Law are not entirely serious, these days.",1217188041

258375,comment,258208,258272,0,0,breck,,,"Absolutely. It is probably a good sign that they took that down. If you show you are making peanuts, it would discourage potential competitors. If you show you are making millions, you are asking for competitors to pour in.<p>All I'm saying is that it is in my (selfish) interests to know how much they were making. Now that they don't display revenue, I won't decide to copy them until after they IPO, which will be too late, unfortunately.",1217187699

258372,comment,258154,258354,0,0,mdemare,,,"The current food crisis cannot be blamed on third world governments, as was the case in most earlier famines. This crisis in caused by a sudden spike in the price of rice, grain and other staples.

And we should be very careful before we commit one fifth of arable land to biofuels.<p>Ultimately this food crisis is caused by poverty, and there's no easy cure for that.",1217186839

They don't support Linux, and yet they intentionally detect Linux and have special code written for it that doesn't work, when the standard code does work.

(Virtualmin winter 07)<p>I believe the three months was worth the equity, and we're still able to call on them when we need some advice or an introduction.  My only hesitation in recommending YC to any relatively inexperienced entrepreneur would come from the increasing size of the programs...but I'm a serious introvert and I don't like crowds, so I might be judging the impact it has incorrectly.<p>But, it's hard to argue that YC doesn't have a very real positive impact on the companies it funds.  The success rate, given how early they invest, is quite high so far, and the biggest successes are yet to come.",1210143350
183219,comment,183169,183169,0,0,demallien,,,"Does anyone else here dislike automated unit testing?<p>Where I work, we have unit tests that are all hand-coded.  Even with that, it takes half an hour to run through the full suite - too long to do on any minor change, but still manageable when preparing a sandbox for checkin.<p>If we added in automated tests, we would have many times the number of tests, with a corresponding increase in the time taken to make them run.  If you can't run unit tests quickly, their value is reduced.<p>I personally feel that a well-designed test framework should test all of the common use cases, some obvious edge cases, and should be easily adaptable so that when bugs are found, you can readily create a unit test that reproduces the bug, preventing regression.<p>I'm curious as to how others here decide which unit tests to write.",1210143290

Promoting something consumer-oriented, building your brand, attracting those visitors will cost you hundreds of thousand of dollars, millions even.<p>The rule of ""build it and they will come"" does not apply to consumer-targeted internet-entertainment business. Media businesses require either lots of luck, or massive investments into PR (and still some luck). Digg, Reddit, TechCrunch, even CNN - they all had some ""lucky event"", something out of their control, which contributed to their boost in popularity. Technology takes the back seat, unless you have something truly groundbreaking, like Google had.<p>Sorry to deliver the bad news, but your $50K are irrelevant, find some well-connected people to support you. Reddit wouldn't have happened without Paul's PR machine.",1210143275

183215,comment,182974,183181,0,0,cperciva,,,"You can do incremental backups using tarsnap if you really want, using the --newer-mtime option (tarsnap can do anything that tar can do); but you don't actually want that.  Tarsnap automatically does snapshotted backups (I posted some explanation of the difference a few minutes ago in <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=183213"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=183213</a>) -- so all you need to do is tell tarsnap that you want to create another backup archive, and it will magically avoid storing multiple copies of the same data.",1210142600

183213,comment,182974,183193,0,0,cperciva,,,"Duplicity provides incremental backups; it doesn't provide snapshotted backups.  Snapshotted backups are the ""best of both worlds"" between full backups and incremental backups -- you get the semantics of full backups (each individual backup can be restored or deleted without touching the other backups) along with the efficiency and performance of incremental backups (if only a few files have changed since your last backup, taking a new backup is very fast).<p>It may be that duplicity is adequate for your needs, but I did consider it before I started writing tarsnap, and decided that duplicity wasn't good enough for me.",1210142414

183207,comment,183128,183128,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"1) Definitely go for a market-led not technology-led business idea (ie, one where the demand exists, rather than one where you have to invest time and money educating the market).<p>2) You then need to Position yourself in the market that's demanding it. This requires you to develop a consistent profile in the marketplace, so when people think of 'Generic Need' they immediately associate it with 'poppysan' before anybody else.<p>3) Above all, believe in your business. If you're confident, you will invest emotionally and be productive. If you're not, the market will see you as a frantic mess to be left alone for a while...and you don't have a while!",1210140621

A very small percentage actually succeed. Try to do it part-time and see where it goes.<p>In my experience this has been the better path. I worked fulltime on an ad supported site for 3 months, plunking 10k into it(and living expenses), and got about $200 in return.<p>Another site, which I built in a day, has generated over $10K for me in ad revenue. It's a big crapshoot and going full time probably won't increase your odds too much. Wait til the traffic is big enough, not your desire.",1210140338

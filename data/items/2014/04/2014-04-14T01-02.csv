Those NaCl\ndevs wrote NaCl for free.&quot;<p>- &quot;How hard could it be to implement a crypto library? Nacl was a side project. The Nacl devs &#x27;have day jobs in \nacademia&#x27; and created nacl in their spare time. They did it for free, so they obviously didn&#x27;t need to spend money on \ntesting environment, research material or hire/consult experts.

I think it is a shining example of \nmodern civil society; you have the US, NL and the EU teaming up to fund strong crypto by top notch folks from a \nnumber of countries. Governments should fund research, applied and basic, and they should be encouraged to fund \nmore of it.<p>Somewhat tangential: Knowledge of the grants also seeks to eliminate the\nidiocy in the latter two examples above. People need to be reminded that\nbig government is not always an evil force, governments can be a force\nfor good. I do not know if you saw my other comment about tor funding\nbut tor had revenue of \\$2+ million in 2012 and 60% came from US\ngovernment. I don&#x27;t know where you are from but I bet you have met a\nsimple minded moron wearing a tea party costume or trendy European\nthreads that will not stop complaining about the evil Obama surveillance\nadministration. Blow their minds and ask them to wrap their heads around\nthe:<p>- $800k from DoD for &quot;Basic and Applied Research and Development in\nAreas Relating to the Navy Command, Control, Communications,\nComputers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance&quot;<p>or<p>- $350k from State for &quot;Programs to Support Democracy, Human Rights\nand Labor&quot; and &quot;New America Foundation: International Programs to\nSupport Democracy, Human Rights&quot;<p><pre><code>  > Is the funding not transparent enough?\n</code></pre>\nIf this is in regards to the lack of numbers from NWO or the EU I am\nsure that I am at fault.

In my case, I knew someone at the company where I got hired, and was hired for a sort of &#x27;unspecified assistant / other&#x27; position, and took on every single &#x27;hey we need a script to...&#x27; task I could find until they gave me bigger projects. You need a story besides &quot;I am a developer&quot; to get your foot in the door, and your business degree is probably the place to start. What insights could your programming experience give you that a person with a comparable background would never have? What kinds of product opportunities could you spot that a great developer might not notice? So my first piece of advice is about your objective. Try to find the specific combination of skills and interests that you have that few other people have, and then think about where all of them might be useful.<p>My second piece of advice is about your skill set. As someone who is mostly self-taught, it&#x27;s going to be hard for you to get people to give your work serious consideration. Your reference projects should demonstrate a serious focus on readability, documentation, and testing. I advocate for those things in general, but people like you and me actually have something to prove, and we may not get many chances to show off. So when you learn a new framework or language, make sure you understand the preferred style for code and docs, the way projects are usually organized, and one popular testing framework. Those things will reassure employers that you are serious about doing a good job, not just copying the most-complete stackexchange answer and tweaking it until it works.<p>Good luck.",1397440183

My fiancé was supporting me during this time, and I&#x27;m incredibly grateful to her for that; if I only had 2-4 hours a day to learn, I doubt I would have made the progress I did during that time, and it wouldn&#x27;t be the provider I now am for her and my 1-year-old son.",1397437983

This part was of great interest then, because reliable information on the Soviet Army was hard to come by in the days of the Iron Curtain, and the author (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Suvorov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Suvorov</a>) was a recent defector. But for today&#x27;s reader, this part is pretty dull, all tables of organization and maps of military districts. They&#x27;re all safe to skip.<p>Part IV (&quot;Mobilisation&quot;) departs from the data-dump format of the earlier chapters to talk about how the Soviet Army is organized so that in wartime it can double its number of units overnight, through a system the author calls &quot;invisible divisions.&quot; If you wondered how the USSR was able to turn things around after the early disasters following the Nazi invasion in 1941, this chapter will be of interest.<p>Part V (&quot;Strategy and Tactics&quot;) is where the book starts to get really interesting, because here it starts giving you insights into how different the way the Russians looked at war is from the way Western armies do. Part VI (&quot;Equipment&quot;) expands on that theme by showing some examples of how that type of thinking informed the way the Soviets designed weapons that became world-famous for their effectiveness, like the AK-47, the T-34 tank, and the Hind helicopter.<p>Finally, Parts VII (&quot;The soldier&#x27;s lot&quot;) and VIII (&quot;The officer&#x27;s path&quot;) are narrative descriptions of the lives of enlisted conscripts and officers in the Soviet Army.<p>Overall, I found the book useful because the author&#x27;s experience in that system taught him a lot of lessons about leadership -- especially leadership in situations where you&#x27;re expected to achieve impossible things with limited resources and mediocre (at best) people. And the stuff about Soviet strategic thinking and weapons design has lots of interesting things to say about the value of simplicity, reliability and scale over things like feature richness or even user comfort.<p>These are not arguments you hear a lot from Western writers, so they are a refreshing alternative take. He&#x27;s writing about weapons, of course, but the arguments are presented in such a fashion that you can easily extrapolate the lessons to really any kind of product.<p>(I actually referenced one of those lessons in a previous comment on HN, here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5062096"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5062096</a>)<p>You don&#x27;t have to read the book front-to-back to get the good stuff out of it; skip over the early chapters and start at Part V and you&#x27;ll get all the nutrition with none of the boring, out-of-date tables and charts and maps.",1397437500

I showed promise as a developer, plus I had other skills that they could use.

I kept at it (and have been at it for about 18 months now). I feel like i&#x27;m just now coming into my own, so to speak. i know a popular framework relatively well at this point, and while I don&#x27;t know all the nuances of several basic web technolgoies yet, I&#x27;m still studying them (also, you never stop learning even if you&#x27;re an expert).<p>the bottom line is that I found a place that would nurture me as a developer because I had promise (probably like you, if you do it for fun), and I had other skills that they could simultaneously use.

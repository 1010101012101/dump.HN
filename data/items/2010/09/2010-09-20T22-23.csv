Money transfers would continue to take place between employee and employer directly, not least because an employer may be making other deductions for the purpose of pension contributions, union dues or whatever which do not have any bearing on tax liability.<p>As I said, in the UK the government already collects all this information already.

1710790,comment,1707422,1708913,0,0,vannevar,,,"90% superficially sounds unreasonable, because we have a tendency to think that wealth is distributed on a bell curve. But wealth is not distributed that way, it is distributed according to a power law, which means that a significant number of people make in excess of $100M per year while others make less than $1000. If wealth were distributed according to skill and ability, the ratio between the highest and lowest would be much lower and billionaires would be as rare as 100 ft tall people.<p>The idea that a person could personally contribute the equivalent of $100M of value in a year per their efforts and skills (which ARE distributed on a bell curve) is absurd. It is this mismatch between the distribution of ability and the distribution of wealth that the rich exploit. So for someone making $100M/year, a 90% tax rate is not unreasonable at all.",1285023426

But I do think, that as Krugman points out, this is not the current argument.<p>In Reagan's era they would pitch trickle down as how everyone benefits from these tax cuts.  The actual stated goal was to make life better for everyone, but starting from the top.<p>The current stated goal from the right is that the rich deserve the money, and the poor do NOT deserve.  Not that the tax cuts will have some side benefit to the poor.  Rather that we need to keep the money out of the hands of the poor.  This is why the constantly use the code word ""welfare"" when talking to their base.<p>Again, there is a very rational argument to be had here.  In fact, I think a rational argument would be a very boring one for most people in the US.  But I think the reason that everyone is up in arms is not due to their passion for capitalism.

If it costs 1/10th or 1% of GDP to keep roads in repair, when the economy is booming, there may be more roads but that percentage is more dollars in real terms.<p>But what governments often do, and what Washington has done here, is just spend money on other things, let the roads get bad, and then claim that they aren't getting enough money to keep the roads up to justify raising the road taxes.<p>It is a simple game of bait-n-switch.<p>The big money is in getting people to sell future economic growth to resolve a short term artificial pain-- which is what they're trying to do now.  Sure the state income tax will be a ""tiny tax only on the rich"".... but the federal income tax started out that way, and look what it has become.<p>Washington state has spent money irresponsibly.

This was fixed a few minutes ago in FFmpeg.<p>As for H.264 on a 400MHz ARM11, no amount of command line options will magically make MPlayer manage full SD resolution.  If the H264 decoder were fully optimised for ARMv6, it might get close for low-complexity videos, but hardly any such optimisations have been done.  There is simply little point, as it would still be too slow in most cases.",1285020212

One of the things they drilled into her was to make all the interviews as alike as possible.  You MUST ask each candidate identical questions.  Her impression was that this was to protect the company in the event an un-chosen candidate found about the differences and could find some grounds to sue.  It's possible your experience sprung from the same lawsuit-averse well.",1285020211

A rich interface simply will not work with its interactivity taken away. Even something as simple as a selection rect fails under such a system. It would require a separate interface, and now we're back to where SproutCore gets us.<p>That is the dilemma of progressive enhancement.

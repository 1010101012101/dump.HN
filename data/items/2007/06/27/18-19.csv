I think niche-specific aggregation sites can be interesting & I've decided to give it a summer to prove me wrong.<p>climbers do spend a lot of time hunting for videos, pics, news online, so I think aggregation can work, on a small scale",1182970498

Either you haven't heard of them yet or you're left thinking something along the lines of ""Looks like that widget company has given up and switched to mobile im, maybe Slide or someone scared them off""",1182970385

I didn't know what their product was either until around about demo day (two months into the Winter Founders Program).  They've got some fruity MySpace widget that they built for marketing purposes and everybody thinks it's their product...their product is actually universal IM for mobile devices.  Way cooler than yet another MySpace widget, eh?<p>Matters aren't helped by the fact that the widget was released months before the product (the product is still not properly launched, I don't think).",1182968338

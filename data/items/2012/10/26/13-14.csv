A year ago I would have found this a weird question because when the actions of blogging and sharing are so culturally ingrained it's very difficult to step outside and ask ""Why?"". Now I find it instructive to do so. Sincerely and unrhetorically: ""Why did you write this?""<p>My belief at the moment is that such articles are validation-seeking. The writer draws strength from committing their plans to a socially-viewable document and subjecting it to discussion.

There's probably no agreement there, but it's a much more open question than in the old-style equilibrium analysis, where you just assume axiomatically that markets clear and respond smoothly, instantaneously, and with no system-internal dynamics to supply/demand changes. I.e., sort of like analyzing mechanical systems under the assumption that turbulent fluid flow is impossible, and catastrophic resonance doesn't happen. It's at least an open question whether a securitized market in water could increase volatility and failure modes, especially given that it's very time-critical (you can't generally go without water even for temporary periods of allocation shortage, so even a short-lived ""financial crisis"" in water could be devastating).",1351258621

The submitted article read like something out of the hard-left 1960s when I was growing up and a lot of people thought that countries with centrally planned economies were doing better than countries with free markets. They never have. Markets in water are crucial for figuring out how different users of water really value water, and how to monetize improving the quality and distribution of water. I live high upstream of most of the United States (near a continental divide), in the well watered state of Minnesota (""the land of 10,000 lakes""). This year is a drought year (although it was rainy the last two days), and even at that, we have adequate water. A controversial issue here is sale of water from the upper Midwest to arid places in the Great Plains or even the Southwest through pipelines. Banning the sale of water across state lines is not going to stop the Mississippi River or Red River (of the north) from flowing, and all the arid places in the United States have elaborately developed legal systems (unlike the riparian common law system in Minnesota and other states with abundant water) for allocating water rights. If big interstate trade in water through unit trains on railroads or through pipelines develops, the law will be able to keep up, and water will be better used in the United States.<p>If similar trade develops internationally, or domestically in formerly poor countries, again the crucial thing to do is to develop laws so that people can trade according to their needs. When people trade, they all become richer. Water is generally cleaner and more available today, serving a larger and healthier world population, than it was in my childhood. That came about BECAUSE of market economics, while the stifling poverty that resulted in famine in China in the 1960s came about from anti-market policies. I'll stick with the market when allocating important resources.<p>AFTER EDIT: The comments kindly made to my comment reminded me of life experience from living in Taiwan when Taiwan was still part of the Third World that I should relate here. For decades, the standards for water treatment of municipal water supplies in Taiwan have been up to world standards for piped water, ensuring that bacteria are reduced in the water before it leaves the water treatment plant. But in the 1980s, the dictatorial government of Taiwan at the time forced local governments to keep city water prices abnormally low, so none of the cities could afford to maintain the network of pipes that delivered water to homes. And that meant that the water flowing out of home taps could NOT be assumed to be safe. Instead, everyone all over urban Taiwan paid out of their own pockets to install filters (possibly ineffective against bacterial or protozoan contamination) on public building drinking fountains, and home dwellers paid for bottled propane gas to boil their home tap water before drinking it. (Boiling water to let it stand and cool was a big chore in those days. Some people bought special electric water-heating machines that automated the process of heating and storing tap water for drinking safety.) After three years in Taiwan, the first thing I did when I reached the home of a relative in Los Angeles upon my return to America was drink a big glass of tap water, a luxury I had been denied all that while. And my wife was HORRIFIED to see me do that. She had never seen anyone drink a glass of tap water straight out of the tap in her life.<p>As Taiwan democratized in the 1990s, the press began reporting on how ridiculously low the price of tap water was in Taiwan, and it was proposed simply to raise the price of city water, so that the city could maintain the pipe network properly and ensure clean water stayed clean all the way to home taps. I'm not sure how much progress has been made in this project to date in what parts of Taiwan, but my wife (who has been back there more recently than I have) reports that Taiwan in general is cleaner than ever, healthier than ever, and generally thriving well under democracy and a free-market economy. The bureaucrats in Taiwan were always mostly technocrats, rather smart people even in the worst times of dictatorship, but using prices to allocate resources makes more sense than using bureaucratic fiat to allocate resources. Two heads are better than one.",1351257993

Doing a Socket.IO disconnect is not a good way to trigger a non-persistent transport in Socket.IO; you are likely causing both client and server to do a bunch of extra cleanup (Socket.IO has some advanced features that require tracking connections/channels/etc).<p>- If Socket.IO is using WebSockets as your transport, then your ""Socket.IO non-persistent"" test is still testing WebSockets, not AJAX or one of the other real non-persistent connections. I would not be surprised that WebSocket connection setup and teardown might be slightly slower than AJAX connection setup. HTTP connection setup has been around since the beginning and had a lot of time to be optimized. WebSockets are relatively new and connection setup time is not something that people will probably ever care about (WebSockets are not designed to be used this way).<p>- You should really use something other that Date() for your timers. The accuracy of Date is close to the latency of WebSockets themselves and so I strongly suspect that if you are doing this to localhost, what you are actually measuring in ""Socket.IO persistent"" vs ""AJAX"" is the Date rather than the connection latency Note that the latency per request in either case stays around 3ms and the Date object returns a value in milliseconds. The ""Socket.IO non-persistent"" is probably just a measure of Date with the overhead of Socket.IO cleanup. I suggest using high performance timers: <a href=""http://updates.html5rocks.com/.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://updates.html5rocks.com/..</a>.<p>- You need to do your test between two different computers preferably with at least a switch in between. There are a lot of network stack shortcuts that happen on modern computers when you communicate over the localhost/loopback network.<p>- You are waiting 500ms between requests. I would suggest making that a variable. Interesting things will start to happen as you lower the interval. Also, as part of that, I think you probably want to put your start counter into the message data and then extract it on the other end to do the calculation. This is important because as you lower the amount of time you may start getting overlapping sends and receives (which is where things start getting interesting).<p>- You should really generate your random string outside the send block so that you aren't adding latency and CPU usage to the performance loop. Also, it would be useful to be able to tune the size of the data being sent to both larger and smaller sizes than 4K.<p>Finally, you mention in your lead off that one of the problems with WebSockets is that they are persistent so you may reach your limit of concurrent connections compared to AJAX. But in actual practice, with well designed and configured servers, you will reach server limits with AJAX requests FAR sooner than with WebSockets.<p>For example, consider an application that occasionally sends updates to a few clients and has 10,000 clients ""connected"".<p>AJAX is the worst case because every client has to establish a new connection to poll the server for data so to get sub-second latency for updates, the clients would need to make a new connection every 500ms or so. This means the server is having to setup 20,000 new HTTP connections every second.<p>Using long-poll (server hangs onto the client connection if there is no data) the client will probably have to re-establish a connection every 30 seconds (depending on server/firewall config/etc) to poll the server. This is much better, but that is still over 300 connections being established every second to the server (and only if they are evenly spread out). Also it's worth noting that with a long-poll scenario, you have most of the clients with established connections most of the time. So you'll run into connection limits just as quickly (actually sooner for various reasons) than with persistent connections.<p>With WebSocket connections, there is the initial connection setup to connect the clients, but once the clients are connected, if the server has no data to send, there is essentially NO traffic between client and server.<p>Looking forward to seeing your code and configuration. How about posting to github so that others can try and replicate your results and suggest improvements?",1351257799

It's about starting a relationship early.<p>If so maybe the sweet spot is lowering the threshold to companies that have raised less than $50,000, and giving away nearly as much in early value. Then, after the company has at least $50,000 they can start paying more and more, especially as they are better and better funded.  Initially a very small amount, but then a small treadmill upwards.<p>also, about building it into a contract? <i>Let's be honest: an unfunded startup company that has incorporated has two years to sink or swim.</i> A lot of unfunded but incorporated companies would jump at contracts that give them $50,000 in value to start growing with, and if they succeed, they are locked into (reasonable) service agreements.  it's about cash flow and relationships.  since the margins are high on these products, it makes sense for the companies that offer them to get in on it - it's a <i>small gamble</i> because there is a low <i>direct</i> cost (definition of high margin), and no <i>opportunity cost</i> because the companies don't have money anyway.

The essential feature of irony  is the indirect presentation of a contradiction between an action or expression and the context in which it occurs. In the figure of speech, emphasis is placed on the opposition between the literal and intended meaning of a statement; one thing is said and its opposite implied, as in the comment, Beautiful weather, isn't it? made when it is raining or nasty. Ironic literature exploits, in addition to the rhetorical figure, such devices as character development, situation, and plot to stress the paradoxical nature of reality or the contrast between an ideal and actual condition, set of circumstances, etc., frequently in such a way as to stress the absurdity present in the contradiction between substance and form.<p>> <i>Irony differs from sarcasm  in greater subtlety and wit.

Multiplayer is a bit of a gamble because it requires a sturdy player base, but I think it is essential. My feature list was also ambitious (physics, custom UI, ship editor), but I just pushed my launch date back until I reached my goals. I'm very happy with the final product. Check it out! There is a free demo as well.",1351256816

I mean, it's obviously a good idea for whoever curates the app store (they can leverage their power in all kinds of ways), but perhaps the problems for developers is not because these companies are doing it poorly, but just that injecting a review process by a third party between the developer and their customers is NATURALLY bad for developers.",1351256750

In a game, the challenge should be scaled appropriately so the game is neither boring nor frustrating, and so that players continue to develop and use new skills as the game goes on.<p>- data, stats, and awards.  People like to see how many posts they've made, how much karma they've accumulated, how many songs they've listened to, or how many zombies they've killed.  They like to be given titles or trophies for passing milestones.<p>- feedback from friends.  Even better than getting that 10,000 zombie trophy or that new forum rank is getting congratulations from your friends on your accomplishment.<p>- tickle the senses.  Pretty graphics or sounds make for a neat experience in games or certain social apps.  (The game ""Auditorium"", at playauditorium.com, is fantastic for this!)<p>- replayability.  The experience should remain fun time after time.  In a game, the challenge should have some variability.  In any app, the ""rewards"" -- karma, titles, pretty graphics, or what have you -- should update often enough that users are consistently reminded of them.  For socially-focused sites, it should be easy for users to generate good content for each other so that each visit seems rewarding.  (Example: Grandma finds it rewarding to see new pictures of my baby.  Facebook makes it easy for me to upload new pictures, and easy for her to view them, so she gets new pictures fairly often.  Therefore, Grandma is addicted.)",1267429947

A good way to do this is to add full fat milk to your diet (a liter of full fat milk is approximately ~700 kCal).  If you aren't gaining, eat more.

1158266,comment,1158034,1158140,0,0,mahipal,,,"Memorizing facts isn't innately valuable -- it's valuable because it makes critical thinking and problem solving easier. If you have a larger working memory (because you've memorized lots of things before), you'll be able to hold a larger system in your head to analyze.<p>Unfortunately, the educational system usually separates the memorization phase from the problem-solving phase far too much to establish the causal link. Using chemistry as an example, I think the (incorrect) reasoning runs something like this:<p>- Most good chemists know the periodic table by heart.<p>- Therefore, step 1 to being a good chemist is to memorize the entire periodic table.<p>They have the best of intentions -- every field requires you to know some basic concepts before you can start manipulating them. But when I took a math class in college, we didn't start off by memorizing the definitions of groups, rings, and fields. We just started doing proofs. Everyone learned the definitions fairly quickly just as a side effect of looking them up often enough to solve the problems. So the far better approach is just to memorize ""as needed,"" which also makes the memories more likely to stick around in the brain.<p>A final example, using history: Originally, I detested it as a subject solidly in the ""memorization"" category. But I finally got a teacher who forced it into the problem-solving category. Her exams were essays, where we had to write a position paper arguing for a specific side of a political debate. This immediately made those random memorized facts useful, because they could be brought in to support a larger conceptual argument. This teacher was somewhat of a local hero for her incredibly high passing rates -- her students actually learned history, while others merely memorized assorted facts.",1267429107

Though his book is more like a story telling with a bit of advice. If you're looking for a more ""scientific"" book, you should probably try ""Crucial Conversations"" and ""Influencer"" (both on amazon) - those are great books with a lot of useful information, which, by the way, support all of Carnegie points and extend them to a certain level.",1267427177

Bear in mind that agents you can send into a foreign country to participate in an assassination do not grow on trees, even if you're Israel.  This has not just impaired Mossad's supply of agents, it is also a blow to the morale of the organisation.<p>* These twenty five are at a real risk of reprisals in the years to come.  If a video of one of them turns up with a bag over their head this will do further damage to Israel's prestige and Mossad's morale.<p>* Worse still, the identities of foreign nationals have been stolen.  This has angered nations that <i>actually matter</i>, ie prosperous Western nations.  Israel is not in a strong geopolitical position, it relies on the goodwill of it's allies.<p>* The goal of the exercise, to eliminate a threat and strike fear into Israel's opponents, has been poorly accomplished.  It's caused Israel no end of diplomatic troubles and made it's victim a martyr.  Actually eliminating an arms dealer isn't much cause for celebration anyway as there's an almost endless supply of them.  You'll run out of wetwork teams long before they run out of arms dealers.<p>* Finally, footage of Israel's incompetence have been displayed on TVs all around the world.  You don't strike fear into the hearts of your enemies by cocking up repeatedly on TV.<p>Essentially, this was a political, not a military, operation, and it's failure has punished Israel politically.",1267426821

Not all good developers are commiters to open source projects and not all commiters are good developers. While I personally would love to contribute to some open source project I use, the area of work I am in makes it difficult to do so. When you freelance it is an additional burden to try to explain to customers that portions of the code you develop on their dime will get contributed to an open source project. Even if they are generic routines that have no direct benefit to the company other than getting the project done. Also given the fact that some of my clients are blue chip tech companies jumping through the legal hoops is a royal PITA. So in the end it is just easier for me to not be a contributor. I submit bug's, test cases, and suggestions but the requirement of my time to CYA myself so that I can contribute some code back kills my ability to do so. I have to imagine that their are a good deal of top caliber developers in the same boat. I think the point of whether someone contributes to an open source project is moot at best.",1288129066

It is important that we break free from the political propaganda that says that terrorism means a suicide bomber that kills others, and recognize that the basic concept of terrorism is used all the time by our own respective governments and other power figures.<p>I see it as terrorism when a religious leader tells people that they will go to hell for not following religious tenants.  I see it as terrorism when a government uses FUD on its own people to get them to support a war on another nation.<p>I also see it as a form of terrorism to take over someone's account and post something in their name. The average person who discovers that someone has hijacked their account and posted in their name is going to feel angry and afraid.<p>As far as I see it Idiocy and Firesheep can be used in the same manner as terrorism: to frighten people by threatening them. Sure the threat of taking over an online account is much less than the threat of death by a suicide bomb, but I see no reason why it should not be called terrorism.<p>Instead I find it fascinating that there is so much negative feelings toward me personally for using the word terrorism. Is it suddenly non-kosher to make a comparison? You say I am ""cheapening language skills"" and ""talking babble"". I am just surprised at your vehement response, and the general dislike of my use of the word.<p>I have a broad view of what terrorism is, you evidently have a very narrow view. If you do not want to broaden your view of what a terrorist act can be, then you will not notice the many subtle acts of terrorism committed. If people insist that terrorism can only be applied to acts of physical violence then they will be unaware of the way governments, political leaders, religious leaders, and others use fear to control the masses.<p>But the point of my comments originally were not to define terrorism, but instead to explain why I might disapprove of Idiocy. Instead it appears to have turned into a large discussion on whether or not it is right to use the word terrorism to describe something which scares someone into changing their actions or habits.<p>At any rate, downvotes do not hurt me, but I am disappointed by the narrow view of what the word terrorism means.",1288128387

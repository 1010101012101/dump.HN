9622445,story,,,5,7,zorba,"Ask HN: Side projects vs. day job beyond a day",,"I am a software engineer with over 15 years of industry experience. I mainly design/architect software now a days and as part of that write enough code so my team has something to go by. I am fluent in C#, JS, Python and not so fluent, but comfortable in Ruby (RoR), Lua, C++, Java. I have tried doing side projects but without much luck. Either I get bored or lose motivation to continue or both. However, I see myself putting in extra time towards my day job, work that extends beyond a day, completely voluntarily because I really enjoy it and there is an end goal, something achievable.<p>So the question becomes, am I doing this all wrong? Should I really put in the effort to disconnect from the day job at the end of each day and try to really focus on some side projects? Or should I really give my day job 100% even if that means going above and beyond a typical 8-9 hour day boundary? This is a quandary I have had for a while and I am not able to resolve it on my own. So I figure I would ask the collective wisdom. Dilemma is this: if I put in extra time and energy towards my day job, I would probably only get some recognition and may be a raise, but the latter would be a long shot. However, I know I can push our company&#x27;s tech limits if I did put in time outside of work hours and make us kick some ass out there. On the other hand, if I successfully get a side project of the ground, I might actually make some real side income. But again, historically I haven&#x27;t been able to do so.<p>I always wonder if other software engineers have such a dilemma or am I the only one and the rest of you guys are absolute clear about your priorities?",1432868228

flexible endpoint control over addressing, which got 
turned into a design (also by me) as &quot;source routing&quot; 
options, particularly &quot;loose source routing&quot;. It 
should have been the standard address, not an option, 
because the idea that a federated connection of 
autonomous networks gets to &quot;decide&quot; routing in a way 
that can&#x27;t be overridden by endpoints has made the 
network less scalable and more fragile than it need 
be. We lost because of an argument that &quot;addresses 
were too big&quot; for teletype packets, and the thought 
that 232 (4 billion) machines would NEVER be part of 
the Internet. (this also eliminated strong arguments 
made for longer, hierarchical addresses).&quot;<p>I am glad that my kernel still has a loose source routing compile option and that my #1 UDP client (and #2 TCP client, right after djb&#x27;s tcpclient) has source routing options.  That client is the orginal nc.<p>Those options do not get much use (yet) but they represent history I do not want to forget: what is being discussed in the blog post.<p>Apparently people did believe this was the way routing should be done; I like that thinking.  As I see it, assumptions were 1. user is not stupid and 2. user should be allowed at least some control.<p>Given a choice between the (theoretical) &quot;end-to-end&quot; internet and the (actual) third party &quot;policy-based&quot; routed internet, I would take the former.  But what do I know?  I&#x27;m just a dumb user.<p>Short of that, I&#x27;ll settle for an overlay with source routing.  UDP works well enough for making overlays, so thank you Mr. Reed.",1432868166

The Go team is not against generics per se, only against doing things that are not well understood and/or don&#x27;t work well with Go.<p>There are deep technical issues that must be solved to fit the idea of generics into Go in a way that works well with the rest of the system, and we don&#x27;t have solutions to those. I wrote on my blog about one issue years ago  (<a href=""http://research.swtch.com/generic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.swtch.com/generic</a>), but there are others too. Even supposing you get past the problem on that page, the next thing you would run into is how to allow programmers to omit type annotations in a useful, easy-to-explain way. As an example, C++ lets you write make_pair(1, &quot;foo&quot;) instead of make_pair<int, string>(1, &quot;foo&quot;), but the logic behind inferring the annotations takes pages and pages of specification, which doesn&#x27;t make for a particularly understandable programming model, nor something the compiler can easily explain when things go wrong. And then there&#x27;s a princess in another castle after that one I am sure.<p>We have spoken to a few true experts in Java generics and each of them has said roughly the same thing: be very careful, it&#x27;s not as easy as it looks, and you&#x27;re stuck with all the mistakes you make. As a demonstration, skim through most of <a href=""http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.ht...</a> and see how long before you start to think &quot;was this really the best way to do this?&quot; (For example, <a href=""http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/FAQSections/TypeParameters.html#FAQ106"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/FAQSections/TypePa...</a>, but note that the latter page is only one part of the FAQ, not the entire FAQ.)<p>To be very clear, we acknowledge this fact: there are definite disadvantages to not having generics. You either use interface{} and give up compile-time checking or you write code generators and complicate your build process. But there are also definite disadvantages to generics as implemented in existing languages, and there is a very large advantage to not compromising today: it makes adopting a better solution tomorrow that much easier.<p>As I said in the interview at <a href=""http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/2015/03/25/interview-with-gos-russ-cox-and-sameer-ajmani/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/2015/03/25/interview-with-gos-r...</a>:<p>> Go is more an engineering project than a pure research project. Like most engineering, it is fundamentally conservative, using ideas that are proven and well understood and will work well together. The research literature’s influence comes mainly through experience with its application in earlier languages. For example, the experience with CSP applied in a handful of earlier languages—Promela, Squeak, Newsqueak, Alef, Limbo, even Concurrent ML—was just as crucial as Hoare’s original paper to bringing that idea to practice in Go. Programming language researchers are sometimes disappointed that Go hasn’t picked up more of the recent ideas from the literature, but those ideas simply haven’t had time to pass through the filter of practical experience.<p>I believe generics is one of those ideas. It certainly needs at least one more iteration, possibly a few more than that.",1432867707

And, legislators have gotten <i>really good</i> at writing laws in such a way that you can suss out <i>any</i> intended effect you like, with enough wordplay. Combine that with an alliance between the national media and power brokers in government, and it&#x27;s basically impossible to figure what the fuck anyone in government is actually trying to <i>do</i>, much less whether you should support it or not.<p>So (proponents claim) the TPP and TISA and whatever else will give every signatory nation full employment for the next 35 years, and put a check on Chinese influence in Asia, and increase education standards, and progress culture at a rate of 11 Star Wars per month, and mow your lawn, and everyone will be farting through silk, etc etc. And so then we pass this shit sandwich, and none of that stuff happens, and then...<p>...well, tough luck!<p>There needs to be a <i>hard requirement</i>, as in baked into our constitutions, that new legislation be <i>explicitly coupled</i> to effects. We should not rely on our own interpretation of the proposed policies to figure it out - since ultimately the courts will interpret the law, not us. Nor should we rely on the word of the people supporting the new legislation since they are clearly biased. Rather, every new law ought to make a falsifiable claim what effects it will cause and by when. And, legislators ought to show (again, in the law itself) a reasonable chain of causes and effects that they think will bring about the intended result (so, no banning drinking on Sunday so that the Sun rises on Monday, for example). Then, if the claimed result is not achieved by the deadline agreed on, the law is <i>immediately and automatically repealed</i>. No Supreme Court, no public referendum - it just disappears from the books. We will need institutions similar in size and scope to our current justice system, to ensure that chains of causality baked into laws are reasonable, and that the claims they make regarding their intended effects are falsifiable.

Given the slow rate of diffusion of ideas at the time, it strikes me as just as likely that even if this idea is true and the Iliad was written by humans with a profoundly different psychology than ours, it was some peculiarity of Greek culture rather than a universal human condition. The spread of consciousness at this time in history can hardly occurred that quickly.</i><p>It didn&#x27;t. The very idea that Ancient Greeks didn&#x27;t have an inner self-consciouness (as proposed in the book) is invalid (even the article says so).<p>That said, what ancient civilizations didn&#x27;t have, and was developed culturally and through time, is the kind of complex self-introspection we have now.<p>In a way the Ancient Greeks (and other people) were more like James Stewart (straightforward and simple) than Woody Allen or Orson Wells (full of clashing thoughts, ideas about guilt, sin, self-introspection etc). Their inner thoughts they externalized to some degree (which is also the basis behind the book).

I still suspect you are getting lost in the UI. Specifically, I think you may have bought from Seller Y, which when you checked out specified was not Prime, and then when you went back to the same exact product page you saw Seller Z offering 2-day prime. I&#x27;ve seen lots of people get tripped up by the way Amazon displays multiple vendors selling the same product on the same page. Vendors will go back and forth competing on pricing, so often the &quot;main&quot; seller that&#x27;s listed on a product page will continuously switch among several sellers.",1432865470

9622322,comment,9619848,9622135,0,0,jasode,,,">Ace Hardware is a retailer-owned cooperative. Where the franchise board is owned by the member franchises.<p>The Ace Hardware franchise requires ~$1 million[1] in startup costs to open a store and be part of the &quot;co-op&quot;.  Most employees don&#x27;t have that kind of money and they don&#x27;t have the collateral to secure a $1 million loan from the bank.  When the ticket for admission into the &quot;co-op&quot; costs $1 million, that&#x27;s not the type of co-op people are discussing.   The REI stores co-op is also not a good example of what workers are thinking about.  REI is not employee-owned.<p>I think we need to level-set.  When threads pop up about cooperatives, the driving sentiment is from typical workers/employees who don&#x27;t like the corporate ownership structure (founder has equity worth millions/billions, and/or CEO is drawing $500,000+ salary, etc).<p>Therefore, the co-op structure where all employees are also the owners and share the profits looks very attractive.  The problem is it will end up being a modest business.  E.g. a cooperative of IT consultants.  The IT Consultants Co-Op don&#x27;t need members to contribute $1 million each to capitalize the business; they just start billing clients right away. They can pool their modest funds from their hourly billings to buy the shared office a laser printer and a coffee machine.<p>It would be great if a cutting edge big company (like Google, Amazon, or SpaceX) with ambitious and very expensive goals (driverless cars, drone delivery, Mars colony)  could be &quot;employee-owned&quot; but it can&#x27;t.  Employees don&#x27;t have the money.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.franchisechatter.com/2013/08/31/franchise-costs-2013-detailed-estimates-of-ace-hardware-franchise-costs-2013-fdd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.franchisechatter.com/2013/08/31/franchise-costs-2...</a>",1432865005

At its rawest form open source just means that you are going to share the source code.<p>If a business is big enough that they have staff who can integrate your open source project would they have been a customer of yours anyway? And if they arent going to be a customer, why not have them as a tester and potential contributor?

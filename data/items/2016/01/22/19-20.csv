At least looking at the map before and after - it lost everything on the continent, incl. last remnants of Angevin and Normandy lost to France, with France rising up significantly bigger and stronger as a result of the war.<p>While long bow is a nice nostalgic weapon, the crossbow is technologically more advanced, and in our civilization technology wins :<p>&quot;Plate armor that could be penetrated by large crossbows, but was impenetrable by longbows, was uncommon in Europe until about 1380&quot;<p>(funny that while a child i was initially making bows, yet soon switched to making crossbows - and they were interesting until i made my first single shot handgun at the end of the 1st grade :)",1453492791

When you went to development your customer was no longer the end user but the business unit. It is their job to determine what the end user needs. Your job is to ensure business gets what they want.

10955177,comment,10953766,10954783,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"High-assurance security approaches on separation/MILS kernels have been doing this successfully for years. It&#x27;s common for those RTOS&#x27;s to have a native target on microkernel, a safety-critical runtime for Ada/Java, a featured runtime for them, a POSIX layer, user-mode Linux... all containing pieces of the system or even an application working together through robust middleware.<p>So, it&#x27;s a proven model that&#x27;s literally flying through the air right now due to aerospace take-up. It would likely work for unikernels, too, so long as they included same checks/mediation at interface points or middleware that prior model required. The only real questions should be about the resulting attributes of that system: is it a good approach vs regular unikernels w/ performance, containment, etc (theory vs practice)? Or just ditch them to enhance separation kernels, micro-hypervisor platforms, or capability systems?<p>Personally, I&#x27;m not sold on unikernels for resilience: prior, security models were better, field-proven, and survived advanced pentesting. Under-utilized imho. Cross-language is similar in both, though, with attributes of one application likely carrying to other. The real problem is the TCB being complex & insecure, breaking isolation paradigm.",1453492762

Given the complexity of the PC, and the number of critical Xen/KVM/... vulnerabilities, it certainly isn&#x27;t trivial to emulate securely.<p>Xen has their own priorities and I have my views on their code quality. The interface is that much smaller that it should be much more possible to implement securely than the unix API (which isn&#x27;t even well-defined). People elsewhere are talking about seL4; I hope we&#x27;ll one day see a formally verified hypervisor. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever see a formally verified unix container.<p>In the long run you&#x27;re right, there&#x27;s ultimately no difference between compiling my OCaml to a binary that runs on a secure formally verified microkernel and building it into a unikernel that runs on a secure formally verified hypervisor. But I can take steps towards the latter now - I can deploy unikernel systems to EC2 today, and while they may not be more secure than deploying processes to Joyent today, they&#x27;re using an interface that should make it possible to run them on a more secure environment.",1453492691

When people want to borrow my car, they just want to get from A to B. Worst thing that can happen is they spill their Starbucks or they&#x27;re a little too hard on the throttle and they burn up my full tank of gas.<p>When they want to borrow my truck, they want to haul things with it. When you&#x27;re hauling with someone else&#x27;s truck, weigh limits don&#x27;t matter because transmissions don&#x27;t usually fail spectacularly the first time you haul 3000 lbs over the towing limit. Frames don&#x27;t get bent and shocks don&#x27;t get blown the first time you load the bed down with 500 lbs too many cinder blocks. What&#x27;s the tongue weight limit on your friend&#x27;s truck?

We&#x27;ve tried a few partnerships with outside delivery services and it never worked out because they were never able to replicate the very high standards of service that we require (coming from a background in hospitality management myself). I know there are all these companies purporting to be the &quot;Uber for weed&quot;, but that&#x27;s not really that accurate. If Uber were doing the same thing as these other startups in transportation, then the proper parallel would be Uber partnering with existing Taxi companies rather than independent drivers. Uber cuts out an established middle-man, but the other on-demand marijuana startups are partnering with established middle-men rather than cutting them out of the value chain.<p>However, I think the single biggest reason to go in-house is that services like Eaze/Meadow can never compete with us on price. I consider our prices to be somewhat high right now, since our cash flow is still so fragile, yet we are still undercutting Eaze by around 20% on most products even as they have over $11 million in funding.",1453492060

So then I updated to a new snapshot (14AUG2015?), and a previous dependency would no longer compile (since it hadn&#x27;t been updated). I think this could have been due to libc changes, which I guess were marked unstable (and this was the result of them being removed from the main rustc distribution?). I did some manual tweaking, and/or the problem fixed itself in a few days.<p>I next came back to rust a few months later, where after that experience, I went ahead and updated to the 1.4 release. I figured libraries should generally aim to keep working with numbered releases, regardless of the upgrade treadmill. I guess (in your framework) that&#x27;s applying unstable expectations to numbered releases, which is what I&#x27;ve been doing this whole thread - I don&#x27;t care that code will break at future point, but I do desire consistency in the meantime!<p>I was next surprised to find out that the syntax extensions for eg serde were used completely differently with the numbered releases because procedural macros were disabled (I hadn&#x27;t yet touched my own projects that use procedural macros or libcore).<p>The snapshot story is probably better these days, given that <i>libraries</i> should be more stable. It has always been annoying feeling like my rust is continually &quot;out of date&quot; and dependencies could break and require me to update, involuntarily breaking my code. This has been a problem all along, and I had hoped it was over with numbered releases. Alas.<p>From my perspective the main source of pain is that rust eschews having traditional numbered <i>unstable</i> releases. Instead creating a harsh dichotomy between uber-stable releases and uber-changing snapshots. One can alleviate some of that pain only if they&#x27;re willing to take the web 2.0 give-up-control-of-your-computing plunge and run eg rustup.sh, which of course helps the fundamental problem to persist. Granted, the problem will be moot as rust libraries become more stable and the stable distribution becomes more featureful. We&#x27;re apparently just not there yet for my purposes.",1453491909

ARR per customer (department) is ~$9k.<p>3) 50-100% MoM growth for the past 6 months.

Innovation is in the business model — avoid RFPs, find one decision maker, lower CAC with growth through referrals — which means our growth engine is exactly the same as startups in other sectors.<p>5) Per-user recurring subscription. Right now $40/user/month, lots of room for expansion there.<p>6) Founders were early engineers at Gusto, so we know how to bring delightful products to unsexy problems and build a mission-driven culture.

So, thanks to your comment, I looked up a bunch of CompSci and stuff on asynchronous verification to see what old and cutting edge methods are. Looks like it&#x27;s a mostly solved problem at the conceptual level. Even found a method from NASA for Globally-Asynchronous, Locally-Synchronous (GALS) which I keep stumbling into in hardware.<p>So, good news, there&#x27;s a number of techniques for various aspects of this at a range of mathematical abilities. Might be able to make an informal, knock-off of one or more for your use case. The bad news is that I found more papers than I wanted to thoroughly read. Not filtering them myself. If you want, I&#x27;ll drop you a link to an archive or links to individual papers for you to skim at your own pace. If not, that&#x27;s cool too as I needed them in my collection anyway for high-assurance, asynchronous systems. Especially given all the uptake on async in mainstream.<p>So, it was great you replied with those details regardless.

(Actually, non-thread-safe GC doesn&#x27;t either, not by a long shot, but it won&#x27;t show up in small benchmarks as easily.)<p>- Just being able to allocate on the stack is not enough. You need to be able to freely make pointers to those stack objects. The ways to do that are to either (a) accept the lack of safety and admit dangling pointers; (b) use an imprecise escape analysis; (c) lifetimes and borrowing. Every choice has costs.<p>- Safety with runtime checks is not equivalent to what Rust does. Rust provides the safety without runtime checks. That yields better performance than safety with checks.<p>I&#x27;m not intending to spread FUD about Nim specifically. The more interesting question is whether it&#x27;s possible to have a safe language with the same performance as C/C++ without any cognitive overhead.

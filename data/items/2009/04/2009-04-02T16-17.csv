[2] And I believe you can even use Comcast's trademarks in the process, so long as you do so for the purpose of commentary (and not, say, to compete with Comcast in the cable business), and so long as there isn't evidence that you're misleading people into thinking that your site is officially associated with Comcast.<p>P.S.

GS should have had an e-mail notification system in place. They should notify any company, much less 37Signals, that there's been a question posted on their forums. Same can be said for UserVoice and any other third-party site who wants to get into this game. Had they notified the support people at 37Signals, none of this would have come to bear.<p>2. Jason, no matter how angry he is/was, should have NOT used a public forum for dealing with this issue immediately. Had he talked to GS's admins/support through e-mail privately, there'd be no need for this hubbub. If the e-mail route did not work, then I agree with denouncing GS publicly.<p>All I'm alluding to here is maturity. There are good ways of handling issues and then there are bad ones.

And there's some truth to that. The more people advertise, the more people get bored. So excitement becomes the only thing that matters.<p>Until my current project I always thought that excitement was something that you simulated to get users. The guy who built and marketed Zoints, the start-up I did work for in high school, would IM me and talk about these campaigns he wanted to run on forums where Zoints employees would become forum members to talk about how much they loved the network (it was a social network for forums, essentially). And I thought, Oh, this is how you generate excitement. Then I started demoing Cirqueti to people in January, and suddenly I was getting absolutely ridiculous feedback. Things like, I'd talk to somebody about it on IM, and they would go to their college and talk to their professor or their class about it. One guy keeps bringing friends onto his IM account to ask me questions about it.<p>It's <i>insane</i>, and it's a terrific feeling, and more than that it's genuine. I love it, because it means I don't have to lie or oversell what I've got: from the initial reaction it doesn't at all look like that'll be necessary, and I can focus on just making it better. And the best part of that is it's <i>not</i> marketing. Like, this isn't some cynical attempt to gain users. It's much more honest, because they're doing it on their own. I've seen that with a lot of web sites, in particular Facebook, which ran no ads on competing web sites (unlike TagWorld, which people thought was a big potential competitor, and which would advertise everywhere). I love it. It shows that if you've <i>actually made something good</i>, then you don't have to worry about advertising and you can just be yourself and do your own thing.",1238690553

Thus, Nesson has no incentive to artificially shorten the length of his defense (out of concern for working longer than his client can afford).<p>Nesson also wants to win this case.<p>So you've got someone for whom: time is no real object, and winning is a goal.<p>In that circumstance, what's the harm in trying a ""fair use"" defense? It probably won't fly, but it's one more thing to try, and one more thing for the plaintiff to have to argue against (thereby further draining plaintiff's resources, because plaintiff <i>is</i> paying for their representation's time here).<p>It's not entirely harmless, sure -- a few too many wild conjectures and Nesson's credibility in court may be somewhat tarnished (though, even there, keep in mind Nesson's (1) something of a legend and (2) already known as a loose cannon, so compared to a run of the mill attorney the impact of one or two wild arguments on his in-courtroom credibility is harder to calculate) -- but it's one more thing that <i>might</i> work and it's one more way to try and exhaust the plaintiff's will to proceed (and I guarantee you this is not the only line of defense Nesson's got).<p>So, regardless of whether (1) Nesson thinks file-sharing is actually fair use and (2) Nesson thinks he can convince anyone else file-sharing is actually fair use (note: (2) is independent of (1)) it's possible to reverse-engineer the thinking that might make the risk/reward calculation on advancing this line of argument look promising.<p>But, due to the practical constraints of legal speech, you'll never see any of these statements:<p>- your honor, I personally don't think file sharing is fair use and I actually don't think I'll be able to convince anyone else in this courtroom that filesharing is fair use, but in the interest of exhausting my opponents with every hare-brained scheme I can conceive I'm going to spend a couple days arguing the point. Let's proceed.<p>- your honor, I personally think file sharing is fair use and am savvy enough to understand I won't convince anyone here of that via any amount of argumentation, but I am cocksure enough of my argumentative abilities that I won't say anything so immediately laughable that all y'all will be hard-pressed to give a reasoned explanation for why you should shut this line of argumentation down prematurely so you should plan on hearing me out over the next several days.<p>...or anything similarly candid, ever. Instead, you'll just hear something like what you've heard, which is a straight-faced assertion with no qualifications or caveats; it might be more honest to give a statement like one of the impossible statements above, but giving the statement such a form would be self-defeating in light of the intended effect of making any such statement.",1238689924

It's, for all practical purposes, inexhaustible. So trying to put a price on a collection of bits is virtually impossible using classical models.<p>So what you end up with is companies trying to recreate this 'scarcity' with encryption schemes and lockins and all manner of other protective measures. Which all inevitably fail, rendering the production cost of this new item extremely close to zero.<p>Now, some people argue that you must take development costs into account, lost sales, etcetera and then you end up straying into wild, untamed territory. After all, you don't see car companies suing the manufacturers of bicycles for taking away sales, or anything like that. But yet, when it comes to digital information, this seems to be par for the course.<p>And of course, the counter-argument to it is thus: If I make say, 1,000 copies of a game and keep all these copies on my hard drive, does that cost the company more? No.<p>But if I give these new copies that I made at my own expense (as little as that is) to my friends, this is somehow a transformative process and is treated as costing the IP owner profit (or increasing effective cost or somesuch).<p>It would probably serve better to just give up on this and focus on creating product in a way that follows traditional markets.

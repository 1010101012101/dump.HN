Failing that, you'll ideally have a sense of aesthetic in relation to design both as an interface and as art.<p>- Your idea of retirement doesn't involve Social Security.<p>In return you'll get a sizable chunk of equity and plankowner status within the company.<p>Here's a handy form to fill out.

I would rather get diluted by a low valuation than have a company take money at such a high one that there's no room for error.",1184074192

1005178,comment,1005037,1005144,0,0,unalone,,,"Really? I have the exact opposite reaction. Every development in OS X has made itself more subtle. Gradients are lighter, windows are softer... The unified 10.5 theme got rid of what I felt was a kitschy plastic feel in the system, and it created a much more intuitive menu set-up where buttons are a part of the top bar. 10.6 takes steps even further — I love the new Dock menus and hope that's the standard from which Apple develops its new look. Some things moved backwards — the new iTunes got <i>more</i> gradient-y and that's an issue — but in general Apple's design is growing more and more subtle.<p>The default backgrounds are a little silly, yes, but I think when we look back we'll view it like we view 60s typography — perhaps a bit gaudier than we needed, but it was done in a sense of fun rather than a sense of self-importance.

The version they recovered still has issues. I tried using it to get my 14-year-old brother into Ruby, and there was too many bugs for him to smoothly guide through it. But at the same time, I know nothing of _why's decision to remove it, and I won't pretend like I know one so that I can bash him. If one day he returns and explains himself and I find him wanting, then I'll criticize him, but I'm not going to spew hate in his direction even if I do.<p>I'm simply grateful for all the things he gave the community, no strings attached. If the day he'd gone we never saw any of his work again, he'd still have made me a better person, inspired me to try things I'd never done. Beyond that he never had a responsibility to me and so I'm not angry. Hell, I'm still discovering new things of his — the music from his old band is playing through on iTunes now, and it's inspired stuff. (I could further the comparison by saying that Zed writes a lot about practicing guitar, but the music he's made is derivative; _why's music is haphazard and amateur but it evokes something. But that's not fair to Zed.)<p>As I said, I respect some things about Zed, and if he didn't spend his time being an arse to other people I'd respect him a lot more. But all the time he spends being negative really irks me, especially when it's targeted towards one of the most positive people in the community he left so violently.",1261255952

The one really nice thing about their setup is the management console that makes deploying whichever distro you want really easy and then monitoring really easy.<p>Also as Jaddison said, they have some a really solid community and the support is excellent.",1261253723

Wasn't the entire point of that book that the way science is sold to kids, ie, a linear process where one good idea comes out and naturally replaces another, was a complete fable?

Almost all propositions put forth by science are ultimately incompletely, inaccurate in some cases, or limited to specific situations we can test.<p>So, the scientific process (and the method itself) rigorously challenge all propositions. Some simply fall apart under the weight of their own inconsistency, which is what happens when results can not be replicated. But those which can be replicated <i>achieve consensus</i> until a more accurate proposition can be made.<p>Thusly, Newtonian physics was supplemented and updated by Relativity. Wave-particle duality gradually replaced competing theories. Et cetera. These are <i>consensus</i> opinions. They are <i>not</i> facts. They're the closest models we can get based off our observations. The core of the scientific method is that things are given a continuous opportunity to be <i>falsified</i>.",1261253097

Then recursion and higher-order functions. That is four things. (Macros can be considered advanced). In the end, all functions evaluates to a value. Thus functions are considered to be data. This value (data) is then passed on to the next function as arguments, and so on.. Anonymous functions is also something which kicks ass, and you miss such features when programming in C. This is one reason why C programs should be left as simple as possible, with as little abstraction as possible. (Fortran? Come on!)",1261253002

""Here's something poignant to get you started."" It's a story about a dog who he found and adopted, named Bigelow, only to lose him right away.</i><p><i>In chapter 5, the narrator reveals that he is a Preeventualist. Preeventualism seems like a fairly new philosophical doctrine, asserting that the nature of all predictive thought is optimistic -- even dystopian futures are ""optimistically"" predicted to come true. Therefore preeventualists just ""focus... on the understanding that hope will always prevail in any sort of thought"". I'd never heard of preeventualism before, but it made sense that someone on the cutting edge of Internet programming would also be on the cutting edge of philosophical discourse. And it was cutting edge -- no wikipedia articles, no podcasts, nothing. Just one page of actual information on the preeventualist homepage, and that shout-out in the Poignant Guide.</i><p><i>But it's a pretty compelling philosophy on the face of it, and they have a preeventualist youth group responsible for maintaining the web page (which is probably why it went down with such frequency). You can see other examples of preeventualist thought if you know what you're looking for: Anathem is pretty preeventualist, and if you start to think seriously about Long-Now style timescales I bet you'll become somewhat preeventualist yourself. (You'll start to mix up words like ""molding"" and ""embroidery"".) And of course there's always Ashley Raymond's blog, which sadly doesn't get updated at all. In fact, there's only the one entry, in which Ashley Raymond talks about his time with his dog, whom he called Biggles, whose ""accusatory gaze often hinted at how wrong my pronounciation must have been"".</i><p><i>Wait. Biggles? Bigelow?</i><p><i>So I did a whois on preeventualist.net, and sure enough, it was registered to _why the Lucky Stiff. Conclusion: the dude FABRICATED AN ENTIRE PHILOSOPHY FOR A THROWAWAY JOKE IN HIS STUPID BOOK. And it wouldn't be so stunning except that I BECAME a preeventualist in the time between discovering the philosophy and discovering that it was ""fake"" (if such a thing can be said of an idea).</i>",1261252844

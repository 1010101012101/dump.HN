They had organized parties all over California as they thought they were going to die in some days as the Earth would be finished. And so it was better to have fun, make confessions etc. So there.<p>Coming back. \nWell don't you think there's a difference between 1910 and now? \nIf you move the clock back a little. I think witches were pretty common in America and Europe (and related hysteria in towns and cities where they were ""located"") too don't you think? Or take the hysteria after the launch of the Sputnik. People thought they were just going to be bombed every second day.<p>And suicides weren't because it was said Halleys' tail had cyanide.\nIt was because of this: Comets have had a history IN ALL cultures to invoke some sort of fear. The only difference is that there are still a lot of people in Eastern countries who are backward. That's the only difference. In Europe not very long ago, comets could lead to executions. In places like India and China there are still a lot of people who hold on to such beliefs that the gods are angry.<p>And when I said about culture I meant that there are hundreds of cultures and such rituals are more prevalent in some of them than the others. So generalizing would be a sin.<p>About flu. I have not been to America since the outbreak of the flu so I can't say. I think in India and China some of it is necessary. A lot of people live in slums, and these are more likely to catch the virus once it has spread. Right now it is confined to people who came in touch with people coming from abroad. \nIf there isn't a certain degree of hysteria, there could be catastrophe when these poor people start getting it.<p>And I agree with your point about the media created frenzy, but I again believe that it's the same in all countries if you normalize.",1250085150

I am in the same spot as the author right now, and the thing that really gets to me is that I have to fake being an extrovert in order to connect with other people. It isn't really that hard (it's just acting), but it is really draining when it shouldn't be.<p>The ideal way to interact would be to be able to be myself while still managing to spark some openness and life in my conversational counterpart. After all, most deep wants are somehow achievable, and there isn't any obvious reason why it should be impossible to connect with other people if you happen to hate smalltalk and often enjoy being alone.<p>The definition of introvert is <i>not requiring that much external social stimulation</i>, not <i>hating to interact with other people.</i>",1250085120

Chile: Government, (CORFO, specifically) helps out a lot with grants even for off the wall tech startups, something I dont see in the U.S., however, it is expensive compared to its neighbors, but living costs are at around $800/mo comfortably (no dependents)<p>2. Argentina: Amazing and large tech community with presedence, tech Angels and VCs, lots of tech and startup meet ups and events. Most, if not all the main tech startups have come out of Argentina. Great talent. Day to day living costs are more expensive than Chile.<p>3. Colombia: Best bang for your buck, more business friendly, extremely good engineering talent that is very affordable, easy cultural fit and work ethic. However, not a lot of tech startup presedence and capital.

In the U.S. it takes 1 or 2 days, $70, to incorporate an LLC, whereas in Latin America it can take from a week in chile to over 175 days in venezuela.<p>• Most countries demand that you have an actual physical office, killing the option of work from home/garage.<p>• There is correlation between the time it takes to incorporate and the corruption of a country.",1250083855

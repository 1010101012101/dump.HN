My vivid recollection when I worked in Japan was ""These people are so nice outside the office, why do they become such expressionless robots inside?""  I have many close friends in Japan (and we have done a lot of fun stuff outside the office), and so I would ask them this. They would shrug and say ""At work we have to wear a mask, that is just the culture here, everyone has to conform to it."" It felt oppressive to me, but they seem to take it in their stride.",1248191890

We had known each other for a while, but it didn't work because we had different goals and approaches at the time. He wanted to build a world changing product and focus on that from the get go. I would have loved to do that but wanted to start with building something small that was useful and build up on that. Thankfully we realized this fast and parted amicably.<p>I was incredibly lucky the second time. I found and recruited someone who is attending the same school I did, but who I didn't know, mainly because he is a great programmer and a frank person. In our first meeting he was direct about everything ranging from his motivation to his weaknesses as a coworker and he expected the same of me. We have now become good friends but in the interim this transparency served as an effective substitute.<p>In the past year there have been multiple occasions where one of us has felt like the startup is below the X axis.

You probably want to find out for sure or inquire about other licensing options. Since you'd be dealing directly with the developer it may be negotiable.<p>Boogie Tools isn't going to require you to release source code, but they've got the typical annoying licensing scheme with multiple versions and usage levels. It looks like they have separate licenses for different operating systems as well. I don't see anything about a trial license.",1248189095

716353,comment,716110,716110,0,0,huherto,,,"A guy who works at Foxconn here in Mexico told me that Chinese executives that come here are surprised and somehow annoyed but the difference in cultures. Here, people come to work, talk to each other, joke around, etc. In China, people just stay in one place, do not talk to each other and just look straight down even if the line is stopped and they don't have work to do. It sounds like one of those futuristic movies where we are just robots doing the same thing over and over. I do not know if they are repressed or if it is pure fear. I guess that can make you crazy. I know that he (Sun) was an engineer and it is not exactly the same, but still I can imagine a situation where he was extremely scared.",1248189067

He also misses the fact that Cabinet has real master-to-master replication.<p>Redis' batch-disk-dumping-from-memory strategy is interesting and theoretically allows it memcached speed with persistance.

A business supports these methods every time they sign a contract with a company that produces its goods in China.  It's implicit.  I am not sure how you can feign having your head in the sand.  Apple is absolutely part of the problem.  We are absolutely part of the problem.  Yes, even myself.  To say otherwise is foolish.

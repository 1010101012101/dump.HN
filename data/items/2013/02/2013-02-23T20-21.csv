You are going to have a chicken and egg problem, I don't know if you've attempted this solution yet but you can lower the adoption friction of new users by letting them tweet. Then you can use the twitter api to, say, find all of the tweets with the #shoutt hashtag and process them. This way you can make use the the massive platform that is Twitter and users don't even need to signup or install an app.<p>Good luck.",1361653196

For example, in the cocktail sauce that is often served with shrimp in the U.S.<p>Using it as a general purpose, ""broad spectrum"" hot sauce is a mistake.<p>Actually, the Tabasco brand has a habanero sauce that is not just habanero pepper but a combination of flavors, that I much prefer for more general use (when choosing from amongst their products).  In addition to the balance of flavors, the ""pepper"" flavor of the habanero is much more enjoyable in it than is the pepper flavor, of itself, in their traditional Tabasco Sauce.",1361653174

When, our history often guides us to be both helpful to and suspicious of Europe and its goals.<p>Most Americans have no particular issue with the UK or Great Britain, we simply recall our history as having been formed to offer an alternative to Monarchy. We do often feel that in the 20th century, we have given more than we have received.  (Right or wrong.)<p>While some far-left-leaning Americans may long for a country more like those of Europe and the UK, the majority, in my experience, prefer things as they are. Notably, our culture may seem aggressive, dangerous, and out of control to you - but to us, we see a stark difference between what we see as ""Liberty,"" and what Europeans tend to call ""Freedom.""  That is to say, it often seems to me that in the US, the concept is ""Free to,"" whereas in Europe it appears to be ""Free of."" I do recognize that such a view may not be wholly truthful, but it is how many of us approach the issue here.<p>Notably, while some in our society would prefer to regulate the behavior of others through the threat of state violence (as is done in Europe to prevent unwelcome speech, or religious display), this tyranny of the masses is often held in check in the U.S. by the guiding principles which may seem absurd to you, but have proven to be effective throughout the course of our personal history.  There are many of us who find those principles very much instructive, especially because of the discomfort they cause.",1361652537

Further:<p>- I'm going to take it on your word that 'history of violent crime' means beating up random homeowners. I can only imagine in the business of housebreaking and fencing stolen goods you probably have some extra-judicial problem solving, which might involve beating up other people you've had criminal dealings with. This is quite different from murdering suburban homeowners in cold blood.<p>- Further, of course they had crowbars, they were housebreaking. The police didn't catch them at your house, so you can't really confirm the number or the kit they had at the time, just how many people the cops nabbed later.<p>The really telling thing is your comment about hand-to-hand combat.

There will be deeper levels of abstraction, and the OS, for the most part, will do a marvelous job hiding it, but without a strong understanding of assembly you'll never be able to work on things like memory management, efficiency algorithms, and so forth. For example, assembly forces you to think in terms of bits, so knowing word-aligned vs non word-aligned code can make drastic differences in speed. Also, knowing how 64-bit is different from 32-bit makes a world of difference. Assembly forces you to think in those contexts.<p>For the most part, the average programmer today already does not need to know assembly. But if you want to work on other low-level aspects of code (or optimize your code for efficiency), knowledge of assembly is critical. You might not have to write very much assembly, but things like context-switching that happens on the CPU level (e.g kernel land vs user land) can only be done by sending the right instructions to the CPU.",1361651992

Someone who has to be able to grab a handful of mail out of their bag and perform a quick visual check that yes, everything in this bundle actually goes to this address. Someone who might have a hundred bundles destined for an apartment building, and would like to be able to quickly parse the addresses to put them into the proper mailbox instead of having to type a long, cryptic ID into a smartphone, and hope they continue to have connectivity.<p>Any proposed new addressing system also needs to deal with the fact that the postal service serves EVERYONE. Even people way out in the middle of nowhere who have no cellular service. The ONLY processing power available to those mail carriers is their own brain, so it pretty much HAS to be human-readable.<p>All of the things you complain about in the address are USEFUL redundancy. Including all of that stuff makes it more likely that mail will get to its destination in the event of the ink being smeared (or running due to being rained on). It's more data that's useful in error correction.<p>Also, if you are mailing out many things and hate copying the info manually, let me introduce you to a concept called ""printable address labels"" and ""mail merge"". I recently had to mail out about a hundred books after a successful Kickstarter; I manually addressed maybe three of them. I put books in mailing envelopes, put the labels on the envelopes, sealed them shut, and brought them to the post office. They figured out how much it would cost me to mail them.

Can they spot mistakes? Recognize patterns? Read and write code? Does the candidate know the ecosystem well enough to suggest methods or libraries?<p>Most importantly, pairing tells us whether or not the candidate can communicate effectively. Are they terrified to offer suggestions, or overly arrogant and controlling? Can they explain clearly? Do they clarify when the other half of the pair doesn't understand?<p>For example, many moons ago, I did some pairing with a candidate that gave me a suggestion on how I could make a section of my code both smaller and easier to read by combining a couple of iterators in an obvious way that I hadn't noticed. We ended up hiring that guy.<p>The getting-up-to-speed part happens as they pair, with a lot of explanation happening as they work on the system, and it's another important part of seeing how they work -- can the candidate understand new concepts quickly? Do they stop and ask questions when they don't understand?<p>This type of interview <i>is</i> a performance hit for that employee for the day, but this is fine, as I consider hiring to be very important, and losing a day or two of engineering time over the course of a month is a price I'm willing to pay -- keep in mind that the phone screens eliminate a <i>lot</i> of people.<p>Admittedly, I've never had a day when my guys didn't have work to do, but not all interviews involved the company codebase.<p>I make it a point to carve space out for my team to do miniature research projects, in a fashion similar to the way HP used to work, or Google's ""20% time"". These are timeboxed, and at the end, the result needs to be made available to the team; and yes, ""this didn't work because of X and Y"" is totally acceptable.

It was just every now and then I'd hit some make script or gem compile that didn't work and drove me batty.<p>I hope my post didnt come across that you cant do _anything_ with cygwin or brew.  I just ran into enough issues that like OP all I wanted was to sit down and work and that pointed me to bare metal linux.  Later after being frustrated by the desktop environments I found pleasure in having Windows manage my windows (as well as all the windows only apps) and let linux run in a VM that all I needed from it was a shell.<p>So as long as my VM is running in the background I can click a shell icon in my quick launch bar that lives right next to command prompt, putty connection manager, and github's git shell (which I use for projects that are win based and dont need a vm, like some .net).  The shell is just like cygwin only you are limited to what you share on samba (or vmware folder share if you use that)",1361649823

You'd be adding another layer of complexity to an already simple system of names and addresses on a designed letter carrier's route.

Then the article's first line had Google misspelt as 'Gogle' and then there were a few paragraphs with too many biased assumptions and with more of marketing slogans revolved around the importance of '<i>you</i>'..and so I thought it's a social network with a search engine integrated. But then, I thought ""hey, isn't that what Google already does?""<p>And then I clicked the link, it's just a semi-polished front-end, with serif and sans-serif fonts mixed, that just builds-up queries for ONE particular search engine (Bing). Atleast, if there was an option to choose between any of the top 3 Search engine's, I would have been slightly impressed.<p>Honestly, this is a disappointment and the title is misleading.<p>It solves a very little problem.

I don't find using it to be terribly productive for work purposes (especially as a data warehouse consultant).  I realize that some people have, and that's great, but for me it doesn't fit the bill.<p>So what I use it for is when I specifically want to ensure I can't work.  I grab it, I go into the sitting area of my bedroom (away from dual 27"" display setup), and do things that are very much ""not work"" in my lounge chair.  I might check on my finances.  I might play some games.  I might browse a few sites, catch up on them with something like Reeder, or read old articles with Instapaper.  I watch my subscribed channels on YouTube.  Perhaps check the weather.  Perhaps do some shopping, catch up on Twitter, or maybe check Facebook to see what friends are prattling on about.  If it's late, it'll get perched on a nightstand and I'll play some podcasts, stream a movie or TV show, or put something on from YouTube and fall asleep to that.<p>I could do that on my iMac + display as well, but then I might get sucked into doing actual work, which I want to avoid.  I'm not going to work on large database apps or ETL processes on my iPad.  I'm not going to code effectively on my iPad.  It's suboptimal for it.  So I relish in that fact and it's my ""coffee table computer"" or my ""fun computer"".  And for that, it does a great job, mostly in ensuring I stay away from ""doing work"" when I don't want to be working.  Overall, it ends up being about 30-35% of my ""total computing"" time, but at least all of that time is 100% leisure instead of constantly straying back towards work.",1361649651

As people have pointed out already, no legislature can bind a future version of itself (which is why the 60-vote filibuster is unconstitutional, but I digress).<p>Congress could establish better customs, of course.  It is customary in many nations to limit legislation to a single topic and to codify the laws on a single topic in a single published Act.  For example, virtually all of the important laws relating to, say, education, might be published in an Education Act, and from time to time, a legislature would enact a new version of it, replacing the old version entirely.<p>This tends to make reading up on the laws (and proposed laws) much easier, and it also makes super-specific tax breaks for individual companies and things like that really stand out.<p>The U.S. custom of publishing bills as a list of ""replace ""and"" in line 76422 with ""or"""" statements is a really poor legislative custom.",1361649636

I understand that they are renting memorable IP addresses, and I understand that Google is running the DNS service out of the datacenter. I didn't say anything to the contrary.<p>What I meant by Level3 hosting it is... Level3 is likely the single ISP in front of this service. I don't think Google can get away with multihoming this, other ISPs are just going to push 8.8.8.8 packets to Level3. I don't know how routing tables work, but I don't think they can reliably advertise ownership of the 8.8.8.* block considering it is wholly contained by another block.",1259906255

Farm Town said for months (and still probably does to this day) ""Notify me when myr crops are ready."" They misspelled a two letter word. Didn't stop them from getting 30m users.

For example, if all your internal URLs in a document are //domain/whatever, that is they don't specify a protocol, then the page is completely viewable on both HTTP and HTTPS protocols without having the browser indicate mixed security contexts.  Without the double leading slashes indicating the hostname, you'd be unable to recognize that a URL is relative to the protocol vs relative to the dirname of the current document.  In the same way, http:/file fills in the hostname from the current base URL.<p>TLDs don't really mean much technically, they were created for human consumption.  There may be load balancing issues that are made easier because of TLDs, but it's not technically a requirement.  On your own name server, you can create a zone that ends with anything (try it).<p>There have been recurring attempts/suggestions to get rid of TLDs, somewhat as a response to the needlessly ever-expanding TLD list, and somewhat as a response to break up the monopoly that exists in determining them (""If only more people could make their own TLDs, the world would be a better place, woes is us!"").  More TLDs mean more costly trademark enforcement and continual attempts to corral different kinds of services/websites into predictable naming schemes (.xxx, .sex, .travel, .biz, and the super-stupid .tel, .name, and .mobile) -- people have specifically been against .xxx or .sex TLDs with the argument that it would be easier to convince law/policy makers to <i>force</i> people to use them for adult sites and thus limit free speech, for one example.<p>I don't really mind TLDs, I'm not convinced that lack of TLDs would be any kind of significant win.  In the same vein, I don't like San Francisco's apparently random street numbering scheme and fake grid system (random streets that run for a block start at 0, no matter what the surrounding addresses are, or a single block is bounded by different address ranges (check out the block that Sanchez Elementary School is on <a href=""http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=San+Francisco,+California&ll=37.763442,-122.429543&spn=0.003728,0.005944&t=h&z=18"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=San+Franci...</a> this block is bounded by the 300 and 400 on the west and east, and 3400 and 3700 on the north and south), which disturbs this boy's sensibilities being a nerd who grew up in Chicago, which is on a strict grid system), but I'm not going to suggest that it change either.",1259905129

He's got some acquisitions here I'm guessing you guys would consider more in the failed category.

For the same reason, people in business have their head elsewhere, either closing the year, dealing with the retail high season, or going on vacation.<p>The exception to this would be if your offering is b2b and has to do with a category that is very well allocated to an expenditure item in a budget for which there is generally speaking potential 'use it or lose it' money.<p>HTH",1259904432

What our models do is to give us an vague idea of what is happening.<p>There are barely any perfect geometric shapes in the nature, at least at the macro level.<p>Strictly speaking, math has to yield to the laws of nature as it does not exist outside the laws of nature (as mathematics is in our minds). But that is kind of sideways thinking, as of all the concepts and ideas that are achievable through mathematics we are mostly interested in those that fit to the world around us and we discard the others. That is the reason why so many people get this ""Oh my god it is all connected!"" feeling.<p>It is precisely so, because we are mostly interested in the aspects that fit the world we see around us and we selectively discard the aspects that do not fit. In a sense we are writing a story we want to hear.",1356263973

4959279,comment,4959066,4959066,11,0,RyanZAG,,,"Feels a bit like this whole issue is conflicting the management team with the investors - which is obviously very common in the startup world.<p>Need to take a step back and look at the primary purpose of acquiring investors: taking capital from them now in exchange for future cash flows to them later. To maximize this in favour of our business, we need to take the most money for the minimum amount of equity sold.<p>Now look at the primary purpose of the management team: to use the assets and resources placed in their care to create the highest future cash flows possible. This includes the tasks that Chris is conflating with investors: secure deals, find the best lawyers and accounts, getting meetings with difficult people. The management team is then compensated directly for their efforts.<p>The above is how it works in traditional companies. The investors invest capital and decide on the management team. The management team actually runs all facets of the business. In the startup world this relationship is not as simple, as the founders are both the primary shareholders and the management team itself.<p>What Chris is proposing is not as outlandish as it sounds - he is proposing joining the investors as part of the management team by selling shares to them for cheaper. If a share is worth $10 on the open market, but we sell it at $5 in exchange for valuable help from investors, then we are doing something very simple: we are paying these investors to be part of the management team, and in this case we are paying them $5 per share. This is a good option to take if the skills they bring are worth the $5, and a very bad option if we could hire better/more skills by taking the $10/share and then directly hiring on the market.<p>TLDR: Nothing to see here - you can pay people in equity or in cash, and the choice is as difficult as it ever was.",1356263741

That doesn't mean that the old slaves are not equal -- you then have Jim Crow laws, segregation, 70% of prisoners being non-white and other methods of control.<p>Plus have you talked with native americans, say, in the South Dacota?

Bad people have existed long enough that it's safe to assume the trend will continue.</i><p>Bad governments has existed even longer.<p>Especially some of them like, you know, the one at constant warfare with other countries, the nuclear-bomb dropping on civilians one, the McCarthyism and J.E Hoover one, the still having the death penalty in 2012 one, the bible yielding one, the BS marijuana prosecutions one, the Rodney King one, the Kent State shootings one, the world leader in incarcerations one, the BS WMD pretext one, the Watergate one, et al.<p>><i>Listening to their communications is the best way to stop them, or at least to ensure that they can't act openly.</i><p>The second phrase contradicts the first. They quickly assume they cannot talk openly and they don't, so listening to public, unencrypted communications has no use at all. You might catch some naive idiots that way but never the well organised big fish.<p>Plus, it's all a pretext.

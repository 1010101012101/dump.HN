666107,story,,,1,0,burke,"Advice for setting up a small corporation?",,"A couple friends and I have a (Canadian) partnership. Two of us are working on a new application that we wouldn't mind having a bit of legal shielding for, so we're planning on incorporating in the near future. However, since most of the stuff we do doesn't involve all three people, paying out 33% dividends to everyone doesn't make a lot of sense. We think we'd like to assign wages based on the projects we work on and the revenue they generate.<p>Does anyone have any advice to offer here? How should we set everything up? We're in Canada, but I get the impression that the legal framework is pretty similar to the US. How would you do it where you are?<p>Help much appreciated, thanks :)",1245469480

666103,comment,665284,665284,0,0,mr_bill,,,"Sock puppet account here to protect privacy...<p>I often wonder how relevant someone's upbringing is in stories like this.  I've been depressed and ""heard"" suicidal and self-hateful thoughts pretty much every day since I was 9 or 10.  But I was raised in a small town in the Midwest by parents who would tell me (with the best of intentions) to ""suck it up"" and ""get over it"" when I was in a particularly deep or prolonged funk.  I pretty much cried every day in 4th grade anytime I was alone due to being overwhelmed by how much I hated myself.  Anytime something would happen, I'd think ""you should kill yourself.""<p>It never occurred to me that I might have a condition or that I was hearing voices. And perhaps I'm not, in the same way that this person is.  I have no idea.   All I knew was that I felt sad all the time, and others didn't seem to feel the same way.  My only conclusion was that I had some weakness or flaw that other kids didn't have.<p>I subconsciously found coping mechanisms.  First it was superhero comics and video games.  Playing sports seemed to help a good bit, too, though I despised the monotony of it.  Eventually, I found online porn, and that became my treatment of choice anytime I felt a funk coming on.  This caused a good bit of guilt, though and has made dating difficult.<p>I went out east for college and was suddenly in a community where people like me were ""diagnosed"" and put on medication.  I was surrounded by east-coasters on meds.  There was a clinical solution for ""being bummed out all the time."" I'd never considered that I might have a mental illness that could be treated pharmacologically.<p>I thought about seeing a professional about my situation, but the downsides seemed and still seem pretty immense.  Once you're officially diagnosed, your life changes forever.  If I was diagnosed as clinically depressed or something more serious like the conditions the original author claims to have, wouldn't I be labeled a crazy person for life?  And what if they recommended extensive, unpleasant treatments that would interrupt or seriously hamper my career or personal life?  If I test positive for some serious mental illness, would the doctor be obligated to inform the state?  My employer?  My family?<p>And once you test positive, doesn't that become your identity?  You are a crazy person, and your life revolves around that.<p>So when I read stories like this, my heart goes out to the person, but I also wonder how much of their situation was caused by environmental factors, specifically coming from a culture of clinical diagnosis and pharmacology.  Had I been raised by different people in a different environment, I'd be taking lots of drugs and probably would have a few hospital stays under my belt.  I would probably see myself as a crazy person and have a hard time getting work and supporting myself.<p>Instead, I'm an extremely high-functioning porn and work addict who suspects he has serious mental infirmities.  I could deal with them, but it would require the full focus of my time and energies for years to do, and who knows how it'd turn out?<p>Not sure that's better.",1245469287

This is also why IE is broken. Microsoft doesn't want IE to render the same as its contemporaries because then you don't need to test on IE anymore, which means you don't need Windows anymore.<p>""Microsoft controls things this way and it's been part of their corporate philosophy for a long time -- Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. They make something mostly compatible with the standard or competing product and then add proprietary extensions or quirks, and their marketshare alone forces people to take notice, and the hope is that eventually people will forget about the non-IE stuff and not bother to test on it anymore, meaning that now things don't work unless you have IE, meaning that you can't use the internet without Windows. That doesn't happen as often with the internet anymore, but as most of us know, it was quite successful for a pretty long time, and it's still successful for many non-web technologies (see DirectX v. OpenGL, etc.).<p>""And while things are no longer panning out to complete MS dominance, IE still plays a major role in defining what techs get on the web and what doesn't. For instance, crappy HTML 5 support because HTML 5 harms Silverlight. This is all intentional, don't fool yourself.""<p>Not sure what you mean by ""Microsoftie"", but it'd be interesting to hear an MS advocate's or employee's position on this.",1245467352

Color is a perceptual quality, not a physical one, so the ability to distinguish colors is intimately tied to their definition.<p>Since most people have fairly similar cone spectral responses, basing the model on an Asian woman instead of a French man wouldn’t really change it much. If using CIE colorimetry didn’t work pretty well, we wouldn’t still be using it all these decades later.",1245467215

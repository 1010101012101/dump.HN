That&#x27;s exactly what hackers said about LISP. That people can often emulate a language or even paradigm (eg OOP) within the original language using macro&#x27;s shows it. Strange enough, LISP can modify itself to do whatever modern languages are doing with similar productivity. It doesn&#x27;t work vice versa. On top of it, the LISP compilers make pretty fast code for such a flexible language and past engineers even made dedicated hardware for it.<p>That&#x27;s why, although far from perfect, LISP is still the ultimate, hackers&#x27; language.",1438826375

One of the problems in industry is that there are a huge number of cowboy coders who dismiss all of the important things they learned (or not!) at school.  The number of times I&#x27;ve run across people who said things like, &quot;Statistics is a complete waste of time&quot;, and then &quot;benchmarked&quot; their app by running it once...<p>So, basically, what I&#x27;m saying is that on the one hand working in industry will give you important skills that are hard to learn anywhere else.  You need to learn to read and write code, and you have to learn idiomatic ways of programming, and you have to do a <i>lot</i> of it.  You need to learn how to work with others and how to effectively prioritise work.  You can&#x27;t learn this at school.  On the other hand, you will be in an environment which may stunt your growth because it is often dominated by people who think that being able to write code is the only valuable thing a programmer needs.<p>School is an academic environment with (hopefully!) a focus on academic goals.  You will need these things to claw your way beyond the mediocrity that pervades our industry.  It&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t learn it anywhere else, but it is often hard to understand what is important and what isn&#x27;t unless you can surround yourself with people who have an academic focus.<p>I would gouge my eyes out before I would go back to school again, but I am very grateful that I <i>did</i> go.  I encourage you to either go to school or devote yourself to finding alternative means of learning all of the academic things you will need.  Doing it by yourself is much more difficult, but by no means impossible.",1438825213

I don&#x27;t recall exactly what it was, might have been how floating numbers were parsed/handled, possibly an edge case with Norwegian/English localization or something.<p>Net result, we had a pretty though debugging job on our hands, for a very small program...<p>(I feel a bit bad for singling out MS for this -- as I understand it, they are <i>generally</i> very good about maintaining backwards compatibility -- even to the extent that <i>that</i> becomes a problem.

It targets Neko, C++, C#, Java and Javascript. Imagine using Haxe to write reference implementations for file formats (or anything, really), then spitting out implementations for any other target language, so you could include it in a project using any runtime of your choosing.<p>The problems I see are:<p>* The language itself is not a high-level wrapper for each platform/target, so you still need to write different code for each platform. (OpenFL/Lime does a great job at handling this for you for games)<p>* The compiled output might have surprising runtime characteristics. For example, I tried writing an audio rendering app where I targeted C++, and had a naive two-dimensional array (a Vector of Vectors of Floats). When I tried retrieving an inner array, it would attempt to cast the array and its entire contents. This happened <i>every time</i> the array was accessed, and it was accessed multiple times per second. When I flattened the arrays to a single array and used a calculated index, it reduced the processing time from ~30mins to ~5mins.<p>* You can&#x27;t necessarily make use of each target language&#x27;s strengths. For example, I think the Java target does not support annotations.<p>* If you want to make use of platform libs/tech, you&#x27;ll need to define externs for each lib. (There&#x27;s some efforts to use a TypeScript->Haxe converter to convert all of the DefinitelyTyped definitions to externs, so the JS target is looking promising.)<p>* It seems like a lot of developers come from a Flash/ActionScript background, so there&#x27;s lots of ports of AS libs with documentation that just says &quot;See the AS lib documentation&quot;. This is not helpful for general developers.<p>* Due to having so many use-cases, it&#x27;s very hard to share knowledge for &quot;Haxe&quot; - are you looking for info on Haxe for games on desktop, or Haxe for games on HTML5, or Haxe for webapps on PHP, or Haxe for webapps on NodeJS...? This is a tribute to its versatility, but it means the developer mindshare gets splintered into separate tribes.<p>* Due to targeting other languages, you kind of have to be an expert in that language/platform already, which means you need to translate from the target language to Haxe in your head.<p>* Since macros can extend the language to do anything else, libraries will splinter based on capabilities and implementations of those capabilities. Some libraries might use an &quot;Optional&quot; macro, some might use &quot;Maybe&quot;, and they&#x27;ll do roughly the same thing but be incompatible.<p>* I believe libraries written in Haxe can only be distributed as source code, limiting commercial investment in developing libs. (Although, JS also has this problem but doesn&#x27;t seem to suffered.)<p>* Still has nulls. :(  It does make some efforts to make developers treat nullable values differently, but it seems inconsistent (and probably dependent on target).",1438823905

If you&#x27;re doing something visual, then a visual warning (<i>on whatever you&#x27;re looking at</i>) can be effective, while an aural warning won&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re listening to something then interrupting it with an audio warning will work great. Hand flying is a tactile experience, so that&#x27;s the sense you want to work with.",1438823431

It&#x27;s a recognition that child rearing is an important societal activity, and that in a modern, privileged, civilized society we should not have workplace policies in place that are hostile toward parents. Ageing populations are a real and present threat to many first world countries. In most western countries this is recognized at the governmental level with leave schemes, childcare subsidies etc.<p>This is also in response to changes in work patterns. In the 50s it was very uncommon for both mother and father to be working. Now the opposite is the case.

Of course, such commentary conveniently excludes the way poverty and unemployment is structural to the US economy and that there are systematic forms of racism embedded in the US legal code. These empirical realities force communities of color to take part in extra-legal activities and the violence that comes along with those activities.

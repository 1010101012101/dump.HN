I don't care if my code works when provided with a bunch of mocks and stubs I care weather or not my code works with the rest of the system.<p>The only way to call it unit testing is if you make unit mean something completely different to what most people mean by unit.

1853469,comment,1853053,1853053,0,0,sbaqai,,,"Warren Buffett - Sun Valley 1999 (excerpt from Snowball):<p><i>""I would like to talk today about the stock market,"" he said. ""I will be talking about pricing stocks, but I will not be talking about predicting their course of action next month or next year. Valuing is not the same as predicting.<p>In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it's a weighing machine.<p>Weight counts eventually. But votes count in the short term. And it's a very undemocratic way of voting. Unfortunately, they have no literacy tests in terms of voting qualifications, as you've all learned.""<p>""This is half of a page which comes from a list seventy pages long of all the auto companies in the United States."" He waved the complete list in the air. ""There were two thousand auto companies: the most important invention, probably, of the first half of the twentieth century. It had an enormous impact on people's lives. If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos, you would have said, 'This is the place I must be.' But of the two thousand companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. [21] And, at one time or another, all three were selling for less than book value, which is the amount of money that had been put into the companies and left there. So autos had an enormous impact on America, but in the opposite direction on investors.""<p>""Now the other great invention of the first half of the century was the airplane. In this period from 1919 to 1939, there were about two hundred companies. Imagine if you could have seen the future of the airline industry back there at Kitty Hawk. You would have seen a world undreamed of. But assume you had the insight, and you saw all of these people wishing to fly and to visit their relatives or run away from their relatives or whatever you do in an airplane, and you decided this was the place to be.<p>""As of a couple of years ago, there had been zero money made from the aggregate of all stock investments in the airline industry in history.<p>""It's wonderful to promote new industries, because they are very promotable. It's very hard to promote investment in a mundane product. It's much easier to promote an esoteric product, even particularly one with losses, because there's no quantitative guideline. But people will keep coming back to invest, you know. It reminds me a little of that story of the oil prospector who died and went to heaven. And St. Peter said, 'Well, I checked you out, and you meet all of the qualifications. But there's one problem.' He said, 'We have some tough zoning laws up here, and we keep all of the oil prospectors over in that pen. And as you can see, it is absolutely chock-full. There is no room for you.'<p>""And the prospector said, 'Do you mind if I just say four words?'<p>""St. Peter said, 'No harm in that.'<p>""So the prospector cupped his hands and yells out, 'Oil discovered in hell!'<p>""And of course, the lock comes off the cage and all of the oil prospectors start heading right straight down.<p>""St. Peter said, 'That's a pretty slick trick. So,' he says, 'go on in, make yourself at home. All the room in the world.'<p>""The prospector paused for a minute, then said, 'No, I think I'll go along with the rest of the boys. There might be some truth to that rumor after all.' </i>",1288540480

I further said that Apple is a software company, not a hardware company. They do software well.<p>Their hardware superiority is 90% myth, 10% reality.

The issue is if the CTR's aren't high enough or the ROI on the media isn't coming through to the advertising businesses, they will pull out and go elsewhere.<p>This is great because all it costs to sell the media is the sales guy salary, any commission he makes off the media sale, and if you're good any in-house media guys that create the banners/ads etc. The more traffic you bring, the more ""inventory"" you can sell.<p>Selling advertising and media is very profitable. Most internet companies make their money through advertising if their product is free. Only companies that sell actual things like EBay or Amazon make legitimate sales of real goods.<p>The trick is to keep the faith in your advertising platform. Yahoo, Google, Facebook ... companies advertise with them because they know eyes go there. What the product is determines the audience it brings, which will determine who your advertising clients are.<p>The more qualified the audience is, the more impactful the advertising is, especially if they know enough about you to target the correct ad (most advertising-revenue based companies will collect some form of data about their users for this - this is nothing new).<p>The loophole in the OP's logic is that people invest in the internet due to revenue growth of Yahoo. If Yahoo was the reason the investment was made, and all that money went back into Yahoo - yes there could be a false feedback loop. But as long as the advertising that is sold on Yahoo is somehow benefitting the advertising company, there is a sustainable model.<p>Only if they sell a bunch of advertising that later turns out to be useless will you have a pot of hot water to climb out of.<p>Edit: Impaction is definitely not a word.",1288539760

The start up is effectively an image editing service which will allow users to host the edited images for use wherever. I anticipate about 1 MB storage per edited image including all overheads. I intend to take a freemium approach with a free service for up to X images edited/hosted and a charge beyond that. I will possibly consider in-image advertising on the free images as a source of revenue. The problem is, I have totally no sense of scale for anticipated take up, although doing a few quick calculations for a worst case scenario (no paid subscribers) shows a significant cost per user that can potentially skyrocket in terms of Bandwidth where one simply cannot anticipate demand. How do I deal with this? Do I start off in a private beta on a simple shared/virtual server and then consider dedicated/S3/others? Also, possibly dodgy, but what about considering free image hosting solutions out there for free users on the freemium approach - I realise this is a huge liability - but just thinking about it the porn industry is probably a pretty good paradigm.

I also have talent in graphic design and can create meaningful mockups to guide coding development.  People pay for those two functions in the industry.

Rinse and repeat.<p>This has all sorts of psychology built-in, like forcing you to stop after 25 minutes, often in mid-task. This makes you more anxious to get back and finish the job.

I think downvoting starts a revenge cycle, and the methods that are in place to prevent revenge only make the revenge less direct.<p>For instance, you can't downvote replies to your comment, but you can go into their user history and downvote their other comments.  This is worse, because their other comments quite literally have nothing to do with what would have been downvoted had that measure not been in place.<p>If someone views downvotes as punishment, then this engenders retaliation, and retaliation doesn't engender civil discussion.",1288537258

This is perfectly rational for a commercial site that seeks to maximise engagement and page views, but it seems to actively harm both comment quality and the community dynamic.<p>It seems that the prime concern we have for HN is maintaining a high S/N ratio; Why should the karma system not make that desire more explicit? I may be completely wrong here, but I think most of us would like to see a community where people think carefully before they post. If we want to discourage flaming and poor-quality comments, I think we need to think harder about behavioural prods to discourage them.<p>I propose removing the display of a users' total karma on their user page and replacing it with their average karma. I would like to see voting privileges made contingent on average karma and would be interested to hear possibilities for punishing users with a high proportion of low- or negative-karma comments.<p>It is of course dangerous to use heavy-handed technical changes because of the myriad possible unintended consequences, but we all know that internet communities almost inevitably fail. As a community, we should be considering our options now while things are generally OK, perhaps even designing a 'nuclear option' for the possibility that HN experiences some sort of Eternal September scenario.",1288537212

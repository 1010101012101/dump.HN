It would be possible, I guess, for a strong AI to pump out stronger and stronger AI, so that humans will be unlikely to solve any problem  before the stronger and stronger AI solve it.<p>Until that happens, it will always be possible to write a better space-optimizing compiler. Afterwards, it will still be possible, but the strong AI will beat you to the punch.",1293281292

2038880,comment,2038220,2038639,0,0,Untitled,,,"> 3. Solar panels break down less than hand-turned generators.<p>I live in an African country and solar panels have one huge disadvantage. Solar panels are often used now to power boreholes (usually fully submersible pumps which have become fairly cheap and easy to install, compared to so called ""mono-pumps"" of the old days) and pumps near rivers  that are far from grid electricity. It is also used to power electric ""energizers"" for electric fences.<p>The problem is that solar panels keep getting stolen. It is something that is fairly valuable that should be outside. I can just imagine the amount of theft that will go on when people have solar panels on the roofs of their homes/shacks.<p>Also, the article failed to mention the real problem with using candles and fire for lighting - frequent fires.",1293281125

2038869,comment,2038067,2038800,0,0,jarin,,,"In the US, we (as a collective) hold sacrosanct the rights of a person against illegal searches and self-incrimination, as well as the 'innocent until proven guilty' doctrine. The idea is that it's better to let a criminal go than to convict an innocent person.<p>Disallowing illegally obtained evidence also has the effect of discouraging the police from illegally obtaining evidence in the first place and reducing opportunities for corruption. Of course, in this case it didn't work out so well, but you would see a lot more stories like this if sources of evidence weren't important.",1293280003
2038868,comment,2038079,2038079,0,0,korussian,,,"I think for most people writing a search engine is overkill when there are existing options out there.<p>If you want to search a subset of sites, then Google CSE is really all you need + whatever bells & whistles you'd like to add around it.  I've done that here: <a href=""http://searchESLCafe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchESLCafe.com</a>, adding ""recent searches"", search via wildcard subdomain (i.e. foo.searchESLCafe.com or bar.searchESLCafe.com or foo_bar.searchESLCafe.com, etc), and customizing the heck out of Google CSE's options.<p>Is there a demand out there for the search engine to parse the results into something informative at-a-glance?  I'm not so sure it's the user's first priority.  Or, to put it another way, there's plenty of hard-to-reach info out there that you can hand users via a customized Google CSE, and they don't mind doing the leg-work of clicking on the query results and finding their own answers.<p>It's a lot more important to have an accurate search algorithm than drill-down-related bells & whistles.<p>Google does a great job of returning solid results for any subset of sites, so why not let Google handle it, and concentrate on the other stuff?",1293279982

I will admit that going through the UT system is not conducive to starting a startup -- you kind of have to break the mold.<p>The classes that are taught are great if you want to work for a large company because for the most part, the professors at the undergraduate level do a good job of teaching what's needed for those type of careers but do not actively promote entrepreneurship.<p>I was lucky in that my advisor encouraged me to go my own direction, and I started JobSpice less than a year after I graduated but wish I would have started something during my time at UT. The problem lies more in the culture that UT promotes at the classroom level.  In addition, outside of Michael Dell, you don't hear stories about past students creating companies in their dorm room like you do at MIT, Stanford or Harvard.",1293279230

Big money investors who operate cab companies do.  A company can buy a medallion and pay for it from their cab fleet in a day.  An individual driver can never hope to make that much money anymore.<p>Also, when all the new medallions were issued and the GPS/credit system put in their cars, some of the companies passed the cost of install onto the drivers, taking more than the maximum lease rate (The current day rate is like $229, whether you&#x27;re on the road or not).<p>Cab drivers aren&#x27;t making that much money ultimately.  It has always been bad but it&#x27;s way worse now than it used to be (my mom drove a yellow from 1978-1992 before she became an RN).<p>The overwhelming majority of the money earned in a taxi cab goes to the medallion holders -- owning a medallion is basically a guaranteed 5% ROI because the fare price is fixed.

We don&#x27;t even know how humans process discourse...<p>>> It seems more practical to do work on stuff that could actually benefit from machine learning, as opposed to trying to solve incredibly difficult (and mostly theoretical) problems like discourse analysis.<p>The thing I am not sure about is how much it makes sense to attempt to create discourse analyses vs doing more &quot;practical&quot; work. The reason is that a complete and accurate discourse analysis seems nearly impossible. Having read through a few reference grammars and phonological analysis of various languages myself, it seems any rules linguists create are always wrought with copious exceptions and special cases (though certainly not all! There are examples of phonological rules that are very very regular across languages). Some of these analyses were extremely intricate.<p>I got the impression that many of them suffered from the mistake of trying to prescribe patterns to data that does not have any patterns.",1376776516

A little searching turned up two interesting thoughts from Dijkstra on AI:<p><i>Finally, to correct the possible impression that the inability to face radical novelty is confined to the industrial world, let me offer you an explanation of the continuing popularity of artificial intelligence. You would expect people to feel threatened by the giant brains or machines that think. In fact, the frightening computer becomes less frightening if it is used only to simulate a familiar noncomputer. I am sure that this explanation will remain controversial for quite some time for artificial intelligence, as a mimicking of the human mind, prefers to view itself as being at the front line, whereas my explanation relegates it to the rearguard.

It sheds light on what&#x27;s wrong with the OP&#x27;s proposal: in return for less nesting, it worsens the conceptual gap between the program (in text) and the process (in time). A poor trade.<p>I&#x27;ve found that nesting to indicate asynchronous control flow can be quite a good device for keeping the program text closely related to its dynamic execution. (It&#x27;s true that such code is hard to read in JavaScript, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s because of nesting per se.) It allows you to lay out synchronous logic along one dimension (vertically) and asynchronous along another (horizontally). I hypothesize that there&#x27;s a quite good notation waiting to be brought out there; unfortunately, such experimentation tends to be done only by language designers in the domain of language design, when it really ought to be done in the context of working systemsand that&#x27;s too hard to be worth the trouble unless you&#x27;re programming in something like a Lisp.",1376776050

This used to be part of a user&#x27;s profile URL but Facebook allowed people to choose a &quot;vanity URL&quot; quite a while ago, so they&#x27;re no longer as visible. So, instead, the userId is obtained from a FB Graph API query.<p>2) The form that makes up the &quot;post to newsfeed&quot; has a bunch of hidden inputs.  One of them refers to a &quot;xhpc_targetid&quot; and this is probably where the target userId is injected.  It&#x27;s normally set to the current user&#x27;s id for a default newsfeed post. These values in the DOM are modified during the exploit using something like Chrome Developer Tools on-the-fly and the form is submitted.<p>If this is truly the case (and I haven&#x27;t verified it myself) this means that the server side is not really checking permissions and just blindly trusting the client input.

6230466,comment,6229004,6229004,4,0,abalone,,,"Fun article, but the title is a little misleading. It&#x27;s not that Starbucks doesn&#x27;t use 2-phase commit. It&#x27;s that they break their sales process into a couple of atomic transactions that run in parallel: payment and delivery. Each of those steps still in fact uses 2-phase commit.<p>Running a credit card or accepting cash is 2-phase commit. Drink pickup could be seen as a 2-phase commit (put drink on counter, confirm name, take back if name doesn&#x27;t match). What&#x27;s interesting is the exception handling logic between these parallel transactions. I.e. if payment fails while drink is getting made, try to cancel the drink delivery.<p>So the issue here is not &quot;atomic or nonatomic&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;how do I break a business process down into a set of atomic transactions&quot;. Very few businesses are going to run their entire supplier-to-customer process inside of a single atomic transaction.",1376775936

My dad worked for years in Akron rubber factories, often in front of a steam-powered press of some sort.  Temperature was controlled through large exhaust fans -- a practice largely adequate when the outdoor temperature was cool but barely tolerable in August.  I recall Summer days when he would instruct my mom before he left home that the window air conditioner in my parents&#x27; bedroom should be cranked up to full power in anticipation of his arrival home from work.  [We didn&#x27;t have central air at the time]  After eight hours in a 100+ degree Fahrenheit work environment, he wanted little more than to lie down in a cold room.<p>I was thinking just a couple of weeks ago about this and how a refrigerated suit would have made him much more comfortable (and likely a more efficient worker).  Even if an employer does not care about the happiness of its employees, it does care about productivity and the wage required to attract and retain workers.  Why are refrigerated suits not more common?  I recall reading about ice pack vests worn by people in sports team mascot suits.  However, I don&#x27;t see the guys working on the side of the road wearing anything similar.<p>Could an inexpensive, reliable suit be &quot;powered&quot; primarily by dry ice?  I presume the energy density of a block of dry ice to be at least a order of magnitude greater than a modern battery pack.  I&#x27;m imagining some sort of small water pump which would cool off the water by allowing it to flow around the dry ice and then circulate it around a person&#x27;s body.  It doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable for a road crew to carry along a cooler of dry ice for suit refills.",1376775248

That may be true from an emotional standpoint, but from a practical standpoint what he&#x27;s done has benefited all layers of the city. The gentrification of Manhattan has generated a ton of revenue which is being plowed into services across the city. Honestly other than being better at feeling people&#x27;s pain, I don&#x27;t really see the argument.</i><p>There are some problems though...Bloomberg started the policy of having a bed for every homeless person.  Just to keep them off the street and out of the public eye.  This is being paid for with taxpayer money and for more than $100/night.  A lot of residential buildings on the upper west side have kicked out their tenants to convert exclusively to housing the homeless at high daily rates because of the money.  This has contributed to a massive hike in rents across the city.  Landlords are definitely the &quot;rich&quot; we&#x27;re talking about here and Bloomberg has absolutely no problem with the practice.",1376773639

6230375,comment,6229753,6230308,8,0,jcnnghm,,,"I&#x27;d agree with that, with the qualification that $80-100k may actually be a bit low.  In the United States overall, the upper quintile of income starts at about $102k [1], so an income between $80 and $100k would place you in the upper-middle class.<p>However, it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that the cost of living in San Francisco or New York is much higher than average.  Median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $2,795 [2] in San Francisco, that alone is over $33k a year.  The SF cost of living index is 161.3 and the Manhattan cost of living index is 223.9.  In other words, $100k in Manhattan is equivalent to about $45k in an average place in the US, firmly in the middle quintile.  The Living Wage Project suggests it takes at least $100k to be effectively middle class in New York [3].<p>It&#x27;s really not a perception thing, it&#x27;s reality.<p>1: US Census 2011 Household Income Table HINC-05<p>2: <a href=""http://priceonomics.com/the-san-francisco-rent-explosion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://priceonomics.com/the-san-francisco-rent-explosion/</a><p>3: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/27/cities-high-cost-of-living_n_1236841.html#s644530&title=4_San_Francisco"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/27/cities-high-cost-of...</a>",1376773596

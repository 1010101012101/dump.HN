2081290,comment,2081158,2081220,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"I think it's ridiculous to assume that all physical books are worthless. There are reasons to prefer physical books, after all; they're easy to carry around, they don't run out of battery or need any maintenance like charging, and they're generally much cheaper than an e-Reader. If you're not a heavy reader, and not many are these days, why would you spend $150 on a book-reading device? You still have buy the books you would buy anyway, and you have much more freedom buying individual books. e-Books may take a cut out of printed books, but I sincerely doubt they'll obliterate them entirely.<p>On top of all that, used book stores provide much more value than big commercial vendors like B&N because their selection is so broad and so cheap. Used books are in general perfectly fine to be re-read, so people seeking bargains on new books go there frequently; e-Books will generally not be discounted very quickly, there is no such thing as a ""used e-Book"".<p>The _real_ reason used bookstores are going to be around for a long time, though, is that there are A LOT of books out there. Even if someone was able to digitize millions of books, there'd be millions and millions more that would only be able to be found in used bookstores, especially with older books. Just go into your local used book store and ask yourself how much of that catalog is available on the Kindle, or will be made available any time in the foreseeable future. It's a pretty small percentage.",1294437256
2081289,comment,2079473,2079782,0,0,sedachv,,,"StarLisp is basically Common Lisp with parallel-map and parallel-reduce and a special vector data type for them. You can do data-parallel operations over arrays trivially, but it's not clear what array chunk size tradeoff you need for a given problem on today's small core count machines. It might make sense to bring the approach back when there's 100-core machines around; that would basically be a CM-5 on a chip.<p>In the meantime there's a StarLisp simulator you can play around with: <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/starsim/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/starsim/</a><p>When it comes to data parallelism, StarLisp's successor Paralations (<a href=""http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.08/08.07/Paralation/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.08/08.07/Paralat...</a>) is much more interesting because it deals explicitly with locality. Paralations' successor, NESL (<a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/nesl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/nesl.html</a>) is implemented on top of Common Lisp, but it's a functional language with ugly syntax.<p>It would make a lot of sense to have something like StarLisp or APL for CUDA right now. Trying to do data parallelism in C is about the most brain-damaged idea ever. I don't know if anyone is working or interested in that, though.<p>Overall, I think the MultiLisp (futures) approach is a bigger win for general-purpose parallel programming than StarLisp data parallelism. Doing everything with data-parallel algorithms is hard - you're doing everything with array programming like in APL, but now you need to come up with clever ways to parallelize everything too. But the algorithms themselves are beautiful (read Hillis and Steele's Data Parallel Algorithms, my favorite algorithms paper: <a href=""http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:efZTS1nDfBsJ:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.85.1876%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf+hillis+steele+Data+parallel+algorithms&hl=en&gl=ca&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShW4j_bt4y5VRsTqM7e7IPnAHp1KxQGGH0aHERCb-YZiQBvx8_ERTfrgzb2TsIryUWfBGRUY-JNCEh-reU0BcUfcC8nusO-TyqzlzNelNaeIDsWdgtM7kFLZVuMgIN6_UrDfeOU&sig=AHIEtbRyegDoFIwWgJrFCgdgIb2VlOAseg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:efZTS1nDfBsJ:c...</a>)",1294437252

Then the Microsoft people who brought you COM in all its baroque loveliness got their hands on the concept and made an industrial strength, godforsaken, complex thing called SOAP. The problem with SOAP mostly stemmed from the fact that they thought that all the work would be done by compilers and IDEs and so forth... they thought all the programmer would do is click a button and hey presto they would be able to run one object on one server and another object on a second server, and who cares what happens on the wire protocol?

Over the past 3.5 years the Facebook platform has evolved so quickly that a lot of bugs simply disappeared by deprecation; if they had spent more time on solid architecture they would have left a lot on the table business-wise.<p>Also, I'm not sure if you used the Facebook API when it was new, but I remember in 2007 being distinctly blown away by how functional it was and how far ahead of the curve they were on web APIs.

Note that the ""secret in-crowd"" you mention is <i>more likely</i> to be the kind of people that you want to associate with anyways, people who will have a positive effect on your personal and professional life. Technical interviews are largely unfair, but we agree that they are necessary to weed out the worst candidates. Social etiquette is very similar in that it's somewhat unfair to the people who are bad at it, but at the same time it's a very effective screening process. I would never anticipate getting mugged by someone wearing a suit.<p>As for the bit about efficiency, I was mostly trying to point out that the etiquette rules are not baseless, and following them is not zero-sum. Each efficiency gain in itself is minimal. What is the value of an unbroken conversation over the course of a meal without a single interruption from the wait staff? What if it's 100 times per year? How about that waiter who can effectively add an additional table to his load because he doesn't have to pause and question before removing a plate? At a nice restaurant, each table is probably worth about $7-15 per hour to the waiter.<p>Giving out my address is not 90 seconds per year total, it's about a minute per friend for each time that friend wants to send me an invitation, or a thank you note, or a Christmas card. How special does it feel to receive a handwritten note? It helps maintain relationships and improve everyone's happiness, and it employs people in the business of selling stationery and teaching calligraphy. In reality, by not having their friends' addresses handy, people end up sending thoughtful notes less often, they are sent in a less-personal digital format, and the occasional mailing becomes a (minor) burden to someone for whom you are trying to do a favor.<p>Etiquette-based efficiency gains don't even have to be major to be worthwhile. Most rules of etiquette are practical and are designed to make life smoother and more enjoyable for everyone. With stress being a major factor in health, and with happier people being more productive, even minor gains in these areas can multiply quickly.<p>Now for a rant about nice clothes...<p>I never said that the clothes are about efficiency; they are more about looking good, feeling confident, being less wasteful, getting great service, and employing more people. I just bought my first nice suits and shoes last month, and the difference in comfort surprised me. Since the measurements are custom, the fit is perfect. The material looks and feels great. Call it fashion or personal taste all you want, but every friend I've encountered has commented on how good I look in my new suits. Between that and the added comfort, I feel more confident, and I find myself rebuilding my sense of self-worth from the low place it was in about eight months ago.<p>Another major difference is the buying experience. While shopping for my new things I had a suit salesperson working closely with me, advising me on the subtle aspects of different styles and making sure I selected something I would be happy with. After making my selections, a tailor measured me to ensure that the (yet-to-be-made) suits would be perfect for me. When I purchased my shoes, a shoe salesman measured my foot to find my exact size (an unusual 10eee), offered me advice for proper care, and gave me his contact information.<p>What happens after the purchase is even more critical. When I picked up my suit, the same salesperson inspected the fit and the quality to ensure that everything was perfect. When I lose weight this year, I can take my suit back to the same store for free alterations. When I had a minor issue with my shoes, I was able to email the shoe salesman and get an answer and a solution with minimal hassle.<p>And it doesn't even stop there. A good suit will be in my wardrobe for a couple decades. When the elbows wear or the seams tear, you take them to a tailor for repair. When the shirt cuffs fray, you get new cuffs. When the shoes lose their luster, you get them shined. When the soles wear, a cobbler puts new ones on.<p>To sum it up, I get an amazing service experience and excellent ongoing care. Along the way, I help several salespeople, a couple tailors, a cobbler, some fashion designers, various shoe shiners and dry cleaners, and countless others make a living. I am less wasteful because my clothes are not shipped across the Pacific, laundered inefficiently at home, and thrown into a dump after a couple years of usage and some wear. I provide people with meaningful, skilled, safe jobs instead of dangerous and unhealthy sweatshop work.<p>It's easy and popular to look at rich people and call them entitled douchebags, but when you get down to it, many of them are doing a lot more good in the world than you would think.",1294434143

667285,comment,667254,667254,0,0,Confusion,,,"Sounds like he is describing my university years. I think the problem is simple: the most important thing in your life is something that can consume an unlimited amount of time. There's always more to do, to learn, to explore, so you never feel you've done <i>enough</i>. I think that is also the key to solving the problem: you have to set precise, reasonable, goals and disengage yourself from that 'most important thing' when you've reached the goals you set for the day, week, month. Otherwise, the maelstrom will take all your time.",1245576837

And\n  now the one-time freest nation of the world has turned dictatorship\n  with a dangerous moron in charge, set to attack Iraq to revenge his\n  father's loss.  Those who laughed when I said that stupidity is the\n  worst threat to mankind laugh no more; they wait with bated breath\n  to see if the world's most powerful incoherent moron will launch the\n  world into a world war simply because he is too fucking stupid.  But\n  what really pisses me off is the spineless American people who fails\n  to stop this madness.  Presidents have been shot and killed before.</i><p>This is a fine example of the nastiness I guess, but it kinda makes sense in a weird sorta way !",1245575857

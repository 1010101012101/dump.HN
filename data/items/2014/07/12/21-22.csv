I was writing about the dangers of relying on timeouts in distributed systems a decade ago.  Your appeal to authority will get you nowhere.<p>The problems you describe in your last paragraph aren&#x27;t browser problems.  They&#x27;re distributed-system problems - synchronization, coordination, cache consistency.  They&#x27;re problems in systems that just happen to include a browser as a component, and they also happen in systems that just happen to include a kernel as a component.  You don&#x27;t get to count those problems as part of the browser domain and exclude them from the kernel domain.  That&#x27;s totally disingenuous.  As a distributed file system developer I deal with exactly these kinds of problems every day, in a context where browsers are irrelevant.<p>The fact remains that validating <i>either</i> a browser or a kernel as a TCB is extremely hard.  It&#x27;s not one easy and one hard, so we must choose the easy one.  Sure, people who know nothing about the constraints that guide kernel programming might dismiss &quot;fiddly bits&quot; that they don&#x27;t understand as needless complexity, or turn away from them entirely to comment on the remaining &quot;straightforward&quot; bits as though they were the whole.  Sophists might use &quot;I don&#x27;t even know&quot; as an excuse to dismiss a relevant point instead of engaging on it.  Every developer likes to think that their own domain is the most challenging and important one ever, so they can feel all elite.  So be it.  Still, none of that changes the fact that DJB&#x27;s argument was ridiculous.  The reason we can&#x27;t trust the browser as a TCB is because they were designed to requirements that are antithetical to that purpose, not because they&#x27;re actually or inherently too complex.",1405201868

8025871,comment,8025184,8025741,7,0,tedsanders,,,"It&#x27;s hard to rule anything out, but I think using non-atomic matter would be very difficult for a few reasons.<p>(1) Subatomic particles are not necessarily smaller than atoms. Even though in the particle sense, an electron is infinitely small, in the wave sense, an electron can extend over a volume much larger than a single atom. So it&#x27;s not necessarily the case that a subatomic particle like an electron is smaller than an atom. (Also, the positive charge of the nucleus actually helps shrink the electron&#x27;s range. So adding positive particles can end up making the system smaller.)<p>(2) If you want a transistor every 1.5 nm, then you probably need at least one particle every 1.5 nm. And the only way you can pack matter that densely is if it&#x27;s charge neutral (a clump of singly charged particles would immediately disperse from electric repulsion). So you either need a combination of positive and negative particles (atoms), or neutral particles like photons/neutrons/neutrinos. The problem with neutral particles is that there&#x27;s no long-range forces to keep them in whatever structure you design. Gravity is too weak at that scale, and electromagnetism has no effect because they are neutral. Perhaps photons could be used for computation, but without using atoms for mirrors/lenses/waveguides/etc it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine how.<p>TL;DR: Atoms are an efficient way to pack particles and preserve structure. It&#x27;s hard to imagine doing it with a plasma or gas or something else.",1405201528

Just like receiving grades to measure your understanding when you were in school, these metrics allow you to assess whether you are moving in the right direction, and if so, to feel a sense of accomplishment.

Not in the case of Levittown.<p>Just after WWII, suburbanization was driven by the fact that a) there had been a terrible, deep and long recession just prior to the war 2) during the war, with two income families unable to have kids because hubby was off at war overseas and wifey was working in a factory at home, savings rates approaches 50% for some parts of the war (in part due to rationing -- people were encouraged to grow vegetable gardens so that what farmers grew could go to feed our soldiers overseas) 3) women who had been recruited to work in factories during the war were encouraged to go home and have babies and be full time wives so the returning soldiers could get jobs (and many women were very happy to do that) 4) a very high percentage of men had served in the military and now qualified for federal help with getting a house, as well as federal help with going to college.<p>This is the roots of the sudden large middle class you saw in the 1950&#x27;s. And that is the root of the high demand for housing, which America worked hard to meet in record time. We are still living with the legacy of that decades later when our demographic has changed and it no longer serves us that well.<p>I have no doubt that this benefited whites more than blacks. But it was not rooted in whites trying to get away from blacks/cities/whatever per se.<p>Edit: My point about Victory Gardens was about the impact on personal finances. They also rationed sugar, cigarettes and other things. The point is that there were a lot of two income families who were not having children and there were also no luxury items to buy during the war. So personal savings rates were crazy high.",1405200921

This is a very unattractive position for both businesses and employees since most other cities do not have this problem. Shopping in Detroit is not convenient at all.<p>Add to that the high unemployment rate, the police problems, the near infinite amount of house and building fires, the poor public transit system and the total lack of bike lines.

(we do have them all around us and in us for what its worth)<p>I think a part of the answer is that if you have free form replication that isn&#x27;t perfect, then sooner or later something is going to emerge from that goo that realises that it&#x27;s just more efficient to eat the goo. Combine that self correcting cycle with hard limits imposed by nature (presumably they need to have a power source to make it work - the goo would start to die the minute it gets to a millimetre because of inaccessible sunlight. Then there is toxicity, what happens to the waste? Heat dissipation. Structural issues and other things...) and you have the recipe for a shorter sci-fi series than Firefly. (Dear Mark, today we succeeded in making self replicating nano-robots. They were exponentially multiplying within the petri dish and then they stayed in the petri dish, because apparently nano-robots are tastier than glass and metal. Doesn&#x27;t matter though, we cracked open the crate of champagne anyway.)<p>Which is also an argument against von Neumann probes, btw.

There are also a growing number of companies in the East Bay. &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; is not a city, it&#x27;s a sizable (and effectively growing) geographic region.<p>2. While startups are a prominent part of &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; lore, most startups fail and are incredibly vulnerable to economic cycles. Dozens of large companies are the glue that hold Silicon Valley together. There is a revolving door between these large, established companies and startups and it provides a talent pool to startups and safety net to tech workers that no other region can currently match. Attracting &quot;startups&quot; to your city is the easy part; attracting (or organically growing) the big companies is the hard part.<p>3. Not only is there more money for tech investment in Silicon Valley, there are more sources of it. One side of Sand Hill Road probably has more venture firms ready to write checks to technology startups than most cities have in total. That&#x27;s not going to change any time soon.<p>4. While the percentage of total employed persons in the Bay Area who work in tech is much higher than the national average, it&#x27;s still below 10%. The economy here is incredibly diverse and there are plenty of people earning good money in other industries like law, finance and medicine. In fact, a lot of folks working in these fields in the Bay Area make more than the average tech worker.

While this is exactly what I am looking for, I want to know what is the minimum amount of equipment needed to get any jobs. For example the most important are the cameras, but to mount them you would need a ladder. To be able to bring a ladder to sites you need a long van. Then you need experience as an electrician if the house in question does not have the Ethernet cables installed. All these expenses add up to 100k plus 100k for a storefront at a minimum, correct?",1405199162

I could change the aesthetics to the user&#x27;s preference.<p>This is the most design-ignorant post I&#x27;ve seen on HN in a long time, and I think this quote really highlights what&#x27;s wrong with it. No, not all pages have navigation that can be put in some One True Hierarchy metadata style. To take five high-volume sites as example: Facebook, Bank of America, Google Search, Google Docs, and Google Maps all have <i>fundamentally</i> different usage patterns that simply would not work if styled in remotely the same way.<p>Yes, if all pages were just essays with occasional links (as they were in the 90&#x27;s), then pages w/o site-provided CSS would be great and you could use user styles for all your customization (FYI, feel free to click View > Page Style > No Style in your menu bar to do this for yourself). Cool, but it&#x27;s 2014 now, and people expect their websites to be native-competitive applications that allow them to get things done quickly.<p>> Honestly, the hubris of designers can be amazing. As if aesthetics is a universal.<p>another choice quote. FYI, design has very little to do with aesthetics; Design is how something <i>works</i>. Aesthetics is just one tool that should help to make clear how something works.<p>> They&#x27;ll do your work for you.<p>No. No they won&#x27;t. They&#x27;ll leave your site for one that is easier to understand and use, where they can do as little work as possible to get done what they want to get done. If you disagree, go try to prove it in the marketplace. I think the market has made quite clear what level of design users prefer.",1405198963

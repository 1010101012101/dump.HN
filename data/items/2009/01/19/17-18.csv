They certainly do.<p>It's that their marketing advice (like Joel's) can be a little off-base.  Both created a HUGE cult following with great writing.  This cult was a perfect match with their products (webdev geeks for 37s and all dev geeks for Fog Creek).  It's a beautiful sales engine, but it isn't particularly repeatable unless you are charismatic, a great writer, and are dedicated to creating a community like this.<p>In absence of this particular bottled lightning, you have to build a sales/marketing engine with some combination of sales guys, adwords, print ads, SEO, viral, whatever...  AND (of course) a great product that keeps getting better.<p>(this is all assuming you sell stuff to businesses).",1232387982

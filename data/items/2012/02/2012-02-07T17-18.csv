Even with the US funding behind us, and an American co-founder, options are surprisingly slim as the usual work visa  H1-B  is not suited for companies that are just starting out or for founders who have major stakes in the company. It doesnt matter how many jobs you do or promise to create, the options are surprisingly limited.<p>One gloomy forecast, this.<p>Can anyone who's gone through the motions of starting a company in the US as a EU citizen share their experience?",1328637597

The Cube had overheating problems. The batteries of a few Powerbook lines where problematic and had to be recalled. G5 Mac Pro's had leaking liquid cooling and fan problems. Powerbooks had problems with their DVD writers. Early MacBook Pros also had problems with their fans. You can find tons of similar events from 1999 to 2012. Lots of older Apple machines had problems that needed a firmware update to fix, from graphic glitches to what have you.<p>They don't imply that ""overall product quality has been neglected as of late"". Just that, in every company and in every product line, there are to be some problems in some models, some machines or even whole runs. Nothing is perfect, and nothing was perfect before. I cannot even enumerate how many times I had problems with faulty Wintel PCs.<p>What happened is you just had some Mac computer that didn't have a problem before whereas your new one has a non-yet-updated by Apple firmware. A very little empirical evidence for any claim regarding overall QA. Gee, Apple in 2011 made what's perhaps the world's best laptop, the MBA 13"" (touted as so by many Mac and PC review sites and magazines).",1328637562

But what does better mean?  Faster, more creative, more X?  Knowing the details of better is how I can build a plan to improve.<p>I also liken the fascination with ranking to when I thought I was pretty fast running a 5 second 40yd dash.

Let's just say that those two facts are enough to put this case out of the regular patrol officers' yard into the hands of ""some-sort-of special ops"" unit. What would LAPD do if they have to deal with a suspect locked up in some place, with guns and bodyguards? They would sent SWAT and run a boat anchor through the wall, just like we saw in the movie we downl... saw in cinema.<p>Why is it so extraordinarily strange then that the New Zealand police sent their own special unit? Quote wikipedia: ""<i>...formerly known as the Anti-Terrorist Squad, is the full-time tactical and counter-terrorism group of the New Zealand Police.</i>"" A police unit was sent, not the military. And they probably just have that one unit, so that unit has to counter actual terrorism AND measly secure private property with armed douche bags on it.<p>So, they sent a team of specialists to take control of an unknown situation with an armed suspect - sounds very rational and calculated, exactly what any efficient police would do. You do not endanger regular patrol officers in potential close-quarters gun fights.<p>And to claim now that Kim would have invited them in and talked to them is completely besides the point. An arrest warrant was out on him, the police had to deal with it and it is not for Kim to ""negotiate"" or comment on how he would have dealt with being arrested. His potential hospitality is irrelevant. He was a suspect, he was knowingly armed with bodyguards and they had to seize him - they obviously decided this arrest was more than an average patrol officer should handle. End of story.<p>Everything else is nothing but speculations and propaganda and feeds right into the natural suspicion that a lot of US Americans seem to have of the police. As a European, I am glad they are there and do their job. Was it a bit ""too much""? Probably... but that unfortunately comes with the terrain.<p>And I am speaking as a former paramedic who has seen a similar situation and was glad we had the police special ops there to secure the apartment before we could do anything about the patients in there.",1328637305

Police departments everywhere are becoming more and more paramilitary.<p>In the United States, the Federal Government actually gives surplus military gear to local law enforcement. SWAT teams are prestigious to have and every municipality's police force wants one. Many universities even have SWAT teams now, using the Virginia Tech shootings as a rationale for why they are necessary.<p>The problem is that SWAT teams are so rarely needed. Spending all that money on training for something that is rarely used is hard to justify. All that cool gear can't go unused. Plus, police officers on these teams tend to want to play special forces soldier. We get mission creep. It starts with drug warrants. Officers, ""based on training, knowledge and experience,"" state that ""drug dealers tend to be armed."" And anyone involved with drugs is a dealer for the purposes of drug warrants. So, using the surprising and overwhelming force of a SWAT team is necessary for ""officer safety."" Eventually, SWAT teams graduate to serving nearly all warrants. Some SWAT trainers recommend this for practice.<p>If you follow the news on this issue, wrong-door SWAT raids are a daily occurrence. Innocent people are terrorized. Innocent people die because of poor trigger discipline or mistakes in the heat of the moment. Sometimes, police are confused for home invaders and they are killed in self-defence. And the shooter is then facing capital murder charges.<p>SWAT raids create volatile situations. Unfortunately, the alternatives aren't as glamorous.",1328636776

(see political parties, religion, etc...)<p>Being a PC guy myself, I would love to buy my parents Apple products. For years I hated Apple despite never having tried a single Apple product. I just HATED Apple, i didn't know why. Until one day I just ordered a mac off ebay and got it in my home. After trying it out I realized something shocking. I don't hate Apple at all, It's the fans that I can't stand.<p>Up until then I was avoiding Apple because I was afraid I'd fall in love with Apple products and turn into a cult member like others I had seen. The Fanboy's arguments were always subtly insulting, condescending, seperationist, and reeked of elitism. If I used a PC I wasn't ""up"" to their level in creativity or intelligence. (I grew up around a lot of Apple Fanboys, and Nintendo fanboys too)<p>Long story short I kept the mac for months and used it every day but it just wasn't my thing, for my specific usage it wasn't anything better or more stable than what I had with my PC, I resold it. But one day I think I'll buy my parents a mac. That way I can sleep at night knowing they won't accidentally download an email attachment and brick the thing. And its easier for them to manage. I'm well knowledged in my PC so those benefits don't do anything for me.",1328636212

Every CS 101 class goes through that Mammal.breathe(), Mammal::Animal.walk(), exercise, and every time, someone asks, ""Well, what do I do with a dolphin?""  Do you borrow swim() from Fish?  Or breathe() from Mammal?  Or reimplement them?  Or what?<p>I'm convinced they're actually identifying a deep problem with inheritance as a paradigm.<p>I won't say it's useless; sometimes you really do have an ironclad relationship.  But I think if you just want to communicate that your object fulfills a promise, an interface is better.  And if the code reuse is circumstantial rather than essential, you're better off reaching for multiple inheritance from partial classes -- traits, mixins, whatever your modern language calls them.",1328636204

Just because the object of an ugly and vicious attack happens to be female does not make sexism the conscious or subconscious motivation behind the attack. It's highly likely that the same lynch mob would have gone after a man who aroused their fanboy ire, and with the same level of zeal and fanaticism. Playing the gender card here does no favors to Violet's otherwise interesting and provocative analysis.<p>Second, I don't understand what Apple is meant to do about this. If one is to accuse Apple, even indirectly, of inspiring this behavior among its fanbase, then one bears at least <i>some</i> burden for suggesting how Apple might address the issue. As it stands, I don't understand a) how this behavior is unique to Apple's fanboys versus, say, everyone else's fanboys, and b) what Apple should -- or even can -- do about it.<p>Finally, I agree with you that this is more a sad phenomenon of internet fanboyism in general, and less a phenomenon of Apple fanboyism in specific. That Apple fanboyism happens to stand out from the pack is probably a matter of sample size. There are more Apple fanboys out there, among the general population, than there are other types of fanboys. But anyone who's ever browsed an online message board, Reddit topic, etc., about any fanboy-generating topic (video games, movies, comic books, you name it) will see the same sort of craziness that was seen here. That doesn't excuse the craziness by any means; it's obnoxious, ugly, and counterproductive everywhere that it exists.

Fraud will now be your #1 issue (if it isn't already). People will make fake Etsy accounts, add fake products, and then make ""purchases"" using stolen credit card numbers. They will have the $ deposited to an E*Trade bank account, a pre-paid debit card that accepts ACH, or use some rube's account they found on Craigslist. Most of the time, you won't catch it until the money is already deposited. Then the chargebacks start coming.<p>I don't have the luxury of having a $50M warchest of VC money. You will definitely have to spend money and engineering resources towards this soon.<p>2. Based on your FAQ, you're requiring sellers to mark an item as ""shipped"" before depositing their money. We actually had to turn this requirement off because it annoyed so many sellers. When a seller gets an order (in our case, photographs), getting it fulfilled becomes their focus. Making them go back to the web and mark it as fulfilled is something they will often forget. Getting their money deposited is something they won't forget.<p>IMO, I would try to make this more automatic. Use something like Twilio to send the seller a text 5 days after the order ...

Then factor in the money USA employees have to spend to ""keep up"" with the on-average higher working hours - ever wondered why there are so many convenient services for practically everything in the USA that we Euros can only dream of? And ultimately you have to factor in costs of living in the valley or surroundings which are way higher than over here and way higher than in most other places in the USA.<p>Ultimately, I think this level of proficiency might be hard to sell in an interview because employers care about what you can actually do and if they want a Java or C genius, then they probably don't care that much that you could ""write a library"" but have no working experience in the languages they are requesting. But if you can plausibly sell them on your broader view and understanding of all things IT, ideally backed by some sort of study and degree, that might work but I am sure it would also depend on the position you are applying for.<p>You want to make close to or more than 100k as a programmer/it-expert in Euroland? Shouldn't be too very hard, either find a fantastic niche and work it and/or combine that niche with consulting work... I think the unfortunate truth is that unless you are some sort of coding rock star and/or become technical lead or something like that, just being good at writing lines of code in an arbitrary language isn't such a highly paid job anymore. Make that some obscure language for a very specific system, ideally serious-business system, somehow directly business/profit-related and all of a sudden you have leverage. A lot of the old host neckbeards are retiring or, excuse me, dieing out and I have to yet see a bank or stock exchange that runs completely without those old ""legacy"" systems and has successfully migrated 100% away from them. So, time to polish your COBOL and what-not skills, get some working experience there...

Higher prices (for heavier people) means that they are less likely to buy plane tickets, which could potentially mean less profit. So, you have to counteract this by incentivizing less heaver people to fly, by lowering the price for them, or by lowering the base ticket price slightly.

That being the case, if your feature spans multiple commits, then indeed you have something there. If your feature does not, branching probably isn't needed.",1328634309

Sometimes it seems like programming (with the start-up space in particular) is a kind of pyramid scheme where you advance to create nicer tools for the people who are less advanced. Of course there are plenty of other ways that start-ups and programming are <i>not</i> like that, but it's a really interesting lens through which to view a lot of the news that is popular on HN.",1328634243

Once you get two or more programmers working on a project, they have to be able to write code that the other programmer can readily understand.  Programming languages advance this goal to varying degrees; assembly does it poorly, and so does obfuscated C or Perl.  CoffeeScript, on the other hand, seems to have borrowed language features that enhance this human-to-human communication ability: significant whitespace, easily comprehensible object models, etc.",1328634055

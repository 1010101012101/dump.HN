It is built on Rails.  Supposing I totally screwed the pooch and it was structurally incapable of doing more than 100k page views a day without a top-to-bottom rewrite.<p>Suppose I got to that $8,000 revenues a day and figured ""You know what?  This is too darn constraining.  I WANT MORE, BWAHAHAHA"".  I'd be able to hire whomever I pleased to do the rewrite (pay $5k a day for my own ops team, who cares, I can afford it).  And it would be vastly easier scaling my site than Myspace/Twitter can scale theirs, because I would not have to set world engineering records to do so.<p>The first response any engineer is going to make is ""Erm, you should probably think of putting multiple web servers in front of a beefy database rather than running both web server and database out of a machine with 256 MB of RAM.""  This is a pretty easy engineering problem compared with ""OK, innovate technologically to be able to handle data on a scale that 5 years ago would have required a major multi-national corporation or minor nation state to generate.""<p>Then I'd be back to the boring-as-dust business of, you know, providing features to convince my customers to continue paying me money.",1228210792

382842,comment,382642,382642,0,0,randomwalker,,,"""Foo over DNS"" was innovative and amusing a decade ago. While a clever hack, it has no advantages other than the fact that the latency drops from 200 ms to 20 ms or whatever. I don't know any applications consuming wikipedia blurbs for which that's an issue.<p>As for parsing Wikipedia and extracting summaries, that's already been done by Freebase. They also let you search, so you don't even need the exact article title. I'm a happy user of their wikipedia blurb feature and a lot of the other data that their API offers. Freebase can be useful for enhancing practically any web app; go check it out if you aren't familiar with it.",1228209575

The data will come from periodic grabs of log files in /var/ and maybe from an HTTP polling thread.<p>I have two questions:<p>1. Pure Python persistence - does anyone have any good experiences with ZODB or anything else pure Python? (this is for fun)<p>2. What information would you like to see on a web app dashboard / analytics report, that you don't get at the moment?<p>Am not promising that I will make anything, but if I do and it turns out OK I will release as an open source project.<p>Many thanks",1228208707

382828,comment,382661,382724,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The guys behind SciPy are doing this sort of thing (not R, specifically, but scientific computing...they were doing fluid dynamics and geological data analysis).  It's a pretty specialized market, but one where huge sums of money are spent.  They had revenues in the millions when I left, and they only had two big customers (and a few customers who were putting out feelers for other options besides their current providers).  Anyway, they weren't actually making any money at hosted scientific apps yet, but they were building their data center out and getting the contracts in place, so I expect it's a reasonable portion of their business today.<p>But, if you or your co-founder isn't a PhD in the field you choose to tackle, you'll probably have a hard time getting a foothold.",1228208613

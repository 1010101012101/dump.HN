6370734,comment,6370343,6370649,4,0,davidcuddeback,,,"The original context was for building interactive GUIs. I think you&#x27;re right that web frameworks&#x27; concept of MVC is different than the original context because of the request/response cycle of HTTP. However, understanding the original ideas of MVC has helped me a ton even when writing backend code for the web.<p>Trygve Reenskaug actually setup a web page to explain how MVC was originally conceived [1]. My main take-away was that models correspond with the user&#x27;s mental model while using the application: &quot;The essential purpose of MVC is to bridge the gap between the human user&#x27;s mental model and the digital model that exists in the computer. The ideal MVC solution supports the user illusion of seeing and manipulating the domain information directly.&quot; The most important (IMO) implication of this is that your models aren&#x27;t limited to data that exists in a database, which is a mistake that I see a lot of web developers make.<p><a href=""http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/themes/mvc/mvc-index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/themes/mvc/mvc-index.html</a>",1378940362

But I think we reached this point where almost any initiative that tries to even the numbers in our profession is worth exploring.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d rather have us working on eroding the stereotypes, the arbitrary lines of separation, and the behaviors that got us to this point - I&#x27;m just not sure anymore that is even an option. Maybe building another, exclusive and discriminatory counter-club <i>is</i> the right move. Extended into the future, if programs like this turn out successful it basically amounts to opening up a whole parallel career support network for women, potentially a complete replica of what we have as the &quot;good old boys club&quot; for men right now, including the harassment and the peer pressure to stomp on everyone who doesn&#x27;t belong.<p>Gender segregation is something a lot of people seem to be becoming fond of (again). There was a moment in history where briefly it looked like we might break out of these shackles, but it seems that moment has passed and is quickly being forgotten. I believe if this trend continues, it will be one of the biggest failures of Western civilization.<p>The depressing thing is I can see how initiatives like this might be needed right now as a lesser evil compared to the alternative (which is having no women in CS at all).",1378940289

I&#x27;ve been told that it is easier to accumulate a lot of money if you are soulless. That allows you to take advantage of things that cause emotional stress and financial harm to others who are unable or unwilling to prevent you from taking their money in a &quot;perfectly legal&quot;[1] way. So when select randomly from the population of people who are very wealthy, your chance of picking someone who has your interests second to theirs is better than 50/50.

They are also deeply involved with the database and everything in between so a pure implementation of MVC is out of their reach.

Over the years we&#x27;ve seen the progressions of fat controllers to skinny controllers and fat models. Now, we&#x27;re seeing the progression of using models only for responsibilities related to persisting the object. This leads to extracting additional domain logic into Presenters, Value, Service objects, etc.<p>Avdi Grimm has a great book about this called Objects on Rails[1] and Bryan Helmkamp from Code Climate has a good introductory blog post on it as well[2].<p>Rails implementation of MVC is perfectly fine. It&#x27;s when people lean on MVC for everything without applying &quot;classic&quot; Object-Oriented design.

The closest you can come to that from a dictionary definition is to combine all the definitions provided and consider them as a whole, not as disconnected pieces.<p>The difference between advantage and privilege is that a privilege is an advantage that is given by an outside force and ceases to exist without the influence of that external force. A person may be provided, given, or granted a privilege, it is not something they innately have. Similarly a privilege may be taken away at any time. An advantage on the other hand typically can not be taken unless it&#x27;s some item or information that is providing that advantage and not some inherent capability. This is where the concept of a handicap comes from, it&#x27;s a penalty applied to someone in order to balance a advantage they have. Contrast with a privilege which requires nothing to be added, merely the privilege to be removed. There is similarly no equivalent of handicap with regard to privilege as it makes no sense to add anything to attempt to balance a privilege when simply removing the privilege is far simpler.<p>As for objective basis of my opinion, that&#x27;s the easiest thing in the world, there&#x27;s several hundred years of English literature to back me up.<p>As for the abuse of the word privilege in this context, you could say being male provides someone with an advantage, or being female provides a disadvantage, but you can not say that someone has a male privilege, as that implies someones male-ness can be taken away.",1378938784

These employees are likely to be treated identically with American citizen employees and paid exactly the same in the same roles.

Make it as easy as possible for the latter group to stay in the country, through a quicker green card process or other methods; at the same time, have higher scrutiny for the separate category of visas that apply to foreign workers brought in directly from outside.<p>It sometimes amazes me that even on a relatively knowledgeable forum like HN, this distinction isn&#x27;t made often or at all.",1378938565

VC&#x27;s are a vital part of the startup eco-system. I am not against them or how they operate. They are smart enough to be politically right and make themselves desirable to entrepreneurs. All I am trying to say there is usually information/knowledge/expectation asymmetry (as pointed out in the article) when engineers are getting into financial transactions with VCs, and that they need to be cognizant and work on ways to mitigate this.

When our country (referring the US) was founded, the requirements were being white and owning land, or having enough wealth to be taxed. (Which is also outrageous.)

Really?<p>Of course the patriarchy has its negative effects on men, but that&#x27;s a result of patriarchy&#x27;s existence, which is exactly what feminism is trying to correct. The man is &quot;being forced to provide for a woman&quot; because men want to keep women &quot;in the kitchen to make sandwiches.&quot; It&#x27;s two sides of the same problem.<p>And before you try to argue that men don&#x27;t actually want to keep women in the kitchen... I&#x27;m using that to refer to a larger cultural psyche. How much time do men get off for paternity leave in the US? Generally none. That right there reinforces the &quot;woman as homemaker.&quot; The woman has to stay home, the man has to bring home the money, thanks to the patriarchy.<p>>But the discussion is framed as &quot;we have things bad, you men need to fix it&quot;, but the &quot;you men&quot; in question are less safe than women, and are also not treated equally.<p>It&#x27;s not about &quot;you men&quot; fixing it.

One of the basic purposes of a government is to establish and defend borders.<p>I think this is probably the kernel of our differing views. I do view them as artificial. My hope is that, in the future, an individual&#x27;s ability to relocate becomes more a function of their means and less a function of nation-state legality.

Its stability is definitely not there (too be fair, they&#x27;ve made this clear), so it&#x27;s crashed when I needed it most. But here are the finer points:<p>1) Their team is extremely responsive. In fact, the most responsive team that I&#x27;ve dealt with on Github. I&#x27;ve posted at least 4 Github issues during various times of the day and evening and I&#x27;ve gotten a response in less than 10 minutes. Most of the time, more than one member responded.<p>2) They are not over selling their product like MongoDB did. They are very clear about what their product does and doesn&#x27;t do.<p>3) Clustering is stupidly simple. You can have one setup within minutes and have your servers geographically located throughout the world.<p>4) The web UI makes administering the databases easy and fun.<p>After they get the kinks (stability & docs) fixed, this database will definitely have a bright future.",1378936826

5186043,comment,5185884,5185884,16,0,abraxasz,,,"I've had to learn R during my master (in statistics), and found the process very unpleasant.<p>There are different ways in which a language can be difficult to learn. Haskell has a steep learning curve because it has a lot of unusual concepts (for those who come from an imperative background) and requires a shift in the way we think about code. J is also difficult to learn because the syntax is crazy, and again, the language is very different from what we're used to.<p>I found R difficult to learn because it is seems inconsistent to me. Now one reason might be that I picked up bits of R here and there without taking the time to learn the syntax from a book (unlike what I did for other languages), but it took me quite some time to be able to make sense of the different structures (vector, list, matrix, dataframe), their differences, and in particular how functions operate differently on these structures. I also have a deep hatred for the system of attributes (why would anyone want to give attributes to a vector...), and find the indexing system (especially for lists) to be nonsensical. In fact, I think that lists themselves are terrible to work with.<p>The general impression that I've had learning R is the language is not coherent and systematic in its design in the way other languages are (I know python, c, common lisp, ...), and I find myself spending a lot of time in the interpreter simply trying out things because I'm not sure that it will return what I want, in the format that I want (which never happens to me in any other language).<p>Now don't get me wrong, I use R daily and it's a useful tool. It has lots of great libraries, including the fantastic ggplot2, and the remarkable Rcpp (best C++ interface I've ever seen.. ok I haven't seen any other, but this one is really great). But learning it was no fun, and if the statistics community decided to move to a cleaner language, I'd definitely be running ahead..",1360292291

This is a bit suspicious that I was downvoted, then.<p>The front page says, ""Watch TV Shows in your Browser,"" and ""Easily know when your shows are on next."" Other headline-sized text on the front page basically reiterates those two points. That functionality is basically already served by the setup I describe.

I also get the ""Know when the next show is"" in just a few clicks.<p>If anything, my story points out a packaging issue, which may well be an opportunity. Only a programmer like me is going to stitch together the functionality of four apps to get the same effect. Let someone download a single tablet app, maybe download a ""server"" on their PC, and it all just works. There's issues doing this on the iPad, because of what Apple might or might not allow, especially with regards to torrents.<p>As it is, it looks like someone wanting to promote the site downvoted me to suppress competition.

The standard functions are sufficient but ggplot2 has a more finished appearance.<p>3)  Review available libraries.  If you want to do something, someone else likely already has and has posted a package to CRAN.<p>4)  One way for SQL developers to limit the need of learning the idiosyncrasies of the language is to use the sqldf package to manipulate data frames and use ggplot2 (which generally takes data frames as arguments) to display charts.",1360292014

5186012,comment,5185563,5185563,9,0,femto,,,"""Cognitive"" or ""White-space"" radio, the subject of the actual FCC notice, is real though.  In simplistic terms, it means making fixed ""FCC style"" spectrum management largely obsolete, by pairing each radio transmitter with a receiver.  The receiver is used to monitor the surrounding radio environment, and the system makes a determination, in real-time, of what (if anything) it can transmit whilst avoiding interference with other users of the spectrum.<p>Cognitive radio offers the potential for large increases in data capacity since the radio spectrum is currently underutilised.  I was at a conference a few years ago, where a presenter had done the measurements, and the utilisation of the radio spectrum (averaged across time and frequency) was about 5%.  It turns out that most licensees hardly, if ever, transmit.<p>There's currently a regulatory push to allow others to use a chunk of spectrum, as long as they don't interfere with the licensee, meaning the licensee gets guaranteed access, rather than exclusive access.  It should be interesting, since it will open the (cheaper?) alternative of buying smarter radios instead of buying spectrum.",1360291616

The problem was that those technical goals turned out to be not very helpful in terms of meeting Android's strategic goals, given the way the mobile OS/device market has evolved.<p>That's a mistake at a level above engineers and software architects (or at least a mistake so far - if, hypothetically, Intel managed to crack their mobile CPU problem the choice of Java would turn out to be very smart).

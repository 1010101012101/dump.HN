The only way to check if a PRNG is of cryptographically use is to analyze the way and sources used to generate the output.",1211356477
195817,comment,195160,195329,0,0,antirez,,,"No it depends on the language implementation, and in the PHP documentation you can read that at every execution the seed is automatically changed. So while in C you may need srand(time(NULL)) in order to get a different set of pseudo random numbers for every program execution in PHP you need srand(CONSTANT) in order to get always the same set.<p>Conclusion: PHP is buggy on windows if it does not change the seed at every execution like it is stated in the specification (documentation actually that == specification for PHP).",1211356263

He's brought a lot of original thought to _how_ to do software development for large development teams. His ideas scale down. I've used a lot of his ideas for groups in the 10-20 ppl range. His thoughts on using kanban systems have really worked well.<p>He is a controversial person in the Agile community.",1211356128
195814,comment,195247,195343,0,0,neilc,,,"<p><pre><code>  If I tip in a restaurant, it's because I want to be remembered.\n</code></pre>\nSo you never tip at a restaurant to which you're not going to return? (Suppose you're dining at a restaurant while traveling.) Besides, the chance that you're going to be ""remembered"" for leaving 15% (or 20%) at a typical restaurant is minuscule. The same goes for leaving $1 in the tipjar at a coffee shop.<p>I think you completely misunderstand the purpose of tipping. People tip because: (1) it is a social convention; they feel they are expected to, and the wages of people in service industries are structured to assume tipping occurs (2) they want to show appreciation for having a service performed. The first is not (yet) a factor for online tipjars, but the latter is still applicable.",1211356066

195810,comment,195763,195763,0,0,aston,,,"This is the wrong answer in so many ways. Starting with, if you're in a dynamic language and you're so performance sensitive that you can't take the hit of a loop comparison, you're doing it wrong.<p>But...Pretending you actually need to unroll your loops, you might ask, why did Duff choose ""8"" as the magic number? Was it, perhaps, looking at the code his compiler kicked out for the loop and choosing the number that optimized for byte copying on his architecture, given some constraint about common buffer sizes? Yes. Lacking an ""architecture"" target for Javascript, it probably doesn't make much sense to use Duff's constant just because he did.<p>And...if your function body is relatively slow, you probably don't need to unroll anything in the first place. Duff had a beautiful one-liner in there that in some situations is basically one clock cycle's worth of work. Javascript has no such construct that couldn't be batched in the first place (8 ++'s => one += 8). And if you make a function call, you've made your inner loop slow.<p>Moral of the story: Don't do this.",1211355349

I've looked at a bunch of them and there didn't seem to be a clear choice that provides all the sources that you provide here. I had a similar but very different concept some time back and am still looking for ways to get the aggregation easily without infringing on copyrights, etc. Your response would be much appreciated.",1211354999

That's why I said it was my <i>experience</i>.<p>I think the point is, I code in Ruby <i>and</i> in Perl, and my opinion is that <i>neither</i> language is particularly readable or maintainable.  Meanwhile, I have less experience with Python than either Perl or Ruby, yet I find it to be a consistently readable language.<p>Those are all opinions, but they're <i>informed</i> opinions (and I'm not simply advocating for the language with which I am most familiar).",1211354712

Adding to your list: Conference rooms and smaller break-out rooms are an important (and often overlooked) feature, communal fax & coffee machines are good additions, and the biggest place I see co-working spaces fail is in underestimating the bandwidth they need: a few people pushing around big files can saturate a line pretty quick.",1211354492
195804,comment,195765,195765,0,0,xirium,,,"This will be awkward to implement but not for the obvious reason of avoiding automated fraud.<p>In some jurisdictions, it is illegal to offer kickbacks for certain products and services, if not all. For example, in the UK, I believe that it is illegal to offer consumers cash to accept a line of credit. I believe it is for this reason that UK credit card affiliate programmes specifically prohibit affiliates from sharing revenue with consumers.<p>If you offer a cashback programme to end users, you'll have to forego some lucrative advertising and/or explain to end users that some offers in some jurisdictions don't provide any cashback and/or explain fraudulent clawbacks to a large number of end users. In addition, the exceptions will be awkward to implement, maintain and administrate.",1211354295

Seriously, how many companies have they gone head to head with in the past 30 years or so... Apple, Lotus, Oracle, Netscape, Nintendo/Sony, Tivo, Google...<p>Regardless of your opinions about Microsoft, you have to admit that this is one hell of a resilient company. Even if they fail in some markets they just keep going and going.<p>I don't know if this new advertising model will work or not, but I think in 20 years when the NBT comes out from some new startup, MS will be there to fight against it in the marketplace.",1211354270

Every feature and functionality that I want to put in there is already a plugin for it. If not, I can write one quite easily. The documentation could be better but there are plenty of books out there. I am not saying Rails is the ideal web framework but it comes darn close. If you want to get to market soon. I would say RoR is the way to go. Finally, if you are a stickler about writing test cases as us then the good news is that RoR comes with rich testing support.<p>As for hosting, Heroku is a good start.",1211353961

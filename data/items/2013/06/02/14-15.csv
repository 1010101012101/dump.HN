I would recommend:<p>* Go to (and speak at) meetups involving technologies you work with. It's a great way to showcase your skills.<p>* Be charitable with your time. Be willing to meet people for coffee and provide free advice. These sort of meetings often directly or indirectly turn into work.<p>* Leave your company in good terms--they might use you as a contractor after you leave.<p>I would definitely recommend saving up 4-6 months of living expenses before quitting. It gives you some flexibility in setting your rate and selecting jobs.",1370185168

Its a battle of giant corporations to prevent any inheritance from reaching the heirs.  In the great feast at your financial corpse, will your wealth go to the banks, as mortgage interest, or the hospital, or the assisted living... they're all going to be pretty pissed off if the cruise ships start competing on their turf.  So expect some ""journalism"" aka marketing news releases about horrible cruise ships.<p>Given that multi-industry business model, how long do you think it would take until cruise ships join that business model?  If the residents are not kicked out off the ship until they're utterly destitute, that cruise ship operator is leaving money on the table.<p>Its like arguing about how a hospital room costs more than a motel 6 room.  Well, duh, you're not going to squeeze blood from a rock at a motel.<p>What sucks about this for everyone, aside from the injustice of it all, jackals at a corpse, etc, is that the new business model is completely incompatible with the old business model.  When my wife and I got married, long ago,  we went on a fun honeymoon cruise.  This option will be removed with the new business model.

5808712,comment,5802517,5808443,1,0,hga,,,"Obviously I disagree (although I don't think our disagreement is very large), I would say the truly essential parts were written by Gosling, and that RMS and company's biggest value adds were on top.  Hmmm, I suppose that it might be a bit like ""GNU/Linux"", except the gcc etc. tool chain makes the argument for the latter stronger.<p>Without reviewing my Finseth, what is there besides buffer management and its linked redisplay, built in commands (a lot of which were copied, like my favorite marker of backup-by-copying-while-linked, which in the '80s was to my fairly extensive knowledge unique to Gosling EMACS), keymappings and the extension language?  (Half my professional work in the '80s was on many different versions of EMACS, and I believe I worked on every significant UNIX one, although only Steve Zimmerman's CCA Emacs was a real competitor to Gosling/GNU EMACS as machines got enough memory.  Note when I say ""worked on"" I might mean nothing more than porting; today's young whippersnappers are spoiled by the Linux mono-culture and/or modern package systems :-)<p>You say the first two ""were tricky to get right"" ... you've got that right, back in those days when resources were dear and performance was critical (Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping :-), they were in my opinion the hardest parts, especially since the superiority of the buffer gap vs. linked lines wasn't necessarily intuitive, and didn't the main file of the Gosling redisplay code have a skull and crossbones at the top?  Although I'll admit to some bias since buffer management on the PDP-11 and non-VM PCs and 68000 workstations was problematic, in this case especially for a code base that started on a paging super-minicomputer (the VAX).  Once you had those, building on top of them is fairly obvious, and a if not the largest part of the quality was a matter of taste, where RMS was vastly superior to Gosling, from using ""standard"" keymappings to a real LISP.",1370184864

5808702,comment,5806100,5808495,1,0,gus_massa,,,"The relation between volume and mass for most solid in asteroids are:<p>* mostly water or ice: 1 g/cm^3<p>* mostly rock: 5 g/cm^3<p>* mostly iron or metals 8 g/cm^3<p>So density range of the usual solid material of asteroids is only ~10. This asteroid has a very low gravity. So maybe jumping from it can put you in orbit.<p>The easy way to understand what is imagining that you can turn off the gravity force between the asteroid and its moon. Now you have two independent asteroids that are orbiting around the sun. Both have almost the same position and velocity, so both have a very similar orbit. They will travel together for a long time, but the differences in the orbit will began to accumulate and they will start to slowly come apart.<p>Now turn on the gravity force between them. It's a small correction to the independent orbits but they are not separating very fast so a small force can keep them together. If you stand up in the bigger asteroid then the bigger asteroid will look like a moon.<p>(A better method to calculate the apparent orbit of the moon is to use a reference system that is fixed to the center of the asteroid. It's accelerating, so most of the gravity force of the sun cancels, but there are some tidal and centrifugal effects.)",1370184702

5808697,comment,5806006,5807675,3,0,nknighthb,,,"Yeah, that makes sense. The US annual death rate is 8.39 per 1000[1]. The newest ship in Carnival's inventory holds up to 3,690 passengers[2].

I can always throw on a cut of CTS or CTO to get a near-match to the predominant ambient, and that, too, gives me a known colour temperature so RAW processor presets (or batch applications of adjustments or stored camera profiles if I'm using, say, a Color Checker Passport) can work just fine. The flash makes the diffeerence between taking your subjects to where the light is ""good"" and making good light happen where your subject happens to be. (Completely killing ambient means losing the context, which may be a good thing or a bad thing.)<p>A more sensitive and efficient sensor may make portable continuous light sources more practical in the field (modulo photon shot noise  no sensor can make light a less probabalistic phenomenon), but it doesn't eliminate the need to make good pictures under sometimes unfavourable circumstances.

5808694,comment,5807935,5808159,2,0,6d0debc071,,,"Not for what it's meant for, but how they used it is.<p>One of the main things you have to remember is that when people try to do something quickly they have to apply more force to move their limbs, which requires that you apply more force to stop your limbs as well. And getting high peak forces in place with just the right timing to stop perfectly on a specific point in space rapidly becomes more difficult the faster you're moving.<p>You can even see it if you look at people learning to draw a gun quickly to fire it at a target: they'll overshoot their target slightly and then settle on target. It's one of the reasons for the old saying 'Fast is fine, but accuracy is everything.'<p>I've digressed slightly, but the point is that it's the same for everything, including user interfaces: to do anything quickly people need either a ridiculously high degree of repetition, large hit boxes, or some sort of immediate feedback that they use to trigger a response that does something. (Like, you can type without looking at the keyboard fairly easily, but you can't type without looking at the keyboard on a tablet as easily - at least not without really good correction software - because it doesn't give you the same sort of feedback.)<p>Related, this is why the better shooter players often turn their mouse sensitivity way down. It's also why, when you're designing a user interface for a program you want the most commonly used options against the edge of the screen - since when someone flicks their mouse there they hit an effectively infinitely deep hit box. (Unless they're on a multi-monitor setup =p )<p>Stylus interfaces have pretty much always been designed around using the stylus to hit small targets - that's one of the reasons why they used it rather than your finger, so that they didn't have to re-write large portions of their interfaces. And when you do that you pretty much kill usability because there's little real tactile feedback to allow you to fine-tune what you're doing so you have to be looking at the device and taking your care over where you're placing the stylus. It takes forever.<p>To an extent, people did try to get around that sort of issue with handwriting recognition for text input. However, there's also an element of resistance that you get with pens and an even greater extent with pencils that you don't get with a stylus, which allows you to be more careless in how you apply force. Writing on tablets is messy and large, (and the translation of the writing into text is inexplicably bad.)<p>It's also worth mentioning that you can hold your arm much more loosely when you're not holding a stylus. As any half-decent boxer will tell you, tension makes you slow. So, again, that's an advantage for the no-stylus camp since you don't have to hold you arm in a particular way to keep the pen in the right position.<p>So, yeah. They're not bad, for what they're meant to do - mainly sketching. But to bypass not having an interface designed for touch, and to bypass having awful implementations of touch screens, they're the kiss of death. You can sketch with them, you can take (usually messy) freehand notes. But if you're going to be operating an interface entirely off them, then that interface is going to have to be large - and if it's going to be large fingers are better because you get better (though still not great) tactile feedback and you have that absence of tension.<p>And all this is when the stylus is good, mind, and doesn't require you to click on the icon for a bit to get it to register.",1370184579

We had an ItMegaMeet in Bristol yesterday which sponsor companies used for recruiting.<p>I too would be surprised at how little some CS students know about web development and testing-- if I hadn't sat through a web tech unit so outdated that those of us with some experience could easily have done a better job.

Nothing beats Emacs/Vi for normal text editing, but since DrRacket was written with one purpose only, namely editing Racket code it has a few tricks up its sleave.<p>Syntax checking while you edit your code, means that any errors you make are highlighted immediately. This also catches misspelled identifiers.<p>After syntax check you can right click any identifier to rename the identifier (which automatically changes all occurences of the identifier in the file). The renaming even respects lexical scope.<p>You can easily jump to the file where a identifier is defined (I love to see how things in the builtin libraries are written).<p>DrRacket will display bitmap and other image values directly in the REPL. This must more convenient than seeing <struct: bitmap>.<p>You can even change the default REPL printer, to print your own user defined values using gui elements.<p>One of the most impressive features is how precise the error messages are reported. This goes for both standard errors, but not the least when macros are involved. If you compare the error reports you get from a few errorneous macros in DrRacket and in a standard Racket implementation, you'll see that you can save a lot of time if you use DrRacket.<p>And while at it, don't forget to try the macro stepper...<p>Oh!

It has no practical force on its own. If the phrase were ""in USA we trust"" it would have the same affect. In fact, the word ""Unamerican"" was used interchangeably with ""godless"" when it was at its height, and atheism wasn't even close to requisite for being labelled such.",1370181726

But the reason coffee is so cheap is that there is an oversupply - artificially raising the prices extends the problem, it doesn't solve it (by making some farmers realise they can compete better by switching crops).<p>If you want to help, buy expensive, high end coffee - most of it will be Fair Trade anyway, so I can't say ""instead of Fair Trade"". But getting the default, supermarket brand coffee that's 10% more expensive than the non-Fair Trade option damages more than it helps.<p>Also, I remember reading somewhere that Fair Trade places some irrelevant constraints on suppliers, such as the size of the supplier. I can't find a reference, so it might be wrong, but if it's not, then that suggests that pandering to western, urban romantic fantasies about rural life plays an inappropriate role in the scheme as well.",1370181661

6229941,comment,6229555,6229910,9,0,gamegoblin,,,"I had a pretty troubled childhood, and I surrounded myself in an armor of logic. I acted a bit like Spock, I guess. I tried to reject emotion and act only on logic. This did lead me to develop early mathematical and programming skills, but hindered a healthy worldview. I was firmly convinced that the universe was based in logic and that the meaning and reason of everything could be derived by logical thinking.<p>When I got older and moved away from home, I began to better understand &quot;The Absurd&quot; that Camus talks about. I had been struggling with the idea that I sought a logical reason for absolutely everything, but was unable to find one in many cases.<p>The acceptance of &quot;The Absurd&quot; allowed me to deal with the fact that meaning is often obscured or unattainable. I find it much easier to accept the world as it is without burdening myself with attempting (futilely) to logically explain everything. Things just <i>are</i>.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t reject logic at all; a question I was struggling with was &quot;logically, why should I value logic?&quot; Camus helped explain to me the absurdity of this question, and existence, and to accept that it would remain unanswered.<p>Camus also helped me to find joy in struggle. He says &quot;The struggle to the summits suffices to fill the heart of man. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.&quot; I now accept that there isn&#x27;t any deeper meaning to struggle and it&#x27;s important to live in the moment. Everyone is struggling in their own way. Everyone is struggling for their own desires, and at the deepest level, there is no reason for it.<p>Another book I recommend for the same reasons as above is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.",1376765931

Companies have many options on how to respond to unofficial use:<p>- cracking down on unofficial users == chasing down pirates<p>- attempting to control unofficial use (probably at the cost of normal usability) == DRM<p>- embracing unofficial users == the &quot;piracy as free marketing&quot; view<p>- viewing unofficial users as a sign of a specific weakness in the product == the &quot;piracy as a service problem&quot; view<p>I suppose that would make the original reverse engineer similar to someone who cracks a game&#x27;s DRM?",1376765920

Decompressing the entire block just to retrieve one column of one row is crazily expensive, especially as the decompression cost goes up as the block size goes up. There is also the problem of deciding whether to store compressed blocks in the buffer cache (slow), decompressed blocks in the buffer cache (wastes ram) or to have a cache of uncompressed blocks (the InnoDB approach, which kind of combines both problems). I think that format-aware page or column compression (like Oracle, SQL Server or ESENT) is far more effective.]<p>I guess that this has gotten way off topic but I am glad there are people out there doing exciting new things in the B-tree space.

6229918,comment,6228265,6228735,1,0,gwu78,,,"It sounds like what you want is &quot;CaaS&quot;.  Connectivity as a Service.  Specifically, connectivity that allows unrestricted two-way communication between end users.  &quot;Unrestricted&quot; as used here refers to restrictions arising from firewalls and NAT.<p>This sounds simple enough.  So why isn&#x27;t it a standard offering?  Only the connection.  Not the connection as part of an application that uses the connection.  Only the connection on its own.  IOW, what you see when you type ipconfig or ifconfig.  A connection that can then be used by any application.  A user might use have some applications use this connection (i.e. interface), but not others.  Her ISP-provided connection to the Internet and her CaaS connection to a small user-created VLAN overlay network can be separated on the logical interface level.  One way to envision this is the CaaS provider gives the user what she needs to make her own small overlay networks.  App developers might provide LAN-based applications to run on top.<p>Everyone reading this online has connectivity to &quot;the Internet&quot;.<p>But the vast majority of end users do not have connectivity that allows unrestricted two-way communication with each other.<p>Instead they must communicate through a third party such as an email provider (e.g. Gmail) or a website (e.g. Facebook).  Firewalls allow ingress traffic coming from such third parties.  Those third parties generally monitor and often analyze all traffic that passes through them, usually for commercial benefit.  Perhaps they store it as well.<p>Regardless of the security or privacy implications of this model, communication via a third party is often inefficient.  Why should two users in the same country who wish to send data to each other be required to send their data to a datacenter in a different country in order to communicate?<p>To take but one very basic example, consider email.  What if end users ran their own SMTP servers and these servers communicated directly?  There would be no need for &quot;email providers&quot;.  This is not so far-fetched as it might sound.  In the early days of the Internet, there were no commercial email providers acting as &quot;gatekeepers&quot; of email, as there are today.  And if you go back far enough, there were also no domain names nor centralized pseudo-authorities (ICANN and its &quot;authorized&quot; registrars), who constitute an additional gatekeeper.  As it stands today, you generally need both a preferred IP address and a registered domain name to reliably send email, not to mention the permission of your ISP.  There was much less centralization and control in the early Internet and it was far more fun (and I would argue far more useful).  Email users could communicate based on mailbox name and IP address, and without involving third party SMTP servers.  Imagine the simplicity.<p>Connectivity as a Service could make decentralized, user-controlled email again possible for subscribers of different ISP&#x27;s.  It could also make many other otherwise &quot;impossible&quot; Internet uses possible.  I posit CaaS could increase the value of the Internet as a whole.<p>Internet centralization and its incumbents may be ripe for disruption.  We might innovate toward more decentralized uses of the Internet than centralized ones.<p>Then again, CaaS may not be what you want.  I may have misinterpreted what you were describing.",1376765452

It could give the NSA time to build a counter story (parallel construction :-) which would be mitigate some of the impact, but it could also be construed as a form of &quot;responsible disclosure&quot; letting them know before the world knows so they can &quot;patch their systems.&quot;<p>I hope some creative writer is out there doing some exploration out there in a novel.

For one, neither of them tried to go to a higher authority to report wrongdoing -- that is the very first thing that a potential whistleblower must do, is handle things at the lowest level possible and allow the situation to rectify itself before taking matters into their own hands.  When that fails, then you escalate to higher authorities.  Secondly, Ellsberg surrendered himself to the court system willingly, knowing full well that he could face life imprisonment.  Manning was caught and brought to justice after having bragged on an AOL chat to someone about his &quot;hacking&quot;, while Snowden fled the country taking with him a trove of classified documents which could be in the hands of other countries, weakening any argument (to me) that he had the US&#x27;s best intentions at heart.  My argument about Snowden is that he knows so little about the programs he supposedly leaked -- I watched his interview and was astonished at the blatant lies in it (see my other post on <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5885846"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5885846</a>), not to mention him saying that he could wiretap any american (or even the president!) at any time.

Radar too, interestingly, and jet turbines. I&#x27;m not trying to be disingenuous: obviously getting radar up and running is less of a priority without WWII, and so on.<p>> Why would you develop computers when you had clerks and a typing pool and that worked perfectly well?<p>That particular conundrum took longer than the end of WWII to answer, though.<p>The interesting questions to me are whether something like a Manhattan Project are more of a distraction or a spur to people like Alan Turing and Johnny Von Neumann, and what would have happened to them and their field without the war and its spending. Maybe once the economy bounced back from the depression a computer industry would have begun quite a bit before it did on our timeline.<p>An awful lot of the visionary computer work was conducted with DARPA money over the years, but when you look at the career of someone like Robert Taylor, for example, you have to wonder if - in alternate history terms, I guess  - you don&#x27;t get Xerox PARC earlier or just in another context if you have less of the defense spending and more spending of our GDP on pure research.",1376763210

Lets take a look:<p>1. A study by Basili and Perricone found that routine size was inversely correlated with errors; as the size of routines increased (up to 200 LOC), the number of errors per LOC decreased (1984).<p>2. Another study found that routine size was not correlated with errors, even though structural complexity and amount of data were correlated with errors (Shen et al. 1985)<p>3. A 1986 study found that small routines (32 LOC or fewer) were not correlated with lower cost or fault rate (Card, Church, and Agresti 1986; Card and Glass 1990). The evidence suggested that larger routines (65 LOC or more) were cheaper to develop per LOC.<p>4. An empirical study of 450 routines found that small routines (those with fewer than 143 source statements, including comments) had 23% more errors per LOC than larger routines (Selby and Basili 1991).<p>5. A study of upper-level computer-science students found that students&#x27; comprehension of a program that was super-modularized into routines about 10 lines long was no better than their comprehension of a program that had no routines at all (Conte, Dunsmore, and Shen 1986). When the program was broken into routines of moderate length (about 25 lines), however, students scored 65% better on a test of comprehension.<p>6. A recent [sic!] study found that code needed to be changed least when routines averaged 100 to 150 LOC (Lind and Vairavan 1989).<p>7. In a study of the code for IBM&#x27;s OS/360 operating system and other systems, the most error-prone routines were those that were larger than 500 LOC. Beyond 500 lines, the error rate tended to be proportional to the size of the routine (Jones 1986a).<p>8. An empirical study of a 148 KLOC program found that routines with fewer than 143 source statements were 2.4 times less expensive to fix than larger routines (Selby and Basili 1991).<p>The 25 lines is just one of the studies, related to students of CS in particular. In general, it seems like the data indicates that somewhere between 100 and 200 is optimal for minimum errors per line, lowest cost to modify, less need to modify, and overall undesirability. So the &quot;short, 5-10 line functions&quot; seems to be not only entirely unsupported by empirical data, but actually harmful in general.",1376762888

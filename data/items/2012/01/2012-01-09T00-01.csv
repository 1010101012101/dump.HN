3441086,comment,3440510,3440510,3,0,srean,,,"What you broached open, intentionally or unintentionally, is a deep and a fundamental problem in machine learning. One could attempt to write a program that will guess (near) correctly. If the total number of hypothesis possible is finite the optimal guesser should take no more than log of the the size of the hypothesis class. The optimal strategy is to ask that example to be labeled that would cut down the hypothesis class in half regardless of whether the answer was true or not.<p>Things get more interesting when the hypothesis class is infinite and the guesser is no longer in control of which examples to choose. What is known is that if the examples are chosen randomly from the space of all possible examples, more specifically if the random samples are drawn independently from the same distribution, it is still possible to guess the correct hypothesis even if the hypothesis class is infinite. There of course are a couple of catches.<p>(i) The hypothesis class must have a finite VC dimension. What that means is given any n sample there can be atmost a n^d possible different labelings that can be induced on them.<p>(ii) the algorithm has to be allowed to be wrong on a certain non-zero percentage of the sample space with some non-zero probability.<p>These two hedges can be made arbitrarily small, just that the minimum number of training examples required will depend on how small they are. The reverse is also true, if the hypothesis class does not have a finite VC dimension the guessing problem is not learnable in this set up. This means one can come up with a scheme in which the learner will almost always fail to stay within the number of mistakes it was allowed. This learning problem set up is known as PAC learning. It stands for probably approximately correct.<p>The question you ask is different because unlike in the PAC set up the guesser has control over which example he/she wants labeled. Your setup is called active learning. If I remember correctly the case for the infinite hypothesis space is still open.<p>So in all fairness you do have to tell the interviewers what class the secret hypothesis lies in. Or to turn tables I can easily construct a hypothesis that you will not be able to guess.<p>An interesting case would be you tell the interviewee the token length of the little schemer'ish lisp code that encodes the secret hypothesis.<p>Quite unbelievably enough, there is another framework of machine learning problems where the choice of the example can be <i>adversarial</i>. Here of course it is not possible to arrive at the correct hypothesis. What one tries here is to do as best as the best of the ""experts"" you have access to. You of course do not know a-priori who is the best. This framework is known as online learning and is one of the most demanding, yet has simple algorithms that can solve it for certain hypothesis classes.",1326070604

3441074,comment,3437028,3440705,1,0,dalke,,,"tl;dr - the disassembly for the UCI position/fen parser in the Watkins PDF is clearly NOT a verbatim copy from Fruit. The Watkins disassembly from Rybka does not and cannot match the Fruit source code. I know you don't have much time, but please tell me where I made a mistake in this conclusion!<p>(BTW, I'm taking it as granted that we are talking about copyright issues. I accept that it violates the uniqueness requirement.)<p>I looked again at the parsing code analysis described in <a href=""http://www.chessvibes.com/plaatjes/rybkaevidence/RYBKA_FRUIT_Mar11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chessvibes.com/plaatjes/rybkaevidence/RYBKA_FRUIT...</a> . Did you realize that the two codes are different? Fruit does a strstr for ""fen "" and ""moves "" while Rybka does a search for ""fen"" and ""moves"". Note the difference in the trailing space. Is that a typo in the analysis? Yet there is such furor over the use of a ""0."" when it should be a ""0"". I'll assume that the analysis report (and associated disassembly) contain typos.<p>Note then the different call order between those two code snippets. Fruit calls ""board_from_fen"" only if fen != NULL, while in the disassembled Rybka code, it always calls the labeled ""board_from_fen(), for startpos"", and if v1 and v3 are not NULL, it calls the same function again.<p>Here's the quoted assembly code, as provided by Watkins:<p><pre><code>    0x406958: callq  0x40cc40             # strstr call for ""fen""
    0x40695d: lea    0x25d798(%rip),%rdx  # 0x6640fc ""moves""
    0x406964: mov    %rbx,%rcx
    0x406967: mov    %rax,%rdi            # rdi has fen strstr ptr
    0x40696a: callq  0x40cc40             # strstr call for ""moves""
    0x40696f: lea    0x25d74a(%rip),%rcx  # 0x6640c0 ""rnbqkbnr...""
    0x406976: mov    %rax,%rbx            # rbx has moves strstr ptr
    0x406979: callq  0x402980             # board_from_fen(""rnbqkbnr..."")
    0x40697e: test   %rdi,%rdi            # if fen != NULL
    0x406981: je     0x406998* [0x406995] 
    0x406983: test   %rbx,%rbx              # if moves != NULL
    0x406986: je     0x40698c
    0x406988: movb   $0x0,-0x1(%rbx)          # moves[-1] = 0
</code></pre>
The ""0x406979: callq  0x402980"" is always called, and it doesn't correspond to any code from Fruit.<p>This is important because in the Fruit code, board_from_fen is passed ""fen+4"", so fen cannot be NULL, which means ""callq  0x402980"" cannot be the same as ""board_from_fen"". This means the execution order difference in the above assembly code cannot be the result of a compiler optimization.<p>Which means this assembly code cannot be generated from a verbatim copy of the Fruit source code!<p>Not only that, but while my assembly isn't so good, it looks like only _one_ argument passed to the Rybka equivalent of board_from_fen, which takes _two_ parameters in Fruit. I'm guessing that the input board data structure in Rybka is a global.<p>Seriously? You count this as evidence for a copyright violation?<p>The author of the PDF calls that NUL insertion ""odd"". I couldn't understand why. It's something I've done in my own code. It's a very handy sanity check because it ensures there can be no buffer overrun. The PDF author goes on ""In any case, the fact that something is done here that (in the end) serves no purpose makes this a mentionable commonality.""<p>However, there's no indication of why there's no purpose to it.<p>So I downloaded the 2.1 code. I can tell the there's no purpose for it in Fruit now. There's no evidence, however, that it wasn't useful while bootstrapping the parser. There's no evidence for why it's not needed in Rybka.<p>Looking at the code, I realize that the PDF author omitted important code in the analysis. Here is the actual code from Fruit 2.1:<p><pre><code>   if (fen != NULL) { // ""fen"" present

      if (moves != NULL) { // ""moves"" present
         ASSERT(moves>fen);
         moves[-1] = '\0'; // dirty, but so is UCI
      }

      board_from_fen(SearchInput->board,fen+4); // CHANGE ME

   } else {

      // HACK: assumes startpos

      board_from_fen(SearchInput->board,StartFen);
   }
 </code></pre>
Notice the ""HACK"" section? It was left out of the analysis. This defines the ""startpos"" case if the fen string isn't present.<p>The equivalent code in the Rybka code could be easily written as:<p><pre><code>    parse_fen(startpos_board);  // Make sure we always have a valid board
    if (fen && moves) {
        moves[-1] = 0; // Ensure no overrun 
        parse_fen(fen);
    }
</code></pre>
Notice how it always parses the startpos, and then only if the fen is available does it parse the fen? This is different code. The order of operations is different, the function call parameters are different.<p>Here too I used a different coding style, so the code doesn't even look the same, even though the final assembly code will look very similar.<p>In other words, the command parsing does NOT ""exactly [match] that of certain parts of Fruit"", even though you say it does, because in Rybka:<p><pre><code>  - the strstr search strings don't end with a space
  - the ""startpos"" board is always parsed, instead only when there is no fen string
  - the parse function appears to take one parameter instead of two, and use a global data structure

</code></pre>
Please explain this discrepancy. How could that assembly come from the Fruit source code?",1326070287

You should think of it as a course of lifelong mastery, rather than as a simple skill that you can pick up over a month or two.<p>Today's self-help culture panders to short attention spans and desires for instant gratification. Everything's ""For Dummies,"" or ""In ___ Easy Steps,"" or ""The 4 Hour ___,"" or ""____ in 30 Days."" These are all constructs optimized to sell books; they're seldom legitimately helpful for the reader.<p>While it's indeed possible for an absolute novice to teach himself to code in a short timespan, the endeavor is bound to produce disappointing results. The sort of people who pave new ground, start impressive companies, and generally kick ass in the field, are the sort of people who see programming as a lifelong passion, and not a quick-and-dirty toolset to acquire.<p>It's about frame of mind, not longevity <i>per se</i>. I don't believe Norvig is implying that you can't do anything cool or useful before you've logged 10,000 hours. Rather, he's saying that the sort of person who does cool and useful things tends to be the sort of person who wants to stick around for the 10,000 hours.<p>At the very least, the phrase ""Teach Yourself to Program in Ten Years"" serves as a self-selection gate of sorts. People who see that line can be sorted into two types: 1) the kind who freak out, say ""wtf,"" or think ""wow, doesn't seem worth it,"" and 2) the kind who sort of chuckle knowingly, and proceed anyway. The latter are more likely to succeed, because they have the right mindset. They may not believe they need 10,000 hours, and indeed, they may not. But they see 10,000 hours as an intriguing challenge, rather than a barrier to entry.",1326068504
3440988,comment,3440035,3440380,2,0,anonLSD,,,"I relate very strongly to everything you say here. I've been diagnosed, hospitalized, and medicated on 3 separate occasions for major depression. In every case, I believed then and still believe that it was avoidable, and mostly situationally caused, regardless of the fact that it does eventually manifest as a severely disrupted and debilitating brain-state that could be characterized as a medium-term illness.<p>I am frequently exasperated by the discussions on HN. I think that the now-popular model of depression as an illness is better than the old-fashioned model of depression as The Blues, but I also think the newer model is still ignorant and harmful in new and different ways. EDIT: The view of depression as a medical condition may be a handy lens for allowing hospitals to deal with emergencies effectively, but for the suffering individual, it is woefully incomplete and even downright misguided. After dealing with it in my own life for 15 years, I've become convinced that Depression is a biopsychosocial [1][2] constellation of interacting phenomena involving bi-directional feedback between one's mind and one's life. And everyone experiences this feedback loop, even if it does not lead everyone into depression.<p>I've found it far, far more productive in my own life to analyse and try to improve the underlying causes, as opposed to medicating and _identifying_ with what I view as a temporary disorder, more similar to the flu than to a chronic disease. (Clarification: I support the use of medication to help with the ""bottom of the trough"" stage - that is, the temporary, crippling, chemical brain disorder phase. I am extremely suspicious of indefinite reliance on it, but I cannot rule out the possibility that some individual cases are so severe that long-term medication is the rational choice.)<p>I would add to your list that in this community, our ambitions are extremely high relative to most normal people. With very high ambition comes the likelihood of strong disappointment. I also find that being smarter than most people is a deep rabbit hole that makes a lot of social, professional, and authority-related interactions very weird. I think it's sad that it's so taboo here to talk about that issue in particular.<p>I wish more people would focus more on the nitty-gritty practical causes, like you do in your third paragraph. Despite my encounters with depression, I have spent the vast majority of my life being happy, active, social, fulfilled, unmedicated, and in every meaningful sense not depressed at all. I attribute this to a mix of choices about how I life my life, along with a fair amount of good luck. After all, we cannot control everything in life. There are gatekeepers. I've gotten jobs that led to incredible opportunities, relationships, and friendships. What if me or the interviewer had had an off day? What if they'd chosen someone else to interview me that I didn't hit it off with? A doctor can't address things like that - things that have huge impact. (A therapist can, sort of. I am a fan of CBT.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&id=12997&cn=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&id=1...</a>",1326068484

College GPA is a much better measure.<p>In terms of college GPA, if the admission system is biased in favor of a group, then the GPA of that group should be below average. If the admission system is biased against some group, then their GPA should be higher.<p>If AA nullified existing bias, then the GPA of black students should be more or less the same as the GPA of white students. Is this the case?<p><i>The only way a point system admission policy would not be discriminatory is if low level education results were not derived based on racial bias.</i><p>If true, this suggests that there should be a gap between low level education results and standardized test scores (which are immune to racial bias, since the scantron doesn't know the race of the person filling in the bubbles). Does this gap exist?<p>I.e., do black students have systematically low GPAs, but SAT scores comparable to whites/asians?<p>Similarly, if you want to minimize racial bias in the system, you should favor standardizing testing standards as much as possible - i.e., focus more on SAT and AP, less on GPA.

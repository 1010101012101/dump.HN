There&#x27;s very little chance of having a respectful conversation about this topic, so I should just move on silently. Shortly, I will. But not before suggesting that, respectfully, perhaps there&#x27;s another way to approach the problem?<p>You currently have one downvote, and it isn&#x27;t from me, but I feel so strongly repelled by your comment that I can understand the impulse to click the arrow and try to forget what you&#x27;ve written.<p>> Apple wants parents to police their iPads by hand instead.<p>I don&#x27;t think Apple takes a strong position on parenting at all -- but if they did, and it was the position you describe, I would be emphatically in agreement with them.

Therefore there are several ways to define the notion of velocity.  One of them is the <i>group velocity</i>, which intuitively is the speed of propagation for the &quot;shape&quot; of the wave, as opposed to the <i>phase velocity</i>, which is the speed propagation of its &quot;zeros&quot;.  There is a quite extensive Wikipedia article on the subject, check it out:\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_velocity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_velocity</a><p>Basically this ArXiv article shows that when a light beam has an unusual spatial shape, its group velocity can become measurably slower than light.  The group velocity is usually equal to the actual speed of photons, so if it&#x27;s still the case here, the authors have shown that in certain conditions  light can propagate in vacuum slightly slower than it usually does.",1421647089

(1) Directly through NTP (2) the adjtimex syscall, (3) the ntp_gettime call. I found it hard to find many codebases using the proper NTP. In fact codebases that need reliable time, like Cassandra and OpenLDAP. don&#x27;t use NTP time APIs to check whether the system clock is in sync, or to get accurate time. Even if we were to make PTP accessible to the world, it would be some time before its usage actually became ubiquitous.

The chance that an American programmer will work on software harmful to humanity is quite small. The chance that a North Korean programmer will do so is massive.

At some point, a threshold is reached where a student is more likely to use the knowledge to harm than to help. This threshold depends on the skill and the student.<p>To use a hypothetical: Would you condone someone teaching particle physics in North Korea? How about biology? Chemistry? Turbine engineering? Teaching any of these would probably increase North Korea&#x27;s ability to threaten and harm its people and the rest of the world. It&#x27;s sad that this is the case, but it&#x27;s hard to argue otherwise.<p>Unfortunately, I seriously doubt education will help free North Korea. If you read the stories of defectors, you&#x27;ll find that almost everyone in universities is indoctrinated. Also, because of how people are encouraged to report each other, no underground network of dissenters can exist. Even if 90% of North Koreans wanted to overthrow the government, anyone who voiced dissidence to a few friends would likely be reported and thrown in a prison camp (if not outright executed), along with their family. It doesn&#x27;t take much to control many.<p>I really wish it was as easy as, &quot;Education is good.&quot; But there can be dire consequences to actions, even ones as typically benign as teaching others.

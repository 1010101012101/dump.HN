Now, if the OS needs to remove a suspended application from memory in order to free up RAM for a foreground application, that will involve the processor and so use some power, although I would imagine a small amount. If a suspended application is removed from memory and then needs to be restarted when it is next used, that will also use the processor (and the flash storage), which will require power.  So leaving memory allocated for suspended apps can have an effect of battery life, although not directly because of the memory itself using power.",1325586986

Where I live (Texas), these employees have both civil service rules and a union (so they are arguably double-protected) while other public employees--except teachers--have neither and are at-will employed.

You must have noticed that there's another company using Phonify.com (no e).  You're going to get in trouble with trademark infringement if you launch with this.

[insert flashing red light]  Now maybe the other company won't have a trademark, in which case maybe you could use this, but then you can't trademark it yourself.

Note that the Wordpress people have a strong interpretation of the GPL (that is they assert that all plugins are covered under GPL and must be $free) though.

3. If they sent layoff notices to everyone, when they found out how many slots they had left, they would have to take teachers back by seniority rather than merit.
4. So they sent termination notices so they could hire back whoever they wanted.<p>Now, as I said, I don't know the backstory. This may be an attempt by a controlling superintendent to get rid of a faction that disagrees with him.<p>But from the facts in the story, it looks more like a union that negotiated a contract more in the interest of the senior teachers than in the interest of the school district or the students.

The rumor mill says that in recent years we can expect a 0-5% raise in salary depending on job performance and how well the company did that year. Does being a new graduate with less than a year of experience change anything? I haven't been working here for very long (~10 months) but become significantly more productive/valuable each week. For tasks which do not require intimate knowledge of the legacy codebase I feel I am at least as productive as most of the more senior developers on the team but my salary is still below the industry average.<p>According to the 2009 Alberta Wage and Salary Survey, (best resource I've found but still fairly vague) Albertans in the Computer Programmers and Interactive Media Developers occupational group earned from $16.83 to $113.22 an hour. The average wage was $38.17 an hour. Say I start at ~$25/hour. How much experience will I need before I can start to expect making the 'average salary'? Perhaps it is more of a meritocracy where whoever is the most productive is rewarded?<p>Another question: Word on the web is that companies like Google and Apple don't compensate well, but all evidence I've seen says otherwise. How to explain this discrepancy? It was only last week that a very large number of people on Reddit and HN were discussing how challenging it is to break 6 figures as a developer. Based on what I've seen the tech giants (Google, Microsoft, Apple et al) actually seem to offer the highest compensation in the industry.

Also, I would recommend against using the UITabBar for selection or control, as it is generally associated with completely separate views. It should at least be styled differently, so that people don't think of it like, for example, the clock app. This relates to the settings selection... you can select it, and then remove the view with 'x', but settings is still highlighted. Finally, I'd recommend adding background audio support and better resume from close functionality.<p>Just my 2c, overall its a well executed app.",1299352318

2292067,comment,2291534,2291534,0,0,drallison,,,"I think there are a number of possible sources for the observed phenomenon.  Students find it very difficult to get started.  Students also find it hard to abandon code preferring to try to make poorly structured and thought through code rather than starting over.  Finally, students find it hard to invent the abstractions that they need to solve large problems from whole cloth.  Programming classes often concentrate on the details of expression and ignore the issue of using them to create patterns and abstractions to solve real problems.<p>One way you can improve things is to provide a framework for each of the assigned problems, either a program with stubbs or a working program which can be adapted to solve the assigned problem.  I don't know how you teach students to throw away code rather than trying to make it work.  Finally, teach programming rather than the programming language.<p>I also have found that having many small assignment works better than having a few larger projects.  When I taught beginning programming I assigned on or two small programs per class meeting whereas the other sections had three larger projects.  It is also useful to have the small assignments provide a library of abstractions (procedures) which can be used in later assignments.  I also think it is useful to teach test focused programming where student need to present tests which validate their program as well as the program.  These days I'd be tempted to require students use one of the source code control systems, probably Mecurial.",1299352250

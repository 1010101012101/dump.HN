2267329,comment,2267205,2267205,0,0,shaddi,,,"Some good points here. A couple thoughts:<p>- If, for some reason that I can't really conceive of, you wanted to connect to a far-away access point, you'd need a highly directional antenna (due to RF physics). Doing this actually makes direction finding extremely challenging, for the same reason you can't see a laser from the side (unless it's super high power and has something to reflect off of, which is unlikely to be the case in the wifi scenario).<p>- End-to-end encryption plus an anonymization mechanism like Tor seems to me to be pretty impervious to attackers, assuming the implementation of your encryption and anonymization are both correct (which, admittedly, is a big if, but is not a /fundamental/ issue; you could envision a system engineered to be correct). If you have a secure, trust-worthy, out-of-band mechanism for exchanging keys with whoever you want to talk to, even if someone owns the infrastructure you're using they won't be able to decrypt your communication, or know who the source and destination are if you're using an anonymization mechanism. This also assumes you trust the person you're communicating with, etc.<p>I'd love for someone to correct my understanding of this if I'm wrong.",1298782610

I have no interest in picking a fight, but for the benefit of other HNers because this really matters for their businesses: there is definitely a point in brand value where the rules change.  A one-man operation who pulled a BMW would get terminated without a second thought and would find it very, very difficult to get their old rankings back.  Google can't do that to BMW because if BMW can't rank for auto-related queries in Germany then Google looks stupid.<p>(Public sanction like the BMW thing is more a messaging tactic than anything else.  I mean, case in point, we're talking about a single identifiable incident prominent enough to be mentioned in the mass media in a foreign country multiple years ago.  Ditto the incident where Google Japan got wrist-slapped for buying reviews.  What's the French phrase ""to encourage the others""?)",1298782513

If someone provides content of a better quality than others they ought to prevail.

Links are one way. Another way may be the language level which google has recently announced about websites. On that point, if google is able to determine the level of language a site uses, that is high level, medium or low, then surely google is able to determine the quality of the site?<p>Maybe, google is just too stuck in one paradigm and cant bring itself back and actually focus on the question that matters, how do you determine quality, rather than make some small tweaks which took the seo industry a grand one day to determine.",1298780785

Identify the structure, in pure information terms.<p>2. Get a basic idea of the layout, often using just a pencil and paper, or a quick mock-up tool like Balsamiq.<p>3. Implement the basic structure using HTML, typically as a set of divs nested in some reasonable way.<p>4. Implement the basic layout using CSS, just enough to position the divs in the right sort of places.<p>5. Add a bit of placeholder text/images and start styling the details as necessary.<p>The answer to your exact question, however, is ""I wouldn't"". I think the page you cited is horrible on just about every level, and if that's the kind of result you are looking for from using PS, you're welcome to it.",1298779794

Axure sucks for modeling mobile application interfaces, but hey, some dude figured out how to make a usable wireframing model with Keynote.<p>I've used all three methods, and each has their advantages and tradeoffs.

10101100,comment,10098561,10098561,0,0,logn,,,"> One particularly bad one is misunderstanding or misusing basic financial terms. I started noticing this in Y Combinator applicants a couple of years ago [...] Iâ€™ve seen people use GMV for revenue or refer to an LOI as a contract many times in the past year when talking to investors. This is a felony.<p>Not sure who the target audience is. If a business person is willfully deceiving people, let&#x27;s call that out. But if a programmer is using financial jargon they don&#x27;t understand, then let&#x27;s educate them.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to read this blog post and come away believing that if you use the wrong acronym accidentally the author thinks you&#x27;re a felon. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s an overstatement, but overall this could have been an article that was educational yet had a serious warning. Instead it kind of stirs drama and fear. That&#x27;s fine but I can&#x27;t help but compare PG&#x27;s essays which are a delight to read and get lost in.",1440205121

To expect the government to direct knowledge or funds towards something that <i>may</i> happen just seems... extremely unlikely at best. And honestly, I don&#x27;t disagree. I think we have a lot of problems that are present that we need to take care of. If these aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive then we should definitely be trying to take all of it serious, but if they are, well then we should focus on the problems that are happening now. But I guess it&#x27;s all relative.. does a dirt-poor person care about a something that could cause world-hunger in 30 years? I&#x27;d guess they are more worried about feeding themselves now. Is an ultra-wealthy mogul worried? Who knows, but I would assume they have less life-or-death problems occupying their thinking space, that maybe they are considering what may wipe out humanity in 100 years.",1440205110

There&#x27;s a lot of overlap but in my experience one isn&#x27;t a solid predictor of the other.  Furthermore, communication skills don&#x27;t take as much precedence until after you&#x27;re able to assemble a team to do the work.  Everyone wants to only hire programmers/engineers/whatever who are great at communicating but the impracticality of that is why team leaders, managers, etc exist.<p>You can probably find 10 software engineers to write the bits and pieces for the back-end software supporting your a shipping business and you can probably also find 10 with great communication skills.  When you want a team of 10 developers to write the code for a surface to air missile system who, by the way, will need to work with the engineering teams and understand how the overall system works and its intended implementation (in order to write workable code) you&#x27;re gonna have a tough time finding 10 people with all the qualifications you want and sacrifices will be made.",1440205043

10101093,comment,10099240,10100719,0,0,simonster,,,"It&#x27;s not entirely clear to me from the post whether the reason for changing the add-on API is to get rid of XUL/XPCOM (which was inevitable) or to limit what extensions can do for security reasons and/or to make AMO reviews easier.<p>If it&#x27;s really just about XUL/XPCOM, there are promises you (by which I mean Mozilla) could do to make developers happier:<p>1) That you&#x27;ll figure out what will replace XUL/XPCOM in Firefox <i>before</i> you force add-on developers to make similar changes. Perhaps there&#x27;s been some discussion of this at Mozilla since <a href=""https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/firefox-dev/2015-July/003063.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/firefox-dev/2015-July/003...</a> that I&#x27;m not aware of.<p>2) That functionality provided by non-XPCOM-based APIs currently available to extensions will remain available, e.g. OS.File and js-ctypes.<p>3) That there will be some mechanism for overlays for future browser UIs, beyond simple browser buttons.<p>If it&#x27;s about limiting what extensions can do, and not about the needs of new technology, I think a serious discussion needs to happen. There&#x27;s always going to be some compromise between security and liberty, and developers would probably have understood if told that they have to write things in certain ways so that the browser itself can be more secure. But telling developers that they can&#x27;t build what they want to build because Mozilla doesn&#x27;t trust them to write secure code is more questionable. A bad programmer can write insecure code with any extension API. (Chrome&#x27;s extension API didn&#x27;t protect against <a href=""http://blog.kotowicz.net/2013/07/jealous-of-prism-use-amazon-1-button.html."" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.kotowicz.net/2013/07/jealous-of-prism-use-amazon...</a>) I&#x27;m hoping for an add-on API that makes it easy to do common things in a secure way, but also provides an escape hatch for people who know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>Finally, I think developers would be happier if you finished the APIs and then gave them two years. Now we know we have 12-18 months and that Firefox will run Chrome extensions, but we have no idea what else, if anything, we&#x27;ll be able to do when Mozilla flips the switch and breaks our old add-ons. We have no idea whether we should start building on top of WebExtensions, switch to an extension + companion app, or just abandon Firefox entirely.<p>I would much rather this conversation in 2 years when the WebExtensions API is complete, or at least complete enough that we know what to expect from it, than play a game of duck hunt while you figure out the APIs and we figure out how to tailor our extensions to them, or if we will be able to at all.",1440205022

10101084,comment,10096990,10099743,0,0,rbehrends,,,"> Then strangely, you do exactly that two paragraphs later:<p>No. I&#x27;m drawing conclusions from different things, such as curriculum content, plus the huge body of existing research on teaching math in the US [1].<p>My larger point is that it&#x27;s pointless to treat statistics as a black box and try and make conjectures (or worse, massage the data to fit your conjectures), when there are known documented deficiencies.<p>> Also, your theory that teaching rote procedures causes poor performance is already refuted by Sanandaji&#x27;s article. It works just fine for Asian Americans, who perform just as well as wealthy Asians in Asia. Doesn&#x27;t that piece of data contradict your theory?<p>No. First, it merely shows that when you select the highest performing group, you&#x27;ll get a higher than average performance. The thing is, the same happens elsewhere, too. For example, the best-performing cantons in Switzerland (a country that is as ethnically diverse as the US [2]) had an average PISA score in math of around 560 in 2009, when the average was 531.<p>PISA scores are spread out over a pretty wide range. Poor teaching does not make you unable to perform at high levels, it merely handicaps you. Other factors can compensate for it, such as the known higher work ethic of Asian Americans and cultural valuation of intelligence and cognitive skills [3].<p>Second, he uses a composite score, while I&#x27;m specifically talking about math, where the US score is really bad (as opposed to, say, reading).<p>[1] To get started, look at what @tokenadult has written on this, e.g.: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5054856"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5054856</a> and <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8825364"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8825364</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_ranked_by_ethnic_and_cultural_diversity_level"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_ranked_by_et...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8416.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8416.full.pdf</a>",1440204732

Bear in mind, I&#x27;m typing this from an XOpen-certified UNIX machine, so obviously I wasn&#x27;t a total rwars ideologue (religious OS wars for those too young to remember the term).<p>The main issue was job completion predictability - most things we do with computers are fundamentally batch, and almost all the really, really important ones like bank account daily settlement and reconciliation are totally batch. There&#x27;s simply nothing to be done while you wait for the process to complete nor anything of higher priority that you&#x27;d want to preempt that task. So the question is, if the task is business-critical important or if it&#x27;s critical to major institutions such as the global economy - like, say, the Depository Trust Corporation&#x27;s nightly cross-trader settlement process which is, in fact, still a mainframe batch - why would you want the process to be anything other than a deterministic length of time for a fixed input? You&#x27;d be willing to commit a whole piece of hardware to getting the job done, right? As it turns out, that&#x27;s the reason. There are an awful lot of things that are more important than economical full-utilization of a machine, and most of those tasks are still carried out on mainframes, and usually they&#x27;re still done in batch.<p>There are a bunch of secondary reasons as well, though: a 3270 terminal ran in the thousands of dollars a unit in the 1980s; the network was really, really slow, and sharing the terminal server was worse than slow; if you were lucky(?) enough to have a token ring desktop and CM/2 on your machine so you didn&#x27;t need a 5250 death-ray CRT next to you, you were unlucky enough to be on token ring and good luck with that; at 9am when the world woke up and logged in, the entire SYSPLEX ground to a halt waiting for all the interactive logins to complete, even though folks would then idle most of the day... on and on and on, and all of those were issues with time-sharing systems that, for most applications, worked just as well if you punched a record card (I know, right? Punch cards...), put it in a stack, and handed it off to the data processing department at 5pm.<p>If I still had $X billion in transactions to clear a day where X > a number that would get me jail time if I screwed up, I would probably still do it on a zSeries mainframe running CICS and IMS but running almost totally in batch.

You probably have close to zero revenue/billings, so the main jobs are around payroll, taxes, a few accounts payable, and cash-flow projections.<p>You can (and should) hire an accountant to do the first 2, and work with your accountant to do the second 2, <i>but</i><p>1) Pushing all of payable through the accountant is an easy way to lose track of what your outgoings looks like, and end up with dangerously high expenses. At an early stage startup, the founders should be aware of every expense.<p>2) The founders definitely need to own the projections. Some help from an accountant is going to make a big difference, but they can&#x27;t do it for you.<p>But the more important issues are:<p>- <i>You aren&#x27;t likely to drag your external accountant into investor presentations</i>. You might (should) get the accountant to review the financials that go into the presentation, but they won&#x27;t be there to talk about them, so the founders need to know what they mean, and use the right words.<p>- <i>The average accountant cares about accounts, not investor terms</i>. You cannot really expect your external accountant (who you hired based on their ability to keep the books to an appropriate legal standard) to know whether that piece of paper in your drawer )that they had no part in producing) is a contract or LOI or MOU.

It does cover a handful of isolated toll roads and bridges, but mostly it just lets you drive in the carpool lane without having to actually carpool. This doesn&#x27;t dissuade people from driving, it just lets people who can afford it get places slightly faster. A real congestion charge avoids creating this two-tiered system by leaving no reasonable alternative route. You either pay the toll, drive 30 minutes out of your way, or take mass transit. Hopefully the latter.",1440201974

If ff is to remain relevant - signing extensions will need to come with a trust management framework. I might want to run extensions signed by Debian and myself - but not mozilla (in iceweasel).

If supply becomes tight, American producers can very quickly ramp up production and then shut it in again when demand falls.  There&#x27;s also no reason to believe that further technological innovation won&#x27;t further reduce the costs of American production, especially in tight oil.  Nobody thought that was even possible 15 years ago, today everyone in the country has an opinion on fracking.<p>Domestic producers have already shown tremendous resiliency in the face of the current glutâ€”the smart ones have learned to cut costs in the same way the Seven Sisters did during previous oil crises.  The fortress balance sheets of the majors will also shield the industry and allow continued R&D investment.<p>Furthermore, America&#x27;s mature capital markets will ensure that capital is available to the new industry of independent producers driving the surge in domestic production.

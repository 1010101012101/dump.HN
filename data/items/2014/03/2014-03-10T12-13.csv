7372619,comment,7371451,7372158,2,0,Spearchucker,,,"This problem has been solved. The idea is to use identity federation, claims-based authorisation, and a privacy-enhancing technology that lets the subject determine which claims to share with a resource provider.<p>Such a system can verify identity without divulging that identity. For instance, when you buy beer you need to prove you&#x27;re over 18. The barman doesn&#x27;t need to know your name, address, what vehicle classes you&#x27;re licensed to drive, or age. All the barman <i>needs</i> is to know that you&#x27;re over 18.<p>The reason nobody uses it is that it&#x27;s unpalatable to identity and resource providers alike.<p>Imagine a world where you could buy anything without the seller ever knowing who you are. Or your bank not knowing what you bought. Or your identity provider (government) not knowing where you&#x27;re using your authN credential.<p>The tech community doesn&#x27;t like it because even though it&#x27;s open source, it&#x27;s from Microsoft. And that it uses XML. So we keep on using broken identity systems like Persona and OAUTH.<p><a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/u-prove/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/u-prove/</a>",1394456244

The chances of this singular event happening and at the same time all safeguard of your body failing are minuscule, though. But the more events you have (the higher the radiation), the higher the chances that it will happen. This is what we basically know about radiation: it damages cells and for some events the natural cleanup doesn&#x27;t work. Basically you could say that <i>every</i> bit radiation is harmful, even the natural background radiation [1]. All guidelines and limits are based on the question whether the increased risk outweighs the possible gain. Early X-Rays had the problem of exposing the doctors to high doses, modern machines are designed with safety in mind. Still, patients and doctors wear protection when possible.<p>[1] to make matters worse, there&#x27;s different kinds of radiation: alpha rad which doesn&#x27;t even penetrate the skin, but is very harmful if dust is inhaled to high energy gamma rad that is basically impossible to shield without lead or other heavy metals around.

Instead, we always found the best parts were in the questions and discussions at the end of each talk - except this time was often cut off in order to make room for the next talk.<p>What we wanted was a smaller, more intimate event aimed at talking through the technology side of building startups. One didn&#x27;t exist, so we decided to do something about that and created Many to Many.<p>Many to Many is aimed at fostering group discussion instead of the traditional &#x27;one person talks to audience&#x27; format. There are 3 discussions topics per event, each discussion leader will open with a short (5m max) introduction, before opening up to a half-hour group discussion. The idea is that everyone shares their experiences, asks questions and learns from each other. We&#x27;ve been running this event since last July, and have had some amazingly positive feedback from people.<p>The event is mainly aimed at engineers interested in web/mobile startups in London, but we happily get designers and product people attending and leading discussions too! The event is free, and being a startup event, naturally pizza, beer and soft drinks are all provided :).<p>The next event is on Thursday 20th of March, and is held near Old Street, London, UK, the leaders and discussion topics this time are:<p>- Ollie Glass:\n   &quot;Turning hacks into products&quot;<p>- Rob Elkin\n   &quot;Communication between developers&quot;<p>- (final discussion leader TBC)<p>If this sounds like something that interests you, please do sign up on:\n  http://www.manytomany.co.uk/<p>Thanks!",1394454100

Simply triangulate using the known distance from earth to sun as half the side of a triangle.<p>For &quot;moderate&quot; distances one can rely on certain variable stars that always have a known brightness. Then when you locate such a star, note how dim it is and calculate how far away it would have to be to have that brightness level.<p>For &quot;far&quot; distances one can measure the red shift. That is to say, on the large scale everything in the universe appears to be moving away from us. Further away object move faster than nearby objects.

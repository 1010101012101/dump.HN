I have done exactly the activity evolution has programmed me to do to continue the species, regularly, for over 20 years.  Only twice did it result in children, and both times were conscious choices on my part.<p>However evolution knows how to face these disasters.  There is a small minority of people who have the option of birth control, who have all of the same economic incentives that I do, yet choose to have lots of children.  Their children are less likely to want to use birth control than mine.  Thanks to exponential growth, that minority that chooses to have children regardless will become a majority.  And after that point, voluntary birth control and economic incentives will not suffice to keep the population from growing.<p>This is literally evolution in action.",1355673584

In general, the planet can ""easily"" support the number of people we have. While I don't think there would be serious harm in a happy, voluntary reduction in the overall population, this isn't a sustainable long term (100's of years) trend.

Should individuals have the power to control what others do with the information that is publically knowable about them? I, personally, say no.<p>I think this is the third time I'll make this post on HN, but it's been relevant every time.<p>Privacy is not about having something to hide, or about keeping things secret. Giving the government the power to store all this data about you isn't bad because they might learn embarrassing things; after all, it will most likely only be read by a computer.<p>But it gives the government enormous power to make decisions about you -- decisions about whether you may take a commercial airline flight, get a security clearance, or even get a job -- without your knowledge or consent, and without you knowing how they make the decisions. It's not Orwellian, it's Kafkaesque.<p>In short, a lack of privacy gives the government the power to be even less transparent in its decision-making, and gives it yet more power over its citizens. It's not a question of discovering your fetishes or being embarrassed, and we shouldn't respond to the ""but I have nothing to hide"" argument as though their conception of privacy is right and having nothing to hide really is an excuse.<p>There's a rather good paper I can recommend on the subject:<p><a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565</a>",1355673318

If you want to have an informed discussion about gun violence you need to acquire at least a modicum of information about firearms, especially but not limited to different actions, <i>e.g.</i>, single-action, semi-automatic, and automatic.<p>Virginia Tech? 2 semi-automatic pistols.\nSandy Hook? 1 semi-automatic rifle and 2 semi-automatic pistols.\nUT Austin? 1 semi-automatic shotgun, 2 bolt-action rifles, 1 pump-action rifle, 2 semi-automatic pistols, 1 revolver, 1 semi-automatic carbine\nColumbine? 1 pump-action shotgun, 1 break-action shotgun, 1 semi-automatic carbine, 1 semi-automatic pistol.<p>What do those have in common? No automatic weapons.<p>Almost no crimes are committed with legally owned automatic weapons.

4928550,comment,4925663,4927757,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>As an aside, I know a lot of people here on HN find your comments to be overly aggressive</i><p>Many HNers (and this is a hard group to categorize, because there's still a lot of diversity of thought) are still in the honeymoon phase with the positive-sum promise of technology and the startup economy.<p>I believe in these things very strongly, but I'm also old and experienced enough to know that we, the good guys, have real enemies. They aren't stupid, and they're not weak. We seem to think we can out-compete them by being smarter, more productive, and earnestly working toward a better world. We act is if we'll be able to peacefully render them irrelevant and that they won't know what is happening (or care) enough to fight. Well, perhaps. Time will tell. I am not <i>yet</i> at the point of saying we need to take AK-47s against our corporate masters (please don't do that; your aim probably sucks and weapons are nasty things even when used well). However, I am also not optimistic enough to believe that they will surely opt for graceful decline and let us build this better world that we want. Perhaps they will, content to be very rich (in a world whose prosperity begins to dramatically increase, probably around 2025-40, rendering them less <i>relatively</i> wealthy and powerful) but increasingly irrelevant. Perhaps they won't. My experience with the upper class is that they are mean-spirited, ethically depraved people. Their weak point is that they underestimate us, because we're less than human to them, and because they see us as intellectually inferior. However, if we underestimate <i>them</i>, then we are making the same mistake.<p>Most of my HN ""enemies"" (and that's too strong a word, because I don't dislike them and they don't know me) are Googlers who were shocked when I exposed unethical management, in a very visible way, in October 2011. When you wave a whistle in the public (""whistle"" as in whistleblowing) some people act as if you're waving a gun, and especially those who can't stand to hear the truth about their utopia. This reaction is ridiculous, because a lot of the people who get up in arms and fight whistleblowers have nothing to fear. They are too in love with the Woodbury with the quaint coffee shops, not the real Woodbury with the fascistic Governor and the zombie gladiator fights.<p>What's sort of amazing about whistleblowing is that you don't get the worst opposition from the powerful people you are exposing. They know they're doing wrong and will often make <i>some</i> concessions (but rarely enough). The mindless and often vicious opposition that you get is from other peasants who are shocked and upset at what appears to be going down. In the Philippines, this is referred to as the ""crab mentality"", whereby crabs in a bucket prevent each other from escaping and they all die. That's what you see when subordinate employees go to the mat to defend unethical managers who wouldn't lift a finger to do anything for them.",1355673045

It's a lot of fun to do.<p>I cannot understand for the life of me why the focus here is on guns. Americans have had ready access to guns throughout America's history, but mass shootings are a comparatively <i>new</i> phenomena that are sadly becoming increasingly frequent, so 'ready access to guns' doesn't seem like a particularly compelling explanation. Neither does the influence of media reporting, since this reporting is worldwide but the mass shootings remain predominantly American.<p>As an immigrant to America, I wonder if the emphasis on individualism and dynamism that makes America so appealing also comes with costs. People here may be more likely to take bold action to solve their problems (or perceived problems), and this includes the segment of the population that's criminal, evil, or mentally ill.<p>Now if so, this is nothing new - America's been a dynamic culture of entrepreneurs and dreamers long before this outbreak of mass violence. However, America previously combined this dynamism with stronger forms of moral education and social control - primarily religious ones, but also bonds to local communities and extended families. The gradual weakening of <i>these</i> bonds has coincided with the rise of mass shootings.<p>To sum up, America's individualistic, energetic culture minus a strong moral foundation and community ties = very bad news.<p>Of course, this is just my own theory, and it's probably wrong. Societies are complicated things. But I do wish people would dig about a bit more under the cultural hood before reflexively pinning the blame on firearms.",1355671104

I think a better generalization is that many psychiatric disorders are caused by genetic abnormalities (or clusters of abnormalities, or complemented with epigenetics), but that the potential pool of candidates is vast.  It only takes a few rotten eggs in the whole batch to ruin things.<p>It's like a rocket.  You need all the parts of a rocket to work or you won't get off the ground.  If you are really unlucky, it may even explode<p>With psychiatric disorders, it's similar.  Break a few choice genes and the whole system goes to shit.  But unlike a rocket, it keeps <i>working</i>, just not in the fashion that other brains works.  So you get some kind of disorder like schizophrenia or bipolar.<p>I was involved in a few projects where they were mapping schizophrenia with SNPs.  Looking at the data, it's clear that some individuals cluster around certain SNPs...but most of them are scattered everywhere.  Lots of things can cause schizophrenia, because it really isn't a single disease but a set of common symptoms.",1355670982

Nothing seems to work.\nI remember that.\n> A few weeks ago, Michael..threatened to kill me\nI did that too.<p>I wonder if a nice beating would have done you any good. I have one anecdotal story.<p>My older brother was uncontrollable at the age of 9. He threw a rock at my even older brother straight at his head. Nobody could tell him what to do. Once he run away from home on a bus heading to a big city. Had he not been spotted by some friends of the family we may never had seen him again.<p>When they returned him my grandfather advised my mom, who has a strong temper, not to scold him. So she did not. From there after he became even more uncontrollable. And now he would threaten my mother that he would run away if he didn't get his way.<p>Seeing the truth in his eyes my mom realized that one of this days he was going to run away and this time it might be for good. So this is what my mother decided to do as a last resort:<p>She tied him up from the feet to a branch of a tree. Basically he was hanging upside down. My mother told him that since he was going to run away she'd rather kill him so that at least that way she would know where he was. I believe at this moment my mom took out a belt, she might've hit him once or twice with it, and asked him if he was going to run away. My brother, as you can imagine, was terrified and crying and telling my mom that he would never do it again.<p>Outcome: The problem was fixed. He became more subdued and never threatened to run away.<p>Now my brother is a grown man, in his 40's. He has a family,  a house and is a productive man of society. Overall he turned out pretty good.<p>Mind you that it wasn't like my mom would abuse her children with beatings every other day. But you could definitely expect a beating if you really misbehaved. Not once did I get a beating nor do I remember any of my sisters getting a beating. Just trying to establish that she was not an abusive mother.<p>All of this happened south of the USA border.",1355670844

4928454,comment,4923914,4926968,4,0,dalke,,,"Okay, I looked at some of the ""reasonably unbiased job of grading his own predictions."" I'll pick one, for lack of interest in expanding upon everything.<p>He writes: Personal computers are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, and are commonly embedded in clothing and jewelry. When I wrote this prediction in the 1990s, portable computers were large heavy devices carried under your arm.<p>But I gave two specific counter-examples. The JavaRing from 1998 is a personal computer in a ring, and the TRS-80 pocket computer is a book-sized personal computer from the 1980s, which included BASIC. So the first part, ""are available"", was true already in 1999. Because ""are available"" can mean anything from a handful to being in everyone's hand.<p>Kurzweil then redefines or expands what ""personal computer"" means, so that modern iPods and smart phones are included. Except that with that widened definition, the cell phone and the beeper are two personal computers which many already had in 1999, yet were not ""large heavy devices carried under your arm"", and which some used as fashion statements. I considered then rejected the argument that a cell phone which isn't a smart phone doesn't count as a personal computer, because he says that computers in hearing aids and health monitors woven into undergarments are also personal computers, so I see no logic for excluding 1990s-era non-smart phones which are more powerful and capable than a modern hearing aid.<p>There were something like 750 million cell phone subscribers in the world in 2000, each corresponding to a ""personal computer"" by this expanded definition of personal computer. By this expanded definition, the 100 million Nintendo Game Boys sold in the 1990s are also personal computers, and the Tamagotchi and other virtual pets of the same era are not only personal computers, but also used as jewelry similar to how some might use an iPod now.<p>He can't have it both ways. Either a cell phone (and Game Boy and Tamagotchi) from 1999 is a personal computer or a hearing aid from now is not. And if the cell phone, Game Boy, etc. count as personal computers, then they were already ""common"" by 1999.<p>Of course, what does ""common"" mean? In the 1999 Python conference presentation which included the phrase ""batteries included"", <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/ipc7/ipc7-slides.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/ipc7/ipc7-slides.pdf</a> , the presenter points out that a ""regular human being"" carries a cell phone ""spontaneously."" I bought by own cell phone by 1999, and I was about the middle of the pack. That's common. (Compare that to the Wikipedia article on ""Three-dimensional integrated circuit"" which comments ""it is not yet widely used."" Just what does 'common' mean?)<p>Ha-ha! And those slides show that I had forgotten about the whole computer ""smartwatch"" field, including a programmable Z-80  computer in the 1980s and a smartwatch/cellphone ""watch phone"" by 1999!<p>I therefore conclude, without a doubt, that the reason why the prediction that ""Personal computers are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, ... "" was true by 2009 was because it was already true in 1999.<p>As regards the ""obscure German R&D project"", that's not my point. A Nova watching geek of the 1980s would have seen the episode about the autonomous car project at CMU. And Kurzweil himself says that the prediction was wrong because he predicted 10 years and when he should have said 20 years. But my comment was responding to the enthusiasm of rpm4321 who wrote ""Predicting that self-driving cars would occur in ten years in the late 90s is pretty extraordinary, especially if you go to youtube and load up a commercial for Windows 98 and get a flashback of how primitive the tech environment actually was back then.""<p>I don't understand that enthusiasm when 1) the prediction is acknowledged as being wrong, 2) autonomous cars already existed using the 'primitive tech environment' of the 1990s, and 3) the general prediction that it would happen, and was more than science fiction, was widely accepted, at least among those who followed the popular science press.<p>""I strongly encourage you to fire up Youtube or dust off an old computer, and really try and remember exactly what the tech environment was really like in previous decades for the average consumer""<p>I started working with computers in 1983. I have rather vivid memories still of using 1200 baud modems, TV screens as monitors, and cassette tapes for data storage. I even wrote code using printer-based teletypes and not glass ttys. My complaint here is that comments like ""primitive"" denigrate the excellent research which was already done by 1999, and the effusive admiration for the predictions of 1999 diminish the extent to which those predictions were already true when they were made.",1355670708

This is a highly contentious claim, and I think you might need to justify that, with reference to mental health in particular.<p>In a comment above, where I discuss the policy of the states in Australia, I suggested googling 'bendigo mental health'. If you do that you will see a degree of specialisation that far exceeds your presumptive normalcy.<p>Events such as these do appear to occur in clusters, and this leads to complicated questions. And of course it has to do with mental health, unless you honestly believe that such acts can be carried out by well balanced, psychologically stable individuals.<p>Inurement by familiarity I would agree is a factor, but it cuts both ways. There was a mass killing in Australia which followed only one month after a mass killing event in the UK, where I live. Isolated individuals also require social connections, and the strange self esteem accessible through active association with like minded others, even if unknown personally to them, seems to play a part. It's never a wise move to allow mentally damaged people to join a nervous uprising against the incumbent ideology, that often is seen as part of the reason for their repressed state. Though it might seem tortured logic on these actors parts, I think one of the reasons these shooting incidents are somewhat peculiar to the United States is because these actors see it as a right to bear arms against their oppressors.<p>On the other hand, the response of the rest of society is critical to developing ways to resolving ways to avoid these events. Either you exert enough pressure to put the uprisings back in their box, to be modified by planned action in due course, or you eek them out into a system of redress that has the capacity to control.<p>Either way it is indeed a mental health issue from a public health perspective. And their right to bear arms is guaranteed in defence of their freedom, through logic that is strange and barely comprehensible to most of us.",1355670603

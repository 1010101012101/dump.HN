It would be nice to see a study of which children are happier though. Those in school socializing all day; or those at home socializing for an hour or two in the evening. You get to interact with a wide variety of people at school from many different backgrounds. You can learn a lot from that and it can help you in many ways when you enter the real world. Homeschooling you&#x27;re with your parents or a tutor all day and your social circle would likely be limited to those who live in your street. At this stage I think it&#x27;s impossible to say which scenario is better, there needs to be a lot more research done. Personally though I am very happy I was not homeschooled. I would have been educated well - maybe even better - but I think I would have missed out on a lot of important experiences.<p>More anecdotal evidence:<p>When I was 0-8 years old we lived in neighborhoods full of kids. Then we moved to a place with none. I was much happier in the first place because of the socialisation. It didn&#x27;t matter that the new places we lived were nicer or more convenient for certain things. I think this also hurt my social skills. I was pretty sociable at a younger age but compared with my peers my social skills have lacked since then. This can impact on interview performance, networking, etc.",1408297911

8189918,comment,8189669,8189669,1,0,angersock,,,"I saw the mention of COLLADA in the beginning, and prepared myself for the worst, and here it is.<p>Things I dislike about this:<p>0. <i>Not a single editor looks like they write games/do web programming for a living.</i> Their experience and expertise is questionable at best--and one of them is responsible for COLLADA.<p>1. <i>We don&#x27;t need shaders in our assets</i>. Time and time again we find out that assets are fed into tech that&#x27;s wildly changing, and having any prebaked assumptions about shading is a &quot;Bad Idea (TM)&quot;. This format would be more useful, for example, if it didn&#x27;t assume glsl, if it didn&#x27;t assume multiple rendering passes, and so on.<p>2. <i>Don&#x27;t have an &quot;extras&quot; or &quot;extension&quot; section.</i> There&#x27;s no reason that it should take a long time to extend a format, especially if its tightly-scoped and simple to being with. Adding this flexibility here leads to issues with shoving in special data, lazy exporters, hard-to-write importers, and so on. Just no. Stop. That&#x27;s why .OBJ has has such staying power--it is simple and non-extensible (barring weird shit like smuggling data into comments).<p>3. <i>Schemas are silly in this use case</i>. This is the Web, we don&#x27;t really use schemas in our JSON. This is a practice pulled over from XML, and honestly one that just smells to me like &quot;Oh, we had this in XML COLLADA...LETS DO IT IN JSON!!!!!one&quot;.<p>4. <i>The material system is vague.</i> It&#x27;s an overly complicated wrapper for what, I assume, would normally just be a JSON object of param:value pairs. Better question: when would this ever be used in a real application? Hint: <i>never</i>. You want a simple mapping of faces to a material ID, and then maybe a separate definition of those materials in, say, a simple format (which is not what this spec does). Usually, you just punt to the rendering pipeline anyways.<p>5. <i>They don&#x27;t specify a binary format</i>. This would be a useful thing to do, especially if paired with a decent reference parser. Punting that down to road means that they are forced to be overly generic in their notions of materials and animations and whatever else, without actually adding any value in terms of how to store the meat of the asset data.<p>6. <i>Cameras</i> are almost always determined by the application, and can be represented more compactly than they are here.<p>7. <i>Optional and default values are the devil</i>. No no no no. This format is intended for consumption by machines, and maybe by humans--if I have to read your spec to figure out why something is being set to what it is, I&#x27;m not going to use your format. Explicit >>> implicit for file formats.<p>~<p>I could go on, but why bother?<p>This just looks like a bad attempt to bring over the problems of COLLADA into JSON and then inflict it on web developers.<p>I&#x27;d much rather see people solving the problems that we actually have:<p>1. Make a simple binary/base64-wrapped format to handle static mesh geometry with material groups.<p>2. Make a simple binary/base64-wrapped format to handle animations and describe tracks. Go look at md5anim as a start.<p>3. Make a simple JSON format to describe a scene graph. Just nodes and translations.<p>4. Make a simple JSON format to describe all of the metadata associated with a scene--list of scene graph files, list of animation files, list of mesh files, list of materials files, and maybe grouped into device requirements (oh, on mobile, load <i>this</i> instead).<p>And so on. The idea is to have <i>simple</i> microformats that are straightforward to implement, standalone, and that compose nicely. COLLADA/glTF is not that.<p>Moreover, consider what we&#x27;re trying to accomplish here: little dioramas and markup (ala VRML), or assets that are actually going to be reused in different applications as content atoms (like images or sounds are).",1408297719

The Nazis even maintained the gold standard for international trade long after the other major economies had devalued their own currency, and much of the mobilization of their wartime economy came via inventive capitalist measures from the Reichsbank, Reich Economic Ministry, military-economic departments of the Oberkommandowehrmacht, and more.<p>Likewise the trusts were not only not nationalized (at least, at any great scale), but businesses and industry were forced to join specified cartels based on their market sector. It was through these cartels that the Reich enforced economic policy.<p>Most of the &quot;left wing&quot; economic policies that were enacted were emulated using good old standard &quot;right wing&quot; methods. Markets remained; instead of centrally planning economic output directly, the Reich simply regulated the market such as to achieve mostly the desired effect. Instead of banning refrigerators outright, the Reich simply failed to import enough iron ore to make civilian goods once the priority list for Wehrmacht and export needs had been filled.<p>Chemical plants that were <i>absolutely essential</i> for the Reich&#x27;s strategic needs were contracted to companies like IG Farben with profit guarantees and profit sharing agreements, methods that would be perfectly accept to almost any right-wing economist.<p>There were state industries too (Junkers, a strategic industry expansion program, a steel/coal production cartel, etc.) so it&#x27;s not as if Nazi Germany didn&#x27;t have traditionally left-wing attributes to it. But nor was it lacking in traditionally right-wing attributes or methods.<p>All of these methods were means to an end, as opposed to being taken from either a left-wing or right-wing palette of options because they were left- or right-wing.",1408297531

This is human studies 101.<p>As to science meaning what I think it does:<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/building_science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/building_science</a><p>> <i>That is scientific enough.</i><p>Spoken like a true psychologist. Observational studies without an effort to craft a testable, falsifiable theory, an explanation, for the observations is not science. If this were not so, astrology would be a science.<p>But since I can anticipate your reply, let me give you an example. Doctor Dubious invents a new treatment for the common cold. His treatment is to shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until the patient gets better. Sometimes the treatment takes a week, but it always works — the cold sufferer always recovers. So, why doesn&#x27;t Doctor Dubious get a Nobel Prize for his breakthrough?<p>The answer is that the procedure is only a description — shake the gourd, patient recovers — without an explanation, without a basis for actually learning anything or being truthful about the connection between cause and effect. It&#x27;s the same with psychology.<p>> What kind of evidence do you need for a &quot;clear conclusion&quot;, if you don&#x27;t accept decades of research, involving hundreds of thousands, if not millions of cases?<p>One study with a control group and scientific discipline, would be worth thousands of typical psychology studies that don&#x27;t try to move from description to testable, falsifiable explanation. As it happens, the NIMH has now accepted this view. In a recent policy change, the NIMH has ruled that the DSM, psychology and psychiatry&#x27;s &quot;bible&quot;, may no longer be accepted as the basis for scientific research proposals, on the ground that it has no scientific content:<p><a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/2013/05/nimh-wont-follow-psychiatry-bible-anymore"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.sciencemag.org/2013/05/nimh-wont-follow-psychiat...</a><p>But, since you think that the quantity of studies make up for their poor quality, will you also defend the many thousands of recovered memory cases on the same ground -- that, since there were so many of them, surely they must refer to something real? And that therefore Beth Rutherford really was raped by her father and forced to abort using a coat hanger -- until the day someone discovered she was a virgin?<p>Or how about Asperger Syndrome? A few years ago it seemed like a real thing, with thousands of confirmed diagnoses (for those of you who think counting cases makes up for poor discipline). Now, because of indiscipline and widespread abuse, it&#x27;s been voted out of the DSM and therapists are discouraged from using it.<p>> There are even successful treatments for it.<p>Yes, just as there is for the common cold -- see above. If you actually understood science you would realize that ADHD means precisely nothing until a cause is uncovered.<p>> ADHD has been established as a syndrome, and about as firmly as it gets in medicine.<p>Compared to a microscope image of a pathogen, followed by development of a vaccine, which either succeeds or fails, in a properly designed study <i>with a control group?</i><p>ADHD is located in the vast terrain of unscientific psychology, grouped with things that are discussed but for which there is no solid evidence nor known cause. The NIMH has taken the first step by denying use of the DSM in scientific research. The next step will be advances in neuroscience and the eventual replacement of psychology with neuroscience.<p>This doesn&#x27;t say there&#x27;s nothing to ADHD, or that a real cause might not eventually be uncovered.

Comments in the reddit default subs are bad enough when compared to the kind of discussion you see on HN, but comments on imgur are a mixture of the kinds of things you&#x27;ll see on 9gag or funnyjunk fused with some of the worst of reddit&#x27;s default subs&#x27; communities.

They rely only on non-intrusive ads, Reddit gold, and donations.<p>4chan is in an even worse state, and has also only been making money through their 4chan Pass semi-donation feature.<p>Imgur could have created a new subdomain for the &quot;new&quot; site, or could have setup some entirely different applications that integrate with the main site, instead of detracting from the main product. As a company, they have a right to do what they want to make money, but as users most of us will always keep moving to the best solution once the old ones start shooting themselves in the foot.<p>Companies whose business model is to provide only a single free service for a massive userbase will always have to balance revenue and user alienation. Reddit and Imgur are leaning on opposite sides of that scale at the moment.<p>Honestly, I would consider an acquisition (by Google or whoever) to be a much better solution for everyone involved compared to the things they&#x27;re trying now in desperation to get more revenue.",1408295284

Then save the &quot;profile&quot; for the process somewhere for next time it is invoked with firejail!

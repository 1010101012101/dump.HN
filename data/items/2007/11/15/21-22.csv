I probably would have sounded like that too at his age, but back in the pre-Web era there was no way for anyone to read what most 20 year olds wrote.  Now that people can start publishing so much younger, we'll have to learn to be more tolerant of various flaws of youth.",1195163876

He hasn't started the next Google and he hasn't written the next awesome Python API, but why fault him for that? He is trying, and by most measures, he is very successful.  <p>Your points:  <p>a - That's pretty impressive, at 13 what were you doing, and the rest of us?  <p>b - I don't know the specifics of the merger, but that happens all the time, and good for him.  <p>c - He is a good starter and most people go through many startups before they hit it big.  <p>d - That many people seem to like.  <p>This whole comment has nothing to do with hacker news or startups.

80368,comment,80178,80178,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I've used frameworks and written my own. Obviously what works better depends a lot on how similar your problem is to what the makers of the framework intended to solve. The dilemma is that as you build your app your problems become more specific to that particular app and you tend to gain less and less from the framework. Eventually the framework gets in your way. Not because it forces you to do it in a particular fashion, but because you feel compelled not to stray from the framework's path in the interest of consistency and simplicity. Unfortunately, the same may be true of your own framework creations, just the consequences are different.<p>Frameworks are great if you do a series of similar, straightforward projects like many contractors would do. A framework allows people to get acquainted with your code more quickly, so it's good for companies with high staff turnover. It also has a name that HR can put in a job ad.<p>If you roll your own, try to do it as a collection of independent libraries, not as a don't-call-us-we-call-you type of framework. That's my conclusion after many attempts at framework writing. It has always been the case that some parts were good and others were crap. You can't throw the crap out if everything is interconnected. The code that connects everything needs to be either the smallest part of the framework or part of the application itself.<p>But anyway, as long as you stay away from CMS, you're going to be fine.<p>",1195161890
80367,comment,80182,80312,0,0,donal,,,"I actually just had to write a paper on the employer spyware type software. I found an interesting article that is very applicable to this discussion:<p>Urbaczewski, A., & Jessup, L. M. (2002). Does electronic monitoring of employee internet usage work? Communications of the ACM , 80-83.<p>To summarize: Theory X management that thinks that the employee is trying to screw the company will use tracking software to enforce policy and morale and job will be low. Theory Y management will use tracking tools as metrics to identify areas of improvement and provide the data to the employee for their betterment.<p>Identifying trends in your own behavior can increase your productivity, which means that you'll take less time to complete your work. This has the potential to lower your stress and make you a happier person.<p>Just a general feeling, but I think this appeals to the Theory Y crowd.",1195161878

80363,comment,80178,80178,0,0,Tichy,,,"I feel like you - so far I have usually used frameworks, but there are always aspects that make me unhappy (not even RoR satisfied me). Now I wonder if the recent article about IDEs also applies to frameworks: if you insist on using a framework, you probably won't be able to use the latest, coolest programming languages, because there are no frameworks for them yet. <p>I am not sure how much work it is to create one's own framework, but I suspect it is less than one might think. The hardest part to me seems serious OR mapping+caching. <p>Personally, I would probably go the same route as Groovy on Grails and build on top of Spring+Hibernate (so leverage existing frameworks, but in my own style). <p>Also, I don't know any programmers who became famous for using other people's frameworks.",1195161449

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.""",1195161087

80354,comment,80178,80178,0,0,bokonist,,,"I worked on a large Python project before Django came out and ended up building my own framework.  Recently, when I used Django, I realized that almost every feature it had was something I had ended up writing myself.  Django had a lot more man hours going into the framework and was much cleaner and better tested than my implementation.<p>There are certain things you need for every project:\n  -ways to handle configuration files for different environments\n  -a pattern to map URL's to methods and templates\n  -a basic ORM so you don't have to write SQL for every single CRUD operation\n  -a test framework that simulates an actual web request\n  -a way to handle SQL migrations\n  -a way to get data to and from forms<p>Almost every production web site needs all of the above.  Why spend time doing it yourself when people have solved these problems already?  The only reason I can see for writing your own framework is as a pure learning experience.\n",1195160747

Our first laughably trivial proof of concept might be ready within six months, we're not really sure yet.

I'm not arguing you should use Lisp over Python, merely that the strength of libraries is not a language feature per se. Clearly, it's one of the most important things to consider when picking a language, but it's not a feature of that language any more than how helpful the people in that language's IRC chat room is, or how good the documentation.",1219107236

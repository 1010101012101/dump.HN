3465584,comment,3465521,3465521,6,0,brc,,,"This is funny because one of the first startup ideas I ever had was 'hey, I should make a webservices based site for collecting web payments, lots of people would use that'.  This was back when PayPal was still principally something you used to share money between two people, and was limited principally to US accounts.<p>But I made the mistake of talking over the idea with someone who I looked up to at the time, who seemed older and wiser.  They said 'there are already systems that do that, I would find something else'.<p>Now I'm not saying I had even the remotest chance of getting such a thing off the ground - but at the time, I was so ignorant that I thought I could - but the ignorance worked both ways in that I would blindly accept the word of someone else, who just highlighted the <i>schlep</i> involved and so I immediately gave up.<p>But that's just what the article says : when you're young ignorance can be a blessing, but you've got to be prepared to put in the hard work and not give up at even the tiniest hurdle.  Getting that rare mix in a young person is the elusive part.  But I'm convinced you can get young people to put in the hard work - you've just got to give them the encouragement to go ahead and fail big if need be.",1326581885

You may be an entrepreneur who then becomes a mayor, but it's not a startup unless you personally started the city. Callously throwing around the term ""startup"" does a great disservice to people who actually start companies, and historically, to those who started cities.<p>EDIT: An example of ""city as a startup"" might be what Stan Gale is doing with his ""instant city"" concept:<p>Outside Seoul in South Korea, Songdo International Business District bills itself as the world's smartest, greenest city and the most expensive privately financed real-estate project in history, with a price tag of $35 billion. It was originally commissioned by South Korea's government to be a magnet for attracting foreign direct investment. The American developer Stan Gale was hired to a build an instant city the size of downtown Boston on a man-made island connected to Seoul's airport via a 13-mile-long bridge.<p>What was imagined as a hub for Western expatriatesnot a Korean city, but a mini-Manhattan floating off the coast of South Korea, complete with a ""Central Park""has been settled instead by families from Seoul. The city won't be finished until 2015, at the earliest, but Mr. Gale is convinced that he's ""cracked the code"" of urbanism and aims to sell 20 more just like it to mayors across China. Chongqing and Changsha have already expressed an interest.<p>The aerotropolis arrives at a moment when urban centers seemingly have started to rule the world. Just 100 cities account for nearly one-third of the global economy.

Have their games gotten worse?<p>Also note that the effect on performance and throughput are cited as downsides of using GOAL.[1][2]<p>I met the Naughty Dog team back then and Crash was an awesome game.

Apparently, despite using Lisp, and learning from ""one of the best lisp programmers in the world"", none of that rubbed off on what appears to be an excellent programming team.<p>The only explanations are:<p>a) In 7+ years of working with a foremost Lisp programmer, that knowledge did not transfer, or<p>b) It did transfer, and the other programmers did not see a net advantage.<p>The OP would like us to believe that the answer is (a).

3465526,comment,3464176,3465277,2,0,Silhouette,,,"You seem to have spectacularly misunderstood my position, and even reading back over the earlier posts in this thread, I honestly can't see why. I am in favour of balance, recognising that there is a genuine problem with piracy and real economic damage being done to creative industries, but also recognising that ill-conceived legislation like SOPA is not the way to fix it. I want to see a balanced legislative approach that restores copyright to something respectable and faithful to the basic idea without the excessive protections and penalties that have been developing in various jurisdictions today. But I also have no sympathy with the ""information wants to be free crowd"", because I think they are at best economically naive and at worst selfish freeloaders. I genuinely can't understand how my comments in the grandparent post seem to have convinced you that I am some sort of evil copyright zealot.<p>To address your specific points:<p>> Please do break this down with some stats and examples.<p>OK, Open Source first:<p>Linux vs. Windows/MacOS (on the desktop)<p>OpenOffice vs. MS Office or Apple iWork<p>GIMP/Inkscape/Scribus vs. Adobe Creative Suite<p>Blender and related tools vs. Autodesk suite and related tools<p>??? vs. Exchange Server<p>??? vs. Skyrim/Battlefield 3/any other AAA game you like<p>??? vs. any serious CAD package<p>??? vs. any serious business admin suite<p>And those are all <i>big name</i> products, the kind of thing where there is critical mass for developers to build and sustain a serious OSS project, and where there are plausible alternative revenue streams available via selling support, commercial sponsorship by a company that wants to software to exist for other reasons than selling it directly, etc. Generally, OSS does best in those  sorts of areas: system/server software, programming software, geek toys, mass-market content production/consumption tools, basically anything a <i>lot</i> of geeks are going to be interested in. There are very few OSS success stories in more specialist niches or in building the kinds of professional software that keep businesses running.<p>As for self-published books, I'll give you the challenge on that one: please name <i>one</i> textbook that you would want your kids' school to use that was self-published by the author(s) without any sort of copyright-based incentive scheme but is as good or better in quality than textbooks produced following the traditional publishing route.<p>> Ah, an ad-hominem of your own, most self-righteously disguised.<p>You need to look up what <i>ad hominem</i> means. I am not attacking the creators of the work. I am attacking the quality of the work. There is no logical fallacy there.<p>> You seem to have created your own personal straw-man using the most radical contingent of anti-IP viewpoints.<p>The trouble is, they <i>aren't</i> particularly radical viewpoints among the anti-IP crowd. Read any debate on tech-heavy forums like this one or Slashdot, and you'll find plenty of people who really believe we should abolish penalties for any non-commercial copying of works under copyright. Plenty of people really do quote the ""information wants to be free"" line and use the near-zero marginal cost to justify rampant piracy while totally disregarding the fixed up-front costs of development. Plenty of people really do claim that piracy isn't costing copyright holders anything because there's no guarantee that anyone ripping a copy without paying would have paid for a legal copy anyway, a position about as plausible as the movie industry claiming that their actual losses due to infringement are greater than the global GDP. This is not some extreme caricature I've conjured up to make an argument. These are views publicly expressed by large numbers of anti-copyright advocates <i>all the time</i>. When faced with this sort of advocacy, often by people who are essentially defending breaking the law by claiming it's bad law, it's hardly surprising that politicians who aren't particularly technically literate are sceptical.<p>> Do you honestly expect many folks here to recognize only the marginal cost of content production?<p>Based on the overwhelming consensus of the comments that had been made when I wrote my first post to this thread -- not to mention the common groupthink on various other forums with an ongoing interest in this subject -- I not only expect it, I think it is pretty much proven beyond any doubt. A few more reasonable people have posted to this particular discussion since, fortunately.<p>> It seems to me that if someone wants to make money from a completely non-rivalrous and non-excludable product, the onus is very much on them to distribute their product in a commercially viable way.<p>And what way is that, exactly, if we don't enforce copyrights?<p>> Some artists are embracing the inevitable challenges of making money from information in today's market.<p>And they represent a <i>tiny</i> fraction of the content consumed today.<p>Indeed, one of the strongest arguments for the effectiveness of copyright as an economic tool and against the effectiveness of various oft-proposed alternative incentive schemes is that typically today's copyright laws don't prevent anyone from adopting one of the alternatives if it really does provide a better incentive. However, <i>almost no-one</i> has done so successfully.<p>> The large distribution cartels (e.d. RIAA) have completely rejected them, and expect governments to maintain the old business models for them using force.<p>That is how laws work. But bizarrely, a lot of people seem to think it's entirely reasonable for the law to prohibit copyright infringement, yet for the entire burden of finding infringers and bringing them to justice to fall on the copyright holder. I wonder how those people would feel if their houses were burgled and the police told them to do their own forensic work, arrest the burglers when they found them, and take them to court personally? Or, to give a more directly comparable scenario to avoid any concerns about comparing physical and intellectual property, how would those people feel if they were tricked out of a normal return on their retirement savings by professional fraudsters, and the police gave a similar response?<p>> There is indeed much room for compromise, but be not mislead about the depth of the convictions of those who disagree with you, nor of the scope of their knowledge and experience.<p>The scale of global piracy makes the convictions of those who disagree with me (or just don't care) quite clear.",1326580656

Many of my friends work in finance, which is even worse than healthcare about non-competes. In practice, without discussing any possible concrete payments that may or may not have been awarded to anyone I know, because they would be bound by confidentiality agreements that they would never violate:<p>- Companies usually only enforce it on ""key people"" but they do it liberally, as many of these companies have non-compete payout riders on their key person insurance.<p>- They may not enforce the whole term --- it is their choice.<p>- They will probably offer full salary during the non-compete period (at least in Chicago, where less than full salary won't even make it past mediation). If you lawyer up, you can probably negotiate at least COBRA/benefits payments as well and possibly part of your previous yearly bonus.<p>- If you take another job during the non-compete period, you may need to prorate the salary against what you're being paid to not work.<p>- If your friend plans to ""fight"" they should be ready for a protracted battle with many months of limbo, unpaid status during which the company will attempt to have injunctions issued against a new company to keep your friend from working. Also, many of these contracts have mandatory non-binding arbitration followed by mediation, though several lawyers I talked to said they usually just file for court anyway immediately if they're fighting, since that is where it will end up.<p>Anyway, after talking to a lawyer, if she feels like it's worth the downside risk of having to spend two years volunteering at a local animal shelter and working on her Project Euler achievements, sign away.

3465499,comment,3464607,3465281,4,0,psykotic,,,"Yeah, aside from the swap trick, there's very little to the Fisher-Yates-Knuth shuffle. It's just following the standard recursive recipe for generating permutations: to generate all permutations on n distinct elements, try every element in the first place concatenated with every permutation of the n-1 remaining elements.<p>You can implement this directly with hash sets in O(n) time, assuming you're willing to treat hash set insertion and deletion as O(1) operations:<p><pre><code>    # O(n) time\n    def shuffle(elems):\n        elems = set(elems)    # O(n) time\n        xs = []\n        while elems:\n            x = choose(elems) # O(1) time (expected)\n            xs.append(x)\n            elems.remove(x)   # O(1) time\n        return xs\n</code></pre>\nThis whole approach is obvious when you stop thinking of the problem as shuffling an array in place and start thinking of it as randomly generating a permutation of elements drawn from a set. In the final analysis, the optimized in-place implementation of the algorithm with the swap trick does provide in-place shuffling; the way the two halves of the array are used to contain respectively the partial result and an auxiliary set of remaining elements is very much like heap sort.<p>Not coincidentally, if you interpret the algorithm as I wrote it above monadically, then it can be used to generate either a random permutation or all permutations, depending on whether choose() is interpreted in the probability monad or the list (non-determinism) monad. This shows conclusively that the shuffling algorithm is really just the standard combinatorial generation algorithm for permutations adapted to random sampling. If so, you'd also expect the swap trick to be useful for generating all permutations in place.

If you're out of shape it's not fun and if you don't have the motivation to get in shape it's not going to work.  To be perfectly honest, I think that's what a good (read: effective) trainer does more than anything else - instill motivation.  There's plenty of info on how to work out, and barring that, you can quickly observe how people use the equipment and their form.  You can watch trainers instructing others.  It's really not that hard.  I started at 13 years old, years before the world wide web existed, and basically learned everything I needed from a subscription to a couple muscle mags.  Aside from that, the only people I learned from initially were other friends my age that were also beginning to work out because we certainly didn't have the $$ for trainers.  I went from 90 lbs. to 130 lbs. in that first year.  Basically I was just really sick of of being 90 lbs.  That's it.<p>I'd almost equate it with coding, expecting some hand holding will get you only so far.  The internal motivation will have to be there sooner or later or it won't stick.<p>Nowadays I don't do it nearly as much, but I can't take more than 3 or so days off because I begin to feel like crap, and I'm addicted to not feeling like crap.",1326579137

It allows me to write threaded code in a ""lazy"" way sometimes<p>As far as I understand, this is exactly the reason why the PyPy team went for the STM route: they want to guarantee the same semantics of CPython with the GIL, but with more parallelism.<p>The idea here is that most of the time threads do not conflict, which means that they do not mutate objects while other threads are accessing them. Based on this assumption, you can optimistically run a snippet of code assuming that no conflict will happen, but if there is such a conflict all the effects of the code (the ""transaction"") are rolled back and the code is run again.<p>Since the interpreter can decide where to put the transaction boundaries, it can do it where CPython would acquire/release the GIL.

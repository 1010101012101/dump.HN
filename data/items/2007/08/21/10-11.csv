44733,comment,44580,44719,0,0,jamongkad,,,"I mean really what made you say such things about PHP? not being a serious language like Perl? This is not an attack mind you, but I'm curious to know what Yahoo, Flickr, Wikipedia, and perhaps to some extent Facebook seemed to have missed when they decided to use PHP for server side stuff. What's with all the PHP hate here in YC anyways? ",1187692991

44731,comment,44580,44618,0,0,gb,,,"Javascript was the language I learnt with more or less. I think it's quite a good choice, but it is very easy to write ""bad"" Javascript, especially when it comes things like eval(). It seemed wonderful when I first discovered it, but not until some time later did I discover the kind of mess it can cause.<p>I was also introduced to OO (of sorts) through JS... I perhaps wouldn't recommend this so much, it was incredibly confusing for me at first. I didn't have any real grounding in OO principles before I started though, so perhaps that would have helped.",1187692621

There are high school kids in #haskell that know way more and probably have an easier time learning than I did.  They don't have any bad habits to unlearn.<p>Also, many ""tricky"" Haskell concepts (algebraic data types, lexical closures, first-class functions, programming without state) are actually quite logical if you've never been exposed to the C/Java way of programming.

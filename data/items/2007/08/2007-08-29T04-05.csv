One is plain looking in plain clothes that could be bought at Target (or some equivalent box store).  The other has a similar message, but is stunningly beautiful and wearing amazing designer clothes.  Do you trust one more than the other (assuming all other factors are equal)?  How many people would walk into a car dealership and approach the salesperson who was most attractive?<p>I think some ""pretty"" design smells like salesmanship to the savvy consumer, and this is reinforced by the fact that many of the most valuable sites (Craigslist, Amazon, Google, Ebay, Gmail, Del.icio.us, Reddit) aren't pretty to look at.<p>This isn't about usability and it isn't about simplicity.  It's about the spectrum of ugly ranging to beauty and whether people have a bias against pretty/slick design (I think that a lot of people do).",1188363404

47762,comment,47746,47760,0,0,rms,,,"It's an intimidating and overwhelming process. Josh (ingenium) and I went to a multi-week university seminar for faculty spinning off research into commercial ventures and the speaker on NSF grants said that it's really tough to get government grants without hiring a consultant who knows the ins and outs of the system. This will be something to do as soon as we have a spare $10,000, but we don't have any spare capital for now.<p>We also need a PhD on board... we haven't looked for a faculty sponsor because if we get someone from the University of Pittsburgh on board, Pitt owns all of our IP. Pitt has a much worse IP policy than many other large universities; PG and I had this discussion a while ago on here and he posted the link for MIT's tech transfer policy which was much more reasonable.<p>Basically, Josh and I aren't qualified to lead the research, in the eyes of the government. But Josh is pretty good at what he does and I am confident we could lead a team of Biology PhDs pretty well. They have really low salaries in Pittsburgh too, $40,000 is the starting salary for a post-doc and $100,000 and a pittance of equity would get you anyone you wanted that didn't have tenure at a university.<p>You can also only get NSF/NIH funding if it has been posted as a ""Funding opportunity"" or ""Funding notice."" They don't take unsolicited ideas; they say in advance what ideas they are funding. I hadn't looked at these for a while and I see we may have just missed one that may have been relevant. It's not exactly the idea above and I really don't know if the process is flexible enough to allow for our adult stem cell treatment. <a href=""http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-AI-07-014.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-AI-07-014.h...</a><p>It seems to me that Josh and I aren't going to be able to get government funding without handing our IP over to the University of Pittsburgh, and I have no desire to have to deal with academia. So that means we need to wait until we are independently wealthy to start researching. I also feel that we kind of have a moral prerogative to get research in this area moving forward, and I'm not sure what else we can be doing. We've casually mentioned this treatment technique to various PhDs and MDs and they unanimously say ""Yes, that could work."" However, they don't say ""That's the best idea I've ever heard and I'm going to get be your Principal Investigator for an NIH grant.""<p>Can you think of anything else we could be doing? For now, we're just bootstrapping our genetic testing company and seeing where that takes us.",1188363029

I might hold an uncommon contrarian view for news.yc but, here goes nothing:<p>""It teaches its victims to use the excreable ""viewstate"" and POST when they mean to GET and pass volumes of unnecessary and poorly-encoded data back and forth between the server and client.""<p>You are right here to the extent that ""viewstate"" is the default way of managing state, scalably, in ASP.NET. And this adds to the amount of data being streamed between the server and the client, and back. But, when performance is the ""key"" consideration, you can turn off viewstate for controls that dont rely on it, or for the page as a whole. If you are really hard-core about performance, you can write HTTP handlers that override parts or whole of the default handlers. Thus, you can maintain state on the server side completely if you wish to (dealing also with the concomitant issues to scale the site).<p>"".Net programmers learn to drag and drop things onto forms which Visual Studio then clogs up with layers of absolute-positioning tags, ensuring that the resulting pages will only display correctly on certain browsers with certain window-sizes and absolutely will not print properly, even when the planets are properly aligned.""<p>If you look into the ""flow"" layout mode, you will see that ""absolute-positioning"" is only one of the options that the Visual Studio Designer presents to you. There are no browser compatibility issues per se with the ""flow"" layout mode for printing or otherwise. <p>Also, Drag and Drop is a _Good Thing_. I have been dabbling with RoR lately and am yet to find good tooling around it. But, Visual Studio .NET is definitely one of the most powerful IDEs I have worked in. Drag and Drop = Increase in productivity.<p>""But that's okay, with .Net you can use Reporting Services to design hundreds of divergent 'reports.'""<p>From what you say in your comment, you seem to have quite a bit of experience with developing web applications for businesses. Given that, I am quite surprised you havent encountered similar attitudes that I have, as far as ""Reports"" go. Business Users _LOVE_ reports. ""Reports"" have been given a substantial amount of attention in most projects I have been associated with. So they are not ""divergent"" by any means. Drag Drop Capability for Designing of Reports, with Design Time handles for all the entities that compose it, is again very powerful for a host of business scenarios.<p>"".Net teaches programmers to code to Microsoft's api, not to web standards, fundamental principles of math and computer science or, frequently, to common sense.""<p>""It isn't to Microsoft's advantage for developers to consider other options and thus they try with great success to prevent .Net developers from realizing those options even exist. Microsoft documentation almost never refers to RFCs, even when doing so would be helpful. They hide the browser object model as much as they can and instead present the .Net wrapper for the browser object model as the only truth, with a Microsoft registered-trademark character after every thought.""<p>Tnese are very strong statements. :) I actually think that the Server Side abstraction that ASP.NET provides to developers is amazing. Why? Because being exposed to the ""browser object model"" for a number of browsers and their varying capabilities is not really meaningful when what I want to do is develop relativly straight-forward applications _fast_. You can also look into what ASP.NET calls ""Adaptive Rendering"". This also serves to abstract away the nitty-gritties of the browser making the HTTP requests.<p>""As you may guess, it results from great frustration with well-funded idiocy in the wasteland of corporate American IT. Also I just tried to pay my property taxes online and the lovely .aspx page blew up with a CLIENT-SIDE VBSCRIPT error.""<p>Sure there are idiots in IT. And sure there are idiotic ways to develop software. Microsoft's marketing department does a good job capturing market share in the corporate world. Once they do that enough, it moves into the realm of supply and demand. When we have enough money to pay, enough unqualified people move into all points in the software development cycle, and what we get is this.",1188362296

Probably $2.5-$10k for someone really good.<p>We expect to spend about $15-$20k, to start, and I'll be doing all of the heavy lifting of hooking things up--we just want to get HTML/CSS mockups done, with no actual work on integrating the style into our application or website.  But we have a lot of stuff in our app.  Heavy use of forms, vast swaths of information spread across hundreds of pages, etc.  But then again, the pool of talent that we're wanting to work with is pretty much limited ""famously good"".  If we're going to pay for it, we figure it might as well be as good as we can get.  I've gotten much better over the past two years, as I've focused more on design and less on software development...so if we're going to pay rather than just let me tinker with it more, it's gotta be great.",1188361177

47751,comment,47746,47746,0,0,rms,,,"It is incorrect to say that the CCR5 delta32 mutation came exclusively from the plague. It is more likely that it came from smallpox.<p>The title of this article is even worse, ~10% of people of European descent are resistant to HIV and 10% of those individuals are practically immune to HIV. The mutation is more common in people of northern European descent and some eastern European ethnic groups, like Ashkenazi Jews.<p>This summary of a paper published in  <i>Nature</i>  shows that mice with the CCR5 delta32 mutation still get the plague. <a href=""http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=22189"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_...</a> Subscription/university tunnel required for the real paper.<p>This is another study concluding that smallpox was the more likely selecting factor for the mutation.

Introduce the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene and grow the cells in culture. These can then be ""transplanted"" back into the patient. These transplanted stem cells will create HIV immune T cells. Once there are enough immune T cells, the patient will probably still have HIV, but it will not develop into AIDS. There will be no chance of rejection since they are the patient's own cells. Furthermore, since the body does produce antibodies to HIV, these modified T cells may even be able to fight off the HIV.<p>To test this, we would get a mouse line, which are genetically very similar to each other from inbreeding so we won't have to worry about rejection of the transplants, and introduce the human CCR5 receptor into them. This, in theory, will allow the mice to be infected with HIV since HIV attaches to the CCR 5 receptor to enter and infect the cell. If this works, we can then try the technique of taking some of their stem cells, introducing the mutation, transplanting them back in, and see if their T cell count increases or if the levels of HIV decrease. It could also be used as a preventative therapy, which we can also easily test on the mice.<p>(HIV curing idea is courtesy of my partner, his username is ingenium on here.

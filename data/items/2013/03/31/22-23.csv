Can you imagine starting a business and then beseeching the SEC king David Blass to find out if your business is legal, and announcing with relief a ""no action"" letter? It cost Angellist and FundersClub a few tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees simply to find out what the ever-shifting law was. Worse, to be a CEO of a startup these days you need to be willing to risk jail time to launch a new product. For had Blass (unelected and likely unfirable due to ""career status"") ruled the other way, many would consider that a judgment on the legitimacy of the transactions at issue <i>rather than</i> a demonstration of the illegitimacy of the SEC. And FC/Angellist would have had to scramble away post-haste from crowdfunding for fear that disintermediating Blass' banksters meant being fitted for pinstripes.<p>Go back and read the original TechCrunch article. People actually thought FundersClub might be facing jail time! What brass, what courage you need to start a business today in a regulated space. They took maximum risks, I wish them (and Angellist) maximum reward.

The traditional solution for this is to have each university course specify its prerequisite courses, and for students to talk to the professor before the class starts if they're not sure it's appropriate. The latter happened to my friends and I much more during freshman year, when we weren't sure how our high school classes would prepare us, though it didn't always work perfectly - I knew lots of people who re-took calculus or a low-level foreign language class after having had it in high school, and found it way too easy.<p>Maybe in 5 or 10 years there will be enough online courses available that it would be clear that the Duke physiology class is harder, and some other class would be a good prerequisite to it.

This should mean that the API is helping to ensure the client never sends the user down a UX dead-end, and also that the client does not break when the API changes.<p>But...<p>2) I don't like the thought of collections having a resource identifier for a page. As items are deleted from the collection, the resource identifiers now represent a modified resource and break caching (delete item 3 of a 5 item per page collection, and all resources in the collection - logical pages - have been modified implicitly).<p>I much prefer using query string for this, as it is a query on a collection.<p>But... the API should still be the thing that generates/builds these URLs, the client should never do this work. The client must use the provided first|prev|self|next|last URLs, otherwise the client may break in the future.<p>An example of how I prefer pagination:<p><pre><code>    ""collectionName"": {\n      ""total"": 861,\n      ""limit"": 10,\n      ""offset"": 100,\n      ""pages"": 87,\n      ""links"": [\n        {""rel"": ""first"", ""href"": ""/api/things?limit=10""},\n        {""rel"": ""prev"", ""href"": ""/api/things?limit=10&offset=90""},\n        {""rel"": ""self"", ""href"": ""/api/things?limit=10&offset=100""},\n        {""rel"": ""next"", ""href"": ""/api/things?limit=10&offset=110""},\n        {""rel"": ""last"", ""href"": ""/api/things?limit=10&offset=860""},\n      ],\n      ""items"": [\n        ...\n      ]\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhere 'limit' and 'offset' are provided by the query string (but default to 25 and 0 respectively) and the API takes care of generating valid links (like not including 'prev' if you are on the first page').<p>This way the client does what it should, just use the links provided.<p>And whilst I'm here... one of the things I dislike about link relations is how they presently fail to mention the method you should use (let alone content-types acceptable by that end-point).<p>In the example above every link is a GET, in the example on this page <a href=""http://restcookbook.com/Basics/hateoas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://restcookbook.com/Basics/hateoas/</a> they're probably POST. In the link relation assignments <a href=""http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relation...</a> 'edit' is probably a PUT. There's an 'edit', but not a 'delete', so it's not as if just sending more than one 'rel' might describe the method.<p>Today the audience of an API is a developer, so it's fine to just point them at the documentation.

I've also got a Github page at www.snebu.com (this is mostly the Github auto generated web page based on the readme, with a Google Analytics stub in it so I can see if anyone is downloading it).<p>Just to give a bit more information, I started off with using the rsync/snapshot method (rsync to a remote drive, then cp -al to create hard links into a snapshot directory).  But I didn't like that the clients needed to have root access to the backup server (yes I could resolve most of that through fancy ssh authorized_keys file scripting).  Also I needed compression (was using ZFS with compression originally).  So I designed ""snebu"" (simple network backup utility) to store compressed files on the backup server similar to how Git stores objects (using the sha1 checksum to name the files), and I keep all the metadata in an Sqlite database.  That way, I have the simplicity of something like rsync, but with some of the features of the heavy-weight backup programs (like Bacula, Amanda, etc) but with a slightly easier setup.<p>I'm in the middle of re-writing the documentation, so I'm sort of looking for feedback on if the current docs don't quite explain things good enough.<p>Thanks.",1364768501

I live in a town (Ermesinde) that in 15 years went from less than 10,000 people to slightly less than 100,000. The only planning was: build as much as you can, even illegally. About 15% of the new buildings around 2000 were actually against the law (not following proper distance from others among other zoning problems) and were mostly approved based on kickbacks to gov officials. My parents were asked for these 'gloves' from officials when rebuilding some of their old apartments, and my own house wasn't licensed correctly to live on (I bought it used, previous owner/builder didn't obtain the licensing, had to do a lot of construction to get it to code. Talked with the lawyer, he saw the name of the person that signed the papers, said it was common for his work to be illegal as long as he was paid under the table)",1364767710

However, I assumed that such things were asking too much of poor schools and that, really, the HN readers who dug through K&R, etc. on their own with no marketing, design, encouraging e-mails, etc. didn't really need such nice hand holding.<p>But I will say, at some crucial points for me, some teachers did play a crucial role:  The college I graduated from then had a quite good math department, and some of the teaching aimed at me personally in some of the courses was just excellent and got me going so that I could continue on to 'the next level' in math via independent work.  Then for on-line learning, as progress is made on the first, and easiest work, many of the students will need some 'personalized TLC' or risk getting off track, slowing down, and stopping.<p>Part of such TLC will be overviews:  That is, it needs to be more clear to students what the value, purpose, or promise is of various parts of the course.<p>Another part of TLC is that students need to write some things, e.g., homework exercises, term papers, something like lab reports, and have their work read by an expert and 'corrected'.  E.g., a place to learn nicely polished skills in writing about functions, maps, mappings, relations, etc. is in a theorem proving course in abstract algebra where a good professor actually corrects some student homework.  Then when work with functions, maps, ..., in computing, will get the notation and terminology right; without such TLC, often won't get those things right.  E.g., earlier today I read a little about hashing passwords, and the material mentioned a function ""between the hashes and\npasswords"".  No, ""between"" is not appropriate.  The usual description, and appropriate, is a function f from the set of hashes to the set of passwords.  To be clear and not just picky, function f may not define a function g from the set of passwords to the set of hashes because there may be a password p such that there is no hash h so that f(h) = p.  That is, the function f may not be 'onto', i.e., 'surjective' as at<p><pre><code>     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function\n</code></pre>\nThe level of clarity and precision available, useful, and often important is high, but students commonly need some in-person, TLC teaching in such things.<p>There's an old lesson in 'education':  Get the student able to continue on in learning on their own.  For that, usually some 'personalized TLC' is needed at a few crucial points in a student's development.  To be really successful, the on-line approach will have to include some of that TLC also.",1364767241

337743,comment,337628,337628,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I love reading commentaries. As a result of that love, I've come to spot populist messages. To me, a populist message is one in which most all of the listeners are going to feel like ""heck yes!"" while they are reading it.<p>Populist messages have a tendency, however, to fall apart upon further inspection. There is no doubt that people hate performance reviews -- managers and employees alike. There's no doubt that in most cases they cause and create behavior that nobody wants.<p>I think he misses the boat right off the bat with the purpose of the review. The purpose of the review is to make sure the <i>manager</i> is doing his job with the employee, knowing what's going on in the employee's work, having an interest, offering to help, seeing where the employee and the company's interests can be aligned. Some of these conversations are tough, and if you didn't require them, a lot of employees would never have the chance to say no, I don't want to be a tech lead, I'd rather get into teaching (or something similar). To view the review process as primarily raise and checklist based is to see how it's done instead of seeing what it's supposed to do. A common argument in populist writing is to say ""since X is commonly done very poorly, X is therefore a bad idea altogether""<p>He gets even further into the cool-aid with this comment ""I'm sick and tired of hearing about subordinates who fail and get fired, while bosses, whose job it was to ensure subordinate effectiveness, get promoted and receive raises in pay.""<p>Sounds good -- as long as you think bosses should always be able to make/help subordinates be happy and productive. But while managers are definitely super people, they're not super<i>man</i>. Things happen in life. People get accepted at jobs they will never like. Companies take directions employees simply can't agree with. There are lots of reasons why somebody can get fired while management is not responsible. I'm not even sure that <i>most</i> times management is responsible, but I know that it's not all of the time. Generalizations are always false: including this one.<p></Rant>",1224499259

But I got sent to a new customer that didn't like my face and asked for a replacement after a week.<p>My boss was asked to burn the review. Someone else from above would write a new one. I guessed what was going on (later my boss confirmed my guesses), so I didn't waste a second. A week later I gave the two weeks notice to go to a place with 20% more pay.

I works ok- occasional hiccups, but with calendar integration becoming more important to me I went with it.  The Cal syncs to google and my own caldav.  T-bird had to come off of the special builds for a 64-bit box, and getting Cal to work was a pain.<p>Since I keep the email on a separate workspace (and Evolution doesn't have taskbar notification by default-which is a win for me) I only check it periodically throughout the day.  The major pain-point is that it will ""forget"" the logins of my accounts if I leave it open all day.  With my workflow I can just close it if I get annoyed.<p>Thunderbird handles filters better, in my view.  Unless I'm missing something, with Evolution I have to add every single person into a ""rule"" to sort incoming mails into folders.  With Tbird I can say ""If member of this list-> go here.""  Very nice and useful to me as I manage a community service organization with over 100 members.

2186281,comment,2185174,2186191,0,0,Alex3917,,,"So I think there are three different metrics to look at:<p>1) How physically addictive a drug is. E.g. withdrawals from oxycontin are much worse than withdrawals from cocaine.<p>2) How 'moreish' the drug is. In other words, how compulsively do users redose. With salvia most people smoke it once and then don't want to do it again for at least a few years if ever, whereas with mephedrone people snort it and then they NEED to keep snorting it ever fifteen minutes or so until they run out.<p>3) The percentage of people that use a given drug who become addicted. You would expect this to vary wildly depending on factors one and two, but it's actually virtually a constant.[1] Pretty much 10% of people who try a drug will get addicted whether it's alcohol, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, etc. There is a little variation of course, but not nearly as much as you'd expect if addiction were driven mainly by the properties of the drug itself.<p>[1] Once you cancel out the differences due to the routes of administration, i.e. smoking a drug is vastly more addictive than eating it regardless of what the substance.",1297021523

2186278,comment,2185429,2186208,0,0,esoteriq,,,"Sure - no problem. Just to give you some context, I got my implant in 1991, and technology has advanced by leaps and bounds since then.<p>Cochlear implants are quite different than hearing aids. Hearing aids just amplify sounds. Cochlear implants actually directly stimulates your auditory nerve via a surgical implant, mimicking sound. Normally, sound waves pass through your cochlea and stimulate the multiple hair cells, triggering different ""sounds"" (as interpreted by your brain). Since the cochlear implant stimulates the auditory nerve more directly, once a person is implanted, the person loses all of his or her residuary hearing. Obviously, only people with profound or severe hearing losses are allowed to get a cochlear implant.<p>My cochlear implant has two components - the inner and external portions. The external portion is the speech processor and it looks somewhat like a hearing aid without the ear mold and it has a magnetic part that attaches to your head. The speech processor converts sounds into electrical signals that goes through a magnet that is attached to my head. The electrical signal will pass through the internal parts of my cochlear implant (the implants itself) and stimulate the nerve, causing me to hear sound. I should add that the conversion process filters out most background noises and focuses on frequencies used for speech. As a result, I can't really appreciate music because with the limited frequency range of the cochlear implant, music sounds all muddled to me.<p>Of course, that's the technical part. I can hear, but I can't hear anywhere as well as a hearing person. I still have a lot of difficulties hearing in a noisy situation, such as restaurants, bars, etc. I can't really differentiate between certain sounds such as b/ps, g/hs and the like.<p>I can, however, converse with most people. I have an ""accent"" because I learned how to speak relatively late - 8 years old. I have met people who got their implants when they were two or three and they barely have an accent.<p>One thing I should also add - most people who receive a cochlear implant need special training to use it. Since I was one of the first 500 children to receive a cochlear implant after the FDA approved it for children, I underwent intensive speech-and-listening training. I had to learn how to listen since I had no frame of reference for sound. I'm sure you can imagine how hard it is to get a six-year old to sit still and practice listening for hours at a time. It took me two years before I could start learning how to speak. I didn't feel comfortable speaking in public until I was thirteen or so.<p>Of course, the process is quite different for someone who heard before they got an implant because he or she has a frame of reference. After talking to younger implant recipients, I get the impression that the technology and training methods have improved, so the whole process isn't as onerous anymore.<p>Hopefully this wasn't too much information and if I misstated something (probably biology-related) I apologize in advance! If you have more questions, feel free to ask!",1297021386

In fact, I was a very early adopter.  I’d say I was in the beta, but hey, so was everyone!  Seriously though, I was pretty early.  It seemed like the thing to do.  I had been hosting my own mail forever and had a server die (the real death) and was tired of fighting spam.  It was a free, seemingly reliable alternative.<p>Over the last few years I’ve become increasingly frustrated.  As a free solution I had no support, so when my wife’s emails were going missing I had no help in chasing it down.  I never did solve it.  I had mails forwarded to me that were indeed sent, but alas, they never showed in her inbox.  That’s probably when I found that there were two inboxes – the real one accessible from POP/IMAP and the web interface.  Last year I seriously played with using a local client (on Linux) for at least my mail.  It was a baby step to the real leap I wanted to make, which was to get off GMail altogether.  But none of the Linux clients were really to my liking; they all had some warts that were just too ugly for me to cutover.  This last week my wife started having problems accessing a web site that happens to be hosted on Google sites.  It was a really strange permissions problem, apparently because logging on to get herlein.com email set a certain user permission in the new Google App infrastructure.  I spent 15 minutes chasing that before realizing that I really want no part of it.<p>I’ve been able to ignore the privacy implications of using Google for a long time.  However, lately I’ve had a growing sense of unease.  After all, NOTHING IS FREE.    I was getting email services but was paying in units of privacy… and we don’t yet know the conversion rates for that currency!  As I scraped through the new Google App infrastructure I realized that Google’s email is really complicated – it’s not just a simple email interface anymore.  They are bolting on a ton of things underneath that we don’t know much about.  Hell, they may not know much about them either, to be fair.  Does the right hand know what the left is doing over there?  Even if they do, am I comfortable with that much more of my data and traffic crossing that system?<p>You see, Google is an advertising company cloaked as a technology company.  I work in advertising and I joke that part of my job is trying to make Minority Report style ads really viable.  But Google is DOING THAT NOW, just without the silly retina flashes, and not in ways we can even imagine now.   Over the last few years they ‘index’ all my email, measure my click throughs, and with the Google Apps infrastructure can see a lot deeper into my traffic and inner workings (assuming I host docs there, etc).  To what gain?  Ads.  Better and more specific relevant targeted ads.  Good for them, they are building a business.  I won’t address any moral issues around all this.  For now, it’s legal, they got there first and so far they are executing on it.  Nice.   And supposedly they provide an opt out.  But their system is so darn complicated under the hood, will it really work?<p>Except that I don’t have to play.  Or at least, I can choose to not accept services in exchange for aspects of my privacy that I cannot measure (yet).  I can move my email to another provider, for starts.<p>So I did.  I turned on a Rackspace email account and pointed my MX records there.  Unfortunately I didn’t realize that GoDaddy DNS sets the timeouts to 1 week by default for MX records, so I’m keeping Google set at a lower priority and keeping it active for a week, just to be sure I don’t drop an email (as a side note, I’ll be moving my DNS off GoDaddy soon too – I simply hate their GUI).  I don’t really care for the RackSpace web interface for mail, but it’s functional.  That’s my backup really anyway, since I do most of my mail on my mobile, or from my desktop.  And now that I have cut over to all Mac’s at home I just use the Apple Mail program.  It has warts too, but it’s functional, and I love how well spotlight finds stuff on my hard drive.  I don’t need Google to search mail!  Really!  That technology is so commonplace now.  That value add is commodity!  Rackspace has a special deal for SliceHost customers (I host this blog on SliceHost) so my email will cost me $36 per year.  I suspect that my privacy is worth a lot more than $36 per year!<p>My only remaining question is:  why didn’t I do this sooner?",1297019652

I clicked 'Help a fellow hacker' thinking it would lead to a page about that process, or with a list of people needing my skill set, but now it sounds like I might be contacted by someone who took the time to write me a personalized request that I'm not (yet) ready for.<p>I just signed up to get a feel for the site for now.<p>I also recommend skill set options in product management, project management and community relations.",1297019136

I thought that it would probably follow an r^3 function but it appears that it follows something closer to an r^2 function - perhaps that is explained by the flatness of the galaxy or just noise? For example, within 20 light years there are only 77.<p>Stars by Distance:\n<a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3924269/plot_10956.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3924269/plot_10956.jpg</a><p>NStED:\n<a href=""http://nsted.ipac.caltech.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nsted.ipac.caltech.edu/</a>",1297019031

(In my case, this is often in the form of an impending deadline.)<p>Other than school, however, I have been working with a friend, attempting to launch my first startup. This is an incredibly high-value task for me, which leads to greater motivation despite a lack of solid deadlines. In this case, I procrastinate very little.<p>That's not, of course, to say that every task related to launching is high-value. In those instances, you are correct, aggressive goal-setting is absolutely necessary. I'd add, though, that it's not simply an attempt to ""keep this sort of thing up,"" but rather a simple acknowledgement of how I function.",1297018816

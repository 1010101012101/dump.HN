8187708,comment,8187106,8187623,5,0,mackwic,,,"Having done a (simple, but non-trivial) memcached implementation in Rust, the pointer semantic is terrible right now.\nThe compiler tracks all the use of the values and assign them lifetimes. These lifetimes are tagged from a special form of use (value, mutable value, reference, mutable reference, and some more).<p>The idea of Rust memory-safety is to totally forbid two simultaneous mutable lifetime whatever the code path could be.<p>Whatever the code path could be. Do you begin to realize how strong this assumption is ?<p>Yes, the rust compiler is smart. But sometimes, it&#x27;s not enough and you have to do the lifetime tracking job by yourself. It&#x27;s awfully hard (even without recursion).  \nBut you know what&#x27;s even harder ? When <i>all</i> the common code patterns you are aware of for a given task doesn&#x27;t provide enough warranty for the rust compiler. You know what you want to do. It&#x27;s indeed very simple (can be an inner swap in some sort of algorithm) but you can&#x27;t find a way to warranty the compiler that all should be good. Because in its own sort of bizarre logic, it makes sense. Then you&#x27;re trapped. And you are waiting on #rust@irc.mozilla.org an hint from the bunch of truly marvelous guys who pass their time here.<p>TLDR: Rust can&#x27;t express 100% what others languages do (ML or C based). And in the portion where it can, you have to do a lot of gymnastic to make it compile.<p>And our Memcached, you&#x27;ll ask ? Well. After 6 days of work, we finally make it compile, and it worked quite fine. But then we got some mysterious tasking errors when reaching 20 clients and gave up at this point.",1408226297

Though it seems rather innocuous, but as a daily &quot;lugger&quot; with 2 other older bodies, it basically said &quot;Goodbye, we don&#x27;t care about your type any longer.&quot;<p>That they couldn&#x27;t really keep up with the immense digital R&D budgets of more mainstream camera companies was not entirely surprising, and I accepted long ago that a Leica purchase would consist of high cost, and performance (though not <i>necessarily</i> image quality) that equals a generation or two back as compared to Canon/Nikon.<p>That said, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this camera was immensely successful for them. The avant-garde design (as compared to the current retro-schtick) has cachet, <2K is a more reasonable price-point than the M models, it apparently performs adequately, and a new lens mount gives it plenty of &quot;retail therapy&quot; potential. This really is a page out of the Apple playbook.<p>Leica has been, for many years, not a single monolithic philosophy as manifested in equipment, but a company navigating a rapidly changing market. For a time they found a sizable market that echoed my wants, but no longer. Such is life, and Leica is not alone.

You merely have to meet some fairly basic requirements before you carry passengers for hire to ensure a basic level of competence.<p>The law is not a computer program.

I did a crash course in New York by living in 8 different places (7 CL, 1 GF) in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn in the nearly 3 years I&#x27;ve lived here. Easy to find furnished places, but they go fast and it will be harder to score a place without a face-to-face meet with the renter.<p>Manhattan, even Alphabet City, is best if you&#x27;re an extrovert, like to be able to step out at 3am into a city that still acts like it&#x27;s 8pm, and like high energy in general. But rents are expensive. If you find something cheap it will be dark, cramped, rough, or all three.<p>Queens is cheapest. Astoria is nice, and is a quick, above ground (always better) subway ride away from Manhattan. In fact, look at subway time to where you want to go frequently rather than distance.<p>Brooklyn is either old school or hip depending on which parts.

What i&#x27;m doing is:<p>- Learning linux\n     ...because every other language I want to learn is not on the .NET stack, and pretty much every interesting job requires linux knowledge.<p>- Learning other languages\n     I have a todo list of languages I want to try. There are a few I know I will want to go deeper into, which include Scala and Clojure, but for now I have a list of every popular (non-C#) language that i want at least minimal exposure to.<p>My todo list consists of concrete tasks like &quot;Ruby hello world&quot;, &quot;Scala hello world&quot;, &quot;Angular hello world&quot;. Just knock these things out and then once I have basic exposure to a broad array of languages and tech stacks, I&#x27;ll decide which I want to focus on, and start adding more concrete tasks to my todo list. This might include contriving a side project that is simple, but more involved than a simple hello world, and then building it out in one or two or three of the languages/stacks. At this point you&#x27;ll have to start thinking about what direction you want to go, what kind of development you want to focus on. You might want to freelance as a Wordpress or Drupal dev, so you might decide to dive into PHP, or you might want to specialize in distributed systems, so you might focus your experimentations/hello worlds on more back end type stuff.<p>- Getting better at front-end development. \n     This is the area people like you and me can use as a bridge to transitioning over to non-.NET tech. Assuming you are working in web apps with .NET, you can start to focus on the front end, which means getting really good at HTML, CSS, and javascript, and learning front-end frameworks like bootstrap/foundation, SASS/LESS, and angular/ember. You can do that while still doing .NET on the server side.  You can also start working in front end build technologies like grunt or gulp into existing or new .NET projects, to handle front end optimizations, and bundling/minification, image optimizations, etc. This also builds your javascript knowledge, and knowing angular seems like a really marketable skill these days. This in combo with learning linux is enough to get you to a point where you are able to get front-end dev jobs that have nothing at all to do with .NET.<p>My two cents. I&#x27;d be really interested to hear from other developers who have successfully made this kind of transition. I have no idea if what I&#x27;m planning will actually work.",1408224422

No app that isn&#x27;t vim or isn&#x27;t trying to partially resemble vim has used that obsolete &quot;uh, down means up, so left means down&quot; hjkl arrowkey arrangement for decades. Everyone else, all apps, spreadsheets, games, other text editors, including all standard hardware, uses an inverted-T arrangement for arrowkeys.<p>So, no problem, vim lets you remap your keys, which takes care of the problem. Many of us remap the &quot;arrowkeys on the home row&quot; to the standard inverted-T of ijkl (and remap i, for insert left, to h, reach left instead of reaching up), so that both sets of arrowkeys on the keyboard match each other and match their arrangement in every other app we use. Those with other keyboards, such as Dvorak, will often map to different keys that make more sense on their own keyboards. The ability to do so has always been one of the features of &quot;real vi(m)&quot;.<p>I hope that for your file browser, you&#x27;ll pass the keypresses through the (g)vimrc map, so that whatever keys a user has chosen for up, down, left, right, escape, and whatever else the file browser handles, will work the same way in both the editor and the file browser, which is to say, the way their &quot;real vim&quot; works.",1408224287

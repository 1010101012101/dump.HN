71549,comment,71371,71371,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Wow. That certainly got a lot of responses.<p>\nMy .02, for what it's worth. Everything we consume changes the way our bodies and minds work. Some things do it a lot and some are more subtle. I think rms belongs on YC because a) he's got a web-based business, and b) because he's interested in hacking his own body. Additionally, I wouldn't have a problem with somebody selling Ginkoba, herbal tea, meditation beads, self-hypnosis tools, etc.<p>\nHaving said that, it sounds very unpopular with some people. It brings up a whole political argument that's probably out of bounds for this site. It seems like it hacks your mind and body a bit more than herbal tea. And in the bigger picture of ""should we tolerate people pitching us drugs"" I'd have to agree that it's out of place. So it's probably one of those things, like extreme flatulence, that's best kept as quiet and far away as possible. There's a whole other discussion about the ethics of selling the stuff which I won't go into. An interesting moral question is: if you could take substances that would make you great at business and able to retire in five years, yet left you a quaking, mixed-up junkie, would it be worth it? That's a rhetorical question!<p>\nI do find ironic is that somebody who is taking a form of stimulent can be so hyper and promotive of their product without realizing they sound like a habitual drug user recommending it to others. I have a soft spot for such pitches -- I know I've been in several business opportunities where I desperately wanted people to realize how much my product could help them, yet if you're ticking people off, it's probably time to tone it down a bit. It's going to be really hard to have a business in which you actively offend 15% (offend as in the villagers have torches and are storming the castle) with your marketing. Go for a venue and a message delivery mechanism that doesn't include those folks.",1193136748
71548,comment,71371,71371,0,0,Andys,,,"RMS, I think you will fail for the following reasons:<p>1. Being based closely on a plant is not good enough: even if you patent the release formulation, it is too easy for someone to copy.  This means you'll never be able to sell it for enough money, to make it worthwhile doing the unbelievably huge investment in clinical trials and FDA bribe money needed to get it permitted.<p>2. There's too much vested interest in the regulated market of patentable drugs for them to stand by while you sell a pill that is equally (in some cases more) effective but based on a plant.  Anything that grows on trees is quickly smeared and banned on the thinnest shreds of evidence.<p>Having said all that, I have no problem with your product being sold as incense to whoever wants to consume it.  But you'll remain a cottage industry for the foreseeable future.",1193135412

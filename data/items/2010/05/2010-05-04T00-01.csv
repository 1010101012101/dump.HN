Online games that use a combination of these techniques. Apps that grab video from your webcam and <i>do</i> something with it. (Mozilla demonstrated that: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/02/mozilla-demos-impressive-firefox-31-features-at-scale.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/02/mozilla-demo...</a> ) The dream of doing distributed computing by just visiting a web page could come true (like for X@Home). An OS in your browser would become not-a-joke. Native VNC instead of flash. Native encryption run by the app instead of the browser, possibly permitting ssh-in-the-browser. Actual typesetting could be implemented (surprisingly computationally expensive) allowing actual competition in the Office space.<p>You rather proved my point, unfortunately. Web apps are <i>not</i> about ""DOM manipulation"". They are about delivering no-install applications over the internet. They <i>have historically been</i> about DOM manipulation because that was all they could afford to do performantly (and that only barely at times). As that changes, so does the web.

To be fair maybe the Ubuntu folks have a perfect design for this, but since they havent released it its hard to be optimistic.

As we all know, it didn't work out so well.<p>I hear that a lot, but I think Java applets didn't gain widespread traction more because of the arrival of Flash as an easier format for simple animations and interactions than anything else.<p>Java applets remain a useful tool for browser-based UIs today; one of my current projects involves writing one. The biggest technical hurdle is that not everyone installs a modern JRE with their browser any more, which is a downer for casual use because it means there's stuff to install locally. For tools you're going to use every day it's no big hurdle, though.<p>The primary alternatives are Flash (which is well-established but looking more awkward and proprietary with all the current politics, and somewhat limited in its applicability) and JavaScript (which has potential, but isn't even close to being a good language for developing serious UIs of moderate or large size today, and no amount of HTML5 canvas/multimedia hype is going to change that).",1272932385

Requirements on the end product are to be expected, requirements on the specific tooling used to create the product are more unusual and potentially represent anti-competitive activity.<p>With respect to game consoles, Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo have their own acceptance processes, but they do not require you use a particular compiler or code in a particular language, all they care about is the end product. A lot of the multi-platform games these days are developed using tool-chains specially built for the purpose, so that, for example, the PS3 release and the 360 release are just different builds from the same code base rather than awkwardly separate development efforts as they would be otherwise. Such tools vastly ease the burden of releasing to multiple consoles and in many cases enable developers to do multi-platform releases that they would otherwise not have the resources to do.<p>Apple's licensing restrictions make this sort of thing impossible. You can't reasonably build a tool-chain to target, say, both iPhone and android development from the same code base.

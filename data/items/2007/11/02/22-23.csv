That's what computers do, that's what you do when you do a sum by yourself, and that's what such a neural network should do too. (You should encode the symbols to a binary input, then decode the neural network output to symbols).",1194044164

Sure, the food is great and you have everything you need but I think it's counter productive to starting a startup. You need to dislike your current job enough to want to do something else.<p>I also agree with the author that humility is a scarce resource at Google.",1194043487

Media Center is actually a great system, especially compared to the crap dvr you get with comcast or fios.  The Apple TV doesn't compare.  It would have been a great opportunity for Apple to dominate in a segment where most agree Microsoft stands out but they didn't take advantage of it.<p>Other than that, I completely agree that overall, apple has a better user experience than MS.",1194042482

It seems to me that the YouPorn folks are at far higher risk of being sued out of existence...yes, all of the traditional pay-for-content sites, and buy-our-DVDs companies, are in serious trouble, because of sites like YouPorn.  But, taking YouPorn out of the picture through acquisition wouldn't solve that problem--though I guess I can begin to see the extortion angle if we follow that through to one possible conclusion: Every 20-something nerd in the world will suddenly think, ""Hey, I can build a killer porn video site, and some poor schmucks at a billion dollar porn company will have to buy it to prevent competition!""<p>Hard to say how the targeted buyers view things.  But they're (currently) in the position of power.  They have hundreds of millions in revenues, versus a few million for YouPorn.  And, now that YouPorn is known to have revenue, and has forced itself onto the radar of lots of people, it's going to attract lawsuits...",1194041847

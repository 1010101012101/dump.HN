1714254,comment,1712493,1713739,0,0,ebiester,,,"Oy, all I can say is that grinding poverty changes your mental state. I've seen both sides: my father grew up middle class and my mother grew up poor. My grandparents were the ""frugal poor"" that you think about -- my grandfather ended up having a heart attack in his 30s and never quite recovered. The difference is that both of them were intelligent, in spite of not having a high school education, and they lived in an era where you could get a job in that environment. (My grandfather grew up in a farming community where people were taken out of school after the 4th grade to work the fields.)<p>But not everyone is lucky like that. Poor people often grow up malnourished, and their IQ suffers. Everyone here is blessed with above average intelligence, but many don't have the educational foundation to develop the skills to make the right choices, and we don't exactly have frugality shows on TV to explain how to be an informed consumer.<p>Being poor is having the nearest grocery store a 30 minute bus ride and walk away from you and your kid. <a href=""http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/news/grocery_gap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/news/grocery_gap.html</a><p>The thing is, everyone agrees that poor people should do all those things. But, like most things in life, the reality is harder than the ideal. My grandparents were able to do it.<p>In IT, we talk about stupid users. Many of the people we complain about are IQ 100, and many of the poor we're talking about are as close to them in intelligence as the average IT worker to the clueless worker.<p>How do you teach an 80 IQ mother the skills necessary? (Remember, the malnourishment throughout her own childhood, combined with the poor decisions of her parents, contributed to this problem - it's environmental, not genetic.)<p>That's the rationale behind spending money on WIC programs - if you can get the children proper nourishment, they can be attentive enough in their education that they can escape the problem.",1285106376

Then at the party it is clear they are out of their depth, they are too shy or too aggressive, or both, with some odd mix of insecurity and uncertainty over how to behave. And then you wish you hadn't invited them to the party.<p>That is my perception of Ben and Mena Trott, in so far as their personas on the web go (which is the only way that I, and most people, know them). It is astonishing that they were such early participants in blogging, yet they failed to ever find the right tone.<p>I remember that my first impression of MoveableType was favorable. This was in either 2000 or 2001. I had the impression that it was the best blogging platform around. At that time, the world of PHP only had stuff like PHPNuke, which was unbelievably bad.<p>Once TypePad got going, my impression of Ben and Mena Trott changed for the worse. There was the incident where Mena called out someone for being an ""asshole"" at SXSW, and then her awkward attempt at an apology:<p><a href=""http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2005/12/words-you-shoul.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2005/12/words-you-shoul.html</a><p>Is appropriate to use this language when you are talking to your customers? Even if this is your honest opinion, is this the best way to express yourself?<p>If the goal was to alienate their user base, they went about it with scientific precision.<p>I recall at one point Mena wrote a post where she talked about how her and Ben were trying to learn how to enjoy wine, rather than always drinking soda. To me, the post had a quality of ""Everyone says blogging is suppose to be personal and we are suppose to be pioneers in this field, so I will now try a post on a personal topic."" Possibly others enjoyed her attempt at being transparent, but to me the tone was forced and awkward.<p>My overall sense then, and still now, was they were lucky to be early into blogging since if overlapped with their personal interests (Mena wanted to better organize her sewing circle by posting announcements online, so she asked her husband Ben to create some software that would make it easy for her to do so - this was the beginning of MoveableType). Once they realized they had something valuable, they wanted to commercialize (which is understandable). But after that they seemed to be in over their heads. They never seemed able to establish real rapport with their user base.",1285105596

It's quite possible that increasing the rate can lead to a net decrease in total tax revenue. And in some cases, lowering the rate can lead to an increase in revenue. This is known as the Laffer curve. See <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Laffer_curve"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Laffer_curve</a><p>While this concept is the subject of some controversy, it's demonstrably true at the extreme. Raising the rate to near 100% will clearly decrease revenue. But on the other hand, decreasing it to 0% will also decrease revenue. But with more moderate values, it's really anyone's guess as to whether it will hold or not.<p>It's the same in business, really. One's revenue can increase by decreasing prices: more people will buy your product, and that may be enough to offset the per-unit loss.<p>What's really controversial is the question over how much people will forgo additional income due to changes in marginal tax rate. There are certainly boundary conditions, such as when the amount you finally take home after taxes is less than your cost for child care. More fuzzy is when the amount you take home is less than your value for free time.",1285105002

He says, ""realizing that the compiler was just one (incomplete) form of testing,""<p>Strong typing is really just a form of testing.  But it has a couple of advantages.  It is a form of testing with strong mathematical underpinnings.  If someone says their application is correct with respect to the type system, I know what that means in a pretty precise way.<p>This has a couple of side benefits.  When working in modular units or decoupled teams, when one team gets some code they know that if type checking has passed a set of requirements have been met.  They understand what that means.  While unit tests are useful, you passing your unit tests means very little to me, until I spend a few days going through your unit tests.<p>Another benefit is that all of your code gets these tests run on them.  One of the few tests that gets 100% code coverage all the time.<p>Examples of famous bugs that could have been avoided with a strong type system include the NASA Mars orbiter bug.  If they used a language like Ada that supports having English and Metric integer types, they would have been sure to mix them properly.  And of course the compiler could enforce this through all of the code.<p>While Bruce does point out that weak typing (or dynamic typing) may result in less typing, it generally doesn't result in easier thinking.  For me that makes it a relative wash in that regard.",1285104709

We likely have some unresolvable disagreements on politics.<p>In a post below, you went on and on with a lot of what I called ""nonsense"":  Do such work as well as you please, and the results will still be nonsense.  Sorry:  That direction just gets deeper and deeper into stuff for which there is no reasonable solution.<p>You seem to have some quite broad <i>educational objectives</i>:  Those promise to be very expensive and have highly mixed results, e.g., a gigantic waste of time for any very capable student.<p>We should agree:  For the main academic subjects, such as considered in the McKinsey study, etc., it really is possible to have standardized tests that really are in practice essentially the best measure of learning.  Indeed, that you take seriously the McKinsey analysis of the results of just such tests implies that you agree.<p>Are such tests perfect?  No.  Better than anything else widely available?  Yes.<p>From my experience, the tests of the US Educational Testing Service are about the best measures of learning in K-12 and at least early college academic subjects.  The test results are well respected for admissions to both college and graduate school.  Net, these tests are a good resource for an effort to make progress in the US <i>educational system</i>.<p>Okay, have various <i>paths</i> to <i>education</i>. Have classrooms, special education, private schools, guided home schooling, etc.  Fine.  But, for all the paths, evaluate the learning with accepted, well designed tests, e.g., from ETS.  So, the various <i>paths</i> have the same measure, the test scores, and much the same, real educational goals; so, the paths are in competition.  GOOD.<p>Have all the paths you want, but for my kids I'd home school them with the goal of having them be ready for college work by age 10-12 and graduate work about three years later and having them do some research, publish some papers, take GREs, use those and the published papers to get accepted to grad school, take the qualifying exams, submit the published papers as the dissertation, and, thus, after less than two months on campus, one year later get a Ph.D. and to HECK with more in academic education.  Only one degree -- Ph.D.  Period.  We're talking cutting out lots of expensive, time-wasting, psychologically wacko nonsense from nearly irrelevant down to totally upchuck-able.<p>E.g., some girl 13 gets to concentrate on learning calculus and not her hair style, doing well in her education and not gossip and social climbing.<p>For your main struggles and concerns, I outlined a simple, special path to the tests that should please you:<p>""Here we cut out a lot of nonsense:  If someone wants to learn, then sit in a cubicle with a computer, work through some of the best educational materials, take the test, and see how well they do, and then all the credit and/or blame is just theirs.""<p>The ""nonsense"" I'm talking about you described with lots of references:  As I mentioned, in that direction the swamp just gets deeper thicker with no hope.<p>Here's how this simple, special path addresses many of your concerns:  As we know, on the Internet, no one can tell if you are a dog, nerd, wearing pajamas, blond, brunette, red head, white, black, brown, yellow, Christian, Jew, Muslim, African, Northern European, Russian, Mideastern, Asian, Hispanic, etc., rich, poor, handicapped, handsome, ugly, too thin, too fat, popular, socially awkward or if you are living with 1, 2 parents, natural or not, previously were an academic success or failure, were good or bad at other academic subjects, were good or bad at athletics, what your sex or age is, are pregnant or have been pregnant, have a bad reputation from siblings that went before, have an address in a good or bad neighborhood, etc.  So, study the materials via the Internet, take the tests, submit the scores, and totally avoid any issues about <i>social</i> this and that.  Don't look for a simpler solution.<p>Yes, the cry will go up:  ""But, but, but, this is too narrow and omits oceans of adult face time just so totally CRUCIAL for <i>social</i> and <i>civics</i> maturations ...."".  Yup, and also even more crucial for the teachers unions, really high real estate taxes, nearly meaningless or wasteful and even devastating social and athletic, but not academic, competition, making a king and queen out of the quarterback and head cheerleader and social serfs out of everyone else, degenerate <i>pop culture</i>, bullying, etc.  That system IS especially good for getting all the students started on drugs and getting the sixth and seventh grade girls sexually active.<p>Besides, here are some facts of life about learning, especially relevant on Hacker News:  Mostly people, for their careers and everything else, have to keep learning all their lives.  Nearly all of this learning is self-directed, self-taught, and pursued independently or largely so.  In particular, for all of the history of the US computer industry, nearly all the learning in the labor force has been self-taught -- assembler, Fortran, Cobol, APL, PL/I, Knuth's <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>, SQL, C, C++, Dijkstra semaphores, communicating sequential processes, the fast Fourier transform, Java, HTML, MemCache, .NET, etc.  So, students who can, should get started on such learning ASAP.<p>Yes, next the cry will go up:  ""But, but, but, what about students who for any of a long list of reasons would fall through the cracks and, thus, create problems for decades for themselves and the rest of society?  These students need the help of good teaching.""<p>Fine:  I did indicate that there should be multiple paths to the tests.<p>We can't hope to make much progress arguing with the teachers unions or by pursuing arguments about <i>nature</i> versus <i>nurture</i> or genetics.  So, for the whole debate, the whole issue, we need to get some clarity, simplicity, alternatives, and competition.  So, for these ends, start with some good tests, e.g., from ETS.  Then have multiple, competitive paths to the tests.  In particular, one of the paths should be very high quality learning materials available via the Internet.<p>For the teachers unions, let's get to see how well their students do on the tests against students with home schooling and the Internet!<p>Or, for an example, if want to take part of the movie at the intended face value, then consider the students and parents so eager to get the students into <i>charter schools</i>:  Such eagerness should serve well for a student with a computer, using high quality materials on the Internet, working through the materials, doing the exercises, taking the tests right along, AND seeing right then how well they did.<p>Look, guys:  How to learn such material just ain't too obscure:  The learning is NOT a <i>spectator sport</i>; all that's required is just working through the material which should be easy enough for any eager student or for any student with determined parents!  ""Sandra, do well on the test on integration by parts and THEN you can gossip with your friends, go shopping for a new dress, and watch your chick flick.  Do really well and you can get two new dresses and two chick flicks.  No, you can't go <i>park</i> until 3 AM with that college boy you met at McDonald's."".<p>E.g., nearly everyone on Hacker News worked through Kernighan and Ritchie with its overly succinct writing, sparse content, the tortured, obscure, <i>idiosyncratic</i> syntax of C, no details on the internals of malloc(), way too little detail on stack usage and its storage usage, too little in exercises, no tests right along, no final test at the quality level of the ETS, and still <i>got it</i>.  The required learning work just ain't too difficult.  We know we can do such work, for C, high school and college math, science, languages, history, etc.<p>Let's cut the nonsense, see the tests, prepare for the tests, get on to more, and cut out all the social this and political that.",1285104018

My dad lived in a slum for five bitter years in Taipei living off US$20 a month, and never let anyone know how poor he was or that he ate white rice every night. His only ticket out was betting it on the College Entrance Exams.<p>What saved him was that in Chinese culture, you have the ability to move up through tests and exams. So while I have a lot of problems with standardized exams, he was also able to move up because he was smart.<p>However, my main beef with your post is that you seem to think that anyone can fix their problems at any time. I don't know why you turned this into a pro-Capitalism article, or why you turned this into a you-can-fix-this-yourself article, because I don't think my Dad needed help from anyone, but the empathy to understand that when both your parents are effectively dead and you're trying to get an education and basically enough food to subsist, it's more than about leftism. It's about being a human being. When you're 13, and have no parents, what choice do you really have?  There is no easy fix until you have that degree.<p>And for your information, my Dad relied on no government help, other than what was provided to everyone, public schools. But to think that anyone can make decisions to be move up is foolish thinking.<p>Should he have dropped out of school and ""fixed"" the problem as you proposed by working long days?  My Dad didn't need any help from anyone. And he worked hard getting into the best university in Taiwan, National Taiwan University. But don't imply that poor people have control over their situation. That is arrogant and wrong.<p>When you're faced with a Hobson's choice--to drop out of school and forfeit a future with maybe a bit of comfort, or to stay in school but have little comfort--I think you'll agree with me that there's little choice at all. But it is insulting to assume that there were better choices he could have made. Save money on food? He's already eating white rice on 67 cents a day!  ""Being poor is not budgeting"" -- how is this even possible, being a high school student, with no sources of income or parents?<p>Moving up, as a young kid before even having the opportunity to be in college, isn't as easy as you think.",1285103393

Seriously. I know several people intimately who grew in a ""more kids than space"" situation and I can assure that none of them would rather delete a sibling than have a little more space. It is nice to give lots of space to people if you can; if you can't, it is better to have people than space.<p>As far as a spouse running off or going crazy, that happens sometimes. Nobody marries someone thinking that they are just going to end up divorced. Things happen to people, including things beyond their own control.

The weekly task of checking to see who can turn up to the match and possibly finding replacements could be largely automated and it is actually a simpler problem than a pickup game. You'd basically just have to sell the team organiser on this and they would enforce usage within their team. No real need for 'network effects' for it to be useful. Once you had a base of sports enthusiasts things like organising scratch games and even 'scratch tournaments would be possible.",1273370397

Really really great idea.\nThere are a couple of things to consider (I'm sure you've already thought of them) - mainly even healthier restaurants have unhealthy items and the reverse applies to unhealthier restaurants. There ought to be a way for limitation and inclusion. Attemtping a partnership with Yelp might be of some use interms of trying to keep partner restaurants honest.<p>Also, like any association - the guidelines of this healthy-restaurant-coupon-association will be public and under intense scrutiny - especially from the big boys in the food industry.<p>#2 - This is a bit crowded right now.<p>#3 - I don't know if this is already being done and if so, in what capacity, but.. there are many resources for building confidence, empowerment etc... this will be a marketing-heavy project.<p>#4 - So now rich people have even more escape route incase they blow up the world ten times over? :P. I think its a fantastic idea... fear sells. This is a well-known fact.<p>#5 - Pretty cool. How about a cross-roads style exchange program built into a basic-goods store instead? I bet someone like IKEA could probably run this (not sure if it has already been pitched). This has cool written all over it. One might even get away with running it like Netflix (order a care package... it comes with a box that you can return the whole thing in).<p>#6 - Neato. I'll second that AirBnB can already do this with their existing tech... but why would they want to? Unless they're really looking to expand their business horizontally. On the other hand, craigslist could really do this and they wouldn't be shifting focus at all (its just office space for rent).<p>#7 - A way to ""humanize"" them isn't good enough. We're talking about putting people's pictures and stories online - I mean, its bad enough that these people have zero privacy. There have to be massive benefits for them to want to do this... why should I, homeless Joe, tell you my story? Whats in it for me? Whats in it for anyone?<p>There's a spreadsheet of people available to join a startup floating around on HN.

1331339,comment,1330989,1331087,0,0,Dove,,,"Facebook adapting would be a good thing.<p>Back in 1998 or so, on an obscure corner of the internet, there were three or four competing ladders for a game I played.  The same dynamics were in play as on social websites: it was critical to play on the ladder with the best coverage of your local community, and games absolutely could not be transferred between them.   One ladder rose head and shoulders above all the others, offered gamers features and respect that no other ladder did.  Its passion for the game and commitment to the community crushed the competition, and it became the <i>only</i> place to play this particular game.<p>Years went by.  A generation of gamers came who had never known anything but this one ladder.  (Generations go fast on the internet).  It was considered unassailable, owning the community and the legacy the way it did.  And given that, small offenses against the community itself began to accumulate.  Rules out of step with the popular notion of what was fair in the game.  Absentee administrators who didn't see eye to eye with those who still played the game.  Allegations of cheating by players poorly investigated.  Lots of whining by people who felt they were ill-treated, met with the response, ""You're free to leave if you hate it here so much.""  Only they weren't.  There was nowhere else to go.<p>Then one of the players who'd had enough organized some competition.  He put together a cabal of talented players to seed a new ladder.  He recruited me to write the software for it, drew up a new rules set together with those more in touch with the community.  For six months, development of the new ladder consumed many of my evenings and weekends.<p>The launch attracted disgruntled players in droves.  Many players hated the old one and flocked to us.  Many hated the new one and refused to play there.  Many played on both.  But we definitely had hit on a genuine need for a place more in touch with the mores of the community, and within months, we were the more popular of the two.<p>Both ladders operated for a couple more years before the game eventually died.  But which ladder lasted longer didn't matter.  The <i>existence</i> of an alternative changed the politics at both places.  It changed what people expected from their leadership, and it made it possible to just . . . leave.  We wanted to build a better ladder, and in some ways we did, but we changed the dynamics of the game community as a whole.  I think even the old ladder saw a longer life because of us.<p>You can try to build a walled garden, but you can't stop cultural transfer.  At some point, when the administration gets far enough out of step with the population, when there's a better way to do things and they don't take it, alternatives arise.  After that, it doesn't matter whether the old guy adapts to compete or dwindles and dies away.  The place is changed.  The game is changed.  They have to do better or another challenger will arise.<p>Facebook doesn't have to lose.  Facebook being forced to adapt would be enough.  Revolutions change even those who don't join them. The protestant reformation changed the catholic church.  The American revolution had implications in Europe and ultimately China.  The digital revolution has changed the way magazines and newspapers are written.<p>If you build a service where people really <i>can</i> send steamy love notes to their girlfriends, post pictures of their 21st birthday parties for friends, or air some unpopular political views, and feel assured that this information will not be seen by the wrong people . . . if you really <i>can</i> make a Facebook with robust privacy, people will want it.  There's a real need, not just for nerds, but for normal people.  To a serious challenger, Facebook would have to adapt or dwindle in relevance.  And the outcome of that doesn't really matter.<p>Build a private, secure, federated social network today, teach people why they need it, and tomorrow everyone will expect it.  Whether it's <i>called</i> Facebook or Diaspora will matter very little.  The world will have changed.",1273369710

For instance, if Sony's closing price was 100 yesterday, today the lower and upper limits would be 80 and 120. If the price goes down to 80, Sony stops trading.  That's a kind of interventionism and some people don't like it, because you might have the stock and there might someone willing to buy for 79 but you can't sell it.

Maybe I'm stupid, but I didn't even understand what the supposedly better ""other way"" is.<p>The MPI codes I've seen are scientific codes where the data is a large domain that can only fit distributed across many nodes, and where there are interactions that must be passed between these. Typical examples are hydrodynamics codes, N-body codes, radiation transfer codes, or combinations thereof.<p>Can someone explain to me in an understandable way how they think these applications should be coded?",1273367207

In particular, will they able to verify that Eternal Earth-Bound Pets is fulfilling the contract?<p>One authority says ""I don't know if they should necessarily trust atheists to take care of them"". Atheists might torture your pets or leave them to die. What about not-so-true Christians like Catholics, Anglicans and Orthodox people, who don't believe in the Rapture? Will they ascend anyway? It looks like they would be a better choice of pet carers.",1273367041

The people (a lot of them from private schools) at the at the finals were really, really good.  Our poor teams from Kamloops, and 100 Mile house didn't know what hit us.<p>We actually had both approaches to debating in terms of advance preparation, one time we knew in advance, and so had time to prepare (My high-point in those debates was using the text from Catholic Doctrine that demonstrated abortion was acceptable if the purpose of the operation had some other principle medical reason - hard to do if you haven't had a chance to do the research in advance), but we also had one in which we showed up without knowing the topic in advance - the rationale I thought, at the time, (or had been told) was so that we didn't have to do even _more_ studying around mid terms.  Maybe it was just a debate format.<p>We definitely switched back and forth (sometimes with just a 5 minute break in between) between the Pro/Con on each topic - though the way to weasel out of actually doing that was the way it was done by the debaters cited by the OP in the prison - they didn't argue against providing education to Prisoners directly, they argued against the entire educational structure.<p>We also switched from Cross Examination to Parliamentary throughout the debates, and some significant time was spent on what was an acceptable level of ""Heckling"" during Parliamentary, and what would be scored down as abusive.  I recall in the finals one effective debater absolutely devastating her opponent with ""Point of information - I'd  like to note that the honorable member opposite has his fly down.""  :-)<p>[Oh, and just to make things insanely difficult, there were a few round thrown in that were in _french_ (And this is in British Columbia) - I'm not sure how you got selected into that round, presumably some bilingual competence was a pre-req]",1273367034

With current rates of obesity, people should be forced into eating healthier when they can't manage it themselves.<p>Here's a couple ideas of my own I've never had time to implement:<p>1) A solution for (web based) businesses that intelligently auto-detects and flags suspected negative activity before it happens using behavioral analysis. I've got pages and page of writing and diagrams on this. Originally developed as a concept around Paypal security but applicable across most websites.<p>2) A Social Network related to the pay it forward concept promoting compassion among people.<p>3) Google Voice has an app for Android and Blackberry, but not iPhone/iPod/iPad. Voice may be very difficult, but just making a web interface that looks and acts like a native application to send and receive SMS messages on iPod touch or iPad would be huge.<p>4) Configurable status boards such as Panic's( <a href=""http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/</a>) or Cultured Code's (<a href=""http://culturedcode.com/status/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://culturedcode.com/status/</a>) that mesh easily with popular project management systems like Basecamp, etc.<p>Enjoy",1273367024

Remind them that this is Startup News so it would be good if the posting was applicable. Tell them where to find Slashdot if that's what they want. And explain that they are not the only ones with RSS feeds so they don't need to just copy links from there to here.<p>Personally, I think news quality has degraded since karma came along. Some people are clearly keen to move up the leader board and starting a new thread is one way to do that. How about not rewarding karma for a thread's score? It can still be voted up by others to show it's interesting but karma must be earned by quality comments on the thread. Either that, or let us down vote threads to penalise non-applicable threads.<p>Better statistics may help show some light. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=18085"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=18085</a>",1178621012

I told him to get himself back to the aid station soonest and drink water and electrolytes.  The electrolytes are important, because you can actually die from drinking too much water if you don't take in any electrolytes.<p>To bring things a little bit more on topic, I guess the important message is:<p>Take care of yourself (and the people around you).  A failed company might suck, but it's better than serious damage to your health or relationships with people who really count.",1178619108

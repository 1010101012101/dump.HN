You should be able to significantly improve performance with a few changes .. <i>in code written enough</i>. Here, the code is modular so a given sort of slow thing should happen in only one place.<p>But naturally, <i>in poorly written code</i>, you need rewrite to optimize or to improve quality or to change anything else. It makes me wonder which kind of code he's looking at in making his generalizations. I'd agree it is never too early to write good code.",1313261920

I think mcpherrinm was just saying that you have to do a lot less work than for x86, for example, in order to get a minimum of functionality.<p>Unfortunately I don't know of any guides on implementing a toy OS on ARM. The operating systems course I've taken was a decent starting point, but it mostly deals with theory: [0].<p>There's also a first year ARM architecture course: [1]<p>Another course I've taken was about ASM programming on ARM, plus programming some simple hardware[2].<p>I'm not sure how useful are those materials for someone not taking the courses, but they might offer a list of things to look up somewhere else. Wikipedia actually has some good background theory.<p>Finally, you might look over the ARM port of EDK2[3]. EDK2 is a BSD-licensed implementation of UEFI[4]. It implements a lot of the functionality of a regular operating system, with the notable exception of multithreading. I find the source code of EDK2 to be easier to understand than the source of the Linux kernel. Probably because it is a lot more lightweight. You can run it on BealgeBoard, by the way.

Skip to slide 18. In it, the guy talked about premature optimization, curiously, of the same thing: linear iteration over an array vs using a hash implementation.<p>His example was that in his youth, he was on the Doom forums, and he was doing mods, and took a look at the code that loaded the different asset files. And he was abhorred that the code used an array to linearly iterate over to find the asset to load. He started complaining on the newsgroups, and then Doom guys said you don't know what you're talking about, etc.<p>In this case, it was where that code just didn't matter in terms of run time, because the order of magnitude difference in looking up an asset and actually loading the asset was huge, and it just didn't matter. And because they used a dumb implementation, they could optimize for developer productivity and go on to code that mattered, like the rendering.<p>That said, I think the thing to keep in mind is, which parts of your problem space is of the core importance, and keep an eye on difference of order of magnitude in the different solutions you were thinking about implementing",1313260939

My ex was a slow talking, quiet sort (and shy/introverted) and I tend to talk a lot and talk fast.  A big issue in our marriage was when we argued and I felt like I took really huge pauses to try to get him to speak but he still wouldn't speak so I would resume talking to fill the silence.  His take on it was that I never ever shut up and there was no way to get a word in edgewise.  I imagine if we had overcome this issue, the marriage would have gone a great deal more smoothly.  I had to actively teach our younger son, who is more like his father in this regard, to simply ""interrupt"" me and his fast-talking older brother.  Otherwise, he feels like we don't ""let"" him talk.  There is a big disconnect in the internal timing here -- he seems to not be able to judge how/when to jump in the way his brother and I do.

Be aware though that it doesn't allow you to make calls over cell data, but rather limits you to making/receiving calls on Wifi only.<p>In terms of upstream providers the only one I know of in Europe is Blueface[2] as a few of my friends at home in Ireland use them in their homes<p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.blueface.ie/residential.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blueface.ie/residential.aspx</a>",1313259537
2881571,comment,2877563,2880769,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Part II<p>For the CS topics you listed, e.g., programming languages, that field has for decades just cried out for some good math but gotten nearly none!  Clearly compiling and executing a program are necessarily mathematically something, understood or not, powerful or not.  For progress, we need to understand the subject mathematically.  E.g., given a programming language statement, what are its mathematical properties so that given a sequence of two such statements, what are the mathematical properties?  Can't see any?  Okay:  Change programming languages until can.  Then with the properties, what can we conclude about the program?  Anything useful, say, about correctness, running time, storage utilization, approaching limitations?  Given some properties, can we have some code transformations with some known properties?  Are some such useful?  If not, can we define some useful programming languages that admit such transformations?<p>There are some simple, illustrative, pregnant cases that just leap off the screen:  Write a collection of routines for sort by surrogate, i.e., finding a permutation, maybe honoring sort 'stability', applying a permutation to an array, chasing through the fact that each permutation is a product of disjoint cycles, etc.  Then with such routines, will see some properties that are close to algebraic, e.g., where some combinations of the routines are the identity transformation, where one routine is the algebraic inverse of another, where we might have commutativity and/or associativity, or are equivalent to other combinations, etc.  Can we preserve sort 'stability'?  So, we see that we should have an 'algebra' of those routines and be able to derive known properties.  Then we see that due to 'boundary' limitations, etc., our algebra is only roughly correct.  So, maybe we should fix that.<p>This is old stuff.  It has leaped off the screen for decades.  We want some known properties we can use to derive new, useful properties.  Instead all we get is programming languages that compete in some absurd 'beauty contest' or that 'encourage' programming 'styles' seen as 'helpful'.  Sicko.<p>E.g., it has been common now in server farms to be concerned about reliability.  So, we set up systems so that when system A gets too busy or fails, then system B takes over, etc.  However, what we've seen, including at some of the most important farms, for decades, up to this year, is that these intuitive approaches far too easily go ""splat"" in the mud:  They are 'unstable', have problems that propagate, and are surprisingly UNreliable.<p>So, we need some new math of 'reliability' for such server farms, math that can write us some guarantees.  That math will start with the real problems, have definitions, theorems, and proofs, and, if successful, some solid tools for building reliable server farms.<p>All across computing, CS needs to give us progress, and for that they need to proceed essentially only mathematically.<p>It's the math.  The CS is the math.  Server farm reliability is just the application of the math and is not the CS.  Ignoring math, CS is ""A little people.  A silly people.""!  Until CS gets serious about the math, it is writing checks its methodology can't cash.<p>To get serious about math, CS first has to learn LP well!<p>The would you believe probability?  How about stochastic processes?  Any stochastic processes in server farms and networks?  Any uses of the axiomatic derivation of the Poisson process?  Any roles for one of the strongest inequalities in math, the martingale inequality and the associated convergence theorem?  Measure preserving transformations as in ergodic theory -- I'll answer that one, ""Yes!"".  The renewal theorem and loads at server farms?  How 'bout a little in probability?<p>Understanding now?",1313259536

2881566,comment,2877563,2880769,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Part I<p>""Anyway, who is claiming anything for their own?""<p>From CLRS and much more, it is fully fair to say that CS is ""claiming"" that linear programming (LP) is part of CS.<p>Beyond what I've mentioned so far about LP in CLRS, there is a much bigger reason to claim that CS is ""claiming"" LP:  The history is that operations research wrestled with integer LP (ILP).  There is a claim that for a while G. Dantzig, the inventor of the simplex algorithm, looked at ILP and guessed that he would be able to modify the simplex algorithm to handle integers easily.  Of course, decades later, no one has!<p>So, slowly the image appeared:  In worst case, for exactly optimal solutions, the ILP algorithms had running time exponential in the size of the input data.  So, they were like total enumeration.  Bummer.  So, then, asymptotically, polynomial would be faster, and Jack Edmonds said that a 'good' algorithm had polynomial running time in the worst case.<p>Klee and Minty showed that with one of the most popular pivot rules, simplex had exponential running time; the assumption has been that with any pivot rule, simplex is exponential.<p>Practice showed that with the usual practical problems on an LP with m constraints, the running time was about 3m iterations and, thus, polynomial on average.<p>K. Borgward did some 'random geometry' and showed that on average simplex would have polynomial running time, explaining the 3m performance.<p>Eventually Shor, Khachiyan, etc. showed a polynomial algorithm for linear programming based on cutting planes for ellipsoids.  Alas, apparently whenever the polynomial algorithm was faster than simplex, both ran too long to be practical!<p>So, for the first test of the importance of polynomial algorithms, the effort fell face down in the mud:  Simplex is exponential worst case and polynomial average case, and the polynomial algorithms are essentially never faster in a practical way!<p>So, dear Bell Labs was working on designing communications networks, discovered the role of ILP, encountered the worst case exponential execution time, and got with the theory of NP-completeness and wrote:<p>Michael R. Garey and David S. Johnson, 'Computers and Intractability:  A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness', ISBN 0-7167-1045-5, W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, 1979.<p>Here can see the role of the 'satisfiability' (SAT) problem -- it is in NP-complete.<p>Presto!  CS, long interested in 'computational complexity', especially running time, and, of course, regarding SAT as part of both EE and CS but not really operations research or optimization, takes NP-completeness as its own!<p>In money, students, profs, department sizes, headlines, etc., poor, little operations research, optimization, and even all of applied math can't compete with CS.  So, CS grabs LP, ILP, network flows, NP-completeness, etc. along with SAT!<p>Okay, CS, it you are going to hijack all of 'combinatorial optimization', then realize that progress will require some good math research, and step up to the math.<p>Now back to this thread:  So far, as in CLRS, CS is having trouble even writing with high quality about the simplex algorithm.  So, putting combinatorial optimization and NP-completeness in the butter finger, dirty fingernails, unwashed hands of CS is a bad move for the future.<p>That's some of the larger story about the significance of CS hijacking topics from applied math.<p>Am I torqued?  Sure:  CS grabs the ball, claims to want to run with it, and then falls into the mud.  I'm calling them out on it.  It needs to be done.<p>""Throw me the ball!  Throw it to me!  I can score ....  Splat.""  CS, even at MIT, too often can't even write with high quality about the simplex algorithm.  REALLY big BUMMER.<p>Just like on a ball team, just ain't throwing CS the ball anymore.  Again, they need to clean up their act in math.  As CS hijacks LP, simplex, ILP, network flows, combinatorial optimization, and NP-completeness, they are getting into some of the hardest math research in all of history.  For that they will need to be good at, would you believe, a junior level ugrad course in LP, and even there, even the MIT profs, need to 'pull up their grade'.<p>There's a war story:  In some parts of 'enterprise software', a user gets to enter 'constraints'. E.g., let's figure out what we are going to do in the factory today.  We know that want all the trucks loaded by 5 PM.  Want all the painting done by noon so that it can be dry by 3 PM in time to be packed.  Only have 2000 gallons of paint so whatever we do today has to use no more than the 2000 gallons.  Etc.  So, not really optimizing but are just 'satisfying'.<p>So, seeing this enterprise software problem, CS started the field of 'constraint logic programming'. Great!  Hot new field!  Charging forward!<p>Only a few weeks later, CS discovered that writing software to take just any collection of constraints and satisfy all of them is not so easy.  I mean, even permitting using things as awesomely powerful as neural nets, AI, and, even, genetic programming, it wasn't so easy!<p>A few weeks after that they discovered that even if all the constraints are linear, it's not so easy! Soon they learned a lesson from operations research:  They were looking for a feasible solution to an LP, and generally finding if there is a feasible solution is about the same 'difficulty' as finding an optimal solution.  So, really, the linear 'constraint satisfaction' problem is not much different than just LP.  Sorry guys.  Better luck next time.  Pick yourselves out of the mud and hit the showers.<p>So, SAP got interested in a French company that was interested in R. Bixby's LP software C-PLEX.<p>And the hot, new CS field of 'constraint logic programming' got to look a bit silly.  Splat.<p>On my research paper, grow up!  We're talking adult level activity here!  No longer is it fair to plead that haven't covered that material yet!  Instead, the goal is progress in research.  If start with a computing problem, then the research is 'CS'.  We do the research the best way we can.  If we have a powerful, clean, rock solid solution with some new math theorems and proofs, then okay.  So be it.  That's just part of 'research'.  If CS doesn't yet know this material, then maybe they will have to learn it.<p>Parts of academic finance learned about stochastic integration.  Parts of mathematical physics learned about that math also along with Riemannian geometry and Hilbert space theory.  Parts of chemistry learned about group representation theory.  Parts of chemical engineering learned about ILP and dynamic programming.<p>Actually, reviewing my paper was not so difficult:  I suspect that the editor in chief walked the paper to the math department, found a good probabilist, and got told ""The math looks fine; I don't know what it means for CS."".  Then he walked to the CS department, found an appropriate guy, and got told ""It looks good for CS, but I can't say if the math is correct."".  Done.  How hard is that?<p>Grow up:  The math is fair game.  Not only that, the math is the main tool for the future of CS.  If you didn't realize that, then you can say that you learned it first here.  I can understand why one wouldn't get this lesson from CLRS!<p>Net big picture:  Math is by a wide margin the oldest, deepest, most solid, most powerful, and most general subject in all of academics.  Moreover, nearly uniformly, in all fields, the best progress is from 'mathematization' of the field.  Get used to it!  For CS, do the math.  For the applications to computing, do that in the footnotes or the exercises!",1313259366

The middle option is the one to go for.<p>Especially with LLVM which makes compiling your code very easy, and it's got a BSD-ish license, so no problem linking it with your awesome proprietary game.",1313258585

Compiler/Linker/some post-proc tool should be better at that job. It already has all that information.",1313258575

2881523,comment,2881366,2881366,6,0,keiferski,,,"What's with the constant ""you need to get a co-founder"" advice? It almost seems like insecurity: ""well, if you don't get a co-founder (like us), you're doomed! Better give up now."" There are plenty of companies that started with a solo founder, and starting a company solo is better than not starting one at all.<p>Not everyone has the ability or desire to spend 6 months hunting for that perfect cofounder. The exit strategy of someone else is also going to be different, which in my mind is a huge issue. Personally, I despise the idea of an acquisition (vs. building a long-term organization), whereas a majority of the industry feels (and caters to) the contrary. Each additional cofounder increases the likelihood of the ""cash-out"" mentality and gives one less control of the company's future.",1313258548

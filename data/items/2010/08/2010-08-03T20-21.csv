I was (and still am) surprised that the coverage of this jailbreak has been focused almost exclusively on the jailbreak itself rather than the attack vector and its implications.<p>The fact that a zero-day remote code execution exploit can be triggered so reliably in every iOS 4 and iPad 3.x device that the creators could drop a cute ""Slide to Jailbreak"" widget on a web page is alarming. With nothing more than a single rogue link and a bit of Objective C, this exploit could easily be used to produce a worm spread by e-mail or SMS to every contact with a link to the same rogue code, hopping from device to device as users tap an innocent link from a friend. In fact, the action of clicking a link could be bypassed entirely by script injection -- resulting in infection should the user merely browse to a page serving the rouge JS. Considering that the exploit is PDF-based, it's likely that it could also be triggered by viewing a document in Mail.<p>The prospect of iOS worms is very real, and unless Apple begins to take security more seriously (note that this is the second remote code execution exploit accessible from within MobileSafari, and they've yet to even make a peep about this one), I would not be surprised if we begin to see malware on the platform.<p>[ See the original exploit teardown here: <a href=""http://digdog.tumblr.com/post/894317027/jailbreak-with-pdf-flatedecode-filter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digdog.tumblr.com/post/894317027/jailbreak-with-pdf-f...</a> ]",1280869166

Does changing campaign funding solve a fundamental problem? It seems to me that influence can easily be traded for things other than campaign contributions.<p>The energy company lobbies with millions because they can expect the benefits of lobbying to exceed the millions.  The people could easily out-vote the special interests, but they run into the rational ignorance problem: with current technology, the cost of casting an informed vote is greater than the expected benefit.  Isn't that the fundamental problem?<p>The solution, I think, is to create technology which makes it easy for voters to hold their reps accountable, thus shifting the task of accountability into the ""worth it"" category for regular people.

But I guess talking about something is always better than the alternative, no matter how uninformed or flawed the discussion is.<p>I think the ""issues"" category on the geek feminism wiki does a good job of summarizing the ""female-unfriendly"" things[1]. Objectification and a ""sexualized environment""[2] is what the poster refers to can be common on other sites. Sexism[3] and essentialism[4] is something that generally takes the form of attitudes or opinions, and therefor is less obvious. I see this here on HN in various forms e.g. this comment[5] saying ""women are less likely than men to engage in deeply focused solitary activities"". ""Othering""[6] is something you can see even on this page.<p>[1] <a href=""http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Issues"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Issues</a>

""Rationality"" is just taking actions which are most likely to lead to your goal, whatever that goal may be.<p>Now, that still leaves us to explain the correlation between (a) rationality in the pursuit of relationships and (b) having ""questionable"" goals like pure sex rather than love.  And I think it can be explained this way:<p>First, sex is a much easier to define and measure goal; it's hard to gather data about how well you have achieved ephemeral things like ""love"".  This makes it less amenable to rational attack.  Second, people who are initially rational are more likely to see the rather unpleasant realities of love (tracing it back to evolution-driven competition) and become cynical of even the existence of love (and so settle for sex).  Third--and I think this is close to what you were getting at--men who have been shunned by women may become so bitter that they don't really want to the love of a woman while still acknowledging that they want sex.",1280868625

Europe has simply chosen a different path to the US, and to pretend that the US is superior in every way is ridiculous.<p>Europe, on the whole, balances lower individual buying power and higher unemployment against taking substantially better care of its citizens, and much better class mobility.  It's certainly arguable that the average citizen experiences a higher overall quality of life in (western) Europe than in the US.  I can absolutely see how that style of life is not for everyone, so it's great that countries like the US exist, but personally, I prefer to live in a european model.<p>As for the value of a degree, when I went into my programme I was a decent enough (for my age) coder, with a serious weight problem and very limited social skills, and when I left I was a better coder with some good fundamental background knowledge, fit, and socially confident.  My degree program did me the world of good - it's fine that it's not the route for everyone, but pretending that all degrees are worthless makes you look silly.<p>edit: It appears that my infrequent reading of The Economist has resulted in an unnecessary rant on my part.

The message may ignore contrary data to get a political agenda across. Until I can review the actual reports the argument is based upon, I can't really say for certain. To truly analyze the information across the nation the feds will have to create a US student tracking and lump it in with K-12 & IRS data. There's a quiet movement to do so - but there's resistance to that idea hence the discussion.

They're no more hostile to man pages than FreeBSD is to info pages.<p>> Ideally you have a man page [...]<p>That doesn't sound very ideal. man pages and info pages are formatted differently and take a different approach to explaining things. Having both would mean that the maintainer of each package would need to expend effort on maintaining both.<p>As an example. Here's the FreeBSD strlen() manpage: <a href=""http://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=3&topic=strlen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=3&topic=strle...</a><p>And the equivalent section in the GNU libc manual: <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/String-Length.html#String-Length"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/String-Len...</a><p>On FreeBSD I'd do `man 3 strlen' at the nearest terminal. On GNU I'd do `info libc' followed by `m string<TAB>' to find that node.<p>You can't easily turn that documentation into a man page. E.g. on FreeBSD you'd have one manual page for malloc(3), but in the libc manual the documentation for malloc and other allocation functions is part of an entire chapter on ""Virtual Memory Allocation And Paging"". You can't easily tear that out into a man page.<p>> They could at least not stand in the way of those who would like to provide them.<p>Well, would the FreeBSD project stand in my way if I started sending them patches to duplicate their documentation in some new format like GNU info or perldoc? Probably yes.<p>Documentation isn't a one-off thing. It incurs a long-term maintenance cost. So it's best to pick one system and stick to it.<p>And really, it's not too much to ask that you just familiarize yourself with the conventions of the OS or system you're using. To stick to just ways of reading documentation I use man, info, perldoc, rdoc, phpdoc, javadoc, online tutorials etc. regularly.",1280867772

In those cases the scope of your employment is clear.  Otherwise you're a professional employee.  (Most programmers are professional employees.)  For professional employees there are no working hours, and no non-working hours either.  Have a good idea in the shower?  Your employer has a potential claim on it.<p>Whether they can claim any given project is more complex, though.

I don't go there for the startup scene, so I can't comment on that but I can comment on lots of the other absurd nonsense:<p>1) <i>$2495 for a 500 sq. ft. one bedroom apartment.</i><p>He's obviously in the wrong part of town and can't figure out how to use the real estate section of the NYT. Extend your commute on the subway by 15-20 minutes a day, or live in Queens or something and you'll shave 70% off of that for a place twice as large. In 10 minutes I found a dozen 2 bedroom apartments for $1600 in Queens. You want to live in an expensive area, then that's what you get. When you model a place like NYC, it's better to think of it as a much larger area. A few blocks is like a few miles of price differentiation elsewhere. Don't like what's <i>right here</i>? Go walk 10 minutes in any direction and you'll be someplace completely different.<p>2) <i>‘Ramen’ money in New York is enough to support three families, and then some, elsewhere.</i><p>I have no idea what he's spending money on. Even if he was pulling down only $60k a year (unlikely as a quant), your apartment is only 1/2 of your gross income. Even after taxes you have like a thousand a month to live on at that rate and no car expenses. Being a quant @ GS, I'd figure you're pulling down another 30-40k/yr gross anyways so you can still have a nice night out once a month. NYC is really not an expensive place to eat. I don't think I've ever paid more than $7 for a stuff me to the gills breakfast. And a decent date-meal for two ran <$120 with drinks. Apparently the author never figured out how to operate a Deli or a Diner.<p>3) <i>can't fit in socially with the wrong social group that I'm just dying to be part of blah blah</i><p>Cry me a river, go to different bars and stop hanging around with people who won't let you into their clique/you already have a girlfriend (at the time) what are you doing picking up chicks? Color me confused.<p>4) <i>In San Francisco, people don’t pay two months’ rent to a real estate pimp: they create Craigslist and make the pimp obsolete.</i><p>I wasn't aware that San Francisco had managed to abolish Real Estate agents. It's funny because craigslist serves other parts of the country and we still have Real Estate agents....<p>5) <i>The intellectual candle-power isn’t there</i><p>And the elsewhere goes on to pine that everybody he wants to hang with is ivy-league. The only thing that he said that makes any kind of sense is that the educational makeup of the in-city schools is all wrong for tech startups. I mean there's NYU-Poly I guess, but that's small fry, Princeton is not really that far away (an hour more than Stanford is from downtown SF by car). But there's a ton of schools with great engineering programs within a day's drive from the city (MIT for example). Am I supposed to understand that the entire educational system of the North East and mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. can't out-compete Stanford?  Again, color me confused?<p>6) <i>One of the biggest shocks upon moving to New York was realizing it had no cafés</i><p>What? At this point I'm not even sure the author has even been to NYC. Which is besides the point, the point he's making is, ""you can’t have startups or revolutionary political movements without cozy cafés to dawdle, work, and plot in."" Because as I noticed before, the author failed to figure out how to operate a Deli or a Diner. He also failed to figure out how to operate a public park, a bookstore, a coffee shop, a donut shop, a bench, a stoop and numerous other public places other than an office where you can sit and meet for long hours in the city. Protip, there's this fantastic huge public place you can use in NYC called ""Central Park"" absolutely free. If that's not ""cozy"" enough, there's a bunch of smaller parks like Madison Square all dotted throughout the city. If  you want to eat while you forment revolution, there's like a Starbuck's on every single block in the city. <a href=""http://kottke.org/05/01/maximum-starbucks-density"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kottke.org/05/01/maximum-starbucks-density</a> Even in 2005.<p>7) <i>The reality is, the food culture in New York mostly sucks.</i><p>I know food can be subjective, but seriously? I'm definitely sure that tales of living in the city are grossly exaggerated and/or he was confused with living in Tampa, FL or something. No wait, I'm sure I've seen a cafe there.<p>7b) <i>blah blah blah, people in SF really all want to be farmers</i><p>Wonderful, if you live in a place with some dirt you can till without getting a fine, you can farm it. NYC is not such a place. Deal with it.<p>7c)  <i>Even the skeeziest convenience store in Daly City or Oakland has a drinkable collection of California wines on offer.</i><p>Like I said, I don't live in NYC, but last I remember was being able to pick up some Sonoma Valley vino at every 7-11 along the East Coast for <$10.<p>7d) <i>In three years of living in New York, I never ate someone else’s home-cooked food even once.</i><p>See #3. You.hang.out.with.the.wrong.people. I'm not sure I can put it more plainly than that. No wonder you couldn't afford anything.<p>One thing NYC is famous for is locally grown produced trucked in in the wee hours of the morning to sell in small stalls. The NYC butcher was the model of meat procurement until the grocery store and strip malls ended that across the country. For goodness sakes, the whole city is basically a farmer's market. You know what's doing gangbusters business? Whole Foods. I barely know people in the city, and I've never lived there, and <i>I've</i> had more home-cooked meals than this poor sap.<p>8) <i>blah blah home depot in NYC only sells nail clippers and 10 cent nails.</i><p>This is really just a jab and the relative masculinity of New Yorkers compared to San Franciscoers. Whatever, the author got eaten up and spit out by the city and simply couldn't handle it, now he wants to spend the rest of his days cultivating asparagus in a plot behind his house. It's really amazing how so many of the tallest buildings in the U.S. can be in one city with no hardware stores in site.<p>He's then absolutely enamored by a real Home Depot, no doubt anchoring a strip mall someplace, and a big box electronics store as <i>proof</i> that SF is a hacker's paradise. <i>yawn</i>, I live in the suburbs and have half a dozen of each within 20 minutes of my house. By this standard, Anytown, US is twice the hacker's paradise than SF since most places have a Home Depot, a Lowes, a local lumber yard, a garden nursery, a stone quarry, a Fry's, a Best Buy and two Radio Shacks.<p>9) <i>Three years in New York, and I went north of 14th St maybe three times. Trips to the Met excepted, of course</i><p>Facepalm. No wonder nobody would talk to you in a bar, it's not because you were a quant.",1280865917

1572550,comment,1572075,1572507,0,0,starkfist,,,"I felt the same way and I moved (back) to NYC after 10 years in SF. The city has changed a bit. There are a lot of things to do outside the tech sector. However, I'm not sure I would say ""art and literature and culture matter"" as much as they seemed to in the past. Manhattan is nearly 100% yuppified now. this is good and bad. It's good in that the whole left coast of Manhattan is now a giant urban park. There are bike lanes everywhere. There are parks everywhere. There's a farmer's market in Union Square every (other?) day. There are free things like movies on the pier, concerts in the park, etc. I saw Dinosaur Jr. for free in central park last summer (?!). It's probably easier to eat healthy food in NYC than anywhere else in the world.<p>The bad things (IMHO) is that there aren't as many interestingly weird music or arts things as there were even 10, 15 years ago. There are no nightclubs. There are no weird music venues in Manhattan. The most avante-garde you are going to get is a band like Grizzly Bear... which is kind of avante-garde but is also a huge national act at the same time. Artists have to live way out in Bushwick, or even further away. I don't really know where interesting art shows go up. I honestly think the number of actual practicing artists and musicians is probably the smallest it has ever been. The indie gallery scene isn't a lot better than SF. There are probably more bookstores in either Seattle or Portland than there are in all of the NYC area, which says something... I'm not sure what.<p>So I won't lie... I was disappointed in the state of artsy-fartsy music and culture when I returned to NYC. But I do like all this other urban parkland paradise stuff. So it's a tradeoff. I don't really know where people are doing interesting art and music stuff... maybe berlin or beijing? I know a lot of artists who moved to LA simply because it's easier to get a lot of space. Even Jeff Dietch moved there.<p>If you're looking for something like Andy Warhol's factory scene, I don't think it's happening here. If you're looking for a girlfriend who is a graphic designer for Kate Spade's website - it's your best bet.",1280865757

If you aren't even well-networked enough to get a job then how the hell are you supposed to be an entrepreneur? Being well-networked is probably the single best predictor of entrepreneurial success, so criticizing the grandfather's advice while telling him to start a company makes no sense.<p>The one thing the kid is probably right about though is not taking the job. When I was a kid we used to talk about McJobs, i.e. jobs with no chances of any upward mobility. These days pretty much every job at a big company is a McJob, so you have to be really careful about working for someone else.",1280865674

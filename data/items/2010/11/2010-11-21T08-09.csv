It's the marginal utility that is assumed to slope downwards (I assume you know this, because you later argue as if you did). But this is the opposite as in your example: It should read dU(x)/dW < dU(y)/dW whenever x > y (not x < y).<p>More importantly, your negative income tax definition is faulty. A NIT has never the form proposed by you. It wouldn't make much sense. Also, if A > 1 (in fact, if A > 0) you <i>always</i> have an incentive to work in your model, assuming dU/dW > 0.<p>And by the way, I don't know where you received your math education, but dU(AW)/dW = A dU(AW)/dW does not follow. For example, let U(P) be a simple concave utility function U(P) = ln(P) = ln(AW). Then dU(P)/dW = d(ln(A)+ln(W))/dW = 1/W != A 1/W.<p>This is all not so bad.

I was pretty fanatically into Ayn Rand and probably a lot like you when I was 17 years old. I've grown out of it; while I appreciate Ayn Rand's influence on my intellectual development and genuinely encourage people to try and understand her ideas, I've found points of disagreement with much of her philosophy.<p>More to the point, I don't find it particularly useful or honest to contribute to discussions if one have nothing more to say than simply applying someone else's opinions to the topic at hand. It's not like physics at all; the solution to a physics problem can be non-obvious, whereas applying Objectivism to the idea of a guaranteed minimum income is a very straightforward exercise. (And, more to the point, not in the least bit convincing if you don't already believe in the Objectivism!)",1290329230

I'm an atheist, and I think that ethics is a science. Applying the same metaphysical and epistemological foundations that give rise to science to ethics (and politics and art by extension) is what I'm advocating.<p>> and at no point did it touch at all on why anything having to do with rights would affect economic output in any way.<p>Yes, and this was intentional. The principle that underlies individual rights is not that it gives rise to increased economic output! (Although it does, this is not <i>essential</i>.) There are plenty of voices out there that will tell you all about the economics of capitalism (AEI, Cato, etc.) But that can't work because economics is not a fundamental field because any economic statement, no matter how trivial, subsumes a great number of concepts.<p>Altruism (a pernicious legacy of Christianity, and before that, ancient Egypt) dominates ethics in the West. It is an awful, irrational and anti-life doctrine, but it will trump economics every time, because ethics is more fundamental in an individual's life than economics is. The only proper way to deal with altruism is to name it, and fight it on principle. You can't do that by talking primarily about economics.",1290328458

Morality, ""fairness"", plays little role - what matters is the power balance.<p>For example, the US (rightly) worry about Chinese military expenditures, especially for blue water navy (which is generally considered the biggest advantage of US army from a geopolitical POV). But right now, the US have more capacity than all the other ""power"" with blue water capability altogether (Russia, France, UK) and more. 40 % os all the money spent in defense by gvts is spent by the US. What's symmetrical about it ? Note that I am not making a judgement, but those are hard facts that nobody can argue with, whatever their opinion is on the matter.<p>Outside the US, analysts generally refer to a ""rebalance"" of powers. That China will reach US-level GDP and above is almost certain - but there is nothing that exceptional about is when you have 4 times more people. China with a GDP/habitant ~ western levels would be incredible, though. Although I am confident I will see China becoming the first power in term of GDP, I would be ready to bet that I won't see GDP/habitant rise at the same level as its western counterparts.

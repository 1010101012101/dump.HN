345077,comment,344779,344840,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It is <i>surprisingly</i> practical. It's fun to browse through. They propagate a lot of the most important Amazon information through, so that you can look at more than just the covers. And I'm sure it makes the designers of book covers, who work really hard at their art, very happy to see online stores like this.<p>Having said that, here are some reasons why I prefer Amazon's usual interface:<p>* Used book prices<p>* links to other editions (including Kindle, audio, etc.)<p>* ""Customers who bought this item also bought"" (with ratings) -- I use this to get a quick grasp of the popular titles in any given genre.<p>* The customer ratings, which are of course being gamed these days, but which continue to provide additional perspective in some cases.<p>And, of course, what this is really missing is the ability to open up the book and page easily through it. That's the real killer app for a physical bookstore, and zoomii seems to have <i>less</i> of it than Amazon.com, not more. Amazon offers ""Look Inside"" for many books, which I don't think is really a great substitute for looking inside a physical book, but it's better than nothing.<p>Is Amazon's interface cluttered? Yes. Is it so cluttered that I'm willing to give up these bits of it in exchange for less clutter? No.",1225111248

These are mostly very small very isolated (like 2 days drive to a store) communities. Generally self imposed by direct democracy or community elders/leaders. I don't know if it works.

IIRC, MS pays a $0.11 dividend per $22 share (price as of this morning).  I'm not very familiar with things relating to stocks, but that looks like an interest rate of 0.5%.  My checking account does better than that, so why would anybody care at all about a dividend that is so low?",1225110697

Seems like if anybody had the ability to change their life parameters to avoid taxes, it would be the uber-wealthy.<p>By taxing capital gains, you hit the millionaire store-keeper who sold his shop and is now retired living on investments, the startup guys just cashing out, the day-trader who made a mint. In short, the transitional folks. You keep slightly-rich people from becoming super-rich. The really rich don't seem to be encumbered by any one nation's tax laws.<p>My opinion only.

Erlang will take care of scheduling it, so that other requests can keep coming in and getting handled, and processing power is divided up between the different Erlang 'processes'.  Writing simple select/poll/event/whatever servers in C is obviously going to kick ass in terms of speed, but things become more problematic when you need to start doing some real processing.",1225109371

9517659,comment,9517069,9517246,0,0,ptrklly,,,"I&#x27;d add a few points:
1) management fees typically decline after the first few years of the Fund, rather than staying at 2% for the entire 10 years. This is to reflect the fact that partners are expected to do more work during the sourcing and diligence portion of a Fund&#x27;s life (typically defined as an &quot;investment period&quot; after which they&#x27;re not allowed to make new investments), and that helping portfolio companies and helping achieve exits takes less time / staff / expense. The GP also typically raises subsequent funds once the investment period is over, the management fees of which helps to fund their overall budget.<p>2) On the carried interest often the VC fund can only earn that <i>after</i> they&#x27;ve returned a certain amount to Limited Partners (called a &quot;preferred return&quot;, and typically ~8%; if they don&#x27;t return an 8% IRR to LPs, they only get the management fee and whatever they earn on their own out-of-pocket contribution.<p>In general I&#x27;d just add that this is a highly negotiated point for each Fund and differs from firm to firm and fund to fund.<p>Source: I work as an advisor to investors who participate as LPs in VC funds.",1431204718

Sure, winds change, MySpaces rise and fall, but it wasn&#x27;t a monetization failure.<p>Anecdotally, just a month ago I was walking and because i live in San Francisco I happened across a corner (Howard and New Montgomery) where there were ~20 girls about 13 years old being polled about their tastes, and the questions I heard waiting for my light was &quot;Do you guys like smartphones?&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;, duh), &quot;Is your phone more important than your TV?&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;, duh), and &quot;What is your favorite app?&quot; and the answer was unanimously Snapchat.<p>Snapchat is the teenagers answer to the question many millennials have fretted about -- &quot;how will ppl born today deal with having all 18 years of their development online&quot;. The answer is: they don&#x27;t put it online. It&#x27;s peer-to-peer and temporary by social contract, even if the technology is imperfect.<p>So far, snapchat has played a savvy game. As an engineer, if they were based in SF, I&#x27;d consider working for them. They have tapped into something. Because my 28 year old wife has also been hooked on Snapchat for what seems like a lifetime now. Her most frequent contacts?

The point the author was making is that the terms of Hooli&#x27;s &quot;investment&quot; basically forced them to waste the money, since the investment wouldn&#x27;t have happened had they not spent it on ineffective advertising using Hooli&#x27;s own platform.  It was that investment that gave Pied Piper its $1B valuation, hence &quot;valuation isn&#x27;t everything&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re probably thinking &quot;I&#x27;d never be so dumb as to take an investment with those terms&quot;, and you&#x27;re right: <i>you</i> wouldn&#x27;t be.  You also don&#x27;t own a billion-dollar company.  I would bet that somewhere in Silicon Valley, there is a unicorn whose valuation is based on a deal with similarly bad terms, and it will blow up in their face in a couple years, and then we&#x27;ll all marvel at how stupid someone can be who ran a billion dollar company.<p>I read the article as a cautionary tale for founders who see &quot;billion-dollar company&quot; and get stars in their eyes.

I also added a Twitter account, which can be found at <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/topcuteanimals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twitter.com/topcuteanimals</a> as well as a Facebook page. I used a neat service called Zapier to post pictures from my site over to the Facebook and Twitter pages on an hourly basis. However, I didn&#x27;t want to run out of the free plan for Zapier so now it is limited to just one update a day.
All the scheduled cron jobs are handled via Laravel Forge which has honestly been a joy to work with. I have been using Git flow via Source tree and host my code in a private Git repository on Bitbucket. This helps with the fact that whenever I plan to make a release or a hotfix, each push to the master branch makes an automated deployment to the live site thanks to Laravel Forge&#x27;s helpful integration. I also use Redis to cache the posts so as not to hammer my tiny server&#x27;s MySQL database too much.

I simply said that I’d hire someone if they knew some things and 27 of my candidates who didn’t know those things asked if I would teach them for fee. I agreed to offer a three-week course on condition they wanted to learn for its own sake and that they were NOT doing it to get a job because I wasn’t guaranteeing anyone would get hired and, besides, the chance any one person would get hired was perhaps 4%.

Creating a more complicated algorithm to save all the posts in a cache that had already been viewed and also saved in a cookie created some unnecessary complexity. In the end, I ended up just showing the last posted image and the button basically takes you to the previous post every time you click it (or tap if using a touch device).<p>I used Import.io to write a crawler API to fetch the top posts.

The short version is, our standards for safety must match the potential dangers.<p>E.g., you&#x27;re dying of cancer? No need to worry about minor (or even major) side effects of medication, because you&#x27;re facing death. There&#x27;s a 1 in a million chance of producing a GMO with worldwide consequences? You have to be absolutely positive, nearly 100% certain they&#x27;re harmless. A handful of studies is nowhere near sufficient (without even addressing the inherent conflict of interest in investigating your own GMO for safety). Even if you had a couple dozen studies on one GMO, could you ensure that level of caution for all?",1431203987

On the other hand, our own greenfield projects have been a pleasure to work with because they focus on implementing most functionality in services rather than in controllers and using services for communication between directives over scope inheritance.<p>Angular 2 tries to cut back on some of the oft misused features like controllers and scope inheritance, but it&#x27;s essentially an entirely new framework because of it. There&#x27;s no clear upgrade path if you&#x27;ve been using these features gratuitously in your project, in which case you&#x27;d probably be better off doing some <i>heavy</i> refactoring, if not a rewrite, anyways.<p>And as far as new frameworks are concerned, React + Om is a much better way to build applications than Angular 2 in my opinion.",1431203929

9517540,comment,9512484,9512484,0,0,BrookeTAllen,,,"BROOKE HERE (the guy from the article).<p>Some thoughts on this discussion…<p>ON PREJUDICES: Often I don’t get what I want because other people have inaccurate judgments concerning me. But what can I expect; who has the time to really do due diligence. And who am I to judge their judgments of me? If I were a judge at court I’d have to recuse myself because I am way too close to my own case.<p>This is not to say prejudice doesn’t exist. It does. And it is not to say it isn’t harmful. It is. Prejudice harms us all and the prejudices that harm me the most are my own; they keep me from being all I can be.<p>When I overlook good candidates because I judge them on irrelevant characteristics then I am constraining my options and that does me no good. Although it would be wonderful if the world was perfect I’ve found it most fruitful to concentrate on the problems closest to me and interestingly they usually involve something about me I could improve upon or resign myself to. I’m happier and more productive when I spend so much time trying to be part of a solution (and not the precipitate) that I don’t have time left over to theorize about what people beyond my influence should be doing.<p>ON MENTAL DISABILITIES: If you spend any time with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders I’m sure you can find yourself and everyone you know in there. It seems to me that strengths and weaknesses of the mind should be considered only if relevant just as with things in the physical realm. I’m not sure where to draw the line, however I rue the day when sociopaths cannot be discriminated against. In any event, I’ve concluded that life is a terminal spectrum disorder we just have to deal with as best as we can (until we don’t have to any more).<p>ON SELF-DISCLOSURE: As a practical matter, if you have an obvious disability the best time to bring it up is right before it becomes obvious. For example, if you have a stutter and you ask for forbearance at the beginning of an interview then you can win people’s hearts and they will be rooting for you. But if you don’t then often they cannot wait for the conversation to end. If your disability is not obvious but might require accommodation later on then probably the best time to disclose it is after you get a job offer and before you accept.<p>If you choose to go public with your issues and make them a cause célèbre then in order to win broad support it will need to be clear that you are doing it for the benefit of people in your circumstances and not just as cover for your own failings. Even then, the recognition you deserve might only come posthumously, but that is irrelevant unless it is recognition that you seek.<p>PEOPLE I’D LOVE TO HEAR FROM:  Although this discussion is interesting I wonder if any of you out there would like my help improving how you hire people. If so, please contact me.<p>I am retired and don’t need to do this, but I want to. If you are stinking rich I can be expensive and if you’re sincerely broke then I can be free. Either way, you have to tell me who you are.  I’m at BrookeAllen.com.",1431202366

If you go with this approach, then you don&#x27;t have to store any state on the server. This is a good approach, because it&#x27;s simple, but it doesn&#x27;t solve the issue, where the response from the API changes while you making the paging API calls. The example used in the article is where an order was deleted, while you were calling the API.<p>I was thinking of using a uuid to generate a continuation token, and storing a copy of the results from the API. Subsequent calls that use the continuation token, would take a subset of these results. This requires storing more state on the server, and managing that state. The benefit to this approach is that results you get back from paging are consistent. This solves the issue, where the results from the API change while you are calling the API multiple times. The downside to this approach is that you have to store more state in server. If you are storing the full results for all of these paging API calls, then this could be quite large.",1431201792

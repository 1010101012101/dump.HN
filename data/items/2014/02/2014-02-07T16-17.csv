7197277,comment,7196500,7196965,1,0,bdcravens,,,"Mt. Gox didn&#x27;t say they were resuming withdrawals, only that they had an announcement to make. There will definitely be a market reaction based on what they say (or if they instead keep silent, it&#x27;ll likely be perceived as negative).<p>Also note that Mt. Gox tends to trade at a 10-15% premium to other exchanges, since most fiat currencies take weeks if not months to withdraw. Right now it&#x27;s like 3%, and overnight, it actually dropped BELOW some exchanges. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what happens when things get back to &quot;normal&quot;. Will Mt. Gox&#x27;s premium return? Will it return in the form of the market discounting other exchanges?<p>It&#x27;s scary that such a poorly run operation (what they have right now is essentially a software bug, due to not accounting for a types of BTC transactions; but they&#x27;ve crashed due to volume and have been hacked, to say nothing of the actions taken against them) can influence the price so strongly.",1391792383
7197276,comment,7196845,7197124,11,0,billyjobob,,,"IMEI blocking hasn&#x27;t stopped phone thefts in Europe.<p>Possible reasons:<p>1. IMEI numbers can be changed.<p>2. Thief can still use phone for many hours until block.<p>3. Stolen phones can be shipped to countries that don&#x27;t implement block.<p>4. A blocked phone can still be used to run apps, play games, make VOIP calls on wifi etc.<p>The Apple system seems much more sensible.  You can&#x27;t use an  iPhone without the pincode, and even if you get that the owner can remotely lock the phone as soon as you connect it to any network. The way to avoid that used to be to wipe the phone and reinstall the OS, but now you can&#x27;t do that without the Apple ID and password of the owner.  I don&#x27;t know if this has reduced iPhone thefts, but unless the thief has an exploit in Apple&#x27;s security I don&#x27;t see why anyone would steal an iPhone nowadays.  I wish Android would implement something similar.",1391792379
7197275,comment,7196293,7196293,3,0,javajosh,,,"This is an interesting theory problem, but it might be clearer to talk about shooters at a firing range, separated by partitions such that they can each only talk to their neighbors. The barriers eliminates the trivial solution of the shout: &quot;Fire on the count of 3!&quot; that common sense would provide.<p>The simplest solution would be to establish a clock, because with a clock you can say &quot;Fire at 1pm exactly!&quot;. But even this is interesting because it requires shooters to know where they are in the line in order to take into account any signal propogation delay. If each person takes 1s to repeat a message that they hear, then it takes n seconds to go down the line, and each shooter must know how to compensate for that delay. E.g. the first shooter hears &quot;it&#x27;s noon&quot;, the next shooter hears &quot;it&#x27;s noon&quot; but knows that he&#x27;s 1s away from the source, and can calculate that the time is actually 12:01, the next shooter knows it&#x27;s 12:02 etc. They could synchronize clocks, specify a time &quot;shoot at 1pm!&quot; and get the job done.<p>But what if we take away their clocks? This is where my intuition fails me, because I don&#x27;t see how the problem can be solved without clocks. If you don&#x27;t have clocks, you need to somehow get a signal to every shooter simultaneously, which I think is theoretically impossible, since without a clock the shooter cannot execute instructions on their own.<p>Which probably means I don&#x27;t fully understand the scenario :)",1391792353

You&#x27;re now not an anonymous pixel but HD video.<p>Second, by correlating the &quot;pixels&quot; with even coarse celltower location over time, you should be able to match a cellphone with every person. In other words, you now know their identity and track almost everyone&#x27;s location to within a foot. No GPS needed.<p>Third, this information could be stored for all time and easily accessed.<p>I think this really is a &quot;game-changing&quot; technology as far as privacy goes.

The proposed law, at least in spirit, would require carriers and phone makers to honor your request to make your device unusable when you report it as stolen. It isn&#x27;t so much that the government is going to be making technology and forcing everyone else to use it -- it&#x27;ll let the private tech industry do whatever it needs to do to comply with the  proposed &quot;please brick my stolen phone&quot; law.<p>I can understand how handset vendors other than Apple would have a problem with this. For example, where is the &quot;activation lock&quot; setting stored and who controls it? The handset vendor (Samsung, LG, etc)? Google (since it&#x27;s an Android phone)? The carrier? Who deals with the customer when the device is stolen?

I would fully agree that this is totally arbitrary; but I don&#x27;t tell others what to like, I just have my own reasons for (not) liking things. And when AI happens I will be convinced that humans partly made it to escape themselves and their responsibility, and so I&#x27;ll be with the luddites, pouting :P",1391790806

I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team/manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed/shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

Let me try to phrase things differently.<p>For every person in the world, there is a cost to recruit them into your organization as an attacker, which I postulate is low for young Arab men and high for Laotian grandmothers (and also high for 80-year-olds generally). Call this cost function COST(<i>x</i>).<p>There is also a likelihood that if they attempt an attack, they will succeed. Call this EFFECTIVENESS(<i>x</i>).<p>I can only interpret &quot;if you make it easy for 80 year olds to get through security, 80 year olds will be the ones with bombs. Whether by recruiting, coercion, or anything&quot; as saying that a terrorist group sending an attacker <i>t</i> will strictly try to maximize EFFECTIVENESS(<i>t</i>). But that&#x27;s wrong. A terrorist group sending an attacker <i>t</i> will try to maximize EFFECTIVENESS(<i>t</i>)/COST(<i>t</i>).<p>Imagine some categories like so:<p><pre><code>    Age Sex Ethnicity  EFFECTIVENESS      COST\n    19  M   Syrian     10%              $20,000\n    80  M   Egyptian   60%             $150,000\n    80  F   Laotian    80%             $250,000\n</code></pre>\nObviously, it&#x27;s easier for the 80-year-old Laotian female to get through security (or they&#x27;re just generally more competent, or whatever).  But it&#x27;s cheaper (80% of the cost), and more effective (25% more expected successes), to send 10 19-year-old Syrian men.  So, in a world where these numbers were accurate, we&#x27;d expect to see terrorist organizations using young Arab men to make their attacks even though they&#x27;re eight times less likely to clear security than 80-year-old Laotian women. That means the correct thing to do with extra security is to completely ignore the high success rates of 80-year-olds and try to drive the effectiveness of Arab teens <i>even lower</i>.<p>> your argument about recruiting rates, while possibly correct, is, well, irrelevant :)<p>I&#x27;m not making an argument about recruiting rates; point me to where I mentioned the concept.  I&#x27;m making an argument about recruiting costs.  Doesn&#x27;t matter why the cost is what it is, or whether your attackers are there voluntarily.",1391790359

Unless we actually discover a super-Turing computational system, any machine will be doing some kind of computation that in principle could be performed by any other Turing-equivalent machine.

There is a happy medium here.  The Rays have figured it out pretty well with Joe Maddon, the NFL will get there too.  No one thinks a machine should call all the plays (yet).

For example, 6 months of parental leave time, subsidized by the state, with 1 month which can only be taken by the mother and 1 month which can only be taken by the father.<p>The ACLU case when when an on-duty officer in plainclothes decided to attend a public meeting, which had no restrictions, and where there was no requirement to identify oneself or one&#x27;s occupation, right? I think ACLU staff attorney Lloyd was clearly in the wrong for ejecting the officer. I don&#x27;t see how the law is &quot;extremely vague&quot; in this case, and agree with the court&#x27;s opinion that the ACLU&#x27;s defense was &quot;strained&quot;, and if the circumstances were changed slightly would be easily seen as &quot;shocking.&quot;<p>Why do you conclude, based on it&#x27;s ambiguous? I think the local ACLU chapter was being stupid, arrogant, and stubborn. It happens. We&#x27;re all human.<p>Personally, as an ex-long-haired man, it&#x27;s nice to know that there are laws (in California at least) which would forbid people from discriminating against me solely because they don&#x27;t like long hair on a man, which is one of the other Unruh decisions.<p>I can&#x27;t speak towards your issues that &quot;most of the attempted solutions have largely served to dig the hole deeper.&quot; I can only speak about specific issues, like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which I assure you did not &quot;largely serve to dig the hole deeper.&quot;<p>In general though, we have different enough view that I cannot have a good discussion on the 3 points that you raised. 1) What does &quot;community&quot; mean, and how is it different than &quot;individuals&quot;? 2) Land ownership is essential only when there are strong property rights. If there are weak ownership rights, such that renters can&#x27;t easily be evicted and owners have strong obligations towards the renters, then ownership is not so important. 3) why is the specific term &quot;business&quot; elevated over &quot;organizations&quot;?

It seemed to me for a long time he was framing the conversation as looking for advice, since when advice was given the conversation seemed to move along rather well.<p>The thing about advice is it almost requires you to invest yourself a little in the other person&#x27;s problem and advice starts turning into involvement, which can be frustrating when the other party doesn&#x27;t follow the advice, as my friend almost never does. Over the years I found that he&#x27;d typically ignore good advice, get himself into trouble, come back for more advice/a way out of his disaster and then repeat until I was getting way too involved in his business. Which left me in a foul mood and our friendship on the rocks.<p>It&#x27;s tempting for the receiver to take that advice/involvement as most people are looking for a little bit of help through problem areas.<p>But I&#x27;ve learned from him that it&#x27;s often better to not get involved at all in other people&#x27;s business, even if it&#x27;s just advice,...no matter how tempting it is. They have to make the mistakes and learn from the experience themselves. And if they can&#x27;t learn from that experience, maybe they shouldn&#x27;t be involved in doing whatever it is they&#x27;re doing.<p>This is really hard to do though, especially for engineer types who view the world as a sequence of problems. There&#x27;s a lot of pop-sociology that men like to fix things and women like to talk about things, which is used to explain the constant need for guys to give advice, and often results in relationship counseling like &quot;just listen to your girlfriend/wife, that&#x27;s all she wants, she&#x27;s <i>emotionally</i> processing&quot;.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bit too gender biased so I&#x27;ve taken that idea and reworked it to &quot;most people just want to vent or verbally process their issues&quot;. Just listen to them, nod a bit, if you have a similar situation try and and talk about it too, but don&#x27;t focus on how you solved it, just dialog. For <i>many</i> people, it&#x27;s about ordering their thoughts so the solution presents itself to them.<p>For my friend, he&#x27;s started to realize where lots of his life faults are, and is <i>slowly</i> coming to the realization that they aren&#x27;t good long-term things to carry around. He&#x27;s looking at lots of digging to get himself out of some bad problems he&#x27;s gotten into, so he keeps looking for an easier alternative/other way out. But letting him talk things out helps him see that he&#x27;s really only got one choice, and it&#x27;s going to take a long time to do it.",1391789142

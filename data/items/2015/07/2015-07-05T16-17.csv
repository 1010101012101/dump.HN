If your program hits an unhandled exception, I&#x27;d wager 9 out of 10 times it&#x27;s unexpected, and thus  the only appropriate behavior is to stop, rather than to continue operating in a potentiallly totally unexpected and silently buggy  (and dangerous) state. Fail hard and fail fast, while not always convenient, is far easier to debug and handle than the proposed alternative.",1436115593

The name &quot;group&quot; in renormalization group was inspired by the groups in group theory, but in reality the renormalization &quot;group&quot; isn&#x27;t a group but a semi-group. A semi-group satisfies the same axioms as a group except for the existence of inverse. And that is the mathematical reason why you can describe big things in terms of smaller things, but you can&#x27;t describe small things in terms of bigger things: the renormalization (semi-) group flows from the ultraviolet to the infrared, but not the other way around :-)",1436115533

Go to Genode.org to see innovation in L4 space, theirs and others&#x27;.<p>I agree on containers and microservices. IT rarely learns the good lessons of the past but often repeats its failures. The first good containers were Burrough&#x27;s apps where they compiled source against a good API with checks at interface level (compile-time & runtime) with full reuse of code in memory to avoid duplication. Hardware-enforced, optional isolation & duplication if you wanted a brick wall. <i>That</i> has both an efficiency and security argument. This new shit might be an improvement on typical Windows or UNIX/Linux deployment but seems to be improving in wrong direction.<p>Best example is still them standardizing on complicated HTTP- and XML-based middleware instead of simpler formats (eg s-expressions) with a grammar I can auto-generate w/ validation checks on TCP/UDP-based middleware which I can also auto-generate w/ validation checks. Designing robust, efficient solutions with mainstream stuff is like walking through a friggin&#x27; minefield of problems.... where it can even be done!

9834089,comment,9832825,9833022,0,0,nemanja,,,"Hey Dan,<p>Redux looks awesome.  I am using react-dnd and hot reloader on my current project and they are great. Thank you for all the great contributions you are making to the ecosystem.<p>The idea of modeling the store as a reducer is clever. Complication I see is that my action creators are often not pure functions (i.e. there is generally a side effect to update the database and persist the change).  However, given the focus of redux on improving the dev workflow, I suppose database updates/side effects could be mocked out. How would you handle this scenario?<p>What would actually be awesome to have and go hand-in-hand with redux is an immutable write-only isomorphic database (for application state persistence), where you use the same initial state/reducer for redux and the database. Database stores initial state, logs actions and computes the current state using the reducer (and caches it) - much like redux on the client. Curious to hear what people think about this or if anyone has seen anything like it.",1436115216

9834018,comment,9830232,9830232,0,0,ianamartin,,,"Just a few observations in no particular order from my point of view (classical violinist and pianist--performing professionally for 28 years, and a music theorist studying the structure, composition, and history of the above for about 20 years.)<p>1. This, and all other similar modern attempts, is interesting in that it has so much in common with the very earliest forms of music notation. We have as a basic, &quot;this is me telling you how this is supposed to sound&quot; example as far back as the 7th century, in which you had written words with markings above, below, and around that are meant to guide chant practitioners about where to go next to shape the musical phrase. This is also the origin of modern punctuation in written language.<p>These attempts are remarkably similar in my mind to the early attempt to guide people. They strike me as memory aids more than anything. As in, I&#x27;ve heard this before, I know how it is supposed to go, I just need a little help here.<p>When I say origin above, I&#x27;m talking about the western tradition of music. The eastern tradition of music evolved very differently (both in terms of music notation and the notion of punctuation), and you can trace early concepts of music notation back a couple of thousand years b.c. But I&#x27;m not talking about that.<p>2. The history of music notation roughly follows the history of the study of music theory in a cycle: is the point to understand and describe what happened in the past, or is the point to prescribe what should happen in the future? People have been fighting this battle for centuries (again, there&#x27;s a parallel here between language and music), and we continually go back and forth.<p>Notation methods carry that same problem with them. What are you trying to do? What problem are you trying to solve? I&#x27;m not going to say that modern standard music notation is perfect, but it&#x27;s a good balance of both prescription and description.<p>3. Speaking of balance, there&#x27;s another element that&#x27;s been mentioned already: creation vs. performance. A good method of notation has to be easy to write, not just easy to read. It has to be specific enough that composers who want to care about details can clearly define them, and I think this method is sorely lacking in that regard.<p>4. Re: ledger lines. These are a modern, notational &quot;convenience&quot; that was brought about by printing technology making it reasonable. And because performers hated music without them. Music before the 18th century did something that is much more reasonable in my mind, but in practice is difficult to manage. The clef symbols used to be moveable. They sort of still are. The difference between alto and tenor clef is that the c is on a different line.<p>In pre-Baroque music, there were only 4 staves instead of 5 and the clefs moved all over the place to accommodate the fact that there were no leger lines. The clefs would switch to a different line in the middle of a phrase or just change completely from a c-clef to a g or f clef.<p>This kind of shifting around is, needless to say, extremely taxing on the performer. But very convenient for the writer and publisher. Leger-lines were originally an acquiescence to the needs of the player, believe it or not. But you know, give someone an inch, and they&#x27;ll write Strauss.<p>5. These kinds of visual aids have existed forever in music. But they are only useful for the performers. Writers of music have to consider vertical relationships between notes. I mean, they don&#x27;t have to, but we&#x27;re stuck in a musical rut where we&#x27;ve collectively decided that the successful music is going to be based on some permutation of I-V-I. And that&#x27;s even more true of modern i.e., popular non-classical music since about 1940) than it is of modern classical.<p>You need to understand the conventions, and visually seeing &quot;difficult&quot; intervals is key to helping you write music that conforms to those norms.<p>In my opinion, modern standard notation is almost as good as a syntax highlighter in terms of seeing parallel 4ths, 5ths, octaves. It&#x27;s not quite as good, but it&#x27;s close.<p>The proposed redesign is . . . not so great at that.<p>6. Portability has been addressed by others, but I haven&#x27;t seen the scalability argument yet. Let&#x27;s say this works well for one person playing alone. What happens when you try to get 4 people to play together? What about 100? What about 1,000? Someone has to look at all of that and figure out what is supposed to be happening and then lead the group and know when things are going wrong. (I&#x27;ve conducted concerts with 8 harpsichords playing at a time. There is no way this style of notation would work.)<p>7. I just don&#x27;t think this is viable as a redesign of piano music. A learning aid? Maybe.",1436113882

9833971,comment,9831769,9832455,0,0,gaze,,,"I think just as much as it&#x27;s important to have intuition is to have a healthy relationship with your intuition. Knowing when to trust it and when not to. Intuition often happily leads you very far down the wrong path. Math can, too, obviously, but doing math properly involves many self checks. You frame the problem in many different ways and can see if they line up. Your intuition is just the way you see the world. If the way you see the world happens to be wrong, you&#x27;ll think the wrong thing. For instance, I might intuitively think that if I digitize a band limited analog signal I&#x27;m throwing something useful away... that you&#x27;re throwing away the data between the samples. There&#x27;s clearly wiggles there... those wiggles must encode something! It turns out though that a digitally sampled band limited signal can be perfectly reproduced. Perfectly. That&#x27;s totally counter-intuitive, by which I mean there&#x27;s little real world experience that would tell you otherwise!<p>So, I think you should think about intuition, math, whatever else you have in your pocket as tools. They give the right answer when used correctly and sometimes give the wrong answer even when you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;re using them correctly. I think though that intuition CAN be more insidious because it&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve experienced! It HAS to be true, you think.",1436113073

An attempt to justify why there are zero women listed (despite women making up 10-20%).<p><pre><code>  @csvan: Personally I don&#x27;t think gender matters at all
</code></pre>
Sure, you could interpret this either as a statement of not-yet-reached ideal or as a statement of eyes-closed naivity. Considering he opened with a rationalisation, a statement of assumed meritocracy, I chose the interpretation that fit. You chose the other one for some reason, which is fine.<p><pre><code>  @csvan: it is great to want to give exposure to minorities, but people 
  should be valued for their skill, not genitalia.
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s a common position, but dropping it into this discussion implies that positive discrimination is required in order to list any women on that page, that there are none who deserve to be there. Again, this chimes with my interpretation of &quot;I don&#x27;t think gender matters&quot;, not yours.<p><pre><code>  @WorldWideWayne: And he&#x27;s correct. And you agree with him. 
</code></pre>
The <i>only</i> thing he said that I agree with is that this is a male-dominated field, and even then, he&#x27;s implying that women are rare enough to have not produced anyone worthy of high profile. Which isn&#x27;t true.<p><pre><code>  @WorldWideWayne: Gender shouldn&#x27;t matter at all...
</code></pre>
Sure, when we get to that world we can have this conversation again. Back in reality, the playing field isn&#x27;t flat yet so any talk of meritocracy is based on false assumptions.<p><pre><code>  @WorldWideWayne: So, have a downvote. You deserve it.

Uh huh. For criticising his comments rather than holding hands in a prayer circle? For using a couple of rhetorical devices?<p>By your rules I&#x27;m pretty sure you should give yourself a downvote.<p>I wonder if you&#x27;d have gone on this rant is I hadn&#x27;t suggested @csvan &quot;level up&quot;.

I don't like systems that work this way, but I see the support/security tradeoff and it's a valid one.<p>Worth also knowing is that many ISP's store your password using reversible encryption, because if a customer calls up wanting to know their password, it doesn't have to be regenerated.

Judging from  the comparison gallery at <a href=""http://code.google.com/speed/webp/gallery.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/speed/webp/gallery.html</a>, it's not very impressing. The result is much more blocky and there is significant loss in detail in detail-concentrated areas.<p>Case in point: the first image of a landscape has two major noticeable artifacts: the shadow of the mountain (mid-right) reveals the blocky compression of WebP. Second, the compression algorithm tends to smooth out a lot of detail. Observe how the vegetation gets mushed out. The clouds as well (mostly on the top left).<p>Great for video, not so much for images (from the gallery above anyway). I would like to see a better comparison with WebP vs JPEG but compressed to about the same file size and with a RAW source (to remove any compression bias).",1306284973

But for a broader audience (I've read two of his books, if that matters) the supposed contradictions or hypocrisy aren't apparent. His 'sins' are presented, but the covenant being violated can only be guessed at. Even if it comes down to your own personal dashed expectations, elaborating on exactly what those were would make it easier to connect the dots in the way you intend.<p>As it is, it comes across as though there is something inherently wrong with him having what you think is a lot of money. Why should it matter? If you believe that a ""Foundation for Beautiful Evidence"" <i>should</i> exist, there must be reasons. But just going by the text that's there, it sounds like the main reason is that you think Tufte can afford to endow one. That may be a useful practical detail, if true, but it's not really a <i>reason</i> for him to do it. Remember: you're also asking him to do something with his time and attention, which he has no more of than you do. Why would he? Why would anybody? It might be understandable to someone who attended the course, but it could be elucidated to someone who hadn't by being direct about what you think such an enterprise could accomplish.",1306284967

Their spam tactics were the reason that facebook started changing their platform policies every month. Zynga took advantage of the fact that facebook at the time was not enforcing its app policies (remember forced invites?) so they maxed out their reach by using shady tricks and consistently breaking or bending the ToS. I remember me and other devs complaining to facebook for months and nothing was ever done. When facebook started limiting viral channels, zynga was already too big to be touched.<p>In the process, they destroyed many indie developers and the fear of being wiped by zynga is still everpresent. Personally, i find it hard to love anything about them, even after years. I 'm not jealous of them or their profits, but i find it hard to wish them ""good luck"". Maybe if they had started their own social gaming network i'd give them some credit.

Encrypting passwords and keeping the key in an offline (or hardware-protected), highly secure location helps manage your risk but ""don't ever do it"" should still be standard response when considering a system which lets you recover passwords.<p>I can think of two situations where design dictates you <i>need</i> passwords to be recoverable, but even though they exist you can (and I do :)) argue the design is wrong:<p>- Online aggregators like Mint/Yodlee/etc. that pass through your credentials and use screen scraping to get your data.

Even assuming they are encrypted with a strong key, anyone with access to the decryption key and the database can trivially recover any password stored by such a system.<p>Password hashes are not isomorphic to plaintext passwords, because there can be collisions.  That means there is no function to reliably take the stored passwords and turn them back into plaintext passwords; therefore, while reversing some/most passwords through complex iterative functions (e.g. brute force) is possible, the amount of work (particularly for bcrypt, pbkdf2, or other many-round hash+salt schemes) on average is many, many orders of magnitude greater than applying a decryption key.  For good passwords, the amount of work is not quite unbounded, but might as well be.<p>It's true that plaintext passwords and singly-hashed md5 passwords are both quite bad, but at least with the md5 hash nobody can (I think?) currently crack a 32 character random string since there are no rainbow tables for such long passwords.  (Assuming the password is vetted for common weaknesses, since ""random"" alone does not guarantee anything.  ""aaaaaaaa"" is a random 8 char password, after all.)  Functions that attempt to reverse non-isomorphic mappings end up being complex and, even in the case of rainbow tables for (unsalted) md5, are much slower than not having to recover the unencrypted password at all, or having some master key that decrypts all passwords.",1306282959

The restrictions Facebook places on viral marketing hurt everybody else and only put Zynga further ahead.<p>As for IP, the reason why Pincus is a shareholder in Facebook, along with Reid Hoffman, is because Facebook licensed social networking patents from him. He has been in the field for a long time, long before the mainstream press was hot on 'social', and he has significant IP holdings in the space, which are with Zynga.<p>The other companies you point out are now being prices in the same way music and movie studios are - ie. as hit-based businesses. Gaming budgets have become so large, and so much of it is tie-ins and licensing, that for each of these companies it is one or two big hits or franchises plus dozens of big misses. They are all big, large and inefficient companies - again, no different to the music and movie studios.<p>The only one of the three performing well is Activision, and that is mostly because of the recurring revenue from the Blizzard merger. Prior to that they were also in a lot of trouble (at the time of the merger they were worth $18B, now $12B). EA has been bleeding money for years and unsure what to do - even their big old hits such as Guitar Hero and the FIFA franchise are costing them money. Take-Two hasn't made a profit in 3 of the past 4 years, and is currently valued at less than the revenue it receives from a single release of GTA - so the market has no confidence in them at all.<p>It is actually the traditional gaming houses who are having trouble producing constant hits. If Activision lost World of Warcraft tomorrow they would be in a world of trouble. EA and Take-Two already are. The virtual goods market is showing no signs of slowing down, $2B last year and growing at 50%+. This is as big a shift in the gaming market as arcades to consoles was, with EA being the only one of the three making a decent effort in the new market (4th largest, but almost 10 times smaller than Zynga)<p>Zynga, which represents the 'new model' is over 1,000 employees (vs 7,600, 7,600 and 2202 respectively) and near $2B this year in revenue (vs 4.47B, 3.5B and 0.7B respectively), and while there is a chance that their valuation will enter over-blown territory, there is little doubt that they are absolutely killing the old gaming companies atm. It might not be Zynga that is #1 in 10 years time, but it will be somebody - and atm nobody is even challenging Zynga in this space - but you seem to be arguing against a shift that is by all accounts very real.<p>Edit: and on the issue of Hold'em - with the government shutting down the online poker sites in the USA it has seen a spike in play, which means it will be in a very good position if UEGA is repealed or if poker is found by a court decision to not be gambling.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.appdata.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appdata.com/</a>",1306282622

2582272,comment,2580383,2582097,5,0,akeefer,,,"Sure . . . I mean, C doesn't exactly have namespaces, and neither did PHP at first, and you can write code in them, so it's not that it's somehow not possible to uniquely name functions.  But it's pretty annoying, and I'd say that many people who are used to modules and namespaces miss them when they move to a world that doesn't have those things.  They exist as A) syntactic sugar, so that you can just say assign_user_activity() instead of my_company_my_project_assign_user_activity and B) as a strong organizing principle (potentially that has tooling around it).  The former point is just annoying; my argument was that the latter is really the point of modules or namespaces.<p>Maybe I want to find all the functions related to assignment:  how do I do that?  Do I just look on disk?  Do I use tags or metadata?  Do I assume some naming convention?  It's a problem you have to solve somehow, and solving it requires effort, because it's an explicit organizational effort.  Modules or namespaces or packages or classes give you a way to say ""this stuff goes together"" and to encapsulate and abstract large units of related functionality, and to do so in a way that tools and programs understand.  In a Java IDE, my IDE will auto-complete all the functions on a class; in a REPL I can just print out all the methods on an object.  That's a useful organizing principle, and it's one that you lose if you totally flatten the namespace.<p>You could argue that organization isn't one-dimensional or hierarchical, which is what namespaces and such force on you, and it's a reasonable statement.  But replacing it with nothing explicit and relying on extensive developer metadata and documentation so you can search for things?  That seems even more idealistic.  When was the last time you saw every single function, even private ones, documented and tagged so correctly and up-to-date on a real-world, large-scale project that you'd rely on them to serve as the only organizing principle in your application?",1306281973

A user should only be able to obliterate their `$HOME` folder and nothing else, and if you run npm as a certain user, you can restrict that even further by setting the right permissions. If you still need further protection from accidental deletions, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to use a filesystem with snapshot support like ZFS or BTRFS.<p>Very few programs should be run as root, and developers <i>should</i> know this. Random scripts pulled from the internet are not in that list. If you absolutely need to be logged in as root, then it&#x27;s probably best you run npm as a different user (runuser -l username -c command). I cannot imagine any reason why you would need to run `npm install` as root. Global packages? Perhaps users should chmod their global npm modules folder to allow installing as an unprivileged user, or at least as the npm user, and then run npm as that user. My global npm packages folder is owned by the npm user/group and if I need to install a global npm package, i usually run it as `runuser -l npm -c npm install -g ...` (or sudo -u npm on osx). It&#x27;s not an extreme precaution and it&#x27;s not even a hassle, and while I understand it&#x27;s not the default, it&#x27;s also not true that by default npm install can write or delete files outside of your home folder (unless run as root)<p>I&#x27;m not sure the title of this should be &quot;npm install could be dangerous&quot; more than &quot;running scripts as root could be very dangerous&quot;, which is a no-brainer. The rule of thumb for users/admins in unix-like systems is to keep permissions as strict as possible.",1422308982

Personally I&#x27;d prefer it be a lot simpler and purposeful than Python.  (Perhaps Z or UML?)

Second, the beneficiary is not drawing on the account for living expenses.<p>If you can put $10 in an account at 3% interest and wait 200 years, you can take $3693.56 out.  The key is not needing that money at all over a 200 year time span.  The interest only accumulates on money that stays in the account.<p>Rich folks can afford to let money sit and gather interest.  Poor folks spend all that they earn, if not more.<p>As a thought experiment, take two identical trust funds.  Put $10M in one, and $20M in the other.  Both grow at 4% per year.  At the end of each year, the beneficiaries may withdraw up to 3% of the fund.  The beneficiaries have similar tastes, and initially withdraw $250k.  Each subsequent year, they draw 3% more, unless they hit the cap.<p>How many years before the larger fund grows from double to triple the size of the smaller?  25.  It is four times the size after 42 years.  It is 10x the size after 112 years.  It takes 14 years for the less endowed beneficiary to hit the withdrawal cap, and 128 years for the other to reach it, at 10.64 times the size, spending 10.64 times as much per year, forevermore.<p>If your expenses grow more slowly than your investments, you will grow ever richer.

The result is that journal articles (even in those in single-author fields) often sound like they were written by a hive mind rather than an individual.<p>I was actually intending to do graduate work in archaeology but switched to history when I realized how dreary the prose style favored by archaeologists was. At least history has a few authors with an engaging and original style (for instance, Simon Schama, Fernand Braudel, and Natalie Zemon Davis).

A car has (at the simplified level) a single wheel that goes either left or right and 3 pedals. The hardest concept relating to hardware is what a gear is and why you need to shift it (among a few others).<p>It is correct though that software CAN be more simple than that in their use. Those pieces of software tend not to solve complex or any problems in our real world though.<p>When it comes to &#x27;coding as literacy&#x27; this has not much to do with using a highly simplified UI. It has to do with the fact that if I want to use most of the features of the machine we call PC, you HAVE to be able to program.<p>Sticking with the car analogy my kid can have great fun if I show her how to use the horn in the car. It will not allow her to do anything meaningful with the car (getting from A to B). All she can do is use the car as a toy.<p>I agree with you on the core problem though. Things are abstraced away from everyone in our daily lives in such a way, that people sometimes are unable to be &#x27;precise&#x27;.

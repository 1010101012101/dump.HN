17228,comment,16972,17168,0,0,jey,,,"I don't dispute that, but the point is that at that point it's just a matter of <i>doing it</i>. You start writing code, encounter problems, find solutions. If implementation is really so hard and ideas are so cheap, you should be trying to implement dozens of ideas and giving up because of the technical challenges for each site you're actually able to launch. For me it's the converse, I have a harder time finding a good idea worth doing than doing the implementation and refinement. Yes, refining the idea and doing it right are non-trivial, but that's got more to do with how competent you are in general. I personally don't have a glut of good ideas and a shortage of implementation skill. Yes, I can come up with ideas if we just want to measure by volume -- but these have to survive through the ""Is this a good idea?"" filter before I count it as an actual idea. Generating crap is easy.",1177631420

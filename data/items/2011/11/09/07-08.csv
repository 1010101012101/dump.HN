I slept inconsistently for 15 years and, after ~1 year of reprogramming the habit, have been able to get consistently good sleep. The productivity boost has been phenomenal since then and it has been absolutely worthwhile.<p>My most important habits are:<p>1) <i>Sleep when tired at night</i> - sounds obvious but you'd be shocked at how often we fight it. Don't nap. Just get to the evening and sleep early if you need to.<p>2) <i>Wake up and get out of bed at the same time everyday</i> - get your body in a pattern. This is critical. If you consider staying in bed once you wake up, you will fall asleep and train yourself to roll around in the morning. If you force yourself up and start moving, you'll be wide awake in a few minutes. One week of this the habit will begin to form. Avoid alcohol and late nights to get this habit rolling.<p>3) <i>Do the same thing every night before you sleep</i> -condition your body to expect sleep. Reading fiction for 15 minutes has been a good tool for me (avoid tasks like checking email that keep your mind active, the whole point is to ease into sleep!)<p>Be wary of polyphasic sleep! I tried this and the first week resulted in massive sleep deprivation that took a heavy toll on productivity (serious IQ and attention span dip. zombies are stupid) and ended with a massive crash and hibernate period.<p>You're right to think about sleep. If you can get this down, you'll be much more productive.

11035766,comment,11034071,11035198,0,0,mbrock,,,"I think we&#x27;re heading for a synthesis of these opposing trends, the common core being a fatigue with complex bloated user interfaces, and a return to simpler design. Personally I enjoy command line interfaces, especially in full screen with huge fonts, and I&#x27;ve been using Ratpoison (one of the first tiling X window managers) like this since like 2004. But I also enjoy, at least in principle, tablet-style UIs. Neither is based on overlapping windows, for one thing, and they are both helpful for my quasi-ADHD/OCD tendencies.<p>Mac OS now is in a weird limbo between the Unix heritage, the Mac heritage, and the iOS heritage. I think unifying these strands is an enormous challenge, but also really cool and inspiring. Maybe Apple are going to focus on making cars or whatever, and some weird little upstart is going to come along and make something totally new. You can see people starting to talk about Slack as an operating system, but that&#x27;s still very primitive.<p>Chat and command lines are interesting because they represent a huge paradigm that&#x27;s been overshadowed by the &quot;GUI&quot; paradigm, namely the paradigm of queries and responses: you ask the computer something and get something back, perhaps asynchronously. It&#x27;s such a useful, coherent model. Easy to program with. Portable across interfaces. Good for exploration. Cognitively appropriate. Etc etc.<p>I think the complexity and bug-riddenness of most &quot;modern&quot; desktop operating systems come from an over-complicated and incoherent model of operation. Mobile represents a new start. It currently lacks in flexibility, but it&#x27;s probably a good thing to start with rigid simplicity than to try for flexible complexity, and unless you can perfect a genius UI right away I do think those are the options, if you&#x27;re aiming for the general public who don&#x27;t want to learn vim.<p>I also think the divide between application programmers and computer users is politically a Bad Thing and also a result of exaggerated complexity. Unix was always about user scripting, and it managed that because of textual data, worse-is-better, and RTFM. Apple might not be the company to get back to this, because they&#x27;re making tons of money from making shiny coherent appliances for people who pay to think as little as possible.<p>So just generally I&#x27;m not holding my breath for Apple to come up with a wildly new and interesting paradigm here. They&#x27;re a dinosaur. A very pretty dinosaur. I&#x27;m more interested in startups with weird ideas, like maybe let&#x27;s use e-ink displays, cheap ultralight computers, cloud servers, natural language processing,  and the interactive fiction adventure exploration paradigm to provide a new style of terminal gadget that&#x27;s even cooler than Linux.

There is plenty of software that has been immune to it (think everyday developer tools, command line stuff, etc). Often the apps with the least amount of feature creep are the ones where they are bounded by the APIs they talk to, i.e. if the API (which they don&#x27;t control) is static, they can&#x27;t really add any more features.<p>Outside of software, we see a similar thing, a wrench (or spanner) hasn&#x27;t gotten many new features, because the bolt that it turns isn&#x27;t changing. the goal is roughly the same. The only appreciable changes have been in ergonomics, and even these are effectively static.<p>On the other hand, we have cars, which are suffering from so much feature creep it is unbelievable. every year, car engines get a little bit more efficient, but they also get heavier, bloated with more systems, infotainment, seat adjustments, window adjustments, etc.As a result, the efficiency of the improved powertrain seldom makes appreciable performance difference. (yes, there are outliers).<p>Cars then, might be the equivalent of &quot;the ultimate app&quot; which does everything for you, but loses sight of its purpose. Meanwhile, we have a long history of leaving single tools alone, and they tend to work great.<p>The trouble is that in the world of physical tools, the workflow changes/context switching between using one tool and then another is easy. Meanwhile, in software, feature creep ends up being the solution for poor context switching between apps. In an ideal world, working on an image in photoshop and then pixelmator, and then illustrator, and then publishing to wordpress would be as seamless as using a wrench, then a screwdriver, and then cleaning things up with a rag. Unfortunately, software interface constraints almost necessitate feature creep as the &quot;simplest&quot; way to add functionality, even when convoluted menus, hotkeys, and naming conventions obscure utility.",1454607386

Devs porting over apps to linux and users not having some of their favourite apps available.<p>It&#x27;s becoming clear that Apple is not paying enough attention to the under the hood details of an OS and the security situation. And maintaining the OS is a huge investment from Apple. So it only feels natural to base Mac OS on linux and, as I said earlier, focus on the distinguishing features.<p>Technically though, it would still be a huge challenge as there are lots of factors to consider,but in the long term everyone wins Apple,linux though maybe not Microsoft.<p>I have been thinking about this idea of Apple using linux instead of its proprietary Mac OS for a long time, and have considered the transition only at a very high level. I would like to hear what the HN community thinks of this idea.<p>Edit: So instead of forking a version of linux and developing it independantly like what Apple did previously, a better model might be where Apple periodically forks from upstream projects and makes its modifications. Something like what Linux mint does with Ubuntu. So this way, they continue to get the latest and greatest developments from upstream projects without investing additional resources into maintaining their forked OS(this is currently what is happening with Mac OS).",1454606829

Multiphoton ionization has simply <i>never been observed to happen except under extremely intense (read: it&#x27;ll melt you)</i> fields and there are strong theoretical reasons to believe it won&#x27;t happen.&quot;<p>He we go again. The assumption that microwaves won&#x27;t have biological effects because it would have to be at a melt you level. Or focusing on one aspect where this might be true. That&#x27;s despite plenty of work in the past showing otherwise. Example:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect</a><p>Did Frey&#x27;s subjects all die? No? QED.<p>Now, since microwaves can affect us, what effects do they have and how? This piece of research claims one. So, the question becomes: is it producing good data from good methodology? If so, then we duplicate that data from a few groups unlikely to collude to forge it. If it checks out, especially eliminating other variables, then cell radiation is probably killing sperm and we find out why.<p>&quot;if this effect is real, it&#x27;ll require new physics to explain.&quot;<p>Another common line of nonsense dropped often when people push the envelope in science. Most of the time, we find that existing physics explains a new phenomenon but scientists were just looking at the problem wrong.

Use what works for you and learn what you care about learning.<p>When a new JS library comes out, don&#x27;t groan, take a quick peek and decide if it&#x27;s worth it to try to integrate it into your workflow. I think it&#x27;s great to have options and the options in web development are seemingly neverending.

It&#x27;s just that Apple&#x27;s enormously successful &quot;It just works&quot; marketing message from 20006-2009 continues to doggedly trot out with its fans today, so Apple gets tarred with the same bar to clear today despite an enormously more complex operating environment since then.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help all the review channels (magazines, newspapers, blogs, vblogs, videos, <i>etc.</i>) focus their attention exclusively upon new features in a new release. You need someone as persuasive as Jobs to pull off convincing those channels to review refinements to add stability as new features. The people Apple has put forward to hopefully capture that role hasn&#x27;t resonated with the public yet.<p>But software QA should never be an episodic, herculean, release-bound effort. There are ways to market it positively, but I&#x27;d always rather use the finite PR time surrounding a release marketing and selling the quantum leaps that set me apart from the competition, not the incremental steps.<p>In the age of Big Data, instrumented apps and online-inline updates delivery, a possible initial pass at identifying problem areas to shore up that is actually hitting people in their daily workflows is to simply track on the search engines the popularity of complaints about major bundled applications, subsystems and components. An OS X release should not, for example, let the first-page results for Contacts be about entries disappearing [1], three updates into its lifecycle.<p>There is still plenty of space for innovation here, I think. There are auto crash reports, but no systematic, automated means for a publisher like Apple to send targeted offers to users sending crash reports that pass a specified threshhold (number of crashes, kind of hardware, stack trace pattern, <i>etc.</i>) to update their app to an instrumented one that give developers not just the results of instrumenting the one or a handful of users who happen to persist enough through the now-familiar troubleshooting dance, but hundreds or even thousands of users at the same time, opening up opportunities to automatically search for commonalities and assist with the manual troubleshooting.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=mac+contacts+%22el+capitan%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=mac+contacts+%22el+capitan%2...</a>",1454605903

11035321,comment,10992232,11013264,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Sorry, but I&#x27;m not going to get into any specifics about the CAD systems. I have seen first-hand (though fortunately as a third party) what happened when someone upset the wrong big name in that industry, and I have no interest in either spending the next part of my life defending a frivolous lawsuit supposedly necessary to protect their reputation nor in having licences tied to me revoked under blatantly abusive EULA terms. I will say that your assumption was wrong, though; it was not AutoCAD that I was referring to.<p>As for the Adobe issue, as I see it the point is that the original product was known to be faulty, and a means of correcting the defect was already made. Given the cost and expected useful lifetime of the original software, and given the relatively small and presumably diminishing-over-time cost of maintaining an update server relative to that, I have no problem in this sort of case with literally requiring perpetual availability of the existing updates for as long as the developer is around and it is commercially viable to do so. I don&#x27;t think this is a universally appropriate solution, but for the kind of software we&#x27;re talking about that makes many millions or billions in revenues, it doesn&#x27;t seem at all unreasonable to me. If the software developer doesn&#x27;t like it, they are free not to incorporate artificially limited technology in their product in the first place, for example by distributing updates in a freely downloadable form instead of via a proprietary system with limited availability.<p>Incidentally, if a software product really has no remaining value after just 6 years, the developers are welcome to relinquish the relevant copyright as well since clearly it also has no remaining value at that point, and then anyone else who is willing and able to solve any future problems with that software can lawfully do so. Perhaps the law should no longer give the developers a choice, by including a specific exemption to copyright for actions reasonably necessary to allow the continued effective operation of the software according to the original deal. In this case, that might extend up to and including installing a cracked pirate version instead, provided that the use would otherwise have been lawful.<p>As you say, I suspect in the near future a lot of these big software developers are going to try to bypass these issues entirely by moving everyone onto subscription models anyway. I don&#x27;t expect that strategy to remain a viable exclusive proposition in the longer term, though, because it&#x27;s too hostile to users. In most cases, it will naturally create opportunities for less hostile alternatives in the market, as we&#x27;re already seeing with the increasing competition faced by Adobe Creative Cloud from smaller, cheaper, but still professional-quality and well-regarded alternatives in various niches.",1454605410

Scarcity isn&#x27;t just a question of production, but also one of consumption. With some goods (e.g. food), we could reach a point where the entire population of the world cannot consume more.

In two weeks, you discovered the wrong thing.<p>Maybe I didn&#x27;t describe it very well. 12 days was perhaps a poor choice because it is convenient to a sprint cycle, but in my comment it was meant to function as a random placeholder.<p>This type of work happens like Poisson shocks, or like lightning strikes. You work and work and it seems like you don&#x27;t get a single thing done, zero story points completed, etc., and then boom, in one fell swoop you figure out a huge advancement in the problem. That&#x27;s the defining aspect of the work I am talking about. The burndown graphs will look like (and <i>should</i> look like) a flat line that suddenly drops to zero near the end.<p>It has nothing to do with &quot;failing fast&quot; because it&#x27;s not &quot;failing.&quot; It is the process of discovering what the actual problem is. This is very different than a situation where you, say, try out a MVC architecture but later realize it&#x27;s not optimal for a business use case and need to change it to MVVM or something. You can <i>always</i> make measured progress on the first attempt, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, that would constitute valuable failure-case knowledge.<p>But with more abstract questions it&#x27;s more like you are saying this: we tried to solve it, and we are not even sure whether or not we&#x27;ve made any progress yet, and we won&#x27;t be sure until right at the moment we&#x27;ve either solved the problem completely or demonstrated why our whole approach cannot be used to solve it.<p>That&#x27;s perhaps a very idealized version; most problems don&#x27;t fall that far on the research spectrum. But the point is that many problems still do fall <i>pretty far</i> on that spectrum, and if you set up your approach to them based on doing Step A then doing Step B then reporting about metric C, etc., it actually <i>hinders</i> your ability to solve it, since the very nature of the problem is not amenable to that sort of thing.",1454605388

If cheap labor were unavailable, wages and prices would both rise and the business owners would end up about the same.<p>The situation is somewhat complicated by the seasonal nature of the work, which means yearly cycles of hiring and firing. We normally associate periods of intense hiring with a shortage (ie, a recent shift in the economy means much more demand for some category of worker and not enough people have been trained yet to fill the demand), but in the case of agricultural work, that&#x27;s part of the economy in steady-state.",1454605347

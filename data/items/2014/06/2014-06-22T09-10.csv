If they collected your medical information from your doctor&#x27;s office to then blackmail you with it, that is not a privacy issue because they could also have come to your door and asked you about your medical history, and that would also be unacceptable, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>If I understand your argument right, it is roughly &quot;if &#x27;they&#x27; can do something bad in more than one way, then either of the ways is not bad because it would still be bad if the other way was used&quot;? I&#x27;m not quite sure how to make sense of that.<p>Also, one anecdote from history: The nazis when they invaded the Netherlands used existing census information on religious affiliation that was easily available on hollerith punch cards to find and deport the jews. Would you say that that information collection was not a threat for the jews who probably got killed faster and in larger numbers than if the data had not been available in that form?<p>edit: One more example to consider: A dictator is not a threat, if he doesn&#x27;t do anything that would still be inacceptable if it was done by a democracy. Well, a dictator is a threat exactly because you don&#x27;t know that, and we tend to prefer democracy in order to protect ourselves from that risk of having a dictator of the bad kind.",1403430699

Fire/EMS, STEM, Kids, you name it, if it&#x27;s a cause that I support, I&#x27;ll generally be there with a bell if I&#x27;ve got the free time.  One of my non profits that I do a fair amount of technical and &#x27;feel-good&#x27; work is a foundation that caters to small children who have terminal or other serious illnesses and helps their family out.<p>One night in 2013, a rather distraught woman came in saying that Children&#x27;s had placed a lien on her home because of the unpaid medical bills;  apparently, they had moved, civil service sucks in Ohio, and had a default judgement against them.  New collections company comes in, finds this family, and then places a lien on her homes, car, and gets a court order to garnish their bank account.<p>Ultimately, it took a pro-bono attorney about 80 hours to get the entire mess cleaned up.  Today, the little guy is almost 4 and the family has a clean title on their home and car, and as long as she keeps less than $2K in her checking account at all times and only has the one home and one car, Children&#x27;s will never come after her for the money that is owed, and in 3 years, they&#x27;ll wipe away the debt.",1403428498

To use an extreme example, say there is an advocacy organization which the government decides they don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;ll use the ACLU just as an arbitrary familiar example. They could use their postal database to find all the people that have written letters to the ACLU, and target them in some way. It could be something extreme, like throwing them all in jail, or something more subtle, like using the IRS to  audit them. Now, I think we can agree that this action is unacceptable. But the thing is, this action would still be unacceptable even if they didn&#x27;t have or use the database. If they simply sent a government official to your house, asked you if you were involved with the ACLU, and arrested you if you said yes, that would clearly not be a violation of privacy, but it would clearly be unacceptable.<p>So I don&#x27;t really see the scanning of the outside faces of letters to be a privacy issue.

Instead, this article just leaps ahead with a blind-faith &#x27;we must do this!&#x27; attitude.<p>That&#x27;s great if you are just toying with this sort of thing for fun, but perhaps worthless if you are advocating a style of server design for others.<p>Also, the decade-ago 10k problem could draw some interesting parallels. First of all, are machines today 1000 times faster? If they are, then even if you hit the 10M magic number, you will still only be able to do the same amount of work per-connection that you could have done 10 years ago. I am guessing that many internet services are much more complicated than a decade ago...<p>And if you can achieve 10M connections per server, you really should be asking yourself whether you actually want to. Why not split it down to 1M each over 10 servers? No need for insane high-end machines, and the failover when a single machine dies is much less painful. You&#x27;ll likely get a much improved latency per-connection as well.",1392623662

That is, over plain http. Over TLS this goes down to about 100 connections and 600 requests/s. A cheap amazon instance will usually be around 1/5th of all that.<p>With a bit of tweaking you can get the plain http case a bit higher, but the TLS route will not get much better, because TLS isn&#x27;t written with speed in mind (the handshake is slow and expensive) and the prevalent implementation (OpenSSL) is not written for high performance servers (it basically dictates that you run blocking sockets in a thread per connection).<p>Unfortunately spdy and various http2 proposals rely on TLS (in order to punch trough proxies), which means going back in server performance about 10 years.<p>So it is of little surprise that companies have started offering &quot;cloud&quot; solutions, because the typical VPS can&#x27;t handle todays high traffic internet over TLS (worse than plain http by a factor of 10) and the typical cloud server is worse than a VPS by a factor 5, creating a 50x performance degradation, artificially. Obviously when faced with the question of running 10 servers, or 100, most small companies turn to the even worse &quot;cloud&quot; solution, requiring even more servers (500).<p>The whole affair is a sodding mess, and we&#x27;re wasting massive amounts of energy and capital on insisting on doing things inefficiently. This is because by rights our VPS servers should easily be able to break trough the 10k limit in every way, but it can&#x27;t because the OS wastes a lot of time running an inefficient network stack as well as that TLS and OpenSSL can&#x27;t be bothered to get their act together.<p>And that is how, in the year of our lord 2014, more than 15 years after somebody writing the 10k problem article, and after webservers becoming at least 128x faster then back in the 90ties, most websites out there can still not stand up to serious traffic, take ages to load, and are hosted by an infrastructure (routers and whatnot) that easily buckle under even light DDOSing.",1392620616

The American tradition was to use engineering tolerances that would maximize throughput under the constraint that it produced a pretty functional car. The Japanese tradition on the other hand was to use tighter tolerances, well because there was room for tightening the tolerance. At the surface level, or the MBA level it seems that the Japanese way is just dumb. It does not make monetary sense when measured in sales per year. But it turns out that the benefits express themselves at a different timescale: better brand and a culture of devotion to improvement, rather than to being &quot;just good enough to work so that I can move to the next thing&quot;.<p>Part of this applies to the craft of software too. One can be sloppy and churn out functional websites by the dozens. At the superficial level, the goal to extract the most from a 500MHX Pentium-III might seem brain dead, with little or no pay off. But it pays back by instilling an attitude of deeply learning your craft, that learning does pay back although that specific well tuned web server might not. You dont have to build all your servers that way, but if it doesnt hurt you a little when you know exactly what you could have done to extract some more juice out of it, you will not reach that level of understanding. If you are impatient or sloppy, you will build impatience into your product, and it will show.<p>Besides it is always easy to over value ones time, it sometimes correlates with conceit.<p>@sitkack what makes you think I was talking about the 50s.

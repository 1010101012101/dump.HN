Wouldn't the fall in demand lead to a corresponding drop in investment in automation?

4915064,comment,4914217,4914860,3,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"The real issue on the employment front is that we humans imagined job automation <i>backwards</i> from how it's really happening.<p>We assumed that jobs would be automated from ""menial"" to ""advanced"".  First would go lots of farm labor, then manual servants, then eventually factory workers, and by the time it reached educated, white-collar middle-class folks, the world would hit post-scarcity and we'd all become artists and writers and scientists.<p>Instead, it has ended up proceeding: farm labor, a minority of manual servants, some but not all factory workers, and finally <i>most</i> white-collar middle class jobs.  The white-collar middle-class jobs were the <i>brain jobs</i>, were <i>always</i> based on the manipulation of data, and therefore turned out more amenable to encoding in software than almost anything else.<p>So the future is looking more and more like this: a sizable but weakly employed class of menial factory/physical laborers for the physical things too customized to automate, a smaller ""middle class"" to actually run specialized machinery (machinery whose operation requires knowledge of what it does rather than knowledge of ""how to use Windows XP""), a small elite of upper-middle class innovators with hyper-advanced knowledge and hyper-competitive lifestyles (Hacker News, this is <i>your</i> future), and the capitalist class itself.<p>What replaces the standard-issue job for common people?  Nothing.  In its place, we have a mass of unemployed people where the old class of mid-skilled blue and white collar workers used to be.  Any time a piece of work would require employing massive numbers of manual workers, it becomes amenable to specialized, programmatic automation.  Unemployment will become a fact of life as common as we currently consider, say, not owning land.",1355391475

The stodgy traditional industry chugs on because it serves as a quality stamp. I don't mean to just cite anecdotal experience but it's pretty clear to me that the majority of self-published 'journalism' is simply not up to the level of say, The Economist, and I know that the Amazon self-published scene is full of both unreadable, horribly formatted, typo-heavy books and straight up nutjobs, which doesn't happen too often in the big six. Another way of saying this, if I haven't gotten the point across, is that publishers DO find journalists and manage logistics for journalists. They also give them a soapbox that has a big stamp on it that reads, 'trust us, she's a great writer. All this stuff is true.' So yes, I do fear a world in which anyone can become a 'journalist.'",1355391152

For searching. Google Maps has a much better autocomplete all round. Faster, more readable and elegant. Once you have selected an entry then Apple Maps jumps straight there. Google Maps does a handy move animation showing me the relative location, although it slows things down a litte.  I LOVE this feature.
For panning. Apple Maps is equivalent to Google Maps.  Apple Maps has a fade in transition for loaded tiles which is a nice touch.
For POIs. Apple Maps is showing me a few POIs - often in the wrong place. Google Maps is showing me all key POIs in exactly the right place.  Google Maps is the first mapping product to get my home address correct (TomTom, Navigon, Garmin, Apple).<p>For UI. Google Maps has a nicer UI. Apple Maps requires you to click on a small button which goes to a separate screen with more options. I really like the sidebar that Google implemented.<p>Overall. Google Maps has much better street data and nicer UI. Apple Maps had a smooth UI, showed POIs in the wrong spot here in Australia.<p>I think the competition is great.  Looking forward to seeing if Apple can lift their socks on the next incarnation of Maps - they have a LONG way to go.",1355390993

The fundamental problem is that NASA is averse to iterative and competitive development styles, which is absolutely necessary in this case.<p>As a case in point, look at the JWST, which will end up costing around $10 billion (more than 1,000% over budget) and over a decade behind schedule. The TPF is easily an order of magnitude more technologically challenging than JWST and would require putting 4x as much hardware into space. If it were managed the same way as JWST it would end up costing perhaps $100 billion and not launching until 2030 or later.",1355389560

It turns out scaling horizontally gets you a lot, too. You might be able to scale horizontally more efficiently if you had a bunch of brains-in-vats that are telepathically linked into some sort of hive mind, but probably only by constant factors.<p>We can also self-modify within certain limited parameters (learning, drugs, etc.), but that's the most any intelligence can do.

It's much harder to get 300 people to shut off their devices in a hurry, especially when some have tucked their devices in the seatback pocket and gone to sleep.<p>Second, it seems entire plausible to my (non-electrical-engineer) mind that 300 devices of a large variety of makes are more likely to cause interference than just one or two, both for the combined signal and the chance that one will be badly designed.<p>I used to be indignant about the PED rule as well.

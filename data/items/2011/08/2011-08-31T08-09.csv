It seems either you've got a very wide variety of custom graphics elements, or only a few elements and have to draw a very wide number of images to fit in them.<p>Each two digits of hex is 255, and I count 16 pairs, but can think of only 8 elements in the photos (eyes, ears, nose, mouth, head, body, arms, background).<p>If it's those 8 elements and they're derived from four digits in the hash, then you need 65,535 or so different ears.<p>I'm guessing the solution to this is to reduce the hash further... so you get more repetition where two texts produce the same robot, but apparently they've not made it too bad.<p>How far did robohash reduce it?

(They have the same session every year, but as WWDC has grown it has shifted a bit to be more... useful for the masses.)  It will be called ""Designing iPhone Apps"" or maybe ""building great user interfaces"" or something like that.<p>They go thru Apple's process for product development in some very useful detail.  I won't try to relate it because I'll get it wrong, or get phases out of order, but the short answer to your question is they design the product, then work on the technology to bring it to life.<p>I think this session is probably the most revealing Apple has ever been about their ""secret sauce"".  It isn't really proprietary, but they apply it all the time, and to every single product.<p>I think much of the Steve Jobs mystique comes from Apple simply embedding this practice into their methodology... and they reveal it plainly in at least the 2008 WWDC video (though I think it gets more obscure in later years.)<p>The 2008 one to watch is Session 351: iPhone Application User Interface Design.<p>That one session was worth the entire amount of money I paid  to go to the conference.",1314780464

There are so many projects at Google that it is hard to see a coherent vision for the future.<p>Of course the difference between Google/Microsoft and Apple in 1997 is that Apple didn't have a profitable core business (Windows and Office for Microsoft, Adwords for Google). Google and Microsoft can afford to spread out, but Apple's only chance in 1997 was to focus.<p>It's also interesting to note that in their early days, both Microsoft and Google were very focussed.

2944799,comment,2944579,2944741,26,0,nirvana,,,"I went to several WWDCs that had these Q&A sessions, and pretty quickly I stopped going to them.  The problem was that the questions were usually very poor, and even when the questioner was asking something that I wanted to know the answer to, I already knew the answer: Either the person on stage didn't know the answer, or couldn't give it, or it was an issue that hadn't yet been decided and so there was no answer.<p>Many of the ""questions"" were more expressions of someone's opinion, and almost always these opinions disagreed with the direction Apple was going (otherwise you'd have no reason to complain, naturally) and in every case I can think of, I remember there being evidence that Apple had already considered the perspective of the person complaining.<p>Apple goes its own way, and of course some people are not going to like it.  Many people who don't like it before the fact, do like it after the fact-- remember the derision the iPad and iPhone got between when they were announced and when they shipped?<p>These Q&A sessions did, however, make it pretty clear to me that Apple is both aware of people's issues, considerate of them, and revealing as much as it can in the normal course of events at WWDC.<p>Further, I don't think they provided Apple with the feedback they were looking for, and Apple has instead shifted towards establishing relationships with people in the relevant industries and the developer community and keeps in touch with them directly.<p>I think Apple gets a lot of the good feedback at WWDC from the labs.   It used to be, when WWDC was smaller, you could develop relationships with Apple employees at the beer bust and thursday party.  But now, I think it is the labs, and the labs provide a time where both parities can dig into the details of the issue, hopefully with code, and figure out the right solution.   Also, when labs are use to educate newbies to a technology, the questions they ask is a strong form of feedback.<p>So, I think Apple is getting the feedback from the community, even more now than it did then.  It has just found better ways to do it.",1314779623

This is not a rule of How Writing Should Be Done, it's just an exercise, the same way that avoiding goto is an important exercise for novice programmers.  I'm sure you could think of other options, like making each paragraph be comprised of one long sentence, or taking a second pass to your work and compressing it into as few words as possible, or picking a small set of words and abusively trying to work them in as much as possible.

Primarily I see housing as a necessity rather than a financial opportunity.<p>This is the opposite of what most English people seem to value, and vote in policies for.  Is there any other country where property is treated so much as an investment?<p>This[1] system is a good way to have reasonable rent, essentially a housing association.  But housing associations in England are only for poor people; not the case in other European countries like Germany and Scandinavia.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11032936"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11032936</a>",1454605196

This is fairly stupid, considering that Ubuntu&#x27;s marketshare was pretty much 100% PC, 0% tablets. They gave their main demographic a slap in the face, and they never really did acquire any tablet market. Now, according to DistroWatch, Ubuntu is below Mint and Debian in terms of popularity.<p>There&#x27;s something to be said about reinventing the wheel just for the sake of reinventing it, change for the sake of change. Constantly redesigning UIs that were working perfectly well, chasing after fads. In implementing a new UI, Ubuntu acquired a lot of new bugs, broken features and reliability issues. That&#x27;s normal. Newer code is buggier code. You might think this &quot;old&quot; code is crufty, it might not be designed in the ideal way you like, but by throwing it away, you throw away years of testing and fixes too. That&#x27;s an argument in favor of incremental evolution and refactorings IMO.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m biased. When I was 16, I used to find colorful desktop backgrounds and fancy UIs cool. Now I&#x27;m 30, and I just want the damn thing to f&#x27;ing work reliably. I don&#x27;t need rounded corners, or transparency, or animations or even a desktop background. I&#x27;d be OK with a bland UI that looks like Windows 98, so long as the machine can do all I need it to reliably and fast.",1454605174

But it&#x27;s so hypocritical, because most of the times I see these ads, it&#x27;s from Google&#x27;s network!<p>I&#x27;m not happy that they punish the publisher/webmaster with no accountability for the advertiser or ad network. I can use Google&#x27;s AdSense on my website, and unless I continually make an effort to manually review ads, it&#x27;s very likely it will begin display these sorts of ads. And then because AdSense doesn&#x27;t care, Chrome will begin flagging my website as malicious to users?!?<p>I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;re not doing this as well as making an effort to purge these sorts of ads from AdSense. That way, I could feel comfortable that my users aren&#x27;t being shown scummy ads, which would be a huge advantage over other ad networks. Now instead, running ads on a website will either become a liability, or an extra added effort to make sure I don&#x27;t get screwed over by Google.<p>Also, while a noble goal, there&#x27;s no details of how they detect and classify these ads. I&#x27;ve had an entire Domain flagged and blocked off by SafeBrowsing because a single page on a subdomain was displaying an ad (via DoubleClick) which linked to malware.",1454605171

Obviously this is not &quot;nothing&quot;, because your body does a lot of cool stuff with all of that jiggling.<p>Obviously, chemical effects can also happen due to accumulated electric potential, as when a metal fork causes sparks in a microwave, but cell phones only have one hundredth or thousandth of that much power going through them at any given time, and the most visible effects of this in the human body seem to be negligible. (These effects do exist -- witness what tasers do to people, or what a 9V battery feels like on the tongue -- but nobody really reports these feelings when holding a transmitting cell phone near their tongue.)<p>So the possibilities are certainly there but it does seem like if cell phones caused the calamities that are sometimes attributed to them, it would probably change our understanding of one of these two spaces.",1454605103

Those who do not enjoy it should not be forced to pay for the stadium.  I would even oppose using eminent domain to acquire a contiguous area of land large enough to build one, with the sole possible exception of Green Bay, Wisconsin, where the Packers are <i>very nearly</i> a municipal corporation due to their &quot;ownership&quot; structure (non-voting, non-dividend-paying, restricted-resale stocks <i>don&#x27;t</i> count as ownership, in my opinion).<p>Selling the naming rights to the stadium to the highest bidder is just twisting the knife in the back, really.<p>This article is similar in character to economic retrospectives of cities that hosted Olympics competitions.  The IOC always promises an instant boost to prosperity, but that never seems to materialize.  I have been to Turner Field (formerly the primary 1996 Olympic stadium), and the surrounding area does not look very boosted (although other parts of Atlanta are admittedly much worse).  The stadium is coming down in 2017, as a 20-year-old building is apparently no longer good enough for the Braves to play baseball in it.  Their previous home at Atlanta-Fulton Cty Stadium only lasted 30 years.<p>For reference purposes, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field are both more than 100 years old and still in use.  Stadiums in Kansas City, LA, and Anaheim are pentagenarians.  Milwaukee County Stadium made it to 50 before the Brewers traded up.  Yankee Stadium retired at 85.  Tiger Stadium lasted 87 years.  Candlestick Park retired at 53.  Memorial Stadium (Baltimore, 2nd) lasted 53 years.<p>From a cursory examination of history, a city is much better off building its own smaller stadium, sized for basketball, hockey, and rock concerts, than one that can only reasonably be filled by MLB baseball, NFL football, Olympic track and field, club soccer (in Europe), and musical superstars.  Offering public subsidy to a privately owned single-sport stadium strikes me as brain-damaged beyond all reasonable measure, especially when the sports franchise seeking to build it is currently leasing a publicly-owned facility.",1454604936

As a British citizen, if you decide to marry a non-EU person, be prepared for hell when you try to get them in.

These policies are a result of the governments impossible, damaging pledge to get immigration &quot;in the tens of thousands&quot;.

Science-based medicine is rare but important[1] because even clinical trials, if done with small enough sample size and enough researcher degrees of freedom, can produce spurious results, which are all the more convincing because they appear to be backed up by good methodology.<p>But of course here we don&#x27;t even have a randomized controlled trial, but only a very poorly conducted observational study in an obscure journal that is implausible on scientific grounds. If there is any association here, likely it results from some coincidental lifestyle association between cell phone use (wherever the cell phones are put) and sperm quality. (P.S. I&#x27;m a father of four children, but three of those four were born before I became a regular cell phone user.

This never happened pre Mavericks.<p>* In general, all my Apple default software on my iphone is sitting in a folder titled &quot;apple&quot;, which I never use. I don&#x27;t think I use any Apple default App.<p>* I avoid icloud. It sends scary &quot;do you want to delete all these files&quot; messages if you ever unsync a device, and it&#x27;s not clear which actions produce which effects. iTunes has a history of destroying files on syncs, so I can&#x27;t trust iCloud.

Easy to use, incredibly powerful. Have a look at their manual for the level of care they put into their software, as recently as 2009.<p>Pages 13 can&#x27;t do half of that.

But since almost everyone is now producing similar levels of unreliable and unstable products, there&#x27;s little you can do to get away from it.<p>Combined with the version ratcheting problem we were discussing a week or so ago here on HN, also in connection with Apple but also a much wider problem within the industry, it&#x27;s becoming almost impossible to simply choose and use software you actually want, and to upgrade if and when a better version for your needs is available.

I would not blame this on inability to make quality products but bad high level choices. What is xCode today used to be multiple separate apps. The synch process for iPhone used to be separate programs. Now we are getting these huge monolithic programs like xCode and iTunes. Making big monoliths just isn&#x27;t good software engineering IMHO. They should stick more to the original sound Unix philosophy. Make smaller apps which do a few things well. I think if users find it cumbersome to use multiple programs together, then the solution isn&#x27;t to combine them all into one but to create an Operating System environment which makes it easy to use multiple programs together.<p>I think xCode e.g. which I use every day could easily be made into 3 different programs. 1) Project management and configuration. One program where you define which pieces go into your project. How they are compiled, deployed etc. 2) An Editor component which does syntax highlighting, refactoring, code navigation etc. 3) A GUI designer.<p>Sure integration has its benefits. But it also has many big disadvantages. Many people like to use different editor components, e.g. AppCode does refactoring and code navigation better in many people&#x27;s view than xCode. Yet it becomes an incomplete solution as they do not have as sophisticated GUI design and project management tools. But it these were separate tools which could just as well be used with AppCode one could inspire much more diversity.<p>Likewise the monolithic iTunes locks out any kind of alternative third party solutions. There should be one synching applications which can sync content like pictures, books, music etc. But that is all it should do. Movies, Music, Apps etc should be separate apps and we should allow alternative third party alternatives to these. People might want other ways to display and organize their iTunes music e.g.",1454603295

Spotlight now covers up way too much of the screen for almost no gain; if I&#x27;d wanted that, I&#x27;d have just used Alfred. Mission Control is still not as powerful and flexible as Expose + Spaces, and now it even goes so far as to hide desktop thumbnails even on my dual 27&quot; monitor setup. Seriously?<p>What&#x27;s most shocking to me is how much Windows has caught up from a UX perspective. I have Windows 10 on my (primarily gaming-oriented) desktop. Since I don&#x27;t use the desktop for much programming, I almost never find myself wishing that it was running OS X instead. That&#x27;s a real blow to the magical grip that OS X once held over me. Cortana is just as good as spotlight -- better, even -- and it manages to be much more space efficient as well. Windows Explorer is so much more useful than the bafflingly overly simplistic Finder. On Windows, if I want to tile windows, I can -- get this -- just drag them to the side, top, or any of the four corners. On OS X, I have to either fiddle with their impressively clunky split-screen full-screen app disaster or use a third-party tool like Spectacle or BetterTouchTool.<p>I could go on, but I&#x27;ll leave it at this: there was a day where I never wanted to touch Windows again because I felt OS X was so much better. Now I find myself only really sticking to OS X for two reasons: (1) it still has better touchpad interaction on a laptop; (2) it&#x27;s still based on Unix so I prefer it for programming.",1454602963

Currently the model defines biological bodies as containers of water. This is clearly wrong.<p>What I propose is standard antenna science. Something needs to resonate with the biological systems. In artificial antennas there are free electrons. In biological bodies there are ions and polar molecules. Most proteins are diamagnetic, except when they are in reaction. These are the things that we need to concentrate on.<p>There are also new discoveries that show that biology uses quantum super position states in some of the important proteins. This allows these proteins to be far more sensitive to electromagnetism. For example: the magnetic sense of birds depend on it. Another example is chlorophyll, which becomes more sensitive to light (which is an EM-wave) than usual.  \nOther discoveries show that DNA might be a conductor. And in combination with EM-radiation the functioning of parts of the DNA can be reduced or enhanced.  \nThis is new science which clearly shows that we were wrong about the effect of electromagnetism and biology before.<p>Also interesting are processes in biology that have certain frequencies of themselves like the firing of neurons. And other repetitive processes like the transcoding of DNA to RNA and of RNA to proteins.<p>Note that all these antenna possibilities depend on certain frequencies. On some frequencies we might see no result at all, while on others it affects a certain process in a negative or even positive way. And looking a the actual research at <a href=""http://www.microwavenews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microwavenews.com</a> this seems to be the case. A lot of research show some kind of effect (negative and positive), while others don&#x27;t.<p>Sadly many scientists do not know much about both biology and antennas. They usually talk about ionization and heat, which are not the problem at all. It is actually very stupid to see that as the problem.<p>I do not think that EM-radiation is totally bad. It is just something that is damaging on the long term due to stress and disturbance of the biological processes and systems (when they resonate with the specific frequencies of the signals).",1454602928

I&#x27;ve found it best to try to work around the problem by minimising my OS dependencies where possible. This is actually easier for games than for apps -- games can take over the whole screen and have their own weird UI, while apps have to integrate nicely.<p>I&#x27;d say:\n- Find a nice robust framework. I&#x27;m using the built-in NativeApplication and I regret it. I think SDL might be a good bet. Lots of people like Unity (but it seems very heavyweight to me for small games).\n- For a portable game, C or C++ is your best bet right now. (Or Unity&#x27;s C#.)\n- Pick a nice baseline API level and stick to it. You can actually go right back to API 8 (Android 2.2!) and you get OpenGL ES 2.0, which is an important milestone for games. I&#x27;d like to update my games to ES 3 at some point, but that only works from Android 4.3 onwards (fewer than 50% of users) so I&#x27;m holding out for now.\n- Avoid using Java if you can help it! Seriously.\n- Avoid using the file system if you can help it. The APIs are very bad and the hardware is often bad too, many manufacturers seem to cut corners here.\n- Figure out a good crash reporting / feedback system. I haven&#x27;t actually found a good one for native apps, I&#x27;d love advice on that! HockeyApp is great on the Java side.\n- Figure out a good testing system. I ended up just buying lots of old phones and tablets on eBay and Amazon. Getting a good mix of screen sizes and CPU types is key (there are quite a few x86 tablets out there, it turns out).<p>I haven&#x27;t even looked at Android TV yet. :)",1454602889

The Surface line from Microsoft is astounding in quality, and it&#x27;s only a few generations old. This latest line did have some bugs (mostly due to Intel,) but overall when I walk into a Best Buy, and I feel a Surface Book and look over at a MacBook, one feels like the future, while one feels like it&#x27;s hugging the past.<p>The problem with Apple, and I&#x27;ve said this for ages, is that Apple is fashion. It&#x27;s a status symbol, Sony used to be that same way, and look at it now. It had similar business verticals, pushed the same proprietary nonsense instead of adopting what the rest of the industry is doing and they were drowned as they began to expand their portfolio of devices.<p>Apple makes great quality devices, but Apple also enjoys massive hardware margins.

He specifically mentions the dependence on Apple, e.g. if they change their search algorithm he may be fucked, and there&#x27;s no independence there. He&#x27;s small-time and has near zero revenue streams outside of the apple store. (he mentions the Android port being a failure).<p>About the Android port failure... he&#x27;s saying Android makes him barely any money at all, but you can imagine he spent $10-20k on that at least last year.<p>The first year he did things like hire a studio to record an audio book. That may sound cheap, but a bible audio book is 70-75 hours long, and each hour recorded costs $300-600 (you could also do it for $200 or $800, but both aren&#x27;t very typical). Even for low-quality, shortened books, it&#x27;s still a significant expense.<p>He&#x27;s got costs, the $100k isn&#x27;t even operating profit, let alone net income.<p>For example, he mentions he increased his revenue from $75k to $100k from y1 to y2, but also lost money due to new licensing deals that cut deep into his margins, saying that he&#x27;s not sure it was worth it.<p>Between a new revenue stream of which he doesn&#x27;t think it was profitable, and a port to a new app store which he says generates practically non-existent revenue, it doesn&#x27;t look like he&#x27;s got the resources to singlehandedly build this out to a ridiculous cash cow. The $100k of course is awesome, but he&#x27;s had to put in time to make it grow (inc. a brand new app, none of that he refers to when he says he has 1 hour of monthly work to sustain the app), some of these growth projects failed, and he probably invested quite a bit in the first place, more than the $500 he refers to as his initial investment.<p>After taxes and expenses I&#x27;d expect say $50k to be left as net income. I&#x27;d take $500k too, for sure. That $50k to say $75k tops he&#x27;s netting per year, takes at least 8-10 years to beat a $500k lump sum that&#x27;s reinvested. Now of course he has opportunities to grow the business, but here&#x27;s the thing... if he grows the business, he&#x27;s now working part-time or full-time, which carries a significant opportunity cost, too. And it&#x27;s not without direct costs, either, like developing or licensing content. Further, in those 8-10 years everything can change, particularly the competitive landscape, the OP&#x27;s purchaser probably would&#x27;ve bought another top 5 app and thrown resources at it.<p>In short, I think he did quite well with $500k but that&#x27;s based on a lot of my assumptions and interpretations of his brief comments.",1454602370

There&#x27;s no doubt that Chrome gave Firefox a much-needed shot in the arm.<p>Many developers/advanced users, including myself, see Firefox as a bastion of freedom in what is otherwise a land grab by major OS vendors, an attempt to further increase their lock-in. Users remember Firefox as the browser that was so flexible, Firebug was possible, which sent every browser vendor into a tizzy to try to clone the featureset natively. Users remember Firefox as the browser that gives them control over their experience, unlike Chrome which babysits and won&#x27;t let you interfere with Google&#x27;s need to harvest data.<p>The first 2 years that Chrome was out, it trounced Firefox all around. I switched back to Fx around that time. These days, Firefox&#x27;s JavaScript performance is comparable if not better than Chrome&#x27;s [0] and its extension ecosystem and extreme configurability make it a much better option than Chrome for me. The only reason I use Chrome now is to take advantage of the proprietary extensions that allow me to use Netflix or Flash on Linux.<p>Mozilla has always and will always be a tinkerer&#x27;s vendor.

There are many parameters to software quality – reliability, speed, user experience, design, discoverability, and more – and a move towards any of these virtues leads to sacrifices in others, especially on a limited time schedule. Additionally, a number of forces influence software quality over time, like accommodating for different use cases, changes in platform, changes in hardware, changes in design preferences, changes in market, changes in expectations, and more. Finally, software is not like digging a hole, say, where more people really can dig a hole faster than fewer people: in fact, more people can often slow down a software project.<p>Nobody knows this better than the technology titans of today: Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle have all experience unanticipated software problems and regressions and high profile bugs. These are organizations with thousands of programmers writing and maintaining millions of lines of code for billions of devices. And these devices are machines which require perfection: one slight ambiguity of intent, any minor breach of contract, any single unexpected 0 where there should be 1 or vice versa … has the capability the bring down the whole system. In fact, it often does. Countless kernel panics, stack overflow errors, null pointer exceptions, and memory leaks are plaguing poor users and tired system administrators and overworked programmers right now. Machines are fast, but they can be awfully dumb.<p>And no company is feeling the pain of software’s nebulous nature and hardware’s mindless computing more than Apple right now. The underdog that many loyal fans rooted for is now the world’s (perhaps previous) most valuable company. With that, comes insanely high expectations: they need to grow the world’s biggest company every quarter to keep Wall Street happy, and even harder, they have to keep those nerds that kept them alive through the hard times happy too. And with release after release of the most revolutionary operating system ever, it’s tempting to picture Apple like an actual Titan, in particular Atlas, holding the world upon his shoulders. But it seems more and more every day that another Greek tale is more fitting: it’s time to admit that Apple have flown too close to the sun.<p>Walt Mossberg, technology journalism’s elder statesman, has this to say about Apple’s software quality:<p><pre><code>    In the last couple of years, however, I’ve noticed a gradual degradation in the quality and reliability of Apple’s core apps, on both the mobile iOS operating system and its Mac OS X platform. It’s almost as if the tech giant has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to these core software products, while it pursues big new dreams, like smartwatches and cars.\n</code></pre>\nOn OS X this is especially true: OpenGL implementation has fallen behind the competition, the filesystem desperately needs updating, the SDK has needed modernizing for years, networking and cryptography have seen major gaffes. And that’s with regards to the under-the-hood details, the applications are easier targets: it’s tragic that Aperture and iPhoto were axed in favor of the horrifically bad Photos app (that looks like some Frankenstein “iOS X” app), the entire industry have left Final Cut Pro X, I dare not plug my iPhone in to my laptop for fear of what it might do, the Mac App Store is the antitheses of native application development (again being some Frankenstein of a web/native app), and iCloud nee MobileMe nee iTools has been an unreliable and slow mess since day one.<p>This isn’t the first time that a prominent member of the Apple community has criticized Apple’s software quality. Here’s Marco Arment from January of 2015:<p><pre><code>    Apple’s hardware today is amazing — it has never been better. But the software quality has fallen so much in the last few years that I’m deeply concerned for its future. I’m typing this on a computer whose existence I didn’t even think would be possible yet, but it runs an OS with embarrassing bugs and fundamental regressions. Just a few years ago, we would have relentlessly made fun of Windows users for these same bugs on their inferior OS, but we can’t talk anymore.\n</code></pre>\nThis is still as true today as it was last year. Macs and iPhones have gotten thinner, more beautiful, and more powerful; the Apple Watch and the new Apple TV are magnificent additions to the product line up. But I’d speculate that part of the problem Apple is having is that if it took 1,000 engineers to write software for Mac when that was the only product, it doesn’t necessarily take 4,000 people to write software for four product lines. In fact, 10,000 of the same grade of engineers might not even do it, especially without proper management and unified goals. Apple may not have listened to rockstar developer Marco Arment, but Walt Mossberg will definitely get there attention. Here’s an anecdote about Steve Jobs from the last time that Mossberg complained about Apple’s software quality:<p><pre><code>    In Fortune’s story, Lashinsky says Steve Jobs summoned the entire MobileMe team for a meeting at the company’s on-campus Town Hall, accusing everyone of “tarnishing Apple’s reputation.” He told the members of the team they “should hate each other for having let each other down”, and went on to name new executives on the spot to run the MobileMe team. A few excerpts from the article.\n\n    “Can anyone tell me what MobileMe is supposed to do?” Having received a satisfactory answer, he continues, “So why the fuck doesn’t it do that?”\n\n    Jobs was also particularly angry about the Wall Street Journal’s Walt Mossberg not liking MobileMe:\n\n    “Mossberg, our friend, is no longer writing good things about us.”\n</code></pre>\nIt really is time for Tim Cook to take action as drastic as this regarding software quality on Apple’s existing platforms. What worries me is that APPL the stock ticker and Apple the company are in a (self-driving) crash course with one another: APPL needs to launch new products to drive growth and Apple needs to improve the products that have already shipped. The most valuable asset that Apple own is their brand, and that’s the brand that’ll drive sales of any car that may or may not be in development. If that brand name is tarnished by regressions and performance problems, what consumer would buy a car from the brand? In fact, anecdotally, talking to my friends, the Apple Car already has an uphill battle with the kerfuffle surrounding the Maps launch.<p>Jim Dalrymple, in response to Mossberg, writes:<p><pre><code>    I understand that Apple has a lot of balls in the air, but they have clearly taken their eye off some of them. There is absolutely no doubt that Apple Music is getting better with each update to the app, but what we have now is more of a 1.0 version than what we received last year.\n</code></pre>\nJohn Gruber, in response to Dalrymple:<p><pre><code>    Maybe we expect too much from Apple’s software. But Apple’s hardware doesn’t have little problems like this.\n</code></pre>\nThe best thing for Apple to do is to re-take their position as a leader of software quality before it’s too late: consumers know that Apple’s hardware is the very best, but more and more their using apps made by Google and Microsoft and Facebook. If this trend doesn’t turn around, Apple will find their breakout product and all of its growth will be owned by competitors. And when the time comes to launch their car, they’ll find that loyal fans and everyday consumers have lost trust in the brand. Having said that, I’m still a Mac user at home and at work, my iPhone is a wonderful device that I enriches my life, and I’m still finding new ways to make use of Apple Watch. And to give credit where credit is due: Logic Pro X has improved a lot recently, and Music Memos is a welcome addition to Apple’s music line up. I even use Apple Maps. Apple can do this. It’s not too late. But for sake of all us poor users, and Apple’s tired system administrators and overworked programmers, I hope they started 6 months ago.",1454601827

Use a lottery system to decide who gets in and who doesn&#x27;t.<p>3) Central planning.

Some people are genuinely in love with anything new.  Some people just get bored easily.  Those might not be the best motivations, but they&#x27;re not the worst.  The worst is the people who jump all over a new language or technology because they know peers are unfamiliar with it.  They&#x27;re insecure.  They&#x27;re not confident in their ability to master the standards and best practices that are already established for an older technology, so they try to get in first on a new technology where those things haven&#x27;t evolved yet.  No rules to violate.  Then their arrogance as kings of the new hill, combined with their obvious cluelessness about the broader context, puts everyone off what might have been a true advance in the state of the art.

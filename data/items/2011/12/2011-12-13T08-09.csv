1) Having a habit of exercising daily for 30 minutes. No compromise on this. This is a good antidote for depression.
2) A habit of getting up at 5 daily and doing the most important thing at that time. This habit alone can change your life and to cultivate this hard habit in a ridiculously easy manner please check this article: <a href=""http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right...</a> 
3) Having a Vision Board. I use text instead of images. They are more direct. I change it every week to keep it fresh and inspiring all the time. As a part of the morning ritual, I stare at the vision board for about 5 to 10 minutes and is also close to where I sleep.

They are using psychology to entice kids to spend their parents' money when they're not looking; that's different.<p>> True, people who actually participate in penny auctions probably have IQs worse than 7 yr olds.<p>This is an outrageous statement and I'm sure you realize this. These strategies are profitable precisely <i>because</i> you don't have to be ridiculously stupid to be fooled. It's the same reason casinos work.<p>Everything these companies are doing is legal and whether we morally agree or not, this is how the business game is played: you find (hopefully legal) ways to get people to give you money.<p>If one of those ways is enticing people to <i>voluntarily</i> agree to pay app store fees that they incur through their use, and then enticing them (or someone else on their behalf) to incur those fees, you've won the business game and you deserve the profits. Let customers vote with their money elsewhere if they disagree. Welcome to the free market.<p>Every time you walk into a store, you are being manipulated with psychological tricks centuries in the making. And any parent has paid far more for useless stuff they were psychologically coaxed into getting than their kids will ever spend on the app store.<p>Yet whenever children are involved, the slightest sign of ""sleaze"" triggers rage -- a deliciously ironic example of the same psychology these business people use to get your money :).",1323764689

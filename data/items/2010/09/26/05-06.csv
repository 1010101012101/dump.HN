1728601,comment,1727827,1728151,0,0,allengoodman,,,"I agree, our defect might be insurmountable. However, reducing spending, while important, is comparatively ineffective to increasing revenue. In the later part of this decade, because of changes in Social Security, you're likely to see less traction from spending reductions than you might think. Therefore, we must increase revenue sooner than later. Furthermore, most of this should come from the middle class. We cannot sustain our deficit with the current middle class tax rate.<p>That said, our short-term deficit issue could be address immediately. If we cancel the entirety of the Bush tax cuts, we could stabilize our deficit without major expenditure decreases or revenue increases.<p>From a stimulatory perspective, It's true that a lower income tax rate is better than a higher tax rate, but the benefit is marginal. I'd look up the forecast, but hilariously, the C.B.O. website is unavailable. I think the cost benefit is two years of full-time employment per million dollars of total-budget. Interestingly, changes in the income tax rate get most of the press, but it's largely ineffective in comparison to other stimulatory options (e.g. decreasing payroll taxes and extending unemployment benefits being the two most beneficial).",1285478916

Most probably Adsense for feeds, which I don't think allows me to rev share.

Someone who just “makes pretty stuff in photoshop” should probably be called a “digital illustrator” or a “photo retoucher”, or a “digital imaging expert”, not a “graphic designer”.",1285477476

But there is something strange in his proposal to carve out $10,000 for five early investors and offer them an immediate 10x ROI on paper just for jumping first.<p>First of all, $10,000 is not enough money to justify giving away equity in any company with reasonable prospects, especially since issuing the equity costs money over time. This is the same problem with the Twilio fund (they should just offer free service to pre-revenue start-ups).<p>Second, assuming the major value of social proof is the assurance it provides later investors that people they respect see the risk-return ratio as favorable enough to risk their own capital, this will accomplish nothing but shift the equilibrium towards smaller rounds for entrepreneurs while demands for social proof will shift correspondingly (""But who else has invested $50,000...."").<p>I respect Mark's investing in small business. But as a single founder with a bootstrapped business (outside SV), I'd chalk up someone who even suggested this as just trying to exploit me. I do think it's a good idea for investors to get compensation for effort put into organizing rounds. But the founder-friendly arrangement is performance based though, not ""giving a good deal to investors [who founders] expect to help them [sometime in the future]"".",1285477439

And making a physical product is generally MUCH more frustrating than anything in web app land.  Hurrying up and waiting, for a flawed product messed up by the machinists.  Also much higher startup capital costs for anything nontrivial like semiconductors.  Expensive equipment, office space, manufacturing space, all this stuff you need to start.  Not just two or three guys with open source software working in a dorm.<p>Studying the physical sciences is also more mentally taxing than coding PHP.  I've gotten paid for both.  You can't compare designing aircraft in CAD and Excel (what I do) that could kill someone if done improperly, with setting up email verification for your social networking site.

2048171,comment,2047485,2048036,0,0,schmichael,,,"Such distinctions have been discussed to death over the past 10-15 years, but the most obvious benefit is to allow developers to know something about an API without having used it before: PUT, DELETE, and GET to resources are all idempotent operations that act on an entire resource. A PUT to a collection acts on the entire collection. On the other hand a POST to a collection creates a new resource in that collection.<p>You can know all of those things and more about a RESTful web service without reading a line of documentation. So I would personally consider the distinctions between HTTP verbs very useful and quite underutilized.<p>The UNIX filesystem is another example where distinctions between seemingly arbitrary terms helps a user know more about a system without knowing details about a specific implementation: /home is for user data, /etc for configuration, /var can probably be mounted non-executable, /usr/local mirrors /usr, etc.<p>Despite a wide range of variation amongst implementations, someone familiar with these distinctions can navigate fairly comfortably on a wide range of operating systems and distributions.<p>On the other hand, let's pretend my patch is worthless. I would hope that doesn't lessen the usefulness of my post. My attempt was not to enforce some pedantic standards compliance but rather introduce developers to how to diagnose problems and come to solutions.",1293605360

Actually, all team members want to grow, but in different areas and at different pace.<p>In other words, good manager must always ensure that team members are  challenged and they have feeling of actual growth and accomplishments.<p>I believe that ""growth"" is the most neglected part.

2048164,comment,2047568,2047852,0,0,tobtoh,,,"Yup - sadly I have to agree with you - and unfortunately with no support from senior management, all that encourages is PHB behaviour.<p>However, part of being a good manager (although they seldom teach managers how to do this) is being able to manage the boss/senior management/execs so that those people develop the confidence to allow the manager to exercise their 'non-egocentric management style' - it's a lot of work and damn hard if the senior managers don't have faith in this, but it can be done.<p>In my experience, my bosses do trust me because every time I delegate responsibility to my team and they complete the task successfully, I make a point of saying 'I told you so'.  But I've had to put my own reputation on the line many times backing my team to do the job without my micro-management. And I the reason I have confidence in my team is because I spend a lot of time coaching my team leads and senior techs who in turn coach the rest of the team.<p>Ultimately, IMHO, the key to a good manager is one who spends time with their team and has the strength to carve out time in their daily routine to do so. It isn't an easy task and sadly often goes unsupported and unrecognised.<p>Edit: Oh and the way I carve out time for my team - I let any phone call that is not from a recognised number (and even some that do) go through to voicemail. My staff are always amazed when they are talking with me that I will ignore a ringing phone (even if it's from my boss) and focus on them. My argument is that even if a system has gone down, there are plenty of 'escalation' contacts to try - the manager should not be the micro-managing escalation bottleneck - especially when they are engaged in face to face conversations. To me, it's basic respect - but I also find that by following this policy, people gain confidence in the rest of the team to handle escalations and I gain so much valuable time which I then invest back in my team.",1293605130

I think it's important to see the non-technical factors that may cause a new scheme to lose out to even technically-inferior alternatives. How much value is there in a NIST or NSA rubber stamp? Well, so far MS and Mozilla have only implemented Suite B curves. How hurtful is the ECC patent FUD? Well, look at how much work Red Hat did to strip all ECC code from all the software they ship in their products. How likely is it that there will be a standard that takes off without being distributed by either Microsoft or Red Hat (or Oracle or CentOS)? What would it take to get Curve25519 used in Firefox? Well, there's not much reward for implementing a curve that isn't going to be implemented by many other browsers or servers, so it's hard to justify spending time to consider it, even ignoring the NIST/NSA/IETF/IANA angle.",1293605095

Relatedly, to learn that particular character, you just write it on a piece of paper until your fingers bleed, and put it in your journal of words with some sample sentences, combinations, etc.<p>The programming journal thing is a good way to learn programming.

I'm curious how you defend the assertion that you write HTML for humans. You write it on a computer, for other computers, with quite a lot of markup that humans are never going to see. For every ten thousand pageloads, how many people do you think are going to hit ""view source?"" Writing for ""other humans"" would be something like a document in a WYSIWYG editor, like Word.<p>The comparison to code is even more hilariously in-apt. A parser or a complier <i>ignores</i> the indentation and commenting when producing the final product.",1293603475

2048107,comment,2048013,2048013,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"There are two issues I see here.<p>The first is the quality of answers to ""normal guy"" questions (e.g. questions anyone could answer).  The problem here is answer sites are only as good as how they scale.  As has been pointed out several times in the comments of various Quora posts Yahoo Answers wasn't a overrun with Spam on day one.  So Quora's future is heavily reliant on how it survives once it does go mainstream.<p>The second issue is the celebrity questions and the ""Democratization of Source Material"".  The problem with his theory is he forgets source information becomes more valuable the more relevant it is.  So while Steve Case answering how much all those AOL CDs cost might be interesting it's not going to draw major traffic like Natalie Portman talking about her pregnancy for the first time.  News that draws traffic is valuable and celebrities trade it for things of value (favorable coverage, money, etc...)  This is true of almost all source material Quora could generate and that's why I don't see it taking on major news agencies anytime soon.<p>I'm not saying Quora isn't a nice web site or that it can't be successful.  Just that it's being over hyped.",1293603115

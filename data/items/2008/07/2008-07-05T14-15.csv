Its easy when your town is small to keep it surrounded by levees and the flood waters at bay, but there comes a point when the town is just too big, a weak spot inevitably occurs and the flood waters come roaring in.",1215269862

Evolution, on the other hand, has been very well explained from all possible fronts.<p>The problem with gravity is that, as a daily experience, it fades out into uninteresting routine (except perhaps for rocket scientists and other specialists.)",1215269817
236956,comment,236465,236831,0,0,jsb,,,"The Google index algorithm is a trade secret. Whatever they published while at school is available and is often studied in search engine classes, but the most recent version algorithm is probably only available to only the most necessary people. PageRank is part of this algorithm but isn't the only part in determining where a result will fall.<p>This ""FriendRank"" algorithm will also be a trade secret. The patent here based on my quick scan is patenting the method that they will use to advertise to people using this FriendRank through Google's services or future services. For example, where it will be placed on the screen and how it will look.",1215269789

236951,comment,236808,236865,0,0,icey,,,"Frankly, I believe that a lot of people who call themselves Athiests are in fact Agnostics; and don't really stop to think about the difference.<p>I would venture to guess that most scientists especially are agnostic because it fits the scientific method better - we can not presume to know what we cannot measure, and all that.<p>Atheism is the idea that we <i>know</i> that there is know higher power. Any scientist has to know that it is impossible to have that absolute knowledge because we have no tests to prove or disprove the hypothesis.",1215269340
236950,comment,236703,236703,0,0,microcentury,,,"Not too impressed with this article, I have to say.<p>It seems pretty obvious that people will not switch from the GOOG just because MS has attained search quality parity (which, incidentally, I doubt). If they built a _better_ search engine than Google, then people would go there and use that instead, and the advertisers would follow. Then they wouldn't need to buy Yahoo.<p>The Yahoo strategy to me seems to imply acceptance that they just cannot equal Google in terms of search quality, so they are looking for another way to compete. Saying they're of equal quality doesn't make it so.",1215269169

Well I think that is a kind of extension that you shouldn't capitalize. When you do business, you have to do marketing and one way to do it is by advertising. Isn't that irony for you to advertise a product that blocks ads?",1215268049

</code></pre>
That statement has no meaning.<p>There is no fundamental understanding regarding the concept of ""outside time and space"", because our knowledge of them both derives from experience. To have some understanding of 'outside', you would have to have received that information <i>a priori</i>. That would mean that everyone had received that information, however.<p>Since, we can readily determine that the difference between believers and non-believers is a matter of experience. The difference between the two has nothing to do with ""outside"" either time and space, because that ""outside"" is not experiencable (at this point in time).",1215267586

236934,comment,236896,236896,0,0,edu,,,"I think that these are <i>bad</i> tips. Coffee is ok, but you don't have to abuse. Eat properly is a good tip, but I don't think it's related to staying awake. Naps are a great thing, but never do a 1 hour nap! Something like 20 to 30 minutes is a <i>great</i> way to refresh your mind. The windows thing is a good thing, but like food, I don't know if it will help you to stay awake: in summer I sleep with an open window by my bed. Creative distractions are ok, but I think of lego, smart putty, a paper and a pencil, some bal, blogging (writing, not reading)... facebook <i>doesn't</i> count as a <i>creative</i> distraction nor does Hacker News, although at least HN is inspiring.<p>Finally, I'll add my own tip: exercise. Go take a short walk around the office/home, or a little bit skating. Exercise will wake you up like anything else, and will put your brain in a more aware state. Also, a cold shower is a better way than coffee to get a quick boost.",1215266638
236933,comment,236808,236892,0,0,rbanffy,,,"""No, the lazy choice is to have the visions of the infinite you mention and instead of trying to understand them""<p>There is some ground between being religious and being an atheist. Being an atheist implies some degree of faith. The question whether there is a God cannot be answered within our current knowledge (and it may pretty well remain so until the end of our universe). An atheist firmly believes the answer is ""no"". An agnostic acknowledges we are unable to answer the question. Maybe in a million years, maybe never. Interestingly, the only answer science can give to questions like these is on the lines of ""we can neither prove nor disprove this hypothesis"".<p>As I use to joke, I lack the faith required to be an atheist. ;-)",1215266563

For instance, anything made by Columbia Games.<p>If you study them mathematically, many of those games are actually quite a bit simpler than chess or go, because despite the large number of pieces, turn limits, order limits and very limited setup options will shrink the decision space in a major way.<p>Those games are also easier to solve because, often to provide a light semblance to how history actually turned out, the rules are set up so that entire avenues of approach are restricted.<p>So why are AIs worse? because when you make a videogame, getting the hardest AI possible is not really a selling point.  We worry instead about not taking too much time, or, in case of a mobile game, not eating the processor alive. Those limits make entire sets of approaches to AI unworkable altogether. If a machine was allowed to think as long as the human does, and we had a reason to actually built said AI, you&#x27;d see humans losing a whole lot in wargames.

If\nthe lines above were unclear, here is the entire &quot;python3&quot; version. Note\nthat we now explicitly treat standard input and output as binary (which is\n&quot;wrong&quot;):<p><pre><code>    import sys\n    import shutil\n\n    for filename in sys.argv[1:]:\n        f = sys.stdin.buffer\n        if filename != &#x27;-&#x27;:\n            try:\n                f = open(filename, &#x27;rb&#x27;)\n            except IOError as err:\n                print >> sys.stderr, &#x27;cat.py: %s: %s&#x27; % (filename, err)\n                continue\n        with f:\n            shutil.copyfileobj(f, sys.stdout.buffer)\n</code></pre>\nAnd we can now, for example:<p><pre><code>    $ head -c 200 /bin/ls | python3 test3.py -\n    ELF>�H@@p�@8  @@@@@@�88@8@@ $\n</code></pre>\nThe crucial difference is, that if we <i>wanted</i> only to deal with text,\nwe&#x27;d get a sane error (see above) from python3. I&#x27;d probably add a\ncomment about the sys.stdin.buffer as it isn&#x27;t exactly obvious that what\nwe do is go from stdin that is a text stream to the underlying buffer\nthat is binary -- but I can&#x27;t really agree that this is super-hard -- it\ntook me a few minutes to google &quot;python3 binary io&quot; and find this…<p>And all these scripts (appear to) deal fine with utf-8 file names both\nin python2 and 3.<p>[edit: Having redone this by hand, I see that this is sort of what the &quot;new&quot; script in the post does, with some caveats on how stdin/out is &quot;sometimes&quot; not not binary...

Recently we considered whether it&#x27;s worthwhile to continue maintaining our own ORM or if we should switch. As part of the investigation our CTO spoke with a roundtable group at the Microsoft Build conference, and the consensus was that EF was not mature enough to meet our needs. This came from some people who are involved with developing EF.<p>In the end, we decided to continue to maintain and enhance our own ORM, because of the special features it has to support the Enterprise niches we work with.

An example:<p>You have a posts db table (or collection in the case of Parse, since they&#x27;re using MongoDB) and a user_posts table. The user_posts table contains references to the posts to show in each user&#x27;s personalized feed (fan out model). When a post is created, the app needs to perform x inserts into user_posts, where x is the number of users who&#x27;s feed will include this post. EACH insert counts as a request in Parse, so if a user with 100 followers posts something that needs to be distributed to the 100 follower feeds, that&#x27;ll require 100 requests/second.",1399920778

7734539,comment,7733639,7733746,14,0,spamizbad,,,"> Are these moves just going to stave a potential exodus of .Net developers or will it actually lead to new developers picking up the language?<p>I definitely think these changes will keep existing .NET developers in the fold. People who haven&#x27;t embraced the Microsoft ecosystem at this point probably won&#x27;t in the future.<p>Things I&#x27;d say hurt outsider adoption:<p>1) The ecosystem of freely available .NET libraries is minuscule compared to what you have with Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and probably even Node.  And the quality of .NET&#x27;s 3rd-party commercial packages are typically worse than what you&#x27;d expect from <i>free</i> open source libraries in terms of both software quality and documentation.<p>2) Going along with #1, things like database/service drivers, web service APIs, etc, are never as robust or feature-complete as their Python/Ruby/PHP/Java etc counterparts. And sometimes they&#x27;re really late to the party getting just a basic implementation going.<p>3) Many .NET shops are technologically conservative, for various reasons, and don&#x27;t embrace the new technologies. If you&#x27;re a developer excited about these technologies, understand that probably 80% of .NET shops will never touch these changes with a 10-foot pole for the next 5-10 years outside of rinky-dink projects.<p>4) The .NET library itself is kinda unwieldy, and only becomes easier to work with if you invest in expensive tools (Visual Studio). In the OSS world, you may have to install a few freely-available tools first, but you get the first-class experience for no cost pretty much right away. In the editor of your choice.<p>5) Once you step out of Azure, advanced deployments of Windows server have a sizable learning curve that rival Linux in terms of difficulty and complexity. In fact, today its probably harder, ever since Microsoft re-did technet to make it way more difficult to get comprehensive information on stuff.",1399919480

Often, the modifications are pointless (how do I move this button) or not very useful (what if I wanted to rearrange things to do this one thing asyncronously), but the process of reading the code and digging through it to figure out how to do it is helpful. In theory, if something is open source, a new developer could sit down and try to pick a few things off the bug tracker, but every time I&#x27;ve tried this it hasn&#x27;t worked out, usually you need to know a lot of context about a project before you can fix the bugs usefully.

7734388,comment,7731624,7731624,1,0,silentvoice,,,"I think I have a unique perspective on this, since I have both a strong CS training as well as a strong scientific computing training. I can look at code both from the perspective of producing useful scientific results as well as from the perspective of code quality (readability, maintainability, etc).<p>Scientific computing is a unique problem in programming that is different from what I think software engineers are accustomed to solving themselves. Performance is often extremely important, it trumps almost everything; yet changes need to be made to the code frequently which often necessitates rewrites. The software engineer solution to this is abstraction: hide details of conceptually unrelated components so that changes can be made in isolation without needing to propagate them through the whole source. Unfortunately throw in things like paper deadlines and abstraction quickly becomes a contradictory goal to performance. Since the kinds of changes one needs to make to scientific code can rarely be predicted (it&#x27;s research, by definition we don&#x27;t know what the results are before we get them), spending a huge amount of time on an extensible framework almost always is a waste of time since we can&#x27;t design it for the unknown (believe me, I have seen dozens of these and none of them have widespread adoption in research, despite being of very high &quot;code quality.&quot;).<p>Therefore an accepted practice is to write short hacks whose rewriting will be as painless as possible, if that is necessary. This is of course a generalization, not everybody does this. I&#x27;m just giving the reasoning behind this kind of code, and why modern practices are often ignored. The running assumption for this neglection is stubbornness or &quot;get of my lawn&quot; mentality from the researcher, but in my experience usually it&#x27;s not.",1399918107

SF people love their city for other reasons, and get a bit defensive about this attitude that tech is the only worthwhile thing about it.

That&#x27;s the position of the Obama administration - you have no right to question their assassinations, you must simply accept that the government knows who, when, and how to kill. That&#x27;s the question Rand Paul is asking in this essay (and a few others have asked before him), that&#x27;s why he says &#x27;show us the legal case&#x27;, and talks about the rights of all American citizens to a trial by jury rather than &#x27;this action was wrong&#x27;.<p>If you accept that the state has the power to kill without justification or investigation (before or after the fact), a lot of the other rights you are supposed to have as a citizen become meaningless. The rule of law (especially restricting the state) is vital to protect citizens without the resources to fight the state. That&#x27;s why this first question is so important, whatever you think of Anwar Awl Alaki. The rule of law <i>restricts the activities of the state</i> and makes it less powerful and effective, that is as it should be, so you shouldn&#x27;t argue that this makes our government less able to kill people quickly - that&#x27;s the point.<p>Moving on to the question you address of whether it was actually legal or justified - typically killings outside the judicial process and outside of wartime are viewed as assassinations and very difficult to justify; I&#x27;m not aware of evidence that Anwar Awl Alaki was planning a particular attack or involved in one, and the killing of his son a few weeks later along with some other teenage friends is based on even more tenuous evidence and justification (if any). We didn&#x27;t mean to kill him is not a reasonable excuse for a government agency outside of war, and to kill someone like a hostage taker a government agency would have to submit to an investigation afterward. Killing without trial or investigation means your government can assassinate citizens at will.",1399917627

Unless I missed it, I didn&#x27;t see a formula of how the models will be scored.  For example, you can have an objective function where predicting the winner gives you a lot more points than predicting which team will not make it out of the group stage.  Or you can have one where all the different stages are equally important.<p>Depending on the scoring method, it might be advantageous to generate solutions that are not mathematically correct, that is, solutions where each row sums to 1, but the columns don&#x27;t sum to 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 1, respectively.<p>You really need to define what the objective function is here.",1399917617

(And <i>that</i> discussion is most certainly best left to some other site, or preferably, over a good bottle of Italian red wine:-)",1182156877

My problem is that since these domains are not in-your-face advertised, or talked about here, it's harder to evaluate the market and the competition.<p>Plus, these apps usually need promotion of some kind, word-of-mouth doesn't really spread otherwise.",1182154718

On the one hand, there was an enormous population explosion (which had also been encouraged by Feudalism, I think, the ""owners"" of the people had an interest in owning more people for a while). Then Feudalism was abolished, and nobody took care of the people anymore. hence the poverty and their willingness to do awful work. In that sense, I don't think Capitalism was really to blame. I suspect a similar thing could be going on in China.",1182154665

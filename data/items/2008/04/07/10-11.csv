Like before this transaction, some other guy owns 10% of the company, and afterwards suddenly he only owns 8% - how is that possible? By claiming in theory that his 8% still have the same value in cash? But since all those are just virtual estimates, not hard transactions, how can you ever be safe from being screwed over?",1207565929

Usually whenever I pick up a philosophy book (rarely, I admit), there is a wrong assumption in the first paragraph and I can readily dismiss it as worthless.<p>Any philosophers the news.yc crowd could recommend?",1207564881

156782,comment,156775,156775,0,0,Tichy,,,"""Say for example your company currently has 1,000,000 shares outstanding. You and the investors settle on a valuation of $1 per share for a pre-money valuation of $1,000,000. The investors put in $250,000 and in exchange they are issued 250,000 shares. The post money valuation of the company is $1,250,000 and investors own 20% of the company.""<p>I have trouble understanding this. Why do they only own 20% of the company, if they own 25% of the shares?<p>I guess it is also a complication that the investment actually changes the value of the company (because it now has 250000$ more)? But wouldn't it make more sense to conclude that if an $250000 investment buys you 25% of the company, it is evaluated at 750000$ (before the investment)?<p>Sorry if I get this completely wrong, I am not used to those calculations.",1207564235

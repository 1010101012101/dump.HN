Some random thoughts go through my mind while i try to sleep and sometimes i think of problems and get to something like a solution. Usually its just a subconscious hint that i understand in the morning after thinking about it. But i don't remember my dreams, so i rarely get to solutions in my sleep, just some hints in my middle ground. But who knows, maybe i get some work done and don't know it.",1216043992

245700,comment,245668,245668,0,0,Tichy,,,"I used to develop for mobile Java, which took a long time to mature (not sure if it has matured, actually). They had a problem Apple doesn't have, inconsistencies across the thousands of devices. Still, I wonder if developing for iPhone would be like going back to the start again, with yet another immature platform.",1216043730

245698,comment,245615,245637,0,0,mrtron,,,"I think this thinking is what got them into a mess.  Sure it sounds like a great idea to create a framework, but for a one-off project it just doesn't make sense.<p>I think you would be much better off in that scenario trying to build great components that are well defined and contained.  This would enable you to re-use them in future projects, or when you build your framework later at some point.",1216043551

If you're a lefty who furthermore hooks your hand over to write, well...</i><p>This occurred to me while reading through the theory book.  What if you made a pen that, instead of continuing straightly from the handle into a tip, curved inward?  It seems to me the real difference between writing left handed and right handed is that lefties have to push and righties can drag.<p>If the tip of your pen curved inward, lefties could do a lot more dragging (and maybe all dragging, if you held the pen right).",1216042915

I'm working on a contract like that right now, and our ""lead developer"", so to speak, is doing exactly this (i.e., do BDUF, write the framework first, and I'll get to your application when I get to it).  The money quote that really stood out to me:<p><pre><code>  Frameworks are better harvested from several applications \n  that ended up using similar patterns.</code></pre>",1216042721

There have been no good stores for mobile applications, that is true. But that seems independent from the just one store problem. If there was one trustworthy store for applications, the other bad stores would be irrelevant.<p>It also remains to be seen how good the iPhone Appstore will really be. Why should it be better than the other stores for mobile applications out there?<p>Also, wasn't there a store for Palm Pilot applications from Palm Computing back in the day?",1216040775

For java and php the frameworks are too big and cumbersome so people build their own 'frankenstacks' to get away from the code bloat that comes from programming with a c style static language (talking about java here) for a generic problem, and focusing the framework for the current problem at hand. I'm not a good framework programmer so I'm perfectly happy using rails and trying to forget all crappy PHP based frameworks I've built myself in the past. :)",1216040563

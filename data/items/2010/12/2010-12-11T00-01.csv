For example, car manufacturers did almost everything by themselves 30 years ago in France, and they know depend a lot on ""equipementier"" (not sure what the right English translation would be - this refers to companies like  Faurecia, which make seat, etc...).

The Goldman Sachs risk system is called SecDB (securities database), and everything at Goldman that matters is run out of it. The GUI itself looks like a settings screen from DOS 3.0, but no one cares about UI cosmetics on the Street. The language itself was called SLANG (securities language) and was a Python/Perl like thing, with OOP and the ORM layer baked in. Database replication was near-instant, and pushing to production was two keystrokes. You pushed, and London and Tokyo saw the change as fast as your neighbor on the desk did (and yes, if you fucked things up, you got 4AM phone calls from some British dude telling you to fix it). Regtests ran nightly, and no one could trade a model without thorough testing (that might sound like standard practice, but you have no idea how primitive the development culture is on the Street). The whole thing was so good, I didn’t even know what an ORM really was until I started using Rails and had to wrestle with ActiveRecord. The codebase was roughly 15MM lines when I left, and growing. I suspect my retinas are still scarred by the weird color blue SecDB was by default. """,1292028321

1993774,comment,1992433,1993239,0,0,pocoloco,,,"The linux drivers idea is good particularly if you want to learn about communication with embedded system. But there are other approaches too.
You'll need to ask yourself how low-level do you want to go. For example:<p>Do you want to work on a system that has an OS, utilities, filesystem, etc such as the ELDK[1]?
Or a little more stripped down with only the OS such as FreeRTOS[2], uClinux[3], or uC/OS[4]?
Or even lower and use no OS at all. Use instead a foreground-background system--basically a forever loop.<p>Another way of doing this is to select the hardware first according to what you would like to do. You must keep in mind that you will most likely not have access to all the debugging tools that you're used to. This translates into very expensive compilers and debuggers for the high end hardware. But these days it seems that there is something for every taste and wallet.<p>Two particular development kits that come to mind are Arduino boards [5] and TI's MSP430 development kits [6]. I find the wireless watch development kit [7] particular interesting. I haven't used either.<p>If you see something that you like, try to find the corresponding  development kit that comes with a development board, cables, and software.<p>A good place to start is by checking DIY or hacker magazines such as Make[8].<p>I hope this gives you an idea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/ELDK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/ELDK</a>

But seeing as my other comment today is about how I may not have fully recovered mentally from a debilitating disease, I have to doubt myself.<p>Anyway, aren't you forgetting that most of the time is spent at a lower speed, so that you want to integrate the acceleration rather than simply multiplying by the escape velocity?<p>d = 1/2 at^2, where t = escape velocity / 3 G?<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=escape+velocity+%2F+3gs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=escape+velocity+%2F+3gs</a>

d = 2100 km (1300 miles)<p>While we're at it, I'm not sure what we really should be using for escape velocity.   We should probably account for the deceleration after we leave the muzzle while still in the atmosphere.  And if we presume a surface mounted rail gun, we'd probably want the escape velocity for a launch aimed just above the horizon, which involves more of this.[1]<p>Or if we're somehow presuming vertical, we'd want the escape from that height. But if vertical, we'd have to account for the extra gravitational force on the passengers, unless this is already accounted for in the human limits.  In any case, I'm not sure that the speed of the Space Station (or the surface velocity I used above) really makes sense here.<p>[1] I vaguely recall that ignoring air resistance, the velocity is the same regardless of direction, but I don't have confidence in this, and my quick searching hasn't turned up anything definitive.

The trouble isn't that you can't write a fun game in a few thousand lines of a high-level language — after all, lots of kids spend plenty of time playing Tetris and Bejeweled and so on, which you can implement in a lot less than a couple thousand lines of code — but rather that a randomly chosen game is unlikely to be accessible this way.  There are two obstacles.<p>First, you can always make the game better by adding more code. In 1979, that wasn't the case, because you could easily make the game too big to fit in memory.  So even though you can make a playable, enjoyable game in 50 or 100 lines of code, you can make it noticeably more fun in 1000 lines of code, and marginally better than that in 10 000 lines.<p>Second, most games, especially casual games, aren't distributed in source-code form at the moment. Seebs had the good fortune to be working on Unix, where people distributed things in source because it was the easiest way to make them runnable on everybody else's Unix system. JS has the same advantage, but with Flash and Win32 and Linux, it's easier for users to run your code if you distribute an inscrutable binary than if you distribute the source code. So that's what game authors do.",1292025927

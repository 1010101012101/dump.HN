First, realize you have been affected by the way the java enterprise world works. Proof is the list of frameworks and technologies that you felt you needed to disclose, also is the fact that you are looking for the ""cool tech"". Don't see these technologies as merit badges you collect, learn to look at things at a larger scale, how they compare, how they fit together, how they help you solve problems. Get really good at finding the right fit and learning the technologies quickly. Don't focus too much on the puzzles, unless you find them entertaining.<p>As for the finding an itch to scratch, its easier if its your own but its better if its one many people share, even better if its one technology people usually don't have.

People expect e.g. gold to continue to be money-like mostly because of its multi-thousand year history as money. So in that very large respect, gold is quite different from bitcoin.<p>I am interested in bitcoin, though, because of the obvious fact that it has something that neither gold nor dollars, euros, etc. have - it can be used anonymously over the internet. So it's <i>possible</i> to see it becoming popular enough to be ""money"", which is something important you can't say about something that is merely scarce.

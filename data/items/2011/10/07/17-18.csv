There are satellite dishes all over the place in both urban and rural areas all over the country.  (Suburban too, but there they're often in backyards and harder to see.)  They may be sparser than in Europe, I don't know, but they exist in America and are not rare.<p>o American cities have <i>lots</i> of churches.  A much higher percentage than in Europe are low-church Protestant (and thus without the eastern alignment) or constructed in the last half-century or so (and thus without the eastern alignment), but I think the overall percentage of buildings that are churches is actually higher.  It's certainly not radically lower.<p>o The idea that nothing in the US is older than 20 years is clearly meant to be an exaggeration, but it goes beyond mere hyperbole; in any city there are a few buildings that are almost as old as the city itself and plenty others that are a lot older than 20 years.  New stuff too, but there are old buildings.<p>o Semi-true, but in the parking-garage cities the crowds would be moving in no clear single direction, right?  Anyway, there are many cities with at least some subway/tram/commuter rail system, not just NY.<p>o Even in the grid cities, the expressways tend to be radial, and they do point toward a heavier ""downtown"" area.

Many of the issues that you point out as problems are actually ""features"" that a VM like Java doesn't provide.  For example, Java doesn't have uninitialized variables on the stack, and LLVM does.  LLVM is capable of expressing the implicit zero initialization of variables that is implicit in Java, it just leaves the choice to the frontend.<p>Many of the other issues that you raise are true, but irrelevant when compared to other VMs.  For example, LLVM allows a frontend to produce code that is ABI compatible with native C ABIs.  It does this by requiring the frontend to know a lot about the native C ABI.  Java doesn't permit this at all, and so LLVM having ""this feature"" seems like a feature over-and-above what high-level VMs provide.  Similiarly, the ""conditionally"" supported features like large and obscurely sized integers simply don't exist in these VMs.<p>The one key feature that LLVM doesn't have that Java does, and which cannot be added to LLVM ""through a small matter of implementation"" is verifiable safety. Java bytecode verification is not something that LLVM IR permits, which you can't really do in LLVM (without resorting to techniques like SFI).<p>With all that said, I do think that we have a real issue here.  The real issue is that we have people struggling to do things that a ""hard"" and see LLVM as the problem.  For example:<p>1. The native client folks trying to use LLVM IR as a portable representation that abstracts arbitrary C calling conventions.  This doesn't work because the frontend has to know the C calling conventions of the target.<p>2. The OpenCL folks trying to turn LLVM into a portable abstraction language by introducing endianness abstractions.  This is hard because C is inherently a non-portable language, and this is only scratching the surface of the issues.  To really fix this, OpenCL would have to be subset substantially, like the EFI C dialect.<p>> LLVM isn't actually a virtual machine. It's widely acknoledged that the\n> name ""LLVM"" is a historical artifact which doesn't reliably connote what\n> LLVM actually grew to be. LLVM IR is a compiler IR.<p>It sounds like you're picking a very specific definition of what a VM is.  LLVM certainly isn't a high level virtual machine like Java, but that's exactly the feature that makes it a practical target for C-family languages.  It isn't LLVM's fault that people want LLVM to magically solve all of C's portability problems.<p>-Chris",1318009957

Leading the way to the future.<p>The BMW i8 Concept is not only fast and extremely fuel efficient, it also leads the way in innovative vehicle light technology.. For the first time BMW introduces as part of the BMW i8 Concept the newly developed Laser Light. Headlights that are more efficient than LED lights, highly flexible, ten times smaller, pleasant to the eye and absolutely safe.\nBMW i8 Concept Laser Lights<p>By definition, laser lighting is radically different from sunlight, and also from the various types of artificial lighting in common use today. Laser lighting is monochromatic and it is also a ""coherent"" light source. As a result, laser lighting can produce a near-parallel beam with an intensity a thousand times greater than that of conventional LEDs. Also, the high inherent efficiency of laser lighting means that laser headlights have less than half the energy consumption of LED headlights. Simply put, laser make the BMW i8 Concept even more efficient.<p>The intensity of laser light poses no possible risks to humans, animals or wildlife when used in car lighting. Amongst other things, this is because the light is not emitted directly, but is first converted into a form that is suitable for use in road traffic. The resulting light is very bright and white. It is also very pleasant to the eye and has a very low energy consumption.<p>A further feature of laser technology, which has important implications, is the size of the individual diodes. This opens up all sorts of new possibilities when integrating the light source into the vehicle. These size advantages could be used to reduce the depth of the headlight unit, and so open up new possibilities for headlight positioning and body styling.""",1318009668

E.g.:\n`echo 'fubar' | perl -lpe 's/fu/foo/'`<p>It might be a few milliseconds slower-- for example, commenting every line of my 352-line .zshrc (via s/^/#/) takes 0.007s total with Perl (so does `s/^/#/ unless /^\s*#/`) and 0.005s with sed. Commenting out every line of /usr/share/dict/american-english (98569 lines) takes 1.124s with Perl and 0.813s with sed.<p>Since I already know how to do more complicated things with Perl (like conditionals, named backreferences, etc.) it doesn't seem worth it to take the time to learn how to use sed effectively. I can wait the extra second since I'm not on any kind of deadline or under any efficiency constraints.<p>I am not trying to say that Perl is better than sed or any other text processing tool. I also don't mean to imply that speed is sed's only advantage-- it's just one example. I think that for someone who already knows some Perl, learning another similar tool doesn't make sense. I'm sure there are exceptions. This is only my humble, personal opinion.<p>For people who do need/want to learn sed, the article did a pretty good job of showing you how to get a lot done without a whole lot of reading.",1318008361

Standard blocks, of 100 addresses each, are roughly 1/8th of a mile long. (Hence, a mile is equivalent to a street number difference of 800.) Each street is assigned a number based on its distance from the zero point of the address system, the intersection of State Street and Madison Street. A street with a W (west) or E (east) number runs north-south, while a street with a N (north) or S (south) number runs east-west. A street's number is usually written on street signs at intersections, below the street name. Major thoroughfares are at each mile (multiples of 800) and secondary arteries at the half-mile marks. Thus, Western Ave at 2400 W is a north-south major thoroughfare, while Montrose Ave at 4400 N is an east-west secondary artery.<p>In general, ""avenues"" run north-south and ""streets"" run east-west.""\n- <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Chicago"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikitravel.org/en/Chicago</a><p>General\n- <a href=""http://www.chicagohomeestates.com/info/chicago_street_guide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chicagohomeestates.com/info/chicago_street_guide</a>",1318008092

The problem is that there are almost never signs to tell you which way to turn to stay with the street you're on, or even that the street does, in fact, continue.<p>Even with a GPS, DC can be hard to navigate because there are so many discrepancies between most map databases and the actual streets.  For example, I have a relatively recent Garmin, and every time I'm in DC it tries at least once to turn me the wrong way down a one-way street, or tries to send me down a street that isn't there.  The one-way streets aren't alternated logically like the ones in NW Portland, either; there may be some rhyme or reason to the one-ways, but I have yet to decipher it.

There's no shortage of people telling him how to moderate his message to attract more, yet he won't do it. I think this is another thing people are going to grudgingly acknowledge he was right about, after a decade or twobut that might have happened more quickly if not for the harsh delivery.",1318007323

I mean, Stallman can really preach about free software all he wants, but most people in the consumer world probably wont turn down a superior closed source product based on that merit alone. The biggest factor in deciding winners or losers here is the quality of the products being created by the two methodologies, and I am yet to be convinced that the free software approach consistently creates the better product.",1318007285

It just works, or it's defective so I replace it. Most people aren't geeks and shouldn't be forced to be.<p>This is exactly why Apple is anti-hacker.<p>>Hollywood doesn't force us to take stage acting classes just to watch a movie. We shouldn't make using the Internet something one needs a class for.<p>Yet we spend years learning how to operate the human machine. Yet more years learning how to communicate with other humans. Learning how to use a pen. How to walk. How to read, write and do math. How to ride and repair a bike. If the internet is considered a basic essential utility by the UN then why should people not be educated on it as they are with math? Why should this class of tools require no learning when all other tools do?<p>To go off on a slight tangent, why is it so widely accepted that everything should be easy and require no thought? Since when do we celebrate ignorance? Did I miss a memo? There is a clear benefit to understanding your tools which is that they become more effective. Not to mention that one is also able to fix and tailor them to one's needs. We're getting extremely efficient and at the same time incredibly stupid. Should the house of cards fall down, not many will know what to do. Anyway, this goes back to the trade-off between efficiency and robustness. I feel that we are too far in the former direction.<p>>Do you know what this site is about? It's largely about entrepreneurship. Steve did what we all dream of: he followed his dream and managed to change the world. Did he solder every chip, carve out ever piece of plastic by hand? Of course not. No one man could do all those things. But it was his vision and he did what it took to make it happen.<p>Like I said, I respect his entrepreneurship but, personally, I think that it's foolish to idolize a businessman, or anyone who makes greed their life, for that matter. There are countless people more deserving of this level of attention.",1318007027

Will the film be freely available to the public? What copyrights do you plan to reserve?<p>- Could you give a better breakdown of the budget? How much is going to be spent on what? Are you really going to pay someone like Johnny Depp a ridiculous sum to do the narration?<p>- Are there any past projects by this team or individuals in this team that you could point us to?<p>EDIT: keithcu is responding to these points over on reddit: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/14s7rf/software_wars_fundraiser_a_movie_about_oss_linux/c7fytkc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/14s7rf/software_wars_...</a>",1355414399

Does anybody in the halls of power seriously think that Soviet style central planning is a good idea anymore?<p>But the real reason that nobody pays too much attention to Hayek is that the way countries recovered from the Great Depression worked entirely counter to Hayek's predictions.  Going off the gold standard worked.  It worked <i>really well</i> for every country that tried it!  The way that the events of the 1970s conclusively disproved paleo-Keynesianism.<p>So now we have neo-Keyesianism as endorsed by people like Krugman and Monetarism from people like Friedman and they agree about a lot more stuff than Hayek and Keynes did.  Now, they use different terms and have different ideas about the transmission mechanism by which monetary and fiscal policy influences aggregate demand, but everybody these days thinks of aggregate demand as the thing that drives fluctuations in the business cycle.  That's progress, maybe in another 100 years economics will be a real science.<p>And please don't take the talking heads that show up on TV seriously.  Mainstream reporting of economics is just as bad as it is of every other technical field.",1355414357

Then I realized. In Cincinnati, and probably the midwest as a whole, people do generally have more a sense of community and are more forward about ""helping"".<p>But this doesn't apply to business or startup ventures. They'll help you pick up groceries that you dropped or hold doors open for you. But when it comes to providing support for someone that's doing an entrepreneurial venture it's almost non existent.<p>The support is there at first, but when things get really tough the fact of the matter is most people haven't gone through that and can't relate.<p>It's frustrating as I believe we'll eventually end up back here to be close to my wife's family.<p>I talk to a lot of people here who speak of it being a great place for technology entrepreneurship.

4916208,comment,4915328,4915715,5,0,discreteevent,,,"I agree - ""Mathematics, in the end, does not help you understand computer programming. It is not about finding metaphors, or understanding fundamentals that will never be applied. Rather, mathematics is a tool for understanding phenomena in the world."" - I couldn't agree more with this. I come from an Electrical Engineering background originally. We did a lot of applied mathematics (in the sense of the article). One year we had a lecturer from the mathematics department who didn't really have a clue about the kind of mathematics an engineer needs. He spent a lot of time proving the most basic/fundamental things, nearly down to the level of 1+1=2. My attitude at the time was ""OK that's interesting but so what? I don't need it to get things done in the real world"". Its the same thing with the lambda calculus or type theory for me. ""OK I get the idea - so what"". Its not really of any use to me. Its probably of very little use to anyone except programming language designers and there are very few of them. Its kind of disheartening to me then to see such a focus on these things, article after article. To me it seems that the field is very inward looking in this sense.<p>For me code is just a tool for modeling/solving problems in the outside world. It is the outside world that is interesting. I think the emphasis in the article is the right one. If more people focused on applied mathematics rather than category theory then we probably would get more innovation. Eric Evans said something similar in Domain Driven Design ""Instead, the technical talent goes to work on elaborate frame-works, trying to solve domain problems with technology. Learning about and modeling the domain is left to others. Complexity in the heart of software has to be tackled head-on. To do otherwise is to risk irrelevance.""<p>One problem though is that I do like lisp and its lineage (smalltalk etc). Had to take fortran years ago. Never really liked it.",1355414112

While I definitely think aggregation is a valuable service, it has never been able to hold a candle to distribution.  Without distribution, a work could only be sold or acquired in extreme geographic proximity to where it was created.  Distributing it far and wide is what creates the entire market, and makes it possible for publishers to exist.  Once anyone at all is able to distribute things far and wide, however, that's no longer valuable and the publisher will hopefully simply go away.  As for aggregation, there are 2 issues I see with seeing this as very valuable - first, publishers are terrible at it.  See the book ""A Drunkard's Walk"" for some statistics on the matter, but the bottom line is that no one in publishing is capable of telling the difference between what will be a success or a failure.  9 publishers passed on the Harry Potter series before one 'took a chance' on it.  It's not really their 'fault' exactly, it's just that the public responds to entertainent products randomly and anyone who claims to have noticed a pattern in the noise is a (usually self-deluded) charlatan.  So, from that aspect, publishers cannot offer anything superior to what anyone else can offer.  Secondly, machine-learning-based recommendation systems such as Amazon, Netflix, etc have completely automate the aggregation process and reduce the value of aggregation nearly as much as the Internet has reduced the value of distribution.<p>>They also give them a soapbox that has a big stamp on it that reads, 'trust us, she's a great writer. All this stuff is true.'<p>If there were evidence that publishers had an accuracy rate greater than random chance at this (there isn't), this would certainly be something they could profit from.",1355412058

My pet policy issue is spectrum management (allocation of radio frequency ranges). Its a subject that lends itself to ""neat"" economic arguments. Ronald Coase wrote an instrumental paper in 1959 suggesting we should propertize spectrum and allow trading, which would lead to efficient allocations. It saddens me how many policy papers I see from ""think tanks"" that completely ignore the second part of that paper, as well as Coase's earlier work: the efficient allocation assumes that trading spectrum has negligible transaction costs. This works for say big TV stations in a city, not so much for say allocating spectrum for personal wireless devices. In my research for a seminar paper, I came across people who really should know better who ignored crucial features of the problem domain, ignored transaction costs, ignored considerations of lock-in, etc.<p>I'm tremendously skeptical of economics-based policy papers.

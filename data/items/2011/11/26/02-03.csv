In 1875 Matthew Webb made the crossing in under 22 hours (5 hours attributed to fighting the tides) and getting a jellyfish sting along the way.<p>Kutral Ramesh at 13 became the youngest person to cross the English Channel, prior to this he crossed the Palk Strait 53km wide at its narrowest. In the same year, he completed a total of 6 channel crossings, the last of which was the Ten Degree Channel, which is an approximate 150km swim.<p>If a 13 year old can swim 60km of ocean, I guess adults could have certainly made the 60km stretch.

They also managed to defeat piracy of their games with a platform that has proven surprisingly tough to crack.  I remember when Steam used to garner almost as much hate as others' DRM, but its been several years.  My friends used to be very vocal about hating how much memory it used and that you couldn't move it from one harddrive to another or back it up.  Those things were eventually solved though.  I wonder if popular opinion favoring valve is more due to these being solved, the fact that steam has been around so long and we got used to it, or the goodwill garnered from good games and/or good offers on games.",1322275987

It isn't hard to assume that people who can make arrow heads could make a harpoon head (essentially a big arrow head that can have a line tied through it and was often unattached to the spear portion - as you wouldn't want the wooden pole pulling the harpoon out).<p>My guess would be that if they were using wooden harpoons or stone/bone, they wouldn't likely be left unused. A harpoon would be kept with the fishing equipment, not with the cooking utensils, and with a line attached you'd make sure they were out and ready for the next day rather than leave them in.<p>I often don't get the logic of the researchers here in that they always seem surprised no tools were found.

Android prompts once for permissions, per app, and that's it.<p>iOS does a per-capability request of the user, at run-time.<p>To some degree I like that; sometimes an app needs a permission (say, reading the crash log) in 1% or less of runs. It would be nice to be able to dynamically request a permission.<p>If every ad network could push their own (signed!) ad-serving app, then it wouldn't be TOO bad. The system is in place on Android to ask for another app to handle a service, after all, so it's just the ""auto-install dependencies"" feature that's missing. And that feature is needed by some existing apps already as well.<p>I also grab an announcement message when my games start, though, so I can push out announcements when appropriate. And soon I'm likely to be downloading new levels in my games. So I wouldn't be able to get rid of INTERNET permission.<p>The PROBLEM, of course, is that now you've got users downloading an AD app, so if it wasn't explicit before that it's the ad provider that's tracking your position, your contacts, etc., then now it is.<p>This would give a huge advantage to the dominant ad providers, and raise barrier-of-entry to newer providers, because if a provider is already installed on 85% of phones, then it's lower-friction to install the app that uses that provider.",1322274524

3278859,comment,3278627,3278795,11,0,craigmc,,,"Over a 2-3 year period I have observed (by dint of having a frequently outranked legitimate site) probably in excess of a hundred websites run by counterfeiters (of brand name products) reach top positions for a small set of related and highly competitive terms only using overt blackhat techniques like blog comment spam, injection of links into compromised joomla, wordpress, & image hosting scripts, negative margins on divs and marquees - even white text on white backgrounds (like it was 1997).<p>The sites are removed when either law enforcement agencies or the rights owner take action (for example page 1 of the results for one term is,right now, showing 12 DCMA complaint notices, and have been a couple of fairly large scale operations by UK police to get domains taken down when there is proof of criminal acitivity).<p>If it were a handful or even a score, then I'd believe that ""Google is able to detect and disregard the vast majority of hacked links"".  However, my personal experience suggests that whatever is left after this ""vast majority"" still constitutes an awful lot of links.<p>Of course, I am not arguing that Google is not able to detect a meaningful percentage of hacked links, and indeed I have direct experience of this.<p>My own site was compromised a few years back, i.e. hacked to serve a bunch of links to the usual suspects - porn, drugs and Australian footwear (using a particularly nasty script that inserted the links only when the visitor was Googlebot otherwise it just returned an empty div - 100% my fault for being tardy in my patching schedule as it was using a widely available cms script) and this led to my site (as the 'victim' site) dropping dramatically in rank, only to recover once I had cleaned up the mess, patched the exploit and completed a re-inclusion request.<p>However, that so many sites using basic link spam approaches were able to rank so highly for such a sustained period suggests that the current capabilities are far from perfect - right now I can see a site in position 2 that only uses blog spam, is fairly new and is selling illegal counterfeit products. It simply should not be there (outranking the brand website), nor should the other 5 similar sites also on page 1.<p>Anyway, I obviously appreciate that Google faces an insanely difficult task in dealing with web spam, and the situation I refer to above is (despite the current spate) a lot better than it was 2 years ago, when it was crazily out of hand.  Nevertheless, tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds have been lost by consumers to these sites in the same period (most of whom have such a high level of trust in Google as a brand that they rightly believe that anything showing up on page 1 is likely to be legit).",1322273135

4237996,comment,4237213,4237932,2,0,Jach,,,"Oh, certainly the NSA is monitoring a lot and trying to monitor more, but my pedantic side had to call out the ""EVERY single thing"". :) Thanks for the link though, I had forgotten the details of that case and only vaguely remember hearing about the Obama administration's move to dismiss it. (Which is funny, because presently a common criticism is that Obama keeps blaming his predecessor for everything wrong. He doesn't seem very keen on prosecution...)<p>It's easy to future-proof your encryption, even in the face of exponential increases in computing power. The biggest danger to encryption systems that rely on integer factoring (i.e. RSA) right now is feasible quantum computing, but there are schemes that don't rely on factoring so there's hope on that front. For the trivial stuff I bother encrypting, I'm more worried about, in increasing order, being given the choice of decrypting something or getting shot or sent to prison for life (fortunately we have some precedent in the US and elsewhere against this), being tortured for a while without knowing why before being asked to decrypt something, and being tortured without having any information but being unable to convince the torturer of that.",1342148226

4237959,comment,4237213,4237803,15,0,samstave,,,"Wrote this some time ago:<p>---<p>It started innocently enough. Everyone is on it. Everyone. In the more than 20 years since it was founded - and now - daily life just could not be managed without it. Sure, it started innocently enough. Connect with your friends, post your pics, keep up with the fam. Yeah, that was then.<p>It wasn't too long before they started adding features. Adding value they called it. Extending your circle. Enabling you they'd say. Yeah, in the same way a spiders web is beautiful. The pattern and symmetry, glistening like shiny gossamer art. Its beauty pulls you in - you don't realize at first as you touch it, that it sticks. No, more than sticks - you become imbued with it. The more you move it wraps around you, encasing you... entombing you. For the data-mining black widow to come and suck the marketable value right out of you, your connections... every aspect of your life is now a product.<p>Classified, organized, tagged, sorted, tracked, pegged, followed, poked, monetized, labeled... owned is what you are. A commodity. A small spec among 3.5 billion in the user base of the book.<p>That's what it was these days... just simply 'the book'.<p>Everyone knows - everyone is aware. They are all in the book. Not even a page, or a word either... more like a letter. A single letter. An iconographic digital hologram of the total sum of your parts - all wrapped up real nice in a uniform singular profitable little package called your user profile. Displayed and viewed and consumed and tracked billions of times over. With more than thirty trillion page views per month, the cancerous blue and white digital encapsulation of the human soul was now blazoned across innumerable screens as nearly half the worlds population interacted on the book - more than 20% of the worlds population on the book at any given moment.<p>A study, one of the countless to be sure, said that now more than 90% of real human interactions occurred through the book. What does that even mean anymore... real? Real human interactions? Through the book? how is that even possible.
It was no wonder that in the last few years the backlash has switched to resisting this unexpected strangle-hold on the human condition. Most never saw it coming... happily going along with every new feature update, privacy change, ""enhancement"". MZ was repeating himself a lot these days... except his frame of reference had gotten bigger... along with his security detail.... Where years ago, the book was likened to that which only came along to change humans interactions every 100 years... now his statements were 10 fold. MZ thinks of himself as the embodiment of the singularity... whatever that means. Some fucking fantasy of a long dead cybervisionary that couldn't recognize the makings of our current prison I'm sure. Fuck him.<p>Looking around looks a lot more like binary slavery than any form of singularity. None of our old problems have been solved - in fact the book has only made things worse. After it became a ""platform for governance and outreach"" we, people like - those who really see, knew. We knew what this meant. Game fucking over.
This era of hyper connectivity and ultra social awareness was supposed to usher in some sort of Utopian orgasm -- one in which MZ would be carried on the shoulders of the masses to stand next to fantastical human saviors like Jesus. Fictional allusions to stellar bodies be damned!<p>The only problem is that most of the world is too busy. Feeding their attention into the black hole of the book to notice... or care I guess.<p>With ubiquitous access thanks to the assimilation of the largest global fiber network a few years ago, the book was now able to offer complete and total ""free"" access via the acquired goog-net.<p>Years ago, when Athena rolled out - it was a huge success. Welcomed into every neighborhood - direct, very high speed fiber access in every home was quickly made into a ""right"". The model was seen as our manifest destiny, held in a 62-micron translucent hair that fed us with more 1' and 0's to each person in a single day than the entire digital output of the globe in 1999.
Such an umbilical cannot be bad right!<p>The only problem is we misjudged the direction of the flow!
Now, with goog-net reaching everywhere, but the book being the only lens into the tubes -- our minds are warped. We are a most technically advanced - yet wholly dependent child-like civilization.<p>A mutant.<p>If its not on the platform. Not ""in the book"" they say -- how can it be trusted - how could it succeed? How can you expect to be relevant?<p>HOW CAN IT NOT BE RELEVANT!<p>Slaves! All of them!<p>This is why we act! This is what is needed. Who are we? Who the fuck were we? Not this! Surely not this. It is time.... We take action now. Rewrite this so called book.",1342147329

I understand that it costs money to do these things, but setting up a firewall is relatively cheap, significantly less than the cost of the additional cleanup if the breach is not contained.<p>Security, in a way, can be compared to insurance.  Sure, if you are young and live a healthy life style you may not necessarily see the need to spend $100+ a month for a health insurance policy, you can save a bunch of money... but if an accident does happen, you can rest assured it will cost you <i>significantly</i> more than if you had just bought the insurance in the first place.<p>This, in a sense, is the security tradeoff.<p>I think really smart engineers who are well versed in security can know where security needs to be, and yes it is possible to go overboard, but I think this is the exception rather than the rule.

As I recall, jrockway specified 20 minutes content, 10 minutes ads.  It's plausible to call ten fifty percent of twenty, leading to his unfortunate grammar vs math, but that wasn't his point.<p>Btw, per Wikipedia, ""a typical 30-minute block of time now includes 22 minutes of programming and eight minutes of advertisements"", making it quite clear as I also used the terms, that ""programming"" is <i>not</i> ""ads"".<p>Using the wiki terminology, that's a 30 minute block of <i>time</i>, 22 minutes of <i>programming</i>, 8 minutes of <i>ads</i>. So, contrary to your assertion a couple comments up, programming and ads and time were the correct words, and my application of the word ""time"" was appropriate and accurate.<p>As it happens, this topic was of interest to me as I've researched ad load periodically for my work in online video delivery.<p>A few years ago, reality programming had 17 to 18 minutes of content and 12 - 13 minutes of advertisements, while scripted shows were consistently 22 minutes of content with 8 minutes of ads.  Depending on your sampling of shows, 2:1 (20 to 10) is a reasonable average.  To be fair, total ad content has gone back down a bit since.<p>However, it's still getting worse if you include sponsored content in the shows themselves. This link:<p><a href=""http://www.marketingcharts.com/television/average-hour-long-show-is-36-commercials-9002/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketingcharts.com/television/average-hour-long-...</a><p>shows that of late night talk shows in 2009, ""the combined load of brand appearances and network ad messages in these late night shows is 29m34s per hour, or <i>49% of total content time</i>.""<p>There's your 1:1 ratio!  In any case, whether 33% or 49%, or ""36% of an average prime-time hour"", as reported above, saying that +/- 2 mins of ads undermines jrockway's double dipping claim is like an airline stewardess pushing your seat that last quarter inch forward as if it made the difference between life and death (with apologies to Seinfeld).<p>There are simply too many damn ads to be paying again for the privilege of being advertised to.  That's why I no longer subscribe to cable (that, and half the cable bill being the particular genre of reality show called ""sports"", which isn't of interest to me).  I spend my dollars  la carte.<p>TL;DR:<p>This link offers measured commercial time per television hour:<p><a href=""http://www.marketingcharts.com/television/average-hour-long-show-is-36-commercials-9002/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketingcharts.com/television/average-hour-long-...</a><p>It says late night talk shows may have advertising ""<i>49% of total content time</i>"", while commercials are ""<i>36% of an average prime-time hour</i>"".",1342146080

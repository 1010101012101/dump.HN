It uses up too much resources compared to its Windows edition. I switch between Windows(work) and Mac (personal) all the time and i have never seen anything Flash playing ""slower"" on mac.Flash makes use of GPU access (if required) not just for video playback. I assume Adobe's excuse for resource hungriness is , 'too much time marketing'?<p>#2) As  <a href=""http://www.apple.com/quicktime/guide/hd/recommendations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/guide/hd/recommendations.html</a> suggests,  without a card you are going to experience crappy playback for HD video on Quicktime,Flash plugin and everything.<p>#3)John is comparing native desktop video playback tools to a plugin that lives inside a browser.<p>Lastly.. read staunch's comment.<p>Why doesnt John have comments enabled in his blog?",1266703087

The simple truth is Silverlight has the capability to deliver the most superior quality video.

And every time this feeling came upon him, he knew that it was a signal that his life was not in order, not running smoothly.  He had experienced this many times before.  Too many times.  And he was tired of it.  But, left to his own means, he had yet to figure out a way to break out of this pattern.  He was stuck in neutral, unable to break free.  Not knowing what to do.</i><p>That's the beginning of the ""Hypno-Peripheral Processing"" audio course ""Procrastination, A Rhythmic Approach, by Dr. Lloyd Glauberman"".  If you identify with those statements, I would definitely recommend you give it a try.  I think it takes more than a few words of good advice to change something that's so deeply ingrained.  When I tried it a few years ago, the effect was immediate, and while I wouldn't ascribe it only to that, I'm definitely much less of a procrastinator today.<p>You may have some reservations about hypnotizing yourself, but it's really not the kind you see on TV.

1139536,comment,1139185,1139185,0,0,Todd,,,"Like many (most?) here, I have faced the same problem in the past and continue to. The difference is that over the past several years, I've figured out how to do it.<p>It all boils down to persistence, diligence, and work. As others have said, intelligence has nothing to do with it. Intelligence can sometimes be a negative because a) creative people often flit from idea to idea and, b) it can breed perfectionism--the killer of finishing.<p>I agree with many of the other posters (including pg) that you should start small and get a feeling for what it's like to finish. It also helps to talk well to yourself. The subconscious has a powerful sway over our feelings of self-esteem, unwitting self-sabotage, etc. Napoleon Hill and others talk about this. The self-talk can seem cheesy but it works, and completing small things gives you a foundation for this.<p>As for larger projects, there are a few important considerations. First, you must pick a project you believe in and will be willing to commit part of your life to (6 months?, 2 years?...). Next, you must be willing to put aside other ideas and projects in favor of it (mostly). As long as you are moving forward regularly, you can make exceptions, but you must have only one main project.<p>Next, you must break your project down into milestones. This is common sense and well understood if you program for a living. Each milestone has to be measurable so you can tell when you're done with it (and check it off). I know this sounds basic but the reason everyone keeps repeating it is that it works. You should also do something, however small, every day. Google Seinfeld's breaking the chain post on lifehacker for a technique to use here.<p>Finally, it helps to have a powerful motivator attached at the meta level to your project. This can be accomplished by partnering with someone. (Partnering has the benefit of helping to establish and maintain momentum. This is very important but can also be addressed through daily activity, as described above.) For me, it was hitting near bottom financially while living abroad. I had taken my family to live in Europe without the help of a company. We did it ourselves by saving and borrowing for two years--a very difficult undertaking. When this occurred, I swore to myself that I would never allow that to happen again. Every step since has been focused on the goal of financial independence. It has become an obsession. So I have a strong motivator to attach to projects. It sounds like you have a strong motivator as well. It really needs to become a daily obsession.<p>In order to feed my obsession, I read books about it and about people who have overcome similar situations. This keeps it in the forefront of my mind and week by week I'm also building a better and better knowledge base of how other people have accomplished the same thing. With this motivational force behind you, when you turn to your primary project, it's easier to move it forward a bit.<p>Surprisingly, wealth building and doing great things (building non-profits, etc.) all have very much in common. They are built by achievers. Achievers are merely people who move things forward little by little--relentlessly.",1266702046

We had folks typing forms in data-entry terminals 24x7 generating the tapes that were then fed to the bigger machine.<p>But you have an interesting idea. I wonder if there is any OS that changes memory distribution and allocation strategy according to desired power consumption on, say, portable computers.<p>The Linux kernel supports, IIRC, plug-and-play memory and processors and it could, conceivably (it it doesn't already) power up and down unused parts of the machine in order to reduce power consumption and heat dissipation. Even reads and writes to and from memory could be grouped in bursts if that could save power.<p>For instance, right now my running applications are within half of the memory, both cores are running slowly and the ethernet interface is disconnected. One memory module, one core and a network interface could be powered off without perceivable performance degradation. Also, as much data could be cached in the remaining memory so the disk could be powered down too or, and that would be interesting, spun at a lower speed.<p>Lots of interesting ideas in one lazy saturday afternoon.

We are not meant to live, work, or play alone (though some people are better at it then others). I would suggest taking a look at how you are approaching projects from the get go. Are you tackling everything worthy of being called a ""project"" all by yourself?<p>You mentioned you have a track record of shame that forces you to seek help. Why are you waiting until everything is falling apart to ask for help? Have you ever tried asking someone to help you out with a project from the beginning? I don't think there has ever been a circumstance in my life where someone has asked me for help or I have asked someone else for help and the answer has been, ""no"".<p>That's my 20,000 feet view at what I imagine might be your issue based on the very small information I know about you. You could also look into some of the other character traits that people who DO finish projects have:<p>Organization: Are you organized? Do you stay organized throughout the project or blow your load for the first week and everything is essentially in shambles the rest of the project lifecycle?<p>Planning: This is in many cases one in the same as organization, but do you plan before hand? Do you turn that planning into a list or tasks, milestones, or any other form of breaking something big down into a bunch of smaller and easier to obtain tasks?<p>Focus: Do you over extend yourself or do you focus on one thing at a time? Again, this is very closely related to organization and planning. I've often taken on too many projects and the results are never good; things are rushed, quality lessens, and every now and then a deadline is even missed.<p>Communication: Do you talk to everyone involved in the project throughout the project lifecycle? Do you set realistic expectations? How in the know is everyone involved in the project other then you? Is your process transparent to everyone else working around you? I'd highly suggest at least doing one small thing if you change nothing about your process: Pick one person at the beginning of your project, it doesn't matter who they are (in some cases this person is your boss and expects this of you anyway), and decide you are going to update them every day/week/whatever on how you are doing with said project. Even if it's a friend, it doesn't matter, the process of doing this will really help you keep things together. It almost turns into project management therapy.<p>At the end of the day however, while all of these things are great to focus on and improve on, you can't do any of this alone. People are not weak for asking for help, they are stronger, and personally I respect them much more then the lone warrior who is either too scared or too cocky to ask for help.",1266700049

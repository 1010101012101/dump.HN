These types of events attract a local market/patronage and so that&#x27;s where your market is for each User (Independent). So in terms of business models you could open your platform for free to the User (independent theatre/event/act) to add their event and take bookings and they could in turn charge local restaurants, businesses etc to advertise through them to their local market; your platform takes a commission of the advertising revenue. Some functional outcomes your app should offer Users; 1) advertise their event and take bookings (done); 2) demonstrate to local businesses the demographics of audience they are attracting to their event (you can capture this on booking-no big deal) 3) provide simple digital marketing tools for the User to promote the event and their advertisers (off the shelf integrations are fine) and 3) collect advertising revenue from participating customers.  How all this comes together is a considerable undertaking but you already have a working MVP you just need to work with Users (independents) and Customers (advertises/businesses) to get the product right for both and a businesses model that supports growth.

The newspapers don&#x27;t publish names of people who aren&#x27;t public figures who&#x27;ve done something bad not to embarrass their families.

Code isn&#x27;t going to be safer in language XYZ if developer isn&#x27;t proficient with it, no matter how awesome XYZ is. This also ties into the legacy: there&#x27;s a lot of code in C out there that you can&#x27;t simply replace. Also keep in mind that most of the &quot;safe&quot; languages depend on runtime which isn&#x27;t written in a safe language. So you&#x27;re just pushing the problem somewhere else.<p>Even pretty bare metal languages like Rust aren&#x27;t very well suited for OS development (yet) since they come with certain assumptions about memory subsystem. Which has to be implemented to be used. This is also true for C - there&#x27;s some stuff in every C standard library that has to be written in asm, once for each supported platform.<p>So the bottom line is: there&#x27;s always something underneath. You can get to a safer place by minimizing these pieces of &quot;unsafe&quot; code and writing code in something else above or, what OpenBSD does, you can abstract and isolate things away and use the tiniest possible solution for each problem and achieve safer environment by proper separation of concerns.",1437390042

9915167,comment,9913324,9914065,0,0,dalke,,,"Your first sentence is as best only partially correct. You would have to include corruption by the prosecutors, who are the ones who file the charges.<p>In any case, you have attempted to distinguish between &quot;behavior of police&quot; and &quot;problem with guns&quot;. This is impossible, as <i>everything</i> to do with police response is an issue with the &quot;behavior of police&quot;, including their response to an often armed citizenry. You can only use your argument by begging the question, and assuming that these entangled issues are easily separated.<p>Your best example, which you say is &quot;not long ago&quot;, is at 23 years old almost a <i>generation</i> ago. Your justification is even weaker than mine! You argue that an &#x27;impromptu militia&#x27; has (occasionally) helped protect property during civil unrest and therefore must be preserved. Yes, and probably somewhere a pistol butt was used to break the window of a car and rescue a baby that was trapped inside, so we have to make sure everyone has a pistol handy during hot weather.<p>Your example with the Katrina response is equally tenuous. That appears to have been an illegal order by the local police, which then lied to the courts about their actions.<p>Census records were used to round up Japanese during WWII. Do we therefore stop taking a census? Police have also illegally misused driving license information and similar records (see <a href=""http://www.copwatch.org/databaseabuse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copwatch.org/databaseabuse.html</a> ). Do we therefore stop tracking those records? The answer to those rhetorical questions is &quot;no&quot;. You haven&#x27;t explained why this example of illegal police use of the records is meaningful, other than to say that <i>no</i> records should be kept, for fear of abuse.<p>But all of this is besides the point. You said &quot;The reason we can&#x27;t talk about gun control is because both sides have problems which neither side wants to address.&quot;, but I still say that your characterization of the two sides is 1) limited, because there are more than two sides, 2) incorrect, or at least highly selective about the issues, and 3) hasn&#x27;t pointed out the issues that someone like me, who is for much more restrictive gun control, isn&#x27;t willing to address.",1437390036

There are niches in which other retailers can flourish but that, if you want to gain that sort of wallet share, you need consumers to identify you as a place that anything can be bought at a price that makes it not worth shopping around, and that you can&#x27;t grow into that role, because at any smaller scale, Amazon can (and has shown that it will) outcompete anyone with those ambitions. It&#x27;s risky, and nobody would even consider it if capital wasn&#x27;t extremely available at the moment, but if you genuinely believe that they could become a viable Amazon competitor in the retail space, then burning a few hundred million acquiring customers and making a name for yourself in the process doesn&#x27;t seem so irresponsible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/3017856-amazons-profitable-retail-business"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seekingalpha.com/article/3017856-amazons-profitable-r...</a>",1437390036

He was getting about $5000 a month from the sale of a small travel company he sold to the co-founder.<p>Once he figured out what would work (and that took awhile after a few missed tries) he had his market and intial funding based upon a really bad working demo I created (that would break when more then 1 person was using it at a time and I would have to reboot the server after about 5 minutes or so).  The intial funding came from the customers who were going to use it.  There were 40 and each paid $3,000.  That was enough money to hire some very inexpensive ""programmers"" from a local trade school and we were able to upgrade the demo into a full product.<p>The company is doing just fine, has 4000 monthly subscribers, I am making him a new product and I believe he will double the number of subscribers.<p>I did just read the article :)  But I am familiar with bootstrapping. On my own I am about to release ""OfficeZilla Pro"" and pray that there is enough take up to at least pay the $500 a month hosting bill.  I am working on versions for vertical markets and one day will see it to profitability.",1214013478

They didn't inherit it.<p>My point is, you can do the exact same thing. If you have the talent, consult. Tens of thousands of developers spend their entire lives freelancing. Consulting dev work is not a crazy pipe dream. Now, instead of dropping all your 1099 wages into your bank account, create an LLC, get it an ING account, and send your money there. Hire. BANG. Now you're a business. Go do something cool.",1214011622

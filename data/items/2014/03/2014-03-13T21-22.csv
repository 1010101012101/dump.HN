This isn&#x27;t a big problem, but it makes you wonder how we plan this, and why we plan this.<p>When you raise this at retros, what sort of response do you get?

7395404,comment,7389940,7390103,1,0,EdwardDiego,,,"> Has it really failed?<p>It works fine for us, but we have the ideal conditions for it to - business product owners who understand that their role is to provide a prioritised backlog and clarify stories in a timely manner - and nothing else. We have an organisation that accepts that the developers will drop features from a sprint to safeguard reliability and quality. We have teams that have stable core domains so that our estimations are, for the great majority, sufficiently accurate within that core domain.<p>Every time I see a &quot;Agile is a scam / it&#x27;s dead Jim / it&#x27;s a myth&quot; post, it usually involves into someone doing something dysfunctional and then trying to justify it with &quot;But Agile!&quot; in a game of Buzzword Bingo.<p>I went to help a local government IT department that was trying to implement Scrum to get some clarity on what the hell was going on in their dev teams, and I sat in on sprint retrospectives where all the talking was done by the &#x27;product owner&#x27; - who was actually a rebranded business analyst who had no authority to prioritise backlogs. He wouldn&#x27;t stop talking either, even when I explained to him that the retro was for the team, not him.<p>To that team, Scrum was a bunch of bullshit. To me, how they were doing it was obviously flawed. That said though, ultimately, that organisation has derived value from their half-assed implementation of it. It&#x27;s shown them precisely who contributes in their IT team and who is cruising. They&#x27;ve got a few people who claim a monopoly on certain areas and jealously defend them because it makes them feel necessary and as such, safe from being laid off. Hence I had a GIS guy telling me that &quot;You can&#x27;t expect .NET developers to learn GIS!!&quot; and an ABAP developer saying the exact same thing.<p>Now that organisation faces the challenge of managing the coasters out - unlike the US of A we don&#x27;t have at-will employment.",1394747843

7395391,comment,7394879,7394879,2,0,xenophanes,,,"One thing the anti-speed-reading folks never take into account is comprehension <i>per time</i>. They always look at comprehension for one reading of the material.<p>My regular reading speed is around 220 wpm. But I can speed read or speed listen at much more than double that. Therefore, I can do TWO speed readings in less time than one slow reading.<p>So for a fair comparison, you have to look at TWO speed readings vs ONE slow reading. In that case, the speed reading might win on comprehension, even though it was behind after its first reading. Reading stuff twice improves comprehension a lot, and can still be done in less time.<p>Or if I really really care about something, I would do a slow reading and several speed readings, and I think that&#x27;s way more effective than doing multiple slow readings, for the same amount of time or less.<p>Also with speed reading I can do over 500 wpm with very good comprehension. The point where I can&#x27;t keep up mentally or with my eyes is (after a lot of practice) above 500 wpm. But my regular reading speed, if I just use Kindle app or a paper book, remains under half that.<p>I can also speed read at over 1000 wpm, for light reading but not dense philosophy. Yes comprehension drops, but two readings at 1000 wpm for light reading may still beat one reading at 500 wpm for the same material. Or FOUR readings at 1000 wpm could beat ONE slow reading, in less time.<p>It&#x27;s important to be able to read at many different speeds, and also use several skimming methods, and think of them as different tools in your toolbox, and then figure out which is appropriate for what you want to accomplish. If you always read everything the same way, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.",1394747738

Something more powerful than straight hyperlinking. Something that automates the conversion of broadcast and multicast text blocks (like forum posts) into tailored unicast ones (like private messages). Something that gives each user the background and definition set they need to interpret the content accurately. An API for people -- a PPI?<p>I really don&#x27;t know how to make this happen. Arguably it&#x27;s the sociological question of the century, the P vs. NP of human interaction. Maybe even the best first step is a platform like Saysaw. It&#x27;s hard to say.

Imagine if nobody visited or used Wikipedia directly because some other organization basically robbed of it relevancy. At first, it could be fine (Yay!

(Meta: don&#x27;t have the personnel department doing the hiring.)<p>- Get at least the basics of tools and process right. You don&#x27;t have to let people code in Lisp or Haskell, but when a candidate asks you about version control, the answer better hadn&#x27;t be &quot;oh we don&#x27;t have time for that here&quot;.<p>- If you are requiring people to work in the office, don&#x27;t quibble about things like high-spec machines and good chairs that cost a small fraction of the cost of hiring people.<p>Hit everything on that checklist and even if you&#x27;re still not quite as sought after as Fog Creek, you&#x27;ll be well out in front of most of your competitors at little cost in either time or money (and infinitely far in front of Fog Creek for any candidates who won&#x27;t or can&#x27;t live in New York).",1394746967

And if you want to avoid that your employees have to wait for their money just hand them credit cards - they don&#x27;t even have to spend their own money, expenses are approved by default - which is hopefully the common case - and just in the uncommon case of unjustified expenses you have to take actions and deduct the amount from the salary or compensate in a different way.",1394746966

My comprehension is high, and I am also excellent at &quot;skimming&quot;: reading far faster than normal to identify specific parts of the text.<p>Professionally, I teach people to do better on the law school admission test (LSAT). The exam has a section on reading comprehension. Student must read four dense passages in 35 minutes and answer questions.<p>Most students complain that they don&#x27;t have enough time. Invariably, when I test these students, they are reading 200-250 WPM. That&#x27;s half my speed! At the low end (sub-200) students actually vocalize words - their lips move when they read. Other students, who have enough time, read 280+<p>For the past  year, I have been experimenting with training students to reduce subvocalization and read faster. A sizeable minority of students report very rapid increased, perhaps 60-100 WPM within a week. Perhaps 40%.

About half report no improvement, but many of them simply don&#x27;t try the method, as they are skeptical.<p>I&#x27;m not a believer in 1000+ reading speeds, but I do think many people have a latent capacity to read better.

It&#x27;s also not very expensive, in the scheme of things.  If paying roughly $100-$250 for a Form 5471 is too great an expense, you probably don&#x27;t have the financial leeway to be making the foreign investment in the first place.<p>Also, Translating accounts is not very difficult.

One driver was a realization that jquery and related tools filled quite a bit of bulk in the platform(cutting them out the minified js ended up being 1/5th the original size).<p>Another was a conscious decision to rebuild API first and angular provided a unique ability to very cleanly abstract a View/Service/Server type of architecture that has just never worked for us in Jquery.<p>Plenty of people will continue to use JQuery just as plenty of people continue to develop in Perl despite other communities feelings that it does&#x27;t fit their use case.",1394745610

I would have thought that if the Founders intended to limit the 4th to &quot;just customs searches&quot; they would have said so?<p>The Bill of Rights were born of the same environment that gave a specific protection regarding the right to bear arms and regarding the quartering of soldiers in private homes.<p>They were in many ways a reaction to British actions prior to the American Revolutionary War and not a simple enumeration of rights. Indeed, the Federalists felt the Bill of Rights was self-evident and did not need to be duplicated in that fashion, and they added in a separate Amendment making clear that the fact that these rights were enumerated should not be construed to mean that the list of rights was exhaustive.<p>Getting back to your question then, the Fourth Amendment was a reaction to British &quot;writs of assistance&quot; that allowed customs inspectors wide-ranging powers of search and seizure to stop New England merchants from smuggling goods.<p>Indeed, if the writers of the Fourth Amendment had meant to completely foreclose the possibility of government warrantless searches then they would not have inserted the weasel word &quot;reasonable&quot; into its text.<p>So the good news is that reasonable can change over time to become more restrictive on government&#x27;s ability to search. The bad news is that until this change actually happens in the courts then it&#x27;s hard to say specifically that the government is &quot;oppressing the people&quot; just because their lawyers don&#x27;t agree with your interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.",1394745140

7395049,comment,7394104,7394104,5,0,just2n,,,"I never understood this. Parents tend to get off work around 5-6, right? Schools were so adamant, in my experience, about getting kids out of there (and sending all the staff/faculty home) by 3:30. This is at every grade level, including those where the students can not yet drive. This also means that there&#x27;s an extra need for school-provided transportation (busses). The need for more than half of the student body to ride busses feels like a huge process smell to me, both in that the city should be providing transportation and that the school is requiring students to come and go at times that are too inconvenient for <i>everyone</i>.<p>Why not, instead, shift the school end time back to 5:30? Instead of 3:15 (as it was for me, though I&#x27;m sure it varies), this adds 2 hours and 15 minutes to the day. As a result, the academic day can begin at 10:30 rather than 8:15. Labs, libraries, etc can all be open during this period to allow students to catch up on work, get help, etc if they wish to come in early (or need to due to their parents&#x27; work schedule). The cafeteria could even open on a limited basis to serve breakfast in this time. But there&#x27;s no rush to get in class by 8:15 and no need to start serving breakfast at 7 AM or earlier.<p>Then athletics can start early (say 6:30-7) instead of running excessively late. And further, the school can remain open in the same state it did for morning for these students and others who wish to stay late and work on their assignments.<p>I felt, in HS, so rushed to get in class, &quot;learn&quot; (hard to do when you&#x27;re constantly moving from room to room) and then get out and do all the work at home. Ok that&#x27;s fine, it was convenient for me since I was able to walk home in just 5 minutes, but for most people I suspect this was a horrible pressure. And for people who don&#x27;t have access to everything at home, this is also probably damaging to their ability to complete work, and likely discouraging. Not to mention distractions, etc.<p>I really liked how it was in college. Because I had to commute, I tended to stay on campus later. I didn&#x27;t have my distractions (home, games, computer, etc) with me, so I&#x27;d end up just doing my work or research. Then when I went home, I had nothing but free time. Time I spent reading articles on hacking, watching defcon videos, chatting in IRC, playing games, reverse engineering, etc. All tasks which I thoroughly enjoyed. All made possible because I had a place to work separate from my home. So the notion of &quot;home work&quot; seems broken to me. Totally broken. There needs to be work/life balance, and part of that includes a separation of &quot;home&quot; and &quot;work&quot;. I never felt that in HS.<p>I found it really strange that morning detention was incredibly productive. I had the pleasure of receiving this once in 7th grade. I brought a book and read half of it in that time. In fact, working was required, no talking. Otherwise I would&#x27;ve been just standing outside goofing off. There was no place for us to go like that at the school to be productive. We had to stand around outside until classes started. And you realistically had to do that to be on time to class. Doesn&#x27;t this seem odd?<p>Also interesting was the partial schedule I had in my senior year. I had a calculus course that began at 11 AM, which means I got to sleep in most days of the week. I would often go to school at 10 AM and go sit in the library and read or go over my work, then go to class at 11. I don&#x27;t think I ever received a B on anything in the class (sure, it was easy, but this was statistically anomalous to my other grades, I never did homework at home; I always did it on campus, and my grades reflected that, and I didn&#x27;t care because &quot;home&quot; was not a place to do work). I also got a perfect score on the Calculus BC exam and skipped multiple college courses as a result. And because of that experience, I realized I enjoyed math far more than I had previously thought and wanted to learn more, beyond Calculus, and so I ended up getting a math degree.<p>Are there actually any negatives? Sure, the pay for teachers needs to be increased to justify spending more time at school, and even more than that, it should probably be doubled or more realistically because there&#x27;s currently no economic incentive for the smartest people to teach. But that&#x27;s an existing problem.",1394744804

It doesn&#x27;t explain the need to make HS and JHS start so early, or why on earth they would start earlier than primary school when young children tend to wake up earlier than teenagers anyway.<p>7:30 for primary/elementary school and 8:30 for HS and JHS would have been great (or maybe even 8 and 9 respectively), but I suppose some kids skipping class after their parents had left for work would ruin it for everyone.<p>EDIT: How much do you think reusing the bus fleets actually saves? Compared to have one big fleet that transports all schools at the same time, you need less buses, and probably save a little by paying less drivers for more time, but I&#x27;d expect the cost of fuel to dominate, which should be about the same regardless. Operating more busses also means that each is sustaining less wear per day as well.",1394744642

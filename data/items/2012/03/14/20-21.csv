For video games it's a month or two (Starcraft 2 sold 75% of total copies told to date within the first month).

They are a fundemental advancement in packing. Up until virtualization obfuscators, all other packers had the weakness where at some point the unprotected program would end up in memory. This weakness is easily exploitable (ala VxClass, see Recon 2010 for an easily digestible talk). Virtualization obfuscators are still beatable with manual reverse engineering (see Rolles WOOT 2009) and some effort has been made to automate the process (see Wenke Lee's group at Oakland 2009).

3705137,comment,3702827,3704115,1,0,jerf,,,"A framework previously designed to work on a single device was ripped apart and several key elements were made to run over a network remotely instead. (That may sound trivial in a sentence, but if anyone ever asks you to do this, you should be very concerned.) The framework was never designed to do this (in fact I dignify it with the term ""framework""), and tight coupling and global variables were used throughout. This was not a multi-10-million line behemoth, but it was the result of at least a good man-century of work.<p>As mentioned in my other post, first I had to bring it under test as is, then de-globalize a lot of things, then run the various bits across the network. Also testing the network application. Also, by the way, releases were still being made and many (though not all) of the intermediate stages needed to still be functional as single devices, and also we desire the system to be as reverse-compatible as possible across versions now spanning over a year of releases. (You <i>do not</i> want to be manually testing that your network server is still compatible with ~15 previous versions of the client.) And there's still many other cases I'm not even going into here where testing was critical.<p>The task I'm currently working on is taking a configuration API that has ~20,000 existing references to it that is currently effectively in ""immediate mode"" (changes occur instantly) and turning into something that can be managed transactionally (along with a set of other features) without having to individually audit each of those 20,000 references. Again, I had to start by putting the original code under a microscope, testing it (including bug-for-bug compatibility), then incrementally working out the features I needed and testing them as I go. The new code needs to be as behavior-similar as possible, because history has shown small deviations cause a fine spray of subtle bugs that are really difficult to catch in QA.<p>I could not do this without automated testing. (Perhaps somebody else could who is way smarter, but I have my doubts.) The tests have already caught so many things. Also, my first approach turned out wrong so I had to take another, but was fortunately able to carry the tests over, because the tests were testing behavior and not implementation. (Also it was the act of writing those tests that revealed the performance issues <i>before</i> the code shipped.)<p>This isn't a matter of large-scale requirement changes on a given project. This is a matter of wanting to take an existing code base and add new features that nobody thought of when the foundation of the code was being laid down 5-7 years ago. (In fact, had they tried to put this stuff in at the time it would have all turned out to be a YAGNI violation and would have been wrong anyhow.) Also, per your comment in another close-by thread, the foundation was all laid down prior to my employment... not that that would have changed anything.<p>The assumption that large-scale changes could only come from changing requirements is sort of what I was getting at when I was talking about how the limitations of not-using-testing can end up internalized as the limitations of programming itself.<p>Might I also just say one more time that testing can indeed be used very stupidly, and tests with net negative value can be very easily written. I understand where some opposition can come from, and I mean that perfectly straight. It is a skill that must be learned, and I am still learning. (For example: Code duplication in tests is just as evil as it is in real code. One recurring pattern I have for testing is a huge pile of data at the top, and a smaller loop at the bottom that drives the test. For instance, testing your user permissions system this way is great; you lay out what your users are, what the queries are, and what the result should be in a big data structure, then just loop through and assert they are equal. Do <i>not</i> type the entire thing out manually.) But it is so worth it.",1331756089

If all products that were ever built were 100% good and successful, we'd be living in a different world. But, we don't. Fact is that most of us make a few good products (if we are lucky) and a lot of bad ones. It is the natural way of things, you can't control it. What you can control is how we go about doing it and how much it costs.<p>2. Money is raised for a lot of reasons. Money is spent for a lot of reasons. Not all worthy causes/products get funded well, same is the case for the unworthy ones. A lot of money, be it that most of it is wasted, tills the ground better and raises the odds for something good to come out of the flood of bad ones. Would you rather have no good ones at all in trying to ensure ONLY good ideas get funded and sustained?<p>3. You can use the same $$$s in different ways: blow it all up in one go, make different (smaller) attempts at it with clearly defined parameters for failure and success. Those two parameters are very subjective. Especially as product people we tend to keep products alive for much longer than we deserve to keep them.<p>4.

Needless to say, we were disappointed to read the assertions made by this individual that do not reflect our values, our culture and how the vast majority of people at Goldman Sachs think about the firm and the work it does on behalf of our clients.<p>In a company of our size, it is not shocking that some people could feel disgruntled. But that does not and should not represent our firm of more than 30,000 people. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. But, it is unfortunate that an individual opinion about Goldman Sachs is amplified in a newspaper and speaks louder than the regular, detailed and intensive feedback you have provided the firm and independent, public surveys of workplace environments.<p>While I expect you find the words you read today foreign from your own day-to-day experiences, we wanted to remind you what we, as a firm – individually and collectively – think about Goldman Sachs and our client-driven culture.<p>First, 85 percent of the firm responded to our recent People Survey, which provides the most detailed and comprehensive review to determine how our people feel about Goldman Sachs and the work they do.<p>And, what do our people think about how we interact with our clients? Across the firm at all levels, 89 percent of you said that the firm provides exceptional service to them. For the group of nearly 12,000 vice presidents, of which the author of today’s commentary was, that number was similarly high.<p>Anyone who feels otherwise has available to him or her a mechanism for anonymously expressing their concerns. We are not aware that the writer of the opinion piece expressed misgivings through this avenue, however, if an individual expresses issues, we examine them carefully and we will be doing so in this case.<p>Our firm has had its share of challenges during and after the financial crisis, but your pride in Goldman Sachs is clear. You’ve not only told us, you have told external surveys.<p>Just two weeks ago, Goldman Sachs was named one of the best places to work in the United Kingdom, where this employee resides. The firm was the highest placed financial services company for the third consecutive year and was the only one in its peer group to make the top 25.<p>We are far from perfect, but where the firm has seen a problem, we’ve responded to it seriously and substantively. And we have demonstrated that fact.<p>It is unfortunate that all of you who worked so hard through a difficult environment over the last few years now have to respond to this. But, our response is best demonstrated in how we really work with and help our clients through our commitment to their long-term interests. That priority has distinguished us in the past, through the financial crisis and today.<p>Thank you.<p>Lloyd C. Blankfein\nGary D. Cohn",1331755390

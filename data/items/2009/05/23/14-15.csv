623485,comment,623420,623420,0,0,tsally,,,"Am I the only person who actually wants a full and balanced education?  I got enough advanced placement credit in high school to graduate with my CS degree in three years without any extra work, but I'm taking graduate courses and studying English instead.  College isn't just vocational training, it's where you develop your interests and learn how to think.  Honestly if all you want to do is learn how to hack well, you're better off not going to college at all.<p>I agree, at the end of the day Universities are businesses.  But don't use that as an excuse to be lazy about your education.  If you are proactive and motivated, you can get your money's worth out of your school.<p>The anti-college bias in the hacker community is really unfortunate, and ultimately it stems from a misunderstanding of what type of animal college actually is.  I certainly agree that there are many talented people who do not need to go to or complete college.  However there seems to be an assumption that it is the responsibly your college to stimulate your hacker ingenuity.  Maybe that flew in your gifted classes in high school, but college is much more like the real world.  In college it's your job to find your niche  where you are intellectually simulated.<p>EDIT: And as for the complaining about general education requirements, you need to take a look at University of Chicago.  They have the strictest general education requirements out of any college and it seems to work for them.  On the other hand, if you really are against general education requirements, you should have picked your college better.  A college like Amherst, for example, has zero graduation requirements (besides a raw number of hours).  In any case, there is always a way to work the system.  Find online courses that transfer and take them.  Take a class at your local community college one night a week over the summer.  And so on...  At the very worst, accept the fact that your technical GPA probably needs padding anyway, and use GenEds to boost your GPA so you can get interviews.",1243090759

623479,comment,623420,623442,0,0,artlogic,,,"Educational institutions aren't exactly the same as businesses.  For instance, how many teenagers actually WANT to attend high school?  Looking back I can honestly say I learned some important things in high school (but then again, I took every AP class available to me and then some).<p>Colleges and universities have an interesting niche to fill.  A broad-based liberal arts education isn't just a tradition - it's actually a useful tool that can help with whatever your main task is in life.  I am a computer scientist by trade and by degree.  My degree taught me very little I wasn't already aware of as far as computer science is concerned.  The most mind blowing thing was learning Scheme, which led me to learn CL, and start looking at other functional languages.  However, my degree also taught me about art (very important for a CS person IMHO), literature, history, philosophy, biology, mathematics, physics, and more... I have hobbies outside of CS mostly because of my degree.  Most importantly, I can draw inspiration from other disciplines, because I understand the basics of many disciplines.<p>Too many people expect colleges to provide only directly relevant instructional material.  This is not what college is for.  If you only want to learn a specific trade, go to trade school.  College isn't going to get you a job, it isn't going to feel immediately useful, especially when you are young.  I had the advantage of slowly getting a degree over 8 years while working full time.  It was hard, and the first few years I whined like everyone else - but then I started to see how becoming more intellectual gave me a leg up in business and in CS.<p>Colleges don't give the students what they want, because most of them haven't a clue what they want or need to prosper in the long term.  College isn't job training.",1243090430

623476,comment,622618,622618,0,0,jpedrosa,,,"Hi. My experience lies in Ruby and in JavaScript (these days) so I can see these worlds however close, differently. In Ruby I have all kinds of gimmicks that help with cutting the chase when that's what I want, but I also can make it a little harder when I am interested in something else, in experimenting with some other approach.<p>What I find a little disgusting is when my ""meta-programming"" in Ruby starts doing things like when an exception occurs, it points to a line number slightly different than where it really is, or when the backtrace becomes all the more ""hacked"" with harder to understand things thrown in there. It serves to remind us that there are tradeoffs involved. Also there is the issue creating shareable modules and when you start hacking it away it can make it all the more harder to share. But it's more than fun, it does work, it's just that one can have mixed feelings because for ever cool finding or development, there can exist a little nuisance as well or something that you cannot quite do anymore because you deviated from mainstream...<p>I gotta go have lunch!<p>Be well.",1243090100

623474,comment,623420,623444,0,0,tallanvor,,,"There are over 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S, ranging from low cost community colleges to very expensive private schools.  That's a lot of options for people looking for an education.  New schools are still started, although not as often as before, and they are usually public schools.

623473,comment,623420,623420,0,0,tophat02,,,"Examples of classes I should not have had to take:<p>- Kinesiology (fancy term for ""PE"" and/or ""Health""): they had their chance in high school.  By college, most people know whether they're going to be ""physical"" or not.  I had to take FOUR of these, each for only 1 hour of credit<p>- ""Multi cultural studies"": politically correct indoctrination course.  By my observation, usually had the reverse effect of what was intended<p>- Political Science I & II: Just replace with a poli sci survey course.  Interested students could take more as elective or major in it<p>- Economics and Accounting: Both of these classes are incredibly theoretical, dry, and boring - unless you happen to like the subjects, in which case you're probably majoring or minoring in them.  Replace with ONE course about how not to screw up your personal financial life, since they can't be bothered to teach that in high school<p>- Physics I & II: I don't need two full semesters of physics.  Again, just give me a survey course (that's all I'll remember anyway).  The interested students can go on to learn more<p>- History I & II: We know, there's a lot of history to cover, but a whirlwind course would probably hold students' attentions more than two whole semesters<p>Oh, and, for Computer Scientists:<p>- The vast majority of people in computer science departments want to be programmers, NOT computer scientists.  I recommend splitting this major into computer science and software engineering.  Computer Science would be in the department of science and software engineering would be in the department of engineering.  For software engineering students, I would collapse most of the computer science curriculum into one or two survey courses and use the rest of the time to teach solid, modern, software engineering concepts (configuration management, working in a team, requirements gathering, design patterns, methodologies, real-world programming, etc...)",1243089877

And they were all responsive enough to be contained in a WebView. But repeating making new projects for each web app was frustrated. This is the reason why I make WebShell. It can help you make the web app you like to be a native OS X app.<p>Another frustrating thing for me is I did not even know how Cocoa framework works and did not know how to write OS X application. I learn swift-lang and learn about the concepts of Cocoa two days and then made WebShell. So I hope that everyone can make web app to be native app even though you are not (Cocoa) developer.

10769145,comment,10768859,10768933,0,0,bkanber,,,"Well, I have a biased view here. I&#x27;m a knowledge junkie and I love learning systems. In software, I _actually_ RTFM for every single tool I use even tangentially. (As a side note, reading tech documentation cover to cover is actually awesome). So instinctually my gut reaction is to say &quot;yes of course learn the system&quot;.<p>But as far as a more measured, less biased opinion goes: it depends on how professional you want to be. Most real consumer hardware doesn&#x27;t really have APIs in the same manner that arduino and other user-friendly platforms do; arduino is basically designed to make programmer hobbyists feel comfortable with hardware.<p>But real embedded systems are programmed on microcontrollers (generally, sometimes we use FPGAs or other exotic platforms) in assembly or a dialect of C. And there, you&#x27;re not so much &quot;using an API&quot; as you are manipulating output pins directly. So if you really want to work with high powered, professional platforms, you should certainly learn the stack.<p>Learning the stack is advantageous even with a friendly platform like the Arduino. At low power, most robotics are pretty easy to work with, very few surprises. But as you try and build bigger and more powerful robots, especially where motors are concerned, you start running into real electrical engineering problems (like back-EMF) that you _can&#x27;t_ fix with software. So if you aren&#x27;t comfortable with electrical engineering, the first time you attempt a more ambitious project you&#x27;ll find yourself at a brick wall that you don&#x27;t know how to get around.<p>So, unsatisfyingly, the answer seems to be &quot;it depends&quot; ;)",1450662870

Not in the general case. Solving program equivalence would also provide a solution to the Halting problem.<p>One way to prove this is as follows:<p>Given an arbitrary function, <i>f</i>, we choose a number <i>x</i> and define a function <i>f&#x27;</i>, which on input <i>n</i> returns 1 if <i>n = x</i>, and otherwise calls <i>f(n)</i>.<p>We now statically know that <i>f&#x27;</i> halts on at least one input.

That would solve the Halting problem. Thus, functional equivalence is undecidable.<p>You can design normalized forms which will tell you if <i>some</i> classes of programs are functionally equivalent or not (and it&#x27;s a darn good thing, too, or it would be impossible to do compiler optimizations), but any realizable algorithm for such must always have edge cases where it either gets the answer wrong, or has to output &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;.",1450662230

But because of the &quot;bolt-on&quot; nature of TLS, we get things like TLS terminating proxies/load-balancers etc, and a lot of passing flags in headers (ProyxN confirms that it&#x27;s relaying over plain-text HTTP on the (assumed to be) secure internal network, on behalf of clientX that&#x27;s connected over TLS <i>and</i> has been authenticated...).<p>The &quot;simple&quot; answer is to have client-certificates, and allow a client access directly to an application server over TLS, <i>or</i> use a secure transport (eg: IPSec), and just use standard HTTP auth on every pass (which AFAIK never was extended to use some form of standardized token, so one&#x27;s left with sending the actual login/password pair every time).<p>The sane compromise is to just use encrypted cookies -- but <i>they</i> are also <i>bolt on</i> solutions.<p>The problem is that essentially one needs encryption to ensure secure sessions, which essentially boil down to authenticating the client to the server, and the server to the client, and forming some kind of session (typically DH for a symmetric session key).<p>For a long while, encryption was <i>really</i> expensive compared to the db lookup and template render that &quot;every&quot; web application did -- and so we&#x27;ve ended up with a mess of &quot;best practices&quot; which aren&#x27;t very good at all (and not a very good way of moving from REST-that-trusts-plaintext-ip to REST-and-also-secure).<p>With HTTP/2 it looks like things are moving towards making the transport-protocol part do the things it should -- track the session, and secure the session.

This is because our current theories are so good, we have no idea where to look. So it begins conjecturing and conjecturing. What it ends up with is nonsensical garbage that does little to advance physics.<p>But yet, there isn&#x27;t a crisis in physics at all since these theorists are so far removed from reality, I don&#x27;t really care what they think. They don&#x27;t really tell use anything useful or interesting so I tend to ignore them. Instead, I focus on things we do know exist but cannot explain, say astrophysical jets, pulsars, or supernovas. We know they exist and we can see them, yet we understand them very little. We have models that are getting better and better over time, but they all exist within the current understanding of physics. This is where physics really is. Whatever garbage the theorists put up on the arxiv can be ignored with little loss.<p>Instead, those of us &quot;in the trenches&quot; can continue our work trying to explain observed phenomena with our current theories. There is no need to add in extra dimensions or cohomology. Maybe, when we&#x27;ve done really understanding our current theories can we talk to those theorists again.<p>Incidentally, since I started my PhD in physics doing numerical relativity, my views on science have changed completely. I used to be interested in stuff like string theory, but actually sitting down and trying to do it left me feeling empty inside. Now that I work in an area that is very closely related to observations, I feel like I am actually learning something about the universe. It&#x27;s hard to explain philosophically, but I really believe in experiments as the guiding principle of science. In my case, we see pulsars (2500+ of them) and we have yet to provide a full explanation of their nature.

Which is not the absolute consensus of logicians/mathematicians.<p>Many seem to believe they are simply about limits and that&#x27;s all, but they may also point to a more fundamental aspect of reality. E.g. from Wiki:<p><i>A suggested problem with using calculus to try to solve Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes is that this only addresses the geometry of the situation, and not its dynamics. It has been argued that the core of Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes is the idea that one cannot finish the act of sequentially going through an infinite sequence, and while calculus shows that the sum of an infinite number of terms can be finite, calculus does not explain how one is able to finish going through an infinite number of points, if one has to go through these points one by one. Zeno&#x27;s paradox points out that in order for Achilles to catch up with the Tortoise, Achilles must first perform an infinite number of acts, which seems to be impossible in and of itself, independent of how much time such an act would require.<p>Another way of putting this is as follows: If Zeno&#x27;s paradox would say that &quot;adding an infinite number of time intervals together would amount to an infinite amount of time&quot;, then the calculus-solution is perfectly correct in pointing out that adding an infinite number of intervals can add up to a finite amount of time. However, any descriptions of Zeno&#x27;s paradox that talk about time make the paradox into a straw man: a weak (and indeed invalid) caricature of the much stronger and much simpler inherent paradox that does not at all consider any quantifications of time. Rather, this much simpler paradox simply states that: &quot;for Achilles to capture the tortoise will require him to go beyond, and hence to finish, going through a series that has no finish, which is logically impossible&quot;. The calculus-based solution offers no insight into this much simpler, much more stinging, paradox.<p>A thought experiment used against the calculus-based solution is as follows. Imagine that Achilles notes the position occupied by the tortoise, and calls it first; after reaching that position, he once again notes the position the turtle has moved to, calling it second, and so on. If he catches up with the turtle in finite time, the counting process will be complete, and we could ask Achilles what the greatest number he counted to was. Here we encounter another paradox: while there is no &quot;largest&quot; number in the sequence, as for every finite number the turtle is still ahead of Achilles, there must be such a number because Achilles did stop counting.</i>",1450660057

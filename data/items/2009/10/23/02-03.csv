898178,comment,897880,898152,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> you can still learn them (and perhaps even be more objective about it) when you're not a founder.<p>I wonder, sometimes, how true that is.<p>I went into the startup world for exactly that reason: I wanted to start my own company eventually, knew that I didn't have the knowledge or experience to do it immediately, so I figured I'd learn the ropes on somebody else's dime.  I picked companies that would give me a lot of responsibility, and ones where I could directly observe what the founders did and why they did it.  And I took careful mental notes whenever something worked well or didn't work well, and resolved to do the same thing (or not do it) when I started my own company.<p>And then I actually did start my own company, and found that I made nearly every mistake that my old bosses had made, I just made them in new ways, and stopped making them a little quicker.<p>I found there're three main problems with the ""learn how to start your own company by working at someone else's company"" school of thought:<p>1.) There are many more ways to fail than there are to succeed.  Therefore, if you pick any random strategy out of a random company, and you don't yet know whether the company is failing or succeeding, it's probably a failing strategy.  Orson Scott Card once said, ""There are a million wrong ways to tell a story, and a thousand right ways.""  That's probably true of entrepreneurship too, just multiply the numbers by a few orders of magnitude.<p>2.) If you haven't yet worked at a successful company, you probably don't know how to tell the difference between a successful strategy and a failing one.  A lot of the things I respected most about my past employers turned out to be mistakes.  For example, one of them was big on code ownership, and seeing how hard coders worked at getting their code running, I thought it was a great way to encourage people to take pride in the code they produce.  Another was building a platform for financial apps, and I thought they were geniuses for their strategic insight - after all, they get recurring revenue and their customers can't easily switch away.  It was only after I tried building a platform myself that this reached the top of the list for ""things startups should never do"" - and given the number of YC startups that get funded with their own webapp platforms, I guess lots of other founders haven't yet learned that either.<p>3.) Many times mistakes don't look like mistakes, because the circumstances that surround them are different.  Very occasionally, they <i>aren't</i> mistakes, because the circumstances that surround them are different.  For example, while I was building my platform to create casual games, I thought I'd sidestep all the complexity & adoption problems my financial employer had faced, because I was purposely limiting the scope of my platform to <i>games</i> and wasn't trying to have it do everything.  I found that no, the platform part really was the problem, and no matter how much I polished it up, that approach just didn't work.",1256266659

898152,comment,897880,898017,0,0,akeefer,,,"To expand on your last point there:  if you do work for a startup, pay attention to everything, and learn from all the things that get done well and all the things that don't.  There's a lot to learn and a lot to screw up.  For example:  Did you hire well?  Did you grow the team too slowly or too quickly?  Did your development process work well?  Did it adapt as your product and team matured?  Was the management transparent in the right ways?  If the company grew, how did it handle the addition of new employees, new customers to support, and new or larger product offerings?  How was your employee retention and burnout?  And so on . . .<p>There are invaluable lessons that you can really only learn by going through those things, and you can still learn them (and perhaps even be more objective about it) when you're not a founder.<p>And if your startup isn't transparent enough that you can learn those sorts of lessons, you should consider that a major strike against it.",1256264903

898136,comment,897509,897699,0,0,patio11,,,"Sales taxes on anything -- luxury or not -- are regressive taxes on the poor, because the poor spend a higher portion of their income on consumption than the non-poor do.<p>For example, let's say we have a uniform sales tax of 5%.  A poor person with an income of $20k will spend almost all of that $20k during the year, paying 5% of her salary in taxes.  (She might even borrow money and spend more than her income, meaning relative to her income the rate increases to more than 5%.)<p>Say for the sake of argument unpoor me makes $40k and I spend $30k, saving the remaining $10k.  I pay $1.5k in taxes, more in absolute terms but less as a percentage of income (3.75%), which is the definition of a regressive tax.<p>There are other ways sales taxes tend to favor the unpoor.  For example, a poor person will typically buy almost all goods locally and thus be subject to tax on all of them.  This is not necessarily true of non-poor people -- more than half of my monthly purchases are tax-exempt because of where I make the purchase.  (For example, when I buy software from American companies, neither Japan nor my locality nor most US states tax me.)<p>There are tweaks you can make to sales taxes which make them marginally ""fairer"" to the poor: exempting food and clothing, for example, which the poor tend to spend more on as a percentage of income than the rich.  However, these tweaks get very complicated very fast (a lot of governments actually have a policy which sounds like ""Exempting food sales but taxing prepared food sold for immediate consumption unless it is take-out except taxing hot take-out.""  I wish I was joking.  My sympathies in advance to anyone who writes POS software for French bistros.)  These exemptions also tend to cost the state a lot of money, because non-poor people spend lots of money on food, clothing, etc.<p>Anyhow, long story short: sales taxes are, and must always be, a regressive tax on the poor.",1256263544

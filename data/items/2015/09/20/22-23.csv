When communication is needed async is your friend<p>2) Make sure the company respects your time(-difference).<p>If the time difference is several hours you might need to keep several evenings blocked for meetings. Make sure that those are arranged in planned manner and not on the spot and heretic.<p>3) Work from an office / coworking space<p>Personally i prefer offices because there are less distractions.

Mercedes is shipping it now. The big problem is keeping drivers from relying too much on a dumb system that almost works[1].<p>Everyone with a clue in the industry realizes the problem.   Semi-automatic driving, with the expectation that the driver is alert and ready to take over, is an accident waiting to happen.  Mercedes has a device to check if hands are on the wheel.  (See video below for someone defeating that.) Cadillac has a seat vibrator.  Most of those semi-auto systems are unable to detect junk such as a mattress on the highway, deer, pedestrians, and work crews. They  assume a benign freeway environment.  Most won&#x27;t engage in a non-freeway environment.<p>What bothers me about &quot;Cruise&quot; is that they promote this assist technology as a full self-driving system, like what Google and CMU/Cadillac have in test.  See the Cruise ad.[2]<p>The NTSB defines four levels of self-driving:<p><pre><code>    0 - manual\n    1 - Function-specific Automation \n        (example: anti-collision radar braking.)\n    2 - Combined Function Automation \n        (adaptive cruise control plus lane centering.)\n        (current Mercedes, etc. level)\n    3 - Limited Self-Driving Automation\n        (still needs a driver available to take over.)\n        (current Google level)\n    4 - Full self-driving automation\n        (driver does nothing, may not even be present)\n        (Google is trying to get there for 25MPH cars.)\n</code></pre>\nCruise is at level 2, but advertises as if at level 3.<p>Driving a level 2 car and thinking it&#x27;s a level 3 car is deadly.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9JYqhFV-M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9JYqhFV-M</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.getcruise.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getcruise.com/</a>",1442789376

There are a bunch of things on screen and each is either clicked or not (okay, maybe hovered), at a fairly slow pace. The typical 87-key keyboard meanwhile gives you 87 on/offs right there and a good typist can be doing dozens of these per minute. Compare the speed with which a good vim user manipulates a document, with how you have to do it in Word.

My response concerns the &#x27;this is intended to be different&#x27; on the first slide, which grates because it&#x27;s a blanket statement. Had it added &#x27;different from a liberal arts education&#x27; or &#x27;different from what most think of college&#x27; then I would not react as strongly.<p>> 66% of high school graduates enroll in college within a year<p>Not all of those enter a liberal arts school. That 66% is those &#x27;who enroll in 2- or 4-year colleges in the fall immediately after completing high school&#x27;. 23.8% are in 2-year colleges and 42.1 are in 4-year colleges. (See <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_302.10.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_302.10.as...</a> ). Concerning the 2-year colleges, and quoting from <a href=""http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2014-03-10/features/os-florida-associate-science-degree-20140310_1_bachelor-degrees-valencia-college-science-degree"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2014-03-10/features/os-f...</a> .<p>> A.S. programs are different in that they require students to immediately specialize in a limited number of high-demand fields. They train in areas such as nursing, law-enforcement administration, media design and fire-science technology.<p>Certainly some of them are using a 2 year program as a stepping stone for a 4 year program. But college also includes religious colleges, culinary college, .. and looking around, it also includes the Aerosim Flight Academy in Florida. Which is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges, which is for schools that are &#x27;predominantly organized to educate students for occupational, trade and technical careers, and institutions that offer programs via distance education&#x27;. That is, it&#x27;s definitely not a liberal arts college.<p>So while 66% is correct, my question for you is 1) how many of those are going to something other than a &#x27;traditional&#x27; liberal arts college, and 2) why focus on the differences to a liberal arts college, which is the most dissimilar to your proposal, instead of the more similar technical and vocational colleges?<p>Regarding &#x27;standardized tests&#x27;, that definition you linked to goes on to say &#x27;the term is primarily associated with large-scale tests administered to sizeable populations of students, such as a multiple-choice test given to all the eighth-grade public-school students in a particular state, for example&#x27;. Your interpretation seems to be that just about any test is a standardized test, so long as there is a consistent grading scheme and more than one person being tested. Why not just call that a &#x27;test&#x27;, and leave &#x27;standardized test&#x27; for its primary association?<p>On the other hand, if you call teacher developed one-off tests for a given classroom a &#x27;standardized test&#x27; then I see no inherent problem with that. Just bear in mind that you want to replace standardized tests with standardized external advisers. Unless the external people are free to do whatever they want, they are being held to some standard, yes? Which is why they will get some (standardized) training in how to mentor students, yes?<p>Why do you think a standardized external adviser is more cost effective at providing the education that the student desires than standardized custom tests developed by the teachers for each course?<p>> &quot;Tenure is not the issue&quot;<p>You raised the issue, so I don&#x27;t think you should so easily dismiss it. Yes, I agree that your proposal is different than a liberal arts college. But why does that matter? A lot of other school are also different than a liberal arts school. Why should your proposal stand out among the crowd?<p>It&#x27;s like saying that your new two wheeled human powered vehicle is different than a car, when most people want to know how it&#x27;s different than a bicycle.<p>> &quot;I mean that there will be no classes, no semester, no academic year, no common schedule of any kind.&quot;<p>That is unusual for college. (Though standard for most of graduate school.) Researching now, that is called &#x27;competency-based education&#x27;.

When you say &quot;We won&#x27;t even be able to treat our independent contractors anywhere near as bad&quot;, you assume a system where your scheme is in place, and required. But why will schools switch to what appears to be a significantly more expensive system? How do you reassure people that the extra cost is worthwhile? If the colleges treat the external advisers like crap, and so get few advisers, except the incompetent and those who feel they can make a &#x27;social impact and [give] back to the community&#x27; despite getting low-balled - then what&#x27;s the downside?<p>You say the benefit of having no standards is that the half-trained 20 year old student can figure out what suits them best, rather than a fully trained 40 year old with years of teaching and industry experience. Yet what little I&#x27;ve seen on the topic suggests that students are usually a worse judge of their needs. For example, and quoting from <a href=""http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2013/10/21/what-exactly-do-student-evaluations-measure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2013/10/21/what-exactly-do-student...</a> :<p>> These studies confirm the common belief that good teachers can get bad evaluations: Teaching effectiveness, as measured by subsequent performance and career success, is negatively associated with student teaching evaluations. ..<p>> Students are arguably in the best position to judge certain aspects of teaching that contribute to effectiveness, such as clarity, pace, legibility, audibility.  We can use surveys to get a picture of these things; of course, the statistical issues raised in part I of this blog still matter (esp. response rates, inappropriate use of averages, false numerical precision, and scatter).<p>> Trouble ensues when we ask students to rate teaching effectiveness per se.<p>If students already do a poor job in estimating teacher effectiveness (based on subsequent performance and career success), then why should we believe they do any better at judging curriculum details? Quoting again from that link:<p>> Worthington (2002, p.13) also makes the troubling claim, “the questions in student evaluations of teaching concerning curriculum design, subject aims and objectives, and overall teaching performance appear most influenced by variables that are unrelated to effective teaching.<p>Of course there will be exceptions, both in terms of specific people and certain colleges. New College of Florida is one where more of these decisions are placed in the hands of the students, but it is not completely hands-off.<p>As for &quot;I suspect that most of the industry experts won&#x27;t be freelancers, but rather will be employed by one of the corporations with which we have a strategic partnership&quot;; do note that you have changed your position. You previously &#x27;the current model is that industry experts would be treated as independent contractors.&#x27; These are not really compatible. If they are employees of a company, will the goal of the industry expert be to provide a student the best education for the student, or the best education for the corporation?<p>When there is a conflict between the two goals, how often might the industry expert suffer negative employment consequences for supporting the student instead of the expert&#x27;s employer? In the current system, the teacher&#x27;s goals are much more aligned to the students goals, so this is less of an issue.<p>Regarding &quot;Here are some links where you can find information on industry best practices&quot; - that&#x27;s certainly not &quot;deep personalization&quot;, which is what you lead with. Nor are your examples more than what a teacher or undergraduate adviser can already do.<p>&quot;taking attendance&quot;<p>Many if not most college courses don&#x27;t take attendance except for those where class participation is important.  For example, I skipped out on a lot of my intro. physics courses. The homework was due at the end of class. We would skip class and work on the homework in the hallway outside.<p>There are of course classes where attendance is important eg, discussion-oriented classes, lab classes, and music ensemble classes; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to require a nursing student be present on the day the class practices drawing blood.<p>These sorts of classes, which you&#x27;ll note includes career oriented classes like nursing, cannot easily be handled by your proposed system.",1442788993

My uncle used to work as an engineer on an oil rig in the Gulf, and he had some fun stories about his experiences writing remote-control software for underwater ROVs.<p>Due to the intricate nature of the work the ROVs sometimes did, and the limited size of the onboard battery, the software had to be incredibly efficient. For instance, it had to take into account the variances in water temperature at various depths, since signals travel at ever-so-slightly different speeds depending on temperature. So the pillars carrying the rigs had temperature sensors every X feet that reported the water temperature in real-time, and the software took that into account to minimize latency and increase responsiveness for the pilot.<p>This one time, a ship was transporting a $500,000 computer onto the rig, and the crane snapped, sending the computer into the ocean. They were going to give up on it, but my uncle pulled an all-nighter and wrote a piece of software that calculated the possible locations the package could travel to given currents at various depths, and the next morning they sent ROVs to scan the ocean floor at those locations and were able to find the computer and carry it back tot the surface.

In some rankings, Gurgaon is the best city in India in which to live and work (Behl 2009). Gurgaon, however, lacks important infrastructure, especially in areas such as sewage and electricity where the optimal scale exceeds that of most builders. Thus, for large-scale infrastructure, important externalities are not internalized. We examine where Gurgaon has succeeded, where it has failed, and how people are adapting to both the successes and the failures. We compare Gurgaon with other private cities built on a different model, including Jamshedpur in India and Walt Disney World in the United States. The developing world, including India, is urbanizing rapidly. We draw lessons from Gurgaon to suggest how new private cities could be built on an even-greater scale, thus internalizing externalities while still keeping the advantages of private provision.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/TabarrokPublishedPapers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/TabarrokPublishedPapers.html</a>",1442788632

I, as an American, have heard it forever.  If it&#x27;s true, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true just because of the degree.<p>While I get clobbered for this next statement, I&#x27;m tired of dancing around it.  A lot of college graduates come from rich families.  I have yet to find one rich family who didn&#x27;t help out their kids in one way, or another.  Some pay for Everything.  Some, especially, the father,  knows first hand just how difficult it is to make real money in America. They  help out their kids get through expensive graduate programs,  finance that business, co-sign for that first house, the perks can be tiny, like access to the family lawyer--who actually gives honest advice,  etc.<p>The poor and middle class kids usually have caring parents, but no one is helping them out.  There&#x27;s not much guidance growing up--not because the parents don&#x27;t care; they just don&#x27;t know.  And as to money, most just can&#x27;t help out.<p>In my high school, the kids who &quot;made it&quot; had rich parents.  Even the ones who went to UC Santa Cruz, and came home with different brains, are doing well right now.  I know so many average, below average rich kids, who with family money, just seem to do well.  Most don&#x27;t talk about it, because it&#x27;s embarrassing, but I&#x27;ve just seen too often to be anything other than external factors(money), and the right guidance.<p>A perfect example is our California  Luitentant governor.  He was a few years ahead of me in high school.  I watched his family help him out everytime he failed, and he failed a lot.\nWhether it was his learning disorder, his no direction college/baseball? career, his failed bars, his failed businesses, his legal problems, etc.; his family always helped him out.  This dude would have been homeless if not for that powerful family.  It&#x27;s more common than people think.  Yes, I used an extreme example because I just watched this guy on some tech channel abusing all the tech lingo, and he&#x27;s fresh on my mind.<p>I know HN doesn&#x27;t like it when we talk about family privilege; why?  (Yes--I know their are rich kids who get no help, and made it by way of Horatio Alger&#x27;s path.  You&#x27;re the exception though.<p>That&#x27;s why I have always been for helping out the poor and middle class kids.  The help is not enough, but take advantage of what&#x27;s  available.  And I know--it&#x27;s not fair that you have to finance that business through the credit card mafia.   Yes, you will watch some of your friends get these cushy positions in life.  Don&#x27;t beat yourself up over it--you probally didn&#x27;t have much/any help?<p>If you do make it, try to help the ones who really didn&#x27;t have the support.  No, they won&#x27;t ask out of , but just give them a shot?  They are grateful?  If anything don&#x27;t take advantage of them?  I&#x27;m not sure some colleges/businesses/professionals don&#x27;t take advantage of them?  Remember--rich kids don&#x27;t go to schools that advertise?<p>(Went to rant pretty quick.  Sorry--It just seems like we get this college debate too often.  If I was to do it over again; Yes, I would go to college.  I had a great time, on so many levels.  I just might, with these tuition levels, after graduation, build up my credit.  I might then start to pay off student loans with cc debt.  I would then file chapter 7, and start fresh.  It&#x27;s a glitch that&#x27;s there, but is hard to pull off.  These cc companies still redline, so your access to cash, will vary by county.  And there&#x27;s the morality clause the poor, and middle class are spoon feed--which will prevent this tactic from becomming popular?  Think of it as a strategic bankruptcy?  Yea, that one the rich do all the time?  Do it my the book--don&#x27;t do anything illegial.)",1442788237

How many billionaire lawyers and doctors are there? How many businesspeople, financiers, lawyers, or doctors make six figures at 22 years old?<p>I agree on the first part.  If you are optimizing for cash at 22, you are best off as a programmer.<p>However, by the time you are 30?   your doctor and lawyer friends are making 3x what you are.<p>As for your ceiling argument, you are simply wrong.   There are some programmers who made the jump to business person who have done very well but those people made their billions doing business, not programming.<p>You can make a strong argument that if you want to be a business person today, you should first get training as an Engineer;  many of the most ambitious MBAs I have met had an Engineering undergrad.   That&#x27;s valid, but they are still business people more than programmers.<p>If you actually just want to be a programmer, you have to be world-class to make a quarter-million a year.  I mean, I know some guys who do it... but they are absolutely incredible in ways that most of us simply couldn&#x27;t be.   For the rest of us, &quot;six figures&quot;  means &quot;we&#x27;re going to peak around $150K/yr&quot;   -  and that&#x27;s only if we live in a place with incredibly high rent.<p>Realistically, Doctors and Lawyers cap out much higher than Programmers.<p>>Not only that, it&#x27;s also less risky! How many programmers are $250k in debt at 25 years old without having worked a day in their lives in their chosen professions? How many doctors? How many lawyers?<p>Eh, there are plenty of people who wash out of computer science programs.   That&#x27;s true of both doctors and lawyers;  you do have a point that because doctor and lawyer training takes longer, you have the risk that if you wash out later in the process, you will have wasted a lot more money.",1442788167

I just have to call your comment complete bullshit.<p>I ignore the first two paragraphs which are devoid of content, but try to set you up as reasonable person.<p>Then you bring up parenthood. And boy, you messed that up. I don&#x27;t think you can fail any further. Not only are you trying to set up (your own!) rules to even _have_ a child, you are then ending in a - as far as I can read this comment - condescending &#x27;be better than your parents were&#x27; pat-on-the-back comment.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: You cannot make sure that you can take care of a child&#x27;s needs. You might be prepared to support a kid and looking forward to a family of three. Then you get twins or more. Or your kid has health problems (let&#x27;s take a really common but overused example: Trisomy 21). The former just means that your calculation was off by one or more and you basically pay twice+ of what you planned for - and arguably have more than twice the amount of stress.<p>The latter is something that influences the rest of your life. You probably _planned_ to pay for college, but now you pay for a lot more and basically will have a child that will need support in one way or another.<p>You claimed that the GP shouldn&#x27;t have kids if they couldn&#x27;t afford to take care of them. I say that you don&#x27;t even _know_ what kids need before you get them. Yes, if you live under a bridge you might not be in the best position to have a child. No, &quot;I might need help&quot; isn&#x27;t a reason to have no child though.<p>And frankly, I&#x27;m so sad that you really think that way. In my world, society is meant to support people in need. If I lose my job tomorrow, I&#x27;m glad to know that the people around me will support me - through taxes - until I get a new job. If I have a kid that needs help I&#x27;m glad to know that the people around me will contribute to make its life bearable/comfortable/as good as possible.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s the only thing a state is good for. If it cannot provide that, why would you associate yourself with it in the first place?

I&#x27;ve wasted too many weeks of my life hacking around bugs that antivirus programs introduced into my customers&#x27; systems.<p>A couple I&#x27;ve dealt with in the last six months:<p>McAfee Antivirus causes applications built with Unity 4 to fail when they call WWW.LoadFromCacheOrDownload() on a large asset bundle. This API call downloads a temp file and then renames the file to move it into the cache. But McAfee also opens the file for a virus scan. For a large file, the virus scan may not complete before Unity tries to rename the file, so the rename fails and you never get the asset bundle.<p>For one client I fixed this by patching Unity&#x27;s .exe file to add a retry loop on the rename call. Unity 5 also works around this issue with the same retry loop.<p>AVG Antivirus causes updates to fail for applications that use wyUpdate. wyUpdate calls the CreateMutex() function in the Windows API to make sure another updater instance isn&#x27;t already running. Bizarrely, when AVG is installed, CreateMutex() returns the wrong value, so wyUpdate thinks another instance is running and bails out. No updates for you!<p>Going back a few years, I tried NOD32 after some friends recommended it. It seemed fine, except the Alt+Tab key no longer worked. It was a known bug, unfixed for some time.<p>About 5-6 years ago, McAfee had a known bug - unfixed for nearly a year - than under some circumstances it would erase the entire hard drive.

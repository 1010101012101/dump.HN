4184302,comment,4183987,4184203,34,0,jclulow,,,"I think suggesting that nobody is hurt by ridiculous injunctions like this is a bit disingenuous.  Firstly, consumers are denied the chance to purchase a product that exists; it's been made!  It's ready to ship!  Sure, you might not want one, but it's certainly possible that other people do.<p>Something else an injuction does is robs a manufacturer of any time-to-market advantage that they may have had releasing the product when they were actually trying to do so.  Holding sales back by even a month can mean the missing of critical retail periods throughout the year.  I'm not even arguing either way about the validity of the claims <i>behind</i> the injunction here -- if it turns out they are in the wrong, then they should certainly pay damages to Apple based on how much damage that they caused by doing the wrong thing (i.e. profits from sales).<p>How much the target of an injunction benefits from being allowed to sell their product is concrete and measurable.  How much Apple benefit by preventing a competitor from placing a product on the market is, in stark contrast, essentially unknowable and thus difficult to compensate for if Apple turn out to be wrong.",1341135040

Even if Google produces prior art, and I wouldn't be surprised if they did (although I haven't actually looked at the patents so I can't be 100% certain), the injunction would still exist.<p>So yes, there is a well understood process for invalidating patents. And that is, no doubt, going to play a major role in the case. But all that comes <i>after</i> the problem itself--the injunction lasts <i>while</i> people are showing prior art and forwarding any other arguments they have.<p>So my complete understanding is as follows: the fundamental problem here is the patent system. The issue is that Apple was able to get weak patents and then is able to use those patents to get an injunction on a product <i>before</i> the patents can get tested in court. This lets them leverage a weak hand and ~$100m to weaken their competition, regardless of the patents' actual validity. This, combined with a bunch of other problems with the patent system (oh, let's patent math as long as it's run on some computer!) is why there is a call for patent reform. The reason people are annoyed with Apple is that, instead of being nice, they're abusing a broken system to damage their competition.<p>Of course, I'm certainly no lawyer and have been following this case only superficially.

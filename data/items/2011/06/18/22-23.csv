When something doesn't work while browsing, it hurts the user.  Why do you think they put so much effort on combating Flash? Why push HTML5? They couldn't drop Flash and not support a replacement. They had to make that push, and it worked well for them.<p>I'd love the option to expose my iPad Safari as a normal desktop safari.  Many sites don't give me the option of going to a non-mobile version, and it sucks.  It breaks being able to browse on my iPad.<p>How could they do that smoothly in an Apple like way? I don't know.

If they expect to need more urban housing and infrastructure in the future and also expect the price of commodities (and also labor for construction, perhaps) to increase significantly, it makes sense to build them now. Since China already keeps a lot of capital in the form of US treasuries, it makes sense that they would want to diversify their investments by also building up a surplus of physical capital such as housing and other infrastructure.",1308436676

Obviously the same argument can be taken to apply to TV, movies etc and IIRC is more or less implied by the US constitution (it says that a system of limited rights may be permitted for the progress of the creative arts, or something like that).<p>I guess the same thing is taken to apply to innovation as well, that Apple is encouraged to invent a cool new operating system for their mobile phone because they control it exclusively once they've done that. The argument would run that if anyone could then just copy it, Apple wouldn't gain relative to their competitors by creating it so wouldn't have spent the money in the first place, and hence less innovation.<p>I'm not necessarily arguing for this point of view - goodness knows I think that it's too far-reaching and over-enforced at the moment.

Since every second internet user makes Google money, making the web a great place for both consumers (speed, security) and developers (standards, up-to-date browsers) is very much in Google's interest.\n2) It makes Google the default search engine. Instead of being at the mercy of browser developers and having to pay them huge sums of money, they can directly make lots of people use their search engine (and look at their ads).<p>I personally believe the second point is what actually finances the Chrome team. Like android, Chrome is but ""moat"" for Google, protecting their main source of revenue: Search. Shaking up the industry for the better is just a nice side effect.",1308435408

What I mean is that any ORM, even a theoretically perfect one, requires that you write an entire datamodel in your application that manages to remain consistent under modifications.<p>What a chore !<p>Then you get to write a battery of tests (and I mean a battery, dear God, this is many tests)<p>What a chore !<p>And I don't mean this in the sense that I want to get out from under it, but you have to admit, making a datamodel remain consistent in-memory ... it's not hard ... it's not challenging ... but it's very hard to get that last bug out of it, and SQL ... well they've done this for you.<p>So why would you bother doing this ? And before you say it, as anyone who wrote a few webapps knows : you DON'T need a datamodel in your application to create very complex webapps. In fact one of the big reasons for the (unfortunate) popularity of PHP is that you don't.<p>None of the ORM frameworks solves the data consistency problem half as elegant as SQL does. So why bother ? There's one good answer to that question : because it doesn't scale (although 99% of sql does scale, just large reporting queries don't. Of course, these don't scale no matter what system you use, it's just that sql makes it very easy to build this).<p>Also : take a look at how SAP products work. They solve the problem of big reporting queries by having massive amounts of triggers generate the reports for them. This scales, is easily distributed, and it's amazing what it can do. Of course, what it can't do efficiently is give you new reports based on old data.",1308435379

What I'm not so sure of is if they were planning on <i>keeping</i> the other ""likes"". I sure hope not.<p>They also need to figure out more ways in which a +1 can be useful to the user. It just makes their search a bit better? I don't think that's enough.<p>EDIT: The reason I'm saying that is because, I don't think ""making search better"" should be the main ""feature"" of +1. Think of it this way. Say I were a regular user of Bing. And last I heard they are using Facebook likes to improve the search results, make them more social and so on.<p>Now the question is - would I start liking stuff just because I want my search results to be improved or because I want my friends to see what web pages I like <i>on Bing</i>? Probably not.<p>If anything I'll like a page because:<p>1) I want to let the publisher know that I like the article/page<p>2) I want my friends on Facebook to see I liked it<p>I think people are using +1 now just for the first reason, and it doesn't seem that compelling to me. Pressing the +1 button feels like you're upvoting a comment on Engadget, and  it probably mostly gets impulse clicks. But if this is all it does, then I doubt the +1 button will be more used than a Retweet or Like.<p>Also, I'm not sure what Google's grand social strategy is, but there seems to be one strong correlation between successful social networks (Twitter, Facebook) and revolutions. So Google would need to ask themselves: Can +1/our social strategy be used in a country that wants to do a revolution, and help them achieve that revolution with its help?<p>Maybe if they integrate it in Youtube, and 10,000 Iranian people +1 one video on it, it would appear at the top of many Iran related Google searches? That might work. Either way, I feel that passing this revolution test will be the difference between a successful social strategy and a bad one, because I think that if a social network can pass this test, it also means it can be useful for a lot of other social things, too.<p>I also hope they're going to redesign the Profiles page if that's where they intend to let you see all the +1's, and that they streamline the Profiles URL.",1308434957

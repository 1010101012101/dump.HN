The following was probably written down by someone else a long time ago, but I don't know by who or when.<p>When you entangle two systems, they have to actually be in the same place/with slower-than-light communication distance. Thus, they each store ""secret"" information in some <i>deterministic</i> way which is impossible to measure directly, and which we can probe only using repeated experiments and probability distributions. The idea is that while quantum systems are deterministic just like mechanical ones, they hide their determinism in black boxes whose mechanisms it is impossible to discover. The ""uncollapsed waveform"" has in fact been collapsed ahead of time, you just don't know what the answer is until you measure.<p>Back to our entangled particles, when you separate them the determined decision they made when they were together is revealed. They do not need to communicate, as they already have their story straight.<p>It seems this entire area of research is a misnomer - if you let the prisoners talk to each other just after arrest, of course their stories will be complimentary later, even if one is in Alcatraz and the other in Siberia. You just have to assume that <i>particles so small we can only ""see"" them in the way they interact with other particles have some internal structure/state that we also can't see,</i> and thus like the prisoners, can remember the story.<p>(of course, declaring an entire area of research irrelevant is usually a sign that I've missed the point wildly - if anyone would like to correct my mistake I'd be interested to hear!)",1351677217

It does things mostly the 'right' way in my opinion.  However, while I like it, it's not ""mine"" in the way Tcl was, and I stepped back and started looking at everything in a more critical, but also more open way and have been a lot more inclined to call a spade a spade, even with the languages I like:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4716838"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4716838</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4716890"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4716890</a><p>But coming back to it, that attitude of ""if Tcl doesn't do that, it doesn't really matter, and maybe not doing that is a good thing anyway"" is prevalent in language flame warriors of all stripes, and, in my opinion is something to be avoided: if you can't look at yourself honestly, you won't improve.",1351676550

So, while a you can take an ultra thin laptop w/ SSD add 2 lb's of battery's and be good to go it's now just a normal laptop with poor specs and a long battery life that few people actually care about when they can just plug in or use an external battery.<p>iPad's on the other hand are highly dependent on battery life.

I have written a dozen of (embedded) domain specific languages to support rapid development. This is quite easy in haskell. Parsec helps with writing parsers for your DSL.<p>What I saw, was that the amount of tests could be reduced, when using haskell. The type of testing is also somewhat different. You don't have to test for type errors. QuickCheck let you test mathematical properties (in an empiric way).<p>The FFI compensates for the missing libraries, but is a bit difficult to use.<p>But the biggest reason of using haskell for me, was the way it handles concurrency and the high abstraction level. This enables you to write distributed applications in a more convenient way than usual.

Still, I want to reply to your comment, even if my reply is bit harsh, but Haskell always makes me a bit bitter:<p>First of all, I played with some web frameworks in Haskell and didn't like them at all: the yesod community had a very dismissive tone towards people that didn't want to use what they perceived as ""standard"" and Snap is well organized, but sometimes weirdly implemented around the corners (WAT? The templating library also serves static files?). I would love to use any of them, but they are still not fit to build ecosystems like Django, Rails or Spring.<p>Its nice that you picked the JSON library (by Brian?) as an example for a lib that can be written in ""a few day"". `aeson` is a great library. Its just not something that someone without detailed Haskell knowledge can write in a few days. It requires good knowledge of Haskell, especially things like the GHC.Generics library and Template Haskell (Hint: GHC.Generics is not very well documented for practical uses as well, the documentation spares you of the hard cases).<p>I found that if you go away from those 'core' libraries, quality drops sharply. Giving just one example may be unfair, but I do it anyways: the readline bindings (haskeline) didn't build on OS X for 2 major releases straight.
Also 0.1 and 0.2 seem to be very common version numbers on hackage and most documentation boils down to type descriptions. For loves sake, I couldn't find a good and proper tutorial working with bidirectional streams (think websockets) and asking a GHC committer ended in ""well, we're still not sure what the best abstraction for this is, theres multiple competing"" and someone on the Haskell User Group Berlin said ""well, its not such an easy problem, but it will be solved in a year or so"". In Ruby, thats implemented in an hour (safe and sound using libraries, with proper abstractions), today.
Yes, I honestly think that the library situation is bad - its not the lack of libraries, its the number of half-hearted libraries vs. the real good ones.<p>Also: Pro-active teaching, like producing screencasts and tutorials is sadly not very common in the Haskell community as well (weirdly, this is spotty: haskell-cafe, Real World Haskell and Learn you a Haskell are shining examples of how things should be, also in other communities).<p>I am surprised by how much the Haskell community always says ""type system"" first, but seems to put all other practical considerations on the backseat. Also, it is common to just dismiss concerns without addressing them.<p>That said, I still love Haskell and enjoy developing in it when things are working smoothly, I just wished that the community were more receptive and less dismissive to actual problems of people that are not as deep inside the language as people spending every evening on it.",1351674682

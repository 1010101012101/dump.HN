If person B repairs his widget, he now has a widget worth $10 plus the $8 cash he saved - his balance sheet shows $18 of assets. Thus, person A destroyed $8 of assets by behaving irrationally/inefficiently.<p>One may say person A's frenzied purchasing of widgets drives R&D dollars into the development of better widgets. A good counter-argument is that it was more important to develop things other than widgets and that by focusing so much on accelerating widget development scenario A forsook technological progress in more productive areas.<p>We saw this happen with the construction industry across the developed world siphoning dollars and talent away from other areas that would have produced more long-term benefit.",1336557490
3947810,comment,3946997,3947574,3,0,tikhonj,,,"I don't know, there are some other pretty compelling examples out there already.<p>The application I like most is programming languages--not just compilers and interpreters but also various tools and analysis. I think quite a lot of software related to languages gets written in functional languages, and in my experience Haskell is much better for that sort of thing than Python or JavaScript. I've actually written <i>very</i> similar interpreters in all three languages so I think I have a particularly useful perspective here.<p>Another field is web development. There was an article recently about Yesod's being as productive as Rails; I think a functional language would be a safe choice for your next web app.<p>I think there has even been some 3D modelling software written in a functional language--Wings3D is written in Erlang unless I'm much mistaken.<p>I haven't really been paying much attention to other fields--all my time recently has been spent almost equally between language stuff and web stuff--but I think there are other cases where functional programming is a fairly safe choice that are not just calculations.<p>Coincidentally, I doubt that we will see Photoshop or a word processor in a functional language any time soon. Not because functional languages are particularly unsuitable but because word and image processing software is rather big, boring and requires a lot of specialized knowledge; I imagine the intersection between ""functional programming enthusiasts"" and ""word processor enthusiasts"" is not very big. In fact, most of the people I know who like functional programming use something like LaTeX rather than a word processor and don't do much image manipulation either.",1336557461

3947807,comment,3944294,3944294,2,0,xkcdfanboy,,,"Call it what you want but the web is a way better development environment for UIs than anything else. If the device isn't mobile, speed isn't an issue. The only reason web apps are lackluster now is for speed reasons. I have developed my companies app in HTML5 for the iPad using Phonegap. Speed is good on the iPad 3 but alpha layers had to be turned off because the blending put too much strain on the processor/gfx card. Also transitions are a bit iffy, glitchy, and not as fast as I hoped they could be. However, when I run my app straight from Safari or Chrome on my Macbook, super fast, almost insane speed, and the webkit transitions look damn nice, on par with most things I've seen from Cocoa and Windows UI Animation toolkits. The reason why HTML apps are so slow is because these engines were built originally for static pages, the codebases can't instantly be transformed to be super optimized for dynamic, animating, heavily sized, heavily routined(setTimeout) content but they have been releasing a lot of performance updates so things look optimistic for HTML apps.",1336557315

Say branch A adds a call to foo(), and branch B swaps out foo() for foo_nolock(). You can tell from the round trip on branch A that there was a new reference to foo(). Then in branch B you can tell that the implementation of foo() has changed.<p>I'm not sure how you would represent such a conflict. A valid way to resolve it would be to tell the DVCS, ""You dummy, this isn't a conflict, the author of branch B obviously wanted to change foo() for every call-site, even those he didn't know about.""

There's just a million of them, and the only ones that get picked up by the mainstream are probably ones with lots of novelty value.<p>I could add a couple more puzzles in an update, but in terms of reach, I can't monetize people who have already purchased an unlock, and if they haven't already purchased the app, they probably won't despite the update (just a guess). I might get some sort of app ranking boost from the people that update, so I suppose that might be worth it.<p>In the case of building flash / web assets, I'd have to go out and build those and then promote them as well. An incredible amount of work where my goal was just trying to drive app downloads + unlock upgrades. I don't think such an indirect path is feasible when I make only $1.99 on a purchase.

Questions like ""was this book copied unfairly?"" are totally within bounds because everyone is familiar with the objects and context in play. But I think it's a stretch to expect any twelve people pulled off the street to be able to comprehend the concept of ""an API"" and the other technical things swirling around this case. Maybe this jury was pretty smart, but I know no matter how many times this concept is explained to my grandma, for example, she will not really understand what you were talking about.<p>I think the fact that you have two opposing teams of ""experts"" makes it even more difficult for the jury; Oracle surely brings people in that talk about APIs in more concrete terms so that they can strengthen their copyright claim, and Google surely brings in people that say, ""No, an API is just a set of concepts that trigger magic in some other code"", and I think that normal people would just be more confused after hearing this.<p>Wouldn't it be better to simply recognize this is a case that requires deep technical knowledge, find software people who do not have a bias one way or the other toward Google/Oracle, and put them on the jury, where they will understand the extreme consequences of ruling that APIs represent copyright infringement, instead of just sitting twelve random people in front of two or three short videos and expecting them to grasp that the outcome of the case here will effect and set precedent as to whether clean-room implementations anywhere are legitimate, and what that means? If this precedent was set way back when it may even have been construed to apply to implementations of protocols like HTTP; imagine the consequences if some early player like Urbana-Champaign was given the copyright to the ""HTTP API"" and no one except them was allowed to write a browser that used HTTP (without licensure).

I'd estimate that even a minimal toolkit would be on par with the time invested into GHC itself, and to seriously compete, tack a couple of orders of magnitude on there.<p>In a world where everybody implements MVC web framework in their favorite language, reimplements window managers in their favorite language, and reimplements all manner of other software simply because it wasn't in their favorite language... there's a reason all the communities just bind to GTK, QT, and wxWidgets and don't reimplement widget frameworks from scratch in their favorite language, even for languages much better funded and bigger than all the functional programming communities put together.

3947740,comment,3947103,3947397,10,0,__david__,,,"> You can imagine that I write a new filesystem for Linux, but I wait two years and the FS interface has changed drastically, the old patch is meaningless.<p>Perhaps, but the same could be said for git: the original <i>commit</i> is also meaningless because so much has changed since. I don't see that as a compelling argument.<p>Also, darcs lets you explicitly set dependencies on patches for the cases when it can't automatically detect them. The key philosophical difference is that darcs doesn't use time as an implicit dependency.<p>We use darcs on greenfelt.net. We push patches to our development repo which is where the other developers pull from. When we are happy with the state of the feature we push the patches (manually, usually from 2 to 10 patches) to our test site for a quick sanity check and then push that live.<p>In practice this means that we have half finished features/ideas on our development repo that never get pushed (the oldest patch is from 2009 and is still perfectly relevant, I might add). It also means that bug fixes can be fast-tracked through (directly from development repo to the production server), when appropriate. This is all handled by darcs in a <i>very</i> straightforward manner (of all the DVCSes I've used, darcs has the absolute simplest/best UI--git has been copying it a lot lately, see ""git add -p"").<p>The other thing that I found that we do <i>constantly</i> with darcs that isn't really doable in git is ""darcs unpull"". If someone pushes a patch to the development repo that is flawed you can just unpull it and tell them to go fix it. We use darcs-notify so that the team is emailed when someone unpulls a patch from the main repo because it requires everyone on the team to unpull the patch. Of course, most of the time a patch gets unpulled it happens before anyone else has pulled it. We've done this even on fast-moving projects and it's less scary than it sounds, and allows you to keep the coding standards high.<p>Along those lines, I've noticed that the darcs push and pull UI encourages code review by asking you explicitly which patches you want to push/pull. At the prompt you press 'v' and it prints the patch up so you can see what it actually does. It's a seemingly small thing but I've watched other developers change their coding/patch styles dramatically after using darcs and watching the patches go by. I tend to use ""darcs push"" as a last minute quick code review to make sure there's nothing overtly stupid in my patched. I can't tell you the number of times I've control-C-ed a darcs push and amended to make the patches correct.<p>One thing I've noticed in using both darcs and git extensively is that once you've really embraced each one they encourage different kinds of commits. Darcs really likes light, independent patches (since conflicts are not darcs's strong suit) and git likes more atomic feature patches (since a commit that touches 15 files doesn't have any drawbacks).",1336555963

A conflict is considered resolved if these operations are commutative, that is, the order of commits doesn't affect the result. Manual intervention is required when this fails to be true.

Even on a superficial level, Git is enormously lacking in this aspect. More fundamentally, the way moving changes around between branches works in Darcs is significantly simpler and ""hey, it read my mind!"" than in Git, where you need to understand the underlying object model and the tools very well to do this well. Sure, many other things are a disaster in Darcs, but I'm not saying Darcs will replace Git. I'm saying something inspired by it well.",1336554406

I think on of the rule of thumb, when creating a webservice with credentials, is to store the password in the way in the database, that it cannot be retrieved. I mean, you usually obfuscate it with some salt and then hash it afterwards.<p>Assuming Twitter does this kind of obfuscation, then all the password couldn't be retrieved from Twitter directly and hence no blaim on Twitter side.<p>Assuming Twitter does not obfuscate the password, why then nobody mentioning this? In such a case Twitter made a beginner failure and this should be somehow pointed out, I think.

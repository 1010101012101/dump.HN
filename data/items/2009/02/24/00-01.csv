You could have built the web and everything you needed and then written your app :)<p>""Development is faster"" presumably means ""relative to what people are trying to do"". That's the sense in which the OP uses it, because he's talking about development going faster per project.

492479,comment,491923,492095,0,0,jerf,,,"""I don't mean this personally, but I'm getting a bit tired of git users pointing to the reflog as protection against data loss.... By default, this expiration time is two weeks.""<p>So, set it to ten years, and lose nothing of interest. (It's not a Y2K-like problem because the value of a commit decays over time. Nobody will need to go back in time ten years to recover a commit that wasn't in the main line, because nobody will even know enough to ask a question that could be an answer to.) Does that answer your objection?<p>""This übercommit may still be sliced and diced back down to the buggy micro-commits that detail its dirty development, but, by default, will be presented as a single monolithic changeset to the user. No history is lost, and none is rewritten; you're simply altering its presentation.""<p>You could do that with git now. Branch for every commit, and squash it back down onto the main branch. Tag the final HEAD of the branch and include the tag in your squash commit record, and you can use it to recover all the component commits. If it bothers you that git still won't understand what that means, you're just a couple of shell scripts away from having the functionality fairly well supported.<p>(git, thanks to its heritage, shell scripts fairly well, and of course anything else that can do ""shell-script-like"" things (Python, perl, etc.) can handle it too. We have several simple scripts that sit on top of git and help us impose policy on our branch management. So, I'm not terribly sympathetic to criticisms of git that are one config change or a quick shell script away from being fixed. Although, probably not for the reason you think; it's not because I think those who don't customize their VCS is automatically a lazy developer, it's because everybody has their own unique needs.)",1235437105

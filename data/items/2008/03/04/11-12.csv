Plus you tend to be poor on welfare even in Germany. Why is it okay to have 11.7% of the population be impoverished and idle? While the UK, Australia and the US have 5% or less unemployment?",1204629518

Put in the blogs you read, how much you like them, and get some recommendations, both blogs and other people who have tastes similar to yours.<p>Indeed, Google Reader has a feature just like this...",1204628839

We see lots of blogs come up here over and over again.   What gems are there out there that we're missing?",1204628511

The way I see this, if we happen to have greater intelligences working for our common good, we would be able to solve any problem better than a human could - including a possible problem of feeling useless. <i>This</i> would be the best-case scenario, and IMHO it would be much better than the world we have today. Possible solutions to the problem, from my limited human brain, could be bringing the human brains up to the level of the greater intelligence and hence finding new problems to solve, altering human drives so it isn't a problem any longer, abolishing AGI entirely or partially, etc. Any problem could in such a best-case scenario be solved better and faster than humans could.<p>I agree with you on the worst or worse-case scenario point. There are huge ethical risks and implications in creating very powerful and capable machines. This means that we need to go into this situation with our eyes open, and make sure that we discuss ethics, transparency and consequences from day one.<p>Enslaving humanity is a basic human drive, and I like to believe that we can do better than that if we try hard. In a pure cost-benefit analysis, it is obvious that it would be best to use such technology to help out everyone.",1204628465

And suppose we were also do the same thing with the ink Marvel uses, and the staples Marvel uses.<p>Then we wait 40 or 50 years, and look back to identify the books that turned out to be very valuable in hind site, but did not appear so when they were new. For instance, books like Journey into Mystery #83. Journey into Mystery was an anthology series. It had started out, I believe, as horror, and slowly changed to science fiction. In #83, one of the stories was of a Norse god, Thor, in our world.<p>Nothing about that stood out to alert people that this was the start of something big, and so maybe they would want to buy extra copies to preserve. Just another new character in a book with new characters all th time. But this one WAS different...more Thor stories appeared, and he became a feature in every issue, and gradually they stopped having non-Thor stories and the book became The Mighty Thor.<p>Anyway, we look back and identify a book that we now see was another Journey into Mystery #83 (which, BTW, is worth something like $50k now). Then we reprint it, on our 50 year old paper, using our 50 year old ink, and stapled with our 50 year old staples. Then we age it for a few years (I&#x27;m guessing that ink diffuses some through the paper and so experts could easily tell if a page has been freshly printed).<p>Is this a viable evil plan?",1383332386

On top of, that numerous Apple devices have only had 2 years of software updates (e.g. iPod Touch 4th Gen) before being discontinued.<p>Furthermore Apple has settle numerous lawsuits and class action suits filed against it for failure to repair devices under warranty, claiming such bizarre things as being a smoker creates a hazardous operating environment in violation of the warranty.  They&#x27;ve had numerous lawsuits against them for manufacturing defects on devices that resulted in high numbers of failures outside of warranty periods (e.g. iBook power-on issue).<p>Microsoft ships a baseline package of drivers but it&#x27;s up to vendors and device manufacturers to maintain driver support for Microsoft&#x27;s Operating Systems so that&#x27;s not even a valid comparison.<p><i>That&#x27;s why you have a profit-margin after all</i><p>No, that&#x27;s not why you have profit-margins.

There&#x27;s not much substance in that article. It very briefly mentions the subsidized catastrophic insurance you mention, but it doesn&#x27;t go into much detail at all. Worse, it completely handwaves away the major problem with that model, namely, what happens to people with chronic conditions, by basically saying &quot;oh well, too bad, so sad.&quot;<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t see how that approach is ultimately very different. Sure, it means people cover a bit more stuff out of pocket, and places a higher burden on sick poor people, but overall it&#x27;s pretty much the same.<p>The ultimate question that has to be answered is this: do we, as a society, find it acceptable to allow people to die of treatable illnesses when they can&#x27;t afford to pay for the treatment? This question has been solidly answered as &quot;no&quot; in the US for some decades now, ever since hospitals were barred from turning away patients in the emergency room. The question now is simply <i>how</i> you accomplish it.<p>So, back to these subsidized catastrophic plans. You&#x27;ll have to have a mandate on them! Without a mandate, people who aren&#x27;t sick won&#x27;t buy them unless you hold some other threat over their head, such as denying them the ability to obtain insurance if they&#x27;re already sick.<p>Unless we&#x27;re going to let people die, the wealth transfer you describe has to happen in some way. Pre-Obamacare, it works using a de-facto hidden employment tax whereby better-off people pay, in a really convoluted fashion, for the unpaid bills of poor people. With Obamacare, it works by forcing people to get insurance even if they don&#x27;t want it. The Republican idea discussed in your link is some combination of the two, and exactly what the combination is depends on the exact details.<p>Obamacare is just about the most free-market solution for universal health coverage you can come up with. It&#x27;s more free-market than the pre-Obamacare regime, it was proposed by Republicans, and it was <i>passed</i> by Republicans in Massachusetts just a few years prior to becoming law at the national level. And lest we think that those Massachusetts Republicans were some fringe group, they nominated the governor for President!

6655417,comment,6654179,6654822,7,0,teddyh,,,"From <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/GNU-Manuals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/GNU-Manuals.htm...</a><p>The preferred document format for the GNU system is the Texinfo formatting language. Every GNU package should (ideally) have documentation in Texinfo both for reference and for learners. Texinfo makes it possible to produce a good quality formatted book, using TeX, and to generate an Info file. It is also possible to generate HTML output from Texinfo source.<p>[...]<p>Make sure your manual is clear to a reader who knows nothing about the topic and reads it straight through. This means covering basic topics at the beginning, and advanced topics only later. This also means defining every specialized term when it is first used.<p>Programmers tend to carry over the structure of the program as the structure for its documentation. But this structure is not necessarily good for explaining how to use the program; it may be irrelevant and confusing for a user.<p>Instead, the right way to structure documentation is according to the concepts and questions that a user will have in mind when reading it. This principle applies at every level, from the lowest (ordering sentences in a paragraph) to the highest (ordering of chapter topics within the manual). Sometimes this structure of ideas matches the structure of the implementation of the software being documentedbut often they are different. An important part of learning to write good documentation is to learn to notice when you have unthinkingly structured the documentation like the implementation, stop yourself, and look for better alternatives.<p>For example, each program in the GNU system probably ought to be documented in one manual; but this does not mean each program should have its own manual. That would be following the structure of the implementation, rather than the structure that helps the user understand.<p>Instead, each manual should cover a coherent <i>topic</i>. For example, instead of a manual for diff and a manual for diff3, we have one manual for comparison of files which covers both of those programs, as well as cmp. By documenting these programs together, we can make the whole subject clearer.<p>The manual which discusses a program should certainly document all of the programs command-line options and all of its commands. It should give examples of their use. But dont organize the manual as a list of features. Instead, organize it logically, by subtopics. Address the questions that a user will ask when thinking about the job that the program does. Dont just tell the reader what each feature can dosay what jobs it is good for, and show how to use it for those jobs. Explain what is recommended usage, and what kinds of usage users should avoid.<p>In general, a GNU manual should serve both as tutorial and reference. It should be set up for convenient access to each topic through Info, and for reading straight through (appendixes aside). A GNU manual should give a good introduction to a beginner reading through from the start, and should also provide all the details that hackers want. The Bison manual (<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Concepts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Concepts...</a>) is a good example of thisplease take a look at it to see what we mean.<p>That is not as hard as it first sounds. Arrange each chapter as a logical breakdown of its topic, but order the sections, and write their text, so that reading the chapter straight through makes sense. Do likewise when structuring the book into chapters, and when structuring a section into paragraphs. The watchword is, <i>at each point, address the most fundamental and important issue raised by the preceding text</i>.<p>If necessary, add extra chapters at the beginning of the manual which are purely tutorial and cover the basics of the subject. These provide the framework for a beginner to understand the rest of the manual. The Bison manual (<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Concepts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Concepts...</a>) provides a good example of how to do this.<p>To serve as a reference, a manual should have an Index that lists all the functions, variables, options, and important concepts that are part of the program. One combined Index should do for a short manual, but sometimes for a complex package it is better to use multiple indices. The Texinfo manual includes advice on preparing good index entries, see <i>Making Index Entries</i>(<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_node/Index-Entries.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_nod...</a>) in GNU Texinfo, and see <i>Defining the Entries of an Index</i>(<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_node/Indexing-Commands.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_nod...</a>) in GNU Texinfo.<p>Dont use Unix man pages as a model for how to write GNU documentation; most of them are terse, badly structured, and give inadequate explanation of the underlying concepts. (There are, of course, some exceptions.) Also, Unix man pages use a particular format which is different from what we use in GNU manuals.<p>[...]",1383331025

There goes every user who uses RSS, widgets, or the dozen visualizations from digg themselves - all of which link directly to the story article.<p>digg already throttles people's votes - in a nondirect way. Yes, your vote counts as much as mine, but if a group of users attempting to game the system are voting on that story - then that story requires more votes to get to the front of the page.<p>The throttling is implemented at the story level based on the users voting for that story and the pattern in which they are voting.",1178028425

Is your app really that complex where you require these services or are you planning ahead for scaling issues?<p>Personally, I go with Dreamhost. The price is right, their service is awesome, and customer support is willing to help you with whatever you need. If scaling becomes an issue - then go looking for a dedicated host.<p>For 90% of the startups that launch, scaling will never become an issue.",1178028234

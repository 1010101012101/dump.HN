2645221,comment,2644801,2644950,1,0,amac,,,"Good point about not switching. I'll go into more detail; I should have mentioned that I also act as a bridge between our IT dept and our admin, marketing, sales dept's. In an ideal world, I (and our employees/stakeholders I guess) see our CMS/scripting/webserver/stack etc as not being more important than what we market to our customers/potential customers. (At the moment, it is for sure)<p>With this in mind, there's probably two chief concerns; from a publishing perspective - content - and from a technical perspective, databases.<p>Ideally, I'd like a system where anyone in the company (any location or technically ability) can submit content for reviewing, approving and publishing via branch managers. All internal content right now is on sharepoint, so I guess a cms that can integrate with msft applications like sharepoint, outlook, word etc would perfect. (Umbraco possibly can do this I believe, it's not possible with Joomla - for me, it's not suitable for the average person)<p>Adding to this, if we could connect our sql erp and ecommerce databases and tie all this up in a database cluster e.g. a tightly integrated information website with ecommerce and customer accounts capabilities.<p>I understand this might not be possible with an open source cms and might require a tonne of custom development. Nevertheless, I'd be intrigued if anyone can share their previous experiences.",1307836775

2645219,comment,2644458,2645110,2,0,chipsy,,,"In a PEG you operate under the expectation that all rules will be tried exhaustively, so if one fails you just move on to the next, and if they all fail you drop back a level of recursion.<p>Thus you can have rules like:<p>""if <if-expr>"" where if-expr can contain ""<statements> else"" or ""<statements> if"" or ""then <statements>"", where statements is a set of predefined keywords, another set of PEG rules, or a regular expression matcher.<p>And then you can just expect that they'll all be tried at some point.<p>The main issue with this, of course, is the one you raised, with endings and creating rules for delimiting new blocks. Although it's possible to define a good set of rules, it's still hard to distinguish between a continuation of a statement and the start of a new one, and in most cases you won't get a useful syntax error message using a naive PEG system like the one in PEG.js, because it'll just drop all the way to the top level and then fail at the first character without telling you how far/deep it got before the syntax broke.<p>So in practice having end symbols is still useful to make the grammar operate sanely. PEG can also be used to execute a relatively flat pass that mostly produces tokens and simple expressions, while other methods are applied to the resulting tree to get the complete structure. This is an approach which I find a little less mind-bending than trying to cram everything into PEG rules, since you can use varying methods of parsing as the situation dictates.",1307836751

""Linux on the Desktop"" is dead in the water without a devoted hardware supplier that writes all drivers and sells computers running Linux. The kernel itself is perfectly modern but we just often don't have proper driver support.<p>- Some desktop subsystems still suck. Is Audio bulletproof yet? PulseAudio seems too complex, OSSv4 is out of kernel and is not suspend/hibernate aware, Alsa is outdated.<p>- Desktop software is terrible. No office suite that feels solid, apps written with a mismash of backends, languages, and toolkits, everything feels designed by committee. No stationary canonical APIs to build proprietary software on. No commercial software suites (CAD, Office, Adobe, Steam, etc) or free software equivalents.<p>- GTK and Qt do not cut it. They are not attractive, they are not modern, interface design doesn't appear to be a priority, most devs don't want to write desktop software in C or C++.<p>The only way for Linux on the desktop to thrive is under the power of a commercial hardware company that designs systems with Linux in mind, gets the support of commercial 3rd party software companies, and completely eschews Gnome and KDE. That is a massive amount of work/money so I don't expect it to ever happen.<p>I have used Linux on the desktop since 2002 (and will continue to use it) but I'm not delusional. Funnily enough, I've tried going back to Windows 7 (I am dual booting now) but I inexplicably have more driver problems on Win7 than I do on Linux (Thinkpad).<p>I'm not a typical computer user, though.

If you want to be an implementer, the big question is how do you implement the best damn software you can.  Sometimes the answer to that will be to go work for a big company with a large support system, and sometimes the answer will be to strike off on your own.  The best implementers I know have done both, and often have financial rewards from both phases of their lives.  There's no one unique answer that will apply to all points in your career; if you believe there is one, you're artificially limiting yourself.<p>Don't worry about what other people do or how they're rewarded for it.

The three popular ways out of this are:<p>1. To ignore it entirely, stating that we don't really care about the implications of quantum mechanics and are just happy that it's useful for calculating things. LA LA LA!<p>2. To declare that yes, well, maybe it sort-of does, but it doesn't matter because there's no <i>actual</i> information being transmitted. I can't use quantum entanglement to send a message to Alpha Centauri, since I have no control over the sequence of bits which get transmitted; the most I can do is ensure that both they and I wind up with the same string of completely random bits.<p>3.

  referred by Connecticut-based affiliates like you  even if

 and require the same operating system support as AVX. Generally, most of the
 promoted 256-bit vector integer instructions follow the 128-bit lane operation,
 similar to the promoted 256-bit floating-point SIMD instructions in AVX.
 Newer functionalities in AVX2 generally fall into the following categories:<p>    Fetching non-contiguous data elements from memory using vector-index
      memory addressing. These gather instructions introduce a new memory-addressing form, consisting of a base register and multiple indices specified by a
      vector register (either XMM or YMM). Data elements sizes of 32 and 64-bits are
      supported, and data types for floating-point and integer elements are also
      supported.<p>    Cross-lane functionalities are provided with several new instructions for
      broadcast and permute operations. Some of the 256-bit vector integer instruc-
      tions promoted from legacy SSE instruction sets also exhibit cross-lane behavior,
      e.g. VPMOVZ/VPMOVS family.<p>   AVX2 complements the AVX instructions that are typed for floating-point
    operation with a full compliment of equivalent set for operating with 32/64-bit
    integer data elements.<p>   Vector shift instructions with per-element shift count. Data elements sizes of 32

For some reason, the simple act of getting up out of a chair is a significant barrier for me, to the point that I'll be stuck in my chair all day, forsaking food, until I am forced by urinary needs.<p>But standing at my computer, my entire life exists on a single eye-level plain. The activation energy of rising from a chair is no longer a barrier. I step, pace, turn around. I walk out of my office every 15 - 30 minutes, usually just to look out a window and then promptly return. I talk to my colleagues more.

The first clinical symptom is pitting edema, and the severity shocked me when I first noticed it. Turns out, your legs depend on regular contractions by the big skeletal muscles to pump blood back up toward your heart. Your veins are equipped with check valves for this purpose. Standing still puts the worst possible stress on these veins, as it both maximizes hydrostatic pressure and robs them of the muscle-pumping. I don't know how to stop this other than to wear compression socks, which in turn requires me to always wear pants to appease my vanity.<p>The low-back pain I had from time to time previously is gone.

I do get minor pains in my feet and more significant pain along the medial aspect of my right knee, which I think is an old MCL injury that's being aggravated by my pronating foot.

There is almost always a terminal velocity. We can transmit waves via a fluid, and particles through it as well.<p>I would like to know what vacuum looks like at the Planck scale. Perhaps entropy increases slower or faster based on interactions at the smallest scale between light/matter and whatever space-time is. Movement through the medium at higher speeds decreases these interactions, maybe by skipping over them.

The dangling-else ambiguity in C (for example) is a real ambiguity that you have to tell your users about.  Prioritized choice hides ambiguities and gives you no hint when you develop your grammars where the ambiguities are.<p>* PEG-based parsers are less efficient than LL parsers.  LL parsers are O(n) in time and O(d) in space (where n is the length of the input and d is the depth of the nesting).  To parse a PEG in O(n) time the space complexity becomes O(n) (this is a packrat parser).  To parse with O(d) space, time complexity becomes O(n^d) (as with lpeg).  And the constant factor for LL parsing is much lower than with packrat parsing.<p>I think the future is LL.  When the tooling gets good enough with LL, I think that the primary motivation for PEGs (that they are easy to use) will evaporate.",1307833268

Also, the fact that the writer bought the phone in a store without trying it out first.<p>I lost my Nexus one recently* and when I got around to replacing it my wife also decided she wanted a smartphone instead of the Blackberry she had. So now  I had to look into family line sharing plans etc. and thought I'd better go to the T-Mobile store, and that I might as well scope out the newer phones while I was at it. So even though I'm tech savvy and know Android phones very well, I spent a good 45 minutes asking questions and playing with the store models. At the end of all that I decided to just get another Nexus One for myself and the same model for Mrs Browl; 4g wasn't so important to me because I don't watch videos or do big downloads on my phone, likewise I didn't need beefy CPU because I don't want to play 3d games on such a tiny screen, and I decided to stick with a naked Android phone because I didn't want all the vendor crud. Also, you can get a Nexus One new in the box for $250 now and avoid a service contract.<p>* Which is part of why I've been a bit unsocial of late IRL, btw - I owe lunch to a few people!<p>When I got the phones I upgraded both to the latest version of Android but otherwise left my wife's phone unconfigured, and gave her only minimal 'tech support' - I was curious to see how she'd choose to customize it, and also to get a more objective look at how she'd react to Android and the Google ecosystem (she didn't have a gmail account prior to this). While she had quite different tastes from me in terms of how she organizes it and what sort of apps she likes, she's been entirely comfortable with it.<p>Her main complaint is the rather mediocre selection of apps in the Android marketplace (she likes apps more than I do); mine is the glitchiness in the stock browser.

As the name ""Hacker News"" (or ""Startup News"") implies, the\ngoal is collecting ""news"" articles rather than ""classics"" or even\n""topics"" and of course, this design splits discussions amongst related\nsubmissions.<p>For the moment, let's just assume a ""merge"" feature exists. How would a\nmerged thread be handled for the sake of display? How would up-votes be\nhandled? How would flags be handled? --We've got a tough problems right\nthere, but we've skipped over the most blatant problems...<p>Who decides a merge?<p>Can merging be abused?<p>What granularity of merging is desired? (Do you want everything\nregarding recent problem of the AirBnB customer to be in a single\nsubmission, or do you want absolutely <i>everything</i> regarding AirBnB in\ntotal to be in a single submission?)<p>Who decides the granularity?<p>The existing duplicate checking is based entirely on the given URL of a\nsubmission, so it is easily abused, and knowingly flawed, but it's still\nfar better than nothing. Identifying duplicates, and more relevant to\nthis discussion, similarities, would require content analysis of the\nsubmitted URLs. It is feasible, but it is not easy. None the less, a\nsolid content analysis algorithm would take care of the ""who"" and\n""abuse"" problems, as well as allow some degree of configuration on the\ngranularity.<p>Using your example ( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2822080"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2822080</a> ):<p>Assuming the seven submissions of the  ""G-Man"" video are hosted at\ndifferent URLs (duplicate videos on youtube), <i>really</i> <i>serious</i> content\nanalysis would require downloading and analyzing all seven video files.\nOh wait, the asshats at google (and every other video site) refuse to\nsimply give you a link to the video file(s), so you have to do your own\nparsing, processing and often de-flash-ing of their pages to figure out\nthe file download URL. And as soon as you have it working, they will\nchange how they present video to break your code (see\n<a href=""http://savevideo.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://savevideo.me</a> and similar browser addons for reference).<p>The other problem with content analysis on HN is the server would melt\ninto a pile of slag. As HN exists, a single FreeBSD box (AFAIK), it\nwould never be able to handle the load of content analysis.<p>Colin, your manual cross referencing is helpful, and I do appreciate it,\nbut I believe it is a waste of your skill and time. Yes, I remember you\nhave some code to somewhat automate it, but the reaction from the last\ntime you ran it was not the most positive. We can't treat HN as our\nprivate play pen; for users it's a utility, but for PG/YC it is a way to\nsource hackers to fund and a way to promote news stories about YC funded\ncompanies. --I don't mean it in a bad way, instead, it's just the well\nknown facts/benefits about HN. HN serves different purposes for\ndifferent people. I've always admired how PG and RTM consistently try to\nsell shovels in a gold rush (viaweb, ...), and HN is simply their newest\ntype of shovel. ;)<p>Sadly, the phrase, ""All press is good press,"" should now come to mind.\nIn other words, consolidating submitted stories into merged submissions\nis actually disadvantageous to PG, YC, and the YC funded founders. You\nare asking them to get less valuable press. Everyone who understands how\nAirBnB works has been expecting a catastrophe like this to happen\neventually. BUT AirBnB making it onto the front page of the Financial\nTimes is extremely good for their business, even with ""bad"" press like\nthis.<p>Though many find ""endless repetition"" of similar submissions annoying,\nthe people in control of HN/YC and the founders of YC funded\ncompanies understand it is <i>VERY</i> advantageous for them. Given you are\nasking to ""harm"" the powers that be here on HN, you can be reasonably\nwell assured that we're stuck with endless repetition. This is most\nlikely the reason why you (currently) have 218 ""Do Nothing"" votes, and\nworse, 27 ""Go away.

The answer can be found, as many answers in life, in the tradeoffs.""<p>This seems to beat around the bush a lot so here's the problem as I see it:<p>When the code hits the browser, ClojureScript programs are not composed of Data Structures.<p>They are composed of Java script, which acts as an assembly code. In a normal lisp, you would have the compiler right along side the generated assembly, so there would be no big deal... you want to eval something, just compile it and link it in to the run-time.<p>In this case, the compiler is on the server, the code is in the browser... to provide an 'eval', you would have to send an RPC from the server to the browser...<p>It is disingenuous to say that you cannot support an optimizing compiler and maintain the presence of eval in the language. This is simply not true.<p>What you cannot do is:<p>1.) Separate the compiler from the runtime.<p>2.) Aggressively ELIMINATE code that is not being used.<p>""You cannot effectively leverage these libraries without an optimizing compiler utilizing dead-code elimination. You cannot have the optimizing compiler if you wish to support eval. Q.E.D.""<p>Note that it is 'the optimizing compiler' not 'an optimizing compiler'. It would be possible to have an optimizing compiler without dead code elimination, or even the same optimizing compiler with dead code elimination turned off (no idea of that is possible).<p>I think that claim number 1 is the questionable one. It seems like it would be relatively easy to decide the level of dead code elimination by indicating whether eval is available to the language. It may just mean you have to declare what functions/packages are to be made available to eval (which from a security standpoint makes a lot of sense; actually).<p>---\nThinking about it,\nA possible repl implementation would actually be fairly simple:<p>1.) Create a hashtable<p>2.) Fill hash-table with desirable functions to execute<p>3.) Write an interpreter that recursively applies the head symbol of a list to the tail of a list (by looking up the symbol in the hash table). (Edit: There may be another wrinkle, like looking up variable symbols).This is basically what eval does.<p>4.) Create a loop that parses a lisp list into a javascript list, and applies the interpreter.<p>The hole here is that there is no way to define 'new' functions. This may be possible by having a function returning a function which calls our interpreter (and adding that to the hash table as a new function). The question I have about this is being able to use arguments.. but even that may be possible.<p>In fact, the above seems to allow for dead code elimination, as you have declared exactly which functions you want accessible to the user.<p>edit: Sorry if I offended, but what is wrong with my post?",1311961522

But I am going to comment on this mainly because, having owned almost everything they released and because I have a lot of great memories from its games, I am really emotional about Nintendo.<p>They have been in the industry for almost 40 years: started distributing Magnavox in 1974, made huge success with Donkey Kong arcade in 1981 and released their first consoles in the beginning of the same decade (Game Watch and Famicom-NES).<p>No company has made it that far, no company has been so innovative and no company has had the lows of Ninty (Sony is probably having a bad era with PS3 but that's their first bad release -handhelds excluded- and Microsoft has been doing fantastic with all XBoxes). Furthermore, no company managed to even come close to Nintendo in the handhelds.<p>As much as I love Apple (and can even consider myself kind of a fanboy) I just can't stand it when they try to involve it everywhere and explain everything as a result of its success.<p>Nintendo is Nintendo's prey, they dug the hole that they fell into. The 3DS is not selling bad because people are buying Angry Birds instead of Super Mario. It's not selling well because, well, what is there to sell? It's unbelievable that Nintendo released a handheld with such a weak launch-titles line. Tell me one game that will make you want to buy 3DS. You don't buy a console and then wait for games to come out. You want the games there. Unless it's something really major, like the Wii, when you can see its potential and you can do with games like Wii Sports for a while.<p>But the 3DS is a handheld, I am not going to buy it just to spend 10 minutes on a Piccadilly line ride playing mini games and waiting for a few major games to come out, when they come, with the quality they come out, etc.. I can compare that to playing Doodle Jump and Doodle Jump wins easily. What I can't compare to Doodle Jump is a Zelda/Mario/AAA game on my 3DS.<p>It's not about Apple vs Nintendo, nobody will buy an iPhone to play video games. And it's not about whether Nintendo can do well as a iOS/Android/WebOS games developer. Of course they can and I hope they do if they get in such a bad position. What it really is about is whether Nintendo can help handheld gaming keep its value.<p>Also, it's not hard to see that they are going to fall into another hole if they don't do MAJOR things with the WiiU. So I am kind of glad that the 3DS release wasn't successful, I can hope they are getting a few messages..",1311959509

First, you're only looking at one side of the equation.  You're ignoring the cost and damage to the economy that government spending does.  I don't just mean by crowding out other, more efficient solutions, but the literal taxation and inflation that government uses to get the money in the first place inhibits economic growth.  Both actions reduce the ""bottom line"" for consumers and companies and thus reduce the funds they have available when deciding to make capital purchases- whether it is a house or a car or sending kids to college or building a plant to create more jobs.  All of the money government takes prevents those things from happening.<p>The second is that you're ignoring that much of that ""investment"" is actually spent on activities that are themselves net-harmful to the economy.  Such as the overzealous regulators that shut businesses down, the agencies that spend their time inhibiting efficient running of businesses, or even make it impossible to operate your plant safely because government regulations don't allow the use of the latest safety equipment (only what was on the market at the time the regulation was created) or FDA examiners that drive costs thru the roof, and prevent access to drugs for dying people because the drugs are ""experimental"" and might kill them in 20 years (though their disease will get them a lot sooner) etc.  Much of the money government spends is on programs that make people less safe and more on topic, undermine economic growth with no real benefit other than providing good political jobs to hand out.<p>""This is a lovely dream with little evidence to support it.""<p>The entire history of the USA supports it.<p>""The idea that rich people getting richer helps the economy is not founded on fact.""<p>The error you're making here is that you think that letting people keep their money only helps the rich.  IF you take all of the incomes of the bottom %50 of the populace and you compare it to the incomes of the tope %50 of the populace, there are a lot more people in the lower half and they make a lot more money.  Not squandering that money benefits them a whole lot more than it does the rich.<p>Frankly, the economics are not really up for debate. They don't support your side. The slogans about ""rich people getting rich"" are just rationalizations for theft.<p>That theft, actually, hurts poor people more than it does rich people. Rich people are insulated, the poor are not.<p>Bush's original Tax cut proposed reducing taxes for poor people by %50, IIRC, and the reduction for the richest was around %2.  After the democrats managed to ""compromise"" it, what got passed reduced taxes for the poorest by %20.  Why weren't the democrats in favor of the large tax cut for the poor?<p>And even still, even though every way you measure it-- dollar terms or percentage terms-- these tax cuts helped the poor more than the rich, ever since they've been passed, democrats have been calling them ""tax cuts for the rich"".<p>Frankly, from an economics perspective, lower regulation, lower taxes, lower inflation, no matter how unevenly applied, helps the poor.  It always does, it always will, and in fact it has to-- the primary way you get rich is by improving the lives of the poor.<p>I don't understand why democrats constantly support policies that hurt the poor, are constantly trying to raise their taxes (While always, of course, claiming to only want to tax the rich) but they do.<p>I'm not a republican, so, put down that assumption  I've just studied economics.

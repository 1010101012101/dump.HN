In all its brevity, it exhibits one of the absolute top fallacies of capitalist thinking when in &quot;have evolved anti-market biases&quot; you allude to markets being some kind of &#x27;natural&#x27; state of affairs. This falsity was neatly summed up by George Soros: <i>Classical economics is based on a false analogy with Newtonian physics</i>... by which he means, if you listen to or read any of his numerous interviews, that there is no &#x27;equilibrium&#x27; and self-regulating nature of the market is fundamentally more a well-spun, oft-repeated tale than a self-evident truth. Further smackdown can be applied through reading <i>Debt: The First 5000 Years</i> (which conventional capitalist economists positively hate).<p>Leaving that aside, you&#x27;ll note that I alluded to the ugly truth (the world is inherently limited; ie. there&#x27;s sure to be critical resource shortages given current trajectories). From my perspective, any so-called <i>anti-market bias</i> will evolve right about the time we see mass starvations due to stupid short-sighted environmental management, potable water shortages, etc. - ie. if you think we&#x27;ve got <i>anti-market bias</i> now ... my wager is that you&#x27;ll be shocked at how hollow the notion becomes in the relatively near future.<p>But the view does have some credence, ie. some forms of decision-making don&#x27;t scale. But the obvious answer to that, far from assuming a self-evident path of decoupling historically present social, environmental, cultural and other local factors from economic decision-making across an inherently globalized god-like market that will deliver us from all ills as you imply (clearly, it won&#x27;t), is perhaps to evolve newer and more subtle modes of collective decision-making that include market-like consideration of these factors and scale more effectively.

[...] I postulate that this common structure will be part of one possible deﬁnitive programming language&quot;.<p>Then we have four conclusions:<p>1. the notion of declarative programming is a the &#x27;core&#x27; of programming languages<p>2. it will also stay there<p>3. it is concluded that message passing &quot;<i>seems</i> to be the correct default for general purpose concurrent programming&quot; (my emphasis)<p>@1: what&#x27;s the &#x27;core&#x27;? Without any useful definition, this is a meaningless statement.<p>@2: aha! The core seems to change over time. OK, I rephrase my last question: what&#x27;s the &#x27;core&#x27; today?<p>@3: First, it&#x27;s a weak conclusion that something &#x27;seems&#x27; to be the case. But, ignoring the odd usage of the word &#x27;correct&#x27;, how does the author support this conclusion? It seems like the author thinks that presenting a couple examples <i>for</i> your proposed solution (message passing) allows to conclude that a competing solution (shared memory programming) is worse. I fail to see evidence for that. Yeah, programming with locks is harder than programming with actors. But it&#x27;s also more expressive, so the comparison is unfair. If you want to compare erlang to, say, java, you need to compare it to programming with higher level data structures (queues, actors, ...).<p>btw, this one&#x27;s a gem: &quot;Declarative concurrency is a deterministic form of concurrency that is much\nsimpler to program with than the shared-state concurrency used in mainstream\nlanguages such as Java [18]&quot; -- if you look at [18], it doesn&#x27;t support the simplicity claim; it&#x27;s a reference to Doug Lea&#x27;s &quot;Concurrent Programming in Java&quot;.

It took me a while to discover its importance. Most people like to believe something is or is not true. Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well. They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory. If you believe too much you&#x27;ll never notice the flaws; if you doubt too much you won&#x27;t get started. It requires a lovely balance. But most great scientists are well aware of why their theories are true and they are also well aware of some slight misfits which don&#x27;t quite fit and they don&#x27;t forget it. &quot;<p>---<p>2) By definition, what &quot;you&quot; are uniquely good at cannot be represented by logic, mathematics or reason.  Otherwise, &quot;you&quot; could be duplicated, cloned, automated.

A good starting point is understanding the history of the number zero.

There is no external necessity that forces us to answer such questions one way or another. We are free! The complement to necessity is not chance, it is choice! We can choose who we wish to become when we have decided on in principle undecidable questions.<p>This is the good news, American journalists would say. Now comes the bad news.<p>With this freedom of choice we are now responsible for whatever we choose! For some this freedom of choice is a gift from heaven.

I know it was engineered to have an I/O thread pool and scheduler specifically to handle those calls. So it seems that is not necessarily true (although it maybe true for Rust).<p>> Note that you not only have to worry about FFI bindings with this sort of architecture (as mentioned in the article)<p>Once you start writing C bindings and loading them into directly into the VM memory space you lose the isolation and many things that come with it. There are other ways to talk to C -- use a port (spawn as sub-process and use stdin/stdout + serialization, there is helper library to help with that code). Can also emulate whole Erlang node (VM) from C and talk to it using distributed Erlang protocol via a socket.<p>Other things that wreck your systems are running out of memory, out of disk space, filling your mailboxes or message queues due to large spike or consistent rate mismatches between senders and receivers. Also deadlocks.<p>The number #1 thing that wrecks systems is ... software bugs mixed with complexity. Throw concurrency, shared memory and pointers on top and it becomes a disaster. Small demos still look and work very very fast. Large concurrent systems become a mess. Yeah everyone can hold their hand up and swear to never create global structures or shared pointers and always talk via queues/mailboxes but then so did application when they ran in Windows 3.1 or DOS environment. It worked ok for that time. But eventually your word processor would crash because your game overwrote its memory and so on.<p>Running concurrent units of execution (threads), mixed with pointers and a shared memory is like going back and time and running Windows 3.1.<p>EDIT: Highly recommend reading  <a href=""http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-erlang-does-scheduling.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-erlang-does-...</a><p>It describes at an intermediate level what happens in Erlang scheduler.

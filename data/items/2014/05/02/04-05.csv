In this case, the word <i>unreasonable</i> is it for me. It is subjective. The court decided in this particular arrest/search that it was reasonable for the one resident to consent to the search while the other resident was not there. It is still unclear to me who actually has the right to consent. I would guess the person has to actually live there at least (and not just some party guest or something). It could go further and be limited to only those that are recognized residents (like only those on a lease/deed). I would assume that if my minor child was home alone, their consent would not be valid. I guess there is still plenty of wording to shave off in future cases.",1399006655

7684187,comment,7683024,7683917,1,0,nostrademons,,,"Not the OP (and also not taking sides in this), but I consider slavery to be a legal concept.  Wikipedia says slavery is &quot;treating people as property that can be bought and sold&quot; and property is itself a legal concept meaning that you have recourse to the state&#x27;s monopoly on physical force to enforce your right to use an object.  So I would consider slavery to be &quot;using the state&#x27;s monopoly on physical force to enforce dominion over another person&quot;.<p>There are certainly economic situations that I believe are abusive, like debt slavery, indentured servitude, or your McDonald&#x27;s example.  All systems eventually get gamed, and so even when the state says &quot;I&#x27;m going to stay out of this, you&#x27;re free to make contracts but I will not legitimize your power relationships against other people.&quot;  But there&#x27;s still a world of difference between &quot;You are property of this plantation owner, if you escape or disobey him you will be hunted down and returned in chains&quot; and &quot;You lack the economic means to support yourself, but you are free to never go to McDonald&#x27;s again and take your chances living on the street and scrounging up food from trash cans.&quot;  (I actually think laws that criminalize homelessness are much closer to slavery than minimum-wage jobs.)

7684182,comment,7676691,7683591,3,0,byuu,,,"That will definitely work, and be more portable to esoteric ABIs and calling conventions. But it was more than 3x as slow on the Pentium 4, Athlon 64 and Core 2 Duo E6600. I haven&#x27;t benchmarked since then. But you&#x27;re pushing and restoring a whole bunch of volatile registers in vain.<p>Another fun detail, I tried using xchg r32,m32 to swap the stack pointer out in one instruction. Turns out that on the Pentium 4 (and probably others), the instruction is implemented in microcode now. Plus it&#x27;s a guaranteed atomic operation. The benchmark I wrote ran at least 30x slower than with two mov instructions. I was absolutely blown away by that. People used that all the time in the 8086/80286 days to save a bit on code size (a much bigger deal back then.) Yet that same code, run today, can end up being substantially slower. Not knowing what opcodes will become slower in the future becomes a fairly compelling argument against writing inline assembly for speed.<p>ARM has nice register lists that you can use to mask out the volatile regs. So an optimal implementation is something like:<p><pre><code>    push {r4-r11}\n    stmia r1, {sp,lr}\n    ldmia r0, {sp,lr}\n    pop {r4-r11}\n    bx lr\n</code></pre>\nMoving on to amd64 ... Microsoft ignored the SystemV ABI (rbp,rbx,r12-r15 are non-volatile) and instead made xmm6-xmm15 non-volatile as well. This makes it more than twice as slow to perform a safe thread switch there. Even their own fibers implementation ignores xmm6-xmm15, unless a special flag is used.<p>Probably the strangest was the SPARC CPU. It has register windows for fast register saves/restores on leaf functions. Pretend your 16 regs were a block of memory. It gave you 16 blocks of that memory, and you could change one value to move to a new block of memory. When attempting threading, you couldn&#x27;t know if you would recurse enough to exhaust this window. So you had no choice but to save and restore every single register window. Context switching became <i>immensely</i> demanding. So much so that GCC offered a compilation flag to not use register windows in binaries it produced.<p>The choice of volatile vs non-volatile is really fascinating. The less non-volatile you have, the faster both cooperative and preemptive task switching is. But it also means you have less registers that remain safe to use after function calls.<p>There&#x27;s also caller vs callee non-volatility: either the caller has to back up the regs it thinks the callee will trample (or all of them); or the callee has to back up the regs it knows it will trample (but may end up backing up regs the caller doesn&#x27;t actually care about.)",1399006170

7684130,comment,7683024,7683603,3,0,nostrademons,,,"To make the &quot;freedom of contract&quot; argument more concrete - I am shortly leaving my job.  One major reason - though not the only one - is that I want to be free to work on projects of my choosing and not have them owned by my employer.  The reason I can do this is because I have enough money saved up from several years of service with them to live unemployed for a while.  I would not have this money had I not agreed to forfeit my right to own my side-projects for the duration of my employment, because the company would not have found it profitable to employ me if I was just going to burn all my mental energy on my own pet projects.<p>So giving up the right to own my own work, temporarily, has given the me the economic freedom to concentrate on my own work in the future.<p>This I think is what the poster meant by &quot;lacking perspective&quot;.  When you want to change a policy or law, you have to consider <i>all</i> effects of the change, including its effects on other peoples&#x27; behavior.  And you don&#x27;t get to reach into somebody else&#x27;s mind and tell them how they&#x27;re supposed to act without their consent - <i>that</i> is slavery.<p>So you have to consider the employer&#x27;s perspective as well, which is that if you&#x27;re just going to be working on your own thing, why should we pay you?<p>What&#x27;s the alternative that you propose?  Do you want the ability to own the stuff you produce on your free time?  You already <i>have</i> that ability - you can work as a contractor and set clear limits on the company&#x27;s ownership of your work-product.  I&#x27;ve heard of contractors even maintaining ownership of any frameworks or reusable libraries they build in the course of the job, they just need to negotiate this into the contract.  And in order to do that, you need to provide enough value to your client that they don&#x27;t mind you keeping that ownership, but that&#x27;s how things work: you don&#x27;t get things unless you give them.",1399004709

In a purely bitcoin to bitcoin world, this sort of transaction would not be an issue and you wouldn&#x27;t have a risk of an account being closed. But you&#x27;re not trying to do a purely bitcoin transaction here - you are trying to <i>exchange</i> bitcoin into your local currency and put the funds in your bank account (this is what we offer with our merchant tools).<p>To offer this service, we (Coinbase) work with those bank rules and that is why you are seeing our service act much like the traditional financial world. You might not like this, but we didn&#x27;t make those rules, and it is the only way I know of that works if you want to exchange bitcoin in the traditional financial world. (John&#x27;s answer from the support thread you linked also explains this).<p>Accepting purely bitcoin-to-bitcoin payments would be one solution that might work for this if that is what you want (there are plenty of other solutions other than Coinbase for this). I should mention that we are probably at fault for marketing it more as a bitcoin wallet vs an exchange which has different implications to people (I think this is part of the reason for the confusion).<p>Finally, I believe you may be mistaken that you can&#x27;t access the $5k in funds.

Areas that were setup as encomiendas ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encomienda"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encomienda</a> ) right from the period of Pizzaro and Cortez have retained that exact flavour. Individual strong men rule because that&#x27;s exactly what was setup. Any &quot;citizen&quot; (ie: indigenous person, slave, or otherwise disenfranchised individual) who tried to go against this system or even escape its clutches was punished severely. It is extremely hard to break that structure. If you wonder why that did not happen in North America, it was because the North was much more sparsely populated and so the colonizers had to setup systems that gave rights to everyone (except of course the sparse indigenous population that needed to be exterminated since it could not be &quot;encomienda&quot;-ed), just so that the companies that sponsored the colonization in North America (like the Virginia company) could turn a profit. It is noteworthy that the Virginia company for example, did actually plan to use the same encomienda approach but was startled to find that there weren&#x27;t enough compliant indigenous people to enslave. They then switched to trying to strongarm the colonialist/settlers but this had disastrous results. It was only thereafter they gave rights, and privileges to &quot;citizens&quot;. This all happened when they became desperate to get a return on their investment.<p>So yes, your statement is absolutely true. Long tradition indeed. Since 1492 in fact.",1448266218

Because that taxi market was all just &quot;rent-seeking oligopoly&quot; is bullshit. Sure, there were a lot of entrenched interests, but there were also a lot of others, some with very similar model to Uber, app included.

10613369,comment,10610478,10613309,0,0,zackchase,,,"Hi larsga. Thanks for your interest. To begin, yes the concatenated input RNN is much better. A Markov chain could not do this feat (or make comprehensible text at the character level generally). Occasionally the reviews contradict themselves, but they&#x27;re actually remarkably consistent regarding the conditioned upon attributes. I&#x27;d suggest you pay attention to the &quot;temperature&quot;. This is a parameter that determines how stochastic the generation is. With low temperatures the reviews are less varied but &quot;make more sense&quot;. With higher temperature they are more entropic.<p>When you tell it to make an IPA review it stays on topic and talks about hoppy flavor. About stouts is consistently calls them black, with hints of chocolate (not to mention using the word &quot;stout&quot;).<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a review I just generated for &quot;Fruit/Vegetable beer&quot;:<p>&quot;This brew pours a very clear golden color. The finger head is pretty small and fizzy and has a slightly pink color. The smell is really nice. The taste is fruity and sweet, but not overwhelming. The flavor is a little weak and is a bit sweeter than most beers but still very nice. I could drink this all day, but I would probably prefer the fruit beer to be a bit more pronounced. This beer is actually quite smooth and inviting. It has a strong taste of raspberries but is complimented by a nice tartness that comes through as well. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a dry finish. This is a very drinkable beer and I could see myself enjoying to try this one again.&quot;<p>Clearly the RNN learns to form words like &quot;fruity&quot; and &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;raspberries&quot; to describe a fruit beer. It also says the flavor is a little &quot;weak&quot; and in the next sentence says it would prefer for the taste to be &quot;more pronounced&quot;. Keep in mind, this neural network was given no a priori notion of words. A Markov chain cannot produce even remotely similar conditional text at the character level.<p>For proof that it learns to differentiate the different types of beer, we demonstrate in the paper that the model can be run as a classifier and classify the type of beer form the review with 90% accuracy (on previously unseen test data). This is almost comparable to state of the art logistic regression tf-idf ngram model, despite the fact that we haven&#x27;t even tuned the model especially carefully to be a classifier (with regularization or hyper-parameter search , for instance.<p>Here&#x27;s another example (for an IPA):<p>&quot;This is a fine IPA for sure, but not a beer I would love to drink a lot of. This is one of the better IPA&#x27;s I have ever had. I can see why the beer is unlike any IPA should be and the best beer I&#x27;ve ever had. I could drink this all night, but it is very drinkable. I could easily drink a few of these without a problem. I don&#x27;t know what the malt base but it is so faint and it is pretty tasty. I can see why the beer is a great hop bomb and the flavors are both subtle and superb. It&#x27;s a great balance and can be a good supply of the style. I like it, but the hops are a bit off the more I drink them, but the hops are very pronounced. The finish is a little bitter, and the hop flavors are great.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure what else to say, if you don&#x27;t believe that the net has learned to distinguish an IPA. Of course, it does contradict itself on sentiment. But with lower temperatures even this is not so common. It can also be addressed by setting extreme star ratings. (we can actually put in a 0 star rating, or as high as a 10 star rating to induce a review of more extreme sentiment).<p>A comedic point that must be made here is that the source material (the reviews from BeerAdvocate) are themselves absurd, and occasionally contradictory. They English they contain is ungrammatical, ridiculous, and frequently misspelled. Nevertheless it&#x27;s a fascinating dataset on account of how well-annotated and dense it is (the 190-core has over 250k reviews).",1448265750

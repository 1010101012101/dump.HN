Learning about recursion is better in a language suited for it.<p>My CS education was founded around Scheme in part because it was a good language for showing how things worked.  I thought the school went a little too far in that direction because outside of SQL, I had to teach myself every language I worked with thereafter.  But...

8261672,comment,8260694,8261504,7,0,arnsholt,,,"Another problem with teaching introductory programming in a Real Language, I think, is the temptation to also teach more software engineering-like things as well.<p>When you start measuring your experience with programming in decades rather than years, it&#x27;s hard to remember learning how to program is actually kinda hard. Thus, adding things like version control and IDEs to the mix gives you less time on teaching what should be the core of an introductory programming class: how to solve problems in code. Anything else is fluff that can be ignored until the foundations have been laid.<p>An additional reason I think using something &quot;weird&quot; like Haskell or Scheme is that it&#x27;s a very good equalizer (Haskell in particular). IME, this kind of class will have two kinds of student: those who already know how to program, and those who&#x27;ve never programmed. Those who already know how to program are mostly going to ignore the class, simply because it&#x27;s known to them already; and this is a problem because the interactions between strong students and weaker ones is massively helpful, to both parties. Teaching things is, somewhat ironically, perhaps the very best way of focussing your knowledge of it. When you&#x27;re explaining stuff to yourself (as it were), you can fudge the details you&#x27;re a bit vague on (which is generally thue tricky bits), but if you&#x27;re explaining it any vagueness is painfully obvious (I suspect this is also the reason simply explaining a problem to someone can be so helpful).",1409723295

8261639,comment,8260733,8260733,7,0,zanny,,,"Aw man, I guess I have to be the sweaty neckbeard...<p>The right notebook for Linux is a Linux notebook. Vendors of such machines are still boutique, but unlike in the past they actually exist. Just a few are Zareason, Thinkpenguin, and System76. I personally have an off brand Clevo 740 SU (same model as the System76 Galago) because I had confidence in the notebooks ability and got it OSless since I&#x27;d have to install Arch anyway.<p>But recommending all these Samsung and Llenovo <i>Windows</i> machines is a disservice to everyone. It is a disservice to the Linux ecosystem because you cannot guarantee hardware support and using a non-Windows OS will void your warranty most of the time (at least if they catch you with it). It means that you get a bad impression of the experience due to any bugs or glitches you encounter, and rather than acknowledge you crossed into the land of dragons and took the risk many end up blaming the ecosystem that cannot provide hardware support realistically for any parts the vendors do not support in kernel themselves - especially those that are actively hostile to attempts to implement hardware support (video drivers - Android ones are really bad right now, but Nouveau had to wage a tangible uphill battle to get where it is today, but a lot of wifi cards, pci cards, etc can have no vendor support).<p>It also means you are paying your MS tax, and getting a Windows license you intend not to use. I&#x27;m not even going to argue the price aspect, because we know it really does not matter - if Linux were ever a threat (and really, it already is with Windows talking about version 9 possibly being free or ultra low cost with the looming threat of Android) they would just give away licenses, and that combined with bloatware contracts would provide the vendors more revene than just shipping Ubuntu (or whatever distro).<p>What I care about is the message. Every Linux Thinkpad fanboy is one bullet point in the Llenovo board meeting affirming the need not to ever ship a non-Windows notebook (except in countries like Germany that actually force them to). It sends the message &quot;go ahead, bill me for a Windows license I&#x27;ll never use, and make me fight the hardware to make it work, but I will <i>still buy your stuff</i> because having a pleasant straightforward and painless Linux experience is not one of my priorities.<p>It also obscures how large the market segment is, because to these vendors every machine sold is a mark that Windows is still king. If they do not see retailors selling real Linux machines (including the Dell one) they have absoutely no reason to ever fathom selling Linux native machines themselves.<p>And that hurts <i>you</i>, because that means there is less adoption, fewer options, and less pressure towards more widespread use of the platform. And for whatever your reason, you want to use Linux right now, and buying these Windows machines denies others from having the chance to even know it exists, and supports the continued monopoly Microsoft has on the personal computing industry (and Apple is not even on that radar).<p>So please, when you are looking for a new notebook with the intent to run a Linux distro on it, give some consideration to the vendors actually selling Linux machines, with support, as first class citizens. If you cannot find one that meets you needs so be it, but don&#x27;t go out of your way to buy a Windows notebook and <i>hope</i> it can run a Linux distro flawlessly.",1409722301

For it is the customer, and he alone, who through being willing to pay for a good or for a service, converts economic resources into wealth, things into goods. What the business thinks it produces is not of first importance—especially not to the future of the business and to its success. What the customer thinks he is buying, what he considers “value,” is decisive—it determines what a business is, what it produces and whether it will prosper.<p>The customer is the foundation of a business and keeps it in existence. He alone gives employment. And it is to supply the consumer that society entrusts wealth-producing resources to the business enterprise.<p>Because it is its purpose to create a customer, any business enterprise has two—and only these two—basic functions: marketing and innovation.

I suppose you&#x27;re prepared for downvotes? ;-)<p>>Somehow Europe, Canada, Japan, etc, all make health care work but we can&#x27;t.<p>The thing is, that&#x27;s mostly accurate. Those places all have governments that still <i>occasionally</i> get out of bed in the morning and serve the interests of their citizens. America does not. Now, the <i>reason</i> it doesn&#x27;t in the first place, is mostly due to the actions of the same sort of assholes who would oppose universal healthcare on ideological grounds. So it&#x27;s rather chicken/egg to be sure, but the fact remains. As P.J. O&#x27;Rourke wrote in one of his more self-aware moments (when he was younger, basically), &quot;Republicans insist that government doesn&#x27;t work, and then they get elected and prove it&quot;.<p>So on the one hand, universal health care is a good thing and Americans should have it. On the other hand, the US government is, at best, <i>barely</i> capable of pulling it off. You praise the ACA, but surely you realize what a piece of shit program it implements? Compared to, as above, Europe, Canada, Japan, et al? It&#x27;s better than the regime that came before it, probably, but only just barely.

The problem with this is the nonlinearities cause the gradients to explode or vanish after a few layers. So the amount of computing power required to train them is huge.<p>Recurrent NNs had the same problem since they are equivalent to a very deep feed forward network; where every layer is a time step and the weights between every layer are the same.<p>But the invention of Long Short Term Memory has made training RNNs practical.

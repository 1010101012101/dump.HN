I'm asking not how you get over being solo and construct a bigger company, or how you maintain motivation, etc. I'm asking: if there is any of you that is a solopreneur or almost solopreneur by choice (ie, because they are more interested in building than in managing or selling), what can you tell about your specific case? How is your business, how do you avoid business growth separating you from the building process itself?",1212809836

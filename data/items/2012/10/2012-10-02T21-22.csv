4604594,comment,4603611,4603611,1,0,mekoka,,,"As people from various backgrounds get the opportunity to mingle, some obviously have a hard time with how to handle these encounters. They harbour an uneasiness when faced with the differences based on some false assumptions that they've made, maybe due to misinformation or (often inaccurate) cultural stereotypes. e.g. <i>when a black person meets a white person, that black person is particularly concerned if the white person is racist</i>. So they decide to bring forth what they perceive to be the elephant in the room, by preemptively expressing that they themselves are very open to cultural differences. Now, the way this is done takes some interesting forms, from the more subtle:<p><i>I have a friend from [insert some exotic country here].</i>
<i>I love [insert some singer from some minority group here]</i><p>To the more awkward:<p><i>What's up bro!</i>
<i>[insert awkward racial remark of your liking here]</i><p>It comes to no surprise that some would even choose to compensate by exhibiting a bold racist behaviour that, they think, should be received with some reverse psychology acrobatics: <i>I'm preemptively making racist jokes, because I want to show you that I'm not actually racist and rather open. (I'm also kinda covering my ass now, in case I do happen to trip over my tongue later and say something really out of place)</i>.<p>Sadly, an increasing amount of people who behave like this also think that it's ok and that racism is now in the eye of the beholder. So they will tell their jokes to Kevin, who they've just barely met and if Kevin takes offence, then it's Kevin who's too sensitive about that kind of humour. So they will apologize by saying something like <i>relax bro, I didn't mean it in a racist way. I have many black friends. Racism doesn't exist anymore. Chill, have a sense of humour.</i> They never stop to wonder, did Kevin, who is from Ghana, connect with their African American stereotyped jokes? Do his black friends actually even call him ""bro""? Does he or the people he associates with actually use the n word?<p>Do they actually acknowledge that this behaviour isn't acceptable? The way they reason is, <i>I'm not racist, so I can just keep calling my black friends n</i><i></i><i>, as long as I don't mean it in a negative way.</i> So it's not surprising that later they'll try the exact same jokes on Robert, thinking he might be of the ""more open minded inclination"".<p>My tip when it comes to befriend minorities (this is going to be a let down): They're just people, get to know them like you would anybody else. Don't attempt any ""hacks"", don't play games, don't test them thinking that the outcome should be different from any other human being. Take the time to know the person, don't assume that you've figured them out based on their gender, orientation or physical appearance.",1349214992

4604592,comment,4604579,4604579,1,0,fintler,,,"Full announcement email:<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is pleased to announce the selection of Keccak as the winner of the SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition and the new SHA-3 hash algorithm.  Keccak was designed by a team of cryptographers from Belgium and Italy, they are:<p>* Guido Bertoni (Italy) of STMicroelectronics,<p>* Joan Daemen (Belgium) of STMicroelectronics,<p>* Michal Peeters (Belgium) of NXP Semiconductors, and<p>* Gilles Van Assche (Belgium) of STMicroelectronics.<p>NIST formally announced the SHA-3 competition in 2007 with an open call for the submission of candidate hash algorithms, and received 64 submissions from cryptographers around the world.  In an ongoing review process, including two open conferences, the cryptographic community provided an enormous amount of expert feedback, andNIST winnowed the original 64 candidates down to the five finalist candidates  BLAKE, Grstl, JH, Keccak and Skein. These finalists were further reviewed in a third public conference in March 2012.<p>NIST chose Keccak over the four other excellent finalists for its elegant design, large security margin, good general performance, excellent efficiency in hardware implementations, and for its flexibility.  Keccak uses a new sponge construction chaining mode, based on a fixed permutation, that can readily be adjusted to trade generic security strength for throughput, and can generate larger or smaller hash outputs as required.  The Keccak designers have also defined a modified chaining mode for Keccak that provides authenticated encryption.
Additionally, Keccak complements the existing SHA-2 family of hash algorithms well. NIST remains confident in the security of SHA-2 which is now widely implemented, and the SHA-2 hash algorithms will continue to be used for the foreseeable future, as indicated in the NIST hash policy statement. One benefit that Keccak offers as the SHA-3 winner is its difference in design and implementation properties from that of SHA-2.  It seems very unlikely that a single new cryptanalytic attack or approach could threaten both algorithms.  Similarly, the very different implementation properties of the two algorithms will allow future application and protocol designers greater flexibility infinding one of the two hash algorithms that fits well with their requirements.
NIST thanks the many people in companies, universities, laboratories and organizations around the world that participated in and contributed to the SHA-3 competition, especially the submitters of all the candidate algorithms, and the many others who contributed expert cryptanalysis, and performance studies.  NIST could not have done the competition without them.<p>A detailed report of the final round of the competition will be published in the near future. Information about the SHA-3 competition is available at: <a href=""http://www.nist.gov/hash-competition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nist.gov/hash-competition</a>",1349214980

I happen to fall into the last unprotected class on the planet (old fat white guys :-) but having worked with and at times managed a very diverse set of folks my entire life it became clear there are people who are racists by 'choice' and people who are reflexively racist.<p>Lets postulate for the sake of example that racism had a measurable quantity, from 1.0 which is some sort of 'my race is the only one worth anything' to the 0.0 which is complete blindness to race in thought, speech, or action.<p>The perception of racism or sexism for people whom have discussed the experience with me was that one person could exhibit say 0.5 units of bias, and they they fall into a thought process that everyone is 0.5 racist. It very much shares a sort of 'herd immunity' reflex. If 90% percent of the folks in the group are blind to race issues then the 10% who aren't will stick out. What percentage of people have to be tolerably racist before its toxic? Does it matter? Why would anyone tolerate any sort racism in the work place?<p>So if person A is racist by choice, which is to say they have done some sort of evaluation and decided that race has an effect which transcends environment or skills, their actions and comments will create in people of that 'other' race a reflexive alter-racism (and always people are not perfect reflectors, for some it bounces off, for others it gets amplified). Now you get something like racism amplification by stimulated emission of insults [1} or something. That sort of situation is, painful, toxic to morale, and legally actionable.<p>The critical point though is we have to see this sort of missive not as 'professional victims' (although there are such people, painting any individual into that group without first hand knowledge is probably wrong) but as a signal that you have a problem. And getting everyone to buy into the notion that we're all individuals and not everyone finds ethnic jokes or sex jokes funny, is one of the more important jobs for management. As an individual you're best off trying not to be part of the problem.<p>[1] RASEI? The effect is remarkably similar",1349213683

4604396,comment,4604188,4604188,42,0,tptacek,,,"Keccak's (pronounced: ketchup) team includes Joan Daemen, who was also on the Rijndael team, giving him a hand in both AES and SHA-3.<p>Keccak's structure is simple and markedly different from that of MD4, MD5, SHA1, and the SHA-2 family, all of which share a common design pattern called Merkle-Damgard (MD). MD-style hashes chunk their inputs into blocks and tag the last block with a length; they then run in a manner similar to a block cipher, where each block is combined with the previous block after the hash function core is applied. The resulting output of these MD-style hashes is literally the internal state of the hash at the last block; you can take most SHA-2 hashes, for instance, and ""feed them back"" to the SHA function with more data to generate a continued hash. This gives rise to a common crypto protocol flaw called a ""length extension attack"".<p>Unlike MD, Keccak uses a design called a ""sponge function"". It's called a ""Sponge"" because it splits hash into two distinct stages: one in which the hash function ""absorbs"" data, applying the hash core function to permute an internal state, and another in which the hash is ""squeezed"" to produce output (which further permutes the state). Somewhat like a cryptographic PRNG, the security of the hash function is delegated to the confidentiality of the internal state, which isn't disclosed by producing the hash.<p>Furthermore, Keccak's Sponge design derives security by only allowing inputs to directly influence a subset of the internal state bits. Like MD hashes, the inputs are chunked into blocks and fed to the hash algorithm. But each block fed to the hash affects only that block's worth of internal state bits; the remainder of the hash's state (called the ""capacity bits"") are mixed in with the ""outer"" bits during the application of the hash core. Here's a picture that may tell the story better:<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/cryptosponge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/cryptosponge</a><p>Notice how the ""M"" bits of the input hit only the ""r"" bits of ""outer"" state in the hash, while the ""c"" bits of ""capacity"" are used only during the ""f"" function.",1349212849

The victim- and let me emphasize, this individual is a victim- has every right to feel and express any number of hostile feelings toward the perps involved and, furthermore, has the right to express his frustration at how racist behavior was openly exhibited in front of so many employees, with no consequences whatsoever. In fact, you have to wonder why none of his white colleagues stood up and objected to some of the more colorful remarks made in the presence of others. Is it really that difficult to understand why he might perceive all the whites in his office as a$$holes? His story isn't merely an indictment of a few managers, but of a culture (and yes, a white culture) that absolutely tolerated racism both at an individual and collective level. These incidents didn't only occur behind a closed door. Is or was this culture present in only one SF company?  
After what this individual was subjected to, you have to be incredibly small minded to feel offended by the fact that his language reveals frustration or antagonism toward whites.<p>By the way, I've also seen racism exhibited toward Asian immigrants- not the rockstar programmers matriculated in the US- but recent immigrants holding lower level positions.

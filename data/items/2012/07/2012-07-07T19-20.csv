I've had discussions with various people (mainly other engineers) on the topic of how one would go about starting a startup.<p>These discussions--largely theoretical--have centered around three problems:<p>1. Where?<p>2. The route to funding/profitability; and<p>3. Visa/residency issues.<p>(3) of course depends on (1) and the nationalities and residencies of the respective founders. As a UK citizen I luckily have the right to reside anywhere in the EU. For the US unfortunately I need a visa but Australians have access to the E3 visa, which has a lower bar to issuance than even the H1B (there is no need for the employer to ""prove"" they can't find someone local, which is essentially a legal circus) but there are issues in using work visas to found companies.<p>There are I believe many foreign engineers in the US in the same boat as me.<p>I've looked into the possibility of either situating in Canada or at least using it as a stepping stone. It could have a lot going for it, for example:<p>- Vancouver is relatively speaking close to Seattle and the Bay area;<p>- No health insurance problems (comparatively);<p>- Relatively low cost (compared to, say, San Francisco);<p>- English-speaking;<p>- Cultural similarities.<p>And here's where Canada really has an opportunity to attract fledgling companies: software patents. If Canada were to invalidate software patents then they'd essentially be providing a safe haven for small companies until they're large enough to defend themselves. Of course, trolls can still go after US operations (if, say, you hosted in the US) but you would be at least partially protected.<p>Sadly, the Canadian government seems to be just an inept when it comes to IP issues as other Western governments (and, worse, it seems to take its lead from the US).<p>But if you go look at the Canadian immigration sites you find out that:<p>- getting residency is relatively difficult; and<p>- engineers aren't even on the list of high-demand occupations (whereas restaurant managers are, for example).<p>Now Canadians could be concerned that if such a program existed people would use it until they could get to the US and I suspect that would happen a lot but I think that's fine because a certain percentage would stay. Some would employ Canadians, at least for a time. Some of those would go when the startup move. Some wouldn't.<p>That's how ecosystems form. It's not an exercise in being better than say Silicon Valley. Like so much else in life, it's simply an exercise in persistence and ultimately a numbers game.<p>Beyond those options I'm not sure where next someone in my shoes might otherwise go. London and Germany (I lived in Cologne for a time and loved it) are obvious choices.<p>In a bootstrapping scenario or even at a seed-funding level it would be ideal to keep costs low. Costs in the Bay Area for talent and even housing, etc are bordering nightmarish and I say this as someone who lives in Manhattan. Finding and retaining talent in SF/SV must be torture for new companies.<p>Personally I prefer New York but hey YMMV.<p>Anyway, back to Canada, it seems to have the same problem Australia does in a way: it's too focused in ripping stuff out of the ground and selling it than it is on tech. Oh well, their loss.",1341689352

Without exception, every news item on this <i>only</i> mentions the spoofing part, and not the protection part.<p>Military unmanned systems use encrypted GPS that is not vulnerable to the attack demonstrated.<p>Its possible to make a vehicle fly erratically, or even cause it to crash by spoofing GPS. But to take control requires a lot more than what was demonstrated. An error of 1us in the spoofed signal corresponds to 1000ft -- that's why the actual descriptions of the vehicle say 'banked hard' or 'veered' off course.<p>GPS jamming is so much easier than spoofing and results in the same thing.",1341689346

Closing tabs did not help either. The only response from Mozilla was 'add-ons.' Chrome does just fine with 30+ tabs open on the same machine.<p>Any organization that can live in denial for years and years about the core issue with their product is going to die. Mozilla is tightly connected to the web developer community, but has a complete disconnect from the problems facing its actual users. When Firefox shipped, it was a great, light-weight alternative to Mozilla. From my point of view as a user, I haven't seen any substantial improvements since 1.0 shipped in 2004 -- spell check is nice, and given how often it crashes, restoring tabs when the browser is opened is nice -- but that's all. Otherwise, if not for security issues and web site compatibility issues, I'd be on Firefox 1.0 (which worked fine on sub-GHz machines).<p>Aside from that, virtually all development effort has been aimed at making a better IDE for web developers.

4212405,comment,4201029,4203166,1,0,munificent,,,"The JS output that gets generated from a Dart program isn't just ""dart_size * multiplier"", it's ""dart_size * multiplier + constant"". So, when you see a tiny Dart program being compiled to a large amount of JS, that doesn't mean a large Dart program will compile to a <i>huge</i> amount of JS, it just means that the constant is dwarfing the multiplier.<p>The constant is coming from the runtime library (or, more accurately, the portions of the runtime library that your program uses). That's relatively fixed so as your Dart program gets larger, the overhead of that becomes relatively smaller. The actual code-size multiplier when going from Dart -> JavaScript is actually fairly small and getting smaller over time.<p>In some cases, we may actually compile Dart code to <i>less</i> JavaScript code because of things like dead code elimination and constant folding.<p>JavaScript code size is something that we consider a core metric for dart2js and we're constantly working to reduce it.",1341687833
4212404,comment,4211486,4212252,1,0,corin_,,,"> <i>It seems that in UK comedy at least, instead of pitching your show to commissioning editors at the channels, who probably won't understand it, you just make your own pilot</i><p>That's less common than people who pitch traditionally, but yeah there are people who do that. I think the reason it works with comedy is that often you can make a good pilot with a tiny budget, and possibly the reason it happens more in the UK than the US is that our (English) comedy is slightly less formulaic and more crazy - subjective point of view, though.<p>A couple of other examples... American sitcom ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"", the actors spent $200 shooting a pilot that they showed to networks as their pitch. The Office (original UK version) was originally a student project by Stephen Merchant, with Gervais as the only actor in it, and they then sold the show to the BBC based on that video they made. Gervais said in an interview something along the lines of ""the BBC never would have bought it based on a traditional pitch because it only makes sense and is funny when you actually see it"".",1341687813

Quite a few have left the field, and others have left the country. I've been working in the high tech sector in Ottawa for 10 years now.<p>I started out working for (big surprise) a start up telecom company as a co-op student. I loved it. Then tried the government. I wanted to kill myself. So I tried hard to stay in the private sector. I got a job at Newbridge, which had just been acquired by Alcatel, a company from France. (Alcatel is now Alcatel-Lucent). I was there when they started laying off people. It was around 2001 when things started going south. The start up I worked for went bankrupt shortly after.<p>So now I was done school. Quite a few friends from different universities had gone south to Cisco, Nvidia, etc. Meanwhile, I tried to get into QNX, but then money became an issue for them and nothing materialized. Jobless, I waited and took anything I could get my hands on, including the dreaded Government, which turned out to be OK. I told myself I'd do this until things settle down and then I'd jump right back to the private sector.<p>Boy was I wrong. Most of the people, as mentioned in the article, were still put-off by the Nortel debacle. I knew people my senior, who had 20+ years of Engineering who couldn't get hired because they had too much experience. Pretty funny. They took off to the US, eventually returning to start their own company, but swearing never to work for a big corp again. They said the were tired of making other people rich.<p>In fact, they never really cared at that point to grow a company into a giant one. They just wanted enough to enjoy life. Management in the high tech had a sort of arrogance about them. Too much of a show off in my opinion.<p>And here we are years after Nortel sunk. Nortel was full of mismanagement. Quite the ego they had. They would have keg parties almost every Friday. Where the hell was the money coming from?!?<p>The tech sector had been saturated with Engineers and Comp Sci people with the promise of big money. A dime a dozen they were. Most didn't really have what it took, but they did it for the job. We all know that's not sustainable.<p>It's as though the Canadian high tech people need to go see a Psychologist. They're stuck like a sports team who just had a bad losing streak. They love looking and emulating the US in the aesthetics and show, but don't realize that there's more to it than that. I don't know, I shouldn't speak on behalf of an entire sector, I don't know that much. But something about how they went about things.<p>Needless to say, the risk taking and drive is no longer here because most of the people that had it aren't here either. And the ones that did remain, are still a bit jaded and don't want to play that game anymore. You need risk takers, and our society is not that anymore. We've all been scared into taking the safe route. This includes myself. Yup, I changed to a different position in the government (really, really boring - but I have a baby now) and at the moment, don't plan to leave. Maybe once the mortgage is paid off, and the kid is older I'll take risks again, but until then, I'm not willing to take a risk. Working for a corporation is silly to me because you have ZERO control. That may be one reason why there aren't going to be many RIMs or Nortels coming up in Canada. People don't trust large corps anymore, so the odds of building one isn't going to get any better.<p>My 2 cents on this issue. Hopefully I'm wrong and people with guts (not like me) will take some risks. Who knows what the future holds.",1341687796

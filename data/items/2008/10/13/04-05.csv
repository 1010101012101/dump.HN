At least 60% of the time it's doing things I enjoy a great deal, though.<p>We're launching a new version of our service this week, and maybe I'll be able to cut some of that down a bit for a little while.

330754,comment,330470,330744,0,0,orianmarx,,,"No, the conflict points that are being discussed here a lot were not sufficiently important to stake the startup on at the time when we were faced with having to walk away. The real point was that by the time we went to Boston to meet with PG and get some advice, my partner had decided he could no longer trust me or my judgment and wanted to leave, and I felt the same way about him. While I wish that could have been avoided, I don't think anything that could have been done at that point would have changed the ultimate outcome for this team.<p>After spending a few months thinking ""okay, so how did it get to that point, and I didn't even realize it"" I wrote my reflections. I still think the startup has a good chance of success, but not with the dynamics that were at play then.",1223872915

My site would need to have people sign up, build a site, deploy it (at a subdomain of my site), and then manage the content and design.<p>My question is this: should I build this from scratch, or should I use Ruby on Rails or Drupal? I haven't built an app in either, so I'm not sure if one would work well in this situation. Any advice? Thanks.",1223871974

I guess my key question would be this: Given everything the startup had going for it, do you think the conflict points (networking, time commitment, and a few others) were sufficiently important to stake the startup on?<p>On the one hand you could feel in retrospect that the conflict points were important enough that the startup could never have succeeding without the direction you were pushing - so you were lucky it ended swiftly. On the other hand if you think your startup had a good chance of success even if you hadn't won those battles, then you may want to look at your conflict resolution.",1223871873

330736,comment,330525,330525,0,0,gensym,,,"This isn't surprising at all - that it would be more likely to port code from the iPhone to the desktop OS than the other way around. There are more constraints on the iPhone - especially memory, so anything that runs on the iPhone should run fine on the desktop, but not vice-versa. Moreover, it may not make economic sense to tune a piece of desktop code to fit into a small bit of memory, but if you have code that was so tuned to run on the iPhone, why not replace the untuned desktop code with it?",1223870919

If I have a foolproof system for disproving all false rumors, I still have a problem in that any true rumors will immediately be confirmed by me because I do not disprove them.<p>1) IF it is False THEN I will deny it.\n2) I did not deny it.\nC) THEREFORE, it is not False.<p>A No Comment policy, or similar, allows you to treat all rumors identically, or at least allow scope for addressing the most blatantly false while ignoring most (true and false) so as not to tacitly confirm those which are true.<p>Perhaps the policy depends on an individual's character. If there are no truths I fear, disproving all rumors will work in my favor. If I have a lot of truths to hide, disproving all false rumors but only false rumors will set me up for disaster.",1223870847

330731,comment,330139,330639,0,0,startingup,,,"You are making baseless assumptions. I was born in a very poor country, to parents neither of whom could afford to finish high school.  My worldview was shaped by a world where debt was just not an option (think loan sharks & 300%+ annual interest rates when inflation was in the 10% annual range) and mortgages simply didn't exist. If you got into debt that you couldn't repay, you got thugs at the door to collect.<p>So I am already used to much worse circumstances than the worst that is likely ahead in America. Having said that, what lies ahead for America is going to be very painful economically, even more so because Americans by and large have no recent memory of such  economic pain, so lack the ""inoculation"" that lesser societies have built up due to periodic crises.  Deep structural changes are inevitable - and such changes in the economy end up having profound cultural and social impact, some of which is unpredictable.<p>I would personally do fine both because my personal balance sheet is in fine shape and because I have a lot of inoculation. Can you say that about the average American?<p>These are the things I said we should be afraid of.",1223870614

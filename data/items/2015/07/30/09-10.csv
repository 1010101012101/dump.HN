I&#x27;d count it as a &quot;what you are&quot; type of item like a fingerprint and would just only want to use it as a username.\nI think session expiration could actually be an interesting use case. Instead of/in addition to &quot;session expires after X minutes&quot; you could expire the session after the behavioral delta is big enough.\nBut I&#x27;d assume a different login mechanism.\nCould be good session hijacking protection, especially for applications that require regular interaction anyway.<p>Love that there&#x27;s countermeasures already.

I&#x27;ve never thought I might be anything other than neurotypical, but reading the article makes me realise how many of those traits I have. I&#x27;ve always defaulted to taking people literally, to the point that friends joke about it.

My motor coordination is dreadful, and I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by categorisation and ontologies. My family have remarked that I seem unemotional, which I know is untrue, but a lot of it seems to be their alienation by what I consider to be logical behaviour.<p>I suspect this is just hypochondria, or something like it, but I guess it illustrates how subtle the idea of a spectrum can be.",1438249890

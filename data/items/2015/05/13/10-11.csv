For example, in one suburb in my city a few landlords who owned apartments started renting to &quot;undesirables&quot; - illegal aliens, prostitutes and known drug dealers.  This brought all kinds of problems because the area became known as a &quot;safe haven&quot; for petty criminals.<p>This drove down the market values of all the properties in the area, which is of course what these landlords wanted.  After people started moving out they started purchasing properties and land all over the area and when they were comfortable enough with what they had, they enlisted the help of the police to evict the undesirables (and thereafter push up rent).  With more properties under their belt, they had more say in the rate payers association, which meant they had more power to vote on things that worked in their favour rather than the original residents.  I&#x27;m sure you can see where things went from there.<p>The other side of things is also what gentrification usually implies - destruction of communities.

There are some fairly resilient network effects, mostly geographically focussed, Whatsapp, iMessage, Wechat. Wechat is just further ahead than the other networks in showing what a messaging platform can develop into, a platform, rather than merely a replacement for SMS. Naturally Wechat has also been sheltered from competition by the great firewall. So Wechat is an indispensable app if you live in China, but in the rest of the world almost no one knows that it exists. You don&#x27;t only use Wechat to chat with your friends, but also to query your bank balance, pay at McDonalds, and shop online. It&#x27;s all very weird, because the UX is chat, but if your first computer was a smart phone then it probably feels more natural.<p>Even though the switching costs between mobile messaging apps seem much lower with mobile and notifications (it&#x27;s easy to have a dozen installed), it still takes a lot to convince all your contacts to install something new. If these apps become platforms that people get used to using to using to interact with their bank or sirline it beomces harder to unseat..<p>Consider how just a few mobile apps not being available on blackberry or windows phone makes switching to these minor platforms difficult.",1431511631

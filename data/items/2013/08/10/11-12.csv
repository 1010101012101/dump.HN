And, in this particular case, it&#x27;s a little too convenient that they are taking such public and hyper-publicized action on &quot;threats&quot; that do appear to be easily foiled. Because a.) the plotters allowed themselves to be intercepted even with so much recent publicity around our programs (btw, so much for the number one argument that whistleblowers like Snowden help the enemy) and b.) simply closing a few embassies nullified the threat. And, oh, BTW, let&#x27;s make sure that our PR machine (read CNN and others) repeatedly mention that we all have the good ol&#x27; NSA to thank.<p>Sorry, I just don&#x27;t see how this goes down easily for anyone.<p>><i>The real question though is if prevented attacks would have been prevented anyway without this evidence, or in general if the price is worth paying.</i><p>In this case, I don&#x27;t believe there was an imminent threat. I think it was  propaganda. But, on a broader level, I think your questions are valid for those inclined to believe we should trade freedom/privacy/etc for security (i.e. most Americans).  But, surely the answer is in large part a function of whether and how many &quot;effective&quot; threats are really out there vs. just evil people.<p>So, your &quot;real question&quot; is unanswerable at this point on a general level. We don&#x27;t know who the threats are and, in fact, they are intent on keeping this secret for &quot;security reasons&quot;. It is the quintessential bogeyman. We must simply trust that these threats exist and are of a scale that warrant the massive security apparatus/surveillance state that we have erected.",1376135706

Boosters can&#x27;t seem to help but pitch the things they care about rather than the things the listener does. Maybe it feels satisfying, but it&#x27;s no way to attract converts.<p>A more effective approach would be to choose common tasks people perform in other languages and demonstrate how they can be less (error-prone, time-consuming, verbose) in Haskell.<p>For instance, I recall reading about a Haskell Web framework where the compiler guarantees user-generated content never makes it into any served HTML unsanitized.

He&#x27;s saying things that are both true and not true, or true and beside the point.<p>For example, &quot;No domestic spying program&quot; may be 100% true. It&#x27;s a foreign spying program that&#x27;s devouring domestic data because of where the data is tapped and how data flows, then having the data shared domestically outside the program.<p>Any time government officials are commenting here, the adjectives and adverbs -- okay, even verbs and nouns -- are being used as qualifiers to eke out a &quot;technically true but in a practical sense false&quot; statement.<p>In another example, when he says &quot;nobody&#x27;s reading your emails&quot; that&#x27;s true for all but a handful of his listeners.

Our laptops and devices store personal information and it&#x27;s critical that we are all educated on how the internet works and how our laptops work in general.<p>I love teaching but I am not a teacher.

Put most/all application logic into const/pure functions, and then have a separate set of interaction functions, i.e. just pull out that one bit of Haskell philosophy from the rest of the language design.<p>Speculative guesses as to what might stand in the way:<p>1. The lack of a purity-tracking mechanism like Haskell&#x27;s may make programming in this style in C more complex and error-prone.<p>2. The fact that C compilers don&#x27;t expect you to use this programming style may mean they don&#x27;t optimize common operations in the way Haskell does; for example, if you do manipulations on large arrays in a functional rather than imperative style, Haskell will optimize away a lot of the temporary arrays, but C compilers may not.",1376133473

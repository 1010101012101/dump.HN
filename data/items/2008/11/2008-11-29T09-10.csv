There's no evidence that he believes anything else, given the disconnect between his lifestyle and what he advocates for others. There is absolutely no reason (it's not like he can't afford it) that he couldn't be powering that mansion of his with wind or solar, and that's just one example. There's no reason that the profits from his carbon credit company couldn't be spent on alternative energy research. The <i>evidence</i> is that it's all self-promotion.",1227952297

Dropping out and doing something is fine, but getting in in the first place will mean less time wasted later convincing people to take you seriously.",1227951663

Think of Arches, Bryce, Zion, Joshua Tree, etc.  I certainly think Texas and Iowa would be better off with more national parks.  The original tall prairie grass ecosystem is mostly gone from the midwest.  I'd like to see some of that.",1227951389

380011,comment,379379,379815,0,0,cturner,,,"There's an opportunity cost to everything you do. So if you prioritise carbon emissions and the result of that is that poor people can't keep their families warm, you lose. Most of the evils of politics in the first world happens as opportunity-cost theft, because it's easy to hide. For example - force people to pay taxes, enlarge government in the process, and then fund something stupid and thereby prevent the original person from putting it to better use.<p>> Whichever side of the argument you fall [..]<p>Be that as it may, if it develops as a result to market impetus you can be generally confident that it will be a response to actual demand. Whereas as soon as the government gets involved we lose our valuing mechanisms and get locked into what the geniuses in the capital think is going to happen. Also, it depends which fuels you pour your energy into and whether this is actually a good choice. If you invest in a bad route there for political reasons (e.g. ethanol) you'll have the effect of increasing world hunger as a side-effect. Nuclear is another option which is difficult to separate from political concerns.",1227949620

I doubt it.<p>However, I really appreciate the sheer lack of original journalism that came from ordinary citizens during this time...  I think only one or two people were reporting from ground zero... Pretty much everyone else was just echoing the main media. That is a problem that needs a solution...<p>A serious collective of amateur journalists doing some serious journalism and not just echoing the established media would be a great thing to have.  No idea, how that could be achieved but if it existed during this mayhem, it would have been the resource I would be glued to, not the maddening sensationalist sickening reporting of the news channels.",1227949256

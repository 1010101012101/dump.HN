I hated it, I loved visiting the city.  I moved to the city as soon as I could, and moved to bigger cities and other countries.  That said the appeal of living in the countryside would always tempt me.  Recently I was working remotely, so we decided to move to a nice big house in the country, outside of a village of a few hundred people.  It was nice, but remote and lonely and after 6 months we&#x27;re happy to be back in a city again, in a well connected part of a city where we can easily choose between going into the city centre or being outside of the city.",1430834249

It&#x27;s not about the complexity of code or any measure thereof, but a simple communication issue.<p>Telling someone that their code is too complex can very easily be interpreted as a personal affront, especially by more junior developers. It can very easily communicate that they are a shitty developer and don&#x27;t know what they are doing. When that happens you will get nowhere.<p>In that situation, the other person feels that they have to defend themselves. They get myopic and unable to see whatever argument you present. They simply will not accept it, or if they do they will resent you for it.<p>The best way to go about it is to acknowledge their efforts and validate their thinking. Look at why the code is the way it is, and try and understand why it&#x27;s written that way. Approach the situation not as &quot;I am right, you are wrong&quot; but as &quot;I don&#x27;t understand this part, can you explain it to me.&quot; When they explain and you think it&#x27;s complex say something like &quot;Ah, yes! That&#x27;s what I thought it did. It seemed a bit complex so I was wondering if it did anything else.

My friends all got to do cool stuff like skateboard and go to the mall. I had to have a milk cow instead. I couldn&#x27;t wait to grow up and get away and live in a city. I was going to be an electrical engineer. Instead I became an agronomist. I worked on some different types of farms and although it was OK it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to think all day at work, not just exist and do the same thing season after season. I always loved computers and had ever since my first TSR-80. I started playing around with HTML. Then I learned Python and Javascript. Then I started writing more complex programs. Then I decided I wanted to do it full time about 4 years ago and quite my job as a land reclamation specialist. My boss was quite surprised... he knew I was &quot;good with computers&quot; but I was going to be a programming nerd? I got some contract jobs. Then I got a full time job as a web developer. I love it. Every day I&#x27;m clean, I sit in a comfortable chair in a climate controlled environment and I play with computer code.

[1]<p>This is the sort of thing I meant. Dig back into the first post and it&#x27;s clear that this person was very interested in coding as a hobby, but that it didn&#x27;t translate as a career. A bit of <i>dis</i>couragement, or at least, something that most people who are gung-ho about encouraging people in, in, in to coding would <i>consider</i> discouragement but perhaps also could just be called &quot;realism&quot;, could well have saved this person a lot of pain and suffering. Mindless encouragement is not a virtue... it must be mind<i>ful</i>.<p>I am where I belong. I&#x27;ve done farming and gardening and it does <i>nothing</i> for me, for a variety of reasons. I would (and I suppose, do) pay not to do it. This would be a horrifying career change for me. But I am grateful that I am a statistically-crazy guy who actually loves this almost inhuman job of programming, grateful that I get to do this crazy stuff that few other people really <i>want</i> to do, and they can go do stuff that I don&#x27;t want to do. Real diversity is great.<p>Be careful about encouragement, and be honest about the whole package. There are people out there who are natural programmers (or other technical positions), and don&#x27;t know it yet. There are people out there who think it&#x27;s a good idea, and really shouldn&#x27;t do it. There are people out there who don&#x27;t know about programming, and don&#x27;t need to because it isn&#x27;t for them, and somebody <i>really</i> needs to come talk to them about the virtues of plumbing, or how much charity work they could do. There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of people out there who should be introduced to what computers can do for you as a hobby or an adjunct to another career but don&#x27;t need to be &quot;programmers&quot;. You can&#x27;t perfectly predict, and ultimately everyone&#x27;s responsible for their own decisions anyhow, but be thoughtful about what you say.

I think I&#x27;ve done a decent job of explaining the root comment, but as of now the paragraph has a down vote to -4.  So, I&#x27;m very curious:  Is it the suggestion that Tor operators take some moral high ground in the case of users of their Tor infrastructure who are participating in the trafficking of children, or terrorists who are utilizing Tor near-anonymity to prepare for their next attack?  Or, is it the idea that I am suggesting that any involvement be had at all?<p>Because, while I started the proposition as pointing to cooperation with law enforcement as the right thing to do if approached for questioning as a Tor operator when malicious persons are bring tracked on your network, I offered alternatives to that such as booting off the users, ejecting their data, so forth.<p>Does one simply create tools like Tor and then walk away, let the tools do what they do, and let others be responsible for dealing with the negative aspects?<p>I think this is an interesting conundrum and parallel in some fashion to the gun industry defense arguments here in America.  Keep in mind, I am a builder of Tor servers - it is a software application, and like a gun, not illegal here in America.  This difficult idea I&#x27;m presenting here of having some ownership of who uses your Tor infrastructure is not something I present lightly.<p>This is a valuable conversation and I&#x27;d love to hear more perspectives.",1430832944

I find it helpful to remember that A: among the set of people I really wish would code better is my past self, at times even as recently as last week and B: there are certainly plenty of other people who wish that I would code better, for their personal definition of &quot;better&quot;. In fact, I know that even as my code tends towards the &quot;simple&quot; side and I find some people&#x27;s overcomplicated, they consider my code oversimple.

For the quorum you usually want 3, 5 or 7 members, while your application could be anywhere from one to hundreds of instances.  Your quorum members must always know how many other members are supposed to be in the quorum, while your application could remove or add instances on the fly.

For me also, a distro is measured by how easily I can get my preferred desktop environment and regularly-used apps.<p>I am at the level where I can self-solve all my own problems, but if you are a beginner then stick with one of the major distros. Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distros like Mint can&#x27;t be beat for the sheer size of their community. Any problem you have, someone else has hit it before, they probably solved it too.<p>Arch Linux is a great learning experience, you really learn what the components of your system do, how they work, and how they interact together. Everyone should use Arch for a while as they become intermediate Linux users. Eventually maintaining your Arch system becomes a chore which eats into your &quot;computer stuff&quot; time.<p>Once you&#x27;re at this level, you know what software you want, and you know how most of it works under the hood. Distros are now just different boot screens with different things pre-packaged and different things available in their repos. Use whichever distro provides what you need and gives you the least drama.",1430831374

9492207,comment,9491313,9491661,0,0,brudgers,,,"For context, Erlang is designed for building highly reliable fault tolerant systems, things like telecom switches that may run for many years without rebooting or powering down or failing. &quot;Fail&quot; like &quot;error&quot; and &quot;fault&quot; have specific technical meanings when talking about such systems. A fault causes the system to enter a problematic state, the problematic state is an error, if the problematic state causes the system not to perform its intended function then the system fails.<p>What the article is getting at is adding an error handler that&#x27;s not in the  specification keeps the system in an unspecified state [or transitions the system into a different unspecified state depending on how you look at it].<p>Well, I guess there&#x27;s another piece of context: it&#x27;s probably best to treat systems as algebraically closed in that combining two systems produces another system and so forth [1]. This means that when a specific system crashes (and &quot;crashing&quot; is not a technical term in the context) the larger system may be designed to handle the error. With proper encapsulation, there&#x27;s no way for the crashed system to &quot;know&quot; what&#x27;s going on above it or what&#x27;s best...without a specification.<p>In other words, the assumption for such systems is that if a system is supposed to handle an error then the specification would say so. High reliability fault tolerant systems aren&#x27;t built with cowboy coding.  The software expresses the design and while some systems are such that failing results in failing to delight someone with a piano playing cat, other systems are such that when they fail 911 calls are missed and people die. In those cases, the author is suggesting when you don&#x27;t know, don&#x27;t guess.<p>[1]: <i>52.

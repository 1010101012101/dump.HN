(That&#x27;s notable in Tokyo, as most are not -- a combination of high traffic, poor power/wifi situations, and the staff not being pleased with someone holding a table for extended periods.)<p>The one which I know off the top of my head is Nakameguro Lounge, about one minute from Nakameguro Station.  The effective price per hour is 600 to 1,000 yen.  Also their lunch menu is really fantastic for only about 1,200 yen.<p>Also, as it is about two minutes from my apartment, if you&#x27;re ever passing through Tokyo drop me a line and your coffee/lunch is on me.",1429761561

But if a candidate said that he was familiar with bind() but would avoid it for the sake of compatibility with IE6 that at least shows familiarity with it.

For example, there are people with disabilities who can&#x27;t take trains.  There are workers who live in areas of Queens or Brooklyn not covered well by the Subway.  There are tourists who want to drive into the city from neighboring states.<p>I speak from personal experience.  I personally hate driving into the city but I&#x27;m aware of many people/situations who for all practical purposes must.",1429758348

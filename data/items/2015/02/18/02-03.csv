It&#x27;s also our go to tool for ad-hoc querries of production databases (essentialy a SQL gui).<p>Excel (and other spreadsheet packages like Calc) are good for non technical users it&#x27;s useful for rapidly prototyping stuff but it is absolutely a pain for automation and any type of statistical heavy lifting. Once a spreadsheet reaches a certain level of complexity it becomes a pain to support and maintain much better to have a real database driving things.<p>I&#x27;ve heard a lot about R which is kind of an open-source version of SAS (at least the statistical parts) not sure what its automation and reporting support is like my limited understanding is it doesn&#x27;t have the BI parts.",1424228380

The most important thing that is wrong with it is the badly or &#x27;un-designed&#x27; core of the language. This result of this is that when you are implementing modern programming constructs, you won&#x27;t be able to implement it in a consistent way (Most of the time the implementers does not care, but even if you do you ill see quickly running out of options.). So the modern features PHP get are often half-baked so that if you try to put it to real use, it ll come to a grinding halt.<p>Another aspect of this &#x27;un-designed&#x27; core is that there will be a big fight over introduction of any &#x27;core-like&#x27; feature. And often implementers wont be able to go with one philosophy and is forced to make everyone happy, ending up with very weird behaviors in the implementation.<p>Another thing is Exceptions. Because the exceptions was not available from the start, only a part of the language uses them. So you cannot rely on exceptions being thrown in a consistent way.<p>Another important thing is the most people who have been working on the language are hobbists and students with no sort of professional experience, and they end up implementing the features in the most awkward fashion (Eg: Methods on the datetime object mutating it).<p>One could go on and on and on..<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/lolphp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/lolphp</a>",1424227877

Still, &quot;creating a support burden&quot; basically means &quot;making more work for the developer,&quot; while &quot;updating&quot; almost always means &quot;making more work for the user.&quot;  I happen to use Emacs, and even though it&#x27;s very slow-moving and careful about backward compatibility, I always put aside some free time for major updates, because they always break my setup somehow.  And I&#x27;m lucky compared to the average software user: I&#x27;m a coder, so I can usually work around the breakage without too much trouble.  Regularly making work for people without this option is inhumane.<p>Regarding ignorance, you know far more about how the systems work, but they probably know far more about how they use them.<p>I still think the auto-update treadmill is a symptom of developer arrogance, laziness, and callousness, but maybe I&#x27;m just old before my time.",1424227833

I fully believe that she was treated differently when she wore dresses versus stereotypical tech clothes, I believe she (to paraphrase) got skeezed on by a bunch of dudes, and I totally believe that people mistook her for a recruiter.<p>I believe basically all the facts that she wrote in the article and I have no problems with them.  That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m arguing.  Her experience is ABSOLUTELY VALID!<p>What I don&#x27;t necessarily believe is her assertion that being treated differently because she wore a dress or a kimono is ipso facto sexism.  I think it&#x27;s entirely possible that guys who don&#x27;t adhere to the &quot;company tee shirt and pants&quot; dress code get treated differently as well.  There are a lot of programmers (both male and female) that use &quot;suits&quot; as a derogatory term for business people, often in part because they dress differently, and often because that difference in values is made apparent by their attire.<p>The point is if PG says &quot;we didn&#x27;t get the deal&quot; that&#x27;s a fact and there&#x27;s no problem with it.<p>If he says &quot;we didn&#x27;t get the deal and they said it&#x27;s because we weren&#x27;t a big enough company&quot; that&#x27;s probably a fact and it&#x27;s easy to swallow.<p>If he says &quot;we didn&#x27;t get the deal because we&#x27;re too young and hip for those old fuddy-duddies&quot; that&#x27;s moved from the realm of fact to speculation and I would analyze that just the same.<p>> She&#x27;s obviously not wearing hot pants, a bikini top to work, and even if that were the case, she would be notified in an official capacity in short order (e.g. &quot;told to go home&quot;) -- not &quot;complimented&quot; repeatedly in a creepy way.<p>I totally believe that all this happened, but it&#x27;s probably less sexism and more that she&#x27;s young and attractive.  It might be sexual harassment, but unless these guys are skeezing on every woman irrespective of her looks and age, it&#x27;s not really sexism.  That doesn&#x27;t make it OK!  It&#x27;s still unacceptable behavior and I wouldn&#x27;t condone it.  But calling it sexism isn&#x27;t really accurate either.<p>>  It isn&#x27;t about what&#x27;s possible, if you want to be analytical about it.. it&#x27;s the likelihood.<p>Agreed completely!  Here&#x27;s a quote:<p>&quot;I noticed I got better feedback from interviewers when I “looked the part.”&quot;<p>That means that people are evaluating her by what she wore (which she has a choice in) not by her biology (which she does not).  To me, that&#x27;s not sexism.  It might be somewhere between unfortunate and criminal depending on who you ask, but again not sexist.",1424227485

As I understand it, you&#x27;re offering this service so other people can write consumer apps for banking, and companies can integrate the API into their internal systems. I have just a couple of questions..<p>1. What are your thoughts on dealing with fraud? While ACH is often reversible, wire transfers tend not to be. Established banks often have convoluted wire procedures (that often involve showing up in person at a branch) precisely because a fraudulent transfer -- even if the fraud was the user&#x27;s fault because of phished credentials -- often results in the bank eating the losses. How will your company handle losses where somebody&#x27;s API credentials got hacked, their balance transferred to Romania, and the victim notices and reports the fraud 59 days later?<p>2. One of the biggest limiting factors in bitcoin&#x27;s growth right now is that exchanges struggle to get and keep relationships with traditional banks. No-doubt fraud prevention has a lot to do with this, but any bank that steps up to the plate could charge its partner exchanges huge fees and still be swimming in business. Have you thought about being that bank?",1424227140

Because Lockheed had\ndeveloped the F-117, and it flew into the\nBaghdad anti-aircraft means and supposedly\nnever got even a single scratch.<p>Lesson:  Given the assumption that Gulf War I\nwas to be fought, we really, really like\nthe F-117.<p>The F-22?  No doubt there are scenarios where\nits superiority would be similar.<p>Broadly it appears that the US has <i>military\nplanners</i> sitting around evaluating what\npotential enemies might be able to do and, then,\ncoming up with military R&D programs to\nkeep the US ahead.  Then, if the stuff the\nUS develops is sufficiently superior, say, \nlike the F-117 or the SR-71,\nthen the chances of actual shooting go way down\nand the superior US weapons in effect\ndid the best we could hope for.<p>Now, for the cost of an F-22, likely that\nis heavily for just its crucial attribute --\nbeing way ahead as technology.

Now if we have\nto fight a war, then that&#x27;s how we want\nto fight it.<p>Or, once General Schwarzkopf\nwas asked what happened to those\nmany thousands of Iraqi\nsoldiers out in the Iraqi desert\ndefending against an attack from\nSaudi Arabia?

Strings are Kolmogorov Random when they can not possibly be compressed any further by any program: Kolmogorov Random strings simply have no predictable information left to use for further compression. But Kolmogorov Complexity (KC) can not be computed, since that causes a paradox, much like &quot;A description of the natural number that can not be described in less than fifty English words&quot;.<p>But we can of course talk about a degree of randomness, like we can also try to approach KC. Good randomness is all about unpredictability (given the first half of a random string, can you use that to predict the second half?), but that does not mean that proper randomness should be void of identifiable patterns (such as &quot;00000000111111111&quot; in a random binary string). Such orderly-looking patterns do appear in proper randomness, because the absence of those patterns would make the randomness more predictable, not less.<p>You can measure level of randomness with statistical methods [1], compression [2], visual methods [3] and die-hard tests [4]<p>[1] A simple method is the chi-square test.<p>[2] Compression ratio tells us something about the randomness. Random data can not be compressed by everyday-use compressors. That no one claimed the money for the challenge to compress RAND&#x27;s digits in a binary file tells us something about the rigor that team had in coming up with random numbers. The more you can compress a string, the more order it contains and the more predictable it is.<p>[3] You can plot random points inside a circle. After a lot of points are added, you should see no patterns and a properly, evenly spaced circle. Another method are Moiré patterns: Take a field of random noise, copy it, slightly rotate it, and overlay. Non-random patterns will become more visible. But these patterns are visible without Moiré rotation too when using very basic PRNG&#x27;s like the standard Python random library.<p>[4] The programmer&#x27;s way of brute-forcing a lot of simulation runs to see if the PRNG works as expected: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests</a>",1424225458

9066589,comment,9062176,9066186,0,0,rbehrends,,,"There are problems with Git&#x27;s &quot;object soup&quot; approach, too. For example:<p>(1) The performance issues with &quot;git blame&quot; appear to be essentially unfixable. That tradeoff is by design [1]. Note that by &quot;performance issues&quot; I mean that git blame can take several minutes on some repositories (e.g. src/xdisp.c in Emacs).<p>(2) Git is pretty much tied to a 1:1 repository:directory model and cannot safely support a 1:1 branch:directory model with multiple branch checkouts sharing a repository (git-new-workdir as the closest approximation is not safe).<p>In general, a lot of operations on Git have an O(branch history size) or even O(repo size) complexity; that is not a problem if you do not need them, but it puts limits on what you can do efficiently with Git (at least without adequate caching and the necessary porcelain to use it).<p>That, of course, on top of the other criticism typically targeted at Git (poorly designed command line interface, difficult to understand internal model [2], possibility of data loss [3], etc.).<p>> Mercurial is dead, but its fans just haven&#x27;t noticed yet.<p>Not everybody here is concerned with the silly Git vs. Mercurial war (the modern version of Emacs vs. Vi). My personal concern is that the result of widespread Git adoption is that VCS development has stalled and has settled for a &quot;good enough&quot; that I don&#x27;t really consider good enough; Mercurial is interesting not because they&#x27;re doing things better (though they do some things better, and other things worse), but because they appear to be the one team still actually experimenting with new things (e.g., changeset evolution). I really wish there were more going on with Bazaar (which is basically in maintenance mode now, and Canonical doesn&#x27;t even seem to put a whole lot of effort into that, with lots of bugs still outstanding) or Fossil (which is mostly trying to be conservative rather than innovative [4]).<p>In short: Competition is good, monoculture is bad. The desire to have one VCS to &quot;rule them all&quot; worries me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=git&m=116991865311836"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=git&m=116991865311836</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/sperezde/onward13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.csail.mit.edu/sperezde/onward13.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://jenkins-ci.org/content/summary-report-git-repository-disruption-incident-nov-10th"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jenkins-ci.org/content/summary-report-git-repository-...</a><p>[4] Which is a worthy goal in itself, but it also means that they aren&#x27;t really moving VCS development forward.",1424224968

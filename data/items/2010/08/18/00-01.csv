""In a startup offering on-line marketing to restaurant owners I contacted every restaurant in San Francisco and booked 100.000 revenues for our services"" is an example of a specific thing that you did, that brought value to a startup and a many people (e.g. me) would not be comfortable doing.<p>Second is to offer your ideas tailored to a specific person.

1612864,comment,1610824,1611900,0,0,neilk,,,"> If you can stop working tomorrow and maintain your present lifestyle - I consider that wealthy.<p>Even for most rich people, stopping work would require some adjustments. Tom Wolfe documented this pretty well in <i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i>. A bond trader loses his job and has to live on his savings. He acknowledges that he could still live like a king if he just moved out of his Park Avenue apartment, but ""going backwards"" is just socially inconceivable. He'd have to quit the club that all his wife's friends are members of, etc. etc.<p>However, I agree to some extent with your definition of rich. I just note that 'present lifestyle' is also a variable here. This is why adjusting your expectations provides, in a certain sense, the best ROI possible. It costs nothing and you can become fabulously wealthy as a result.",1282090688

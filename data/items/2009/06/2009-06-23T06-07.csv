It's the social game apps and similar trivial things that do well on facebook & social networks.  You got to realize what people use facebook for.  And there is a bit of a chicken and egg review db problem there.  You got to get 20 of your friends to start using the ""Food"" app hardcore.",1245739923

""Quiet down kids, it's in the mail, should be here this afternoon, just hold it..""<p>You have to be kidding me.<p>The selling point must be that it's cumbersome to carry toilet paper out of the supermarket??<p>It's like those infomercials where you see people that can't figure out how to use a blanket because it doesn't have sleeves.<p>Alice.com is just a ""blanket with sleeves"" to me until they can deliver EVERYTHING.<p>(Side note: I read that the blanket with sleeves sold pretty well, so maybe Alice.com DOES have a chance.... maybe)",1245738658

The PR2's arm is a pretty impressive piece of hardware.  Their navigation was a little buggy when I saw it, and from the milestone video it looks like it's still not quite there.  Glad to see they finally hit the self-charging milestone though.<p>I don't think the article mentioned this (may have missed it) but WG will be building several (10?) PR2's and loaning them out for free to research labs.  Their business model is basically ""encourage and support open source robotics now so that we can bring forward the point at which we can all start making money off it"".",1245737393
669929,comment,669818,669818,0,0,patio11,,,"Lemon/penny batteries could power the entire world, too.  Here's the math:<p>One lemon/penny battery generates 0.0001 W.  Thus, one kilowatt requires 10 megalemons.  10 megalemons produces 365 * 24 = 8760 kilowatt hours per year, or 876 KWH per megalemon per year.<p>The US consumes roughly 4 trillion KWH per year, which would require about 4.5 petalemon to power.  Worldwide production last year was on the order of 6.5 gigalemons (13 megatonnes according to Wiki, 200g for the average lemon), so we have a bit to go, but this proves that a significant fraction of the US's electrical needs can be provided by lemon batteries currently.  Minor implementation details such as maintenance of the lemon batteries, storage of them, operating lifetime, cost, and trivialities such as ""Where do we find 4.5 petapennies?"" can be hammered out at a later date.<p>(P.S. Less sarcastically, if you want to generate the world's electricity needs without being primarily reliant on fossil fuels, you have two options.  The first is nuclear power.  The second is dividing the world into permanent camps: those that have sufficient access to electricity to enjoy a standard of living comparable to America in the early 1900s, and those who do not.  Group #2 will have to vastly outnumber Group #1.)",1245737331

It's actually working pretty well so far.<p>The key realisation is that there are several aspects of me that can be brought up. Daniel-the-heavy-sleeper doesn't give a damn about alarm clocks, work, commitments, etc, and will stay in bed at every opportunity. Daniel-the-hacker, on the other hand, has no problems doing difficult stuff that requires a log of willpower. So the question is, how do I get Daniel-the-hacker to wake up, rather than the other guy.<p>My latest solution: set up a TED talk as an alarm clock. Since those talks are almost all very interesting, it immediately brings out the higher Daniel in me, who likes to pay attention to the interesting points being made. This Daniel has no problem making a decision to stay awake long enough to have a caffeinated drink (a Red Bull at the moment, but I might switch back to coffee, depending), which pretty much guarantees I'll wake up fully.<p>And of course there is the secondary but important advantage of watching one new mind-expanding TED talk every day...",1245737061

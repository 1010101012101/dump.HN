Maybe it only kicks in when you install from the recovery partition? But why?<p>I completely forgot to check whether the GM install app still includes the installer DMG and I apparently cant check anymore since that app was apparently deleted after I installed the update. That didnt happen before. Since Im nervous without that DMG Im going to download Lion from the App Store again (that works but it takes time).<p>Edit: I just checked, the recovery partition is only 650MB. You are re-downloading the whole or large parts of the installer (3.75GB in size) when installing from the recovery partition. Apple checks whether you can re-download Lion. (The same happens when you re-download Lion from the App Store.)<p>I guess if you really want you can call this activation but I dont really know how Apple should do it differently. Your Mac sends a request to a Server somewhere in order to download the installer. Im fairly certain that without any activation it would be very simple to fake such a request and just download the installer at will. It would be no different from Apple putting Lion on a public server somewhere, for everyone to download. The only way to prevent this is  as far as I know  to do some kind of verification. What they could maybe do is to already put parts of the installer on the recovery partition, that way whatever is downloaded from Apples servers wouldnt work without a recovery partition (which you can only get if you at one point had the Lion installer app). Im, however, not sure thats worth the trouble.<p>When you install from the installer app (I dont know whether a clean install is possible if you do that, probably not) and when you install using the DMG inside the installer app bundle (its still there in the Lion GM) your installation is not verified.<p>That makes sense, I guess.",1309559132

2720376,comment,2719503,2719664,7,0,webjprgm,,,"A ""relation"" is the fundamental concept in relational databases. When they say ""set based"" they really mean ""relation based"" as far as I can tell from their site. So this is essentially a relational database that replaces SQL with their bandicoot language.<p>Stralep asked ""But why are relational types limited only to be composed of primitive types?"". Well, most SQL-based databases are like that, and you link separate relations together using foreign keys.  It would be an interesting feature if they made it hold hierarchies of objects, but then, that reduces the ability to perform relational algebra operations because you'd be hiding parts of your relations in those nested structures. That becomes an SQL vs NoSQL debate. Object Store vs. relational data.<p>I notice that they have a very simple distributed mechanism. You can have many instances of ""executors"" (the interpreter / computation handler) and of ""volume"" (data storage and access), but just one transaction manager.  Seems pretty simple.  What I want to know is how this compares to the speed and scalability of MySQL.  Do I want to start replacing my MySQL servers with bandicoot?<p>It also occurred to me that you essentially have a stored-procedures-only system here. You can call any function via http but you can't execute arbitrary queries.  Aside from that, I don't see any built-in security other than placing this behind a firewall if you want to limit it to only back-end server use in your PHP/Ruby/Java/Arc/etc. applications.  You will have to edit the bandicoot code file in conjunction with your web app code to incorporate all the queries you need, but that separation of concerns could be considered a good thing.",1309559016

For a while her comments were filled with hateful attacks against her as a person, and many saying they had come from Gruber's site.  They were removed, but they were the types of personal attacks you'd expect from a 1960s civil rights protest, but not because someone didn't add explicit attribution (because clearly running the story with a web link isn't enough).<p>One of his last lines is this, ""Defensiveness is never flattering.""

I'd say you should at most randomly give away free inbox cleanings to your followers / people who tweet about the service.

Facebook defined connections to others with the term. Google+ doesn't define your mom's relationships - your mom does.</i><p>The naming of the relationship is a really neat point. Even if you're not your mom and use Facebook to connect with colleagues or acquaintances or investors, they're still weighed down by the baggage of the word 'friend.' Whether or not Facebook has the ability to share with separate groups of people, they're all called the same thing. There's a mental tax here when you have to convert: friends from school, friends from the bar, friends from work, wait, no, <i>colleagues</i> from work.<p>Similarly, Twitter has no labels of importance: you're following someone's tweets, but there's no implied relationship. Lists are one way to add semantic meaning, but you don't use them with the same regularity as your main timeline.<p>Features aside, Google+ strikes a neat balance here with just the ability to <i>label</i> your relationships.

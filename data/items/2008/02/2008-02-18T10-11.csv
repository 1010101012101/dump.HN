[1] Is uNoodle trying to do too much at once?  There is another problem with this approach. Startups make new things using Ideas so new that historical data points are no real predictors of success. So how predict such Startups are going to succeed?<p>Make no mistake, though. The real target for these guys is to set themselves up as middle men for VCs.

However, this ignores the societal implications of atheism and religiousness.<p>I think atheism is more the philosophy of the self sufficient than the non self sufficient.  So, people who would be atheists if they had the means end up not being atheists when they do not (at least in the general case).  However, the converse is not true of being religious.  Therefore, the religious label can encompass a wider range of people.",1203332013

118060,comment,117588,117850,0,0,xirium,,,"It may be possible to retreive the data without openning a drive. I can think of two methods for achieving this objective. Firstly, I've seen reference to SCSI commands to retrieve ""unbaked"" sectors from CDROMs. Support for this functionality varies but it may be possible that some harddisks have undocumented functionality. You may wish to check the widespread implementation of DRM in harddisks for circumstantial evidence of such functionality. Alternatively, it may be possible to replace harddisk firmware which allows retrieval of magnetic traces. Again, I've seen reference to ""low-level formatting"" which wipes harddisk firmware. If the firmware is accessible in this manner then retreival is possible for almost all harddisks without openning them. It would also demonstrate that data recovery services are doing a shoddy job of imaging disks, running some standard recovery tools, and maybe performing some sector edits.<p>This test raises the bar because you have three days and writing to the disk is not allowed. That would leave you with three days to reverse engineer the existing firmware.",1203330794

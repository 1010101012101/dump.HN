3506,comment,3492,3500,0,0,JoeEntrepreneur,,,"You are right. But in order to get the first users, don't you think people need to know that there is something called Onista that exists?",1173584489
3505,comment,3447,3447,0,0,drop19,,,"I'm halfway through Founders at Work and the conclusion I am getting is an overwhelming yes.  The chapter on Hotmail is pretty illuminating -- nobody else they talked to thought web-based e-mail was remotely a good idea.",1173584469
3504,comment,3492,3497,0,0,JoeEntrepreneur,,,"Same thing happened to www.riya.com as well I guess.\nI signed up for their Release, and was waiting for them to release. When they released, I noticed that it sucked. So I never used it again.",1173584438
3503,comment,3492,3492,0,0,JoeEntrepreneur,,,"Well Onista (http://www.onista.com) is a social marketplace where anybody can buy or sell anything and also socialize, create friends and never worry about paying any listing fees, commission, auctions. It would be very simple.<p>I was reading this article about ""8 Simple Steps to Build Traffic For Your Internet Startup"" @ http://www.scoreboard-media.com/internet-startup-traffic/ and was trying to understand, but some of the stuff I could not really follow.\nLike ""What is defensible traffic"". Also it says ""Build links"". But then how to build links?\nI do not mind spending money on having Press Release, but I do not know when is the right time to have one, and also who can assist me in writing a press-release. (My Written English sucks more than MC Hammer's accountant).<p>When you said, ""end your beta announcement mail to, say, 10 people or 50 people"". Should those be my friends and contacts or I can buy email list from somewhere. No Idea.\nI already sent email to my friends and contacts and so far 29 ppl have signed up to see when I release the product.",1173584328
3502,comment,3447,3447,0,0,lak,,,"It's certainly true for my startup.  I've been advertising my ideas for years, hoping someone else would do all the work, but in desperation I'm now building a company to produce the software I was hoping someone else would make.<p>Look at Google -- they tried to sell their algorithm so they could stay in school, but no one was interested, so they had to put up or shut up.  If a bunch of people already thought your idea was a good idea, it'd effectively be a mature space.",1173583674
3501,comment,3487,3487,0,0,pg,,,"It's so hilarious the way they keep this stuff at arm's length. They can't say tag cloud without scare quotes (I'm with them there) and yet *they're making one*.",1173583578
3500,comment,3492,3492,0,0,pg,,,"I don't think creating buzz prior to launch is that necessary for most startups.  The question is more how to get a lot of people to the site after there's something to do there.",1173583028

3498,comment,3098,3445,0,0,Harj,,,"that sounds cool. we've all been so wrapped up in investor day we've not organized anything for startup school by way of meetups. keep me posted on what you plan.",1173582369
3497,comment,3492,3492,0,0,Harj,,,"creating buzz is not necessarily a good thing. the first product you launch will be bad because it hasn't had user input (nothing compares to real users using your site). it will become incrementally better as more people tell you how they actually want it to work.<p>taking the pre-launch buzz approach is high risk. take powerset for example - they have generated so much buzz that their product had better be a google killer from day one or they're in trouble.",1173582272

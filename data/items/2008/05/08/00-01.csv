There is nothing wrong with that and it is perfectly natural. But you gotta love yourself first, or the rest of the stuff is going to feel empty.<p>So what I am saying is -- are you doing what you are doing because YOU love it, or because you think you can get other people to love you by doing it? Did you go to concerts and parties because you liked the music and the beer, or did you go because you wanted people to think you are cool for going? Do you want to start coding again because you love the joy of creation, because you love discovering the elegance in ideas, or are you doing it because you weren't able to be accepted by ""mainstream"" society and you are now trying to get approval again from a different group?",1210207912

That includes a lot more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.<p>>It may be easier to say what that doesn't include. It doesn't include most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. It doesn't include videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. Basically, if they'd cover it on TV news, it's off-topic.",1210207261

Expose yourself to a broad range of things and hopefully this will lead to balance and perspective in life. Involve yourself in just one area too much and although it can lead to great things often it is at the social cost and danger of becoming too introverted. Just my $0.02. :)",1210207225

184042,comment,183535,183535,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"OK, so here's a problem.  Even if you do get someone from this site to help you, Ms. Django owns 35% of your company regardless.  Best case scenario, someone helps you, the product takes off, you have a big exit... you still have to pay her 35%.  That's a big problem.   The only way that you're going to get rid of her is to close the company and start over.<p>And, she's wasted 14 months of your time with precious little to show for it.  As far as I'm concerned if you work on a Django project for 14 months and have little to show for it, your developer is incompetent.<p>Start over.  Chalk it up to a lesson learned.  Pick up a couple of books and start learning how to code yourself.  That way, you'll know if your next co-founder is producing crap or not.  And, you just may be able to code something up yourself.<p>Pick up a prn job just to cover the bills.  I'm a nurse, I moved to Silicon Valley, and you can get a prn job out here that pays $75 an hour pretty easy.  We have people the commute from Dallas and Oregon to work here.  Fly in, work 6 days straight, make 5K and then fly back.  Consider it.  You'll also make contacts in Silicon Valley which is very valuable.",1210206742
184041,comment,183964,183964,0,0,DaniFong,,,"There's a bipolar rhythm of life and work that's easy to fall into, but it sounds like you need a break. There are very worthwhile projects that might take only 10 - 20 hours a week that, if you live simply, will be more than enough to get by. You can learn a lot from introspection in the remaining leisure time. Make sure you've got your necessities taken care of: shelter, learn to cook, get exercise, sunlight, make sure to hang out with friends or at least <i>someone</i> twice a week.<p>Sure enough you'll have the motivation to work on something again, maybe big, maybe small.

184040,comment,183964,183964,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's sorta an unfortunate fact of life that you can't have it all.  You have to make some tradeoffs.  (And I don't understand all the people saying ""You can have both.""  I've tried, and I couldn't - at least not while doing anything innovative.  You <i>can</i> have both if you're doing niche projects to serve a particular community, but I'd imagine many of the folks here are more change-the-world-or-die-trying types.)<p>Anyway, I think that in the long run it's about the people.  But I faced pretty much the same choice as you as a college senior.  I thought about it a lot and decided that when I was old and gray, I wouldn't be happy unless I'd at least tried and saw what I could do if I concentrated fully on hacking.  If it didn't amount to anything, then fine, at least I gave it an honest go and had a sense of my own limits.  But I'd much rather do that then always wonder what I <i>could've</i> done, maybe.<p>So I figure I'll keep this up until I'm 30.  If I succeed, great.  If I don't, I can have a normal, fulfilled life, surrounded by interesting people, and I'll have full knowledge of what I'm passing up.  The twenties are kinda a professional wasteland anyway, when nobody really knows who they are or what they want to do with their life.",1210206403
184039,comment,183846,183945,0,0,chriszf,,,"No offense taken, you make a fair point.<p>However, the reason everything has been about productivity is because that is the nature of computers, to automate tasks that would be tedious otherwise. This fact hasn't changed, but it seems like no one's addressing the simpler needs before tackling some crazy ""It's like facebook, but with movies"" startup.<p>For my address book example, there are always practical matters to consider. Privacy makes the 'social address book' a very tricky proposition. However, the 'address book with a nice interface' just hasn't really been nailed down (to my satisfaction, anyway). It would be hard to argue that such a thing isn't useful or desirable.<p>Just so there's no pussyfooting here, I'll clarify what my software does, so you can decide whether or not a social aspect is really necessary. It's a web tool that clones the functionality of 'Delicious Library'. It's basically personal inventory software for your media (games, books, movies, etc) and keeping track of who you loan your stuff to. While the capability to browse the libraries of your friends is a given, generalizing that to things like, 'see who else reads the same books' or 'form communities around specific authors' seems a bit of a stretch. Not that they're bad ideas (I wish I had the time to make them happen), but they're really a separate application.",1210206398

None of these, with the possible exception of no privacy (as in, the defaults provide no privacy), sound like they would stop you from putting it out there to see how it does and then improving as you go (outsourced, etc).<p>I have fallen into the trap of ""more development"" will solve this before. If you're selling a fire hose to someone on fire, they won't be too concerned with its color. Are you not releasing because there is no fire? Is that possibly why the developer did not see dollar signs and left? I ask you this not to be glib, but because I was on the other side of a similar, but much more amicable situation.",1210205947

Nearly all my friends are non-hackers, they laugh at me when i receive tweets and think I am crazy and raise eyebrows when I make some programming joke.<p>But you know what, underneath it all they kind of envy me because I have a palpable passion which many of them lack. They see that for me, life is not something you endure its something you enjoy. I have recently made more hacker friends and have great conversations with them...<p>But ultimately the people i get on best with are the entrepreneurial types. They can be selling lemonade on the road or trying to do the next big web thing, they dont have to be hackers and so i would suggest you broaden your pallet.

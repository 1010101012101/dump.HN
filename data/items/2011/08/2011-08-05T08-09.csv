2849442,comment,2849055,2849398,1,0,wheels,,,"<i>The only reason a person should be hired is because that person's abilities meet or exceed the requirements for the job.</i><p>That's actually somewhat less clear than it would seem on the surface.  It's a tenant of third wave feminism, which I generally subscribe to, and I think is approaching the correct behavior at present, but can't be considered outside of its historical context.<p>The reason that we have any semblance of gender parity is a consequence of more radical waves of feminism that came earlier.  The women's suffrage movement in the United States being a prime example of such.  When ending a regime of officially sanctioned discrimination, such as women's suffrage in the west (which only became universal in 1990, when the last canton of Switzerland allowed women to vote), or in post-apartheid regions such as the American South after the Jim Crow Laws were repealed or modern South Africa, there is utility in overcorrecting.<p>For example, I've typically supported affirmative action, since I believe that one of the precursors to minimizing racism in the United States (and South Africa, where a similar law exists) is the emergence of a strong black middle class.  Given that in much of the country there was an effective ban on such for the majority of the nation's history, turning the dials to actively promote such seems a reasonable measure.<p>Similarly, in countries where there was no strong women's liberation movement (e.g. Germany, where women's suffrage was a side effect of the constitution of the Weimar Republic around the time that women were given the vote in the United States), there's still a higher level of sexism that's tolerated in a professional environment.  Again, I draw the conclusion that the overcorrection of the suffragettes produced a more equitable environment that laid the groundwork for the modern third wave of feminism that is more gender-neutral than pro-women.<p>Since parity has still not been reached, it's reasonable to ask if liberal minded folk should come down on the side of actively bolstering women in positions of prestige or the growth of the black middle class and to what extent.  I don't think there's a right answer, and smart, progressive people come down on both sides as to whether or not we're ""there"" yet.",1312534619

2849428,comment,2842683,2843731,1,0,nitrogen,,,"It seems that you are conflating many separate issues, and using the red herring of Chinese counterfeiters to try to prove something in an unrelated discussion.  Long patents, obvious patents, patent trolls, long copyrights, strong copyrights, trademarks, etc. are all invoked in different ways by the examples given here in your and other comments, and a meaningful discussion can be had only when it is clear which aspect of the law is being discussed, and what segments of society the proposed changes will benefit.<p>Many of the commenters here on Hacker News are innovators in the sense that they are creating new software with new combinations of ideas that have not previously existed.  They are also against stronger IP protection, because to date, ""stronger IP"" has meant ridiculously long copyright terms, broad, non-novel, and painfully obvious patents, etc.  Many obvious patents cover things that are essential to the writing of software and have been previously documented by academics, but companies are still using them to demand a tax on the work of true innovators, large and small.  A sufficiently-skilled corporate lawyer can paint broad and obtusely-worded patents as covering anything they want in the minds of a lay jury.  Patent holders claim to have ""invented"" things that are considered by programmers as trivial, everyday tasks in their programming.  We are not ""stealing"" their ideas, as we never even hear they exist until a lawsuit comes out of the blue.<p>I could go on.  Such are the landmines facing small, independent and/or open source software creators, and they do nothing but slow down innovation and limit the growth our sector of the economy.  Alas, this thread has long since fallen off the front page, so it is probably best left to rest.",1312534090

2849424,story,,,12,18,dnc01,"Ask HN: Please help, can't expand fast enough",,"Hi<p>I have actually been on HN for over a year but wanted to create a new account so that these more private details of my company can't be tied to my actual business.<p>I am essentially a sole founder. My wife is excellent and runs a business as well yet we have kids so when 1 is working the other is not. While we both work into the night I say we would only accomplish the work load of a single person working full time on a startup with no kids.<p>After 3 months of development I finally launched my paid service, launched my free part of the product 3 months ago. (using a freemium model) and instantly started getting sales.<p>I have done no marketing other than to get at the top of a low searched keyword on Google (which I didnt actually try hard to get anyway) and this brings in around 20-30 users per day of which about 10% convert to premium within 7 days.<p>But with that I am only getting $20-$30 per day. ($9.95 once off payment) Yes this model only works for once off payments as they use the product for a set amount of time, then they may use it again later but it isn't a continuous payment model.<p>I also listed more advanced monthly options that aren't actually available yet, as I am still coding them, yet I have already received 3 requests on when will they be ready. So who knows how many more actually want it yet didnt bother to ask.<p>On top of that I need to work on upgrading to the cloud as I am currently getting anywhere from 3k - 8k page views a day with a steady increase and outputting about 2.5Gb per day in bandwidth.<p>The problem I am facing is as you can see the potential is great, its gaining traction, I have testimonials on how great the customer service and the product is compared to others out there.<p>I have ideas and stats that show I could push to the head of the industry if implemented. Yet I just need the time to code and market it.<p>I just don't have the resources to push out things fast enough, let alone even start marketing it. I have consulted with a lot of retail stores and other companies with their online advertising, conversions etc and I know exactly how to push this forward, again if I had the time to market. Yet if I brought on more users could I keep up with support questions and feature requests?<p>Just to let you in on my experience:
I am also coding this myself having worked 7 years from developer to lead architect previously. Then have been running various business / startups for the last 3 years.<p>I have done other startups in the past, obviously they didnt work out as hoped, unlike this one :)<p>How can I progress forward? So far the options I have thought of are below. Hoping for some new ideas.<p>1. Investors. Certainly open to the idea although wasn't originally but now I actually have a reason for investment (to fund growth) and not just keep me working to see if an idea pans out.<p>Initial problems with that are: I have never pitched before, do not know any investors specifically in tech and am based in Perth, Australia (so about as far away from the tech industry as I could get :) ) And while Perth is booming due to our mining sector in the state I do not know of any investors or if there are how to get in contact with them and if they are knowledgable enough to look at tech.<p>I don't just want the money, I would love experience and mentoring as well. I know they could give great general business advice but tech experience would certainly be an advantage.<p>2. Co-Founder. Again another idea that is worth looking at, but I am unsure how you would find the right person. They are tech conferences around but mainly for employees of the large mining sector. Not anything entreprenuerial (as I am aware of). I could look online overseas but again wouldnt know where (except on HN)<p>On top of that, any recommendations on how you would know they are a right fit? Or even how I would split considering I already have a business generating revenue.<p>3. I can easily get 1 week dev contracts to bring in about $5k and that could be used to hire a dev for a month.<p>The problem with this and why I am VERY hesistant towards it, is it seperates my focus from the product and I need to keep doing it until the startup generates enough revenue to hire them. I believe startups need 100% focus and this is just a distraction.<p>4. Just keep going. Looking like the option I am taking at the moment, is just to keep pushing forward and see how far I can get. I already work until 2-3am in the morning (which actually works out well as that is when the US is awake) and I don't watch tv. The reason I probably have kids I suppose :)<p>Over the last month I have been exercising more and eating better and it is giving me a boost in energy. Not enough to boost my productive by the amount needed though.<p>5. Bank loan - unlikely in my situation, I no longer have my cushy $150k yr job. Like I said, have been building startups for the last few years and I don't have the cash or income to justify it, especially in these times.<p>Any advice, other options appreciated. It is certainly on the brink and just need to push through the last stretch to profitability.",1312533990

This is doubly worrisome by the text that seems to suggest that ""zen"" (or, rather, Zen) and ""Buddhism"" are interchangeable concepts.  They're not.<p>Second, if you are a practitioner, you're undoubtedly aware of the large role that lists play in Buddhism-- which means that it's a bit deceptive to have a product named ""Buddhalists"" (or Buddalists-- see below) and not have the product based on the traditional Buddhist conception of lists.<p>Third: you don't even get the spelling straight on your own headline.

2849361,comment,2847675,2848532,1,0,alexholehouse,,,"So telomerase is slightly different - chromosomes have teleomeres at the end of each chromosome. These are just like long bits of ""this-is-the-end-of-the-chromosome"" DNA, like when you have a role of receipts and towards the end they have a red line through them to show the end is nigh.<p>You can think of it as like a ""count-down timers"". Every time a cell divides, the DNA gets doubled, so one cell doubles its DNA, creating two cells with identical DNA. When this happens, each of the telomeres in the new cell get a little bit shorter by a constant amount, and with this happening in a recursive way at some point they reach a critical length (Hayflick limit). At this point the cell knows it's undergone a certain number of divisions (~40 I think) meaning it's an old cell, so statistically it's likely to have picked up a few mutations. These mutations could make the cell less effective, or even worse, lead to some kind of disease (i.e. cancer), so as a precaution the cell initiates apoptosis. It's pretty clever - there may not be anything wrong, but there's a significant chance there is, the cell isn't perfect at detecting problems, so to avoid the risk to the rest of the body it kills itself.<p>Telomerase rebuilds telomeres, so is crucial in cells where lots of division is going on rapidly (such as embryonic cells) so cells can divide many more times by adding on the bit of teleomere that's lost. The problem is in cancer cells, telomerase is very often mutated into an always on position as it gives cells a way of being immortal. In normal cells telomerase isn't usually active, although it may have some other roles in pseduo-related areas. I was lucky enough to see Elizabeth Blackburn (Nobel prize winner for telomerase's discovery) speak a few years ago on this topic  it's really fascinating.<p>Proteins involved in DNA checking/repair are ones like ATM, Chk1, Chk2 , BRCA1, BRCA2, Rad51. There are many more, and they tend to work cooperativly together, though I can't remember the others off hand.<p>For more information regarding this kind of thing I'd really recommend Weinberg & Hanahan's The Hallmarks of Cancer [1]. Although published 11 years ago it's pretty much a classic, and gives a good overview of DNA damage and telomerase, albeit from a cancer viewpoint as opposed to generally.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/fedomany/Bioinfo05/lecture6_Hanahan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/fedomany/Bioinfo05/lecture6_H...</a>",1312531701

586314,comment,586224,586224,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I think one of the reasons that those people who prefer vinyl over digital do so, is that the recordings on vinyl are mastered with different qualities in mind than their digital counterparts. There's a YouTube video floating around called The Loudness War (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ</a>) that describes what I'm talking about.<p>I distinctly remember albums on audio CDs sounding better to me (great clarity, vibrancy, etc.) back in the early 1990s. Then, somewhere toward the end of the 1990s, CDs just started to sound worse. I blame the trend described in that video. I suspect that vinyl recordings do not suffer from this same tendency toward loudness in the audio mastering process, and that is why you have audiophiles insisting that vinyl sounds better than digital.",1241060274

No, lawyers aren't idiots, but there is a history of lawyers and judges making decisions that affect the tech industry and those within the tech industry while clearly not understanding the issues at hand.<p>> That seems like exactly who I'd want to issue a takedown notice to if I were Warner (...)<p>True, <i>if Warner knows they have a rock solid case and assuming they know who they were picking a fight with</i>.  On the other hand, to date Warner and their ilk have mostly sent out waves of takedown notices on generally unproven issues under the apparent assumption that they will receive little to no push-back.

586304,comment,586140,586282,0,0,barrybe,,,"It would be better, but I want to do some cool things that I'm not sure if I can support in an existing language.<p>One thing is automatically preserving state across a reload. This is really hard if I allow the programmer to store state any way that they want- I can't tell which things I should preserve. So the language forces the programmer to declare their stateful things in a special way.<p>Another thing is introspecting on code. I want to be able to click an image and then see all of the calculations that went in to that image's position (maybe so that I can change them). But this is pretty hard in most languages. Aliasing makes it hard. So this language discourages operations which are hard to introspect.<p>So I could theoretically support Ruby or something, but it would turn out to be ""not really Ruby"", because there would be a lot of stuff you wouldn't be allowed to do.",1241059776

I didn't ask him directly, though I joked about it in the usual detached office banter way, and I wouldn't expect he'd have got it diagnosed anyway.  It probably wasn't serious enough to go to a hospital.  But surely it <i>had</i> to be swine flu, right?  So I press 1.<p>I wouldn't do that, but I'm sure many people would.",1241059304

Often that phrase is associated with people who tend to use their relationships with others primarily as a way to benefit themselves alone.  Any benefit to the others in the relationship is strictly secondary, often unnecessary, and sometimes even just a tool for the person to further exploit the relationship to their benefit.<p>I don't think it is a coincidence that the phrase is very often applied to politicians.  In fact, I would venture to guess that politicians are the group this phrase is applied to the most often.<p>I'm not saying that everyone who ""works the room"" is a politician, and I'm not saying that all politicians are strictly self-serving individuals (yes, there are some good ones out there).  However, there are enough examples of politicians to whom the phrase is applied, that it is often associated with them.  There are also enough self-serving individuals to whom the phrase is applied that it helps to give the phrase a negative connotation.<p>And, obviously, there are quite a lot of individuals who have both the ""self-serving"" and ""politician"" categories covered.",1241056920

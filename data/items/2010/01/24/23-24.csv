1074009,comment,1072601,1073160,0,0,DenisM,,,"There are many explanations about real life vs online:<p>1. In RL you're a peer and assigning someone a rating you are attempting to establish your dominant position where none existed before. A web site is not a peer so the idea of ceding authority to it is less outrageous.<p>2. Website is a game. This induces an age regression - people feel like children who get scores assigned to them (their work) and get their worthiness judged based on those scores. To that end it helps to make things fun, easy, brightly colored, with large letters and not too much time commitment.<p>3. There is a ""suspension of disbelief"" going on there to help with #2 - like in a movie.<p>4. Web site has already assigned judgment to someone people perceive as their peers. Thus peer's acceptance of such judgment creates social proof of authority.<p>5. For some reason people discount opinion of a single, known peer after some time taking it as a given, and then seek validation from strangers.<p>6. Web site has an oracle-like property to it - it knows things about you. This goes deeper into horoscopes and stuff. You could pull it off yourself it you bothered to learn horoscoping techniques - basically telling people what they want to hear about themselves.",1264376356

In other words, what is your true goal?<p>You seem to want both a financially successful product, and one that is ""strong to stand on its own"". My spidey senses are telling me there is a lot of baggage in that latter quote - it looks like you want your contributions to the world to be not just financially successful but also noble in a way, or real-manly (the opposite of ""the easy way out""). These two are very different goals - one is of financial independence and the other one is of advancing up the Maslow's hierarchy to ""Esteem"" level.<p>There are several ways to go about it:<p>1) Give up on the money part and set about satisfying the Esteem need by getting a very esteemed job (which may not pay very well) - policeman, polar explorer that kind of thing.<p>2) Get the Maslow's urge under control via artificial means, and remain absolutely cold-blooded in business. When you make enough money the urge will let go of you, and even if not you will have means and training to attack a harder, worthier problem. The first business is not the end of life.<p>3) Keep building the business but surrender to the urge and let it control you. It will give you a lot of staying power, but it will also periodically send you on the wild goose chase (like writing your own high-scale online storage because real men only eat what they kill). It's a very round-about way about getting there.",1264375616

CTR mode uses the current logical block number as IV salt, so it's both random access and minimally-corrupting in the case of errors.

This is just not true -- and the WSJ should know that. You can generate leverage without borrowing a dime. Options contracts can be highly leveraged yet involve no borrowing. Futures contracts can be highly leveraged with no borrowed money.

There is no borrowing here but there's plenty of leverage.<p>Unfortunately a lot of the bad trades behind the meltdown (AIG derivatives, etc.) were basically private contracts, with no exchange mechanisms in place to mitigate counterparty risk.

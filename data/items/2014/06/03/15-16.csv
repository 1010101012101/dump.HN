They enable meta-programming, an invaluable tool to provide flexible yet efficient active libraries to users. They allow automated kernel-space exploration. So templates are exactly what you want.<p>I understand the need for a standard that supports various different architectures, even architectures that might not exist yet. I guess I just dislike the way the did it. Compared to other standards (that also leave various things to the implementer), I think they did a poor job. They should have defined the semantics and the types better. The entire buffer mapping for example is a huge mess. Nvidia went ahead and fitted pinned memory in there somewhere. Others didn&#x27;t, with the result that the meaning of the code changes completely depending on which library you link against.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing against OpenCL here, I&#x27;m saying they could do even better. It should not be too much effort too. And if companies like Apple and Google would have chimed in, we would have pretty awesome OpenCL standard and implementations today.<p>As for your argument about hand-optimization: C++ library implementers [0,1] (and compiler vendors probably too) found abstractions, tricks and tools that give performance portability today.

The problem is if there is any serious amount of depth to your app you need to overflow the access to the other features somehow and this is, in my opinion, a good way to do it.  I think that given enough time and it becomes a pretty common pattern the pain of discoverability that the article brings up will not be an issue.  Most of the arguments brought up in the article are only valid in apps with focused small sets of functionality. I think the move Google did with the Google+ app is a good(bad) example, they got rid of the hamburger menu in favor of a combination of several menus (bottom menu with a expanded menu at the top).

At one point, the OSCAR protocol would start doing things like requesting random binary chunks AOL&#x27;s official IM client to assert that a third-party wasn&#x27;t connecting to the service (i.e. working around this would mean distributing a copy of AOL&#x27;s IM client, which allows AOL to sue).",1401810354

They&#x27;re trying to get out of that niche, as the article clearly shows. (Let&#x27;s be clear here -- the article might be a PR fluff piece, but it hasn&#x27;t been written in an ignorance of the position of Cavium in networking). If they try to market this stuff for general purpose servers, they need to have an answer to the problem of parallelizing general purpose workloads. I don&#x27;t see why this is such an offensive thing to point out.<p>I work at a company making networking equipment (mainly for telecoms), targeting the 20Gbps range at the top end, with Xeons. We could scale much higher for trivial workloads like switching, but the bottleneck is in actual processing where the wimpy MIPS cores aren&#x27;t particularly tempting. The offerings of companies like Cavium have really not looked compelling compared to standard Xeons during the last 4 years or so.<p>Maybe if we&#x27;d started before that, we&#x27;d have started with a network processor and would naturally stick to it. But many of the more established telecom suppliers we&#x27;ve interacted with are likewise doing significant amounts of stuff with Xeons (standard hardware, or ATCA blades at the most exotic end). The only Cavium card I remember anyone using was doing 10Gbps of traffic that was so trivial, that even the low-spec 1U Xeon server the card was installed in could have handled it with the proper userspace NIC drivers.",1401810226

7840827,comment,7838450,7838450,4,0,todd8,,,"For years, I&#x27;ve been frustrated by the debate over the minimum wage. Like many economic arguments, lots of ideas are mixed together and argued without very clear analysis. Seattle will offer us an opportunity to see what really happens when we establish minimum wages at levels comparable to some other developed countries.<p>I happen to be a libertarian, and I note that there are often philosophical and economic arguments to be made for policy decisions. I&#x27;d like to see policies that are both just and economically efficient. So, for example, an argument (clearly specious) that women staying out of the workplace would produce overall economic gains doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  I don&#x27;t care if it would or it wouldn&#x27;t be more economically efficient for women (or minorities or red-heads) to be restricted from certain jobs.  It&#x27;s wrong to have laws restricting the freedom of women or minorities or red-heads and that trumps economic arguments.<p>In Seattle, they have decided that restrictions on their citizens fundamental freedoms, will on balance be worth instituting, but the freedom to work, entering into an agreement to sell one&#x27;s labor, is an important freedom that is being abrogated. What if Seattle decided that it wanted to encourage more high tech workers to move to Seattle, because it would increase the tax base, and they instituted a minimum wage for programmers, say $160 per hour. What would happen? Would you like being told that you were not allowed to program in Seattle unless you could find a job that paid $320,000 per year? It would ruin things.  Like $160 per hour programmers, many $16 per hour low-skilled teenage kids will be priced right out of the job market.<p>I got my start working in my first full-time job working for under $3 per hour. I lived at home with my parents, and my income made only a modest dent on the family&#x27;s overall income, but it gave me a start. I learned to get up every morning, get to work, and do my job. Low wage jobs are a way to get into the job market, even if they don&#x27;t immediately provide wealth and comfort.<p>Ignoring the restrictions on our freedom of contract, some argue that this development is a good thing nevertheless, that the $16 per hour will help those living in poverty. Well, if $16 per hour is a good thing why wouldn&#x27;t $25 per hour be even better? Clearly there is a level that will have negative impacts. Those supporting $16 per hour seem to recognize that there will be negative impacts, but the argument goes that these negative impacts are not so bad because they affect a group that the minimum wage supporters don&#x27;t like or don&#x27;t care about (for example, business owners).<p>Perhaps supporters of the new minimum wage really do care about everyone and my last paragraph is too harsh. In that case what I see is a kind of first-order effect rationale being given that ignores the indirect, but possibly quite significant, consequences of the new minimum wage policy. Each side in this debate has studies that they can cite, but money doesn&#x27;t grow on trees. It has to come from somewhere. Businesses will have to cover the costs by doing either (1) lowering the dividends to the owners/shareholders, (2) decreasing the salaries of higher paid employees or employing fewer people, or (3) increasing the costs imposed on the business&#x27;s consumers. All of these actions have negative consequences. (1), lowering the benefits of owning the business means that over time, there will be less of them in Seattle; (2), lowers employment, often of the people this policy is purported to help; and (3), increases costs to everyone (or lowers the quality of the goods provided).<p>If my simple breakdown in the previous paragraph is correct, why are politicians in Seattle supporting this new minimum wage? Politicians want to stay in office and they can use the minimum wage to appeal to large groups. One group is those that want to help others but don&#x27;t understand economics or freedom well enough to understand what this policy means. The other group is comprised of those whose jobs might be threatened by workers willing to do the same job for less than $16 per hour. (This is the reason that unions are big supporters of raising the minimum wage even though their workers have wages far above minimum wage. It protects their high wages from low cost competition.)",1401809868

There&#x27;s an interval implied by &quot;the&quot; time, and it&#x27;s quite possible that the difference here is in cultural expectations regarding the size of the interval or its placement relative to the stated time (US Military culture, for example, seems to have an implied tolerance of -5 min / +0 min).<p>It may even be the case that your hypothetical second party thinks the first is a bit quirky for insistently describing the meeting as occurring at a particular time, when it is &quot;obvious&quot; to them that what is meant is &quot;we&#x27;ll meet this afternoon&quot;.<p>Edit: moving scare quotes (&quot;the time&quot; -> &quot;the&quot; time)",1401809463

(The initial view shows Boston as the pole point)<p>> Furthermore, this map cuts of much, much closer to the poles than normal, allowing you to see many more orders of magnitude of distortion.<p>> Because this yields a map several times taller than it is wide, it is shown sideways from its usual orientation.<p>> The Mercator projection is infamous for its distortion at high latitudes. This distortion gets exponentially worse as you approach the poles. It is in fact impossible to show the poles on a Mercator map — they are infinitely far away.<p>> Any Mercator map you&#x27;ve ever seen must cut off the top and bottom edges at some arbitrary point. The map stops short hundreds, if not thousands of miles away from the poles.<p>> But I&#x27;ve often wondered what lies beyond those cut-offs... to make a map that didn&#x27;t cut off but simply kept going. As the distortion progresses towards infinity, you would eventually reach the scale of cities, houses, insects, atoms...<p>> But of course that&#x27;d all be on a featureless expanse of ice. No map service even publishes image tiles for such extreme latitudes.<p>> To make things actually interesting, we must artifically shift the pole of the project to a more interesting place. Imagine the earth encased by a rigid cage of latitude and longitude lines. We rotate the earth while leaving the cage fixed until a new point of interest has taken the place of the North Pole.<p>> This is called an oblique Mercator, and is normally used to shift an area of interest onto the equator of the map to avoid distortion. But whereas others avoid distortion, we embrace it.<p>> Note how strange the oblique Mercator looks even without the increased cutoffs. The standard Mercator is so ingrained in the public consciousness that we perceive it as &#x27;normal&#x27;. But once you shift the pole its ubiquitous distortion is laid bare.<p>> Lastly, increasing the cutoffs produces a map much taller than it is wide. So it is presented sideways here for easier viewing.

Enough so that I would bet money on it.<p>Swift is targeted at the largest user base of the Obj-C language, the iOS developers. Obj-C will be around for a long time both for legacy purposes and because Swift doesn&#x27;t interop with K&R C (unless that code has an Obj-C wrapper, like CoreFoundation), and C++ code. Since both Swift and Obj-C support using Cocoa libraries, any API added to Cocoa will be usable by both, but Cocoa is only one of many libraries in the Macintosh ecosystem.<p>Swift will become a replacement for the development the vast majority of people do, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that Obj-C is going away.

While it&#x27;s true that there is a fair amount of &quot;cut&quot; product and even fake product on the market the DEA&#x27;s own statistics do show that a large and growing percentage of seized &quot;ecstasy&quot; is testing pure, so statistically speaking you&#x27;re more likely to find pure MDMA on the black market today than at any time in the past.  With that said you do have to be careful.  There are ways to rule out the presence of certain contaminants such as methamphetamine, you might try purchasing a kit which provides certain chemicals that test for the presence of methamphetamine and other contaminants:<p><a href=""http://www.raveready.com/MDMA-Ecstasy-Testing-Kit-p/dansacc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raveready.com/MDMA-Ecstasy-Testing-Kit-p/dansacc....</a><p>(I&#x27;m not vouching for the above kit in particular, do your own research in this area)<p>If you feel like you need a third party to be there with you then maybe you do, each person is different.

Write the state as |y>=v|0> where v is some operator, then saying <y|y> is invariant is like saying v* v is invariant when  v -> v e^(-I* T(x,t)).<p>In physics, a term ~v* v would represent the potential energy of a spring. To represent the kinetic energy of a spring, we need a term like (d^{\\mu}v* )d_{\\mu}v where the d_{\\mu} represent derivatives w.r.t. space and time (\\mu is an index which runs from 0 to 3, 1,2,3 are x,y,z, 0 is time). Here, the U(1) transformation does not leave this term valid, because the derivative acts on the e^(-I T(x,t)) too...<p>However, if one were to make the replacement<p>d^{\\mu} -> d^{\\mu} - I e A^{\\mu}(x,t)<p>where when<p>v -> v e^(-I* T(x,t))<p>we have that<p>A^{\\mu} -> A^{\\mu} - d^{\\mu} T(x,t)<p>one can show (this doesn&#x27;t have to be obvious!) that then the Lagrangian<p>~(D^{\\mu}v)* D_{\\mu}v - v* v<p>(where D is the new &quot;covariant derivative&quot; we described above) is now invariant under local U(1) transformations.

That said, I&#x27;d echo what I&#x27;ve heard a number of people [1] say about this strategy... that your new challenge is making sure that people take enough time off and don&#x27;t feel guilty about it. This is the hidden <i>upside</i> to commoditizing PTO, no one sweats using it. It&#x27;s sort of perceived as a liquidized resource. In an environment without any rules or even vocabulary around time off, it can be a little bit discomforting to take a two week trip or go through with long-weekend plans in a crunch time, etc.<p>That said, I vastly prefer it to the alternative.. Just want to encourage teams that go down this road to not use these vacation policies as an accidental excuse not to pay attention to and discuss time off and whether it&#x27;s working out for everyone as well as you&#x27;d hope or expect!<p>[1] My first exposure to this sentiment: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Up-Organization-Corporation-Stifling-Strangling/dp/0787987751"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Up-Organization-Corporation-Stifling-S...</a><p>[Edit - Just feel the need to plug harder - Seriously, go read Townsend&#x27;s book.

Synchronization, locking, memory access patterns and context-switching from many threads with accompanied cache thrashing can bring the effective parallelization to very small levels.<p>I remember from benchmarking a high performance transactional messaging system in Java I was working on seeing how it hit a flat line at some point where it didn&#x27;t scale at all due to CPU/memory contention (this depended on maximal number of threads allowed). We had to look at alternative designs such as 0MQ to see how they overcame it - basically they put one working/client thread per core to achieve their 1M messages/s. We were using 10s of thousands of threads in our middleware when necessary, and that was faster than async NIO in Java 6 at that time.",1401807818

As though you have to work in order to earn the right to rest at home when you are sick or want to take a day off.<p>Unfortunately, there&#x27;s another side of the coin. I have worked alongside a couple of groups with a &quot;take whatever you need when you need it&quot; vacation/sick day policy. Either by choice or by necessity, they&#x27;re disgusting workaholics without exception who routinely grind for 10-12 hours a day, every day, for months, fearing the work that will accumulate if they are home sick for a day or away for vacation for any period of time. They don&#x27;t get paid more for working late. When I asked, they seem to each take one 5 day vacation once per year.<p>The saddest part of it all is their personal lives-- the wife of the boss of that group refuses to vacation to anywhere with any kind of internet access because she knows her husband will work instead of be mentally there with her. The other employees are single and friendless outside of work.<p>I&#x27;d very much prefer a more relaxed and less exploitative vacation/sick day system, but I think that a large cultural change has to happen in the US first. We don&#x27;t have the luxury of the philosophical position that work is an intrinsic good-- the real consequences of this position are pretty brutal, and evident everywhere. Once we accept that work is value-neutral, we can start to be more relaxed about how much we actually have to work, and when we actually work. And we might just be a bit more relaxed about staying home when we&#x27;re sick, provided that we understand our work is rarely more important than our health.",1401807734

Most of the foreign film footage of the massacre was\nshot in this sector of the city, in neighborhoods like Muxidi, Fuxingman and Liubukou, where hundreds of unarmed protesters and innocent bystanders were mowed down by random gunfire from semiautomatic weapons. The troops apparently made no distinction between these people and the small number who hurled stones, rocks and Molotov cocktails or set fire to vehicles that had been used as road-blocks.

4476252,comment,4474940,4475988,4,0,YokoZar,,,"I've heard from a Vegas lawyer that basically all of the serious law firms there do some amount of business with each of the casino chains.  This is intentional on the casinos part, and gives the law firms a very simple conflict of interest claim when someone wants to sue a casino.<p>Combine this with the fact that Nevada doesn't allow out of state lawyers (and passing the Nevada Bar requires a considerable investment in time), and as a consequence the only counsel you can get to sue a casino amounts to the sort of low-budget lawyer you might see advertising on a billboard.<p>If I had enough money and brass, I'd hire a bunch of promising attorneys from out of state, relocate them to vegas, get them certified in Nevada, and then create a firm specializing in suing casinos.  I'm sure there's a fortune to be made (if you don't get bought/killed by organized crime)",1346788763

Robots, being robots, are going to be <i>inherently safer</i> at the stuff you mention (tire failure, sudden obstacles, weather) simply because those things are ""dangerous"" <i>precisely because</i> they are unforseen and require the driver to take action quickly.  Robots are faster.<p>Road wear is a cost, but it scales at worst linearly with traffic.  I can't imagine anyone crying because we can now build ($$$$) half as many lanes of highways but much repave ($) them twice as often.<p>And the bridges things is just wrong.

Three main differences are<p>1) lots and lots of devops. You have to support dozens of  ruby, python, php versions. You have to support the version that Heroku uses, the one that EY uses, the one that AppFog uses. Same with databases. Then you have to somehow deal with the fact that gems that compile on Ubuntu 10.04 don't compile on Ubuntu 12.04<p>2) Then you have to make all of the above fast. We (I'm one of the founders of CircleCI <a href=""https://circleci.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://circleci.com</a>) spent months improving build speed, to make a compelling product. People don't pay for build results that take longer than their laptop can provide.<p>3) CI-aaS is high touch. A large percentage of new users will have lots of support in their first month. We don't track this stat yet, but Jason Cohen (founder of WPEngine) does, and his customers require 4x the support in their first month , compared to existing users.<p>3) Doing this well costs (and is worth) more than git hosting. It'd be a little strange for GitHub to buy a CI product, and then charge 2-10x for CI what they do for github.<p>4) GitHub has released multiple OSS CI products, and their employees have told me they don't think it makes sense to do hosted CI.<p>So I'm not holding my breath for an acquisition.

Will there be automated-only highways? Automated-only lanes? Is the beginning of the end for those of us who really enjoy driving (or motorcyles?). Or will those things just be limited to non-urban/track environments?<p>2)How does all this automation & closer car traveling @ high speeds work when natural events intercede. The most obvious one is weather (rain or snow), which can be a huge problem for cities as is, but it seems like having cars on the road with no ""bubbles"" of space to buffer great exacerbates the potential for massive accidents when there is marginal traction. Secondly, in many areas of the country, wildlife on highways is a very common occurrence (even in cities there's the occasional road debris/unexpected obstacle). I wonder how well an at-capacity automated highway could react to a sudden bit of road obstruction w/o running into a massive accident (or massive traffic jam) situation.<p>Of course, many/most human drivers don't handle adverse weather or unexpected obstacles very well either, so maybe these are just facts of driving, not arguments against automated cars as such.

Presumably road wear is less of a factor than jamming cars on the road, but I don't know that for sure and someone should do the math on that.  There is also a point where if you exceed a certain capacity percentage, anytime road work needs to be done it would dramatically impact traffic since there is less of buffer to absorb the lack of lanes.<p>3) As we increase capacity, we may run in to additional problems that we cannot imagine.

So if cars are moving along a highway already operating at capacity into a congested area, cars are arriving at the transition faster than they are leaving.  Thanks to the law of conservation of cars, excess cars must accumulate at that transition, and since they have nowhere to go, they wind up parked in a traffic jam.  And as long as the road feeding it is at capacity, that traffic jam grows.<p>From the point of view of the driver, this is what it looks like.  You're sailing along in smooth fast traffic, and then hit a sudden traffic jam with no warning.  After sitting there for a long time the road starts moving again, but goes much slower.<p>This is common experience in Los Angeles traffic.  And a significant fraction of accidents happen at that sudden transition from smooth sailing at 60 mph to a dead stop.

That may be unfair, but it's why scientists need a lot of training.<p>To take just one example, Graham mentions the Hughes Aircraft study, cited (by McConnell and others) in support of the usual ""exponential"" curve for defect cost (as ""Willis, Ron R., et al, 1998"").<p>When you <i>actually read</i> that paper - which is both one of the easiest to obtain and one that has the more detailed data about what was studied and how - and look for the raw data, you find numbers that do not obey an exponential law OR a monotonic increase. For one column for instance the numbers in fact vary within a narrow range .36 to 2.00 with two maxima at the ""Coding"" and ""Functional test"" phases, dropping off before, between and after. In a different column the costs vary only by a factor of two between Unit Test and System Test, by a factor of less than four between Code and System Test. The exponential rise is generally not true for the pre-1991 period; some post-1991 measurements get closer, but many do not.<p>It's hard for me to see this evidence as doing anything else but <i>undermining</i> the original claim of the exponential rise as a generally reliable regularity in software development.<p>Given this, I don't think that citing this paper in support of the claim is appropriate.",1346786265

That's a substantial savings when you're trying to fit into something like a 32KB L1 data cache.<p>Another technique that can help you fit as much useful data as possible into L1/L2 cache is to store offsets rather than raw pointers. Using a 2-byte unsigned short for an offset rather than an 8-byte pointer would save another 6 bytes of cache per entry, assuming you're happy limiting your URL size to 64 kilobytes. The extra address arithmetic should be essentially free on a modern pipeline.",1346785988

Years later, a group of researchers discovered that she had the starting signs of Alzheimer during this period. They did this by analyzing the range of vocabulary in her writings and there was a significant drop in the size of her vocabulary (15-30%) and an increase in the usage of indefinite words like something/anything. We can never be sure if she was aware of her slow deterioration, but something has pushed her to dwell on the subject of memory long enough. Even before we can consciously articulate the experiences of our brain, clues to our deep inner experience is scattered all over in the everyday choices we make, even in the choice of our thoughts. Look at the books that you bought, and the books that you ended up actually reading. You can apply the same to every bit of choice you make in your life, and you can put together a wonderfully detailed picture of your deep inner experience.<p>One particular corollary to this interrelation of pain and choice is our relationship to deficiency. Chuck Close drew pictures of human faces. His portraits are highly sought by museums and collectors. Chuck Close has a neurological condition known as face blindness. He cannot recognize human faces.<p>Rivers flow. The fertility from the resulting flow leads to formation of entire cities along its edges. The overwhelming focus that pain brings to particular deficiencies we face makes them the central structure around which we form our characters. I would not exactly say this is a bad thing necessarily, but it is a narrative that will help you explore yourself. It will take you to the far corners or more likely to the very foundation of your personality.<p>more here: <a href=""http://urbanravine.com/discovering-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://urbanravine.com/discovering-you/</a>",1346785716

The deck was not broken at all in this case, it was just in an unfavorable ordering to the house: an ordering that is still perfectly possible. Regardless of being very unlikely to happen, having the ordering these players dealt with over and over, it is still <i>possible</i>. Realize that if even one of the decks had been shuffled, then the players' strategy would have failed and they would have probably lost it all again. The players did not <i>know</i> all the decks would be unshuffled, they saw a pattern and took their chances. That is in fact the whole reason you play a luck based game -- for the off chance that luck falls in your favor.<p>It is enlightening that you cannot come up with the ""opposite"" scenario without actually breaking the game. Here allow me to come up with the opposite scenario for you: an ordering that does not favor the player, which by the way, happens basically EVERY HAND. That's why the house basically always wins, because these games are designed to have the odds against the player. By shuffling the cards the house is actually ensuring a higher likelihood of unfavorable outcomes.<p>That is what is so upsetting about these cases to me: the fundamental reasoning this all comes down to is that people are ""not supposed"" to win these games, thus winning must be cheating. If you design a game with the odds against the player, then spend tons of money outsourcing the randomization of cards to guarantee no card counting etc, and then encourage superstitious playing to keep people hooked and losing more money -- then on top of all this the player still wins, sue them?<p>Please.",1346785554

4475997,comment,4474724,4475487,1,0,dkarl,,,"Agile focuses on painful things with the goal of making them less painful.  The blog post compares embracing the pain of exercise to the Agile practice of taking big painful jobs, like merging and releasing, and streamlining them so you can do them more often in smaller increments.  The pain decreases because of automation, practice, and reduced change size.  Basically, the complexity of tackling change scales more than linearly with the size of change, so splitting a large change into smaller changes means less pain if the constant factor of handling each change can be made small.  From this perspective, Agile means tackling change in small chunks, and Agile practices are focused on reducing the constant factor.  The end result is less pain for the same amount of forward progress.<p>The reason I don't buy the analogy is because embracing the pain of exercising doesn't reduce the pain and doesn't have anything to do with the size or frequency of workouts.  It's entirely about perception.  You know the pain is there, but your experience of the pain changes.  It's like your brain learns the pattern <i>exertion => accomplishment => pleasure and satisfaction</i> and short-circuits the logic so that exertion is rewarded directly with pleasure and satisfaction.  Or maybe it's endorphins.  Whatever the explanation, pleasure is layered over the pain, but the pain remains underneath.  It's still there, but it doesn't hurt.  Or it hurts, but it feels good.  I don't know how to describe it, but the physical sensation of pain is still there.",1346785287

A hypothetical Steam Box or Valve-branded computer is extremely likely to be based off of COTS PC hardware, so there would not be a significant technical barrier to running games purchased on those platforms on a regular PC.<p>2. Steam already lets you buy a game once on Windows and play it on any Mac you own -- ie, they're not considered separate versions -- and Valve, at least, is extremely unlikely to stop developing for regular PCs, so you'd probably be easily able to load up any PC you have lying around with your Steam Box games in a worst case scenario.",1346785242

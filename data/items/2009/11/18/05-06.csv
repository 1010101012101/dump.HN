All you have to say is ""genetically modified"" and Europe flips its proverbial wig.  Aren't savvy English cattle farmers going to say ""Oh-my-Gaia this is Frankenfood!  It is unnatural!  It is <i>cloned</i>!  It probably has <i>DNA in it</i>!  Phone your representative, this should be banned!""<p>(The reference to savvy farmers is an oblique reference to the fact that the difference between GMO soybeans/corn/etc and non-GMO soybeans/corn/etc is that a preference or requirement for non-GMO product shuts American-grown stuff out of the market.  What a handy coincidence.)",1258523840

947867,comment,947254,947611,0,0,indigoviolet,,,"That's a very poor representation of bioinformatics. There's certainly a lot of data munging and cleaning (like in any field with lots of data), but bioinformatics/computational biology is not about dumb pattern matching or just writing code. Biologists can code just fine (I got a job at Facebook off a PhD in computational biology).<p>It's all about data mining and machine learning on biological data, to gain real insight about the functioning of an organism, often then doing the experiments to test that insight. I've seen lots of computer scientists and programmers jump in and flounder, because they're under the misconception that all it takes is the application of canned algorithms to a new data set. You need to understand biology (genomics, molecular biology, genetics, structural biology), first and foremost. Then you need to understand a significant amount of statistics, information theory, and computer science.<p>This isn't meant to discourage you, but you're not going to get far beyond doing more web programming for biology websites if you don't teach yourself some of these areas.",1258523670

947860,comment,947417,947634,0,0,agent86,,,"And I think the article takes a bit of a wide berth with the term ""designer"".  Steve Ritchie actually designed those machines, Larry DeMar did the software for them.<p>As other posters have pointed out, innovation really did not stop in 1992.  Pinball 2000 was actually a success, but Williams decided to pull the plug despite that.  The Pinball 2000 platform was quite revolutionary - from how the player played the game, to how the game was designed, maintained, and even upgraded.<p>I don't think free play really had anything but an ancillary role in the decline of the hobby.  It was likely the rise of video games, and specifically home consoles, that really hurt pinball.  People played video games at home, and then played newer/better games in the arcade.  Due to the cost a pinball machine in the home is a rarity to this day, and so the exposure it received was never the same.  Kids learned Mario and Nintendo, they didn't learn the silver ball and flippers.<p>Along the lines of the article, the most ""interesting"" idea I heard in pinball circles was that clear coating playfields was a harbinger of doom.  Williams started doing this and called it ""Diamond Plate"".  It was designed to reduce the need for mylar to protect the playfield.<p>The premise is that the idea worked TOO well.  Playfields on the machines could look like new forever.  A machine's lifetime was extended, the impetus to replace the machine was lowered, and sales suffered.",1258523373

(Yet.)<p>You raise an interesting point. At a guess, I imagine if you asked a big game hunter or combat soldier with experience tracking a target and firing weapons with the intent to kill, they would probably notice the disconnect. I wonder if Guitar Hero has limited fans among those who can actually play the guitar, for this reason as well?",1258523316
947856,comment,947581,947581,0,0,jhlb,,,"My introduction to the way that businesses work was an ""Engineering Economics"" course. It is about how accounting works, i.e. ""financial accounting"" vs. ""management accounting"", the time value of money, what the numbers on a quarterly report mean, &c. If you find a course syllabus online you can see what topics are covered, and a find textbook.<p>Also when I was seeking this type of knowledge, I read chapters 2,3,4 of <a href=""http://pmbook.ce.cmu.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pmbook.ce.cmu.edu/</a> , which I found by looking at a MIT opencourseware course on project management.

I find that operating at n-1 developers forces a team to really consider what the most important features are.  As a developer, it's really easy for me to start thinking of really cool features, and if only I had another programmer or two on my team, I could do those features.  But those are usually the superfluous features.<p>Joel Spolsky makes the same point in one of his posts on Joel on Software, although he uses a schedule as the limiting factor instead of number of programmers.

947833,comment,947417,947517,0,0,jerf,,,"Dynamic difficulty is a terrible idea. It reduces the potential difficulty-space of the game to two basic cases: Always too easy and always too hard. It means that if you lost, it's because the game chose to make you lose, not because of an effect on your choices, and if you win, it's because the game chose to let you win, not because of your skill.<p>Every couple of years I'll play a game with this new, innovative idea, and it's still the same story. It's sort of fun for a bit, until your brain catches up and realizes that as meaningless as most games are, this one is even more so.

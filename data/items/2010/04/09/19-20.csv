1253688,comment,1253490,1253490,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, there are a couple things here that jump to my mind.<p>1. Adobe isn't completely innocent.  They're pretty close to a monopoly on their type of software and charge dearly for it (their Creative Suite costs as much as a MacBook Pro).  They've done a lot to make sure there are no non-Adobe Flash players even when that's just hurting customers and not costing them money since they don't sell the player.  They're not exactly ""open"" and ""free"".<p>2. Apple could be said to have an interest in not supporting intermediaries.  Intermediaries are likely to create less efficient code and I'm sure they don't want to deal with developers using up their support time over things that are the fault of Adobe's Flash SDK or Novell's C# one.<p>3. It's also in Apple's interest to get people using Objective-C and their toolkit.  It brings developers to the Mac by forcing them to buy one.  That will have positive externalities in more software for the Mac.  It gets developers into the Obj-C camp which means more people with Mac development skills. It means that apps can't be re-compiled for iPhone, Android, and webOS - and that's huge for customer lock-in.  We all know how users get attached to their apps and I think it's easy to imagine Adobe building an Android compiler right after the iPhone one got finished.<p>Do I like Apple's stance?  No.  As a user and a developer, it's bad for me.  However, Apple's the market leader and getting people to use their API gives them control and means that app developers will always be ready to use the latest new features they add while building a wall of incompatibility against Android and webOS that will keep users buying iPhones for apps in the way that users bought Windows computers for their apps for ages.<p>Jobs wanted web apps. Developers balked.  Web apps would have been cross-platform (at least with Android and webOS).  Apple responded to developers and now they've seen their chance to lock users and developers to their system.<p>Adobe isn't known for being open.  Given the chance, Adobe seems to wall itself off as much as Apple.  Companies tend to go for openness insofar as it's in their interests.",1270842968

Apple has no way to know that you have done the latter instead of the former - but they still have made this a reason to kick you out of the store. More importantly they have killed any tool that does the latter. This is not about closed walls and consoles. This would be like Sony telling Playstation developers they must type in Dvorak.

If the employer has foresight, then the developer is at a disadvantage in this early stage of the relationship because it allows the employer to put out a ridiculous sounding job requirement yet still get a decent developer by playing the numbers game (interview lots of devs; hire one temporarily and fire them if they're no good.. then hire another etc...).<p>With that in mind, lets look at the points:\n#1) We need some guy who should probably know all these things because we use them all.. somewhere.. in our organization. The more they know all these thing, the more useful they'll be to us from day 1.<p>#2) We need someone who has a pair. Either from experience or sheer will. Come in and show us that you're the one we need. If the big numbers scare you, then you're probably not our guy anyway. We also use a few old technologies that have served us very well - it would be fantastic if you already know them.<p>#3) You're not a unique or a beautiful little snowflake. You'll find out how we work when you get here. If you can't adapt, you'll leave - probably against your will.<p>#4) The last guy who did this job was awesome. He worked hard to help us become who we are now. We expect no less of you.<p>#5) We do things a certain way and it seems to be working for us. We expect you to respect that, considering we don't even know you yet. You'll have plenty of opportunity to help make this a more welcoming place if a) we hire you, and b) you don't forget all these pain points once you come on board, and are motivated to do more than just your job description.<p>Jobs are like girlfriends (or boyfriends) are like most relationships. They may or may not start out smoothly. You'll find out that they're single (existence of job ad), kinda cute ($, benefits), and maybe, but they might only be nice to their friends and a firewall to everyone else (job description / initial response etc..).

By definition those calls are also statically dispatched.  invokespecial is to statically-dispatch a call to a virtual method, and is used both for constructor invocation (the construct is implicitly a method named ""<init>"") and also any time you call super.foo(), since you're explicitly specifying the target method and wouldn't want that call to dynamically dispatch back down to your subclass.  invokevirtual and invokeinterface both dynamically dispatch instance method invocations; invokevirtual is used for method calls to a concrete type while invokeinterface is used for calls to interface methods.  The primary difference is performance-related:  invokevirtual can be more heavily optimized because it's a call to a known class or one of its subclasses, so the VM can do things like store the vtable offset for the method.  invokeinterface is invoking the method on some unknown object every time, so it has to be looked up each time (though technically if it's always the same implementation, in practice invokeinterface should be about as fast, since you'll just end up with a guard clause and then a direct invocation of the actual target method).  For purposes of a method handle invocation, I'd imagine that invokevirtual and invokeinterface should behave the same, i.e. they just dynamically dispatch.<p>Currently the Method object in Java always does dynamic dispatch for instance methods and static invocation for static methods, and there's no way to do mimic invokespecial via it.",1270841315

Turns out you need passion for the topic, however, to do it right ;-) Dan had that more than I did. The funny part is now <i>I'm</i> the one more optimistic about the iPhone/iPad platform :-))",1270839653

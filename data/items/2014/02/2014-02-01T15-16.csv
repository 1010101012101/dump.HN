Its not as fast as Java because afterall Java is static typed. However there is a way to get even faster than JAVA code.<p>Pharo comes with a library named &quot;Nativeboost&quot;. Nativeboost is essentially an inline assembler. But unlike C/C++&#x27;s inline assembler of using assembly syntax, the inline assembler of Nativeboost uses Pharo syntax as each assembly command is a Pharo object like everything inside Pharo. Also because VM will stop all execution when it executes assembly code, you can enjoy raw machine code speed. Thus you can have Pharo code that can outperform Java code. If Assembly is not your thing , Nativeboost can be used also as a FFI to call C dynamic libraries. Currently C++ is not support because of name mangling but its possible to compile a C++ library as C library to be used by Pharo. Also Nativeboost&#x27;s FFI offers support for Objective C as well.<p>There are also two projects to run smalltalk on Java, one is called redline smalltalk, the other&#x27;s name eludes me now. There is also another project to bring Smalltalk to Java including even the Smalltalk IDE called &quot;RTalk&quot;. But that project seems to be vaporware for now.",1391269730

But, also, most of the reporting is around a &quot;duty to disclose inventions&quot; clause, and none indicates anything about work for hire in copyright -- its not at all clear from anything I can find on the case that it addresses scope of employment/work for hire issues, just scope of an enforceable contract clause which may effect a transfer of ownership.<p>So none of these cases seem to be on point here.",1391268934

In case you are not aware live coding simple means to code an application while the applications runs. With other languages making mistakes is quite costly. With Pharo (and Squeak) if you make such a mistake the debugger will pop up and ask you politely :D to correct your mistake after that it wont punish you by restarting your app but rather allow you to resume where you were. Whats impressive is that this allow you to code entirely inside debugger and even introduce mistakes on purpose to see overall how your app is behaving. There are no files to compile, compilation takes place per method.<p>Another thing I like about Pharo is the distribution process. I have been burned by Python and really sucky distribution libraries and very buggy py2app and py2exe. If you want to distribute a pharo app, thats is very simple and require zero packaging. Pharo does not install in your OS, its a simple folder containing an executable that loads image files. Those image files is memory dumps of byte code which contain all you need to run the app. So all you have to do is zip the folder and share away. You also do not need specialized tools to run multiple versions and/or instance of Pharo. Just put Pharo in diffirent folders and voila. Also now PharoLauncher allows you with easy to download custom images and manage your existing ones with ease. PharoLauncher is again a Pharo folder containing an image containing the PharoLauncher tool and library :)<p>The IDE is also very , very nice. Again when I was coding in Python I was not happy with the IDE. The Pharo IDE is written in Pharo its easy to use once you figure out the main functionality and quite well documented. Most importanly the IDE is tailor made for Pharo instead of general purpose nonsense that will offer substandard support for your language of choice. I like the fact that it wont allow you that easily to make mistakes and that it comes with so many tools to make your life easier. Its the best IDE I have use so far.<p>Lastly I really love the community , they are very friendly with Begineers and newcomers and they really deeply care about Pharo. Its quite actively developed, bug get fixed and there is always new features coming in. There is also Amber , Pharo brother, that compiles to Javascript and can use any Javascript library.<p>I can go on and on and on, but thats the most important things for me. The rest you can discover by yourself, all I can tell you is that there is a lot more. Foremost coding in Pharo is a lot of fun and very productive.",1391268776

We are now looking for a business co-founder and leader to unlock this potential.<p>We’re looking for someone who knows the relevant entertainment markets (including both traditional at-home game consoles and the out-of-home entertainment market); is skilled at business and strategic planning; has experience getting integrated hardware/software products to wide distribution; can get us the right industry partners; can lead fundraising as needed; has executive management potential; and is generally a excellent person who is fun and inspiring to work with.<p>Our game table is being featured this month at IndieCade East, the annual independent games festival, at New York’s Museum of the Moving Image. We think it’s both gorgeous and ergonomically unique, comfortably sitting up to 6 players with plenty of leg room. (Design has been led by a leading contemporary architecture firm headed by MIT/Harvard architecture professors.) Technically, it’s a smart combination of open-source and proprietary software, including our own game framework built on Unity3D. (The core table engineering was led by an MIT Media Lab expert in multi-touch tables.) Unlikes many interactive tables, it’s cool to the touch and is seamless and spill-proof; having a cocktail or beer at the table is encouraged by design. We already have around a dozen games working on the table -- from alpha to polished, some our own, some from third-parties indie game developers.<p>In short, we think we’ve created a special product that enables a unique and wonderful face-to-face game experience -- bringing the best of digital technology into a fully present, truly social interaction. Now we’re looking for a co-founder to turn an exceptional product into an exceptional business.<p>Additional background: the founder and creative director of Grasshopper NYC is an MIT engineer with a track record of product and business innovation in new media, including high-level executive positions in business news and as as a product management director at Google. A blog post in Gamasutra, a leading games industry website, noted that Grasshopper NYC is being talked about as “the coolest thing happening in the New York game industry at the moment.”<p>Interested?

And like the best sort of propaganda has enough kernels of truth to be dangerous.<p>China&#x27;s military is optimized for maintaining internal stability and national unity. A civil war is the worst case scenario for China&#x27;s leadership. You don&#x27;t need a deep water navy, or a massive air force to achieve this goal. You need a massive tier-2 riot police force with some heavy hardware to augment when things really get out of control.<p>Along with almost no practical combat experience beyond internal stability operations, the PLA is simply not optimized for engagements outside of the national borders. There&#x27;s pitifully few deployable logistics units.<p>However, on the few times China has chosen to mobilize against neighbors, the PLA has shown an ability to move truly unbelievable number of soldiers moderate distances away from the border.<p>There&#x27;s also some debate if the PLA acquitted themselves better during the Korean War than during the later Sino-Vietnamese war. I think there&#x27;s something to that, the end of the Chinese Civil War wasn&#x27;t all that long before that, and it&#x27;s likely that veterans of that conflict were in field command positions during the Korean War, but were not in the Sino-Vietnamese war. The outcome of the Sino-Indian war (1962) also probably falls at the career end of the same veteran commanders. In fact, China was at it&#x27;s most muscular directly following the end of the Civil war (Tibet, Korea, India all between 1950 and 1962). The Soviet border conflict and the Sino-Vietnamese war, which were almost a decade later were not great victories for the PLA.<p>If that trend is true, the modern non-combat honed PLA may be lacking in critical modern battlefield experience. But it doesn&#x27;t take a terribly long time for a military to gain that experience and capture it for a few years. Any conflict with the PLA, even if it started poorly for the PLA, would likely turn around not long after.<p>A friend of mine says that China is historically does not psychologically act in an outwardly facing expansionist way. It simply looks inward to admire itself, and sometimes to get a better view of the Middle Kingdom, steps backwards a few steps into somebody else&#x27;s territory.<p>What remains to be seen, is if China&#x27;s new economic policy creates a golden period of internal stability, if that gives military planners more time to regear and reoptimize the PLA for external conflicts rather than internal peace keeping. Right now, it&#x27;s too distracted by domestic issues to really do this whole heartedly. But with a massive industrial capacity, I would predict that if such a shift were to occur, the world would be blindsided with how quickly that shift would happen.",1391267332

It should be noted that no matter how much evidence you can provide to your payment company about legitimate chargebacks, it&#x27;s all useless if any one of the following is true:<p>(A) the person/s fighting the chargeback for you are incompetent / don&#x27;t care / don&#x27;t actually file the chargeback; \n(B) the person/s fighting the chargeback for you are <i>bullied</i> into minimizing or hiding or not reporting evidence that can prove things like recurring fraud, identity theft, or bogus accounts; ultimately, this evidence exposes weaknesses in the payment company&#x27;s systems that the payments company doesn&#x27;t want &quot;out there&quot;;\n(C) the company is just plain unethical and will actually go out of its way to get rid of employees who <i>do care</i> and are willing to spend time and resources fighting chargebacks at an individual level -- such companies do this because they value company &quot;image&quot; in the eyes of investors / VCs > &quot;the little guys&quot;.<p>As the person who filed and fought -- with a decent success rate -- almost 100 percent of the chargebacks for <i>competitorofStripe</i> but who was let go for reasons (B) and (C) above, I would gladly testify that this is a real problem that cannot be solved without employees who know right from wrong.  A little over a week ago I wrote to Patrick after reading another thread criticizing Stripe&#x27;s customer support and turnaround.<p>Clearly Stripe needs help in this area.<p>Ultimately, payments companies need technical people who care, but it&#x27;s a weird combination, and those people are few and far between.  Those people need to be allowed to make their own decisions and spend time on individual cases, even when the cost:benefit math tells the managers or CEOs it&#x27;s not &quot;worth it&quot;.  I&#x27;m recently coming off a year of independent projects, and would like to get back into the team environment.  It really doesn&#x27;t make sense for experience and specialization to go to waste.

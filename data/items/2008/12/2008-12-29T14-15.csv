413035,comment,412785,412896,0,0,bjelkeman-again,,,"How do you do an objective evaluation of a plumbers work? Most plumbing work that needs to be done is pretty small.  I call the guy. Talk to him, if I like the attitude he gets to do a job. If he is good he gets a second bigger job. Evaluating based on references would only work for me if I had a big job to get done. But for small jobs, the $50 voucher and a small job from the guy who came and said ""hi"" would pass my first test. He would get the small job, that leads to bigger jobs.",1230562561

Very interesting discussion, just let me add two little pieces of information that might be useful to the people who would like to inquire further:<p>One of the first if not the first to propose  quantum mechanical processes related to consciousness was 
Evan Harris Walker his book ""The physics of consciousness"" 
(Basic Books, 2000) which makes a very interesting reading.<p>The latest on this, as far as I know, can be found in the book ""Quantum Aspects of Life"" (Word Scientific, 2008)<p>Happy New Year!",1230562486

Todd predicted the collapse of USSR (when it was a minority position among intellectuals), and it has been several years he is ""predicting"" the collapse of the U.S (way before the current crisis). His main prediction is the collapse of the U.S dollar.<p>A very important thing to note is that he believes the U.S is gone as the sole superpower. What he really means by collapse is about the same fate that endured the British Empire.",1230561328

413018,comment,410930,411611,0,0,mistermann,,,"You're jumping to a conclusion.  I think its fair to say that the the point the anti-""we are all equal"" camp is trying to make is that men have higer representation on the ends of the bell curve.  People at both ends (the truly brilliant and truly unable) of the bell curve are largely skewed towards men.  Not entirely, but highly disproportionately.  This is a perfectly viable explanation for the lack of female leaders in most any field.  And freedom of academic choice and opportunities for several decades now, at least in the west, hasn't seemed to change the result, which would seem to reinforce this theory, whereas it would seem to discount the environment argument, in my opinion.<p>I don't think any of us have asserted that women can't be brilliant and compete head to head with men, but if you are looking at any field of expertise, with equal numbers of male and female participants, the top one to five percent of people will almost always be disproportionately men, consistently across fields, over time, and it seems to continue despite changing social and cultural norms.<p>I think the comment above calls into question the merit of your friends achievement, which will always be the result of affirmative action programs.  It is well documented that affirmative action often (but not always) results in lesser skilled candidates from preferred disadvantaged classes (race, gender, etc) earning admission or appointments.",1230560831

Consulting is a pretty vast world; you can be a glorified contractor or you can go help companies actually solve some of their deep problems. If you have a good customer-base, you can be up to your ears in interesting work and get paid incredibly well for it.<p>The downside is that you're a bit of a ronin, and you have to be ruthless with the customers you keep as well as the new customers you bring on.<p>I don't think I have the energy to do it full time any more, because it is incredibly time consuming; but I am definitely glad I did it for as long as I did.",1230560606

While I was there I was a heavy metal radio host for WKNC, and received a <i>lot</i> of letters from death row inmates.<p>Very few letters were of the type I was expecting at the time: &quot;Play this Cradle of Filth song for me, or I will file down shards of my broken mirror in order to kill you&quot;. Along with very entertaining, if graphic, pieces of artwork.<p>Most of the letters were cordial, but gruff. Hard criticism of songs each inmate did not like, glorified praise for the songs they did like. Rarely, they would describe why a particular song was important to them and it was not anything alien to my freshman self: lost love, old buddies, family, trying times.<p>There was one I replied to and carried on a brief written correspondence with: Tilmon Golphin. Make no mistake, there is no excuse for his actions. But what I found fascinating was the attitude he decided to show in his letters; how true his words were I cannot accurately judge. He showed me major regret of brutally murdering officers of the law and provided no excuses, instead showing acceptance of what he had done with his brother.<p>I later learned that particular case of his and his brother&#x27;s is one where the US Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in <i>Roper v. Simmons</i> divided the sentences of the brothers. Tilmon was 19, and his brother 17, so while both were sentenced to death, the SCOTUS ruling means Tilmon is still on death row while his brother is not.<p>I never would have thought I would learn so much from being a heavy metal radio show host.",1443498345

Actually, most Rust projects end up using Freetype for glyph rendering, which does support subpixel rendering.<p>Signed distance fields are great for animated text, but they also have a couple of disadvantages - they generally produce lower quality output than Freetype at small glyph sizes, and the signed distance field is more complex to generate at start, which slows down initial page rendering.

So, because the system is not perfect, we should remove death penalty altogether? Is that seriously the point PG is making here?<p>IRL there is no perfect system whatsoever. Yet we learn how to live with risk and deficiencies and hopefully improve things as we move forward to make less mistakes. Whether that applies to the US Judicial system, I don&#x27;t know, but that&#x27;s not a good reason to remove the death row altogether. There are a number of criminals who are well known to have no empathy and can kill without remorse or emotion, and I don&#x27;t see how this kind of individuals can be rehabilitated in any way within society. On top of that, every individual who is conscious about their actions should also face responsibility - that&#x27;s part of the &quot;social contract&quot; on which we base our actions every single day.

TDPlus, which runs in DOS, is intended for the real-time monitoring of telemetry data. We had lunch-box style computers with the old-style 51 pin parallel port for &quot;high speed&quot; data (up to 10 Megabits/sec) interfacing with experimenter equipment, as well as GDP Space Systems bitsync/decom cards.<p>The lunchbox computers were always breaking down. Floppies were subject to all the faults you mention and were always failing. I found a hoard of floppies in an old cabinet and spent a day or so seeing which ones I could still use, and then protected them like gold.<p>All of this was still used because management claimed that &quot;the right color of money doesn&#x27;t exist for us to upgrade this&quot;. They had started to get a few newer units when I left...but depending on such horribly unreliable units for critical launch functions still boggles my mind.

I suspect that it&#x27;s already large enough that adding LLVM to the mix isn&#x27;t terribly meaningful. Especially once you assume that all this stuff is sandboxed anyway.<p>> <i>Anyone that debugs an issue in their shipped code.</i><p>You&#x27;re going to have to do better than that. Speaking as someone who&#x27;s been developing iOS apps since the moment the app store opened, and who knows a <i>lot</i> of other iOS developers, I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> heard of anyone downloading an un-DRM&#x27;d version of their app store app for debugging purposes. The closest I&#x27;ve come to that is verifying what entitlements file the App Store version was built with (but this was done with iTunes Connect, not actually downloading the ipa).<p>The only benefit that you can get from downloading the binary is inspecting the assembly, which itself is only useful if you&#x27;re hitting an optimizer bug, but even then, you&#x27;d actually want to work with a non-app-store build because you can&#x27;t debug app store builds. So you won&#x27;t actually be downloading the app store binary anyway, you&#x27;d just use the existing archive you uploaded to begin with, or even build a new one from the source.<p>Which means that, given all that, the only case here where you&#x27;d have a legitimate reason to want to download the app store version is if Apple manages to introduce an optimizer bug when recompiling your bitcode that you can&#x27;t reproduce yourself. Not only is this likely to be extremely rare to get such a bug, you should still be able to reproduce it yourself if it happens because any new optimizations should be made available in the latest Xcode.<p>> <i>Anyone doing security research.</i><p>Irrelevant to the topic. The case here was a developer verifying their own product. Bitcode changes absolutely nothing with regards to people downloading other developers&#x27; apps.<p>> <i>Any users investigating their own system.</i><p>See previous paragraph.",1443496001

That&#x27;s one major reason why the numbers should be taken with a grain of salt.<p>Servo uses the same painting backend as Firefox does: Moz2D (also known as Azure). Moz2D is itself an abstraction layer over Cairo, Skia, Core Graphics, and Direct2D. So comparing against current Servo is actually a good way to compare against Firefox and Chrome in CPU painting mode: it&#x27;s using the same painting backend as both of those browsers and eliminates any noise that results from layout differences.<p>The most important thing to note is that the overall approach is quite different from Skia-GL (Ganesh). Skia is largely an immediate mode API (with a few retained-mode-style optimizations available with SkPictures, but the overall approach is immediate). WebRender (preliminary name), however, is a fully retained mode API and has no immediate mode at all, allowing it to focus on aggressive optimizations like &quot;strength-reducing&quot; clipping regions and Z-buffering opaque content for improved batching. This is a tradeoff, and it&#x27;d be easy to construct pathological cases in which one API or the other performs better. What we need to find out is which wins on real-world content, and while our early results are promising (and intuitively it seems highly probable that a retained mode API will win for CSS and the DOM), there&#x27;s a lot more investigation that needs to happen before it&#x27;ll be a slam-dunk case.",1443495918

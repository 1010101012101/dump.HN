Therefore some startup should create an internet scale distance-vector routing protocol.  OSPF is dead, long live RIPv4 or whatever.  Cisco would be an obvious candidate to purchase the startup.  Obviously demand would depend on FTL deployment rates.<p>I&#x27;m only half kidding, I think...",1374530385

The NY Times was not only complicit in the Iraq war, but came out strongly against Julian Assange through a series of horrible articles.<p>The purpose of the NY Times is to serve powerful interests and to prevent the embarrassment of powerful people.<p>Just skimming many of the regular op-ed contributors and editorial writing gives a window into the mentality of the paper.

However, will that translate into useable and effective computing software? From my point of view, I have not really seen a single application on Leap which does something &#x27;better&#x27; than a touch based or mouse-based interface can do. Better meaning more intuitively and/or more productively<p>3. I think one of the biggest challenges for any gesture controlled device is the shoulder/forearm/wrist/palm pain that is inherently going to be the result of prolonged gesture-driven interface use. Maybe applications have to use gestures sparingly?<p>On a broader note, I still think humans have an inherent desire to touch/feel interface elements. Being able to directly touch a screen and manipulate it means I can easily manipulate visual behavior through an actual/physical connection. Interfaces which disconnect this physical medium seem more alien to me at least. Maybe I am less evolved as a neanderthal but I don&#x27;t think we are ready for a gesture driven interface.",1374529757

There&#x27;s not much new in the article, lets cook up something really new here.<p>First of all FTL travel involving information transfer would have some interesting implications for the existing automated market high freq trading systems.  Your proximity to the central clearing house no longer limits your profits.  In fact the whole concept of HFT and a central clearing house and &quot;A&quot; individual market price might no longer have much meaning in that kind of economy.  And that might be good, or bad, or not matter much.<p>Another aspect given ridiculous paranoid military industrial complex would be anything capable in theory of eventually delivering an a-bomb would be classified and hidden until an area defense exists.  In fact a rational participant in MAD would immediately nuke any MAD member who got &quot;close&quot; to inventing actual FTL because they would insta-win any MAD scenario, therefore bomb them before they FTL bomb us.  Aside from any direct weaponization of FTL &quot;things&quot; materializing in .mil owned reactor cores or .mil strategic targets.  Shields materializing at FTL speeds in front of the laser beam headed toward the target.  FTL drones to spy on people so quickly they&#x27;re out of range before the target sees they were there.  Yeah I think the first country to develop FTL will probably get nuked by everyone else, unless the discoverer is legendarily neutral (the swiss?) or ...  Which would suck if the USA &quot;wins&quot; because it means I&#x27;d be getting toasty unless every other nation is suicidal and refuses to strike.  Bummer for me and the rest of the usa.  So I sincerely hope this dude fails.<p>Another interesting aspect vaguely hinted at in Ian Banks culture series is a FTL-ish universe culture by its very geography/technology inherently ends up much more libertarian than our own rapid descent into &quot;1984&quot;.  So there&#x27;s interesting political issues where any group of modern &quot;pilgrims&quot; can at will escape the clutches of the evil empire.  On the other hand small festering groups of true believers like to fanatically drink the koolaid, so I donno whats worse, one evil empire or a billion little clans of crazies all disconnected from each other.<p>Patent something and transmit the patent FTL such that you can deliver a cease and desist at FTL speeds before a non-FTL player even gets to see they&#x27;ve been checkmated?",1374528997

Please elaborate on why you consider Snaphax to be unlawful circumvention.  I will assess the merits of your argument and then make a decision.<p>While people in this thread all give the customary knee-jerk &quot;get a lawyer&quot; response, consider that:<p>1. The request did not come from Snapchat&#x27;s lawyers, if they have any retained for the purpose of DMCA claims.  Surely they must, right?<p>2. It does not state what happens if Lackner does not comply.  There&#x27;s no threat of legal action.  It just asks Lackner to  remove the code from Github.<p>As such, there&#x27;s no reason not to ask Schaffer to clarify why he thinks there is a problem.<p>If lawyers are not involved yet, then asking questions is free.<p>If this was a clear DMCA violation, then why didn&#x27;t Schaffer send this to Snapchat&#x27;s lawyers to handle?<p>Maybe because he might not get the answer he wanted: that it&#x27;s a clear DMCA violation and an easy win for Snapchat.<p>Any lawyer can be asked to send a threatening DMCA violation letter.  They will almost always say, &quot;Yes, we can do that for you.&quot;<p>But sending a threatening letter does not mean it&#x27;s a slam dunk win if the recipient does not comply with the demands in the letter.  Sometimes threats are hollow.  The sender may have no intention of pursuing litigation any further than sending demand letters.  It simply might not be worth the money to pursue litigation over something like Snaphax.  If this bit of PHP was that big of a deal to Snapchat, why didn&#x27;t the request to remove it from Github come from Snapchat&#x27;s lawyers?  Where&#x27;s the line about purusing all legal remedies?<p>Not to mention that by sending a threatening letter with no details on why the sender thinks the code at issue is a DMCA violation, there&#x27;s a risk that the recipient might post a link to the code on HN and set off a &quot;Github fork bomb&quot;.

6086484,comment,6083770,6086024,6,0,andolanra,,,"The William Cook paper &#x27;On Understanding Data Abstraction&#x27; gives a basic formulation of pure objects. Crucially, an &#x27;object&#x27; needn&#x27;t be what the language <i>itself</i> calls an object, e.g. I could write up a &#x27;set object&#x27; in Haskell, which does not have objects:<p><pre><code>    data Set elem = Set { contains :: elem -> Bool }\n\n    insert :: (Eq elem) => elem -> Set elem -> Set elem\n    insert key set = Set { contains = c }\n      where c key&#x27; = if key == key&#x27; then True else contains set key\n\n    union :: (Eq elem) => Set elem -> Set elem -> Set elem\n    union set1 set2 = Set { contains = c }\n      where c key = contains set1 key || contains set2 key\n\n    emptySet :: Set elem\n    emptySet = Set { contains = (\\ _ -> False) }\n\n    -- mySet corresponds to {1,2,3}\n    mySet :: Set Int\n    mySet = insert 3 (insert 2 (insert 1 emptySet))\n\n    -- myVal is True\n    myVal :: Bool\n    myVal = contains mySet 2\n</code></pre>\nDepending on your definition of object-oriented programming, this could be considered an object or something else. William Cook argues that it&#x27;s an object <i>because access depends only on a public interface</i>, i.e. I could add another implementation<p><pre><code>    fromList :: (Eq elem) => [elem] -> Set elem\n    fromList list = Set { contains = c}\n      where c key = key `elem` list\n</code></pre>\nwhich uses a different representation underneath the surface, but the previous implementations of union and insert will work with it because it exposes the same interface... which is <i>not</i> the case with ML/OCaml modules, which must select a single implementation. This is a simplified version of the example Cook himself uses, so I urge you to read the paper if you want to understand more. (On the other hand, people in the Smalltalk/Ruby/&c camp will say, &quot;No, of course that&#x27;s not object-oriented—you&#x27;re not sending messages!&quot; So... it&#x27;s a complicated debate.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf</a> also linked by <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6084465"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6084465</a>",1374527523

Instead they viewed it as their religious duty to give their children the very best education they could so that we could make a positive difference in the world.<p>&quot;You would be amazed at the things people would give up if they thought &quot;God&quot; told them to.&quot;<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised at all. My parents made tremendous sacrifices to provide their children with a better life because they believed God wanted them to.<p>On the flip side, I have often seen people making poor decisions and attributing the decision to what they believed God wanted them to do. However, I don&#x27;t think it is at all obvious that this is caused by their belief in God. It seems more likely to me that in the absence of belief in God, they would make similarly poor decisions but give different justifications.",1374527181

6086454,comment,6084099,6085537,6,0,zanny,,,"Qt just released 5.1, which has prelimiary ios and Android support. By the end of the year, you will be able to write a Qt application, and use a QML ui. You can even use one single UI across all devices, where the UI dynamically adds or substracts elements depending on screen size. IE, responsive design for applications.<p>It is pretty close to write once, run anywhere. The only downside is if your app is the first qt app installed on an ios / android device, it forces a download of the shared libraries which are quite large. You also have to <i>build</i> the applications against individual platforms, since you are using C++, and the finished binary is a native application that uses the qt libraries to launch the qml engine and v8 for the javascript parts.<p>One experiment I am anxious to see come to fruition in the qt space is the KDE project to get qml apps running in the browser : <a href=""https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/www/qmlweb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/www/qmlweb</a>. Since QML is inherently javascript, a web app could only use javascript / qml to create a restrcited sandbox (or nacl / other browser equivalent for the c++ parts) and the entirety of qtquick is designed around high latency elements, so it can support network transport.",1374527147

2019847,comment,2019660,2019660,0,0,csomar,,,"The other day I have been looking at some of the large cities and countries. I'm a medicine student and if you have had the change for a deep study of the human body, you'll notice that humans and cities are quite similar.<p>A Country is the human body. Cities are like organs. They have similarities, but each one has got a special function/strength (industrial, financial, agricultural). Houses and building are like cells. Roads are like vessels. People and different products are like proteins, electrolytes, and chemical components. People channel in roads, they go by foot but also by car (different chemical components has car-like proteins to drive them in blood).<p>Let's get into a cell. It has different components: Wall, Mitochondria, kernel, ribosome... A house has similar things. It has a wall like the cell has, with openings which aren't just holes (doors in the house and special kind of proteins in the cell).<p>I really can't describe that clearly, due to my poor English and also to the complexity of the idea. I hope you get the idea and you try to expand it.<p>Another interesting point is how they both started. The city (in the dark ages) was very simple, and now has progressed. The same way for the human which started from a cell that has multiplied  and become a fully functioning animal.<p>Now cities don't start from 0, just like human. It doesn't need another billion year for a human to be created, but only 9 months, which is the same in the city.<p>I hope you get the idea, sorry for the bad release.",1292695105

In some of these fields, one of the bottlenecks seems to be the low numbers of researchers <i>worldwide</i> in the area. While the students do provide cheap labour, they also (depending on the fame of the professor) get immense networking resources. Since the field has comparatively few people, the big names all know each other, and all help get their students hired post-thesis.<p>Nepotism? Perhaps. But for the research program I'm thinking of in particular, if the problem does get solved, it'll revolutionize mathematics. Talking to some of the students involved, I feel that's why they're willing to put up with being cheap labor -- they're getting paid in happiness and a feeling of being worthy.",1292693256

Let's take a look at two examples.<p>> Example 1: Highschool dropout with no advanced education earning minimum wage; 23 years old:<p>Gross minimum wage for 23yo and above € 1424,40 per month, assuming a 40h workweek. Usually with paid overtime and some benefits depending on employer.<p>> Example 2: Student who excelled at high school until 18, completed bachelor at 21, completed master in science at 23, started PhD at 24:<p>Gross wage[1] €2000 per month, with realistically a 45h to 50h workweek. Better benefits and usually a 13th month. Intellectually more challenging work (probably), but few career possibilities in the academic field.<p>--<p>Also you have to take into account that the grad student has to pay substantially more in taxes than the minimum wage employee. The difference was only 1.5x to start with, after taxes the PhD student will probably only earn 25% more than the minimum wage employee. Just for the record, I'm not arguing against education here, or even making any statement about whether it makes sense to do a PhD. Just adding some numbers because your message makes it seem like PhDs are well compensated given their intelligence and the work they have to put in. From my point of view they're ridiculously underpaid.<p>A few of my friends are grad students, and they all live in 600 square feet (55 meter squared) apartments. It kind of sucks to live a 600 square foot apartment until you're 29-30, with no substantial savings for a down-payment on a house for after you graduate.<p>Source 1: <a href=""https://intranet.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=91ae4d5c-5d21-418c-ac03-e5b56efcd202&lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://intranet.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=91ae4d5c-5d21...</a>",1292692881

2019760,comment,2019665,2019695,0,0,grav1tas,,,"I have a feeling that you're equating a PhD with a Master's or Bachelor's degree.  The ultimate goal of a PhD is to prepare you to do 'real research' in that you're trained to collaborate with academics, dig through academic materials, compile results, and ultimately add to the knowledge of mankind.  This is fundamentally different from a BS or MS.  Replacing the academic setting for this, in my opinion, would be suboptimal, if not detrimental.  This is academia in its purest form almost...basically what it was originally intended to do!  Not train people for the job market, but to further the actual academic studies of everything!<p>What you're forgetting is that if there are a ton of hungry PhD's running around looking for work where your Joe-Master's Degree or Jim-Bachelor's Degrees are looking for work, chances are they may displace quite a few of those guys if they look to enter the standard work force.  Not because a PhD makes one inherently better, but because it seems like so many employers look at paper qualifications, and actually a lot of PhD's did work REALLY HARD to get their PhD...so at least they've shown they can work really hard on something and come up with a contribution.<p>Also, government budget cuts never seem to affect military research, where a TON of research dollars stems from.

I'm going to use Jane Street's alternative Core standard library for OCaml (<a href=""http://janestreet.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://janestreet.github.io/</a>) in my examples, because that's what I'm most familiar with.<p><i>First,</i> consciously raising an exception is far, far better than having an exception raised without you being aware of it. I can search OCaml code for all of the instances of <i>raise</i>, <i>failwith</i>, and <i>_exn</i>, and end up with a reasonable understanding of when my code might conceivably fail. I can't do the same thing in Java, because many of the functions I'm calling might return null.<p>And it's really not that hard to deal with optional values when you have them. Sure, it's slightly more verbose than not having to deal with null, but in practice you have to write a bunch of if statements checking if things are null everywhere anyway.<p>Also, most languages don't have good abstractions for dealing with nulls despite them being everywhere, so they're always painful. Languages like OCaml and Haskell do have good abstractions, so you can often avoid a lot of the verbosity: if you have an optional value and really do want to raise an exception (usually only in scripts/smaller programs), wrap your value in <i>Option.value_exn</i>. If you have a reasonable default value, call <i>Option.value ~default:(...)</i>. If you have a bunch of optional values together, you can sequence them together with Option.(>>=), because Option is a monad.<p><i>Second,</i> there are alternatives to raising exceptions in the middle of big programs. Consider the Or_error library (see <a href=""https://github.com/janestreet/core/blob/master/lib/or_error.mli"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/janestreet/core/blob/master/lib/or_error....</a>), which is a part of Core. Rather than having a type like Option everywhere:<p><pre><code>    type 'a option = Some 'a | None\n</code></pre>\nIt also has types like Or_error (defined approximately like this):<p><pre><code>    type 'a or_error = Ok 'a | Error Error.t\n</code></pre>\nError.t is a very useful type that lets you lazily construct error messages from values, so that you don't pay the (often high) cost of serializing things into a human-readable form until you actually decide you need the error message.<p>What this lets you do is write your code inside the Or_error monad. Because it's a monad, it's very easy to sequence error-generating operations together, and you don't have to check for errors unless you explicitly decide you want to.<p>Often, you can do something useful like log the error to a log file or display an alert, rather than killing off the entire program. Sometimes, of course, an error <i>is</i> bad enough that it should cause the program to die, and then you can make it terminate with Or_error.ok_exn. But that's relatively rare. If you're trying to write robust systems, many errors are things you can deal with intelligently, and having those errors encoded in the type system ensures you don't forget to do it.",1369537195

Better preboarding and seating on the planes is somewhat taken care of already by business+ class (you also get those airline clubs in the departure areas). This small chunk of benefits still costs too much for most consumers, with the vast majority of first/second class tickets acquired through flyer miles or corporate sponsorship.  Air taxi seating would cost even more than first class due to reduced economy of scale. Would this be worth it to skip the TSA line? I'm not sure.

Yes, to speak the federated protocol to another server you're going to be speaking the XML protocol, but between a server and a client that come to accommodations with each other, you don't really <i>have</i> to speak XML.<p>You'd want to speak something isomorphic to the XML, but the XMPP XML is not that verbose on a node-by-node basis or anything (minus a couple things, see below), it really is the XML, not the semantic content. It would be fairly easy for a medium-to-high skill developer to come up with an isomorphism for use with mobile clients. (It <i>is</i> sufficiently tricky that there would be a few traps that could catch the inexperienced or unwary (watch those namespaces!), but it isn't <i>that</i> difficult.) The end result is a more bandwidth efficient protocol that is a drop-in replacement at the XMPP library layer in the client for XMPP. (Of course, if your client is programmed to fling around XML all over the place internally this won't help, but, well, that's the price of failing to abstract properly.)<p>Where you'd still have trouble is things like roster size, but yes, there are XEPs for that, and before long you're looking at a reasonably svelte protocol (not perfectly, but <i>reasonably</i> svelte) that is still largely XMPP and easy to write communication with the outside world.<p>What's really difficult is semantic IM translation between entirely different systems, not protocol translation. ejabberd, the server whose internals I am most familiar with, essentially works by internally speaking Erlang terms with itself, and translating to the XML protocol only at the edges. It wouldn't be very hard to drop in different serialization at the edges and get a different protocol; as proof of concept of the fact this is possible, one could easily simply serialize those Erlang terms with Erlang's term serialization, and indeed, when operating ejabberd in a clustered mode, that's actually happening across the wire as the cluster nodes communicate with each other.<p>However much effort that may be, it seems easier than starting from scratch.",1369534569

It's just expenditure of capital. So the success of specific VCs aside, the way to measure the economic contribution of VC-funded startups is by looking at the return on investment of the sector as a whole. And since that return isn't great, relative to blue-chip companies, that tells us one of two things about the sector:<p>Either:\n1) VCs aren't great at the job of allocating capital to the right places; or \n2) VCs are doing the best job they can, and its just inherently difficult to separate the winners from the losers when it comes to startups.<p>My gut feeling is that the answer is (2), which implies that the nature of the industry is such that it's so hard to separate the winners from the losers that the gain from the exceptional success of the winners is largely offset by the cost of funding the losers, which makes the economic returns from the industry as a whole unexceptional compared to the returns from traditional blue chip companies.",1369534315

5769737,comment,5769166,5769609,5,0,Mikera,,,"Refcounting?? I thought that idea died years ago.<p>Refcounting is an extremely poor choice for memory management on modern machines. Even putting aside the issue that it can't handle cycles: constantly writing to memory to modify reference counts can be a huge performance hit (you often have to do it even when you are accessing objects in a read-only fashion). Also it requires extra memory on a per-object basis. Also it doesn't play nicely with concurrent threads. Also it's not cache friendly.<p>I'd expect any halfway-decent modern GC implementation to be significantly more efficient than reference counting.<p>About the only valid justification I can see nowadays for <i>not</i> using a GC is a hard-realtime latency requirement. Yep, GC pauses suck. But for efficient memory management in nontrivial systems, GCs are definitely the state of the art.",1369534012

Likewise, not having a degree does not free you to work on anything your heart desires. Earning a degree is one way to grow your strengths or fill in your weaknesses in a field. I can't see any situation where having a degree in any subject will make you worse off than not having a degree.

Then there are a whole host of other concerns that result from XML being text-based (cdata, preventing runaway parsing, etc). Not defending what Google has done, but the reality is XMPP is simply the most common among a lineup of really crappy chat/presence protocols.<p>Now, XML itself is one problem, but the ""culture"" (eg, usage norms) around XML is another -- much like Java's cultural preoccupation with abstraction and boilerplate, XML-based formats have a tendency to veer towards the unwieldy and verbose. XMPP is no exception.<p>While XMPP has been instrumental in propagating standardized presence and IM, its age is showing. Unless we develop a modern, open replacement that is natively suited to the needs of today's Internet (voice, video, file transfer, group messaging, etc+), we will see companies continue to develop proprietary solutions that are locked behind walled gardens.<p>+XEPs and extensions are insufficient; too many optional extensions hinders interop and contorts the system beyond its original design specifications.

I see the Sorite's Paradox pop up everywhere, and I'm frankly surprised to see it uniquely apply here.<p>How Much do I give? I frequently hand out $5s, $20s, on the principle that at that given time, given what is in my pocket and on my (spontaneously emerging) schedule, this cash would better service this chap, bloke, schizo, street-ranter, street-cryer, snot driveling, moaning, wailing, decaying, wasting -- stop me when you get my point.<p>Whence cometh Jesus?<p>On every occasion I give large sums, thinking ""not too large"" because well -- [insert tangent:] Today I stopped for a BIT too long to hand a bloke on the street a cigarette. I'm wearing my usual dapper attire. A second person accosts me. Then a third. Before I knew it, I had half a pack of cigarettes. I was handing out the first as a romantic gesture, latent in capitalism: ""Here's yr last cig, mate."" We all do it. Are you ready to buy a pack, walk out, hand them all out, and sleep without absurdity?<p>Are you calling for decentralized, anarchism liquidation? If you are, fucking say so. Because I've been fucking waiting for this day. If you tell me to fucking burn down a bank, don't leave it to my imagination to make out that you're trying to say that. This is becoming infuriating the way we programmers are writing.<p>I dropped a street violinist a $20. He MOANED at me, and STOPPED playing. I had to REMIND him that I listened to him from a hotel room from which I was staying for 45 minutes. He kept me sane, as a programmer isolated and stranded in a remote city. I could not communicate this to him.<p>Do you think green bills with ""God"" printed on them are the solution? This is NOT mature thinking. I just don't care.<p>Are you telling me I need a GTD strategy to liquidating my hard-earned, mentally crippling, psychologically and socially handicapping means for a living through this computer such that everyone on my street gets the average? Should I become a servant to the masses, when I'm already working for them in my own form of labor that I know?<p>Not to mention the opportunities for factionism and favoritism. Perhaps it's time for this. Perhaps this is what you are saying. But do I still have to accept that anarchism only works on paper? If I hand someone a bill and say, ""Thank Anarchism, not God. Thank the realization of postscarcity.""<p>I'll get slapped by mothers and gang members alike. It's just going to get spun as a hand out.",1369533727

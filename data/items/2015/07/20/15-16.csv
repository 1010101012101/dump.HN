9916847,comment,9907310,9909970,0,0,felixgallo,,,"I think your intuitions are incorrect.<p>1.  Preemptive multitasking is strictly better in almost all cases than cooperative multitasking, when you have <i>more</i> processes, not fewer; especially when these processes are heterogenous.  Throughput decreases over the best-case cooperative scenario, but jitter significantly decreases, and most importantly, you -- the user, the operator, or the programmer -- have a strong guarantee that the schedulers will never lock up because someone wrote code wrong.  That guarantee alone is why every operating system abandoned a cooperative model and pushed schedulers as close as possible to preemptive multitasking.<p>2.  Kernel scheduling is radically worse than user-space scheduling in nearly every scenario.  The kernel schedulers are necessarily very generic and workload-agnostic; kernel threads and the thread management infrastructure are incredibly heavyweight and slow relative to user space; the context switching penalty is gigantic; processes relying on kernel scheduling are forced to compete with other processes on the system; and the list goes on.  This is why unikernels, exokernels, and user-space tcp implementations like onload are growing prevalent, especially in the low-latency space.",1437407545

Others, do not.<p>This breaks down roughly along party lines, with one party running on moral purity and or authority and the other running on a more general concept of social justice and equality.  And that&#x27;s just for visualizing how it works.  There are strong purity factions everywhere.<p>When the purity people get caught out as unpure the shit hits the fan!  When others get caught out, the purity people go nuts, others may or may not have cause to comment, depending on how they evaluate the scenario.<p>President Bill Clinton is an example of the not running on purity person getting caught in some sex.  The purity crowd moved to impeach and we spent a lot of money.  In the end, he was not impeached, and the real judgement from the non-purity crowd was he was stupid, got caught, and his wife didn&#x27;t deserve any of the shit that came of it.<p>The purity crowd declared him impure, and deserving of the worst.<p>Wide stance Senator Stevens, &quot;the series of tubes guy&quot; is an example of the purity gone bad.  He, along with others, have run on an anti-gay platform, more generally &quot;family values&quot; and got caught soliciting gay sex.  Of course the purity crowd went nuts, and so did a lot of the nation on that one.<p>Reason:  Claiming purity while failing to say what one does and doing what one says.  Hypocrite was the judgement from the non-purity crowd, and impure, deserving of the worst was the judgement from the purity crowd.<p>It&#x27;s important to see that dynamic to understand how bizzare the USA is about sex and related things.<p>The majority of us are more sensitive to hypocrisy than we are any violations of purity, and the worst is generally to claim high purity, then not actually demonstrate it in how one lives their life.<p>It&#x27;s a wonder we got the gay marriage progress we did!<p>But there is something instructive there.  Don&#x27;t lie about your own moral sensibilities.  It&#x27;s better to be impure and honest than present as pure and not be.  Much better.<p>As more Americans work through this, we see more honesty regarding sex and with that, less overall insanity.<p>But it&#x27;s going to be a long while for that to play out more favorably in our society.  It may never actually, and that&#x27;s due to religion.  It&#x27;s not a particular sect or faith.  It&#x27;s just that our First Amendment has the effect of amplifying religion.  Given there is no State sanctioned one, religious people see the USA as a free state, ready to be claimed, or saved, or some other thing.<p>Or, if it&#x27;s not that, there is just a lot of freedom to get the word out, and so there are a lot of people getting that word out.<p>The media will play to this because eyeballs mean revenue.<p>And perhaps that is the last thing I would say.

Nearly every app on my phone is formatted for a small touchscreen, and not simply a desktop-sized program on a desktop shrunk to fit my phone screen (allowing me to zoom in and push a tiny cursor around). Form follows function, and so an app designed <i>for</i> a mobile device would look different than an app designed <i>for</i> a desktop computer. The hardware and capabilities are <i>very</i> different.<p>The great part is, with recent support in CSS we can build one site and target desktop users and mobile users with entirely different hardware, and give them a unified experience and layout that&#x27;s tailored to their device. When they use the desktop it&#x27;s the same website, fit to their screen and ready to be used with a mouse and keyboard. When it&#x27;s from a mobile device - all of the same information and actions are still there, just presented in a way that&#x27;s intuitive and natural to users of a mobile device.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever used a mobile simulator on a computer you&#x27;ll know how awkward it is to emulate the most natural and smooth fingertip gestures with a mouse. It&#x27;s clunky! Well trying to pretend you&#x27;re a desktop with a mouse when youve got a tiny screen and a big mouse (fingertip) is just as awkward and useless.<p>With zooming enabled, every tap you make takes 300ms longer to register because it&#x27;s listening to see if that tap is a tap or going to be part of a zooming gesture.<p>I design my stuff to look good <i>well beyond</i> normal tolerances for screen sizes, and trust me - I am not your enemy here. I do what I do to give the best experience and if zooming ended with an easier-to-use experience then for sure I would enable it.<p>I do a lot of other things to make it easy for mobile users too:<p>- use tel inputs for numerical entry (mobile users get a keypad instead of a keyboard)<p>- user email inputs for emails and turn off autocapitlize (mobile users get a keyboard with an &#x27;@&#x27; symbol)<p>- use retina graphics, or render imagery in code for retina and pixel-dense displays<p>- every layout I create works from 300px-1500px, and some of the more important elements in the layout I may get working from 200px-2000px to be certain they will work everywhere.<p>- I use a massive wish-list of fonts that includes great defaults for OS X, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS<p>- I use the least amount of JavaScript that makes sense to accomplish what I need to do (I hate sites that constantly crash the tab on mobile)<p>- I add offline and web-app tags according to the project to help users who may add the site to home screen have the best experience (not all sites are built for web app mod)<p>- I also add in special icons just for mobile users so if they bookmark the site they will have a nice icon as well<p>- I disable text-selection or pointer-events for items that may be errantly tapped on, or to help you be able to more easily select text you are <i>trying</i> to select on mobile. Text selection, copy, and paste on mobile is a magnitude more difficult than for a desktop user<p>So I&#x27;m not just disabling it because somebody told me to, or showed me that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done. I work hard and develop, and <i>use</i> these devices, and building a desktop site you can pan around does <i>not</i> provide as good an experience as a <i>properly designed</i> responsive site.<p>I&#x27;m a mobile user too, trust me when I say I fight <i>for</i> your experience to be the best there is!",1437406166

9916632,comment,9915791,9915791,0,0,cgearhart,,,"The only fallacy here is the idea that workers always make rational choices. While some workers may be willing to work for less than the cost of staying alive -- or otherwise compromise on their needs (not wants) -- in order to compete for jobs, we (as a society) should not allow them to work for that rate because it creates downward pressure on wages (forcing more rational workers to compete at an unsustainable price), and otherwise undermines the stability of the economy.<p>This trope about the evils of regulation ignores that it is possible for the market equilibrium to exist below the cost of survival. Modern society has acknowledged that &quot;survival&quot; includes a number of things that haven&#x27;t traditionally been included like healthcare, retirement, and more. Wages don&#x27;t scale on a continuum, and there is a floor beneath which a worker cannot survive in a given economy. When these benefits aren&#x27;t provided by an employer, they end up being subsidized by the government (particularly in the US).<p>It is reasonable, as a society, to require that the businesses that participate (and benefit) in our economy uphold a minimum level of compensation for their employees in order to increase social stability and reduce overall reliance on government support.",1437405913

I took several months last year to work on it full-time and got an alpha version working, which taught me a ton of things I didn&#x27;t know I didn&#x27;t know about the problem I&#x27;m tackling. Now, I&#x27;m working on a beta based on lessons learned from the alpha.<p>The product is a way to answer the simple yet awful question, &quot;What changed?&quot; Configuration change is the primary cause of failure in complex software systems. But the part that breaks isn&#x27;t necessarily the part that changes. For example, a database schema change can break apps that rely on the database. But in large organizations, where the database is administrated by an entirely different team from app development and developers may not even be allowed to look at the production environment, it&#x27;s a huge pain point.<p>Detecting configuration change and finding the relationships and impact is a really difficult and challenging problem. The biggest takeaway from the alpha for me was that &quot;noise shaping&quot; is a hard problem. For example, Wordpress alters the schema of its MySQL database several times a day. It&#x27;s a tiny thing (an autoincrement value on a single column), but it makes sorting important changes like upgrades that only happen weekly or monthly or yearly from unimportant changes that happen daily.<p>The trick now is to get a product out of it good enough to make money, so I can afford to quit dayjobbing and live off my own creation, rather than sitting at someone else&#x27;s desk and counting the number of times a day I wish I had my own product here to help solve the problems I deal with over and over, every damned day.",1437405780

This knife was to be suitable for use by the army in opening canned food and disassembling the Swiss service rifle, the Schmidt–Rubin, which required a screwdriver for assembly.\nIn January 1891, the knife received the official designation Modell 1890. The knife had a blade, reamer, can-opener, screwdriver, and grips made out of dark oak wood that was later partly replaced with ebony wood.<p>Photo: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_knife#/media/File:Wester_%26_Co_2.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_knife#/media/File:W...</a>",1437405582

Sure he was at his &quot;dream job&quot; but the jokes and insults from his negative boss drove him to quit. It wasn&#x27;t really his choice to quit, it was more he was driven out by an his boss who was a douchebag.<p>And the Ellen Poe situation? Quitting is completely different than being set up to fail. Again, using her as an example of &quot;goal disengagement&quot; completely misunderstands her whole situation. She was set up to fail, then driven into submission by the inmates who are running the asylum at Reddit.<p>If you want to use a better example, try Robert Smith, the running back for the Vikings who abruptly quit after a career year in the NFL. He was about to get a huge contract extension, but he gave up the money so he could pursue a career in medicine. He also wanted to get out of the NFL without any lingering physical issues.

9916542,comment,9913994,9915179,0,0,pdkl95,,,"I&#x27;ve never understood why <i>anybody</i> would think that central planning would ever work. The very idea is total hubris - before you even get to the decision making process, you need <i>accurate data</i> to work from. It should be painfully obvious that data about (and especially provided by) humans is at best an approximate representation of reality. Often, it is completely wrong. Real-time noise is still noise.<p>If you want proof of this, consider why work-to-rule[1] works. While it is obviously intended to be used as a type of strike or similar direct action, the idea is that you are technically doing you job <i>too accurately</i>. The work continues to function thanks to the fact that almost nobody does everything they are technically supposed to do. We speed on the way to work, we overlook minor mistakes, we fix instructions and reinterpret orders. Reports are regularly sent up the chain of command that &quot;yes, project $FOO was finished on time&quot; even though everybody involved knows it wasn&#x27;t.<p>The idea that you can take known-bad data, apply it to a fantastically complex model, iterate that model to add unknown amounts of chaotic noise, and get usable results is completely insane. Given the realities of how bureaucracies work, that noise will simply be re-interpreted until it says whatever the people involved want it to say. In the end, it is still a situation where the people making decisions are distanced from the consequences of their decisions.<p>If you want to fix some of the problems we have, I suggest that we need a lot more of the <i>opposite</i> of central planning: local decision making authority. A control system tends to work better when it can get accurate and immediate feedback, and in human terms that means experiencing - or at least directly seeing - the consequences of any decision. We, as a species, are notoriously terrible at evaluating any decision where the consequences are not felt immediately and personally.<p>[1] <a href=""http://libcom.org/organise/work-to-rule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libcom.org/organise/work-to-rule</a>",1437404992

Just because it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> for someone below median income to start a business doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll do so at the same rate as people who are richer.

(Advertising which transmits useful information, e.g. &quot;taxis suck and Uber exists&quot;, is not zero sum.)<p>But you also gloss over one of the big benefits of a non-centralized system - correctly finding the utility function. In a centrally planned system, your utility function needs to properly identify what tradeoffs people <i>would</i> make if they had the choice. This is not easy, and modern computing doesn&#x27;t help very much here.<p>In contrast, consumer choice via price systems handles this nicely.",1437404586

9902109,story,,,5,3,brainless,"Ask HN: Can community owned marketplace/exchange/protocol exist? Are there any?",,"Problem:
On a daily basis, people all over the world use various marketplaces on the Internet to exchange, buy or sell different things. From jobs to houses, everything is being traded online. There are companies which are competing to create their own marketplaces, but the more I use these, the more I feel there should be a common/better way.<p>Current situation:
Each marketplace has its own UI, app, API, rules to go through very similar &quot;kinds&quot; of information. And there are yet different ones for each geography although most of the information maintains very similar properties.<p>Each job site or house rental site or car sharing site or others have their own format. And then we have aggregators who make their own UI, app, API...<p>Thus my question:
Could there not be a common standard protocol to share demands or supply information? People who want add listings contribute together to bear the cost to maintain the information storage, search, retrieval. The cost per person or company would literally be pennies, since the population is very large. It could be P2P too, I am not particularly sure how to maintain this. But I want to understand if I am the only one seeing this issue.",1437130790

9902106,comment,9901915,9901915,0,0,Nelyah,,,"I will take the point of view of someone who went to college. Actually I just graduated from my 5th year(I think it&#x27;s master degree) and going to PhD in computer science. 
To understand what I want to explain, you need to know that I began college with 3 years of biology, and then switch to computer science. It is only in my 3rd year that I realised how much I loved computer science. I worked my ass off to get directly from 3rd year of biology to 4th year of computer science, so I basically learnt everything by myself too. 
In the end, I felt that every &quot;practical&quot; classes were pointless. I don&#x27;t need someone to learn a new language, and it seems you don&#x27;t either. But it is when I tried some theoretical courses that I realized how much I had to learn in this domain.<p>I never learnt anything about advanced algorithmic, or graph theory before, or language semantics. But in the end, by knowing all that I really look at a problem with a different point of view than before. I am able to imagine some new tricky algorithm etc.<p>All of that to say : It depends on what you seek going to college. You will be bored if it&#x27;s just learning some new language, because you either know them already, or you will go faster than the course. But if you want to learn some more theoretical knowledge, you will learn some new stuff for sure. 
Then again, I don&#x27;t know where you live, and college might be quite expensive in some country, so I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really worth the money (since you already have some years as a developper). But it is totally worth the time imo.",1437130749

When these devices rejoin the network, they will force a new election as their term will be much higher than the leader. This leads to frequently disconnected devices becoming the leader when reattached to the network, thus causing regular unavailability of the system when they leave again.<p>> [...]<p>> It is also interesting to consider the impact of a single node being behind an asymmetric partition [...] This node will repeatedly re-run elections as it will not be able to receive incoming messages, each RequestVotes will have a higher term than the last, forcing the leader to step down.<p>Specifically, they required to add client request caches, exposing serial transaction IDs in every single record and log entry, specific timeouts and measures for livelock bugs this introduced, which include replacing an entry by a noop value to be replicated on some read-only operation done at a later time. On top of this, these modifications may end up reducing the serializability constructs to bring it closer to what a Master-Follower replication may give in a DB -- i.e. it doesn&#x27;t guarantee one true serializable sequence of commits anymore, but only that the state replication will be consistent across all nodes",1437129245

I thought I was being <i>very</i> productive. But then I started to measure my effectiveness (purely out of interest rather than any belief I wasn&#x27;t working well) - I measured my billable hours, lines of code, commits, issues fixed, etc. Over the course of about 3 months I found that I did less work when I was in front of the screen for 12 hours compared to 8 hours. Spending more time in front of my computer <i>reduced</i> my effectiveness. I put the reasons down to the fact I could do exercise, sleep better, have a social life, etc - by being healthier I work better. That said, my Counterstrike skills completely disappeared, so there were downsides.<p>My suggestion would be to take a few hours to build something that tracks how well you work, and then vary the hours you put in for a while. See what happens.<p>Regarding your eyes, try to make your screen brightness match the ambient level of light in your environment, sit at a distance where you don&#x27;t need to actively focus (use glasses if necessary), and pick a theme for your IDE that&#x27;s quite dark.

And even though it raised some interesting points that I completely agree with, he builds his argument based on some inaccuracies. Most importantly, his writing gives the impression that autoconf was written by some dot-com wunderkinder.<p>Autoconf&#x27;s wikipedia page says it first appeared in 1991, very likely to solve configure problems of the mid-to-late 1980s. That&#x27;s as far from dot-com as you can get.<p>He also bashes the m4 macro language. I have never learnt the language but it&#x27;s possible the obscurity of the langauge is due to not a lot of people spending time to learn it. And should they? I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I do know the motivation for why m4 was created. It was meant to be a feature-rich and consistent alternative to the C preprocessor which is full of warts and is not turing complete (which m4 is). There are C programs out there written without a single line of &#x27;#&#x27; magic, using m4 preprocessor instead. You could say m4 syntax ugly, but you cannot easily defend that there is no need for a turing complete, preferably general purpose, macro language. C++ templates try to provide another alternative, and unsurprisingly, are known to be one of the syntactically complex aspects of the language.<p>And today we don&#x27;t have Cray and DEC and all those obscure architectures, but we do have ARM, and 32/64, and GPUs, and so on. So the architecture proliferation doesn&#x27;t look like dying anytime soon. And we have the autoconf/configure alternative LLVM, very loosely speaking (an attempt to let one source code work with multiple architectures), which is by many standards an order of magnitude more complex than the former.<p>Just trying to put things in perspective.",1437128494

If you are going to design a language you have to consider a lot more than static versus dynamic.<p>I would say that the two main camps were typed versus untyped not static versus dynamic.<p>What about functional versus imperative versus actor.<p>So, in my opinion it dives much too deep into implementation much to quickly without any meaningful discussion of the design of the language or the process of designing a language.<p>Or, perhaps it&#x27;s just the title that is wrong.",1437127666

Cars that are so complicated; the owner is forced to bring it to the shop for every hiccup.  A lot of cars/and trucks from the late 80&#x27;s to around 2008, are pretty easy to work on, and with the proper maintence can last 300,000 miles.  And if your not afraid of getting your hands dirty--you will never have to pay a mechanic $120/hr to work on your vechicle.  These newer vehicles are so complicated--a lot of shops do a lot of learning on your dime.  (I have a Toyota with a 22R engine.  It has one 350,000 miles and it&#x27;s never seen a mechanic--except for smog checks, and never failed once. Actually it did fail once, but it was due to an error in a Motor Emmission publication.  If you have an older car, and need a 
Smog check; make sure your smog shop has access to Mitchell manuals online(OnDemand5).  They are highly accurate!<p>My dad gave me some good advice years ago.  He told me to buy a year specific service manual for every automobile you ever buy.",1437127650

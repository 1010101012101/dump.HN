452999,comment,451432,452462,0,0,dasil003,,,"I was a professional PHP developer for 4 years before picking up Drupal.  I studied it.  I read books on it.  I built a half dozen sites with it.  I participated in the forums.  I submitted a couple patches.  One thing I never did is ""untar the package on the server"" because I'm a real developer and of course I have my dev environment set up locally.  Deployments are pulled from source control.<p>My closing statements were definitely hyperbole, but I fundamentally stand by them, both as a web designer and a developer.  My opinion comes from experience, which I believe is more informed than looking at a bunch of sites without knowing what went in to each one.<p>The thing with Drupal is that it caters to generic needs very well.  It will get you 95% of the way on any project with moderately standard functionality.  However the last 5% includes fine design and usability touches that I take as a point of professional pride.<p>I had one project where I built the whole thing in Drupal in about 20 hours.  After crossing the finish line, the client was unhappy with the checkout flow from the e-commerce section.  I wasn't happy with it either, but it was just the way the module worked.  Although there was no reason we couldn't re-work the e-commerce module, there was no modularity or unit tests to help with this kind of refactoring.  I estimated the rewrite to be somewhere in the 20-80 hour range given the potential for massive breakage.  In the end we decided to cut our losses and spend 40 hours rewriting in Rails.  We fixed a lot of other design details along the way, and we have a lean 2000-line code base that we could extend in any reasonable fashion.  Sure we couldn't drop in a forum/gallery/blog/library at the drop of a hat, but is it more important to have a million pieces of generic functionality at the tip of your fingers or to get the core user experience correct?  It's bad enough when you have to fight with the client to get the UI right, but what I find truly unbearable is when everyone's on the same page, the ideal UI is clear, the logic is simple, yet you're encumbered by technology that's designed to solve 1000 extra problems you don't have at all.",1233100124

Having said that, things would be better for free software contributors and users if Microsoft were merely passively uninterested in software freedom.<p>I think the first thing for them to do is to stop actively opposing the free software community. Microsoft has repeatedly attacked free software projects on the .NET platform, from NUnit to NAnt to NDoc, by launching alternatives with few or no technical advantages. This not only destroys momentum, but it strengthens the cultural tendency among Microsoft customers to distrust anything that does not originate in Redmond.<p>Lately Microsoft has released some of their software under liberal licensing terms.

452962,comment,452341,452341,0,0,vlad,,,"There's a good point to this I want to mention.  THere is a good way to tell when you're a prefectionist.  (Evefybody goes through this, some more than others.)<p>I am righjt now in the I-dont-careab-out-perfection mode, which actually feels nice.  This is so because I had a boring winter break without much contact with people, so when college started up again, I didn't care ab out being obsessed over stupid things, I'm just happy to be taking a lot of classes, where the fine details are just so minute to me right now.<p>So I can tell you right now that yes, acceptance of yourself (e.g. confidence) is true.  Another is trusting your intuition 100%.  Inotherwords, I had decided to let my left-brain just take care of things without worrying about the beautiy, structure, form, etc that the right-brain always doubts us to.  The more we learn about what it takes to be a professional in something, the more our right-brain tries to stop us.  So I thought I should just trust my left-brain to just do whatever tasks my eyes and brain remind me to do, and it's been working great.  Feels liberating.<p>But here's the point of what I wanted to say.  HEre's how you can tell when you're in the perfectionism zone.<p>It's when you constantly notice people nitpicking you, and you actually realize that it is happening, and you point it out.  All three things happen.<p>Lets go over them each one.<p>First, I said nitpcking, not just someone actually giving true, very useful differences.  For example, I wrote spring semester instead of winter semester in the top half of this comment.  Since I'm ignoring stupid spelling and minor grammar errors for now (Something I never do, if you read my other posts) to prove a point, I still changed spring to winter because that was a genuine thing that was a problem or a bug with the comment.  I also just now rearranged some wording a few sentences prior, where i moved the parenthesis--because it was confusing.  I didn't care that thew ord Something was capitalized for on reason.  But a big grammar mistake, sure that's importnat to fix because it means hte reader has to read over three times to understand, but itf its just a spelling mistake, then its okay.<p>So what I notice happening is that people are constantly nitpicking by saying things that were clearly not thought out, either jokes or trying to show how smart they are by saying do x , y or z.  In all those cases, they were not actual useful feedback, but just a way for a person to feel like they're contributing or smart.  So that stuff you can ignore.  The point is that when ur not a perfectionist, as I am not right now, then you notice this.<p>Number two, you point it out, like I said.  You feel comfortable expressing confusion (what an idiot the person is for suggesting somethign that is the same thing but said off the cuff, what a waste of my time, if it's insulting), or SUnday and today, there was a girl who just would not stop nitpicking or be quiet.  SO I would tell her she was controlling and annoying and I Just said it straight up.  She literally would not stop 4 or 5 times in both cases to keep making some nitpicking in something, giving wilder and crazier things.<p>ANd the last thing would be of course to realize it's happening, which most people don't.  THere's notnhing more freeing than to know that what you juts did is of value and easy to understand, and if there's one or 400 spelling errosr its okay.  Of course in this case im overdoingit.  And the flow of text is easy to follow, as I fixed any big mistakes.  But I am not modifying things because of being insecure or worried, any changes I made were because something I wrote, if I left it like that, would be tought to parse.  So I hope this helps and of course I""m not going to sepnd 1 hour (seriously, thats what I do sometimes) fixing a post.",1233098640

The real economic value (let alone environmental/social value) of modern roles have not had time to become embedded in longstanding tradition.<p>If we make decisions based on tradition, we blind ourselves to everything that is made possible by the unique place in history we find ourselves in. I think it's a dangerous time to do so. You cannot live as though nuclear warheads have not been invented, just because it feels good to respect old institutions. You cannot live as though there are 500 million people on the planet, when there are 6 billion, just because it feels good to follow in the footsteps of your forefathers.<p>Human culture does a fantastic job of making people feel important by building rich traditions around important roles in society. For 99% of human history that was probably very useful; most of the time it made sense to adapt to existing institutions, because they were likely to be around for the rest of your life. But that's no longer true.<p>I think ""life"" asks us to wake up and smell the coffee. Neither the problems we face today nor the tools that may solve them are embedded in tradition and institution. The slower we are to adapt, the longer we remain stuck on old habits, the more harm we'll cause by pouring energy into systems designed to solve yesterday's problems.",1233098295

Statistics? Data? Evidence? I guess those are obsolete too now that we have the cloud. You see Dare, unlike with automobile mechanics, people have an alternative with things like storage. They have plenty of easily available storage right on their computer. Also, people don't trust mechanics with charging a fair price. To apply the mechanics analogy to clouds, it would be like a mechanic that goes out of business and takes your car with him, never to return again.<p><i>Given the massive adoption of the Web from search engines and e-commerce sites to Web-based email and social networking services, it is clear that the average computer person trusts the cloud enough to part with their personal information and their money.</i><p>Search engines have <i>nothing</i> to do with giving up personal information. Web-based email has been successful because people associate email is very much associated with the web (think of all the sites that need to email you in some way). In what sense are social networks cloud-like?<p><i>the average computer user doesn't have a data backup strategy than it is likely to occur if their information is stored on some Web company's servers</i><p>Another unjustified claim. Giving a personal anecdote is not proof.<p>Articles like these make me more and more confused about what the cloud really is. Is it just about storing information online? In that case, this entire phenomenon is hyped up several degrees more than ""web 2.0"" and should be thought of as nothing more than marketing-speak. Storing information online is nothing to be excited about, how sexy does ""cloud"" sound when you realize it just means some data is saved on a network of servers somewhere.",1233098233

I went directly into a PhD program. The first two years I hated my life, and I would have agreed with you then.  Now, my life has completely changed.<p>First of all, it takes a while to build a new community.  Grad school (and just life after college) is just different. You are no longer a part of the same social groups. You also have to find a project you are passionate about.  For the first two years I was working on something I hated. I made a critical decision to switch and I haven't looked back.<p>Second, coming back to do PhD is not easy. As more time passes from undergrad, the more bills you have to pay, the harder it is to get recommendations, and the higher expectations will be. Passing your qualifying exam may be tougher.<p>Third, a PhD does not rail you to anywhere. It OPENS doors.  American students do not fully comprehend this fact, and as such, American PhD students are the minority in most PhD programs.",1233098150

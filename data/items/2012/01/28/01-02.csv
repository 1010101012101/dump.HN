A pitch that you've found some important, but uncommercialized, recent scientific or technical advances that you see a market niche for can be well-received. A pitch that you're going to <i>make</i> some significant scientific or technical advances as part of your startup's R&D effort is usually seen as way too much risk: a VC does not want ""major scientific advance"" to be in your critical path. The result is that the significant R&D has to happen elsewhere (often academia) to produce the stock of not-yet-commercialized results that startups can build on, rather than being produced by the startups themselves, since they can't have significant/risky R&D in their critical paths. Even Google, for example, only got funded <i>after</i> significant R&D work had been done by the founders in grad school.<p>Seems less true in biotech, where VCs are willing to fund substantial R&D budgets, perhaps because the [breakthrough -> patent -> license] ecosystem is better established there; the tech startups using the breakthrough/patent/license pipeline seem to verge on patent trolls more than real R&D outfits.",1327715262

3521050,comment,3520871,3520871,5,0,tokenadult,,,"One of the odd things about many businesses that involve providing expert services is that clients partly evaluate quality by assuming that high-price providers must have better quality. That may or may not be true, but if you are dedicated to developing your craft, you can learn how to provide high-quality services. Then you should make sure to bill for those high-quality services, to get proper return from your investment in developing your skills.<p>My wife is a solo-practice businesswoman (a piano teacher). From the beginning, I have advised her always to set her rates as high as those she hears about from other teachers in town. I know enough about her musicianship and her thoroughness as a teacher to know that she is worth as much as any piano teacher in town, and every minute that she contracts for at a lower price is a minute she could have contracted for at a higher price. Over the years, she has had quite a few long-term clients, and she has become quite busy. She is very grateful, of course, to clients she had when she was still building up her portfolio of clients. But whenever she adjusts her rates or her terms, she eventually sends out notifications of the new rates and terms to ALL clients, and the clients she wants to keep stick with her lessons. She has been sufficiently busy for a few years now that if a client balks at terms or conditions, she thanks them for their previous business and moves on. There is no need to keep a bothersome client in a world full of clients who are looking for the work to be done well and are willing to pay for that. Just make clear what terms properly reward you for your skill, and keep your life from being too bothersome, and serve the clients who meet those terms.",1327715032

3521029,comment,3519952,3519952,11,0,Osiris,,,"As someone who comes from a Windows (and further-back, OS/2) background, the directory structure of -nix systems is baffling. It's really interesting to read the background on why it came to be structured a certain way, but I feel that the current structure doesn't jive with how we use computers in a modern way.  The structure seems to be optimized for single-file command-line based applications and are not well suited to today's much more complicated GUI applications.<p>Mac OS X, I think, has done a decent job of structuring the file system to be more user friendly despite the -nix background.<p>Modern use cases typically revolve around either installation and use of specific applications, often with dozens or hundreds of files needed, and data storage. In Windows/Mac, applications (for the most part) are installed into their own individual application folder and a GUI (as opposed to the PATH) is used to provide easy access to the application.  This makes it easy to 1) know where to put a program you're installing, 2) know how to locate a program after install, and 3) keeps all the application components in a single place for easy move or removal.<p>In my somewhat limited experience with Linux, I find that the complicated nature of the file system makes package management systems necessary to simply keep track of where all the files are: executable in /usr/local/share/bin, configuration files in /etc, libraries in /usr/lib, and I'm not sure where non-binary resources of an application get stored.<p>I once installed my favorite browser (Opera) in Ubuntu. It didn't make a desktop or Applcation menu icon for some reason, so I figured I'd just go make a icon to point to it. It took quite a while to just figure out where the executable was at.<p>This could very well be one of the reasons that many people find Linux on the desktop difficult to use. They don't understand where anything goes.<p>I hope that one day one Linux distribution will at least step up and consider restructuring the file system to be more friendly and straight forward and to take advantage of the availability of long file names.",1327714604

I certainly believe that Facebook will increase the amount of revenue per user, but there is where I believe that they can do a lot but not too much without risking to crunch.<p>I really liked your Dawkins/Dennett reference. In this case, I believe that people feel like Facebook is unstoppable and that can do more than Google, Apple, Microsoft and so on. In my opinion this is understandable since so many people spend time on it that they can't believe it'll disappear.<p>The reason why I think they are wrong just relies on how I think these things go. I am not saying that Facebook will stop growing or disappear in less than 2 years, I would be just silly.<p>I'm saying that if you compare Google, Microsoft and Apple, just to mention few of the big ones, to Facebook, they have many many more products. It's true that the search doesn't increase too much in the US for Google, but they are developing many products like wallet or automated cars or (huge list). Apple is doing the same.<p>But I think that there is a physical limit. How can a software company (maybe also hardware in the future), be orders and orders of magnitude larger than all the other ones. By the time you are so much bigger than the other ones, natural selection rules start pressuring you and you'll have to stop trying to be everything.<p>Now, Apple is probably considered to be worth $500B and Microsoft and Google a couple of hundred billions, and, to me, Facebook still needs to do a lot of work to shift enough to be like them. The difference is that they have only one product: a website. If they start losing Facebook users, they might not have a lot of time to shift, because they might lose them all. Yahoo made some mistakes when they were pretty strong and lost traction.<p>Will Facebook be able to sustain the impact of a $100B evaluation without making (big) mistakes?<p>Maybe I'm naive, but I believe that they will start selling physical things and will have their OS and all that, but just because they will become an entire world like PC vs MAC vs Linux then they will probably sattle near those companies, probably at the same order of magnitude evaluation.<p>Speaking of memes, maybe I'm naive, again, but something called Facebook can only cross some lines, but it can't be the internet or too much related to a product that doesn't exist any more.<p>Shifting is very complex in a world where the imprinting is so strong (try play loose the first game of poker with some players, they will be convinced you are a loose player for a long time, even if you are a tight player and played loose only the first game to throw them off).<p>Same, in my opinion, goes with Dropbox. They can probably absorb the $250M investment to buy more servers/expand/develop new features. But it triggers my attention when a company does that. Because first, it basically means that they will never sell any more (to whom at this point? Facebook maybe? ;-) ). And second, because I wonder why a company that is supposed to have something on the order of $250M revenue per year needs a $250M investment. It scares me (it scares me also becuase they don't seem very concerned about security). And the meme is strange also over there. Can I immagine some sort of generic OS or product called dropbox? I can sell harddrives called dropbox, I can sell a place where to look at pictures called dropbox, I can sell some sort of Netflix machine called dropbox, but can I sell a phone called dropbox? Or a laptop? Again, I'm not saying they'll crash or anything. But I'm just looking at them with suspicion, maybe intrigued to see what they come up with.<p>It's all about ""shifting wisely"" after all when you get so big, and unlike Google and Apple that accomplished so much shifting, Facebook so far has shifted very very little (and so has Dropbox). The code is maybe different, the look maybe a little more elegant, the platform for developers maybe a lot more elaborated, but overall it's still pretty maniacally and maybe dangerously close to what it was on day 1.<p>OK sorry, I didn't mean to write an essay!

Obviously since anyone can SAY they are part of Anonymous, some of the things 'promoted' by Anonymous aren't actually supported by a majority of the group, which i feel both the media and many people fail to realize.<p>From what I can see, Anonymous is mainly concerned with showing the public the problems with today's society. In my opinion, the methods might be slightly extreme but that's really the only way they are going to be able to inform the public of the issues that need to be addressed:\nthrough media attention.<p>I want to be clear however, this is just my opinion and I\nam in no way promoting or even associated with the group.",1327712595

But even if I don't submit the story, the chances are good that someone else will. By submitting it myself, I can control the timing; in particular, I can make sure to be available to respond to comments. In any case, if people don't vote it up, the story will soon disappear.",1327712539

It could be 1 year, it could be 50 years. (I wouldn't put it at 100 or above personally, barring global catastrophe.) So we do things in parallel and hedge our bets. Could we get a self-sustaining colony on the Moon (or Mars, or somewhere else) within 50 years if we tried? I think we could. And that instantly protects modern humanity from many existential threats while we continue to work on problem #3.",1327712538

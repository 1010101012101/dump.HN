Your comment here fits the tone he used when responding to the few questions that were allowed at the talk I saw (if memory serves, he went over time and so Q&A was abbreviated).<p>His strongest points discussed the indoctrination of children into using only proprietary software while in schools.

In Russia (and whole ex-Soviet space pretty much), the corruption is spread through and through the society. It is like a metastasized cancer.<p>It starts with grade school where you have to bribe the teacher so they don't lower the grades of your child, you have to bribe your way out of a traffic ticket, you have to pay ""extra"" to not be ignored by nurses in a hospital, you have to pay public officials under the table to pretty much do anything. Then it goes to the top -- if you run a small business you often have to keep paying larger sums to avoid a mountains of artificially created red-tape, if you are unlucky you might have to also pay protection money to the local police/mafia. Then it gets worse as you go higher. Once you reach a certain level then you really have to start worrying about your life.  Contract killings are just part of the business there.",1303714129

However, it requires an experienced project manager / system architect leading the outsourced development.<p>From what I heard and personally experienced, it all goes wrong when someone who has an idea, explains it in plain english to their outsourced dev point of contact.  The vision is 90% clear and the devs don't know your business as well as you do and they start building.  As developers charged with finishing a job within a deadline, they find it more expedient to make seemingly innocuous decisions while coding (as opposed to stopping mid-stream to email you and burn a whole  rest of the working day until they get your answer tomorrow).  A series of small decisions compound, along with the major decisions they do come to you about, but you lack the technical expertise to make (so you default to their knowledge) and BOOM!.",1303714088

I've been to both Indonesia and the Philippines for business over the last three years and I observed that, compared to the pace in the west, development is significantly faster resulting in a quicker increase of quality of life. However my feeling is that Indonesia surpasses most of the neighbouring countries by far in both the quality and volume of its development, maybe excluding China.<p>On the plus side, we encountered an open market which makes placing new products and ideas easy. Internet users are reasonably experienced, our server logs show that Indonesian visitors use modern browsers and understand common UI concepts easily. It has a thriving tech and startup scene and is well-connected. Indonesia is the second biggest Facebook user and we found that you can indeed efficiently reach people over Facebook.<p>The cons we encountered so far are few, but they hurt. Throughout our communication with either individuals, the media or businesses we found a recurring pattern of either ignoring our communication attempts (mail, twitter, phonecalls, facebook) or deliberately misreading them regardless of them being on a business or personal level. As soon as we switched to personal contact (we visited them) the situation improved, leading me to believe that they have some catching up to do with modern media.",1303711679

We're not talking about measuring the rate of cellular mitosis in a lab, this is about how persuasive Stallman is as a speaker for his cause. You can follow him around to 50+ speaking engagements meticulously collecting metrics and come to the same conclusion you'd get listening to the buzz after a few of them and adhering to rules of thumb for public speaking developed over the past 5000 years, if you'd like. The difference is if everyone did it your way no one would ever get anything done (and they'd probably do it worse).<p>And let's not act as though this guy is in some camp that is opposite to Stallman's in the first place. They clearly share a lot of same values.<p>>How much time should he devote to exploring unsupported ideas from those who disagree, versus his own ideas for persuasion?<p>Perhaps you should more clearly explain the link between the efficacy of a person's rhetorical strategies and their opinion on a given subject first.",1303711619

Most skydivers are also socially awkward and come from very different walks of life.

If there is a problem with unequal access to resources then solve that problem directly. Positive discrimination attempts to apply a band-aid to the problem after the damage has been done. And this fix is so broad that it may actually worsen the inequality of resources situation for many people.",1402966721

7902313,comment,7897244,7898843,1,0,brc,,,"I wasn&#x27;t trying to define communism - if I was doing that I would say it was the public ownership of the means of production - or something along those lines.<p>A better way of putting it would be &#x27;all countries who have turned to communism have a lack of freedom to change the status quo&#x27;.  It&#x27;s not the definition of communism - or even one of it&#x27;s stated goals - but the lack of ability for individuals to benefit from their efforts creates a situation where the status quo is difficult to change.<p>Your example of China illustrates this perfectly - all the while that mao-ist communism held sway, China went nowhere - or backwards - in terms of changing.  The current weak-communism allows people to retain the rewards of their benefits - and so the dynamism of china has increased greatly.<p>I&#x27;m not talking at the single voter level - I&#x27;m more talking at the Bill Gates/Steve Jobs/Elon Musk level.  You need strong individual change agents to move the whole game forwards, and in a publicly-owned, incentive destroying regime, these individuals never flourish.  That is what entrenches the status quo, and that is why communism is characterized by a lack of status quo.  There certainly is no argument that communism causes stagnation, the results are quite shocking even if you remove the tendency for brutal dictators to leverage themselves into the position of power and murder their opponents.<p>I agree that democracy at the federal level is very flawed, particularly in the EU, but also in the US, where Federal departments and laws overrule too many local and state laws.  The success of Federalism lies in the reuiqrements of individual regions to compete in terms of opportunity and the ability of like-minded people to gather and control their destiny.   Texas and Oregon should be allowed to evolve in different directions, as should Sweden and Greece.   Forcing harmonious regultions and taxation on them makes both areas feel aggrieved.  The benefits from Federalism are really about applicability of similar laws, common defense and completely free trade within the borders.  The drawbacks are losing your voice by vote dilution.  The balance has to be at the point where a federal government is limited as to the extent it can override state laws.",1402966139

A harbor authority may have provided a guarantee to assume responsibility for environmental problems, in order to be granted the relevant rights of way, or it may be on the other side of the law, filing suit against a company which has damaged its income stream.  Landowners or municipalities can file suit for damage caused to a beach, and fishermen, environmental tour companies, or governments can file suit for damage to ecosystems.<p>In the United States, the EPA has absolved many companies of any responsibility, or at least greatly diminished the corporations&#x27; costs, by depriving damaged parties of a cause of action, as the EPA has the sole responsibility for many forms of pollution, and their regulation.<p>Free markets are not very different from mixed systems in dealing with issues like climate change, but they do make it plain to each individual that they are directly responsible for the outcomes which come to pass.  This responsibility is more effective in regulating action than one might think.<p>In a market system, entities at fault may be defunct by the time the repercussions of their actions are apparent; on the other hand, politicians are rarely held to account on any single issue, and they are often more ephemeral than large corporations; the bureaucrats responsible for regulation are never held to account for any results at all.",1402965981

I don&#x27;t think crb was suggesting a 1 GB volume.<p>As for the specific case you describe - looking for 30 IOPS consistently on a 50 GB volume, with Google, there is no need to go to SSD for that or to pay $16.25/month.<p>- If you meant 30 random reads, you can hit that with 100GB of Standard PD for $4.00/month (with no IO charges)<p>- If you meant 30 random writes, it&#x27;s less as 50 GB gets you 75 random write IOPS for $2.00/month (with no IO charges)<p>At Google, we&#x27;ve tried to bring consistency of performance even to the lower tier of block storage so no matter what level of IO you need, you can count on seeing a consistent level between volumes and over time.<p>So, how do you choose between the two PD types?  As a very coarse rule of thumb:<p>- If you are looking for 2 random read IOPS / GB or less, growing Standard PD volumes to meet the IOPS needs is the most cost effective route<p>- If you are looking for 2-30 IOPS/GB, SSD Persistent Disk gets you the better value",1402965505

If you can find a kids show you can tolerate, it&#x27;s better because you get a bit simpler sentence structure. So watch our TV with subtitles you understand fluently. Also read in English, fiction or non-fiction but nothing technical, start with kids&#x27; books, work your way up. Read with a dictionary at your side and look up every word you don&#x27;t know.

Sitting or walking or riding bikes side by side, you don&#x27;t have to focus on their physical cues as much, and you can chat casually.

Porter was quoted recently in the NYT as saying: &quot;If Clay and I differ, it’s that Clay sees disruption everywhere, in every business, whereas I see it as something that happens every once in a while... And what looks like disruption is in fact an incumbent firm not embracing innovation [at all].&quot;[1]<p>The NYT article cited is in many ways a much better illustration of what I think Lepore is trying to get at in this article, namely that disruption is not a universal theory of technology in business. That&#x27;s a view I&#x27;m very sympathetic towards. Lepore ends up making the bigger claim that the theory has no predictive power and is only a useless after the fact justification for why businesses perform in certain ways. I think that&#x27;s totally unjustified. If business theories were as certain as calculus we&#x27;d all be rich, but none of them are. That doesn&#x27;t make them useless, and the theory of disruption certainly isn&#x27;t so vague as to be useless.<p>Because Lepore isn&#x27;t across the field in any detail, the article ends up being a mix of side swipes at Christensen and caricatures of people in the startup community. When you have to go through the bibliography of someone&#x27;s book to find fault with the choice of a reference to a tangential point (as the author has done here), you start to come across as ranting rather than making a point of any value.<p>I think the second last page is revealing though, as the author (who is an American History professor at Harvard) takes aim at the application of disruption to universities. There&#x27;s a big problem here, because most academics are pedagogues who love education for the sake of education, and can&#x27;t accept or can&#x27;t see that for most people, university is a job certification factory rather than a place of intellectual inquiry. I read a lot of MOOC and disruption-hate from academics, and much of it tends to stem from this problem. We&#x27;re talking each other and I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s only going to get worse.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/business/business-school-disrupted.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/business/business-school-d...</a>",1402964882

We&#x27;re not talking executive protection or major event security. An average armed guard in my city would be lucky to make $15/hr. For $35/hr you can hire an off duty police officer. A quick google shows the mean security guard salary is ~32k in SF and 75% of $36k, so even with a 50/50 split a guard working 40hrs would be making normal wages and bringing home $35k a year.<p>There&#x27;s a ton of small events (think a 100 attendee unconference) that may be required to hire security for legal/insurance/contract reasons. Many event spaces require you to hire security whenever alcohol is served. Small events like that where showing up an hour ahead of time is plenty to figure out where the exits are, who&#x27;s in charge, etc. I could see this being useful for smaller restaurants/clubs/bars that don&#x27;t have an established relationship with a security provider and could use this to call in security only on the busy nights.<p>Of course, I also see people using this for parties at their house/office just for the image of having a party so &#x27;exclusive&#x27; there was a bouncer. People who need real actual security will look elsewhere and pay much more.",1402964237

Everything we see, everywhere, points to this.<p>Yes but if I understand them correctly most modern scientists think that &quot;everything we see&quot; is only a miniscule fragment of the universe.  The vast majority of the universe they assert is invisible and it&#x27;s characteristics are said to be unknown to man.  They use placeholder words to describe the vast majority of the universe such as &quot;dark energy&quot; or &quot;dark matter&quot;.<p>If you hold to such a view then how is it reasonable to assume that science has enough data to draw any conclusions about the mechanics of the universe as a whole ?  Isn&#x27;t it analogous to the proverbial blind man who feels one small part of an elephant and assumes he understands what it is and how it works ?<p>To be clear I haven&#x27;t been arguing against the existence of randomness nor against the existence of the big bang, because truly I don&#x27;t hold any beliefs either for or against their existence.  I&#x27;m just honest enough to admit that I don&#x27;t know, whereas it seems most academics at least are convinced that they do know.  My larger point is simply that science does not have the means by which to ascertain whether or not these things exist or ever have existed with any kind of reasonable accuracy.<p>Society just likes to pretend that we know more than we really do for political reasons and because it makes us feel more at ease in general.

After I started counting, I counted like eight low-impact bicycle accidents involving twenty-something girls before it started getting cold in September (it averaged to nearly once a week). I&#x27;m going to estimate that prior to counting it was about three or four (it had to be more than two), before it struck me that it was getting repetitive. Once I started paying attention, I was kind of surprised at how frequent and consistent it was. None of them drew blood or broke bones or anything, but the ones that I noticed were usually accompanied by a surprised yell, and enough to make people stop and check for concussions. As far as I witnessed, I did not see any similar accidents involving males in their 20&#x27;s, or adult women of other age groups. On the other hand, lots of 40 and 50 something women are always out riding bikes with their kids and husbands.<p>Bicycles in NYC are serious business though. I&#x27;ve known people who were slapped with hundreds of dollars in violations <i>and</i> summonses in one sitting. I know one guy who was car-doored on a narrow street and woke up hospitalized and missing teeth. I&#x27;ve also heard similar stories of males and females drunk bicycling home at night that also ended in serious hospital visits.<p>More often than not, males in their 20&#x27;s are on skateboards, and certainly falling a lot, but usually with a degree of anticipation and a strategy for absorbing and surviving the fall. Otherwise, males under 40 and not on skateboards seem to be keenly aware of their own lack of athletic inclination and poorly trained physical coordination (myself included; I like my teeth).",1402963921

[0]<p>But there&#x27;s one essential problem: you are selling a limited resource for a very low price, which will cause problems later on. And the rate is unreasonably low.<p>First, the easy bit. What is $29/mo to a decent freelancer? One hour of work for a beginner. And (ideally) the value the person gets back is at $300-$X000. So if it gives such a massive value, why pay so little? The users would be happy to pay more.<p>$29/h is not much, and it will take a while to make it sustainable. So your motivation is to grow user base. But growing user base would increase competition and will make it worse for your users. By charging more, you could focus more on your value proposition, spend more times on leads rather than new users.<p>Also, I wouldn&#x27;t commit to X leads/day. Leads are finite and limited. Would I be happy if you promise 5 weekly leads and you deliver 10? Yes. Would I be happy if you promise 20 weekly leads and deliver 15? No, you under delivered, I didn&#x27;t sign for this. Under promise and over deliver is much better.<p>And distributing leads is another problem.

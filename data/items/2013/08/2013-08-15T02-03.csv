But, even our understanding of DNA need not be applicable to other life forms.<p>I don&#x27;t see why there has to be any real limitation on conditions or otherwise. As the article mentions,  we have been surprised to find extremophiles near thermal vents right here on Earth (which reach temperatures roughly equivalent to the Venusian surface). There we find, for instance, bacteria that rely upon hydrogen sulfide vs sunlight for energy. This is what we consider a &quot;harsh&quot; environment of chemicals, heat, pressure, etc. However, when we attempt to remove organisms from that environment to study them, they usually die pretty quickly. In other words, ours is the harsh environment as far as they are concerned.<p>Elsewhere, we have found organisms whose DNA was thought to be composed of arsenic vs phosphorous. While this was ultimately refuted, for a period we once again thought we&#x27;d discovered something that, in an instant, completely changed our understanding of life.<p>So, I guess my point is that we assume life must conform to certain requirements and/or conditions until we find life forms that violate our assumptions.

The smarter ones, i suggest might not use it for petty crap, but for min/maxing on skipping class and going to a party, or putting of school for a year or two to run with a good idea.  I say smarter ones, because they are just looking at more variables to crunch.<p>Secondly, the financial backing of one&#x27;s support system, or family, has a lot to do with mitigating the downsides of intensive and/or risky projects.  If mom and dad are more successful or stable, there is more of a safety net.  Couch surfing and ramen/starving might not be for everyone, so a better safety net means less downside.<p>Self esteem vs low self esteem is a big one too.  This correlates to socio-economic economic status.  Self esteem will let one believe in their good idea, instead of letting someone tell them it&#x27;s stupid.<p>I will agree that the article is slanted twords rich kids, they just had more bonuses.<p>The interesting thing to me, is I think if you look at middle class entrepreneurs, they will be running their businesses taking less risk (service businesses as tradesmen / lawncare / contracting / etc) for less reward, but are fitting the same mold.",1376532849

However you have written the report quite lazily and haven&#x27;t taken the time to clearly explain the steps. For example you have said &quot;mark profile&quot; instead of &quot;Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s profile&quot;. That&#x27;s just ambiguous language and confuses the reader. They probably receive a lot of wrong reports every day so if you make mistakes like that you are less likely to be taken seriously.<p>The part where Khalil writes &quot;mark profile&quot; is the way it is said in Arabic because Arabic has no capitalization. There is no &quot;apostrophe + s&quot; in Arabic either.<p>The violation of TOS is a obviously a violation, but the language barrier thing again. The TOS is not in Arabic.<p>Finally:<p>> - Just because they fail to receive your bug report does not make it ok for you to go ahead and exploit it.<p>The word &quot;exploit&quot; is not the right word here. He didn&#x27;t exploit the bug, he demonstrated it, albeit in a poor way but it wasn&#x27;t an exploitation.",1377003558

So, what they <i>will</i> be incentivized to do, is to make <i>whitelisting</i> a blacklisted site (especially those that only get loaded through invisible iframes etc.) have a much simpler/easier/clearer UX, so that their complaints go down.

Terrorism is a supply and demand thing. Killing babies gets some people excited and motivated. On the other side. Its like the war on drugs, that overlooks the DEMAND for drugs. Terrorism is borne out of a demand for bloodshed.  The terrorists just supply the blood of women and children, because that&#x27;s the lowest hanging fruit (the easiest high, if you will). So, at some level, I still agree with you that these&#x27; people are f&#x27;d up to be so bloodthirsty, its really still a more complex problem.  As long as a baby killer is a hero, we will have baby killers.

Breaching these rights may be warranted in certain specific situations (just as free speech is), but the current processes don&#x27;t seem to go far enough to protect us. Even freedom of speech seems to have been curtailed too far in recent years. We need to have the political will to push back on this.

However the electricity is not particularly the dangerous thing about them, it is the 9000F arc you are making and the molten steel. So to demonstrate that we shouldn&#x27;t freak out about the electric danger and worry more about the heat, my instructor had someone touch the business end with one hand and the ground electrode with the other. Bit of a tingle but certainly didn&#x27;t stop their heart or anything. Welders are kept at low voltage for this reason.<p>I assume that it must be somewhat dangerous because of the responder guides warning, but I would want to know the actual voltage before drawing conclusions. If the voltage is 112 or less (or even 220 or less), it should be possible to be pretty safe with some fairly manageable precautions.",1377000897

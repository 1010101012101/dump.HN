I averaged about 70 words per minute on QWERTY and got back to this speed in Dvorak after about 4 months. I don't buy the claim that a person can switch to the Dvorak in 25 days. Took me almost that long just to be able to type with the Dvorak without looking at the keyboard. The DVAssist program for Windows was very helpful in the transition stage.<p>Wikipedia claims the fastest typist in the world uses a Dvorak.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard</a> so you draw your own conclusions about speed from this<p>I am sticking to the Dvorak because I don't feel as much strain on my wrist as compared to using a QWERTY. I have had a pain in my right wrist which hasn't occurred since I started the Dvorak. (Note: It could also be due to the slowdown in speed during the transition process).If I get an increase in speed it is a bonus.<p>A small bonus on using the Dvorak is that I don't need to bother about people looking at my keyboard when I am typing my password.<p>Cons:\n1) Pair programming is a pain if the other guy doesn't use Dvorak. Having to switch keyboard layouts often isn't fun, unless of course your workplace allows you to install DVAssist\n2) When using outside terminals, such as Internet cafe, it is highly unlikely you are going to be able to switch keyboard layout.\n3) On a Mac, the shortcuts still follow the QWERTY keyboard, so the Apple-C key is really an Apple J key.<p>Signed\nA QWERTY keyboard typist for 25 years",1264228998

1071468,comment,1070683,1070686,0,0,dasil003,,,"This is just the tip of the iceberg in Rails 3.  The architectural changes are widespread.  Things like routing and generators are straight replaced with much more powerful versions. both those things need to be rewritten on a <i>completely</i> different API.  The layout of the API docs is dramatically different with components shifted all over the place.  This may well be frustrating to existing app developers who have a more modest pace of development and just want to focus on incremental improvements.  However if you look at the modularity and flexibility these changes bring, you'll realize that Rails 3 is now several orders of magnitude more flexible and it becomes viable for a much larger set of problem domains.<p>The Rails core team is not content to dramatically slow down improvements to accommodate an installed base, they want to take advantage of good ideas and keep Rails at the forefront of web development--and this is not change for change's sake, all the deprecations and outright replacements are <i>well</i> justified.<p>There's no doubt this will wreak havoc with traditional teams maintaining mature apps that don't have the budget or interest to spend time refactoring existing code.  I do feel their pain.  But old code still runs.  You have the choice of sticking with 2.3.x or else capitalizing on powerful new improvements.  The only choice they've taken away is the ability to sort of putter along on a series of bland updates to a mature framework.  Maybe that's where Rails will be in another 5 years, but not today.",1264228696

Southern Pacific Railroad (whose case was ruled in favor of Southern Pacific on a technicality rather than any explicit ruling on the personhood of corporations).

I see what you're getting at.<p>What I've learned is that anyone can learn Rails, or Git, or whatever buzzwordy thing is the latest language, tool, or framework. It's easy to learn these things because they are new, hip, and promise productivity increases. I thik it's good to try new things, but things like this aren't that hard to try, if you're really into programming. They have pretty shallow learning curves, and give pretty instant gratification: the double-whammy of what makes a good hacker flavor-of-the-month.<p>Learning these types of things is fun, easy, and good. You never know what the next big thing might be. And, you probably will come across a few gems you keep with you for many years. You also probably pass through a lot of crap.<p>It's much harder to learn things that take time and patience, that don't provide the instant gratification of learning a new framework or whiz bang tool chain.<p>You need to take the long view. Programming languages are a means of expression, they don't make you write better code.<p>What makes you write better code is the hard stuff. The stuff you lose if you don't practice. The stuff nobody has the time to sit down and <i>really learn</i>. Linear algebra, statistics, physics, machine learning, machine vision, game theory, logic, information retrieval, network theory, the list goes on. It's much easier to pick up a ""Foobar in Action"" book that has no scary math symbols or floating point values that can get you from 0 to ""Hello World"" in a few hours.<p>But, you will always be just another code monkey that way, following the leaders. I'd rather have totally shitty, ugly code written in BASIC that expressed some novel algorithm that nobody else had than yet another CRUD application written in Clojure in the cloud with jQuery and WebSockets.<p>Put down the Pragmatic Programmers books every once in a while, turn off your computer, and start reading about the basics.

1071436,comment,1069548,1069548,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Reminds me of a theory I came up with awhile ago.  Why do little humans have such a strong propensity for sticking everything in their mouths?  Well, way back when in the stone age, infant mortality was high.  Mortality among the newborn is high for many species.  As a result, low tech-level human communities don't invest in a little individual until they make it in the world for awhile.  In fact, the little buggers haven't really had <i>that</i> many physical resources devoted to them.  It takes a lot of food to make a baby.  But that's peanuts to the resources invested in an adult over 2 decades of life.  So who should be the food taster?  Who should try things out to see if they're safe to eat?  That's right, all those little ones!<p>It actually makes evolutionary sense for little humans to want to stick random things in their mouths and so become unwitting food tasters.  It's better for the community, overall.<p>(Also, it puts pressure on mothers to be <i>attentive</i>!

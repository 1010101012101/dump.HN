6398394,comment,6395274,6396410,6,0,toyg,,,"1) I think the OSS landscape has simply changed. We used to have a handful of languages and frameworks with cryptic documentation, which O&#x27;Reilly books could coalesce in definitive bibles. Now you have new stuff coming out every day, github repositories all over the place, new tools, languages on top of languages... It&#x27;s much harder to figure out what matters and what not. In that sense, O&#x27;Reilly is holding better than most other publishers, in what is probably a lost war (things will accelerate more and more, to the point where relevant point-in-time documentation will become impossible to produce in book format).<p>2) I agree on this. I wrote it down to the spirit of &quot;American optimism&quot; that us Europeans can find a bit distasteful, and sometimes it just seems too self-serving, fanning the flames of this or that technological phenomenon in order to sell more books. However, that&#x27;s his job, and at least he tries to bring some open debate on the topics rather than leaving big players to come out with The Next Big Thing on their own.<p>3) All O&#x27;Reilly eBooks get automatically synchronised to your Dropbox folder in pdf, ePub and Mobi, which I think is a fantastic story for mobile (could do with better Kindle integration I guess, but Amazon holds the keys to that particular kingdom). I&#x27;ve never used Safari tbh, I&#x27;m not a fan of subscriptions.",1379411367

I&#x27;ve had very little luck getting even stuff that works fine on XP to run on 7. I&#x27;m not blaming Microsoft, I know they&#x27;re going to great lengths for backwards compatibility. But I don&#x27;t see old games running on new systems as a given, not on Windows, not on any other platform/OS.<p>> As for the reason why &quot;old&quot; games are important, it&#x27;s because they offer a back-catalog, you open your store with a very large selection.

6398359,comment,6398025,6398322,2,0,smackay,,,"Unless there is some kind of apocalypse (rinderpest making it to the USA due to global warming) then the decline in meat production might be (relatively) gradual. The main use of antibiotics in agriculture (AFAIK) is simply to aid fattening animals as they are sick for fewer days of the year and so can put on more weight. Reduce antibiotic use and the market weight of animals will decline and either prices will have to rise or demand will fall as people move to other sources of protein - assuming there are reasonable/viable alternatives.<p>I&#x27;m not sure there will be many political effects - unless of course people are going hungry, however the economic effects might be interesting. If intensive meat production stopped then perhaps there would be more free-range or extensive meat available (certainly at a higher price). Environmentally this might not be a bad thing, for example, the integrated olive/chestnut, goat/pig agriculture we have here in Portugal is pretty good for wildlife. More animals wandering over a wider area would be good for vultures as well (which are in rapid decline globally). Admittedly this is probably a limited scenario but it illustrates that there are desirable alternatives to highly intensive agriculture.<p>Aside: The economics of meat production seem pretty crazy to me. I can go to my local supermarket and purchase several meals worth of fatty pork for less than the price of a couple of heads of broccoli and and few carrots. Given it takes a lot more resources to produce the pork that suggests that the system we have is seriously out of whack.<p>Caveat: Off course, we might not be able to carpet the globe in goats to make this all work. It&#x27;s just not going to be possible (or at least very difficult) to do this with a population well in excess of 10 billion.",1379410127

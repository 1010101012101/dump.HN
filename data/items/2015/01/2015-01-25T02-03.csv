If you&#x27;re in a big-co and want to switch to a startup, you&#x27;ll take a salary hit. If you just want out of your job because it&#x27;s dead-end or your boss is a psychopath, any number may do.<p>Let&#x27;s assume you want a market salary -- you can still know your market and know your worth but let them name a number first.<p>The assumption is generally if an employer names a number first it&#x27;s going to be on the low end of their scale. Therefore, there is room up to negotiate to get to your actual value.<p>Suppose hypothetically you know your worth to be $120K. You don&#x27;t say anything, and the employer comes out with $100K. You can negotiate for that other $20K since you know what your worth is. If money isn&#x27;t a factor (&quot;extremely flexible about pay&quot;) or if they really can&#x27;t pay you that much, you can negotiate on secondary benefits like vacation time, reimbursements, and travel/training budgets. Would you take $110K and $15K of benefits instead of a $120K salary and $2K of benefits? Some people might.<p>Suppose you did say $120K, they can still try to price you down by price anchoring you to their initial offer of $100K. They&#x27;ll go into the benefits, the intangibles, and the value of their benefits relative to the compensation -- how the &quot;catered daily lunch&quot; is actually like $X of salary for example. Maybe you go back and forth on negotiations and end somewhere around the first scenario.<p>Another way this could go is you state your salary, and their lowest offer was above yours. While it could be attributed to not knowing the market or valuing yourselves, it could be because you don&#x27;t know their salary bands. This company either really wants you or just plain pays more than &quot;market&quot;. If they&#x27;re thinking $130K and you say $120K, you&#x27;ll lose out on $10K/year.",1422154780

As projects move from in progress to something we&#x27;re willing to attach the word &#x27;done&#x27; to, the folks working on them either pick up the next best thing on the list (that is, the next thing on the list for which they&#x27;re the best suited person to own it) or they find another project where the owner is looking for some help and pitch in. Engineers are mostly expected to self-allocate based on what we understand to be really super important rather than simply really important.<p>The projects are sometimes defined internally (&quot;Hey guys, wouldn&#x27;t it be neat if...&quot;) and sometimes externally; rarely do they have hard ship dates associated with them[0]. Additionally, individual components have moderately well defined ownership, although this can shift over time as people&#x27;s interests change (for example, I currently own the virtual NIC presented to GCE guests, so I tend to end up on networking projects).<p>My experience is that (for us) this works fairly well. From time to time someone puts on their manager hat (someone who actually has direct reports, that is) and asks people to shuffle around a bit. My experience with this workflow has been uniformly happier than my time (prior to Google) working with sprints, story points, and rigid deadlines that always slipped anyway.<p>Again, this is not necessarily indicative of how Google works in general, and your mileage may vary.

Dialyzer can definitely do that, you just need to specify a type that is a tuple:<p><pre><code>    -type something() :: {Thing  :: thingtype(),
                          Thing2 :: thing2type()}.
    %% ...
    -spec foo(something()) -> thingtype().

But I agree that Dialyzer can feel incomplete. It&#x27;s been a little while now but I recall having to use `term()&#x27; in specs (basically, untyped) to suppress false positives in some cases. It was also quite slow.<p>Still, a much better situation than Ruby.",1422154696

Are you really going to argue that &quot;roads, bridges, water, and sewer systems&quot; are 10x as expensive in one place as in the other?<p>No, &quot;what you are paying for&quot; is the artificial scarcity created by restrictive zoning codes and NIMBYs.  If the city council let me build on one of the many open fields around I-280 tomorrow, I could get it constructed for a pittance-- and then turn around and sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.<p><i>PS: There is a completely reasonable argument that building a new house or apartment complex should pay their fair share of existing infrastructure ~10k-50+k/person in most areas. That this does not happen is simply a form of corruption as zoning becomes a quick way to massively change the value of land after purchase.</i><p>Do you understand how &quot;the existing infrastructure&quot; is funded?

Did not support threads, no.<p>There was a thing called &quot;Desk Accessories&quot;, sort of single-window mini apps (think Calculator), that were implemented as a special kind of device driver. But IIRC even these were serviced by periodic calls to SystemTask() which would make sure every running device got some time.<p>To get around this, we hacked the OS in crazy ways. For example, all of the system APIs were in a big address table. So if you had loaded some code and wanted to get a little slice of execution time to yourself, patching your function&#x27;s address into the table in place of SystemTask() was a common technique (not forgetting to call to the original SystemTask() address before finishing, of course)! Since <i>everyone</i> did this (including Apple), you can imagine the long sequences of hacks patching on top of each other would lead to a really unstable system. Hence the classic Mac OS reputation.<p>I once wrote a driver for a custom-built hardware keyboard which plugged in via the serial port. The keyboard driver was basically a Control Panel (CDEV) with an INIT resource that patched something (I&#x27;m guessing SystemTask() but my memory is hazy...not sure why I didn&#x27;t just make it a straight-up device driver) to check for bytes from the keyboard, which it would post into the event queue, and they&#x27;d show up in the running application.<p>Another common technique for getting time slices was to use the interrupt manager, although that was dicey because calling into system APIs at interrupt time wasn&#x27;t safe.<p>Caveat: it&#x27;s been a long time.",1422153215

Belichick says that the team went over the process they use for games a few days ago and they determine that the preparation process they use for their footballs (which he claims they do right up to the point they are given to officials for pre-game testing) increases the air pressure in the balls by about 1 psi [1]. Therefore, the balls appear legal when tested by officials, but after a few hours of sitting around, the pressure reduces to below the legal limit.

Sure, you get working and officially-supported frameworks, but the goalposts are always shifting further down the field, and I think that's intentional on Microsoft's part.",1284742797

This is a hinderance to using Microsoft products in many projects. Use the same technologies as everyone else and do it right! Screw XPS, Screw WinRM (or tunnel it over SSH like normal people). We're too busy to learn The New Way To Do $foo This Year.<p>- Stop reimplementing the wheels everyone else uses. A good example is the XPS vs PDF war. Everyone else uses PDF, it's a reasonably open standard, just USE IT. Do go create your own ""value-added"" garbage.<p>- Your enterprise products are not only not free, they're costly. I can use a free open source web application stack that is at least as good as ASP.NET/ASP.NET MVC. I love Visual Studio though. BizSpark is a start, but what about those of us doing large scale community/""hobby""/not-for-profit projects?<p>- Ballmer's leadership sucks. Every time I read one of his stupid quotes about his stance on $foo, I cringe.<p>- blogs.msdn.com is gold. Keep this program and the openness from the engineers going!<p>- Stop the inter/intra product group fighting that ends up hurting the end users.

1701735,story,,,2,1,uptown,"The Implosion of a Groupon Digital Rip-Off Artist",,"There's been a lot of article about Groupon lately, but I find yesterday's events to be among the most fascinating.  The short version is that Groupon offered a coupon for a one-hour photo-shoot with a photographer named Dana Dawes.  Based on the sales volume, the participating photograher committed herself to an unrealistic number of hours of work at an unsustainable rate.  While this is a problem in itself, the bigger story only unfolded when Groupon customers started noticing that the quality of some of the photographer's photographs seemed to deviate wildly from others.  It was determined that she had stolen photographs from other photographers on the web, watermarked them with her own business name, and posted them to her portfolio.<p>TechCrunch covered the problematic promotion here:
http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/16/groupon-photography/<p>There's an archive of the original Groupon discussion thread here:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2138676/discussion.html<p>The photographer came up with a variety of excuses which she posted to the Groupon discussion forum.  First she claimed her site was hacked.  This excuse is problematic because if true, the same hacker would have had to hack into her Facebook profile and post the same photos there as well.  It's also confusing what incentive a ""hacker"" would have to conduct such an act.  The photos called into question began to disappear from her site.  On the Groupon thread, the photographer claimed that she was not the one removing the photographs because somebody had reset her password and she was unable to access her site.  It's unclear why somebody that went to the trouble of watermarking stolen photographs to add to her portfolio would then go to the trouble of removing those same photographs.  They were also removed from her Facebook page.<p>A flurry of users popped up in the Groupon discussion thread to defend Dana's name.  Unfortunately, some of these posters seemed to mixup who they were and responded to questions posted to other users.  This lead many to believe that Dana may have posted using multiple usernames.  In fact, if you search on the web you can find that a Fivver.com user with a similar name has offered this service for sale in the past.  Google Cache holds a copy of a previous Fivver.com listing offering seven Yelp.com reviews of your business using multiple usernames:<p>http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:EVQcMOfXg4QJ:www.fiverr.com/users/dkdawes/gigs/write-7-reviews-for-your-business-service-or-prdoduct-on-yelpcom+dkdawes&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a<p>If you don't own a business, or have a need for her photography, but instead have homework you'd like answered then somebody with an identical name as Dana is offering test answers and homework solutions for $5 each:<p>http://studentoffortune.com/user/dkdawes79/questions_answered<p>While the ""hacker"" may have been nice enough to remove these photos from her business website and Facebook page, apparently they forgot to remove these same photos from her Me.com portfolio.  Those are still available online here:<p>http://gallery.me.com/dkdawes#100015<p>To me, this case perfectly highlights both the beautiful-side and the ugly-side of the internet, and the business it has spawned.  It's become easier than ever to get your products in front of potential customers, while at the same time ... this same access has made it just as easy for those with malicious intent to exploit this type of situation for personal gain.",1284741279

  Agent Brown: Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions.

</code></pre>
Ever since I started starting companies I have been looking for co-founders, engineers, hackers and developers.<p>It seems to me that the best co-founders are not the greatest coders, but they are relentless and extremely open-minded. In fact they probably will write crappy code that needs to be fixed later, but it got done and the company moved on.  They don't care about code quality, they care about relationships, about milestones.  They read books, and they like a variety of tasks, each requiring focus and effort.  They are happy doing stuff alone, and getting people to come along.<p>As for developers they can make a good thing, and make it better, even great. They take a vision and make it possible.  They are usually shy.<p>Engineers seem to be about the truth in process or systems, and they are one step away from idealistic scientists.<p>Hackers are more like artists. Code, and computers are just like a paintbrush for them. They need to be inspired, and they bend the perception of what is possible. Impossible is not in their vocabulary. They are OCD and love focusing intently on one beautiful problem at a time. Maybe hackers should never be employees. Hire them as consultants. Give them their freedom.<p>The best employees have always been developers, but they are risk adverse. Engineers should only be hired for a 20+ sized company.<p>Hackers and cofounders are the best people to start companies with as they seek risk reward scenarios.",1284740744

They will work on weekends and evenings without too much complaint, but form my experience as an employee, there are very few humans willing to work those kinds of hours and be happy about it. On an odd occasion when needs must, yes, but every day and every week will always lead to the inevitable. For most people (and maybe even more so in the UK), working at a startup is just another job, maybe not to you, but to them it will be. I also found as a PhD student those who worked longer hours never finished any quicker than those who enjoyed their time a little more - this is only my personal experience though.

1701610,comment,1700293,1701220,0,0,jseliger,,,"This is a good post and accurate one; it also describes how my family's business basically runs -- as a business. We do grant writing for nonprofit and public agencies (<a href=""http://blog.seliger.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.seliger.com/about/</a>), and most of our clients and more than half of our revenue comes from shortish (6 to 8 week) clients. But it's run... like a business.<p>However, one thing I'd point out is that most businesses don't have the immediate cashflow to hire an assistant right out the gate, and many businesses that eventually charge $100+ / hour don't start that way as they try to acquire clients and get some amount of money going. When I was a little kid and my parents were starting the firm, my Dad routinely worked 80 – 90 hour weeks -- and that is not an exaggeration. He <i>couldn't</i> have hired someone else to do the scut work at the time.<p>I think there are two lessons to take from this, which isn't to discount your observation -- as soon as you <i>can</i> afford someone in a secretary / office manager type role, get them, but you might not be able to --<p>1) Do anything it takes to survive. pg calls this ""maximizing your runway"" and so forth, but that's the basic idea.<p>2) Do something that, ideally, everyone else <i>isn't</i> doing. We're basically the only non-specialist grant writing firm in the country. No one else works the way we do, from what I can tell. If you're a freelance writer for magazines and so forth... every third person in Brooklyn works the way you do. (That's one reason I never tried to be one, tempting though it was; I'm probably better suited for journalism than grad school, but here I am). If you're trying to be a freelancer, the competition is, to my mind, insanely fierce.",1284739898

Currently, if I want to use some Microsoft technology i'm forced in to the rest of the ecosystem and that's a hurdle that i'll likely never jump unless there is simply no other option.<p>In some respects, Microsoft is already at a disadvantage over Free and Open Source technology when starting new projects without legacy issues, just from the simplification of licensing and the supplier diversification. To add extra barriers, such as having to take on larger and larger parts of the Microsoft ecosystem to get the best out of one component just makes things worse.<p>Positive first step would be once and for all unequivocally clear up any IP issues surrounding both Mono and their library reimplementations to silence any critics. Second would be bringing Mono in to the .NET ecosystem as a first class citizen. I like C# and .NET but i'm highly unlikely to use it unless I have some real choices for deploying it. From what i've seen from Mono, it's an impressive project but not yet on par with Hotspot and the CLR.<p>On a site note, there have been some positive steps. The move to Apache 2.0 licensing on several recent contributions is a positive step and helps prevent more license proliferation.<p>Essentially, I want Microsoft to compete for my business with technology that I can deploy without the worry that i'm perennially locked in to one ecosystem and one vendor.",1284739756

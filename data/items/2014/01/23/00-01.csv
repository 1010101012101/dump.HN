There is no universal ordering of events, there is a substantial degree of relativity to ordering of events that are separated by great distances. And, in fact, the only hard boundaries on this ordering are the &quot;light cones&quot; connecting events. In one reference frame the M82 supernova could have happened 12 million years ago, in another reference frame it could have happened a year ago, or two years ago, or even 20 million years ago. In the reference frame of any neutrinos that happened to have been created in the supernova it would have occurred mere seconds or hours before the first light reached Earth.",1390438647

Yes, you&#x27;ll get spammed and you will never get off those spam lists but none the less, it has all worked out for me.<p>Some things from my experiences:<p>1. 99% won&#x27;t read your resume and just auto mail you anything that matches a keyword in your resume. Just auto delete or block those companies<p>2. Only talk to recruiters who actually call you. They tend to actually have more valuable jobs. But there will be lots of spam here too<p>3. Recruiters will bring you jobs which you can&#x27;t get on your own. They have priority access and many positions fill before they ever hit the boards. If you are just applying by yourself, you won&#x27;t see 50% of what&#x27;s actually out there<p>4. You can bargain with recruiters. If you are hourly and you stand your ground, you can often push the rate higher. A recruiter will rather fill a position through his company than make a few extra dollars. Filling positions gives them return business, that pays loads in the long term for them so they are motivated to negotiate<p>5. They are often aware of positions other than what you are interviewing for. If you are interested in a different role within the same company, they can talk directly to the hiring manager about a role which is in the works<p>6. Beware the hierarchy of recruitment companies. You always want to be talking to the primary org, not a subcontractor to the primary..or worse. Rates get worse the further you get from the primary recruitment company which actually holds the contract with the client",1390437177

Or, in this instance, Southwest.<p>Some of the travel sites using ITA&#x27;s QPX API to drive their booking engine get prices from these other airlines via direct feeds or web scraping, but as pointed out here, they can be quite selective in what they&#x27;re willing or able to show<p>It&#x27;s still ludicrously easy to trip up the flight comparison services up with edge cases like the short domestic Yangon-Mandalay route, where ITA finds nothing, most booking engines offer ridiculously expensive flights connecting in China or Bangkok, whilst Innovata Quicktrip (which you should use when you&#x27;re convinced there are direct flights the big sites <i>aren&#x27;t</i> showing you) shows multiple direct flights a day with 6 different local airlines, provided you don&#x27;t mind their clumsy twentieth century booking operations.<p>TLDR: Use Quicktrip (which doesn&#x27;t give direct prices) to check if there are budget airlines or local airlines also flying on direct routes that the big search sites might not be showing, and try these unlisted airlines&#x27; websites direct if they seem more promising.",1390435821

You&#x27;re right that if you were a career developer who went back to school then I would be out of line. Fortunately, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.<p>> I starting learning computer programming while being in middle school<p>You, me, and half of the other CS students with whom I attended college. Unless you&#x27;re a Peter Deutsch-class wunderkind it probably doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference. When I look at some of the horrifying trial-and-error code (<a href=""https://gist.github.com/briangordon/8569048"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/briangordon/8569048</a>) I wrote back then, it&#x27;s hard to imagine how that experience helped me the slightest bit- and I&#x27;ve heard other people say the exact same thing. I too wrote a lot of PHP 5(.0) and did some basic CRUD stuff with MySQL - and made some cool things happen - but realistically I don&#x27;t think that experience would be much of an advantage if I were to do that kind of thing today. It&#x27;s <i>really</i> easy to pick up a new imperative language like PHP. Any developer with the same knowledge of fundamentals could just work off the documentation and do approximately as well as me. And no interviewer looking for PHP expertise is going to be impressed if I get called in for a PHP developer interview because I had it on my resume and all I can do is mumble something about superglobals and variables start with a dollar sign and how mysql_escape_string is deprecated. Sure there are many employers who don&#x27;t care if you know their codebase&#x27;s language coming in, but then those people don&#x27;t care that you have that particular language on your resume in the first place.<p>> I am sorry if &quot;I wasted your time&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not what I meant; I meant that you&#x27;d be wasting interviewers&#x27; time. I&#x27;ve performed screening interviews a couple of times and I was consistently frustrated over and over again by candidates who put some technology on their resume but couldn&#x27;t answer basic questions when put on the spot. The whole point of having something on your resume is to show that you can bring expertise to the table, not as some kind of trophy case of tech that you&#x27;ve used in the past. The bottom line is that if your level of experience on some subject can be acquired in a 40-hour week, then there is no material reason for the employer to hire you over someone with no experience on that subject.<p>> C/C++: I wrote tens of thousands lines while writing UNIX and video games team projects. PHP: Thousands lines for various projects, personal website, URL shortener engine, blog engine for friends... Objective-c: During my first year internship I wrote and published 2 iOS app on the Apple Store. While I had no previous experience with such a language, this may show you that I am a quick learner.<p>I&#x27;ve written maybe ten thousand of lines of C++ but I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my resume at the same level as my primary experience. Expertise is something different from being able to cobble together a working program. When integrating with other people&#x27;s code it&#x27;s super important to read and write idiomatic code for the language. I do not have that level of expertise in C++- in fact, I have a copy of the C++ standard and it terrifies me. Even cdecls scare me a little sometimes.<p>But whereas I&#x27;m drowning in Stroustrup, I&#x27;m swimming like a happy fish in the JLS. In that domain, I&#x27;m eager to attack any question you can throw at me. <i>That&#x27;s</i> the meaning of putting something on your resume, in my opinion. If you&#x27;re resorting to the argument of:<p>> this may show you that I am a quick learner<p>then that stuff is better relegated to an &quot;other experience&quot; footnote which is just a link to your dazzling GitHub page.<p>> Maybe you are too much used to regular student taking standard classes at university, but my university EPITECH is way different from any classical university. EPITECH is a software engineering school. With its unique pedagogical approach, we (students) have dozens of projects (about 60 technical projects just for the 2 first years). This is a type of participatory learning that allows us to unleash our creativity through project-based learning. It&#x27;s an atypical university, instead of regular lectures we have technical/practical projects to work on, all along the years to learn by ourselves.<p>That sounds really cool, and an interesting counterweight to the traditional math-heavy computer science curriculum. With that many projects I advise you against putting every tech you&#x27;ve ever worked with in a list on your resume. You could make a really impressive portfolio with all of those projects, and link to that. I had success getting my current job by putting a big link to a &quot;portfolio&quot; of undergrad side projects at the bottom of my resume under my actual experience.

Google, Netflix, myself (PortableApps.com), we all pay for bandwidth to host and serve videos, binary downloads, etc.  And then the home user is paying on their end.<p>But, ISPs charge their customers for &#x27;unlimited&#x27; bandwidth, a lie, and then have ghost caps, throttling, etc.  The only person being dishonest here is the ISP.  And having all the major content providers on-board with calling them out on throttling will keep them from doing it since it will 1. make their customers angry/consider switching and 2. cost them quite a bit in support hours.  So, they&#x27;ll be forced to switch to a more honest set of advertising, billing, and bandwidth counting based on individual usage.<p>Granted, we&#x27;ll still have to put up with their monopolies, lack of common carrier rules (so your home VOIP phone is offline for weeks and you can&#x27;t do anything about it), poor customer service, etc.  Realistically, we&#x27;ll need wireless to come up with better plans to force them to be competitive.

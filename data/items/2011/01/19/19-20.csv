For me, I knew that gymnastics was only something I could do for a short time in my youth and I wanted to go as far as possible with it. I had made the Junior National team at one point and competed in several USA Championships against all the big guys. I wanted do to whatever it took to succeed.<p>In terms of impressing people - that's never been a goal. I was greatly ridiculed as a kid for being a gymnast and even as it got a little more ""cool"" in high school and college, its got nothing on football or basketball. I did this for me - and for the coaches, teammmates and alumni at Stanford Gymnastics who were so dedicated to earning a victory.<p>It's the fact that we won as a team that means the most to me.

Happy, healthy, planning a couple ski trips.<p>As of January 18, 2011. Happy, healthy. $3,000 in medical debt.<p>It wasn't a really hard road to get from 0 to $3,000 in 3 weeks either. I currently work for one of the top 20 largest companies in the US. I have a United Healthcare PPO (the largest carrier in the country) and Delta Dental (also the largest dental carrier). So I don't work for some fly by night startup with an off brand insurance, this is blue-chip benefits at the most stable kind of job you can have.<p>I had previously scheduled my wisdom teeth to be removed, had them removed no problem. They paid 80%, I paid 20% plus the deductible. Total cost to me was $450 out of pocket. No big deal and expected.<p>Not a week later, couldn't breath, thought it was either an asthma attack or allergic reaction to something I just ate at a restaurent. Go to the hospital, its not either. After a cat-scan, x-ray, a couple hours with a GI and another doc I find out it is something completely different and previously unknown. Controllable, not a big deal, but the symptoms were quite scary.<p>Get the bill, $2,100. My insurance declines $1,900 worth of charges since it was an ""illness"" and they don't cover that in the ER unless you must stay overnight because they don't want people using the ER as their primary care physician (understandable). So apply my $500 deductible, and I'm on the hook for basically the whole thing. Call it $2,000. (this is pending appeal). Mind you, if they approved it they would have paid 90% and I would have paid my $500 deductible, so I should have sandbagged it and stayed overnight apparently (while running up twice the bill).<p>C) Had to get some additional dental surgery. After the last experience expected to pay 20%, but for whatever reason they only cover 50% (since it was damage to my gums from retainers as a child, which apparently is not their problem) and I'm on the hook for an additional $925.<p>Now, writing checks for $3,000 won't bankrupt me by any stretch. (mind you, I'm actually writing more like $4,000 but a bunch of it is fair and expected, the $3,000 is the amount above and beyond what I think I'm supposed to be paying). But it would for a lot of people. Even for me it sucks, I had planned to use that money for something more interesting than papering over the holes in my insurance policy.<p>I can completely understand how people end up in bankruptcy. In my opinion, if the plan says it will cover 80% and I have to cover 20%, with a deductible and a maximum out of pocket expense for me annually, then thats what should happen for non fraudulent charges. I went to the hospital for a good reason. All of the dental work has been recommended to me by a general dentist, seconded by an periodontist, and concurred by the oral surgeon who actually did it. None of this stuff is me running up unncessary bills. So I have the max out of pocket put aside in an account every year, and all of sudden my bills blow that by 4x because they are declining charges, and I'm sucking money out of my general emergency account, it sucks.<p>I can handle it, I'm glad I planned for emergencies and saved money and live within my means, but I can understand how this doesn't work for people living paycheck to paycheck and its not their fault. Not long ago I was getting by with the max out of pocket in an account, no emergency fund, and saying if shit happened I'd put it on my credit card while I pumped all my spare cash into paying down student loans. So I'm just lucky this is all happening Jan of 2011 and not Jan of 2010. And anytime you can make a statement like that, it is hard to blame the people where the dates didn't work out for them.",1295466840

2120991,comment,2120756,2120924,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't know much about MzScheme, but it's quite possible that ""thread"" means ""stack"", not ""OS thread"".  One context stack per TCP connection is quite sustainable; with Haskell's threads and Perl's coros, I run out of fds long before I'm using any significant amount of memory.  (This is somewhere around 30,000 open connections on my un-tweaked Linux desktop.  I know I can do a lot more if I tried.)<p>The issue, in the case of HN, is with O(n) IO watchers.  Most sockets are idle most of the time, so you really want an algorithm that is O(n) over <i>active</i> sockets, not O(n) over active and inactive sockets.  You typically have so few active fds at any time that the n is really tiny, making massively scalable network servers trivial to write.  But you also have a lot of connections at any one time, so if you are O(n) over active and inactive fds, then you are going to have performance issues.  Basically, you don't want to pay for connections that aren't doing anything.<p>Fortunately, we have the technology; epoll on Linux, kqueue on BSDs, /dev/poll on Solaris.  You just need to use an event loop, so it does all the hard stuff for you (and so you don't have to worry about the OS differences).  Hacking a proper event loop into MzScheme may be hard, but it's absolutely necessary for writing scalable network servers.  Handling 10k+ open connections is trivial with today's technology.  And, all the cool kids are doing it (node.js, GHC, etc.).",1295466524

I begged my parents to get us into therapy. We did and the therapy focused on why is insomniac so mentally ill. Insomniac (me) wasn't ill at all though. That's the point. Sometimes depression is the result of unrealistic expectations. For these the solution is CBT. But in other cases depression and  suicide are symptoms of things being seriously fucked up. They are not ""Mental illnesses"". There is no chemical imbalance. The myth of mental illness as an explanation for why abused people are unhappy has caused a lot of suffering. I am not saying that some people are not insane. I am saying that when 50% of the people are depressed in a psychotic, inconsistent, abusive, warmongering society where abuse and torture are virtues, it's not because of a brain imbalance. It wasn't until I was an adult that I saw what was going on. Now I see pretty clearly and am no longer depressed. But I am angry, and that anger is justified.

2120969,comment,2120805,2120805,0,0,geuis,,,"Its interesting that Alpha has the equation baked in. What would be more interesting would be to see a regularly updated version of this with the latest cosmological data coming in from telescopes like Kepler. Over the next 3-5 years, Kepler is going to be finding Earth-size planets that exist in their star's habitable zones.<p>For those not familiar with how Kepler is finding planets, I'll explain. Basically, Kepler looks for planets transiting in front of their stars. The telescope watches for dips in the star's light. If the planet has an atmosphere, in some cases it can even get an idea of some of the gases from the light.<p>The reason that astronomers aren't expecting to find Earth-size worlds in the habitable zones is that they have to wait for several transits to know for sure they've seen a planet. The reason that most of the planets found to date have been gas giants orbiting very close to their stars is that it only takes a few weeks or months for them to transit the star several times. Astronomers can see one transit, but have to wait for a 2nd to hypothesize a planet is found, and have to see a 3rd or more transit to verify the planet is real.<p>So Kepler has likely already detected suspected Earth-size planets in habitable zones around at least a few stars. However, the telescope has to watch for several years to confirm the transits. Imagine an astronomer in another solar system that has seen Earth transit the Sun. They would have to wait 3-4 years to see Earth transit the Sun several times to confirm our existence.<p>Edit: Meant to include this earlier. There are multiple ways to detect exoplanets, including the transit method. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_extrasolar_planets#Transit_method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_extrasolar...</a>",1295466300

Some thoughts on hackfinancing:<p>1) Set up an organization website, profile and all the relative legal structures prior to actually quitting your job.  Determine cap ex and operating costs upfront and use them as a barometer of short and long term financial viability -- don't forget to include your salary.  Identify all the costs that can be extended over the long term (for example, artificial turf that can be bought under letter of credit from the manufacturer).  This all does take quite a bit time and after the paychecks stop coming, the urgency to get the show on the road is on.  Save yourself much of this by starting now.<p>2) Develop a community of soccer enthusiasts by asking them to get on an e-mail list on your site and/or collect them out and about in different places.<p>3) Develop a community of businesses in your local community that would be interested in supporting your organization once you get off the ground.  Use a free CRM tool to keep track of your relationships and be relentless about setting up the ground work and pounding pavement early.  Do the same with family and friends.<p>4) Develop a program based around a specific operating season that invites team captains and corporate sponsors to buy into the league's founding year at X costs.  Use the team captains as your primary vehicle for driving the membership model for your initial run.  Promote shamelessly to corporate citizens with various contribution levels and use the organization's structure and initial interests to drive participation.<p>5) Take the participation metrics, financials, organization's structure to the equipment suppliers/manufacturers are request special financing terms that will allow you breathing room to lengthen your operating horizon given the special liquidity situation you're currently in. Pay hard cash for only the essentials necessary to keep the concept moving forward.  Take a similar approach and now approach your target locations with a sound proposal for renting the space, with allocations for build out (most available with property improvement assistance from the landlord if they have the resources).  Seek probono assistance from a commercial property managers interested in the project on how best to set this up and approach the landlords.  Do so ONLY after all the steps above are completed and documented to confirm how you intend to run the enterprise.<p>Additions:<p>Seek friends and family financial assistance for net difference by allowing them to become founding partners in the operation - granting options or stock (under the allowable limits as determined by the SEC).<p>Sell yearly ""pickup"" game passes for specific day of the week pickup games on a membership plan.<p>Host weekend day birthday games for kids (see how climbing centers do this really well). Sell 10 pack kids party tickets in advance to parents to build up cash.<p>Set up and host summer camps, sell passes early.",1295465639

Now each test executable contains code that is directly used by the test.<p>4) ensure that your build process only touches a statically linked test if a dependency has actually changed.  This comes for free most of the time, but you may still have the linker touching files that it doesn't have to.  You can remove these cases by staging the test files using a binary comparitor tool like rsync.  If you have a crappy linker, or there's something in your test executables which is always changing (like a build stamp) you might need to compare using more advanced tools (like binutils) or something like Google's Courgette.<p>5) Run your tests only when the test is newer than the results--that is, when test_a is newer than test_a_result.xml.  This is straightforward to implement using most build systems, like make, or using a test runner script.<p>Bam--now a test only runs if some dependent code has changed.  If your test also uses data, you should list it as a dependency in your build system--either manually or by detecting open() calls at runtime via a shim over libc, or via strace.  Your test run takes much less time, and, best of all, developers get a lot less spam to read through.

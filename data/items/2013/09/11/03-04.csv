The civil wars, rape, and poisoning are all symptoms of a deeper illness: poverty. Africans aren&#x27;t more corrupt or warlike than anyone else, they&#x27;re just poorer and therefore more desperate.<p>Conflict minerals (diamonds, coltan, etc) fuel conflict because they are easy to control. It only takes a relatively few men to control a mine, and any diamonds mined can easily be exported. In contrast, an aquifer is hard to control: each liter of water isn&#x27;t worth that much, and Kenya doesn&#x27;t have the infrastructure to export water anyway.<p>The water won&#x27;t really be a target for militia, but it will be able to be used to develop the region. More water gives more crops, which gives higher living standards, which gives less war.<p>(As a side note, another potential benefit is that this aquifer will promote regional integration, since it&#x27;s on the border between South Sudan and Kenya. South Sudan is in the process of applying for membership in the East African Community, which has the stated goal of eventually transforming into a political federation.

They didn’t have the credentials to pull 50 ‘good’ countries from 100 uncategorised ones, so they used us to push the responsibility away. ‘It’s not me saying Bolivia is an 8.2,’ they could tell their boss. ‘A human rights NGO said it was. Making shoes there is totally approved.</i><p>What else would you expect the corporation to do?  Eventually, someone in that organization has to make a decision, and that requires the complex information about countries&#x27; human rights situations to be summarized in a simpler way -- for which a ranking is one approach.<p>It sounds like they wanted the NGO to do this summarization.  If the NGO didn&#x27;t do it, then they&#x27;d get someone else or from within their organization to do it.<p>Something like rankings are inevitable.  They fulfill a huge information need.  The fact there are lots of poorly done rankings out there won&#x27;t change that.

Obviously, if you sell to the government, it&#x27;ll be easier if you follow the NIST standards. There are likely lots of other compliance related reasons you would want to, such as encryption requirements for HIPAA. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some of those standards either required or were easier to comply with if you just used NIST approved algorithms, and it&#x27;s easiest to use those NIST algorithms systemwide if the OS CSPRNG uses them (and directly, without extra unapproved random number generation on top).<p>> Second: Dual EC DRBG is a CSPRNG that uses elliptic curve point multiplications; in other words, it requires bignum math. If you&#x27;re unfamiliar with CSPRNG design: that&#x27;s not a normal requirement. Dual EC is very slow. Nobody would willingly use it.<p>Yes, this is the odd part. On the other hand, you do have to recall that the NSA is a big government bureaucracy. It may be that their SIGINT enablement department (the one that&#x27;s responsible for weakening exportable crypto, planting backdoors, and the like) had promised to get some backdoors into widely used standards, but couldn&#x27;t find a better way to do so surreptitiously and effectively without weakening security against foreign attackers as well.<p>It may be that Dual EC DRBG was just inserted so they could check off a box and continue to get funding for the standards body division of SIGINT enablement, and not as an actually realistic attack.",1378871512

I know how to use those, just as I am sure many regular outlook users know how to use gmail and how many gmail users know how to use mutt.  My personal choice, while an unusual and eccentric choice, does not render me particularly incapable of being aware and familiar with other choices.  Furthermore, I consider myself perfectly capable of offering others advice.  If my mother asked me what client to use, I would tell her to stick with the gmail web app and phone app.  If a coworker asked me what they should use, I would recommend that they continue to use Outlook, unless I knew they were receptive to and interested in using mutt.  I really don&#x27;t see how using mutt could be impeding my ability to make sound mail client recommendations.<p>Using mutt to compose and read email does not make me out of touch and ignorant of Outlook anymore than using Windows Phone 8  makes somebody out of touch and ignorant of iOS.<p>Shoot, another example with some actual evidence:  I use a Chromebook with Debian on it.  I enjoy this setup immensely, but if you search through my comment history you will see that I am very critical of it when talking about it with others.  This is because, despite my eccentric setup, I am <i>not</i> out of touch with how most users use their computers, and with what most users expect from their computers.  I understand that the setup I enjoy is <i>not</i> for everybody.  In fact, rather few people would find it acceptable.",1378869858

So we ate some bread. Then we saw the onion bulbs we were supposed to plant. We ate them right then and there, with bread and salt. They were delicious. Time went by and the biologists asked us, ‘How are the onions?’\n “‘They are growing,’ we answered….\n “‘Do they have shoots?’ Without any hesitation we replied that they even had shoots. There was great excitement at the communication station. Onions have never bloomed in space before!

It&#x27;s hard to quantify anti-productivity, let along get anyone reviewing work to admit that anti-productivity has occurred. Our work culture tends to value activity over all else, so the common sentiment is that a warm butt in the chair is better than nothing, even if that warm butt is making more work for everyone else.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that my method will actually ameliorate much of this. By starting the person part-time, perhaps their familiarity with the project builds &quot;faster&quot; over a unit-work-time than it would otherwise (I&#x27;ve personally found my comfort level with a project to be in some part a function of calendar time). In this way, I&#x27;m also not spending a lot on the candidate search itself.<p>The idea is to spend less time on much-higher-yield methods of  finding people who are better suited to the job crossed with people who are happier with the environment of the job. It <i>is</i> about avoiding turn-over, but not in this perverse way of &quot;ignore the problem because the alternative is worse&quot;, but by trying to avoid the hiring of a bad worker in the first place.<p>In this system, you&#x27;ll never see a job notice from me. You won&#x27;t know I have a need for an employee unless I ask you to come work for/with me. You&#x27;ll only ever get a job offer from me if A) I know you&#x27;re not an idiot, and B) I know you&#x27;re available. Yes, that means I have to know the person very well already. If I have an opening that needs to be filled and I don&#x27;t currently know of someone that fills it, then it is likely to be a long time before it gets filled, if I do nothing.<p>But then again, it&#x27;s not like sifting through resumes is providing quality applicants. The resume and job interview are so poor of a selection process that I&#x27;m willing to try just about anything else.<p>There is also an element of respect for the worker involved in what I&#x27;m doing. I don&#x27;t think I have a right to monopolize a person&#x27;s time. I think people should have the time to be engaged in many pursuits. I want it to be up to them to choose how much they work. I want them to have the ability to find other work as well. The idea being, people who are happier in their work-life balance will be more productive.<p>Of course, we&#x27;ll see.",1378869195

I&#x27;m just going to paste my favorite statement from the internet loved Judge Posner.<p>&quot;A distinguishing characteristic of intellectual property is its &quot;public good&quot; aspect. While the cost of creating a work subject to copyright protection—for example, a book, movie, song, ballet, lithograph, map, business directory, or computer software program—is often high, the cost of reproducing the work, whether by the creator or by those to whom he has made it available, is often low. And once copies are available to others, it is often inexpensive for these users to make additional copies. If the copies made by the creator of the work are priced at or close to marginal cost, others may be discouraged from making copies, but the creator’s total revenues may not be sufficient to cover the cost of creating the work. Copyright protection—the right of the copyright’s owner to prevent others from making copies—trades off the costs of limiting access to a work against the benefits of providing incentives to create the work in the first place. Striking the correct balance between access and incentives is the central problem in copyright law. For copyright law to promote economic efficiency, its principal legal doctrines must, at least approximately, maximize the benefits from creating additional works minus both the losses from limiting access and the costs of administering copyright protection.&quot;<p><a href=""http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/IPCoop/89land1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/IPCoop/89land1.html</a>",1378869172

This is unfortunately very common in anything nutrition or health based, but often applies to scientific &quot;breakthroughs&quot; as well. The media picks up some vague research result and hyping it to make headlines.<p>I just really hope this is not the case here, because it&#x27;s truly good news for a dry region where water means everything.<p>This, along with the large recent oil and natural gas discoveries kind of makes me wonder how many such additional surprises the earth crust hides, that will be discovered soon due to much better discovery technologies and computational resources.",1378868752

Everyone knows this situation exists for the immediate drama and for the ramifications further on in the story, not because it&#x27;s in the least bit plausible (let alone necessary). In the future they couldn&#x27;t have had a robot deliver the package? Maybe just drop it in with a timer on board?

Maybe once upon a time it was meant to have something to say about our future, but now any reasonable extrapolation would lose the essential character of the property. Hell, maybe Star Trek has never been about the future anyway. I&#x27;m sure everyone caught the bit about the morality and legality of extrajudicial killing in the new flick...

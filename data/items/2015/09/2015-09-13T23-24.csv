</code></pre>
That&#x27;s what I mean when I say it misses the mark. There are now two ways of doing the same thing and one of them is more powerful than the other. Using generators I can use both `yield` and `yield from` but if I use what they&#x27;re calling co-routines then I can only use `yield from`. I see no value in the new syntax.<p>So an async function is not really a co-routine. It is a regular function that gets to use `await` and that&#x27;s it. Calling it a co-routine is misleading and confusing.",1442188164

It&#x27;s a really good point too. Thank you for sharing.<p>This is certainly true in SV and many other cities. However, top tier companies are criticized for not discovering and attracting qualified minority candidates. I want these candidates to have a shot at the best jobs. Going back to our original conversation about referrals. A referred candidate gets preferential treatment. If a company is entirely homogenous then few minority candidates will benefit.<p>On the other hand, I have noticed that underrepresented candidate are already treated better. Of course there might still be biases and other things against them but that&#x27;s not what we set out to discuss. Yes, the pipeline is a large problem. Retention is too. I think there are many things our society should fix.<p>The EEOC example is an extra incentive for companies to try harder to expand their candidate pool.

And I still continue to find stuff I hate about systemd. The latest was just yesterday, while troubleshooting some disk issues I wanted to fsck root before rebooting. Which normally means just remount root as read-only. Tried that and it didn&#x27;t work, &quot;disk was busy&quot;. Jumped into runlevel 1, still disk was busy. Rebooted into rescue mode, remount ro, still disk busy. After googling and digging through lsof, I could see it was systemd processes and journal that was holding onto files and preventing a remount. Tried killing systemd, journald, even kill -9, it just restarts it self and holds the disk. Darn. Did the touch /forcefsck trick, rebooted, yet no fsck. Darn again. More googling later, I see you have pass kernel parameters at boot time to force a fsck, and no, you can&#x27;t select which FS either, it just does all of them. Rebooted again, fsck is running of course. I just wanted root checked but now it is doing all my terabyte partitions as well.

All in the cloud + browser (or another client). So a phone just needs a browser. [see my other reply]<p>I missed the Barrister IDL-JSON binding... kinda important! I must check how they bind choice/sum/polymorphism to JSON...<p>2) JSON by example schema: Thanks! It&#x27;s never been used; the above comment is the only documentation. Maybe I should write a RFC... or at least first draft of a spec. And a reference implementation.<p>Actually using this schema to validate JSON instances requires using all the fields to determine which branch you have. They can have fields with the same name, provided the entire set is distinct. So these are OK (letters as fieldnames):<p><pre><code>  {a,x}+{a,y}; {a,b}+{a}; {a}+{} (empty object)   
</code></pre>
Thinking further, duplicate fields implies a different data model, and most JSON parsers will use a hash. Maybe it would ease adoption to fake up a syntax (eg addr-1, addr-2, addr-3 for the &quot;same&quot; field, with escaping rules for &#x27;-&#x27;). I wonder wonder about usage: maybe apps don&#x27;t use this approach (same field can have different kinds/types of values); maybe they use a field for each type, only having a value for one of them? (or an explicit &quot;type&quot; field). It&#x27;s important to model common practice.<p>But I think JS coders do use polymorphic behaviour (same method names with different code).<p>3) Add more primitve types.  Thinking further, although people end up wanting more precise primitive types for storing data, if JSON is mainly used for transferring values between languages, it really need only be as expressive as the languages themselves, which generally don&#x27;t go into details like syntactic nature of primitive values and ranges of integers and lists etc. (They wrap these concepts in objects; JSON can too).<p>I&#x27;m stepping back from the idea - I just liked that you could add richer types without losing the property of looking like JSON - but you do lose the property of representing types with the types of JSON values. Can leave the extra sophistication to xml schema (and json schema) for those who need it. Unless JSON itself add more primitive types (which I doubt!).<p>PS: one more comment to go.

That happens in every project. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the binary logging, for example. But that&#x27;s just an example. I much prefer systemd&#x27;s infrastructure for starting services over traditional init, and I think that&#x27;s a much bigger design decision.<p>> Yeah, I&#x27;ve had some personality issues with some of the maintainers, but that&#x27;s about how you handle bug reports and accept blame (or not) for when things go wrong.

When I managed to &quot;fix&quot; it, it worked superficially but displayed &quot;Segmentation fault&quot; at every boot [it still does that on another one of my machines, which in fairness never &quot;broke&quot;.].  This in addition to boot-time fsck breaking and my bluetooth audio and keyboard setup no longer working.  Based on this I am not inclined to think of Mr. Poettering as an &quot;it just works&quot; kinda guy.  On a related note I have never successfully gotten pulse audio to perform its intended function of playing audio samples.<p>After ~15 years of mostly tracking Debian sid on my personal machine, I switched to FreeBSD on my laptop when seeing these issues.

But that&#x27;s not quite the same as someone being able to put the story into context of today&#x27;s technology and status quo. Ideally the history lesson comes from someone with knowledge of SMF from many angles.<p>For instance Bryan Cantrill (full disclosure I worked for/with Bryan while at Joyent) was at Sun for the development of SMF, he&#x27;s had experience using SMF in production, and more recently from his LX Brand work he&#x27;s been exposed to the facilities that Linux has created to deal with the same sorts of issues.<p>Bryan is a superior technologist and a hell of a story teller, I&#x27;m sure I would enjoy reading/hearing his telling of why things like libproc and contracts were created and how they evolved over time, and if that as any relationship to why SMF is designed and behaves the way it does.<p>Note, Bryan is just an example -- there are many other people in the community that were there and could tell the stories. He&#x27;s just the first person I thought of.<p>The point is that [re]creating interfaces/subsystems is ok, so long as we do that with the full view of history, such that we avoid that repeating cliche.<p>(I prefer run on sentences)",1442185976

A few things drove me nuts at first, trying to figure out why syntax that worked in Python2 is not longer working in Python3.
But a little bit of googling and I was on my way with Python3.<p>I have a project that I started a long time ago in Python2 using web.py.
I tried to migrate to Python3, but unfortunately, web.py is not supported.
I know Flask has python3 support and I could migrate to that but I&#x27;m not ready to move my whole code base over yet.<p>From someone who tried to migrate to Python3 with no compelling reason to, hit a roadblock, I immediately shelved the problem till later as I&#x27;m not missing anything critical from Python3 to warrant the effort.<p>I wonder how many other projects go through this?

And quite frankly, if they can't control themselves in the starve-binge cycle, which probably contributes significantly to the lack of food money, and can't tell that something harming them is harming them, then any evolutionary standpoint sort of demands they stay there.  Meanwhile, those typically-poorest locations are most heavily targeted for food kitchens and support money, but many are too proud to take help that's offered.<p>And, if there's not a portion of stupidity, how do some get out of poverty?

Apple is doing that with the iPad, and they still have, and will continue to have, a lead position in the smart phone market letting them have some influence over where that industry is headed, especially with things like the App store and their market penetration.  But how much time and effort is it worth looking back at previous industries they've upset while they upset the next industry?

1191265,comment,1190884,1190884,0,0,dkarl,,,"It would be interesting to know how many groups or classes of people have bridged the gap from insecurity to plenty <i>without</i> experiencing an obesity problem.  Even Japan is struggling with a rise in obesity.  Remember when the rich were all plump, and gout was a rich person's disease?  Upper-class culture evolved to deal with the problem, but it didn't happen overnight.  This looks like an instance where the upper classes took a few generations to adapt, but now we're looking at the poor (and also the middle class) and saying <i>why don't you just catch the fuck up right now?</i>  Obviously people arriving at the problem later have more information to work with, but cultural change is hard.  Give 'em a generation or two.<p>This article concentrates on the availability of food, but I think that's only one side of the problem.  I remember an NPR segment a couple of years ago where they went to a food bank near a wealthy area and compared what people were donating to what people were taking from the food bank.  The rich folks were donating whole-wheat bread, which ended up just sitting on the shelves.  Either the poor folks didn't know what to do with it, or felt insulted that the rich folks were trying to change their eating habits, or they just didn't like it.  The poor folks wanted white bread and canned vegetables.  Just because you've got whole-grain bread and fresh vegetables doesn't mean you know what to do with them or how to get your kids to eat them.  Better supply might help, though:  provide healthy food, and maybe they'll figure out what to do with it, even if they didn't really want it in the first place.<p>Getting kids raised on junk to start eating healthy food is another problem:  I don't have kids myself, but evidently kids are little nutritional self-harm monsters.  If you give healthy food to a kid who is used to pizza rolls and potato chips, he won't eat it, and he'll get cranky and nasty because he hasn't eaten.  He'll torture himself and everyone around him until he gets candy or a Coke or mac and cheese.  If you've let your kids get accustomed to eating junk, there's going to be a hell of a lot of suffering -- for both parents and kids -- before healthy eating starts to feel normal.  Maybe that's why the adjustment time is measured in generations.<p>Personally, my parents had some crude notion of healthy eating, so I didn't get soda, candy, or sugary cereal, but we ate a lot of pancakes, french toast, spaghetti, bread and butter, bacon, buttery popcorn, etc.  Those are foods that it's easy to gorge on, quantities were not consistently limited, and I liked eating, so I ate way too much.  My parents maintained discipline and knew it was important that I ate a healthy diet; they just didn't have a good enough understanding of nutrition.  Hopefully with my own kids I'll maintain what they achieved and add a better understanding of nutrition.",1268599149

But not as worth it as hard-core advocates of FP like to think.<p>There is really only one difference between FP and traditional imperative programming (which I'll call IP).  In IP you have direct control over where the results of computations are stored and in FP you don't.  This is, of course, a two-edged sword.  Control gives you both power and the ability to screw things up.  Lack of control makes it easier for your compiler to perform certain kinds of optimizations.<p>The reason learning FP is worthwhile is not so much because FP is some kind of magic bullet, but because understanding the tradeoffs between having this kind of control and not having it is worthwhile in and of itself.  If you understand those tradeoffs you will write better code in whatever language you use, even if it's assembler.",1268598737

Thus it's not such a big problem (and the cool thing about using map & family is that you can replace them with parallel versions quite easily). With that said, some practical functional languages provide sugar to write seemingly imperative loops.<p>In terms of libraries, at least Scala, Clojure, F#, CAL, Nemerle (amongst others) ingrate well with either the JVM and/or the .Net platform. You can implement Erlang nodes in any JVM language (which I grant is not as good as calling directly into the JVM from an Erlang function).<p>There are definitely advantages to writing as much of your code as possible to avoid side effects (obviously ignoring the odd print statement to help with debugging), since your code becomes easy to test and easy to reason about. But in real world apps you will need state management - Clojure and Scala both allow this (in different ways) and I'm sure that F# does too (though I've never worked with F#).<p>I think that these three languages address many (all?) of your concerns. They all have cool user communities, so give one of them a shot.",1268597543

In Haskell, I half-seriously joke that ""it compiles, it must be correct"".<p>Also, modern functional languages have great library support.  For instance, Haskell has a variety of libraries available, and a great FFI to C that lets you talk to any available C library.  (I consider an FFI a necessary part of any generally useful language.)<p>And finally, ""implement a multi-level loop using recursion in ML"" sounds like a learning exercise, not a useful programming technique.  If your code tries to recreate constructs like multi-level loops, you've done something wrong; most of your code shouldn't even need explicit recursion.  Don't try to write one language's code in another language, and especially don't try to emulate an imperative language in a functional language.  Learn how to do things the right way in the new language.  If you try to write Java in Haskell, you'll find that it feels a lot harder than writing Java in Java, shockingly. :)<p>You've learned to think imperatively.  Functional programming requires a different approach.  It took me a long time to learn to think in Haskell, but now I feel quite comfortable with it.  Having watched and helped non-programmers learn to work with imperative programming, I know that doing so requires some hard leaps as well.  (""Wait, x = 5?

This type of code is frequently not very modular and hard to maintain. A functional programming language makes it hard to think like this, and IMHO that's a good thing.",1268597218

The other point is that there are pure OO languages, pure functional languages, pure logic languages, pure imperative languages, and rarely is a problem easily and comfortably expressed entirely in one pure paradigm.<p>But learning, properly learning a functional language gives you more experience, more ways of thinking, more techniques, more options.<p>But remember:<p><pre><code>  ""The dedicated real programmer can write

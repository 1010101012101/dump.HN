After some quick research, I settled down at Google Picasa Web, the price was very affordable ($5/year can buy you 20GB). It also has a nifty utility called Picasa Uploader, which can access pictures from my iPhoto library and upload to the Picasa Web.<p>Everything looked like the way it should be and I was very happy. Until I hit the wall -- there is a limit that one album on PicasaWeb can only contain maximum 1000 pictures.  This is very annoying (I should have been aware of this 'flaw' during my research, oh well). Say, I have some 2700 pictures in the 2006 folder (the smart folder in iPhoto, very handy feature anyway), in order to work around the limit, I had to create three albums on PicasaWeb, and make a local temp folder to split the pictures into 3 parts, 900ish each; then, fire up the Uploader to work each folder at a time. That's a pain.<p>And the uploading was very slow...<p>I feel sorry for Google Picasa Web, it does have lots of potentials and look like the solution for online photo backup.",1303566749

2476775,comment,2475854,2475854,5,0,jonnathanson,,,"Very funny and enlightening analysis. I've seen the fringes of algorithmic pricing a few times in other categories -- especially out-of-print DVDs or VHS tapes.<p>Example: don't ask me why I enjoy the movie My Dinner With Andre, but for whatever reason, I do. A few years back, I wanted to buy a copy of the DVD and checked Amazon. It turned out that the DVD was long out of print, and new copies were going for $400 apiece. I figured this price was high, but nevertheless, it was nothing that couldn't be explained by <i>actual</i> rarity and supply/demand metrics. Rare DVDs have been known to climb into the hundreds of dollars, especially if new and unopened. But I came back a few days later, and the price was $1932.78 (or something unusual to that effect). The next day, $3500 and change. Which struck me as odd, to say the least. Was some nefarious Goldman trader attempting to fix the market for Wallace Shawn's back catalog?<p>Needless to say, I didn't love the movie quite that much. So I passed. These days, Criterion has released a new DVD version of the film, and accordingly, everything's dropped back down to about $30 per copy -- including the price of the original, OOP version. I feel sorry for anyone who actually might have taken the plunge at $400, which is not out of the realm of possibility. That's a lot of money for a film about two guys having dinner.",1303565020

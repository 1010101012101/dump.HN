Honestly, it's always unsettled me a little that any software can just start arbitrarily scribbling bits to the hard drive. (The system folder is protected, but my data isn't.) The concern is only a little about malware, and mostly about buggy code.<p>All the sandbox requires is that apps only have access to files when the user initiates the action. And unlike most App Store policies, you're also allowed to request specific exceptions as needed by your app, and I'm expecting they'll actually be reasonable about it. [1] This creates more work for developers, but I think overall these changes will help keep users' data safe.<p>As also mentioned in this thread, these changes have big implications for inter-app communication. But sandboxing doesn't take the capability away; it just requires devs to do more work, again in the name of user security. There will be a big usability hit on apps which don't see regular updates, and apps whose developers neglect to update this aspect of their apps. But the same capabilities will exist, and eventually most apps will catch up to the new norms.<p>[1] Although if Apple starts making stupid rejections and standing by them, then I take it all back.",1320292736

They somehow bring up an eerie image in my head of someone holding their spouse hostage in the basement for lightly mentioning that they wanted to take a photography class.  ""No, dear, you're not allowed to be anything besides what you were the day I met you.  Change is not in the cards for you, unless I make those changes"".  Creepy.<p>That overbearing spouse deserves to be left in the dust immediately, and maybe some of these old users do as well.  Not that they would be truly left behind, considering the vast landscape of other equally expensive options available requiring just as much effort to install - or MORE, if that's your thing.<p>We've been talking about bringing Linux to the desktop for more than a decade.  And it's not even close.  So a company comes along and says: Listenting to you guys isn't working, so we're going to try something else.  And now they're somehow considered the antithesis to Linux.  What is ""Bringing Linux to the masses"" supposed to mean?  Making all computer users around the world cantakerous curmudgeons who can change every pixel any graphical interface can ever hope to offer?  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't like that world.  I like Linux geeks, and consider myself one, but I also like all the people in my life who will never even care what Linux is.<p>And maybe there is a way to the masses via the old ways.  I implore you to invest your time and money to find out.  I would honestly love to watch that unfold, and I'd probably install that version as well to see if it fits me.  In the meantime, I'm going to be happily using Ubuntu everywhere, as I am now - on my 2 year old DIY desktop with 2 giant 27"" monitors (worked upon first install, with no proprietary drivers - 3 screens: not so easy), on my television (DIY home theater running xbmc - hdmi audio and video - also worked upon first install - no proprietary), and on my laptop at work (thinkpad, also worked immediately), and of course, on a couple servers at various stages of deploy.<p>As unpopular as the opinion may be around here, I really enjoy using Unity.  It's new and obviously imperfect, but it's one of the better user experiences I've found on Linux.  I felt the old gnome 2 desktop was a step back from Windows 7 when I switched my media center to it last year.  It looked as though I was installing software from 15 years in the past, trying to fit into a world that had an inch of dust on top of it.<p>I like the windows-7-like dock bar in Unity.  I like that searching for apps via keyboard is king (although the sorting sucks, sorting by usage is essential).  Not a huge fan of the omni-preset menu bar, but it's not really THAT big of a deal (admittedly having 2 giant screens makes that possible).  I don't give a damn about screensavers, as I haven't used one since flying toasters were the in thing.  Truth be told, I spend far too much making things ON Linux to care much about Linux itself.  And that's the way it should be.  At least that's the only way I can stand to use Linux on every single computer I own.",1320292458

According to me, Gnome 2.3 is by far the best designed UX for a desktop operating system. Like most people, I generalize based on my own limited experience, and I have seen people grow up and learn how to use a computer in Gnome who were disgusted by Windows and OSX user interfaces. Like all animals, humans can be conditioned and there's simply no such thing as ""best UX for all"".<p>Lets look at Alt+Tab functionality, which now in Unity (and Gnome3) switches between ""apps"" instead of windows. The problem with Unity/Gnome3 is that they're doing <i>exactly</i> what Shuttleworth claims to avoid. Quoting Mark:<p><pre><code>  > we're not that interested in matching functionality\n  > that was in Win95, especially if we think that \n  > functionality will get dropped in Windows 8 or 9 or 10.\n</code></pre>\nUnity (and Gnome3) are both busy copying obsolete UI concepts from OSX, which itself is stuck in the 80s. I would say that they'd be better off copying Win95 instead, at least Microsoft recognized (correctly) back then that a concept of an ""app"" makes no sense on a modern desktop, and <i>windows</i> is what users want to manage, not ""apps"".<p>Mr. Shuttleworth admits to be heavily influenced by Android and iOS. That's weird to me, since desktops are ultimately very different beasts. The concept of an ""app"" came back from the grave only because the 1st generation of mobile devices were very weak, DOS-like if you will, at multi-tasking and IPC. So... Mr. Shuttleworth picked the wrong corpse to invigorate.<p>In their mindless pursuit of copying everything from OSX they didn't even bother recognizing OSX own bugs like broken virtual desktops. See, Apple themselves failed to copy them properly from Unix UIs (windows from different desktops in OSX are mistakenly combined in the same useless giant Alt+tab list). But the thing about Apple, though, is that they can afford to have an obsolete window management circa 1985 because their windows are shiny and fly around without lag, while Unity just recently learned how to scroll text smoothly.<p>In the end, Mr. Shuttleworth really shouldn't mention Win95 at all, which now seems to emerge as a clearly superior desktop UX of all 3, nearly 20 years after its introduction.",1320292208

3190141,comment,3187350,3190069,1,0,xenophanes,,,"Oh, I see what you mean about <i>fixed</i>. It's hard to generalize about all data-dependent stopping rules. I do think the one that says ""If I get one conclusion, stop. If I get the other, keep trying,"" has got to be a bad idea! It prevents you from possibly finishing an experiment that concludes you're wrong. The possibility of not terminating seems especially problematic. But if the rule was more like ""Roll 10 dice. If at least one came up 6, roll one more die."" then it might be harmless and just complicate analyzing the results.<p>I think that even if you get the same data set as your results, as in the linked doctor example, the stopping rule does matter. A reason for this is that it affects the repeatability of experiments. Experiments ought to be repeatable (within margins of error, and using all the same procedures including stopping rules). Let's consider what could happen with repeat trials. Suppose the medicine almost but not quite works according to the standard you're trying to test for that will make the medicine considered a success (cures at least 60 out of 100 people, on average -- not the most realistic standard, but that's not important). Also suppose the data set had 60 cures exactly, not 70 (the following is technically possible, but unlikely, with 70).<p>So, the first experiment with a fixed N=100 will not be repeatable. Slightly too few people will be cured in future trials. The success on the first attempt was good luck within the margin for error (the real average cure rate is 59 out of 100).<p>The second experiment, however, will eventually report that the medicine works on at least 60% of patients on average in all 10 (or whatever) repeat trials, even though this is false. (I think. Maybe they won't make that false ""on average"" claim but will conclude something different instead? What?) The reason this will happen is basically the same reason that if you flip a coin enough you random walk away from the average (and eventually visit both sides of the average). And because the real cure proportion is so near the goal, there's a pretty good chance you could do a lot of repeat trials without any stalling out for years (which might clue some people in to the problem, though if they strictly ignore data from studies that haven't stopped yet, then maybe it wouldn't).<p>Similarly, imagine a study of coins which had a stopping rule to stop whenever you have at least 60% heads. You'll always be able to get that result and conclude the coin is biased, even if all coins used are fair. You'll often be able to get that result pretty quickly (and actually if you don't get it quickly, but hover around average, the expected time to get it will keep getting worse. But I bet we could come up with an example that doesn't have that property. Or we could consider 20 research groups, 15 of which report coins are biased and 5 of which never publish.). But the point is their result, claiming coins are biased, may be wrong. Even the possibility of the method getting a wrong answer, without anyone having made a mistake in doing it, is a major problem!<p>If someone said, ""Never mind their stopping rules, I want to salvage their coin flipping data and use it for my other project"" I think they would have a serious problem because it's not a proper random set of coin flip data but is instead limited to various possible sequences of flips and not others.<p>Now it could always be that trials with bad stopping rules get lucky and are correct, and using or believing their data won't work out badly. Their data set could <i>happen to be</i> identical to one that is properly collected. But I think one always has to fear the possibility that they didn't get lucky and their stopping conditions have spoiled the data (especially when you don't have a properly done trial with identical results to compare with) just as the people trying to prove coins are biased could easily spoil their data using <i>fixed</i> but unreasonable stopping conditions.",1320291945

I used it primarily as sharing tool, and the new sharing makes that more difficult. I think two fixes would make this better:<p>1) Being able to share easily with different circles. While I might be okay sharing publicly something interesting, there are plenty of less-than-appropriate funny articles that I only want to share with a few friends. This is one of the strengths of Google+, and it'd be great if Reader could take advantage of this.<p>2) Being able to see shared articles from other people. I understand they want to increase traffic to Google+, but this was always a great feature of Reader. In effect, each friend that used reader became their own feed. It'd be great to still have this feature and even though you're decreasing traffic to plus.google.com, you'd be increasing the overall use of Google+",1320291652

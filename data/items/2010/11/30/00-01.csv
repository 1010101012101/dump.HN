But that's not really the point.<p>The point is that AAPL is now only second to XOM in terms of market cap, and is not exactly a tiny blip on the radar. It is a stock that is being watched by literally millions. If these ""professional"" analysts have so many resources at their disposal, have the inside track on confidential information and are operating at such an uneven playing field as the parent postulates, then why would they consistently be beaten by the ""hobbyists""?",1291078751

They have the opposite problem in that they recently refused to continue to pay other ISP's in the country for the right to peer with them.

Sometimes these articles runs a risk of outsiders looking in without the essential industry experience needed to make truly sound judgements and suggestions. Its easy to point fingers and propose ideal solutions when you aren't in the classroom on a daily basis. My wife is in early childhood ed, my sister-in-law in elementary, and my mother-in-law in middle school and I still ""don't get it"" in the same way as they do.<p>Each of them admits that things are critically wrong with the system, and have proposed solutions to ones that I've read on HN.

It's like littering -- if you do it, it doesn't matter, but if everyone does it, then there's a major problem.  Liar loans and CDOs were like littering, not really a problem when one person or bank ""does"" them.

But it's just a colossal fuckup, not some super secret backroom deal designed to fuck over retirement funds.

They obviously were not, and people lost a lot of money either buying the CDOs, or selling insurance on the CDOs.)<p>The bailout was similarly non-evil.

Forgetting that code hasn't been optimized and speed is suffering, I just don't feel comfortable releasing a private beta yet.  Next BIG launch target is in January and I'll open up an extremely limited private alpha/guinea pig site in the meantime.<p>I'm of the opinion that it doesn't mater how many (or how few) features you have, or even if what you have works, but what is paramount is that the UX is perfect.

Economically it makes sense for C to hire them since together they create wealth, and the 700K that C gets to keep is a reward for his willingness to risk hiring them and managing them into a productive team etc.<p>If A and B would like the risk, they could start pairing themselves together and attempt to create wealth independently. But they could fail. 10% chance of a 1000K is still just 100K on average (it just has an interesting distribution of the payout). The difference up to 1000K is a payout to C for the risk they took in growing their business up to the current level of scalability. (otherwise other companies would pay more for the value that A and B provide)<p>If A and B care only about technology and are risk adverse, the economy doesn't award them more than the 150K which they are already getting. For such people, creating wealth of 1000K for the companies where they work is not a result of their behaviour, but a reward for the founders that took the risks and had the vision to create organizations allowing that.",1291075226

I used it several times when debugging drivers on OS 9.<p>I had thought that the OS X FW drivers didn't map any RAM until a driver requested some 1394 address space, but apparently that isn't the case... That would be the sane and easy way to fix this.",1329047871
3581607,comment,3579847,3581059,1,0,irahul,,,"> if Python had better function syntax and anonynous functions, decorators wouldn't even be a 'thing'<p>Better function syntax? What's wrong with python's function syntax and how does it relate to decorators?<p>Python does have anonymous functions, though they are limited: You can have only 1 expression, you can't have statements, and you can't have local variables. The reasoning is lambdas should be used for small operations; for everything else, named functions should be used.<p>The reasoning behind lambdas is arguable, but it still doesn't explain how it affects decorators.<p>Consider:<p><pre><code>    def memoize(fn):\n        from functools import wraps\n        @wraps(fn)\n        def memoized_fn(*args):\n            if not memoized_fn.cache.has_key(args):\n                memoized_fn.cache[args] = fn(*args)\n            return memoized_fn.cache[args]\n        memoized_fn.cache = {}\n        return memoized_fn\n\n    @memoize\n    def fib(n):\n        if n < 2: return n\n        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n\n    print fib(100)\n\n</code></pre>\nWhat would a <i>better function syntax</i> and <i>anonymous functions</i> do so that <i>memoize decorator won't be a thing</i>?",1329047760

A VC is only needed as a big lump of cash when that rule is broken very early on.<p>Any group can focus on generating profit from their ability to work well together and deliver to the world something that is truly needed and wanted.  A group that pays its bills forward and productively pushes its ability to generate revenues, no matter if consisting of two people or many, many more, has to manage this fact.<p>VC as an 'injection combustible' is definitely of value in markets, but I propose that the group dynamic as defined by the individuals actively contributing to the survival of the company is too often over-managed before this reality sinks in.  An executive team who have worked together to do big things in the past is really, sort of, a step above 'need outside help or else we are toast' levels of competence.",1329046558

I had the habit of checking my personal email, read BBC to see it the world was not in war and checking HN while the project I was working was building (I thought it was no big deal <a href=""http://xkcd.com/303/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/303/</a>). The big deal is that it affected my productivity. Period. When the program finished building or it aborted in the middle of the process of building, I was still thinking about something I read. It always took me some minutes before I was ready again to continue where I was.<p>Since the project I'm working can have long periods of building time (~up to 40minutes), I've started several projects while waiting for the program to build. Since they are all related to coding, I feel that I can swith taks much easily than reading news/checking email. And I believe I'll become a better programmer because of that (also because the projects I've started are tools to help me to perform my work).",1329046490

Both provide a pleasing tactile sensation and are easy enough to mess around with while thinking.<p>I also find it helpful to use this downtime to review how I've been working. The best thing I learned from the Pragmatic Programmer was to review my coding techniques and patterns, and see where there could be an improvement. Perhaps I spent the last 20 minutes fixing the wrong problem, or perhaps I didn't use a design pattern that would've made my code cleaner and easier to understand. Micro-breaks are a great time for these reviews because the code is fresh in your mind, whereas a retrospective when a release is done requires a lot more looking back.",1329046068

On a desktop designed for work you should only have links and bookmarks related to your work. A bookmark to Facebook is a constant reminder that there might be something new on Facebook, and it's sole effect is to distract you.<p>I also noticed that having an appropriate background music is important. In my case I like to listen to Progressive Trance music (mostly ETN.FM Channel 2), and I have hundreds of recorded shows of 1 or 2 hours each. The goal here is to maintain a rhythm : keep going as the music goes on. I never listen to this music when I'm not working, so I ended up naturally associating it with work.<p>Every time a music show ends, I take a few seconds to look back on what I did during the last hour : did I complete my task ? Do I need a break ? If I feel stuck or tired I stop the music, switch environment to browse Facebook/Mail/HN/whatever, then come back 20 or 30 minutes later. Then I start by ""reloading my context"", reminding what I was doing and what problems I needed to solve, having a look on my TODO list (paper), and when I feel ready I start the music again and begin coding.",1329045458

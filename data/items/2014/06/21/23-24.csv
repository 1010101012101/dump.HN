A part of my motivation was that I wanted to make these algorithms and techniques more approachable, and easier to understand, play with and apply. One issue right now is that I think I plunged into development and wrote a whole bunch of code and visualizations without fully supporting it with the necessary tutorials for a complete beginner. I&#x27;m hoping to change that over the next few weeks. Sometimes it&#x27;s a little hard to juggle this with research, and all the things I&#x27;m actually supposed to be doing.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to answer questions or get feedback on the project!",1403395119

If taken literally it would be impossible to define what a &#x27;bank&#x27; is, so I assume your definition of &#x27;Without regulation&#x27; involves regulations - which makes for a very confusing definition.<p>You imply there is an optimal outcome (thousands of medium-sized banks) being suppressed through regulation. What regulations force all banks to move quickly to a few larger banks? Usually these sorts of market regulations are about stopping that practice: for instance in Australia there is a &#x27;four pillars policy&#x27; which stops mergers of the four largest banks. Without this regulation there would be less competition.<p>> Overall, to characterize this as &quot;deregulation&quot; is completely sloppy thinking. We are never going to get a better situation when people think sloppily like this. To do so is, in practice, a moral crime. It supports maintaining the status quo through confusion.<p>Characterising deregulation as deregulation is sloppy thinking?

7926396,comment,7925493,7926341,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I understand the science of impact. We can take a winter day and make it feel like summer by burning the forest down next to us. I also understand both the models and the limits of our understanding of them. We can take the current model of the climate and change the CO2 levels in it and sometimes reflect what we actually see when those CO2 levels change. We take the anomalies and we try to update the model. Ok so far so good. The models don&#x27;t tell us why the planet was warm and then it was in an ice age, they don&#x27;t tell us why it stopped being in an ice age in the first place, they don&#x27;t tell us anything how our actions (or inaction) could cause the climate to change in a way that we wish it to change.<p>We can speculate on those things, we can track down times in the geologic record where Yellowstone erupted and put dust high up in the atmosphere, we can look at iridium layers in the rocks and try to understand when large asteroids hit the planet and wrought havoc. And perhaps the biggest thing that is missing from the model is how the planet &#x27;resets&#x27; itself. We have had warm periods and cold periods and fluxed in between them, but the model doesn&#x27;t tell us how, the data tells us this happened, but the current model applied to ice cores from a million years ago gives a different answer than the data seems to indicate was true.<p>What all of that adds up to is that &quot;its complicated&quot; and we&#x27;re inside a system for which we don&#x27;t have a deep understanding of the variables and we have a scientific infrastructure which is actively discouraging the asking of certain questions or testing various hypothesis which are politically uncomfortable. That makes me think we aren&#x27;t doing as much as we can to understand the actual system, and our lack of understanding leads to an inability to predict what it will do, or how it will respond to what we do or don&#x27;t do. We are no more free to ask heretical questions about how climate works than Galileo was free to investigate whether or not the Earth was the center of the universe.<p>As we cannot summon the will to do the research we need to do in order to accurately answer the question of how the system works, I do not believe we will reach a point where we might understand what would be needed to move that system to a pre-determined point from some other known point.",1403394594

7926380,comment,7924836,7926170,1,0,MortenK,,,"1) Sure, when talking freelancers / contractors you of course have to account for a ~20% deduction for sickness and vacation. So the base wage increase is often around 100% but compared to a full-time position, it is closer to a 50% increase.<p>2) It is only unrealistic for freelancers doing many small jobs. Not for contractors with ongoing 40+ hour contracts, of which there is a lot on oDesk. Maybe the confusion is semantics: When I talk of 100% allocation, I mean 160 hours of available work. Over a year, you&#x27;d remove 10-20% for vacation and illness, like mentioned above.<p>Check the work history of the higher rated contractors on oDesk if in doubt about this. There are many doing much more than 160 hours on average.<p>3) This is certainly not the norm :-) Not a lot of companies are interested in hiring a person a thousand miles away for the same amount of the guy next door. Especially not the type of companies who can afford developers contracting at high-cost market rates i.e. 100-300 USD pr. Hour.

7926335,comment,7925777,7926081,12,0,bo1024,,,"Right. The curve demonstrates &quot;calibration&quot;. A separate question is daily accuracy, or what might be called &quot;sharpness&quot;.<p>One way to measure accuracy is to use a &quot;scoring rule&quot; each day. The scoring rule takes the prediction (a probability of rain), e.g. p=0.3, and the actual outcome, e.g. &quot;rain&quot; or &quot;no rain&quot;, and returns a numerical score, where higher is better. You&#x27;d expect a reasonable scoring rule to have properties like, the highest score is for predicting p=1 and it rains (or p=0 and it doesn&#x27;t), the lowest score is for p=1 and it doesn&#x27;t (or p=0 and it does), and so on.<p>The <i>log scoring rule</i> is a popular choice: If it rains, your score is log(p); if it doesn&#x27;t, your score is log(1-p). (Don&#x27;t let it bother you that these are negative numbers for p in [0,1]. Closer to zero is still better.) Notice that your expected score for predicting p is precisely plog(p) + (1-p)log(1-p), which is the negative of the entropy of the distribution, that is, -H(Bernoulli(p)).<p>Now, what we could do to measure accuracy is to average, over all the days, the log scoring rule applied to your prediction and the outcome. A perfect score would be if you predicted 1 every time it rained and 0 every time it didn&#x27;t, which would give you a score of zero; if you&#x27;re not perfect, you&#x27;ll have a negative score, with more negative being worse.<p>So the average score will be (the negative of) the average entropy of your predictions, which makes sense as entropy corresponds to &quot;uncertainty&quot;. (This is assuming your predictions are calibrated. If you are uncalibrated, i.e. you make predictions with little uncertainty but they are <i>wrong</i>, then you will pay a penalty in proportion.)<p>We can connect this to your idea of mutual information, if we had a more detailed setup. For instance, suppose that each day, nature picks a true probability of rain p&#x27;, then you observe some information related to p&#x27; and make a prediction p; then it rains with probability p&#x27;. Here, the best you could possibly do is to observe all the information and predict p&#x27;. Then your average score will be the average entropy H(Bernoulli(p&#x27;)). But if you are making poor predictions, then the theory of proper scoring rules tells us that your average score will be the average mutual information between the distributions Bernoulli(p&#x27;) and Bernoulli(p). (If we are using some scoring rule other than the log scoring rule, this mutual information, which comes from KL-divergence, is replaced with a &quot;Bregman divergence&quot;.)<p>Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t know this true p&#x27; each day, so we can&#x27;t actually use mutual information to evaluate forecasts, but we can still use the entropy, or log scoring rule.<p>For a survey on proper scoring rules (not very fun for the layperson I&#x27;m afraid), see <a href=""http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall12/papers/Gneiting07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall12/papers/Gne...</a>",1403392410

See, e.g., <a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au/wmo/lrfvs/reliability.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bom.gov.au/wmo/lrfvs/reliability.shtml</a>. \nReliability is considered separate from accuracy in meteorology -- the former evaluates success conditioned on what was forecasted, while the latter is an unconditional evaluation of success or failure.<p>Other facets of forecast &quot;goodness&quot; exist and are often considered in meteorology. A seminal paper on the subject was penned by Allan Murphy, who identified three types of &quot;goodness&quot; (consistency, quality, and value) and ten subsets of quality (including reliability and accuracy). See <a href=""http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/seagrant/ClimateChangeWhiteboard/Resources/Uncertainty/Mac1/murphy93PR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/seagrant/ClimateChangeWhiteboard/R...</a>. [PDF warning]<p>A popular companion to the reliability diagram is the Relative Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. Here different forecast probability thresholds are tested to calculate likelihood of success if the event occurred, and likelihood of error if the event did not occur. This evaluates what Murphy calls discrimination (forecast quality conditioned what was observed) which complements reliability. See, e.g., <a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au/wmo/lrfvs/roc.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bom.gov.au/wmo/lrfvs/roc.shtml</a>.<p>Curiously, accuracy tends to take a back seat in forecast verification to other aspects of quality, particularly in rare event situations. This trend first began in the mid 1880&#x27;s with the &quot;Finley Affair&quot;, a series of published articles debating how to evaluate tornado forecasts issued by the US Army Signal Corps. Murphy published a fascinating literature review on the subject and showed that many of the skill scores and debates born during the Finley Affair are still active today.

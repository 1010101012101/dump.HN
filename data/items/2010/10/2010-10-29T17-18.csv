WP7 has already been released, and I'm sure the folks in Redmond is working on the next release/updates. Do you get it now?<p>...Okay. It's not an easy job to align products and release cycles. Microsoft was already late on WP7. They probably missed a cycle and Android kicked in. Microsoft doesn't want to be late anymore. Meaning, they probably couldn't wait for IE9 for mobile to be released (which wouldn't be a HUGE job if you have a working, stable, and RC version of IE9).<p>In conclusion, Microsoft is being smart that they release the phone and let people dive/absorb/digest earlier instead of waiting for full featured phone OS with a HTML5 supported browser, which is still in beta for desktops. However, this just means..the next release of WP7 will be very interesting. Remember, Android and iPhone OS (which wasn't iOS at the time) weren't closed to feature complete with their first release. I'm an Android user, and I can remember when I first bought my Droid, it went through so many updates software updates. Companies just have to cut things if one or two things will block the entire release.",1288375165

They think it's a chance to differentiate their web properties, especially by moving them toward a rich-client model in which they already have experience. They tried to do that with Silverlight previously but didn't get enough acceptance from various quarters. They probably think it's an opportunity for their development tools business as well (in particular, <canvas> being a low level API leaves a lot of room for new frameworks on top of it).<p>2. If rich-UI, CPU/GPU-hungry HTML5 sites become common, people who haven't upgraded in a while will need newer browsers and PCs to view them correctly. Of course, Microsoft is hoping to encourage them to move to IE9 and therefore to Windows 7, but even if they go to another browser instead, if they're on older computers they'll still need to <i>upgrade their PC</i> for the sites to run well, regardless of what browser they're using, and by default that means moving to a W7/8/ ... machine.

Yeah, they're currently doing good on getting IE up to spec. Even though its still not 100% there, but that's ok since its in beta. When its officially released, it will matter then. What I firmly believe is going to happen is that IE9 is going to get released and will get the occasional security patch, but they're going to stop doing major development on it and again the MS browser will stagnate for years again.<p>So everyone should stop getting excited when Microsoft says they're doing this one thing or another.

When I was a TA (i.e., ""I don't write the tests, but I'll help you pass them""), I got typical evals of about 4.5. When I became a postdoc and started writing my own tests, my evals dropped to about 3. I don't think I became a worse teacher over the course of a single year, so I'm guessing my low evals resulted from not giving out easy tests.<p>(Not to mention several comments on the evals claimed that tests were too hard.

You've already paid the search cost before you decide on the valuation.<p>Extreme example: It costs $100 to find each start-up, and you are arguing over a valuation of $1 or $2.  Paying $1 instead of $2 won't let save you enough cash to find another start-up.<p>(2)...if the market cannot be approximated as infinite because there are only a couple of Googles.  In other words, when valuations drop to half, you can only double the number of bets <i>if</i> there are other similar bets to be made.<p>So when Paul Graham says<p>>Did they not understand that the big returns come from a few big successes, and that it therefore mattered far more which startups you picked than how much you paid for them?<p>He's either mistaken or (more likely) he's implicitly suggesting that one or both of the above factors are very strong.

Not all marketers are tech morons -- the ones that aren't know a good product when they see it, get excited, and want to tell the world about it.<p>It's one of those innate desires. When you see a great application, you may want to get deep down into the inner workings and understand/improve it (I'm assuming). The marketer you're looking for should be interested in how it works and how to improve it, of course, but he should also clearly see your current product and future iterations on everyone's desk innately. That way the two of you can chase your respective visions: you with the better product, the partner with getting the product out into the world.",1288371975

(Kidding about the diaper money. Mostly.)  Over a million dollars down the drain.<p>Part of its USP was that you bought and sold only with registered users, and there was to be a feedback system so both buyer and seller could feel a bit safer. That feedback system would appear roughly similar to eBay's, though far richer.<p>It had global ambitions and would cover more than eBay's does. For example, it would have name verification like Amazon and would even obtain credit rating information from anyone  willing to give it up (this would make more information for sellers, obviously). At least one elegant algorithm was involved, but we were dealing with old media as our distribution mechanism and they didn't get new media.<p><p>The idea of developing and maintaining a solid online identity with different views of trustworthiness makes sense to me.

117763,comment,117588,117685,0,0,pmjordan,,,"That's a tricky one, as flash drives have special logic built in to <i>avoid</i> repeatedly overwriting the same block to prevent deterioration. On the other hand, bypassing that logic in order to read out the data in the extra blocks is not possible in software, (unless there's a backdoor) and I don't know if the logic sits on the controller chip or the actual flash chip. If it's the latter, it'll be pretty damn hard to get to.<p>EDIT +1 for mentioning c't",1203285211

117761,comment,117470,117493,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"3 years ago Apple still used PowerPC chips. The marketing emphasis was on the capabilities of PowerPC, such as SFP and DPF, over the x86 chips.<p>Due to various reasons, the PowerPC designs has languished while Intel has surged forth with Core Duo chips and with Apple's transition to the same Intel chips that ALL manufacturers have access to, it should be obvious the marketing emphasis has to be something else. To, I don't know, Mac OS X, user experience, and design perhaps?",1203285006
117760,comment,117588,117735,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I don't think anyone claims it's possible to read said data using standard drive firmware, so comparing it to uninitialised memory isn't the whole story. I always figured the theory was that if the cell was magnetised twice, you could tell from the magnitude of the resulting field not only its current magnetisation but also its history. I can see how that might be possible based on magnetic properties of real materials. ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis_loop#Magnetic_hysteresis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis_loop#Magnetic_hyster...</a> ) However, you'd have to take an analog reading, not a binary one. The idea here being that N, then S magnetisation ought to yield a weaker S magnetisation than S, S.<p>Strong enough magnetisation will erase that history though, and presumably make the current data more long-lived and random bit-flips rarer. I'm just wondering if the tech used back in the days wasn't sophisticated to magnetise cells strongly enough. (without affecting neighbouring cells)<p>Yes, I probably am thinking about this too much. I guess that serves me right for doing a physics degree at university. :)",1203284967

I've seen the 3.6 MIT student get rejected, while a 4.0 student from a ""lesser"" school gained admission.  It happens.<p>As I said, a high GPA from MIT isn't going to hurt you, but it's not a golden ticket, either.  If nothing else, grad schools like the GRE because it's a standardized metric.  Still, neither GRE score nor GPA are particularly good predictors of success in graduate school, and the committees know this.",1203284416

I would expect to see a more granular, dynamic approach in website verbiage as NLP matures.  For example, at my day job they argue semantics endlessly.  Tailoring a websites' grammar to the user could increase effectiveness.  This is an area I consider fascinating and wouldn't mind chatting more about it off line if you like.",1203284153

117747,comment,117118,117650,0,0,curi,,,"Regarding contradicting goals: I think the way to tie things together is a common <i>endpoint</i> (the truth of the matter). If you move all your goals in that direction, it will cause them to become progressively less contradictory.<p>You can also remove contradictions locally if you find any. If you want, you can say that is based on the common foundation ""if two ideas contradict, at least one is false"". But the point is, you see a contradiction, you know at least one of the ideas is mistaken in some way, so you know there's room for improvement there, until you come up with some changes that remove the contradiction.",1203283255

117744,comment,117118,117537,0,0,curi,,,"Regarding criticism, perhaps we can agree that enjoying and seeking out <i>good</i> criticism is important. That means, for example, if you know a source that has a good chance to provide some partially true criticism you may not have thought of, then it'd be a good idea to ask for it, and to like that kind of experience.<p>On the other hand, if you judge a source of criticism is going to be a waste of time, then it's fine to skip it. Not because you would ever ignore or disregard a criticism without thinking about it, and definitely not due to disliking criticism, but just because you reasonably expect they'd give criticism you'd already considered and rejected, and you have better things to do that you judge will bear more fruit.<p>The reason I'm not too worried about drowning in low quality criticism is that if there is no new information, it only takes a few moments to properly address. You don't have to ignore it because it's such a fast process. Just remember your take on the subject, verify that it already addresses what's being said, and then you're done. Don't even reply. But I don't call that ""ignoring it"", since you do quickly think about it, and if you notice there is something new to you, it will get proper consideration.",1203283042

I'll drop it after this comment, and you can have the last word if you want.<p>I'm not even going to make a full argument, but I do want to point out that if people from many cultures/eras/etc have different ideas about something, that is not evidence that there isn't a truth of the matter.

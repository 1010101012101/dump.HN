3857929,comment,3857351,3857351,3,0,VanL,,,"I celebrate the impulse that gives rise to this, but I am skeptical that it will work in the long run. The reason why is that these sort of documents are social contracts just as much as they are legal contracts - this is Twitter saying publicly that they won't be evil with their patents.<p>The problem is that this document has enough loopholes that it only slightly ties the hands of the patent assignee (Twitter, in this case). I understand perfectly why those loopholes are there, but I think that this will backfire at some point in the future when there is a ""defensive"" use that, at least from the outside, doesn't appear defensive. It could be because there is a perceived threat, it could be because the inventor agrees, it doesn't matter. At that point, the legal agreement will be kept, but the social agreement broken, and that will be devastating.<p>The most clever bit here is that this agreement is designed to run with the patent so that it makes the patents less likely to be asserted when they are sold. That is a good thing.<p>As it is, though, my favorite tool for this sort of thing is the Apache license. That allows everyone who is playing nicely in the sandbox to do so - but it also allows the patents to be cross-licensed effectively and defensively asserted against existing litigation.",1334757596

And most of the arguments you hear using the word ""monopoly"" imply the older definition that I'm using, but apply it to much looser definitions. For example, MS was never even remotely close to having a monopoly on operating systems. In fact, such a thing is not even really fathomable.<p><i>PS: The reason you don't need 100% market share to count as a Monopoly is once your competition can't meet the full needs of the market so you can increase prices which in theory causes a loss of market share, significant barriers to entry can dramatically slow this process down.</i><p>I didn't quote your entire paragraph, but I'm referring to all of it.<p>This kind of reasoning (which is reasonable and extremely common) is totally rationalistic (which is properly defined, by the way, as being an argument that seems deductively valid but is divorced from the way reality really is). I could talk about this at length, but I'd rather just give a short example for now. Imagine I'm a big business. If I'm consuming a particular kind of product as an input to my production, and one particular supplier charges a very high price, it wlll be greatly to my interest to either invest capital to produce it on my own, or (much more likely) seek out new producers to enter the market. If the existing supplier then tries to manipulate prices to drive the new competition out, only planning to raise them right after, I'll just see through it and continue purchasing from the new producer. A group of companies in my industry could even come to a mutual agreement of this sort to ensure that new competition enters.<p>The point is, in a capitalist (that is, politically and economically laissez-faire system), people don't just keel over when there are problems in the market, if those problems are actually big enough to be worth solving.",1334756864

To them, working is a means to an end. It doesn't actually mean they're not passionate about it, just that they have separated it to a different part of who they are and what they care about. I believe that was the point of the 501 Manifesto.<p>On the other hand, it's not strange to seek unity between your passion and your work. This is a great path for those who desire to have their material accomplishments define part them and is basically a necessary attitude for living in a meritocracy. It doesn't mean that you dislike your family, friends, and free time, simply that you feel that creation is also of central importance.<p>It's just different ways to self actualize. You can't compare them, really. You can accept the differences and work with people however makes everyone the happiest and most productive, though. 501 programmers may not have the same need to do exciting, groundbreaking work. They also don't want to spend the time. It doesn't mean you can't make use of them and make everyone perfectly happy. It may mean you don't want to actually work with any of them if you're trying to do something very difficult.",1334756818

Take a couple of passages from the story as evidence:<p>> <i>Few investors were interested in betting on a hardware startup, or dealing with the headaches that often come with manufacturing goods.</i><p>Let's assume ""investors"" are people with some knowledge of funding hardware based products. This group of individuals is going to look at the product (the upsides) as well as the challenges (the risks). A project might have tremendous upside on the product side, but an experienced hardware investor is able to identify the risks. I'm not a hardware investor, but anything involving wireless (even Bluetooth) automatically sets off warning buzzers in my head. I'm sure hardware-oriented VCs looked at this product and saw their own set of ""uh oh"" problems, thus they decided not to fund it.<p>> <i>Migicovsky said hes more adept at pitching to consumers than to venture capitalists.</i><p>I'm not sure Migicovsky is entirely aware of what he's saying here.

But in practicalities... Peresumably you get 2 benefits from compiling the code to bytecode:<p>* obfuscated source so people can't steal your secret sauce.<p>* faster execution because the compile step is skipped.<p>The second one has real practical limitations: for any major gain, the bytecode has to be in a format that allows fast execution, which usually includes taking out certain checks that can be done at compile time, taking advantage of lower level runtime stuff and in some cases, optimizations for the hardware arch below. This is all well and good, but when you have multiple engines interpreting the bytecode, this can be done in very different ways. In practice, to get from a robust bytecode to something that takes full advantage of the system, effectively invokes a second compile step from bytecode to the vm's internal representation. This is what a  lot of JVMs do. I'm not sure anything would actually be gained in that case.<p>Further, a robust bytecode format would required, since there are already piles of hacks in the JS libraries we all use to handle various browser differences. To get a bytecode that allows this, we end up with something that looks more like a simple source code transform than any bytecode that gives significant speedup out of the gate.

Original comment:<p>I mentioned this in another thread, but it is actually simpler than that. As I read it, the twitter agreement gives all rights in the patent to the assignee, just like any other assignment, but it adds on the clause that the assignee agrees to get permission from the inventor if they want to sue offensively with the patent. In the future, if the assignee (whoever it is at that time) decides to sue offensively without the permission of the inventor, the assignee can (and indeed they have the right to, as the holder of all the rights in the patent). The inventor would then have a cause of action for breach of contract against the assignee, but who knows what that would amount to.<p>Basically, I doubt that a court would read the agreement in a way that prevents the future patent assignee from using the patent offensively, even without the agreement of the inventor.",1334755795

3857731,comment,3852341,3855163,1,0,lmm,,,">I don't see a reason that ""normal"" investors would be at an arbitrage disadvantage if trading on an exchange that was discretized to, say, 100ms. Arbitrageurs would still have an incentive to keep the prices on the ""slower"" exchange in line with the ""continuous"" exchange's prices, trading at the discrete ticks to exploit price differences. So, price differences past an epsilon shouldn't persist for more than a few ticks, which is more than fast enough for most non-HFT investors, who don't typically make trading decisions with anything close to sub-second precision anyway.<p>Sure, but what you're missing is that the slow exchange's prices are always going to be worse. Not a lot worse - probably only a penny either way on some ticks, and zero on other ticks - but a little. So why would any investor with the choice ever choose to trade on the slow exchange rather than the continuous one?",1334754926

Even if everything he says is spot-on, I don't see a positive call-to-action here.  If all this is supposed to be is someone in the know saying ""don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining,"" that's one thing, and I can get behind that, in a way.  What I <i>can't</i> get behind is the implicit call for technology not to be developed, or for new business models not to be tried.<p>The 20th century was a complete historical outlier in the support given to professional musicians, brought on by a confluence of technology that had a high barrier to entry but low barriers to distribution.  That situation has now changed, and it's inevitable that there's going to be a squeeze.<p>One specific issue I do take with what he's saying comes here:<p><pre><code>    But what many of you forget is that IT IS MY CHOICE whether I choose 
    to give away my songs or sell them.  IT IS MY CHOICE how and where to
    distribute my songs.  IT IS MY CHOICE to decide which websites get to 
    exploit my songs.   Like it or not, the right to control one’s 
    intellectual property (like songs) is a constitutional right.
</code></pre>
The first of those choices I have no disagreement with.  That's just the nature of how he chooses to distribute his work in the first place.  However, from then on, while he does have rights in the work, <i>those rights are limited</i>.  I wonder what he'd say the proper length for a copyright term should be?  As much as he conflates free software fans with software patent owners, I could easily conflate this part of his talk with the actions of the copyright lobby to extend copyright in perpetuity.",1334754888

This solution is simply putting lots of sites on a single instance, which is fine, but how does the port translation work across multiple instances? We ran into this problem recently while architecting a solution for our customers and we ended up using multiple ELB's to point to multiple EC2 instances. Sure at $20/mo its probably a slightly more expensive route, but it solved all the benefits of what is being promoted here. For those that don't realize ELB's can act as SSL endpoints. I believe RackSpace allows a similar such thing. It also means that no complex port/ssl configuration occurs on the web servers, they are actually much easier to deal.",1334754296

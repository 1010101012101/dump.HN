Even if someone saw the genius in your approach early on and decided to clone you and start competing with you, you have to be confident that your version of your idea will continue to be better than their version. You still have all the advantages of branding, community, and users, whereas their version has no advantages except perhaps a lower price (which doesn&#x27;t apply to many products, like your AirBnb and Youtube examples).",1391968679

First, they could have a policy that has an Annual or Lifetime payment limit, which would leave the company (or individual) responsible for anything over. Alternatively, if the number of incidents was significantly higher than average for the carrier, AOL could see a significant premium increase due to the higher utilization of their plan. Or, they could actually be running a self-funded insurance program, which means they are managing the risk instead of relying on a separate insurance carrier.<p>Either way, there are several situations in which AOL&#x27;s costs could be significantly impacted by the situation.",1391968514

7206240,comment,7203042,7205543,2,0,ufmace,,,"This type of game theory mostly only deals with the principal actors and their direct reactions, though. What&#x27;s often more important is what everybody else in the world thinks of the actions. A nuclear exchange is not the end of the world, and what that world looks like afterwards will be shaped by what people think of your actions. That&#x27;s mostly what I was addressing. In the event of a nuclear attack by a &#x27;rouge state&#x27;, i.e. one that doesn&#x27;t have enough weapons and delivery systems for a major attack, the world will be looking very closely indeed at what our response is.<p>A response that is not sufficiently swift and terrifying could embolden our enemies/rivals. It could also make countries allied to us and trusting the protection of our nuclear umbrella doubt the protection of that umbrella. They might seek to ally with our rival countries instead, or build their own nuclear deterrent. Consider Japan, for example. China is their rival, and a nuclear power. Japan has no nuclear weapons of their own, as they trust us to back them if China threatens them with nuclear weapons. If they have reason to doubt that our backing is not sufficient to deter China, they might seek to build their own nuclear arsenal instead.<p>Of course, a response that is seen as excessively brutal and/or unconsidered could potentially cause diplomatic issues as well. Countries unfriendly to us might become more worried about what we might do, and might seek a better arsenal of their own, or closer alliances with nuclear powers opposed to us. Countries friendly to us or more allied to us might become worried about what we might to do them, or about being associated with our actions, and might become more distant.<p>In reality, there will probably be some of both reactions, no matter what we actually did.<p>I&#x27;m inclined to be rather skeptical of nuclear pre-emption because of the second. Not quite 100% against, but the situation would have to be very clearly defined as it being a necessity. In the case of North Korea, in the world as it is today, I don&#x27;t see it being necessary because of Chinese influence. China is clearly okay with having North Korea be a thorn in our side, but they very much don&#x27;t want to let North Korea do anything that might provoke us into either a conventional or nuclear attack against them. They don&#x27;t want American troops or American nuclear weapons detonations right on their border. They have a lot of influence with North Korea, being pretty much the only thing between them and starving and freezing in the dark.<p>I also have a nice essay around here somewhere describing how your stereotypical crazy dictator tends to get very sane very quickly when faced with the prospect of nuclear war. China, India, and Pakistan have toned down the crazy considerably since becoming nuclear powers.<p>Note that the last 2 paragraphs treat the world as it is today - where any actor launching a nuclear attack could very reasonably fear a swift and devastating response. This is exactly what a nuclear attack by another country followed by a response perceived as weak could change. It might, for example, turn nuclear pre-emption into a necessity instead of an unfavorable option. If we couldn&#x27;t count on Chinese and North Korean fear to deter an attack, we might have to actually launch a pre-emptive attack to stop theirs.",1391967785

It&#x27;s a moral responsibility of the employer. Work takes up such a large portion of a person&#x27;s time and energy that if the company isn&#x27;t invested in the employee&#x27;s progress, he owes that company nothing. My work ethic is strong as hell, but if I get the sense that management isn&#x27;t interested in my progress, I slack as a matter of principle. If your manager isn&#x27;t looking out for your career and you put more than about 10-15 hours per week in on your assigned work, you&#x27;re just a chump. (In the MacLeod analysis, a Clueless.)<p>That said, expecting your employer to manage your progress and education is unreasonable, because no company can possibly account for the variations in peoples&#x27; abilities and desires. Even if your employer is genuinely well-intended and wants you to advance-- let&#x27;s ignore the 80% of companies that aren&#x27;t this way-- your company will figure out where you should go much later than you will. That&#x27;s why open allocation is the best solution: the workers can figure out what&#x27;s worth working on faster than central/upper management.<p>So, yes, it&#x27;s a moral responsibility to the employer to give the employee time and resources to look out for her career (and, if it doesn&#x27;t, engineers should slack). However, for the employee to put the self-executive responsibility of picking out what to learn on the company is, in practice, an irresponsibly bad idea.<p><i>By my third year I saw the microcomputers were going to be the future and wiggled my way into the group that worked with them.</i><p>The problem is that most modern companies have such mean-spirited, insane policies regarding performance reviews and internal transfer that internal mobility is pretty much impossible in them. At a closed-allocation tech company, the only time you can realistically get a transfer is when your performance history is in the top-10%-- in which case, lateral transfer is a terrible idea anyway, because you should wait for the promotion instead of restarting the clock. Closed allocation and Enron-style performance reviews are all about inhibiting mobility, i.e. keeping the poors in their place.<p><i>But once you discover you are obsolete it&#x27;s too late. Assuming your employer will retrain you is a fool&#x27;s pipe dream. These days employers may drop you, your job, your projects, or even the whole company without much notice, and then you have to find a new job. Expecting them instead to retrain you is not going to happen.</i><p>This is why I hope to see a French Revolution-style uprising. Silicon Valley looked like a way out, a &quot;middle path&quot; between serfdom and violent revolt. Now that that middle path is closed due to the VC good-ol&#x27;-boy network, I think that a (probably global) class war is just an eventual necessity. It may come next year, and it may come in 50 or 100, but I hope that it&#x27;s the last major war humanity has to endure.<p><i>In programming you need to look forward because the only thing behind you is that nasty steamroller.</i><p>Honestly, I get the feeling that this guy was very lucky. He had the autonomy to pick new technologies <i>and he picked winning horses</i>. Imagine what he&#x27;d be writing if, instead, he&#x27;d learned Blackberry app development. Or, what he&#x27;d be writing if his manager, long ago, had fired him for attempting the transfer to the microcomputer team (possibly forcing him to take a suboptimal job due to financial pressure, with long-term effects on his career). He should at least attribute some of his success to having been luckier than most engineers.",1391967472

Technology is about expanding capacity; the anti-intellectual mainstream business culture is about zero-sum dynamics and competition for its own sake.<p>If you&#x27;re smart about it, you hire programmers because of their ability to <i>solve problems</i>. If she used Ruby for 10 years and did great things, and you use Clojure, no matter. People can learn new things. The core ideas and competencies haven&#x27;t changed much. The tools and APIs seem to have a half-life of 5 years, except for the proven winners (C, Unix, Lisp as a concept if not a specific dialect yet).<p>If you&#x27;re a dumbass, however, you hire based on trivia. You ask for minuscule details of C++ templates or Python metaclasses or JVM internals. You let your HR write hiring specifications like &quot;must have PhD and 5+ years in <three-year-old technology>&quot;. The trivia questions are fine interview material if the person is claiming to be an expert in that technology. They&#x27;re useless at determining whether a person is generally capable.<p>The problem is that companies tend to fuck up one of two opposing ways. The more common failing is the HR fuckuppery I described above, of hiring for specific easy-to-learn skills rather than actual capability. This tends to hurt older people, who (after a decade or so, when all the half-hearted programmers have dropped out) want to develop genuine competence rather than chasing every crappy new thing that pops up. That seems to be why every good programmer above 35 either wants to be an architect or data scientist or something other than a &quot;regular ol&#x27;&quot; programmer, i.e. an &quot;X who programs&quot;; because the way programmers are evaluated is completely borked.<p>The (much less common, but still irritating) opposite end of the spectrum is the &quot;hire ALL the talentz&quot; attitude you see at certain very large tech companies, where they &quot;hire generalists&quot; but that&#x27;s an excuse for a one-size-fits-all, CommodityDeveloper, internal attitude. If you&#x27;re running a closed allocation shop, you really can&#x27;t hire people &quot;just because&quot; they&#x27;re talented. You have to hire to the specific role or you&#x27;ll have a morale problem and possibly an HR disaster inside of 12 months.<p>So, really, the only way to avoid falling into one of these vicious patterns or the other is to implement open allocation. But we all knew that already.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that there&#x27;s a steamroller. It&#x27;s that it&#x27;s driven by idiots who don&#x27;t understand the first thing about <i>any</i> creative process-- closed allocation is a laughably terrible idea-- much less a constantly changing one like technology.",1391966021

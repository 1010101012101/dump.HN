Not sure why there&#x27;s the arbitrary line being drawn here of dependent type systems.<p>Some of this is about the penetration of certain ideas.  Like, we had to wait for multiple cores on commodity hardware before functional programming started to cross over from the academic community to the professional web programmer.<p>That shift helps your average programmer to think a bit more mathematically, and then it&#x27;s basically about whether the programmer starts to appreciate types - and to me that seems to be less about purity of argument than the professional atmosphere the programmer is in.  Are you prototyping and moving fast and breaking stuff, or are you caring more about longevity and correctness.<p>And then once you start getting more into static typing and functional programming, a lot of these other ideas start to become more attractive and intriguing.<p>It&#x27;s like a lot of ideas that circulate around for a long time before they really take hold; you&#x27;re waiting for a certain critical mass of system inputs and momentum, and then things can start to change really fast.",1443592733

In both cases the photo is irrelevant. Once you have to look through each item for 10-20 seconds bare minimum, the Tinder model doesn&#x27;t make sense anymore.<p>Another key UI consideration is filtering. In the hiring and events examples, you can easily filter algorithmically by skills, years of experience, event type, or location. But physical attractiveness can&#x27;t be algorithmically filtered on. So Tinder occupies a unique niche where the selection criteria is 1) impossible to automate because it&#x27;s vague and subjective but 2) easy for each individual user to evaluate in a split second.",1443592727

They always pop up to claim that no matter how strongly you believe that advertising&#x27;s manipulation does not affect you, it does.

Wealthy, socially progressive countries with high standards of living?<p>You&#x27;re just spreading FUD. PR was one of a great many factors involved in the rise of Hitler, but keep in mind that the US system also let a president get elected that didn&#x27;t win the popular vote, who then went on to destroy a foreign country to drum up domestic political support. Literally hundreds of thousands of people died in Iraq to make Bush more popular in the US, despite Iraq having nothing to do with threats to the US.

Sadly, as much as I want to go electric, I have no use for it, at $140K for an SUV I expect a lot more than this.<p>I think the falcon doors solve a non-existing problem while parking.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time this was an issue, with or without kids, with or without cargo or bags on the back seat of either an SUV or a minivan.<p>The same is true of the third row seat.  We&#x27;ve had both SUV&#x27;s and minivans with third rows.  Never an issue, even for adults.<p>The falcon wings are very cool from a technological perspective but a complete non-starter for me.  Bikes, surfboards and other stuff need to go on a roof rack.  I can&#x27;t see any way to transport our Maas rowing shells on this thing.  They are 24 feet long and have to go on the roof.  I&#x27;ve even brought home 2x4&#x27;s and sheets of plywood from Home Depot on top of SUV&#x27;s and minivans.<p>Can you open the falcon wing doors by hand if you have no power?  I&#x27;d be surprised if this was not possible.<p>Towing is another aspect of this car that is likely to disappoint outside of a stage.  If anyone expects to be able to do 250 miles while towing a 5,000 lbs trailer on anything other than an absolutely flat road with a 60 mile per hour tail winds they are going to be disappointed.  As drag increases so will current draw and electrical losses, which will be constant and very significant.  Weight is more of a factor on non-flat roads, which is nearly 100% of them anywhere I&#x27;ve been.  I&#x27;d be surprised if the actual range while towing is much more than half the rated non-towing range.<p>What&#x27;s good?<p>Crash performance is fantastic!<p>HEPA filter:  Unreal.

The key feature they share is the space and seating that they provide, but having off-road capability is useful to a small subset of SUV owners and is just there to add to the cool factor that differentiates it from a minivan.<p>Tesla is trying to grab the wealthy, 30-to-50-something parents whose focus on luxury and style prevent them from buying a minivan, which would probably suit them and their driving habits better than an SUV.

Modern societies rely on the build up of capital to a much greater extent -- certainly more than I can list in a comment. The capital has been accrued over many decades -- I once read an article in Scientific American that the housing stock of modern Western societies runs on a cycle of about 80 years. The modern build up of capital, on which we depend, would include every form of infrastructure that you could think of, including space-age items such as communication satellites, plus many types that may not be immediately obvious.<p>Somewhere in the world, each generation must suppress some of its consumption so as to contribute to the accumulation of long-term capital. It used to be that savings were mostly confined to the nation in which they were originated, but of course, over the last 50 years we&#x27;ve seen the globalization of savings, and we&#x27;ve seen vast distortions to the global system, thanks to some countries, such as China, whose government engaged in the systematic suppression  of consumption, leading to what Ben Bernanke described as a &quot;global savings glut&quot;.<p>Contrary to what you said, a great deal of economic activity can be bottled up and saved for years. Just because we live in an era in which there was too much saving and too little consumption does not mean that, in the long term, saving is unimportant.<p>If by &quot;economic activity&quot; you mean activity that supports current consumption, then this is exactly backwards:<p>&quot;First-world countries are seeing massive demographic shifts towards old age, which means vastly more economic activity must go towards sustaining the retired&quot;<p>The opposite is true: First-world countries are seeing massive demographic shifts towards old age, therefore the need to raise productivity is more urgent than ever. In the USA, 70 years ago, there were 10 workers for every 1 retired person. In 20 years, there will be 2 workers for every 1 retired person. There we need to see a 500% increase in productivity, over 90 years (measured from 70 years ago), to ensure that everyone can continue to enjoy the same quality of life.<p>In the past, the accumulation of capital played a large role in raising productivity, and therefore in the future capital might again play a large role in raising productivity. A vast campaign of investment is necessary, to raise productivity. Such a campaign is made easy in the current era thanks to the the low interest rates that were made possible via the global savings glut.",1443590828

However, the open road is more likely to get you killed if you are involved in an accident due to speed.<p>All this &quot;techy-BS&quot; is not belittling humans by creating self driving cars.

Your same argument falls flat with other technologies. Why have a computer add numbers when we have a wonderful brain that can do the same? I argue that it is because we build systems to augment and work around our deficiencies. One of those deficiencies is our driving skill. Over 30,000 in the US alone die due to auto accidents. Self driving cars has the potential to eliminate most of these deaths. Ideally, we&#x27;ll get to a point where a death on the road makes national news because of its rarity.",1443590158

That gives you lower overhead access to the video card than a monolithic kernel.<p>For compute-bound tasks such as bitcoin mining, a small realtime microkernel will give you better instruction cache utilization.  (Back in university system architecture class, I ran cache benchmarks under Linux, QNX, and Win2k on my triple-boot desktop, QNX gave me the best cache performance.)<p>If you need to run a high-performance webserver, if you need absolute performance, run it in-kernel.  If not, a microkernel (and a properly configured IOMMU) allows you to safely make your process the network driver as well as filesystem and disk drivers for your dedicated www data drive.  Now, you&#x27;ll want a second network port with its own chipset (perhaps on its own card) for being able to ssh in if the webserver crashes, but you&#x27;ll have higher performance than a monolithic kernel.<p>In short, microkernels along with appropriate hardware protections allow you to safely make your device drivers just ordinary libraries that run inside your critical processes, giving you higher performance without sacrificing security or stability.<p>EDIT: I should also point out that Oracle, Postgress, and other high-performance RDMSes go through a lot of work to do &quot;kernel bypass&quot;.  A microkernel with minimum cache footprint would better get out of their way and more safely turn over more functionality to the application.",1443589432

I&#x27;m ok with that situation because I understand and accept the logic of indexing.  If the fund I owned changed their prospectus and decided to start active management, or significantly increased their management fee, or whatever, I could pull my money out and invest it elsewhere.  Similarly in software there are definite advantages to having a dedicated steward for a given type of data, but it&#x27;s much better if there is some way to take your data back should you decide to put it elsewhere.<p>With Evernote, it <i>is</i> possible to export all your notes in a variety of formats, including XML, which can then be imported into other note taking applications if you wish. So to me, the bare fact that the application controls the data isn&#x27;t necessarily an issue.  What was becoming an issue was the fact that they didn&#x27;t appear to treat it with sufficient respect.  I hope we&#x27;ll see that start to change now.",1443589265

I agree that they would be more sensitive to constituent concerns, but isn&#x27;t it still perverse if half the population has no voice in government because the other side was tactically better? Also, it is still possible to discipline an egregiously bad rep even though they&#x27;re technically in a &quot;safe&quot; district, so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;ve totally lost control.",1443589220

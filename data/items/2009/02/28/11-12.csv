The corresponding comments are also good, but sometimes not good.I am a regular reader of these essays. So who posts the comments can be restricted, but sustaining HN will be good for the people like me, who learn a lot from it.But it is quite natural that one wants to just post some comments, just for the sake of being a part of the discussion.Once you keep reading good things for quite some time, your fingers itch to type in some comments. Yes, I agree that this is not good and one should observe some control.But please keep up HN, it is very good.",1235821307

498161,comment,497039,497948,0,0,moe,,,"<i>If his MacBook can handle the entire database so I don't see the need for a SAN (yet).</i><p>The SAN comes into play when a single box can't deliver the IOPS anymore - remember it's not just a matter of adding SSDs. At those rates you start touching the controller and bus limits. Likewise a saturated 10Gb ethernet link causes a significant interrupt-rate (older cards would bottleneck on a single core) that often exposes interesting corner-cases in your OS and hardware of choice.<p>I'm not saying it's not doable and I know what SSDs are capable of (we just fitted a server with X25's). I'm just saying that your estimate of $10.000 is very optimistic, add a zero and you'll be closer to home. That's because I still think you'd definately be talking an xfire 4600 class machine and a SAN.<p>Anyways, this is all speculation. Wheels made some reasonable statements that they have it on their radar and I'm definately looking forward to some real-world benchmarks with a concurrent write-load.",1235821152

I do have a queue of people that want to follow me that I haven't followed back yet, and it seems like this tool would help.  However, obvious spammers like ""ebaytochina"" had scores of 100%, where as members of my family were near the bottom of the list.  I don't understand what the DBI is (other than a database module for Perl), so I don't see how it can help me.<p>Anyway, it's kind of sad that people think that this is their path to ""fuck you"" money.",1235821117

498157,comment,497951,497951,0,0,netcan,,,"""Rent Seeking""<p>Say this works out in a big way & 2-3 cities take up this $30m challenge. The essay suggests $1m to move a startup, which suggests that having a startup in your city is worth (more then) a million. Why not offer them a million to stay (or half a million if they'll take it)?<p>What if the cities start bidding against each-other for the 'best' startups (assuming they end up with some mechanism for choosing the best ones). What if start-ups form specifically to take advantage of this scheme? What if angels/VCs that happen to rank highly on this list have all their investments get poached & presenting it as a benefit of taking their 1/4 million?<p>The perverse incentives, gaming & such might make this impossible to implement as a large scale government/municipal scheme.",1235820858

The last company I worked for developed trading software for foreign exchange and money markets. Only you couldn't ever sell it to traders; they were too afraid of being put out of a job. You had to go to the Head of Desk and sell him on the benefits.<p>As it turns out few of them actually were put out of work, many really were able to move up into trading more volume and higher-value instruments.

498152,comment,497492,497630,0,0,jaspertheghost,,,"It's true that you need additional skills to grow a successful company, but without the product/technical skills, you can't <i>start</i> recruit or sustain a company.  A <i>technical</i> company is primarily a function of its people and its products.  As companies mature, more adults that aren't as product focused come in and think it's entirely about brand, marketing, sales, etc.  It's true that those things that bring in the money, but once your focus shifts toward those areas, you'll inevitably turn into a EBay, Yahoo, or Apple (pre-Jobs).  When Jobs came back, he said the only thing he did was shift the company's focus toward ""product"" not marketing or sales.<p>I've had many non-technical friends that have had a ""great"" idea and wanted to recruit programmers.  It's never worked.  It's best if you have the skills yourself.<p>A lot of people were surprised that Amazon not Google dominates cloud computing or that it branched out to the Kindle.  Amazon has always had a technical culture focused on great user experiences. It's not a surprise at all when you take a look at it from that standpoint.",1235819816

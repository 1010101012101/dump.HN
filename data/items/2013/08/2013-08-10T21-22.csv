2.  Though about this a long time.
3.  Believe their should be three tiered fee system for patents.
4.  Low income entities--first two patents free.
5.  High income entities--pay 2x current fees.
6.  Anyone abusing the patent system would be barred for
a certain amount if time, or life.",1376171982

6192827,comment,6191512,6191964,1,0,digikata,,,"Preferred pricing for large employers, vs small employers, vs individuals never made sense to me except for private insurers to divide up groups to maximize profits. If insurers were simply trying to provide best-value, then every customer should be in the same risk pool and excess administration costs to create and apply different rules for different groups could be eliminated. Instead, all the private insurers create many groups with complex rules, different coverage levels, then have to administer all these slightly different rule sets. That complexity then has to be dealt with by everybody, the customer, the health provider, as well as the insurer themselves.<p>Profits are possibly maximized but value provided to customers and society is destroyed. I think this is pretty much reflected in the roughly 2x per capita costs for private healthcare in the US vs costs for universal care in many other first world nations.",1376171718

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.

As you may know, ShareCred is based on the philosophy that we need to reach out to people outside of our immediate circle. (Yes, HN allows that, agreed, but HN is very limited in expression, and not really interested in exploring the possibilities. You can think of ShareCred as similar to HN, but based on a blogging model, and bringing in controls based on one&#x27;s relationship and expertise.)<p>Assuming that you are with me so far (with regards to what ShareCred is), I would like to ask if the following feature is of any interest to anyone.<p>Feature: &quot;Ask questions to our 1st, 2nd, 3rd degree of relations (or to people with certain recognition), and getting feedback anonymously or not.&quot;<p>You can think of Quora being brought down to your 1st/2nd/3rd degree relations or people of certain recognition.<p>What I am seeing in this idea is couple of things. 1. Asking questions to people outside of your circle, but still controlled. 2. Getting answers anonymously from people in your circle, or not.<p>For example, a question such as &#x27;What wine do you drink?&#x27; is not something we want to put on Quora (of course, you can put on Facebook, but as I argued sometime back, it has limitations.) Such questions are ripe for limiting to your circles, and in some cases, benefit from anonymity.<p>What do you all think?<p>Thanks again for your time, ShareCred",1376169016

The power reactors discussed here are based on the KLT-40 reactors used in Taymyr-class icebreakers.<p>However, while a marine nuclear power source can be used to provide electrical power, we don&#x27;t tend to call them a &quot;power plant&quot; rather like how we don&#x27;t think of a 747 as a power plant, even though they also provide electric power.<p>For example, according to Wikipedia, &quot;Taymyr has two main turbogenerators aft of the reactor compartment consisting of Soviet-made steam turbines coupled to Siemens generators, each producing 18,400 kW of electricity at 3,000 rpm for the propulsion motors. In addition the ship has two auxiliary turbogenerators, manufactured in the Soviet Union, which produce 2,000 kW of electrical power for shipboard consumers.&quot; The first question that comes to mind is, is the 18,400 kW in three-phase AC? If not, then it can&#x27;t be directly used to feed a power grid.<p>Regarding the &quot;enough to power X homes.&quot; I don&#x27;t see red, but I&#x27;m close. The reference source is a bit better, saying &quot;up to 70 megawatts of electricity or 300 megawatts of heat, sufficient for a city with a population of 200,000 people.&quot; I&#x27;ll assume that&#x27;s 70 MWe for the people, vs. 300 MWt for heat.<p>How do they get that conversion ratio?<p>In the US, &quot;the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 11,280 kWh&quot; (<a href=""http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3</a>) giving 250 MW for a population of 200,000 people.<p>However, that&#x27;s only for the homes, which excludes industry. &quot;Per capita consumption from the electrical grid in 2011 was 13,187 kWh&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_the_United_States</a>) so that&#x27;s 300 MW for 200,000 people.<p>To double check myself, there are 1.392 million people living in Hawaii, and 800 GWh of power produced in the state, giving 314 MW/200,000 people.<p>To triple check myself, since that number is high compared to the 70MWe reference number, Gizmodo says that the &quot;260 million watts to power Google&quot; is &quot;enough to power a city of 100,000 to 200,000 people.&quot; <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5838458/google-uses-more-power-than-salt-lake-city"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5838458/google-uses-more-power-than-salt-...</a> . Yep, same ballpark as my previous two numbers: 300 MW.<p>Well, the US is known to be a high consumer of electricity. What about Russia? &quot;In per capita terms, electricity consumption in 2000-2006 grew 16.7 percent, reaching 6,864 kWh in 2006 compared to 5,880 kWh in 2000.&quot; (<a href=""http://www.rao-ees.ru/en/invest/reporting/reports/report2006/7_1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rao-ees.ru/en/invest/reporting/reports/report2006...</a> ), giving 157 MW/200,000 people.<p>This is still twice the 70 MWe that the Akademik Lomonosov is supposed to be able to deliver.<p>Hmm. Interesting. &quot;Akademik Lomonosov will be deployed at Vilyuchinsk, in the Kamchatka region in Russia&#x27;s Far East&quot; says Wikipedia. The population of Vilyuchinsk is 23,000 and all of Kamchatka is only 300,000 people. This again leads me to think that 200,000 is too high.<p>What do other people use as their ratios? In Turkey, &quot;It was presented that the total installed power of two areas will be between 35 and 45 MW and approximately 3,339 GWh will be produced. This amount is almost equal to a capacity that can cover the power need of a city with a population of 200,000 people&quot; <a href=""http://www.istac.com.tr/services/energy-production-from-wastes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.istac.com.tr/services/energy-production-from-wast...</a> . I&#x27;ll assume that they think 60 MW is needed.<p>In Bermuda, &quot;the highest summer peak demand of 122.8 MW was recorded in August 2010&quot; (and summer is higher than winter). <a href=""http://www.belco.bm/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=82&Itemid=111"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.belco.bm/index.php?option=com_content&view=articl...</a> . It looks like they average about 80 MW. That&#x27;s for a population of 64,700, so for 20,000 people it would be 240 MW.<p>In Indonesia, &quot;the demand from the towns current population of more than 200,000 people is estimated at well above 7.4MW&quot; <a href=""http://www.ephindo.com/responsibility/ephindo-and-the-community.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ephindo.com/responsibility/ephindo-and-the-commun...</a> (Its power plant can only put out 7.4 MW).<p>In closing, I don&#x27;t think the conversion ratio of 70 MW = a Russian city or a US city &quot;with a population of 200,000 people&quot; is correct. I think it&#x27;s off by a factor of at least two.<p>So, not only is it infuriating you, it&#x27;s also wrong.",1376168692

There are several posts that interpret this sound as the optimal sound for its associated task, as if it would have been less recognizeable if it had not been a marimba, or that particular group of intervals.

I felt really awkward making medical decisions for our employees. The HSA high deductible plan was the best option for my husband (co-founder) and myself, but I didn&#x27;t know if anyone had any medical issues, or when they intended to start families.<p>Also, we founded our company five years ago, and it was just the two of us for years.

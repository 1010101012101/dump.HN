Not predicting what you are likely to do, but exploring ahead of you.  Not based on your past, but your future... A very cool idea.<p>Actually, at present, it seems to be just a secondary ranking filter of statistical suggestions, so it would never consider an <i>original</i> action (i.e. that wasn't already likely). However, that kind of exploration would really be expensive.  Another problem is defining ""useful results"" generally, so it applicable to results not seen before.",1354874375

Cigarette smoke smells vile and triggers asthma attacks. From the Irish experience people go outside to the patio/courtyard. This means you can drink and smoke but people aren't forced to endure your pollution.<p>As far as public drinking goes, yes it is lovely but not all countries have as healthy a drinking culture as Germany. I loved going to the Neckarwiese with friends when I lived in Heidelberg and having some beers and a barbecue. But most countries have more Assis than Germany per head, more assholes who would start fights, be loud and obnoxious etc. Or just more binge drinkers.

4886189,comment,4885887,4885887,4,0,kevingadd,,,"The number of bytes of memory available on GPUs is hardly the biggest issue when considering rendering at more than 8 bits per channel of color precision. Even producing a 30-bit framebuffer (as has been supported for a while on many desktop GPUs) comes at a performance penalty and is incompatible with many pieces of software and hardware. Modern GPUs actually allow 16 bits per channel of precision when rendering, but it comes at a significant cost - various features no longer function, memory bandwidth is devoured, etc. You can't simply say 'we can spare the bits' and wave away all the technological challenges here, especially when the advantage gained from all those costs is comparatively miniscule.<p>To be fair, this sort of applies to retina displays as well: The hardware put into some of the Retina macs can barely handle the bandwidth demands of realtime rendering at such high resolutions. Until that problem is addressed, you certainly shouldn't be running around demanding >8bpc color precision.<p>Dithering for gradients could certainly make a minor difference in rendered quality, but I don't think most browser vendors are interested in making rendering performance <i>slower</i> right now - they're quite busy trying to make it faster. As evidenced by the fact that the OP's site runs like complete garbage in even modern browsers. Even if you spend the cycles and the power to dither, you're basically approximating something like another bit of precision. Is it really worth the cost just for another bit?

4886137,comment,4882291,4886056,11,0,dexen,,,"<i>>  the publishers never gave permission to use their content</i><p>Yes they did, yes they did. The publisher explicitly granted access by putting up the news content in an public subdirectory of a public webserver. News items don't just magically `pop up' in the public subdirectory of a webserver. Usually at least two employees (writer, reviewer) have to log into, and explicitly perform several steps in an CMS to publish a news item.<p>The decision of publisher is encoded as HTTP server configuration (including CMS, if any). The server obviously provides access only to some resources, as the operator wishes -- the ones meant for public consumption, while other resources are password-protected, only accessible from certain network addresses, or not accessible over HTTP at all.<p>Just as much as an image resource can be, and often is, protected from deep-linking based on HTTP `Referer' header, a news item can be protected from being indexed by Google News bot and displayed as a snipped in Google News based on `User-Agent' header.<p>In more details:<p>A typical User Agent that HTTP GETs some resources from the server describes itself with a `User-Agent' header. Google is honest here, and openly indicates its user agent as a spider bot, with explicit purpose of indexing content for web search.<p>Even better, Google uses a /separate/ spider bot for Google News service, and it is entirely reasonable to serve the general websearch bot with content -- so the website itself remains indexed -- and deny the news bot access, to prevent Google News from displaying news snippets.<p>Upon HTTP request, the server reads through request, including resource URL, headers (including User-Agent and Cookies, if any), compares that info to configuration. If, and only if, it matches configuration for unrestricted access, the resource is served. Otherwise, access denied condition is indicated and optionally authentication requested.<p>Let's assume for a moment the law goes through as requested by the press. The most probable implementation would be, Google includes a particular header in HTTP requests -- indicating itself as a `news-bot-that-has-subscription', and the server would, in turn, compare the header with configuration and either reply with news contents, or perhaps indicate access denied, should subscription expire, or for some other reason. The mechanics is pretty much same as it would be today to restrict Google News bot from gathering, and Google News from displaying (some or all) news snippets.<p>In short, the publishers have already configured some resources as protected from /some/ User Agents (based on request URL, headers, cookies, network address or anything else), and it is entirely their own choice they serve the news to both Google bots (websearch and news).",1354870914

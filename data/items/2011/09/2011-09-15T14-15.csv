3000614,comment,3000412,3000487,6,0,josefresco,,,"The documentation for WordPress is great (unlike many other open source projects), and the more time you spend with it the easier it becomes (like anything I guess).  Theme development is drop dead easy.  My best advice would be to <i>not</i> start with the default theme as your guide, but rather something much more stripped down.  The default theme includes a lot of features simply to show them off and most aren't needed.  Once you strip WP to it's core theme components building what you want back in is rewarding and really allows you to witness the power of this CMS.  Most free plugins and themes are crap, but the richness of the environment means that usually someone somewhere has done or tried what you want as well.  You can then use their knowledge to make your code even better (which you then maintain as opposed to relying on some student or freelancer who may or may not continue suppport)<p>Building your WP site, installing a free theme and a dozen plugins is definitely <i>not</i> the way a geek or true hacker should experience WP.",1316098746

The only problem is that you still need to leave room in case something catastrophic happens in front of you (deer, tire flat, etc.) Of course, if the system detects these events as slowing down of one vehicle, it could quickly slow others down, so you'd need less distance than with a human driver. <i>But</i> it only works so far.

What's to stop people from randomly broadcasting ""Traffic Jam Ahead"" signals to cause slowdowns, or maybe even ""Traffic Jam Behind"" to cause the vehicles to suddenly accelerate? Considering that, I think it would be possible to come up with an aftermarket module to regulate the behavior of the traffic swarm such that the user would reach his destination faster at the expense of slowing the rest of the swarm down. Any traffic swarming scheme needs to take this type of behavior into account, or else I don't think it would work out very well in practice.",1316098374

""Not having all the facts that time"" is also a hopeful and optimistic one, because it is non-permanent (you can get more facts) and specific to the situation (implicitly, it only comments on facts for that specific task, on that specific occasion).<p>Note that restating ""I wasn't trying hard"" as ""I'm a slacker"" makes it permanent (being a slacker isn't a one-off thing) and universal (being a slacker is an abiding trait, someone who doesn't try at anything; it's not specific to a particular task).<p>One could claim this is just arguing semantics; but these different words do express different causal explanations.<p>People tend to see patterns (perhaps especially programmers); so that if a person claimed they ""weren't trying"" a few times, we would tend to generalize that into an abiding trait, or even an identity, such as being ""a slacker"". I think this is interesting, because it illustrates a switching point between optimism and pessimism: you <i>could</i> interpret those few times as isolated incidents due to circumstances (""confining them to their facts""); or you could infer a regularity. Of course, the problem of pessimism is clearer when more extreme, e.g. generalizing a single instance into a universal rule.<p>BTW: according to the book it's not as simple as optimists being cognitively deficient at seeing patterns: for good events, an optimistic and hopeful approach is to see the pattern. While this is certainly convenient and self-serving, it's worth noting that doing it the other way (i.e. minimizing good event as one-offs and seeing a pattern in bad events) is also self-serving - just in a self-defeating way. The book makes a compelling and nuanced argument that it's better to err on the side of optimism (unless there are serious risks involved in failure).",1316097863

I also had just seriously started playing with NHibernate when Linq2Sql and the Entity framework came out. Same with lambdas and all that goodness.

Though I suspect they will matter a lot more a few years from now, when we'll be seeing more and more authors get their starts in self-publishing.

Solutions like these work in a theoretical universe with infinite matter and possibly over infinite time, but if the world is indeed finite (which it may very well be) any Big O expression containing the sum of all states of all atoms in the universe does contain a practical infinity.",1316095954

That is, they're almost always in insert mode and only briefly go to normal mode to change something.<p>The really important thing with any modal interface is that you have one primary mode which you only leave to accomplish a task and to which you return as soon as the task is done.  Even emacs has modes in that you're sometimes, say, doing an incremental search. The important thing is that when you're done you're dropped back to the usual mode by default.<p>For more on the theory of modal interfaces, see here:

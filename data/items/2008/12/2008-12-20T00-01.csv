Java also sometimes has odd names used in its standard library (for example, you use queue.offer() and queue.poll() to add and remove things rather than something like 'enqueue' and 'dequeue' or the standard push/pop.  An IDE prevents me from having to deal with looking it up constantly.<p>With Python and Ruby, I find a text editor sufficient and usually I'm doing web work with those languages which is perfect for vim/emacs over SSH.<p>PHP tends to have a huge library of builtin functions and it uses positional arguments (you can't call a function with arguments out of order denoted by keyword like python).

404044,comment,403147,404006,0,0,sebg,,,"No worries.  Thought about what you wrote above and here's my take on it: First, in defining boundaries of a system, we inherently create an ""inside"" and ""outside.""  By drawing boundaries, everything which adheres to a theory is ""inside"" and everything else is ""outside.""  I am not sure what you mean by capitalized ""Truth.""  If you mean it in a spiritual sense, then a theory that Jesus turned water into wine cannot encapsulate the opposite theory that Jesus did not turn water into wine. The ""Truth""  is that Jesus turned water into wine, so both notions cannot be part of the Truth.<p>In defining rational as ""logical steps that can be replicated with enough of a probability that it can't be a one-off event,"" we can take a look at Tibetan monks who can withstand freezing temperatures and control their body temperatures.  From a quick look, this appears to be a mystical power.  In freezing temperatures/snow storms, I would freeze to death while a monk can meditate for hours.  However, these monks can replicate these feats in such a way that they can train others to do this (even though it may take years).  Going back to our water to wine example, only one person, according to history, has been able to perform this feat.  The fact that it cannot be replicated with enough of a probability leads the event being label as non-rational.<p>For some things as enlightnement in zen/buddhist world views, there is no rational way to go from non-englightened to englightened.  However, the event has been replicated enough times that you could argue that this is a rational thing can and has occurred.",1229733011
404043,comment,403967,403967,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"First: If you think you want to write your own editor, you've answered your own question. You need to learn emacs, vi, or TextMate immediately, because these are editors that make it very easy to change their behavior by writing your own custom extensions.<p>I wouldn't write my own editor until I had learned <i>all three</i> of those editors. After that... I still wouldn't write my own editor. ;) Spend your energy on a problem that urgently needs solving.<p>Now to your question: First, I can't answer it, because I'm not really a user of any IDE. Second, I think it is ill-posed. It's like asking which is more productive: using emacs, using Ruby, or using Excel. If you're an expert in one of these tools, you can use it to replace the others to some extent (I just encountered a programmer who was using Excel to compose hundreds of SQL queries. I have to admit that it works, although it would never occur to me to do this; I'd reach for emacs instead or, failing that, Ruby or Perl.) But, in general, these three tools are designed for different problems, and each tool has its sweet spot.<p>There are languages for which the vast majority of programmers use an IDE. (I'd probably use one if I had to do any Java programming; Mac development in Objective C might tempt me to use XCode to write code; I'm pretty sure .NET programmers use Microsoft tools.) But you become a different kind of programmer when you use something like emacs instead. For one thing, your text editor can be used to edit <i>anything</i> that is made of text: Python, PHP, Javascript, SQL, C, Ruby, Perl, Lisp, Haskell, Erlang, Java, shell scripts, config files, HTML, CSS, LaTeX, directory listings, version-control logs, long emails, documentation, outlines, to-do lists, blog entries, Wikipedia articles... <i>ad infinitum</i>. If you improve your emacs skills, your skill at editing <i>all of these things</i> increases. If a new language comes along, or a radical new way of using an old language, you needn't be one of those tiresome people who sits on the sidelines, complaining, because the New Thing <i>lacks IDE support</i>: You've got an editor that works fine with the New Thing, and which you <i>already know how to use</i>, and you can incrementally improve that editor by teaching it some New Thing macros, and before long someone (maybe you!) will write some emacs modes to support the New Thing.<p>Meanwhile, emacs skills do not become obsolete. The editor is quite possibly older than you, and will almost certainly live as long as you. It's cross-platform and open-source. Because it is not tightly tied to one language, platform, version-control system, workflow, or vendor, it has transcended and outlived all of these things.",1229732979

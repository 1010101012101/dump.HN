I don't know what about reverting to a point prior to a merge would be difficult, unless you are in the middle of a merge at the time. Again, sounds like most trouble is caused by not understanding how to use what is a relatively powerful piece of software.<p>No one is stopping you from using the built-in OS versioning, SVN or Dropbox.

4201285,comment,4199917,4199917,1,0,eternalban,,,"CSP is an interesting take on concurrency but lends a degree of opacity to the scheduling of tasks.  So far (working in Go) in minor (or well understood patterns) it is a non-issue, but I wonder what would happen at large scale.  It is also worth noting that in Go 1 runtime, switching from 1 ""processor"" to N can certainly alter the behavior of your program e.g. the same precise [1] binary may lead to CSP/Go's version of ""deadlock"" e.g. ""all goroutines are sleep"" or not depending on simply 1 bit of difference in the binary.  The current runtime also gives rise to some interesting (and very unintuitive) performance differences when hacking with the CSP mechanism e.g. peppering GO sources with unnecessary sleeps, etc. to hack the scheduler.<p>[1]: well nearly the same.  Somewhere in the binary, a call to set maxprocs is present.  Same exact program differing only in the param to this call (i.e. 1 vs 2).",1341448525

The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics; one part to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. The prize for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical works by Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm; and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, but that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be a Scandinavian or not.""<p>After a settlement with Nobel's family, the foundation was set up with these rules:<p>""a) that the statutes, common to the prize-awarding institutions, dealing with the manner of, and the conditions for, the award of prizes as prescribed in the will, shall be drawn up in consultation with a representative nominated by Robert Nobel's family and submitted to the approval of the Crown; and<p>b) that there shall be no departure from the following main principles, viz: that each of the annual prizes established by the will shall be awarded at least during each five-year period from, and including, the year immediately following that in which the Nobel Foundation commences its activities, and that the amount of a prize thus awarded shall under no circumstances be less than sixty percent of that portion of the annual yield of the fund that shall be available for the prize award, nor shall it be divided into more than three prizes at most.""<p><a href=""http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/statutes.html#par1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundatio...</a><p>From the statutes of the Nobel Foundation:<p>""A prize amount may be equally divided between two works, each of which is considered to merit a prize.

I signed up after seeing them talked about here on HN, and so far have gotten around 1000 spins there, more than half off which have been ""more than 30 second listens"", which, based on my use of a ton of these services, serves as a decent proxy for ""I liked it, but not enough to make a comment/social media like."" I would easily recommend them to any artist looking for more exposure.<p>Management interface: Simple, quick, straightforward. They encourage high-quality files (192Kbps recommended), which a couple of their competitors still don't do.<p>Listening interface: newer style, full screen, big-everything interface. I like it, but I know some can't stand this style. They took the ""Sixty-one"" style and did it better (and unlike 61, they having working genre channels, which 61 has not gotten around to fixing after a couple of years of waiting.)<p>Price: Currently unbeatable. Bang for the buck is really excellent.<p>Reporting: Quick, but still scant. No one beats Jango at this at the moment. See below.<p>Listener targeting: a weak point. Targeting by similar artists and the ability to self-categorize/tag would be a nice addition. For eclectic artists, single subgenres don't work too well. Allowing multiple genre choices would be best (everyone from King Crimson to Radiohead to Candiria to my project all have a tough time with single genres.)<p>Customer service: Like many new, hungry startups. They jump all over every email. Very good.<p>Now, their competitors:<p>last.fm - So-so interface. Terrible analytics. Reports constantly out of date. Unbelievably, shockingly, mind-blowingly, pricey for what they give you. Does have the ability to add ""similar artists"" when creating a campaign rather than in advance, which is nice. Slow to update the management interface. Poor customer service. They are still considered a big dog, but they've fallen way behind their newer competitors.<p>MadeLoud - Straightforward, no-frills, and delivers exactly as advertised, but options are limited due to the format (they give you ""promoted downloads"" - no streaming.) Very cheap. Good customer service.<p>Grooveshark - So-so management interface, analytics/reporting system, and demographic targeting. No longer truly self-serve, which is a downer. They are quick to respond when you want to create a new campaign, but the self-serve system was much better. Pricing is decent. Ability to target similiar artists is present.<p>Jango - the best out there at the moment, aside from their prices (which are still good, but Earbits wins hands down on this front.) Thorough analytics. Very customizable promotions - their listener targeting system is unmatched (supports ""similar artists"", has auto-complete suggestions, the works.) Has never been down, can't ever recall having a system feature not work. Email collection capabilities, artist homepages, real-time listener feed, notifications for many relevant conversion and feedback events, comments central to the experience. Everything is self-serve. Good customer service.<p>Overall, Jango is still the best, but I've got high hopes for Earbits.",1341447191

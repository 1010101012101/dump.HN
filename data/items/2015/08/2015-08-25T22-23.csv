Old code has been used. It has been tested. Lots of bugs have been found, and they&#x27;ve been fixed. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. It doesn&#x27;t acquire bugs just by sitting around on your hard drive. Au contraire, baby! Is software supposed to be like an old Dodge Dart, that rusts just sitting in the garage?<p>> Back to that two page function. Yes, I know, it&#x27;s just a simple function to display a window, but it has grown little hairs and stuff on it and nobody knows why. Well, I&#x27;ll tell you why: those are bug fixes. One of them fixes that bug that Nancy had when she tried to install the thing on a computer that didn&#x27;t have Internet Explorer. Another one fixes that bug that occurs in low memory conditions. Another one fixes that bug that occurred when the file is on a floppy disk and the user yanks out the disk in the middle. That LoadLibrary call is ugly but it makes the code work on old versions of Windows 95.",1440543521

Each PLB entry has a start and stop offset so protection can be as granular as protecting one byte. In general, though, a single PLB entry will be quite large, covering the whole mapped region.<p>This seems orthogonal to the choice of PLB vs. TLB.  You could make a TLB with a start and stop offset if you really wanted to (though I suppose the increased size per entry would be problematic with TLBs needing to be faster than PLBs (which only need to be as fast as an l1 cache hit).<p>> The Mill address has a special bit to signify if it is a global address, or whether it is &quot;local&quot; to the process (using a special register which is XORed into the address). This allows the Mill to fork() and all the other things that traditionally have been hard on a SASOS.<p>Would shared-memory (in the unix sense) be considered global or local?  Would read-only text sections be marked global to improve fork performance?  I assume CoW is out-of-the-question for non-read-only sections and fork()?  If there&#x27;s a wiki page relating to fork, just point me to it :)<p>> We are porting Linux, and it will be Linux. Only a very very small part of the HAL will need to know anything Mill-specific :)<p>The feasibility of this seems obvious to me, as I&#x27;ve seen linux run other SAS platforms that are far more constrained than The Mill.",1440540805

I&#x27;d have thought it was a pretty uncontroversial claim that government agencies were funding anti-communist media organizations in the middle of the Cold War (when, let&#x27;s face it, they were doing it quite openly in many instances). I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised to they are doing something similar with moderate Islamic organizations and interfaith dialogue groups (not to mention many anodyne business ventures with roots in the Middle East) today.<p>But suggesting that censoring the anti-authoritarian playground that is Reddit or persuading Hacker Newsers of the virtues of the TSA are sufficiently high on their list of current national security priorities to dedicate manpower to in our current environment just seems... rather more of a stretch.<p>If they are attempting to astroturf these particular corners of the internet it&#x27;s something of an understatement to say they&#x27;re not very good at it.",1440540008

In Ryan's blog post itself, the following design choices can be questioned:<p>1. The balloon image just below the post title (and to the left of the number of comments) is not clickable. Should it be clickable? If so, should it lead to the comments section? Should it lead to the post-new-comment form?<p>2. To the right of the comment count, in the 'Latest by John Doe' part, again, no links. Even though 'John Doe' is a link in the original comment if he has a web page. If we linkify it, should both 'Latest' and 'John Doe' be links?<p>I am, of course, picking hairs like Ryan, but that's precisely the point - when you start picking hairs, there is more than one way to see it.",1231916380

433323,comment,432285,432818,0,0,lux,,,"I've actually been working on training myself to use one space, and it's a hard habit to change. I was taught to use two spaces by typing teachers, but was recently given a bit of a lesson from a friend who studies typography and designs his own fonts that the correct form is to use a single space.<p>Two spaces emerged as a convention for reasons mentioned in other posts here, and typing teachers in particular seem to have jumped on that bandwagon. However, the effect on rendered type is that it leaves unpleasant gaps in paragraphs in most popular programs (Word, etc.), and so the correct form according to typography professionals is apparently one space (or slightly more, but then that becomes a rendering issue, not one for the typist to decide). Since I have a huge appreciation for typography (albeit, not enough knowledge of the art itself), I feel it's worth correcting my habit.",1231915866

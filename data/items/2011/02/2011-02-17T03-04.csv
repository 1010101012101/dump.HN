The walled nature of EE limited its appeal to the largest part of the audience (the people looking for answers).  So although their business model was more direct, they were basing it on a smaller corpus, with fewer viewers.  An indirect (advertising-based) model over a much larger number of eyeballs could well make for a larger pie.<p>The challenge for SO is to see if they can maintain a high quality corpus as they scale, so people will keep producing and consuming their answers.",1297915177
2229677,comment,2228419,2229204,0,0,adriand,,,"> you gotta wonder where we'll be in say - 5 years from now?<p>Is it possible that the market won't coalesce and will instead stay fragmented?  I wonder about the likelihood of that happening.  It seems unlikely that either Android or iOS will capture 90% market share any time soon, plus, there is Blackberry to contend with (perhaps the Playbook will revive their fortunes somewhat) and you can never completely count out Microsoft either, as we've seen with the recent Nokia situation.<p>I think there are perhaps a couple of ways this could go.  First, regardless of who executes best on technology, there may be a company who executes best on earning money for developers, and this economic factor could really boost the platform - if developers start coalescing around a platform, consumers may (will?) follow.   (I think iOS has the edge here.)<p>Second, if the market remains fragmented it is going to be untenable for many companies, particularly small ones who develop software for clients, to support all of the platforms.  They'll either have to specialize in one, perhaps two, of the platforms and avoid or subcontract work for the other platforms, or they'll need to start relying more heavily on HTML5 and workarounds like Phonegap.  From that perspective, it may be in the best interest of web developers to see the platform fragmentation continue and perhaps get even worse.",1297915136

2229663,comment,2228419,2229057,0,0,akashs,,,"I think you're grossly underestimating how much 30% of revenues means.  Let's look at how this could actually affect you.  Lets forget for a second that Amazon is even part of this issue.  Let's stick to straight software development, what HN knows best.  Let's look at the profit margins of some of the best software companies:
<a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?catid=us-54399928&sort=ANIAC#link_Ann.%20Net%20Income"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/finance?catid=us-54399928&sort=ANI...</a><p>Look at what percentage of revenue that net income is, and count how many are above 30%.  Now, isn't it a bit more difficult to make money on a product if your 30% margin is gone?  Sure, Apple deserves some money for payment processing and distribution, maybe something for acquiring a new customer but certainly not 30% of all revenue.<p>Yes, you may say you can just raise price, right?  Well, to compensate you would have to raise price over 40%.  Meanwhile, the customers have already demonstrated the prices they are willing to bear, so that doesn't quite work.<p>So now, if you've started a business of developing iOS apps, you're severely hampered by this 30% revenue cut you're giving to Apple.  The small guys will probably deal with it because they won't know better, but think of it this way: Apple has just taxed 30% of the value you have created for your users.  That's 30% of your income.<p>You can argue this is a retail model and they should get a margin the same way you do if you sell something through Best Buy, but it becomes anticompetitive when they've blocked off any option you have to sell directly to a customer or through any other channel.  The companies on that list do very little business through retail, and they would suffer if they had to give up 30%.  Moreover, Apple's own margins would take a hit if they had to sell everything through a retail partner.<p>(Also don't get why it matters that Rhapsody, Netflix, Amazon don't create content.  Apple doesn't create most of the stuff that goes into an iPhone, but that doesn't mean they don't add value and shouldn't be able to make money)",1297914735

I would have loved more women to be alums giving advice, but only because they might be able to better answer gender-oriented questions from a first-person perspective.  Saying the event should have only female alums, and then implying that the men did not view you as a peer because of some gender issue rather than the context of the event, is borderline offensive to me.<p>When I'm put in the situation of giving advice as a YC alum, I do just that: I give advice.

(That's the thing about crime, as all the good dime novels say: Once you do the first one it just leads to another.)<p>I'm no lawyer, let alone a real estate lawyer, so I can't refute this to the extent that it probably deserves. But some things even I understand: If Bank A lent money to a customer, and then Bank A sold the mortgage to Bank B without properly transferring the paperwork (according to the very well established law concerning such things), and then Bank B sold that mortgage upstream to Bank C, and then Bank C sold Investor D a security that is ""backed by actual mortgages""... <i>someone</i> committed fraud. Either Bank B lied to Bank C by selling something that they did not own, or Bank C happily paid Bank B for a thing that was <i>not</i>, legally speaking, a properly transferred mortgage (""Bank B hereby sells this IOU, written on a Post-It note, to Bank C"") but then claimed to its investors that it actually owned <i>mortgages</i>. Post-It notes are not mortgages.<p>What is happening today is that the Bank Cs of the world, who are on the hook to their investors to pay off those supposedly ""mortgage-backed"" securities, are foreclosing on houses to try and recoup some money. But Bank C doesn't actually own the houses because someone messed up the paperwork. So they wave the Post-It notes around with <i>great energy</i>, committing more fraud and perjury (and stupid mistakes) in the process, and hope that nobody gets prosecuted.<p>EDIT: Note: these are not just alleged crimes, they seem like <i>seriously embarrassing</i> alleged crimes. They lost the papers! What a rookie mistake! If only they'd been a little less sloppy this wouldn't have happened!<p>But, once again: Where there is one crime there may well be others. It's quite possible that this level of sloppiness and fraud was not allowed to go on just by accident. It may well have served to disguise other frauds, like (e.g.) effectively selling a mortgage more than once as part of different securities.",1297911931

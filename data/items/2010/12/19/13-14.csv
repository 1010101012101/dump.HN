The usual rule of thumb was that you probably should have published 3 decent papers in that time.<p>The ""3 years"" came from the length of time the standard PhD student was funded for - there was no guarantee that you would finish within the three years.

2021634,comment,2020928,2021354,0,0,wallflower,,,"IntelliJ is expensive. IntelliJ makes refactoring simple. For example, we got acquired by a company and were forced to rename our com.origcompany to com.newcompany. In one project that was several thousand class files. IntelliJ did it in about a minute. Eclipse crashed somewhere after twenty minutes. I actually had to use Eclipse because Flex Builder would only run on Eclipse Ganymede. I lost many minutes of my life waiting for Flex Builder to build. I don't know if that was a consequence of Flex Builder's mxmlc performance but I do know that Eclipse completely froze on our Windows machines a few times a day. For a team trying to get a app done, we unofficially acknowledged that Eclipse was an impediment. The major drawbacks to IntelliJ is that Git support is poor. I would recommend just doing stuff from the command line for Git. We use SVN. My general feeling with IntelliJ is that it is a very polished product that I've been using since 2000 (before that we used the awesome Visual Slickedit). In Eclipse, I found that simple stuff that you may do often isn't optimized (for example, reference or string searching) - in IntelliJ it is cached. In Eclipse, searching always took forever (I should have attempted to look for a searching plugin). My best analogy is that IntelliJ is a BMW and Eclipse is a minivan. Both work, one is better performance and more tuned. One is feature rich.",1292765493

2021606,comment,2020626,2020741,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Thanks for your reply.  Because of my current concerns (referenced below) I find it useful to get opinions and comments from people whose names I recognise on HN.<p>To answer your specific question, DupDetector was an attempt at two things.<p>Firstly, to separate concerns - to separate my ""curating"" efforts of cross-referencing and duplicate finding from my occasional contributions of original material and links.  I wanted to see the effects of that activities separately.  In particular, I wanted people look at my ""submissions"" page from my profile to see the submissions, not the cross-referencing.<p>Secondly, to make the process more comprehensive and more automatic.  I wrote a few small scripts and had them generate comments.  I <i>never</i> let it run automatically, and always submitted them ""by hand"".  That meant that they weren't as obviously robotic as I would eventually have intended them to be.  I have also written a couple of comments and submitted them under that ID because that was part of the separation of concerns mentioned above.<p>I've learned a lot from the experiment, and over time I will distill that and feed it back to the community.

2021602,comment,2019822,2020900,0,0,mahmud,,,"I would love to see evidence of Dijkstra's critique of Pascal (which is NOT a basic dialect.)<p>Dijkstra hates Basic, Fortran, Cobol and APL .. but not Pascal. He wrote an Algol compiler and used Algol-based languages and formalisms throughout his entire career, even inventing some himself.<p>The reason is simple: Pascal is hard to hate (or love for that matter.) It's a reliable 4-door, automatic sedan.",1292763747

I'm curious, because I read how this score is calculated and it's supposedly the average of the person's last comments - only in my case it can't be. Other people don't seem to have this ""problem"", does that mean my account is flagged somehow? Or is it in truth the average of only the first comments when an account is fresh and then stays the same forever?",1292763613

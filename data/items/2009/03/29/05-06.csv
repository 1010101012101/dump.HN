Even ignoring the fact that Google <i>et al.</i> love to hire CS PhDs, I can guarantee that anyone who has had the persistence to make it through a PhD in an analytical discipline has skills a lot more valuable than the ability to make a resume in LaTeX.  Yet another example of short-sighted anti-intellectualism by software nerds.",1238304802

Are you going to figure out Kreb's cycle from first principles?  Will you deduce the results of the Civil War based on it's causes?<p>If it was limited to subjects where students could study the evidence and come to their own conclusions, school would quickly end up being useless...",1238303829
537137,comment,537109,537117,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Thanks for beating me to make the same point. There is an astonishing lack of careful validation studies of many kinds of ""scientific"" evidence often referred to in criminal trials. Basically, the ""expert"" gets on the witness stand, says what the prosecutor wants said, and it's a rare defense attorney who has the resources to offer rebuttal evidence on the same issue.<p>The common-law rule of handwriting identification is that it doesn't require special expertise, but only familiarity with someone's handwriting. In other words, even though I don't purport to have any specialized training in handwriting identification, I could (if the case required such evidence) be called to testify, ""Yeah, that looks like my wife's handwriting; I've seen hundreds of examples of things she has written, and this looks just her usual handwriting."" You could do the same for anyone whose handwriting is familiar to you.",1238303638

But after getting involved in open source and working with people better than me, surprise, I got pretty good.<p>""What you'll wish you'd known"" has hit the front page again, and is my favorite of Paul's essays because of the bits about how it's a lot of work to become good.<p>Now, I don't know Lars, the guy that wrote this engine, but I am old friends with Harri, the guy who wrote the one he was replacing (KJS, original KHTML / WebKit JS engine) and he's smart, but not intimidatingly smart.<p>Open source developers tend to be some of the best hackers; I know since I've worked with them and I've worked many years full time as a commercial software developer.  But the open source hackers don't join the projects as great hackers; they start as mediocre hackers that want to do something cool, and with enough cojones to take getting flamed when they screw up in stride and learn from it.  Give that process a couple years, and poof, way above average programming ability.",1238303499

537133,comment,536181,537004,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Sometimes an example can go a long way. I grew up in another state than the one my maternal grandparents lived in, but I did travel to join their sixtieth wedding anniversary celebration with most of my thirty-four cousins. That's surely helped me and my wife (whose parents have also been married six decades now) stay together for more than twenty-five years. She and I grew up in different countries, speaking different native languages and eating different foods, and have changed radically from our former selves over the years, but we are still each other's best friends.",1238303333
537132,comment,536718,536850,0,0,Zev,,,"I haven't had any professor in an upper level (300 or 400) class expect anyone to take in what they say as absolute truth. They usually welcome students questions as an opportunity for discussion. The only times they don't seem to is when trying to cover something new and someone doesn't want to move on.<p>In lower level courses, where straight up lectures are more common, professors are more inclined to simply teach the facts instead of trying to create a(n unmanageable) discussion between 50+ people. Which is understandable. And they (usually, at the beginning of the semester, at least) stress that they have office hours or are available at other times if someone wants to continue talking about a topic for whatever reason.<p>But these are my experiences, maybe I've just been lucky?",1238303311

It was just after reading a couple of Feynmann books, which is why I can so eloquently classify handwriting analysis as a ""cargo cult science.""<p>It's a lot about ""energy"" and ""flow"" and other subjective nonsense.  It's along the lines of reading body language... which I would call more of a skill, or talent, rather than a science.",1238302821

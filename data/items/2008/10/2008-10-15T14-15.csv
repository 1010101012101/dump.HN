For the two summers, this was not a problem.  I took the same approach for my year long stay.<p>However, after month 4 or 5, I totally burned out.  I was spending all week and all weekend speaking Japanese, which I was improving at a lot, but still required a lot more mental effort than speaking English.  Beyond that, there are just lots of little cultural things to always be mindful of and this added a small but constant burden, too.<p>It was at this time that I started attending an English speaking church, attended by ex-pats.  One thing I discovered was that, even if the person was Taiwanese and we were speaking Japanese because that was the one common language between us, we still agreed on the same things that were weird about Japan.<p>Having this support group made a world of difference.  I was still in a Japanese environment, spending most days speaking mostly Japanese, but I had an outlet.<p>I suspect this is what women get from having female connections in the CS/programming world.  As much as our society sometimes tries to ignore the fact, men and women are different enough that it is occasionally necessary to get away from the other culture and retreat into your own, even if only to hear someone agree about how weird the other culture can be.",1224081171

I've never had a problem communicating with them, or felt uncomfortable voicing my opinion.  I suppose that's different, though, than having the coworkers mostly female, too.<p>Mind you, I am not saying that I have any complaints about my own experience.  The women in question have been good bosses, and mostly have let me use my own judgment in deciding how to complete the tasks assigned to me.  For those of us programming as an employee, for the most part I think this is all we really want.<p>Maybe this is why I have a hard time accepting programs that seek to pump indifferent women into computer science/programming fields.  I can't relate to the idea that women are discriminated against in this field when, more often than not, it has been a woman telling me what to do.  For what it's worth, most of these women seemed more than happy to let others do the implementation and make technical decisions, while they focused more on the parts of the work that require human interaction.  This is not to say that they did not understand the technical questions or were incapable of doing the implementation, just that it did not seem to interest them as strongly as the inter-personal aspects.<p>Having said that, I don't have any objections to this program being offered to help women entrepreneurs.

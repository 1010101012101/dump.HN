One of the issues is that the basecalling algorithm relies on a noisy, two bit signal. Apparently it works okay on trained sequences, like lambda DNA (that&#x27;s where the 60-85% accuracy comes from). But when used to sequence untrained DNA, the accuracy drops off significantly (<10% accuracy, <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.12324/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.12324/a...</a>).<p>There is lot&#x27;s of room for improvement though. All of the commercial nanopore tech is based on biological nanopores, which have the advantage of having very straight-forward to fabricate. But they are limited to the ionic current signal, which is very noisy and weak. Once these companies start introducing solid-state devices though, things will begin to get very interesting as alternative signal transduction mechanisms come into play.",1410961438

AppleScript had so many never-fixed areas where bugs in the underlying implementation produced nonsensical error messages (e.g. `A scripting error has occurred: Can&#x27;t make «class ppth» into a «class ppth»`) which required you to get out a debugger to figure out what was really going on.

I am really hesitant to say this, considering the moral implications but this is unavoidable: young attractive, impressionable interns. Female will usually work best, but you can&#x27;t be certain. Some days an unusual bait will outfish everything so don&#x27;t discount young men or other non traditional choices. Avoid over the top and extroverted beauty. An understated, geeky 23 year old brunette with a tendency to wide eyed admiration is a good, safe choice. Interns are available at affordable prices at your nearest University.<p>Once you&#x27;ve baited your hook, approach slowly. Ask questions. Advice.  Try to use pose interesting challenges.

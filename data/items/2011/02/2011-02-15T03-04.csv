I'm guessing that many of you were born well after that point, and have grown up your whole lives with this mythology about Jobs.<p>It's a load of bunk.  Jobs is charismatic, but he found early on that due to his charisma, reporters liked to tell tall tales about him. Always looking for the ""human interest"" side of things, or something to spice up their reporting they'd exaggerate.  So he stopped giving interviews, figuring that would give them less to work with, and in doing so he overestimated their integrity.  Instead they quickly figured out he wouldn't give them the additional attention of debunking them, so they just started spreading whatever rumor or gossip or fabrications sounded good.<p>Jonathan Schwartz is not a reporter, but he can say whatever he wants, knowing that Jobs is not going to waste time disproving it.  Doing so only brings more attention to the faux controversy.<p>And of course, Apple haters, who really don't need much prompting anyway, will simply take it as the gospel truth.<p>I'm sure Apple's right and attempting to point out this is just silly, because those who believe will believe anyway because they want to.<p>Look at Job's stanford commencement speech.

Unlike trademarks, the owner of a patent doesn't lose it if they don't enforce it, and also unlike patents, the patent holder can choose to <i>selectively</i> enforce/seek damages from infringing parties.  Does a company with as much market penetration and power as Apple really feel threatened by open source projects such that they need to threaten them with lawsuits, meanwhile not feeling threatened enough by them to use open source software?  Patent holders, including Apple, could take the high road and say ""While we own these patents, we're not going to attack or threaten open source products that use our patents because 1) we benefit from open source 2) we still have the advantage even if our competitors use the open source product that is using our patented technology"".

The speed increase occurring in this maneuver may be calculated if reliable or conservative aerodynamic data is used. Power as specified in §25.175(b)(1)(iv) is assumed until the pullup is initiated, at which time power reduction and the use of pilot controlled drag devices may be assumed;<p>(2) The minimum speed margin must be enough to provide for atmospheric variations (such as horizontal gusts, and penetration of jet streams and cold fronts) and for instrument errors and airframe production variations. These factors may be considered on a probability basis. The margin at altitude where MCis limited by compressibility effects must not less than 0.07M unless a lower margin is determined using a rational analysis that includes the effects of any automatic systems. In any case, the margin may not be reduced to less than 0.05M.<p>Vc is the maximum operating airspeed and Mc is the maximum operating Mach number. Vd is the dive speed and Md is the dive Mach number.

As some background, I've been working as a PHP developer for the last year or so. Before that, I had no programming experience, although I've always been fairly technical. I got a Microsoft certification my Freshman year of High School.<p>I've been through fairly great pains to educate myself though, and shortly after I started programming for a living, I picked up SICP and read through it and did all of the exercises. It greatly improved my skills, and since then I've digested a good number of programming books. While I feel I have a strong theoretical background (ish), I've not taken on any major projects. Most of the work I've done over this last year has been maintenance on an already completed accounting/shipping/receiving etc... system. I haven't had too much time to pursue projects other than working through books like SICP and a few other textbooks like ""Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer programming"" as I am also a full time student as well as a competitive pianist. I was also working full time.<p>Financially, I am neither in a good place or bad. I already freelance successfully, and even without my full time job, on average my freelancing covers about 1.5 times my monthly expenses (about 800 dollars.) I'll have a few grand set aside when I leave at the end of this month.<p>I have some experience using several frameworks and have implemented trivial projects in Django, Rails and Seaside.

I think I'm competent, but a lot of people don't seem to be willing to give me a fair shake because of my age, or aren't willing to compensate me fairly. (I don't make outrageous demands). As an example, I was being paid less than 15 dollars an hour to do full time web development. I was happy with this because the environment was great, I had an office, dual monitors and a beast of a machine, so I felt pretty taken care of.<p>I guess my dilemma is this.

In the early 8-bit era this was particularly true because of technical limitations; from around the advent of 16-bit consoles on, the default became ""generic action-game gameplay that is visually similar to the IP."" The main thing that has changed since then is the kind of generic gameplay used - at first it was almost always platform games; nowadays third-person action-adventures tend to be the default. The inclusion of mock-Japanese elements is mostly a reflection of the NES in particular, but games from the U.S. and U.K., on other platforms, tended to be wacky too, just not as much(probably because the licensors were more hands-on about the content of the game).<p>Some examples(some bad games, and some really good ones too):<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFVEtVEYtBw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFVEtVEYtBw</a>

But at the same time, some IP-holders will get obnoxiously protective of the brand image, take a ""merchandising tie-in"" view of the game that blinds them to other sources of value, and as such are willing to cut large amounts of the game out for the sake of making it fit into their vision. When this happens it can be very discouraging for both parties.<p>Here's an example of a real game license that I worked on a pitch for(never went into production): Michael Phelps. It was the most perplexing thing. What the fuck do you do in a Michael Phelps game? The publisher had come up with two concepts to work from - generic action-adventure(Phelps...swims very fast...to save the day from terrorists?) or generic party game(lots of swimming minigames with Michael Phelps in them?).<p>This was shortly after the stories came out about his pot-smoking habits, so one idea we desperately wanted to put into the concept, if it weren't so obviously un-befitting of brand image, would be to do the action-adventure but turn it into a parody and have him ""power up"" with bong rips and enter bonus stages where he's literally swimming in the clouds. With this simple change, the license does a 180 in terms how much novel/interesting gameplay can be had from it.",1297740190

2219974,comment,2214690,2218199,0,0,Mz,,,"Your assumption is correct:  I was basically a homemaker my entire marriage.<p>I lived in the same house from age 3 until I got married.  Moving to a new place the first time was a big shock for me.  Unfortunately, my husband was not at all helpful or supportive even though he had moved around quite a lot as a kid.  We got married, then he joined the army and after he got out of basic training, we moved about 900 miles away to a new place.  So this was really the first time either of us had been away from our parents.  He promptly began behaving like a lot of first-year college students who are away from their parents for the first time:  He was self-indulgent, selfish and irresponsible. Then I turned up pregnant shortly after we got there.  I was very sick with my first pregnancy.  And we had serious financial problems, in part because we bought an expensive vehicle while he was in basic training with the idea that we would both have jobs and no kids for a few years.  This was a big, big mistake that dogged us the rest of our marriage.  We had chronic financial problems that we never did resolve, in part due to that initial decision and in part because he really didn't learn from that mistake and in some sense repeated it (over my objections) with our second vehicle (while convincing himself we were on the same page because I eventually threw my hands up and stopped fighting with him over it).<p>I liked getting to see the world on terms that made sense for me.  I am unable to wrap my brain around why people go on ""vacations"" (short visits somewhere to do something I find utterly meaningless like lay on the beach) but I really liked living in different places for a couple of years or so at a time, in part because you get to know the area in a way that you can't possibly learn in just a week or two -- the local customs, pronunciations, differences in so many things like shopping and food and climate and why the architecture is so different.  Nonetheless, we would start our ""to-do-and-see"" list as soon as we knew where we were going and we lived like perpetual tourists.  (Many military families don't start doing the tourist-y stuff until they have orders to leave and suddenly realize they might not ever see the place again.)  We pretty much used every long weekend or other time off to go sight-seeing at local stuff (until my health crisis put a stop to that).  Regardless of how far down the list we got, we were usually pretty content with how much we had done by the time we left again. My kids saw so many zoos, aquariums, etc that when we took them to an aquarium in San Francisco, they were quick to announce it was ""lame"" and ""boring"" and ask ""can we go yet??""  This in spite of our chronic financial problems and basically living on one income the entire time.<p>One really good thing:  I had real privacy in my marriage and my kids found stereotypical ugly in-law jokes baffling.  They just couldn't relate because we didn't live near any of our relatives.  Having real privacy was a tremendous help to a chronically troubled marriage. It is part of why the marriage lasted as long as it did and part of why the divorce was extremely amicable. I have relatives who had attempts on their lives while divorcing so my amicable divorce is quite the novelty for my extended family.  One relative, who was nearly killed during their divorce, told me bluntly that I was a fool to trust my ex to the degree that I did.  So there is no doubt in my mind that had we not been far away from relatives and had we not had real privacy for our marriage, things would have been much, much, much uglier, both during the marriage and during the divorce.<p>My first conversation with my ex husband when we were 16 years old was an argument. We never did stop arguing, even though years later he admitted to me he picked that first argument as a means to talk to a pretty girl.  He was very bad about not being able to let go of an argument and would follow me around and harangue me, while I tried to walk away and give us both a cooling off period.  At some point during the divorce I finally said in exasperation ""The only time I have your undivided attention is the one time I desperately wish you would go back to ignoring me like you usually do.""  After that he was finally able to just walk away.  The fact that the only time he really gave me his attention was while arguing with me was extremely corrosive to the marriage.  Over time, there just stopped being any positive experiences in the marriage.  When we would agree to set aside time for each other, he always felt compelled to fill that time with household chores and errands.  So he still was unable to actually pay attention to me, even during times that we had agreed to block out as ""together time"".  We also couldn't get on the same page financially and he was extraordinarily poor at making me feel loved.  (I have at times said that I got pretty much everything I wanted out of my marriage except a feeling of being loved.)  These problems would have destroyed the marriage no matter where we lived.  The fact that I got to go to new and interesting places was one of the good things about the marriage, not one of the bad things.<p>When he got orders for Southern California, he tried desperately to get out of it.  He told me ""There is nothing there.  You will divorce me."" I eventually told him to stop fighting it and just accept the assignment, that it would be fine.  It turned out to be one of the most cherished places we lived, for all four of us.  He even tried to extend his assignment so we could stay longer.  That request was not granted.<p>Just be a good husband.  You can do that any place.  And being a bad husband will ruin your marriage no matter where you live.<p>Peace and good luck.",1297739749

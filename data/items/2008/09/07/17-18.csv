This evolution has changed the role of the browser into an operating system rather than a simple document renderer. Unlike current browsers, Chromium is built like an operating system to run these applications in a safe and robust way, using multiple OS processes to isolate web sites from each other and from the browser itself.""",1220810256

But the whole thing went nowhere.\nChrome will probably never be able to do 3D, or very intense computing tasks,  so I think the OS is still here to stay.",1220810110

297597,comment,297297,297370,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> Do you get the sense that everyone in the web world knows that desktop apps aren't going anywhere?<p>When I worked at a company doing enterprise financial software, I got the distinct impression that it was virtually impossible to sell a <i>new</i> desktop app.  Our customers wanted everything to be web-based.  I was hired as a desktop app developer and got switched over to web development after 8 months because all our new products were web-based.<p>I suspect that we'll see something similar to what happened with PCs and mainframes.  The PC didn't kill the mainframe - all the old apps that used to run on mainframes still ran on mainframes.  However, all <i>new</i> software, the category-killers that created new markets, were all developed on the PC.  Mainframes stuck around for years before finally being killed by Y2K and web-based intranet apps, and some are still working.<p>Similarly, I think any attempt to displace office suites and such on the web is a losing battle.  PC-based apps are ""good enough"" for what they're used for.  But virtually all new killer apps, the ones with exciting market opportunities, will be on the web.  Or they'll be web/desktop hybrids like DropBox, RescueTime, or BitTorrent, in cases where the app needs some local data that the browser can't provide.<p>Then PC apps will finally be killed by whatever new thick client ends up replacing the web, but we've got a while (maybe 10-20 years) before that happens.",1220808508

297584,comment,297297,297513,0,0,blasdel,,,"<i>WRONG</i><p>I think most of this 'WebOS' bullshit was kicked off by web-dilettante Jason Kottke, and it's even more ridiculous this time around, because Chrome is the least OS-like modern web browser yet made (and Firefox would be the most OS-like by far).<p>Chrome is not trying to be the operating system, it's trying to get out of its way. By using a shared-nothing separate process for each tab and plugin, it's letting\nthe Kernel and libc do the job they were designed to do.<p>Most modern browsers (especially FF3) are trying to do an operating system's job — scheduling logically independent processes, micro-managing memory allocations, mapping virtual memory, providing an internal windowing system, providing an internal GUI scripting system. The whole point of an 'operating system' is to present a lot of layers.<p>Chrome does none of these things. It parries them off to the real operating system, where they belong — instead of adding another five nested layers on top of the pile of indirection.",1220807136

That cost just doesn't really take into account the fact that tech startups are so incredibly low cost to create now.<p>In YC, we created companies for < $15k, with plenty of money to spare. There is no way we would ever spend that much money on a launch.<p>Though I think in the long run, Arrington/TC has not a whole lot to worry about. It's a pretty obvious value prop -- the smart startups will end up going to the one that matters that is free for startups, and the ones who get rejected will end up at DEMO.<p>DEMO is subject to the same competitive pressures as startups.

7782190,comment,7781596,7782097,42,0,burntsushi,,,"I grant that your questions are probably rhetorical, but I&#x27;ll take a shot at them anyway.<p>While I was writing Rust&#x27;s regex crate, I became very familiar with Russ Cox&#x27;s work on implementing a regex engine with worst case O(mn) time complexity (m ~ regex and n ~ search text). As far as I know, he has two implementations of these ideas: RE2 (C++) and Go&#x27;s regexp package. RE2 is extremely sophisticated. It includes a full NFA simulation (known as the &quot;Pike VM&quot;) that can find submatches, and it also includes a DFA that avoids repeating work (but cannot find submatches). The DFA is very very fast (and I believe is multithreaded). The NFA simulation isn&#x27;t as fast and is only used when necessary.<p>Go&#x27;s regexp package only includes a full NFA simulation. There is no speedy DFA. My guess is that this is the primary reason why it is slow. (I will, however, note that Go 1.3 will include a reasonably large optimization which introduces a &quot;one-pass&quot; NFA simulation. It&#x27;s used when it can be proven that the regex will never need to backtrack. Rob Pike posted some benchmarks on golang-dev a while back, and they showed a perf improvement in the regexp package. So they at least seem to be working on things that you care about.)<p>Speaking from a higher level, I&#x27;d say that the raw performance of regexes is probably not a huge priority. Needing wickedly fast regexes seems like a special case to me, in which case, you might just use an existing library to do it via cgo. (And indeed, the benchmark&#x27;s game includes some Go benchmarks that use the PCRE C library, which has more reasonable performance.)<p>For more details on how it all works, Russ has written an <i>amazing</i> series of articles on the topic: <a href=""http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/</a><p>> Why does encoding/json still rely on reflection, making it slow compared to other approaches?<p>Using reflection makes encoding/decoding JSON extraordinarily convenient. I do the same with TOML[1], although admittedly, performance is less of an issue there. My suspicion is that the added complexity for when you need raw speed isn&#x27;t common enough to be in the standard library. megajson[2] tries to fill this hole, but it&#x27;s a code generation tool, so you may find that less than ideal.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://github.com/benbjohnson/megajson"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/benbjohnson/megajson</a>",1400734769

The page you link generates more efficient Go code, however it comes at the price of being more brittle.  I&#x27;ve used standard library json package for things like reading a config file, where the time difference isn&#x27;t noticeable.

A group protects its own members even when they&#x27;re corrupt or extreme. Members slowly become extreme or corrupt because members of that group do not self criticize. Because to criticize one&#x27;s group means attacking your own people and possibly being exiled. So groups turn extreme and corrupt over time</i>)<p>HN is battling the same problems and political extremism that we fled from at Reddit and Digg (which both used to be tech / startupish communities). I personally remember the very first page of Digg and Reddit back when there were no sub-reddits, and was one of those who fled both during their downfall.<p>The pattern is the same. The communities were made up of extremely intelligent moderates from a wide spectrum of political and ideological beliefs. We had moderate liberals, conservatives, independents, libertarians, and plenty of others. The comments were insanely intelligent. I have an entire folder of screenshots of comments saved for reading on a rainy day, that&#x27;s how good they were. They were thought provoking and unbelievably fresh. Even if an idea was controversial, people listened and debated intelligently. They talked about the problem first before they offered a solution.<p>Then things little by little starting leaning left, got political, racial and genderized. Political solutions were thrown at problems before the problem was even understood. The communities saw an influx of new members who were extremely liberal. Not moderate liberal, extremely left-wing liberal. Digg and especially Reddit went down the drain when they had an influx of extreme liberals and the moderate liberals left. It brought out the worst in the community from members both new and old. Myself included. When others get more extreme with their ideas, you get more extreme with yours in order to counter balance them.<p>Same is now happened with HN:<p>- There&#x27;s a ton more downvoting of ideas that people disagree with.<p>- Old HN only downvoted comments that didn&#x27;t add to the conversation. New HN downvotes comments that are politically incorrect.<p>- Old HN had less comments but were of a higher quality. New HN increasingly has days where there are 200 to 300+ comments on many of the submissions, most of them garbage.<p>- There are less and less &quot;Show HN&quot; and &quot;Ask HN&quot; threads making it to the front page. A lot less than we had before.<p>- Less talk of hacking things together and building startups.<p>- More off topic stories about &quot;disproportionate barbies&quot;, &quot;race and segregation&quot;, &quot;ship cats&quot;, &quot;3D tea kettles&quot;, &quot;dark spots under a fighter jet&quot;.<p>- Comments that racialize, class-ify, and genderize problems. Often talking about race/gender/class problems in places where they don&#x27;t belong or don&#x27;t even exist. A few weeks back we had all those articles about gentrification of San Francisco and almost all of the articles were blaming &quot;white male tech workers&quot; even though 50% of tech workers turn out to be Asian. This is what I mean by racializing topics. Trying to find race/gender issues in every problem.<p>- Low quality members encourage low quality content from everyone. When you see others doing it, you start doing it to. I admit I have posted garbage comments a lot myself. It&#x27;s a domino effect.<p>The Good News:<p>- It&#x27;s not constant. It comes in waves. There are days like today where almost everything on the front page is on-topic, good quality with no more than 50 or so comments. Other days there&#x27;s a ton of garbage on the front page with 200 - 300+ comments.<p>- Paul Graham and Ycombinator run HN and have the incentive to keep it focused and the culture moderate and sane.<p>Most people here won&#x27;t say anything about it.

Let&#x27;s look at the wicked lasers arctic, a popular (but low quality) 445nm blue laser with a power output of up to 2000mW. This is one of the more powerful consumer handheld lasers out there.<p>Wicked claims a divergence of 1.5mRad. I think that&#x27;s optimistic. It&#x27;s probably really above 2 mRad.<p>Let&#x27;s say you get within 300 meters of a plane. That&#x27;s pretty tricky; you&#x27;d be lucky to do that even near an airport (and the closer you are to an airport, the easier it is to get arrested.<p>At 300 meters, the beam is (very optimistically) about 450mm. Because of the multimode properties of the 445nm diode, even with this very optimistic spec, it&#x27;s probably more like a 1m x .45m ellipse. But let&#x27;s just assume a circle.<p>pi<i>.45</i>.45 = .63 meters squared.<p>That&#x27;s a power density of 2W/.63m^2, or about .00037W/cm^2.<p>According to the IEC and SPIE, that&#x27;s a low enough power density that at visible wavelengths, you could be exposed to it for long periods with no eye damage. [1][2]<p>This is assuming ideal conditions, including a perfect beam, no atmospheric interference, and no reflection/filtering on the aircraft.<p>There is no physical danger to the pilot; the risk is that the pilot gets distracted. This risk is not substantial, as it&#x27;s very difficult to keep a laser trained at a pilot long enough to be dangerously distracting, and you have to be very close for the laser light to even be noticeable.<p>By the way; There are a few videos floating around of lasers shining into cockpits. Most of these look really bad, because A)they filmed with the intention of making lasers look dangerous and B)lasers saturate camera CCDs very easily, so they can look incredibly bright on video even if our eyes handle them pretty well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IEC60825_MPE_W_s.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IEC60825_MPE_W_s.png</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://spie.org/Documents/Publications/00%20STEP%20Module%2002.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spie.org/Documents/Publications/00%20STEP%20Module%20...</a>",1400732837

7782072,comment,7781846,7781846,5,0,dredmorbius,,,"This appears to be a very narrow degree of access, though there are some attempts to make it more liberal:<p>&quot;The Museum&#x27;s OASC initiative provides license- and cost-free access to images of artwork in the collection that the Museum believes to be in the public domain and free of other known restrictions for scholarly use in any media...<p>&quot;What is scholarly content?<p>&quot;Scholarly content encompasses scholarly publication in all media and is defined here as the dissemination of ideas and knowledge derived from study or research for educational/cultural purposes....  Scholarly publication is not limited to academic institutions or university publishers, since commercial publishers/entities may also produce scholarly publications. Scholarly publication is not restricted by print run. <i>For the purposes of the Museum&#x27;s license-free Open Access for Scholarly Content (OASC), users are encouraged to make their own assessment.</i> However, all users must carefully review this website&#x27;s Terms and Conditions prior to downloading or using images or any materials on this website.<p>&quot;What are some examples of scholarly content?<p>&quot;All school and academic work (including theses, dissertations, etc.), conference proceedings, journal articles, essays in Festschrifts, museum exhibition catalogues, non-commercially produced textbooks and educational materials, books published by university presses or the academic/scholarly imprint of commercial publishers, self-published books, and documentary films. All of these examples apply to scholarly publication in any media format (print, electronic, film, etc.).&quot;<p>Note that this doesn&#x27;t specifically include blogs, though &quot;self-published books&quot; tends to suggest they are included.  However:<p>&quot;What is not scholarly content?<p>&quot;Commercial use, publication, or distribution in any media or format is not scholarly content. Some examples include: commercially published general-interest books in print or electronic media; all products, merchandise, (including posters, calendars, notecards, datebooks, mugs, etc.), advertisements, or promotional materials for any services or products in any media format; feature films or documentaries funded by commercial organizations.&quot;<p>While I can appreciate the desire to prevent untrammeled commercial use, this creates a fairly considerable area of ambiguity.  Would a beaker incorporating an image be considered scholarly use?  An academic group using an image in a presentation?  For conference signage?  For a conference shirt?  Does the consideration change if the shirts are included in registration or sold separately?<p>How about images used in a scholarly work which is then cited, referenced, quoted, or included in a &quot;general interest&quot; publication?<p>In previous licensing developments, attempts have been made to distinguish &quot;commercial&quot; from &quot;noncommercial&quot; use.  The boundaries have generally proven less than clear.  In particular, they tend to discourage further use of works under such licenses.<p>One alternative is to distinguish use of images with other marks of the Museum in use.  The Debian Project draws this distinction:  the entire distribution is available free of charge, and there are a set of logos which are <i>similarly</i> free to be used.  There is <i>also</i> a set of restricted logos which may be used <i>only</i> by the Debian Project itself (or others to whom it&#x27;s specifically licensed).<p>A converse of this would be to <i>require</i> that an attribution or logo be included in all uses of the images.  In effect the images then become additional advertising and publicity for the Museum.  Of course, one risk becomes use of images in contexts for which the Museum may not wish to be associated (political content, sexually explicit uses, violent or other uses).<p>Another approach would be to limit the quality of images available.  Even fairly high-quality online images tend not to be applicable to, say, high-quality hardcopy replication.<p>The fact that many of the works depicted in the images are themselves far outside copyright protection only further muddies the situation.",1400732217

If you can infringe a patent by accident having never heard of the patent holder or their so-called invention, that should be pretty strong evidence that the patent is excessively abstract or claiming something obvious. But that&#x27;s the entire patent troll business model. There are zero people going through their inscrutable patent applications to find inventions to use and then infringing them on purpose. If you got rid of all the bad software patents there would be hardly anything left. Because hardly anybody infringes on purpose so nobody even bothers to apply for software patents that no one would infringe by accident.<p>I think it&#x27;s the nature of the field.

I built a data science team in Singapore for a two year old company, and out of the 6 people here, we have 5 nationalities (FR, UK, US, DE x 2, VN). All the visas were approved in a day or two. No Singaporeans - the whole team was imported (5 more work remotely). No Australians, either - 2% of applicants came from there but none made the cut so far.<p>Now let&#x27;s imagine that I, as a non-Singaporean citizen or PR, wanted to start a business and was choosing between Singapore and Sydney. Both countries have an entrepreneur visa of sorts. That&#x27;s my primary consideration - all the talent I know is foreign as far as both countries are concerned. I&#x27;m an entrepreneur, so I don&#x27;t care that much for tax rates (if it was absolute dollars I wanted, I&#x27;d stay in corporate). From a quality of life perspective, Sydney wins. SEA and Australia are similar markets in terms of potential revenue - only 60 million people are connected in SEA (10% of the population) and order values are much smaller, so potential balances out.<p>In Singapore, I just need to raise 75,000 SGD and then apply for matched SPRING funding with a 7 page form.

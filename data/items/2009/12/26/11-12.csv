1015901,comment,1015879,1015879,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I got started when I was in my early teens, most of it in a local computer store (where the salespeople would let me play with stuff I couldn't afford as long as I would explain to the customers what it could do).<p>As for your second question, I wished I had learned about 'structured programming' earlier, that would have saved me a couple of years. But then again, learning it only after a few years of 'spaghetti basic' definitely made me appreciate it more :)<p>Best of luck, it's going to take you some time but you'll be glad you did it, the ability to program computers isn't going to make you smarter per-se but it will give you an amazing new tool to help with all kinds of other things. The net result is very close to actually being smarter. It's like being able to use a powertool.<p>Jacques",1261827836

1015892,comment,1015311,1015651,0,0,ddfreyne,,,"When I wrote nanoc about two and a half years ago, webby, staticmatic, jekyll, … did not exist, and I was looking for a way to publish a web site on a VPS with very limited resources.<p>I didn’t find anything that fit my needs. There were only very few static site compilers back then, so I decided to write my own (yes, I realise this expression is way too common). Soon after I released v1.0 in april 2007, other static site generators started popping up: StaticMatic and webby had their initial release a few weeks later.<p>Yes, there indeed is a <i>lot</i> of duplication in the static site compilation world. On the “about” page on the nanoc site, I give a list of static site compilers written in Ruby. The list is likely incomplete, even though I try to keep it up-to-date as much as possible. It also only contains site compilers written in Ruby, and omits site compilers written in other languages. The list currently contains the following:<p>* Hobix<p>* Jekyll<p>* Middleman<p>* nanoc<p>* RakeWeb<p>* Rassmalog<p>* Rog<p>* Rote<p>* RubyFrontier<p>* StaticMatic<p>* StaticWeb<p>* Webby<p>* webgen<p>* Yurt CMS<p>* ZenWeb<p>The diversity in static site compilation tools is huge. Static site compilation newbies are likely to be overwhelmed, and this is not a good thing. Can we fix this, please?<p>About a year ago (I don’t recall the exact moment), I informally contacted Tim Pease, author of Webby, and asked whether he would be interested in combining our efforts and merge nanoc and Webby. He unfortunately had no interest in doing so at that time (I’m not sure why).<p>I believe that combining the individual developers’ efforts is the way to go here. Every static site compiler out there has its own strengths and weaknesses. If we want to get rid of those weaknesses and combine those strengths, these projects need to be merged and individual developers need to work together. There are three goals that can be achieved this way:<p>1. Combine the individual tools’ cool features.<p>2. Get rid of weaknesses by seeing how other developers approach the issue.<p>3. Reduce diversity and make it easier for newbies to jump in.<p>I have no plan of action describing how to approach this problem yet. I have little experience as project lead for open-source projects; few of my open-source projects have dedicated contributors. Given that the other static site compilation tools are one-man efforts as well, I suppose that their developers have little more experience than myself (apologies if I’m wrong).<p>So, if you are the developer of a site compilation tool and you’re inspired, do contact me (you can find my e-mail address at stoneship.org/about) and we’ll see how we can tackle this problem. Time for some brainstorming!",1261826924

[are] very important and well done research could have wide ranging positive influence.</i><p>Sure, but there is no shortage of real social science research on the topics Gladwell writes about -- in fact, much of his writing takes the form of summarizing and selecting from the actual research done in the field. This research is rarely presented in a way that is interesting or approachable to the general public -- but you're free to go read a more rigorous discussion if you want to. Apparently most people are content with Gladwell.<p><i>Gladwell proves himself as not a scientist</i><p>Gladwell is absolutely not a scientist, but I don't think he is trying to be one, or would claim to be one.",1261825716

I found them just a year ago.<p>However, I was very young when I started programming, so I probably wouldn't have understood those books - partly for intellectual reasons, and mostly because I'm not a native english speaker.<p>There was another thing that helped me a lot when I was a beginner: I attended a few ""advanced computer courses"" in some kind of ""youth center"", where I had the luck to be taught by really engaged computer freaks. They not only taught me knowledge, they also showed to me how much fun that is - even when digging on assembler level.",1261825658

That isn't even true of major purchases like cars or homes, let alone lifestyle purchases like smartphone apps. <i>Anything</i> can deter that sort of purchase, even the inconvenience of getting up to find the credit card.<p>The step of entering payment instrument information is one of the big pain points. A lot of people have already gone through that wih Amazon and iTunes, not so much for Google Checkout. There could be a plausible case that Google can leapfrog the competition by using ISP billing.",1261825240

7000179,comment,6999481,6999894,9,0,Isamu,,,"I found Mindset to be a good book. Here is my summary:<p>Two mindsets:<p><i>Fixed mindset</i> - talents, abilities and intelligence are fixed, endowed<p><i>Growth mindset</i> - talents, abilities and intelligence are learned and can be developed<p>These mindsets are learned, and have fundamentally different reactions to challenges.<p>The two-mindsets model is a simplification for the purposes of explanation.<p><i>Failure</i><p>The growth mindset embraces failure as a necessary part of learning. In fact failure is a indicator of an area for potential growth, if the opportunity is taken to overcome that failure.\nThe fixed mindset avoids and fears failure; it is taken as evidence of a hard limit of your endowed talent.<p><i>Motivation</i><p>The growth mindset sees effort as necessary to mastery. Almost any level of mastery may be attainable with the right regimen of practice. Obstacles are a normal part of mastery and must be overcome as a matter of course in order to grow. Criticism is not taken personally, but used to indicate areas for improvement and growth.<p>The fixed mindset sees effort as producing only small effects compared to their fixed ability. May be more prone to give up in the face of obstacles since it is thought that there is no new mastery to be gained. Criticism is more likely to be taken personally, as the individual identifies with the perceived limits of their ability and thinks that improvement is impossible beyond a certain point.<p><i>Perceiving others</i><p>The growth mindset is not threatened by others’ abilities. Others’ examples may serve to inspire.\nThe fixed mindset is more likely to be jealous of others’ abilities since they are perceived to be highly desirable gifts and the result of luck and circumstance.<p><i>Teaching Children</i><p>Praise children by emphasizing their work and persistence. \nDo not use labels like “smart” or “gifted” that would reinforce a mindset of fixed abilities.<p><i>Relationships</i><p>Growth oriented mindset is more likely to be understanding and ready to learn from experience.\nFixed mindset sees problems as a result of unchangeable personal attributes and are pessimistic about change. More likely to have unrealistic expectations, like not having to work at a relationship that is “meant to be”.<p><i>Examples</i><p>Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, Babe Ruth and Wilma Rudolph are given as examples of overcoming early setbacks with a growth mindset.<p>Last chapter is a “workshop” of situations and questions to help you develop a growth mindset.",1388678365

That would have steered them to the giant purchasing organizations that control the procurement of up to $300 billion in drugs, devices and supplies annually for some 5,000 health care facilities. These cartels have undermined the laws of supply and demand.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the question is meant to be a question you ask to lead you to where the free market is indeed being broken, not a claim that we have a free market.<p>This is solid logic; if the free market can do anything, it&#x27;s match supply and demand via price signals. (If you&#x27;re having a political reaction to that statement, I mean this in a simple microeconomics sense; it is indeed what free markets <i>do</i>.) In the absence of raw material problems, pervasive shortages are effectively proof that somewhere in the system, someone&#x27;s fixing prices to below production costs.

I certainly don’t remember hearing the word “gamer” in the mid-’90s</i><p>Gamer originated in the 90s, in particular round-about 1996 with Quake, but well before that too with other games. A gamer was someone who packed up their big computer and lugged around a monitor in their car to a LAN party. There were plenty of girls around too, however they were mostly girlfriends and sisters.<p>The strange rape-approving culture and other terms such as &#x27;gg&#x27;, came about because of two factors (I think, anyway). First, most people involved were generally high school or university students, and if you&#x27;ve been to a boys high school party then you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised. Secondly, you generally sat around in a large hallway and the games let you use text chat. It was amusing at the time to talk congenially with your friend next to you and then send him a text message about raping because most of the people didn&#x27;t even know what rape was. You generally saw complete shock if a younger player who was sending messages about rape was actually told what it was. It was probably the novelty of real time text communication. 1337 speak was also very popular around the time for the same reason - it helped to cement who was &#x27;in the know&#x27; in the community.<p>Gaming itself was very much a meritocracy. People at the top of the kill board were the popular ones and people listened to them, and these people would generally travel around to other lan parties and pick up the &#x27;rape culture&#x27; from them, and then it would spread at more lan parties when these knowledgeable players talked about it. Standard social dynamics, I guess.",1388677777

I think Snowden over the last year has been just as sincerely but ultimately mistakenly misguided as Kim Philby[1] was in the 1960s. Snowden appears to think that he has made the world and his native country a better place on a net basis, and he may even be right about what will happen to his native country as a result of his disclosures, but I think he is mistaken about what the overall course of his actions has done for the world as a whole.

I&#x27;m also a home chef, a programmer and a husband. No one of these things identifies me entirely.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of teenage males who play video games and consider &quot;gamer&quot; the entirety of their identity. This is because they haven&#x27;t developed an actual personality yet. These are usually the people who are constantly slinging racial/homophobic epithets and flipping out whenever they encounter a girl online.<p>Their behavior does not affect how I view myself, or the hobbies I engage in.

7000102,comment,6999429,6999839,1,0,thearn4,,,"These are rough guidelines based on current best-practices that I know of, and shouldn&#x27;t be treated as doctrine obviously. Numerical analysis/linear algebra is actually a pretty fast evolving field as far as applied math goes. Though statistics is a bit less dynamic at the moment, I&#x27;d say.<p>Honestly, after a certain amount of time, I&#x27;d expect a new hire would be able to teach me what is state-of-the-art in the field based on new literature.<p>But the questions I&#x27;d have in mind would be couched like this:<p>Linear system:<p><pre><code>    - Is it small, square, and numerically well-conditioned? Use LU - it&#x27;s pretty fast to write and pretty fast to use in practice.\n\n    - Is it small, but rectangular (ie. overdetermined), or not as well conditioned? QR is a good choice.\n\n    - Is it small, but terribly conditioned, or do you want to do rank revealing, or low-rank approximation while you&#x27;re at it? Will you be using this matrix to solve many problems (multiple right-hand sides)? SVD would fit the bill\n\n   - Is it large, or sparse, or implicitly-defined (ie. you don&#x27;t actually have access to the elements of the matrix defining the system - you just have a surrogate function that gives you vectors in its range, or something)? Use an iterative algorithm. Krylov subspace methods (MINRES, GMRES, conjugate gradient, etc) are your friends here.\n</code></pre>\nPattern matching (more specific in question formulation):<p><pre><code>    - If you wanted to determine the &quot;strength&quot; of a waveform (in a finite uniform sampling of data) that is re-occurring in a fairly regular way (like arterial pulse in an array of data taken from an oximeter), what type of transformation would you use, and how would you use the resulting information given in transform domain?\n\n   - What if you wanted to determine the strength of a waveform that is short lived/impulse in nature, but re-occurs without any known periodicities (eg. eye blinks artifacts in a sample of EEG data)\n\n   - How would your answers to the above questions change if there are n separate channels of data collected simultaneously (ie. sampled in different locations), which may be analyzed together?\n</code></pre>\nStatistical analysis (might seem vague, I&#x27;d be more interested in good discussion with a candidate here than in actual whiteboard writing):<p><pre><code>    - What does statistical significance mean, in the context of decision making? Is it a property of the test you perform, or is it a property of your data? (sort of a trick question, this basically rehashes the Fisher vs. Neyman & Pearson debates of the 20th century stats community)\n\n   - Some cod problems of when to use z, t, f tests. Basically, you use them when your situation matches the appropriate inference models (two normally-distributed sample comparison of means with identical variances? t test.)\n\n   - How do you construct an optimal test from scratch, if one doesn&#x27;t already exist for your particular situation? (basically, if minimize type II error with fixed type I makes you comfortable for your problem, can you do use the Neyman-Pearson lemma to do likelihood ratio construction correctly)\n\n   - What does a p-value actually mean? What if you instead wanted to have actual probabilities for your hypotheses, or you had apriori information that you wanted to use? (Bayesian inference is the winner here)\n\n   - Probably something from point estimation: least squares, minimax criterion, Bayesian MAP estimates, general model fitting, those sort of thing. Brings it all back around to numerical (where I&#x27;m most comfortable). Like how applying statistical ridge regression is just knowing how to code up Tikhonov regularization, when you get down to implementation.</code></pre>",1388677671

It started out in 2001 and was, I believe, the first of the DVCS crowd. It had some idiosyncrasies, but was a huge step up from CVS in terms of its principles.<p>tla was forked into baz (previously Bazaar), and bzr (previously Bazaar-NG) was a rewrite taking into account lessons learned from tla/baz. Darcs is yet another DVCS inspired partly by Gnu Arch.<p>So while the explosion of new DVCS around 2005 can definitely be traced back to the Bitkeeper incident, I believe the seed for modern DVCS was laid a bit earlier, in 2001, with Tom Lord&#x27;s Arch. I think Gnu Arch/tla is to be credited with originally introducing many of the concepts of distributed version control.<p>Of course, if anyone knows of earlier history on distributed VCS or a VCS that isn&#x27;t in some way a spiritual successor to TLA I would be quite interesting in knowing that.",1388677147

A child manages to climb up the back side of a slide, and then calls &quot;look, ma!&quot;.

Church<p>I like the overarching theme of what the OP is saying. Good companies provide multiple ways to succeed. Shitty firms provide multiple ways to fail, and only one way to succeed. That&#x27;s why closed allocation is such a pile of 9/11 nukular buttfail: because it&#x27;s founded on the idea that a person is only admitted <i>one</i> avenue for success (but there are numerous ways a person might lose face).<p>Good institutions provide multiple ways for the people within them to succeed. This encourages creativity. Bad companies lay down multiple ways to fail, and only admit one way to succeed. It is known.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is only an artifact of company size. I&#x27;ve seen small companies with that negative, embarrassment-averse culture; I&#x27;ve also seen large companies create pockets of the positive, open-allocation type culture.<p><i>Hardly a day goes by where I don’t find something in my Twitter feed crowing about how a startup that has hit a bump in the road is ”fu&%@d,” or what an “ash%le” a successful founder is, or what an utterly idiotic idea somebody’s company is.</i><p>I am all for product risk and innovation. If someone tries to cure cancer and fails, I&#x27;m going to praise her to the moon for trying. On the other hand, moral failure (asshole founders) I cannot support. There is a huge difference between a scientist who tries for 20 years to cure cancer and falls short (but probably delivers a lot of useful research along the way) and an Evan Spiegel, who fails morally. &quot;We&#x27;re a startup&quot; has been used too many times to justify reckless management and moral bankruptcy. Well I say: fuck that shit.<p>I am all for removing the stigma against good-faith failure. The problem in the VC-funded startup world is all the bad-faith failure that is out there. When someone gets fired with no severance because his 24-year-old, inexperienced, technically incompetent manager turns out to be a wad, no one should congratulate the company for &quot;taking a risk&quot;. Recklessness, the defining trait of the current crop of VC-funded cool kids, is not a virtue.<p><i>It seems like there is a movement to replace today’s startup culture of hope and curiosity with one of smug superiority.</i><p>That &quot;culture of hope and curiosity&quot; is long gone. Snarky people like me are working our asses off in the effort to bring it back. We do it by taking down the Evan Spiegels and Lucas Duplans of the world. We need to take out the trash so there is some fucking space for the good guys.<p><i>Some people would like to turn the technology startup world into one great big company with a degenerative Can’t-Do Culture.</i><p>That&#x27;s VC-istan, not in some future dystopia but right now. With all of the co-funding and note-sharing and collusion, VC has degenerated into a feudal reputation economy that behaves like a large and dysfunctional company where people are too busy padding their resumes and manicuring their reputations to even consider doing anything remotely ballsy.

So it would only be beneficial for new code while all existing code remains the same, with the same encoding bugs if there are any.<p>Every sane program uses the undifferentiated functions, defines UNICODE so that they map to the ★W functions, and uses TCHAR which defining UNICODE causes to map to a wide char. Older programs don&#x27;t define UNICODE and often use char (or CHAR) instead of TCHAR. If they would create a different define (e.g. &#x27;#define UTF8&#x27;) which would map to the new UTF8 functions and would define TCHAR as CHAR then anything doing it either way would do the right thing just by defining UTF8 and recompiling. Only programs that explicitly call the ★W functions (which they never should have exposed) wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;fixed&quot; to use UTF8, but neither would they be broken.<p>> UTF-8 only on Windows is painful<p>...because Microsoft hasn&#x27;t fixed it.<p>> Usually in those cases you use a library/framework/whatever that handles the platform abstraction or just conform to what&#x27;s expected.<p>That&#x27;s a cop out. You&#x27;re just deferring to the frameworks, which also shouldn&#x27;t be using anything other than UTF8, and who may have more difficulty in fixing it because the transition mechanism Microsoft used <i>to</i> unicode is well adaptable to another transition. Not every library you have to use will use the same encoding as the framework and you&#x27;re back to a huge pain. The only way to fix it is for <i>everything</i> to <i>always</i> use UTF8, and deprecate everything else going forward.",1388675805

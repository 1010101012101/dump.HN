The statistics say black women are generally more obese. It's just another suggestion for the difference in responses (which has been established as being wrong <i>for the statistics OKCupid are using</i> - it could still be generally accurate..)<p>> implying that OKCupid is censoring the real reason for the apparent bias against black women on the site: they're just fat.<p>Nah.. I can't see any suggestion that OKCupid was censoring information? I think he means the blog post this links too.<p>Also: there is not implication that ""they're just fat"". Apparently statistically Black women are more obese than White women (I assume those are US stats); it's a reasonable suggestion that the OKCupid community mirrors wider society.<p>>  it claimed that a pairwise comparison between black women and white women could explain black women's poor response rate as compared to all races. That doesn't make any sense.<p>Well we are mostly comparing this to the response rates of white women (at least that's how I am reading all of this) so I see no problem in the conclusion. White women have the highest response rate so it makes logical sense to use them as the comparison point. If we want to consider other races, such as Hispanic, then, yes, we would need the data for them too (who knows; it could match or it could mismatch - therein is the beauty of statistics).",1267893701

What I mean by this is selling sites/hosting/newsletter hosting to small, local businesses.<p>I did this when I was tight on cash, since it can usually be done in a weekend: research a local group of businesses (ie. dentists or furniture stores) using Google Maps and grab all of their info. See which businesses don't have websites - and if they do check out how they look/work.<p>For the companies that didn't, I'd write a simple sales letter offering a discounted website. Something like the client that originally bought the site ended up bailing near the end, but I got a deposit out of them so I'm selling this site for cost. Since the other customer already paid (say, $1000), and costs were $1500, I can give you the site for $500.<p>That site is really just a cheap TemplateMonster design ($40-50) and once I get the payment I'll send over a word doc requesting all of the info they want for the pages and all the media they want uploaded. Probably a good 6-10 hours of work, for a decent profit (I typically charged them around $800 for the site).<p>Once completed you sell them on hosting (grab a VPS for $30/mo. and charge them $50/mo. to host their site - I put ~10 clients on a VPS (comfortably) since the sites get very little traffic). You sell them on newsletter hosting, explain benefits of contacting customers directly about offers for almost $0 cost to them. Email is huge to local businesses, set them up with mail@theirdomain.com and many will worship you. So many people still use xyz123@isp.net for their BUSINESS email.<p>For customers that already have sites, offer a redesign, better functionality (contact/quote request forms, email newsletter hosting, etc.).<p>There's also lots of money in local business directories, if you know anything about SEO. Offer them targeted traffic/leads at $XX/mo. - even more if they want a banner on the site.<p>So much cash offline, go and take it.

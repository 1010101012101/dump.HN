This <i></i>can<i></i> be a binary to compile and create source code, but also and often can be embedded to be used as a library.. im guessing you are using Windows because you&#x27;ve said you dont have a c compiler at hand.. but Windows are most a end-user thing, and end-users probably wont care about compiling code.. otherwise a c/c++ compiler is ubiquotous<p>Im not complaining about the tool, but about the use as a library, which is something this also aim to be, and C is a better aim at that because can be embedded in any language.. given the compiler is in haskel i cant access the AST for instance, i cant embed in my binary, but have to call another external binary instead.. but at least have a runtime to embed.. this may be ok for some.. but i was just saying that, despite the protocol language being very good, i couldnt use it instead of protobuf because i would have a more limited api and my end program/ goal would lose power and flexibility.<p>This is a pretty technical explanation, it could be coded in Brainf*ck.. nothing against the lang in itself.. is just that it limits the use case of this tool(as compared with protobuf)",1420952023

If so, this is overly narrow. There are others ways to get segregation. Quoting from Wikipedia:<p>> Housing segregation traditionally has been the practice of denying African American or other minority groups equal access to housing through the process of misinformation, denial of realty and financing services, and racial steering. Misinformation can take the form of realtors or landlords not giving a certain ethnic group, or race, an accurate portrayal of available units. Racial steering typically occurs when realtors or landlords steer European Americans to available units in white communities, and African Americans to black or racially mixed communities. Generally, racial steering involves misinformation on the part of the realtor or landlord as well, because they will not tell the African Americans or other minorities about the available units in the European American communities.<p>That used information asymmetry, not threats of violence, to steer &#x27;voluntary movement&#x27; and end up with a higher amount of segregation than would have occurred if all parties were equally informed.<p>While illegal, these forms of housing segregation still exist: see <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-obtains-120000-settlement-discrimination-lawsuit-against-chicago-area"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-obtains-120...</a> as an example.

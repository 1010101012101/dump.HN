MS still supports asp classic on the lastest build of iis etc <p>The thing with the MS stack is it improves every single release and gets stronger at a better pace. <p>I am a developer that makes my living using MS tech to build sites and they make my life easier with each update to their platform. <p>You are never tied to a platform in these days, if you decide that you want to change platform then you hire the talent and change.",1197593736

89368,comment,88814,89341,0,0,downer,,,"This has nothing to do with it being statically sized or variably sized.  You have to know what size it is when you are going to reverse it.  The solution presented works as long as the programmer knows what the size is.<p>If you want to posit any kind of <i>sane</i> question, then you can have a sane solution.",1197592733

Anyone know if it's possible to automate the process of putting the little white pixel dust around the images for transparent GIFs that work with colored backgrounds?",1197591569
89363,comment,89302,89302,0,0,zaidf,,,"Before you worry about the when and how, you should take a step back and be clear on your launch time goal.<p>With your initial launch, you don't necessarily want a big PR hit that draws 1000s of users to checkout your site. What you do want is a small group that joins your site and gives you feedback. Go for the big PR hit when you are more sure from your small user-base that you have a great product. <p>That was our plan. Fortunately(or unfortunately) we posted on the techcrunch forums and some people loved it and passed it to digg and soon it made the TC homepage without even submitting to them--making to TC was our 3 month goal.",1197591556

89359,comment,89259,89345,0,0,drm237,,,"I think that MySpace proves that going the MS route can be viable.  PlentyOfFish.com seems to be doing pretty well also.  I agree with 'idea' that the price isn't the issue, the complicated licensing structure is the administrative nightmare.<p>I used to do all MS at the company I did IT for, but now that I'm on my own I concentrate on LAMP.  Both have advantages and disadvantages.",1197590785

89356,comment,89259,89349,0,0,drm237,,,"True, but I don't think you can use the action pack software in a production environment.  It's more like MSDN software; for internal use in development/testing scenarios.  Even still, it's a great deal and is highly recommended if you run any MS software in your shop.",1197590454

And when I had more free time (just a couple of years ago), I did them more often.<p>There is just very little doubt in my mind that the choice afforded by a nice passive income would help me do more things that make me happy.<p>Also, I hate Doritos. :-)<p>Know thyself, I guess.",1197590411

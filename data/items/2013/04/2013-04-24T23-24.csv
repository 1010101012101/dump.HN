5604833,comment,5604598,5604762,13,0,geebee,,,"There can be a problem, though, with very uneven types of protectionism.  For instance, suppose both apples and oranges are both subjected to very high tariffs.  Then, you remove all tariffs from oranges, but leave them high on apples. you should expect domestic production to shift to apples and foreign production to shift to oranges, to the extent possible.<p>I can see how you would feel that creating more work visas would lead to a freer market.  However, if these visas are heavily concentrated in STEM fields, this may end up producing a very distorted market that deters US citizens from pursuing degrees in this field.<p>One of the provisions of the immigration bill is to grant green cards to graduates of US-based STEM programs at the MS or PhD leve.  Rather than a more general liberalization of immigration, that's just the sort of highly specific, targeted program that can produce severe market distortions.<p>Many of the people who object to these visas actually support more general liberalization of immigration - they just object to visa programs that are based on the notion that we need to use immigration specifically to increase the size of the STEM workforce.  This is because they believe, as this article suggests, there is no shortage of STEM workers.",1366847932

5604818,comment,5600538,5600538,4,0,graycat,,,"I've never lived in a wealthy neighborhood but
have always lived in at least nice neighborhoods.
In each of those neighborhoods, if look around,
see that the most common job that supports the
families is being the head, often a sole proprietor,
of a small or medium business.  For the point of
the article, these small business heads have a
big advantage:  Their age doesn't matter as long
as they can keep doing the work or at least keep
doing well managing the work.<p>Yes, there are reports of major companies who
hire Bachelor's and Master's degree engineers
and by age 35 want them into management or out
the door.  So, maybe 1 in 100 stays around
for a full career.  So, at age 18 there
is Joe and Sam.  Joe goes to college
and graduate school in engineering, joins
the big company, and is out the door at
age 35.  Sam did some yard work in high
school and just continues.  Soon he has
six trucks and 12 guys working for him.
He has a house and a family, and his wife
helps with scheduling, billing, and
customer service.  As long as the grass
keeps growing, he's okay.  He's expanding
into lawn service for higher end clients,
e.g., banks, medical office campuses, etc.  
He's planning to expand into landscape architecture 
with a plant nursery.  So at age 35, Joe
is out of work and Sam is doing much better.<p>Sam has a neighbor Pete who is an electrician.
He doesn't bother to put his name in the 
Yellow Pages; he doesn't have a Web site;
actually he does nothing on publicity.  But
he still gets plenty of calls, has a house,
family, truck, and an apprentice.  Roger
got a Ph.D. in electronic engineering,
worked for the big company, got fired at
age 35, and wishes he could swap his 
Ph.D. for an electrician's license.<p>Kelly's father ran a small grocery
store with two gas pumps out front.
Now Kelly runs 10 gas stations with
convenience stores, has a 50' yacht,
a summer place on the water, a winter
place in the mountains, and is paying
full tuition for his children at private
high schools and colleges.  At his yacht
club he notices a lot of small business
guys like himself but nearly no technical
employees or venture funded entrepreneurs.<p>More generally, a career should last 40+
years.  Okay, look around:  What big 
companies have ever provided such long
lasting careers?  How commonly?  E.g.,
IBM?  Okay, near 1994 they lost $16 
billion and went from 407,000 employees
down to 205,000.  A LOT of careers got
ended way before 40 years.  So, at IBM,
if joined in 1954 then had a chance of
getting in 40 years.  Much before 1954,
IBM didn't look so good. So, really,
for revered IBM, really had to join
in the early 1950s -- that was about
the only chance.  Much the same
for GM, GE, AT&T, etc.<p>Lesson 1:  For a 40+ year career with one
big company, mostly just f'get about it.
Maybe can pull that off in K-12 teaching,
college teaching if can get tenure, 
or working for state or the federal
government.<p>Lesson 2:  A huge fraction of the people
with stable careers for 40+ years head
their own small businesses.<p>Okay, for hackers and HN, we have:<p>Lesson 3:  By age 35 or so, likely gotta
be running your own business.  Just
grind that into your planning.  For
'information technology', maybe it 
can be a great advantage.  Still have
to be running your own business.<p>Competition, how to handle competition?
How do the people in the houses on the
nice streets do it?  Sure, they nearly all
take great advantage of a geographical
barrier to entry.  Since nearly no one
drives over 50 miles to see a dentist,
be one of the best dentists in a radius
of 50 miles and do well.  Same for being
an electrician, running a lawn service,
remodeling kitchens and baths, auto
repair, auto body repair, independent
insurance agent, manufacturer's representative,
etc.<p>So, hackers should plan to do an 'information
technology' startup.  If it does as well as
a successful electrician, okay.  As well
as a guy with 10 gas stations and convenience
stores, still better.  As well as Google,
terrific.  Still, can't much hope to do
well just working for a salary.<p>Alternatives?  Sure, there can be many.
Maybe will get founder's stock in a
successful startup.<p>Still, look up and down the nice 
residential streets and see a lot of
guys running their own businesses.
So, do much the same except use
information technology as an advantage.<p>For the article, it goes on and on about
the 'reasons' a guy 50 can't get a job
programming -- he asks for too much money,
his skills are out of date, etc.  The
""too much money"" is no reason to be
unemployable; the fact is, he won't
be hired at anything much above 
minimum wage.  Skills?  His 'skills'
may be far superior, and for being
'up to date' with the latest version of
some language, that's as easy or easier
for an experienced guy than a young
guy.<p>But
there is another reason:  The supervisor
is supposed to be older, and the subordinate,
younger.  So, a guy 50 has to work for
a guy 60 and can't work for a guy 40.<p>There's just no way out of it:  In the
US, big corporations as sources of 
careers are going away -- have heavily
gone away.  Maybe if the US would get
back on its feet, e.g., quit being so
happy about creating economic
booms in distant countries, big
companies could be stable enough to
provide good, long term employment.
Maybe.  So, right, notice that one
of the keys is to have a good geographical
barrier to entry, that is, no competition
from distant countries.  So, basically
the US is losing out on competing 
around the world so that what's left
are lots of small businesses each of which
serves customers in a radius of about 
50 miles.  Sad situation.<p>There is another observation:  Supposedly
the 1-2 wealthiest areas in the US
are Silicon Valley and Greenwich, CT
(with the hedge funds).  Well, third
is within about 60 miles of the Washington
Monument.  Because the Federal Civil
Service pays so well?  Yes, but only
indirectly.  The guys with the really
nice houses in the best neighborhoods
in that area mostly are not working
for the Federal Government.  Instead
they are running small businesses
where the customers are the Federal
Government or are working for the
Federal Government.  E.g., a dentist
can do well because the millions of
people there working for the Federal
Government aren't rich but are relatively
well off and can afford to pay for a
dentist.  So, if want to run your own
small business, then maybe pick one
of those three areas.  E.g., in Silicon
Valley, to heck with venture capital
and information technology and, instead,
be an electrician who installs fantastic
underwater lighting in swimming pools
of successful information technology
entrepreneurs.  Or run a red sauce
Italian restaurant, say, near 
Gaithersburg, MD.",1366847644
5604817,comment,5603644,5603644,0,0,wsc981,,,"I think this policy makes perfect sense. In the Netherlands we've put the borders wide open since the early 90s and perhaps even earlier due to EU legislation. Overall the results have been terrible. These are some of the issues we deal with nowadays:<p>- many immigrants are on welfare, this puts a huge economic pressure on our country.<p>- many immigrants of Middle-Eastern descent put a huge pressure on our healthcare (e.g. very many visits to our general practitioners).<p>- the culture of many Middle-Eastern immigrants doesn't merge very well with our Western culture. E.g. in Marrocan culture boys are generally higher regarded as girls. Additionally these boys are one of our biggest problem groups (very high criminality). Mothers don't have the means to correct these boys.<p>- I should note Marrocan girls seem to do pretty well in the Netherlands, low criminality and generally hard working students at school with good grades.<p>It's interesting when browsing fora of Dutch-Marrocan people (for example http.maroc.nl) you often see posts of Marrocan girls looking for converted (to Islam) Dutch guys to wed. These girls often prefer converted Dutch partner because the girls themselves would have more freedom in such a relation.<p>Many of these immigrants live close to each other. Since many woman don't work and are not allowed to leave home by themselves except for shopping / visiting the doctor, they often don't learn the Dutch language which results in them being socially excluded from the Dutch society.<p>In my opinion our own government failed big time on this. We should have had limited immigration from the start (early 70s or 80s perhaps?) and when people would come we should have made sure immigrants would be spread around cities, not living close to each other in ""ghettos"". This would have forced many immigrants to integrate better in our society.<p>Either way, I think unlimited immigration puts huge strains on society and eventually destabilises society as a whole because of culture clashes.",1366847628

Such statements are insulting and fit with the tone of the article, which essentially attacks Mr. Sherman as incompetent and a virtual imbecile. The author appears to have some other motive to be so bluntly disrespectful to someone who has passed. C.Y.A.? Personality conflicts? Something else? Who knows? But, since Mr. Sherman is not here to defend his actions or rationale, it seems a shame to allow these ridiculous memes about him to thrive.<p>I'm sure there is valid criticism that one can heap on Mr. Sherman's days at the helm of Ecomom and the decisions he made (including the one to discount products and give up his margin).

This isn't a stealth marketing campaign by a Hollywood distribution company, using Zach Braff as the front man. This is Zach the person. He may be a celebrity, and he may have tens of millions in the bank -- but if there's an interesting way to validate demand for his movie, market the movie, <i>and</i> partially finance it, why shouldn't he try? It's smart business.<p>Now, I understand the argument that the Zach Braffs and Rob Thomases of the world pose a danger to the future of truly independent artists and filmmakers. As I see it, there are two potential dangers here: 1) that they raise the creative and marketing bars beyond the level of the average Kickstarter artisan's ability to compete; 2) that they attract big companies, who will start subverting the Kickstarter spirit by using it to market, pre-sell, and finance Hollywood productions.<p>Of these two dangers, #1 hasn't seemed to materialize just yet (though the jury's still out). If anything, the presence of big names on Kickstarter seems to be shining more of a spotlight on the site -- and the rising tide may lift all boats. Danger #2, however, remains distant but possible. One can only hope that the market is smart enough to reward the deserving and punish/withhold from the undeserving. But we'll see.<p>In the meantime, I see no reason to limit Kickstarter to projects and people ""who can't get funding elsewhere."" Kickstarter should be a free marketplace for ideas. The quality of the ideas should drive the level of funding the ideas receive. If established filmmakers and stars want to trade off of their brands to get a leg up, so be it -- it seems to provide real value to their fans. Remember that there are real people in the ""crowd"" behind crowdfunding. If thousands of real people want to pay real money to see X product brought to life, why should we stop them?<p>If anything, Kickstarter may provide a real alternative to Hollywood financing for creatives who don't want to play the Hollywood game if they can help it.

If they pay the bills from the fund directly they're out 2.1M without a sales tax return, if they pay 2.1 to the company and the company pays the bills the company gets back the sales tax so effectively this saves 20K or in this example about 1%. Not much but also not nothing, and if a fund does a lot of smaller deals this sort of thing adds up.<p>Not all funds suffer from this (likely Spark isn't one of them) so the ability of other funds to match this is dependent on whether or not they have classed themselves in such a way that they are sales tax exempt.<p>I'd imagine Spark to be able to offer exactly the legal fees less for the same amount of stock in company 'x' compared to some competitor that does it the usual way so effectively this shouldn't matter but it is excellent publicity for Spark.",1366846310

I go to a top-tier engineering university, and I know of multiple individuals who had perfect SAT scores and GPAs in high school that have been utter disappointments, and I've known people who by no reasonable metric should have gotten in that break curves in nearly every class. Hell, I was the first of 3 boys to get accepted here through normal means, but both of my older brothers ended up transferring in and subsequently graduated with GPAs of 3.96 and 4.0, with one now working on a PhD in physics under a Nobel Laureate and the other working in investment banking. I've honestly started to question how much predictive power these tradition metrics actually have among the subsets of students who think they have a good enough chance of getting in to a school to apply in the first place.

This has all the markings of a sophisticated campaign.<p>Sophisticated?  That&#x27;s pretty laughable.  To most outside observers this looks like  monkeys flinging poo.<p>In addition, you make a serious error in your assumptions:<p>Popular != technically correct\nUnpopular != technically incorrect<p>RedHat did not just magically have an epiphany and decide to shove systemd down on everybody.  They started by using &quot;upstart&quot;.  Remember how everybody went apeshit over that?  Sounds a whole lot like the current debate doesn&#x27;t it?  After using upstart for a while, folks at RedHat decided that wasn&#x27;t sufficient and they needed a replacement for <i>that</i>.<p>People seem to think that just magically RedHat decided to rip things up for no reason at all.  That&#x27;s patently false--RedHat has some issues that need to be solved and systemd solves those.  If you want to beat systemd, you&#x27;re going to have to give RedHat <i>something which works better</i>.<p>After their experience with upstart, it&#x27;s no surprise that RedHat just decided to ignore the community.  It was clear that a solution was never going to be accepted.",1446357569

Take Uber, people like it and it works well. It is hard for the law to stop this and public opinion is quite loudly for it, so it stands. The internet is changing from centralized to distributed with finance depending on it wholly for infrastructure.<p>Protocols will change at that level and slowly money will become more digitized. Even without bitcoin, it will be possible to quickly transfer funds from organizations at banks. If the public embraces this, the gov&#x27;t can&#x27;t do anything.<p>This is like a riot for freedom. When enough people do something the government is outnumbered and it becomes defacto legal. Often, this rare phenomenon is referred as <i>democracy</i>.<p>Drones falling on people will be bad. Some people will be scammers. Medical devices/technoques will be more dangerous (with better upside). People will hide income which is good for the individualshort-term but bad for the governemnt, and possibly everyone long term. Wages are fucked.<p>This will force cooperation between people and ultimately governments because the power distance delta will be lowered significantly from a person to &quot;the government&quot;. Technology is killing government just like home taping killed the music industry. Very slowly.",1446357549

10485566,comment,10485012,10485428,0,0,adventured,,,"The US is in fact the pinnacle of education, in several regards. For example it has by far the best university system. No other country comes even remotely close. On any list of the top 50 universities on earth, the US will routinely take the top 40 or 45 slots. If you make a list of the top 20 universities, it&#x27;s going to be dominated by 19 from the US, with Oxford thrown in for good measure.<p>The US won the math olympiad this year, and is pretty much always near the top. You might want to check out where certain highly praised European countries tend to come in every year by comparison.<p>The US has one of the highest GDP per capita levels, at $56,000 (#5 for 2015, behind only a few tiny nations), to go with one of the highest median incomes - you don&#x27;t accomplish that without some amazing education output. The US leads in nobel prizes globally. The US leads in general innovation, R&D, and sheer scientific output. Its universities are productive in that regard in ways nobody else comes close to. Its economy is also one of the most productive.<p>The US leads in space, space tech, aerospace, medtech, biotech, pharma, software, Web, Internet, mobile, agriculture, entertainment, defense tech, is one of the leaders in computing hardware, and is also one of the leaders in pretty much every type of energy technology. It&#x27;s also the world&#x27;s #2 manufacturer.<p>So yeah, the US does a lot of things really really well. You don&#x27;t accomplish all of that, and manage to produce such a massive economic engine for over a century, with extremely high output levels per capita, without at least a decent education system to go with it - which is why so few countries can match up to the US economically or scientifically.",1446356753
10485565,comment,10485012,10485397,0,0,east2west,,,"You appear to have a view shaped by the Nationalist propaganda. The Flying Tigers were mercenaries recruited from US Naval aviation and Marine corps because the top commanders were more sympathetic to Chinese plight. They were in China before Pearl Harbor, hence so-called &quot;volunteers.&quot; Russian pilots, also called &quot;volunteers,&quot; helped defend Wuhan before Americans got there. The demise of Chinese Air Force was a direct result of incompetence on Madam Soon, who for political reason had a hand in procurement and wanted to save money until the war started. The Chinese pilots were exclusively recruited from the upper class and generally lacked skills and capabilities to mount effective campaigns or devise innovative tactics. The Kumingdon so mismanaged the war efforts that in 1945 Japanese force could still launch successful drive across China to improve their line of communication, and when American air power failed to stop Japanese advances, the American Commanding general, general Chennault wanted to fly in ammunitions to Chinese ground troops, like general Stilwell earlier advocated, generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (that is right, the husband of the first lady wasn&#x27;t the president of China; in fact he lacked legality, but had legitimacy, for his rule during the entire war) refused because he couldn&#x27;t be certain his troops wouldn&#x27;t turn their guns on him and replace him with a competent leader. The performance of Chinese force during WWII was abysmal, which directly contributed to loss of the Outer Mongolia as the price for Soviets to open a second front against the Japanese. It is not just that Chinese troops were ill trained, ill equipped, and poorly led; they were ill clothed, ill fed, had no ammunition; the Chinese soldiers were worth more to his commander dead then alive because the commander could forge headcounts and pocket dead soldiers&#x27; pay. The entire government and the armed force were thoroughly corrupted.<p>I just cannot let you cast aspersion on general Stilwell without challenge. He did clash repeatedly with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek because he wanted to fight the Japanese and the generalissimo did not. He wanted to equip and train Chinese Army, but the generalissimo only wanted to maintain his control over elite Chinese units because that is how he controlled China. An American once asked the commander of the best artillery unit, after patiently inspecting German made 150mm guns, why he didn&#x27;t move his unit to the front line and actually fight, he was astounded when the commander replied that he didn&#x27;t want to suffer loss and no longer being the best artillery unit in Chinese Army. The Chinese Expeditionary force to Burma was remote-controlled by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, who insisted that the entire force go through dangerous mountain range to retreat back into China rather than going to India. The units that obeyed and went back to Chine suffered such loss that they had to be reconstituted, while one brave commander took his troops to India saw his division forming the core of counter offensives later. The same commander, who was trained in US, would later train the main force defending Taiwan. Most of loss suffered by the Chinese Expeditionary force was non-combat causalities.<p>Madam Soon May-in, as you call her, was greedy, corrupt, clever in PR, and did more than her part in losing China to the Communists. Her meddling in politics made it impossible for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s son to do even minor reforms to cleanse the government. Corruption was so bad that when a top commander correctly outed a Communist spy because the spy was above reproach, the spy correctly fingered another spy (they worked for different branches of Communists) in the Defense department because he was also clean, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek chastised his top commander for effectively saying no Nationalists could be clean. I couldn&#x27;t make this up.<p>I suggest you carefully read all sides before making your mind. I hate the Communist with all my heart but the Nationalist lost the mainland because they were corrupt, incompetent, and organized themselves on a classical Chinese patronage system, which ironically the Communists are doing their best to emulate. The corrupt but all powerful bureaucracy has reasserted itself, as it has done for two thousand years. The choice is suicide now, by attempting reform, or suicide later, by doing nothing. All the wounds are self-inflicted. The Chinese Communists are wisely choosing to wait, as the Empress Dowager did during the last era of Qin dynasty. It is truly a tragedy. The Chinese revolution, it turned out, wasn&#x27;t necessary.",1446356680

10485553,comment,10485032,10485444,0,0,escape_goat,,,"> ...research like that in which contemporary behavioural geneticists engage helped to undermine the eugenics movement by proving that eugenic policies could not achieve their stated goals.<p>What&#x27;s being discussed here is the historical eugenics movement.  Just from the text of the article, it becomes clear that the multi-generational confounding effects like prosperity, education, and social class would make an naive effort pointless.<p>More generally, you should think of the problem thusly, I suggest:<p>Even with extensive genetic surveys, there are no clear candidates for genes that one would wish to select for that present themselves;  this is consistent with the notion that general cognitive ability is evolutionarily advantageous.<p>It may be that g.c.a. is locally maximal;  that there is no easy conflux of changes which could occur that would predictably raise the g.c.a of human individuals.  A hypothetical change might for instance do something that would seem likely to increase cognitive ability, in the abstract, but carry a systemic cost that either prevents such a change from manifesting itself, or renders the value of such a change moot.<p>For most people, I believe, it seems intuitively clear that eugenics is analogous.<p>We know that eugenics efforts cannot produce any remarkable or decisive selection for increased cognitive abilities.  We know this because eugenics is a sort of hobby-horse form of evolution, across handfuls of generations, and because evolution cannot, taken over thousands of generations, select any more strongly for increased cognitive abilities than it already has.  If it could, it would;  thus we must conclude that it can&#x27;t.<p>We also know that eugenics requires a society that permits centralized, forcible control over how and whether individuals combine genetic material to produce offspring;  it requires a society wherein all individuals can be indoctrinated so as to cooperate with this effort;  it requires a society wherein these means of force and social control cannot be usurped or arrogated by elements of that society so that they may be directed towards other purposes;  and it requires that this state of affairs persist for a modest number of generations, perhaps twenty to fifty.<p>It seems very likely that selection for eugenics is something which will fail because of the systemic costs that it would entail.  In fact, it seems more likely than not that eugenics is something that would have arisen in the course of history, already --- perhaps for more trivial purposes than increasing cognitive ability --- were the social structures required not too fragile to sustain the effort.",1446356327

Market players compete to bring products / services to the market that both a) people want to choose, and b) is cheap to provide. Because it is not the case that the most desirable service is the most expensive to provide, that allows for competition. Markets &quot;learn&quot; over time, advantages gained by one firm are copied by others requiring constant innovation.<p>The job market is no different, but the second quality, being cheap to provide, means there is going to be a constant degrading in the monetary compensation offered to workers, while the <i>desired benefits</i> those workers are getting is paradoxically going to increase. You can most clearly see this in companies like Uber where compensation gets slashed every year, but there&#x27;s no truly mass uprising of drivers taking place.<p>You can treat this as a failure of union outreach, that Uber drivers should unionize and demand relief. But it&#x27;s not like they <i>can&#x27;t</i> organize. They were perfectly capable of organizing a march at Uber headquarters. No, most Uber drivers <i>choose</i> to keep driving, the arguments that they&#x27;re being exploited seem a little thin when you realize that Uber drivers could be doing just about anything else to make more money if they were really truly being exploited. Workers in America have unparalleled ability, compared to other countries, to try out other industries and occupations.<p>What I think is happening, is that the information age has brought unmatched and unmeasurable utility to common people, in the form of free services provided by tech companies, to <i>everyone</i> (take a second to let it sink in just how unprecedented this is, historically, for a hugely valuable service, like Google search, to be provided to anybody with a Internet connection) and the job market is simply adjusting to meet the new status quo.<p>Being poor in America isn&#x27;t nearly as horrible as it used to be. You don&#x27;t need to expend unreal amounts of effort to increase your station just to have a more-or-less happy life anymore. Homeless people all can get online <i>somehow</i>. And that access provides them with incalculable value. There&#x27;s a reason that everywhere you go, you see people buried in their smartphones. They&#x27;re choosing smartphone interaction over <i>everything else they could be doing right now</i>.<p>So the labor market is adjusting to fit.

What direction do you want to go in with your career?<p>I think you really need to think through where you&#x27;d like to be when you get out of school. Do you want to work at a big company or a startup? Is there a problem space that you have a passion for (this can be anything from finding a cure to cancer to videogames)? Are you into a certain language or a certain platform?<p>The people who stand out are the people who have a passion for something. If your obsession is stock picking then you want to bring that passion to an investment bank. If your obsession is self driving cars then you want to work for a tesla or uber.<p>There&#x27;s the old Woody Allen phrase &quot;half of life is showing up&quot;. In a humorous way you can envision a slacker who shows up for school and manages to pass, but in reality it&#x27;s showing up and hooking up with the people or projects that you want to work on.<p>By the way I trick I use is this: If I gave you several million dollars and no conditions, what would you do with it? Would you buy a house or start a startup? By the way don&#x27;t buy the hype and be honest with yourself on that answer. Many people are selling startups, but there&#x27;s a world of people doing other things out there.",1446354713

And it is well known that Churchill himself said that winning the battle of the Atlantic was critical to Great Britain&#x27;s survival.<p>In a later phase in early 1942, after America had entered the war but before it understood the threat, German subs sunk 609 ships at a loss of only 22 u-boats.

It was designed for an idealised situation (e.g. shooting range). Not as the article describes it &quot;total war&quot; where you have to carry everything you need to the battlefield. That meant issues like weight, complexity (for field repair), and replacements became a real headache. Arguably the real issue could have been bad feedback/communications between lower ranks and engineers/designers (and something we still see today with field equipment failing e.g. see the M16&#x27;s long history, and how long it took for some of the changes).<p>The F-35 is more &quot;too many chefs in the kitchen.&quot; The F-35 likely is over-engineered, but not because of too little feedback like the MG 42, but too much. Every major US military arm tacked on their own little requirements here and there, until the aircraft was so loaded down with toys and gadgets that it could barely fly.

My original point was private companies do most of the drug discovery now with gov&#x27;t funds helping out.  The marketing expense doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>As for the marketing expense, selling drugs is a high touch business.  You can&#x27;t just run ads, you need sales people to go and visit doctors, answer their questions, provide educational materials.  That costs a lot of money.  The $24B in marketing to physicians is likely mostly the salary of sales reps.<p>And before you say that it&#x27;s not needed, I&#x27;ve spoken to a number of doctors that have a good relationship with sales reps and find them helpful.  They don&#x27;t have time to keep up on every new piece of data on a drug.<p>If you&#x27;re drug is crap, you won&#x27;t be able to sell it, period.  A great example is Pfizer&#x27;s inhaled insulin, Exubera.  It barely sold $20M at peak.  You&#x27;d think a company like Pfizer who are marketing geniuses could move anything, but they couldn&#x27;t move Exubera because it was a crap drug.",1446354104

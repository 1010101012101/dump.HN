7022818,comment,7018811,7022389,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"Yes, it is power, tons of it, in a wide variety of forms.<p>That someone doesn&#x27;t care has little effect on how others can use the information - the only power that that removes is the power to embarrass. Any party that you depend on economically can still use the information to their advantage (and your disadvantage). And mind you that that might not only be for irrational reasons - any statistically significant correlation is a perfectly rational reason for some company to refuse you as a customer or to increase prices for you, for example. In securities markets, there even is a name for using private information about planned transactions to gain an advantage, it&#x27;s called front running, and it&#x27;s illegal, because it is considered to be essentially stealing the customer&#x27;s money.<p>But also, much of the power is not power over individuals, but power over society as a whole, in that such direct access to inter-human communication allows you to find patterns in social dynamics and thus allows you to predict future actions, and what it would need to change the outcome. In essence, that is what marketing is all about - but of course, its applicability is not limited to selling you washing powder, but it can also be used to &quot;sell&quot; political ideas. And in the case of Facebook, they can directly manipulate what people get to see, of course.<p>And then, there is the intersection between the two, in that there are some people who themselves have more power than others, possibly over you - and if someone gains some power over them directly, that means they might transitively also be gaining power over you.",1389178708
7022816,comment,7022271,7022702,5,0,gtirloni,,,"If you think only about creating content, I think you have a very good argument. Historically, not everybody was fit/interested in creating.<p>However, the underlying theme in these books seems to be one of freedom and our destiny. I don&#x27;t think they focus much on creation but more on assessing reality and being able to change it.<p>In the past, at least in my 3rd world country, people were much more interesting in politics, health, education, etc. Nowadays, most people are happy to be distracted so I fully agree with the author here. Over and over, political scandals abound, corruption is everywhere and made plain clear to anyone who wants to see it.. yet, I don&#x27;t see anyone complaining as they did in the past. It seems we&#x27;ve reached a plateau and we&#x27;re comfortable enough. Distracted enough perhaps.<p>Perhaps the potential to create has kept the same, not very high, lots of wasted potential. But the potential to be angry/worried about things that matter seems to be going down the toilet lately. Just see how nobody besides IT people and the media cares about the NSA scandal.",1389178651

7022814,comment,7021057,7022052,1,0,vacri,,,"-- <i>OK, to begin with, Australia still bans things. This is something the USA grew out of decades ago:</i><p>BULL and SHIT. In Australia, there is no routine pixellation of middle fingers, likewise pixellating the <i>mouth</i> of someone swearing.<p>It&#x27;s an utter fabrication that there&#x27;s no censorship on things in the US: <i>It is a violation of federal law to air obscene programming at any time. It is also a violation of federal law to air indecent programming or profane language during certain hours.</i>&quot;, from <a href""http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanit"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity</a><p>And I&#x27;ve already mentioned the Press Freedom Index, which indicates the Australian press is freer (scum that they are) than the US press. There&#x27;s a difference between idealism and how the place is actually run. Hell, the US even introduced the anglosphere to the concept of &quot;Free Speech Zones&quot;.<p>Hell, even <i>movie ratings</i> are a form of censorship, and the US has those. Those movie ratings cause movies to be modified in order to meet them. The US even introduced the world to &quot;Parental advisory: explicit lyrics&quot; which was a soft form of censorship; some stores would not carry such marked CDs, and some shopping centres would not allow stores within to carry them.<p>Some US states prevent atheists from holding political office - that&#x27;s an explicit penalty for exercising freedom of speech.<p>When I was in San Francisco, it was <i>illegal</i> for me to take a photo of a school. Standing in a public place, it was illegal for me to take a normal point&#x27;n&#x27;click photo facing one direction but not another. Similarly, both countries ban public nudity except in some specific areas.<p>Then, of course, there&#x27;s all the provisions for the support of US IP law and legislating against filesharing that Australia has had to engage in duty to treaty obligations with the US.<p>Ultimately, when you say &quot;Australia still bans things&quot;, you make it sound like a commonplace experience. It really isn&#x27;t - and banned items are few and far between. Your wikipedia link has little that Australia has banned in the past couple of decades, and includes paragraphs like: <i>Explicit sex scenes have also become more common. Channel Nine&#x27;s crime drama Underbelly has frequent coarse language and sex (including explicit anal rape) with one episode featuring a &quot;drug-fuelled orgy with prostitutes accompanied by the Spiderbait song &quot;Fucken Awesome&quot;&quot;.</i> I am actually interested to hear if you can name more than a handful of banned items from the past couple of decades. By the way, does exporting cryptography count?<p>The US does have better protections for individual freedom of speech, but the gulf between the two nations really isn&#x27;t all that large, nor is it all in the US&#x27;s favour.<p>-- <i>Which are similar to the insane laws against denying the Holocaust or even using certain images in parts of Europe:</i><p>One thing that we here in the Anglosphere need to remember is that in WW2, we were unequivocably on the side of moral good. We were fighting the clearest moral evil humanity has known. All of the Anglosphere, undivided. For the European continent, the experience was much more complex and painful, and even those countries that fought against the Axis had plenty of collaborators. Idealism is nice... until it&#x27;s tested, then pragmatism needs to have a voice.<p>In any case, you&#x27;re talking about a very specific incident in history, which in Europe has a very real knock-on effect of lending support to neo-nazism. You can go hog-wild about denying the efficacy of Bismarck&#x27;s reforms. Question Kaiser Wilhelm all you want. But the pragmatism of legislating against holocaust denial or sporting the swastika is basically the same as anti-defamation legislation: it&#x27;s saying &#x27;don&#x27;t diminish this&#x27;.<p>Think about it this way: those laws are <i>very</i> specific in terms of what they ban. So you can&#x27;t show the swastika in Germany. It doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re going to &#x27;slippery-slope&#x27; their way to banning other images. There seems to be a belief in America that Germans want to obscure the past - they don&#x27;t. From a friend in Germany, they&#x27;re acutely ashamed of that past, and these laws help to avoid obscuring that past and lessening the impact of the resulting lessons. The laws you speak of here aren&#x27;t things that hit people in their everyday lives, they&#x27;re specific, targeted laws. The laws would not be around in an ideal world, but in a practical world, there is a tangible reason for them. As laws go, they&#x27;re not &#x27;insane&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how the side-effects you see of these laws is any better or worse than the routine emotional pain that folks like the Westboro Baptist Church deal out under freedom of speech laws. Not showing a swastika in a manner other than historical education, compared against having a lunatic scream at me while I&#x27;m burying a loved one? Which one actually has the more social or psychological harm there?<p>-- <i>What&#x27;s worse, they do nothing to solve any of the real problems modern Europe has with anti-Roma and anti-Muslim racism.</i><p>US free speech also does nothing to solve any of the real problems modern America has with anti-Mexican and anti-Muslim racism. The holocaust denial laws are not there to solve racism. They&#x27;re there to stem violent nationalism, the European forms of which don&#x27;t exist in the US.",1389178644

7022812,comment,7019914,7020816,3,0,dspillett,,,"IIRC there was not any animosity between the firefox an dDebian teams though (there was plenty <i>reported</i> by people who saw the matter and misreported it, and Stallman waded in as is his style which didn&#x27;t help the mis reporting (&quot;RMS ponders whether Firefox is truly free&quot; was reported as &quot;entire open source community vs Firefox, fight at 11&quot; by some)).<p>They started user the trademark thing to force some distributors who were adding patches they did not want to be associated with (either because they were just plain malicious or because they didn&#x27;t want thie bug tracker filled with reports about code they had nothing to do with), the Debian people scanned the relevant legal details and decided that they either needed to stop using hte name or work put together an agreement that covered them. The latter would have been easy enough but was against their preferred WayOfThings(tm) as it would mean downstream of them would (legally speaking) need to make changes or separately arrange an agreement, so they chose a new branding instead.<p>Neither the Firefox team protecting their name or the Debian team stucking to their mission statement is wrong IMO (though of course some may desagree, depending on definitions of &quot;free&quot; and so forth, so they could be said to be wrong), but without the branding change the two are incompatible on a legal point that was only enforce to stop the malicious.<p>With the branding change the &quot;conflict&quot; is resolved, and no one is really unhappy or otherwise reasonably put out.<p>The RedHat/CentOS case is a bit different: the way CentOS were using the name in no way implied that RedHat was responsible for CentOS but did accurately represent how CentOS was built, so CentOS were probably on good legal ground but capitulated because they didn&#x27;t want that particular fight. This, IMO, made RadHat somewhat bully-like in this case - though to be honest it takes more than one iffy commercial/legal wrangle to undo the pile of good that Redhat has (directly and otherwise) done for Linux and related projects over the years (and continues to do).",1389178576

The higher res screen is noticeably nicer to read.  Sure, you don&#x27;t need to go to the crazy extremes of some newer high res phones, but standard desktop monitors are noticeably ugly by comparison.<p>- Secondly, the res is high enough that you can finally change (apparent) resolution.  My parents are in their late 60s and have bad-ish eyesight, so they lower the resolution on their screen.  The result is incredibly ugly.  Unfortunately resolution independent display seems to be a forgotten goal in modern OSes, so having screens that can change res is definitely worthwhile.",1389178311

It wasn&#x27;t a big time commitment, was pretty low-stress, and I didn&#x27;t mind it. Was nice to get a taste for working at what is a very unique company (everyone is remote, nobody uses email, no product managers). I didn&#x27;t think of it as a crappy paid gig. If anything I thought of the payment as a little perk. Basically a way to make this little project approach legal. On the other hand I already had some good insight into the company, having a couple of good friends work there, and having chatted with Matt a couple times. So I was predisposed to think this is a good place to work and worth the effort. I was also really intrigued with the idea of a fully remote workforce and was very interested to learn how they manage that. So I actually saw value in doing the project beyond the payment or the whole &quot;get a job&quot; thing.<p>I think the other key part is that they&#x27;re not just evaluating you on the bit of work that you&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s largely about your communication during the project. If you just took the project and banged out a perfect feature without talking to anyone or asking questions, I&#x27;m guessing you wouldn&#x27;t get an offer. In order to make an all-remote workforce work, communication is incredibly important. &quot;Communication is oxygen&quot; is the mantra at Automattic. And the channels we use for it are IRC and our yammer-like system. We rarely talk to each other and almost never use email. That&#x27;s really non-standard, and you can&#x27;t easily get a feel for that in an interview or with pair-programmed fizzbuzz.<p>In many ways, I think working at Automattic is somewhat similar to contributing to an open source project (to be fair, I haven&#x27;t done a ton of this). And that makes sense, given its roots in and continued investment in open source. In fact when one developer asked if we could open source a particular component, Matt&#x27;s response was that he was pretty much ok with open sourcing everything except our passwords. Given how open source works -- your voice in a project basically equals your investment and contribution to it -- I think the paid-project interview makes some sense in that light.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m kinda responding to a few posts here, but I hope that gives a little more background into the process.",1389177421

Articles such as this one, as well as articles on &#x27;consuming devices killing creativity&#x27;, &#x27;bite-sized articles keeping us from reading bigger material like books&#x27;, &#x27;our school system turning us into automatons&#x27;, and so on.<p>While I find myself agreeing with some of these articles based on my observation of myself and others, I can&#x27;t help but wonder to what degree they actually apply to &#x27;the larger population&#x27;.<p>All these people mindlessly consuming memes on their devices could be creating something new instead. That&#x27;s wasted potential. But would they in any other time period, faced with the societal dangers of those times, be any more creative?<p>All these people reading bite-sized articles could be reading meatier material instead. Again, wasted potential. But there was a time were much of these people couldn&#x27;t even read, or didn&#x27;t have access to much information, so any reading and awareness of the world at large by chunks of the population is a win anyways.<p>And before we had schools, didn&#x27;t most people follow some other kind of pre-determined path that shaped them to function appropriately in their respective societies, losing potential in the process?<p>Basically, when discussing these supposed problems, are they really problems, or do these things just fall short of what we can imagine, some potential that we project on the entire population (which is not a bad reason for discussing them, of course)? Isn&#x27;t it the case that in any time period there are only smaller subsections of people who create, research, and/or people who are autodidacts that eschew a traditional education for something different?<p>Would those of us who are amusing ourselves to death not simply do something else &#x27;mindless&#x27; in previous generations?",1389176423

And poorly designed systems.<p>Anyone with a correct understanding of the problem domain would know you have to cope with missing plates by indicating they are missing and not by using (many) different sentinel values.  The fact each city/county/state uses a different value indicates the whole ticket processing system is a screwed up mess.<p>The North American system of plates essentially identifying a person and not a vehicle is weird.  The UK still allows vanity plates but they are bound to the vehicle (and to a current keeper - when you sell it the plates go with the vehicle to the new keeper unless you make special arrangements).  I still find it odd to take the plates off a vehicle being sold and to have to get them put on to the new one.<p>A vehicle without plates in violation of traffic/parking laws should be towed (or in some places it could be blown up as a security threat - Northern Ireland that used to be a regular event and a joy-riders post-drive fun to remove the plates and wait for the fireworks).<p>At least if it is towed, the fines can be sorted out before the return of the vehicle rather than wasting time (and money) on a no-hope chase of some unidentifiable owner unless some schmuck happens to have a vanity plate matching your chosen sentinel value [in which case you then have the extra expense of wasting time cancelling the ticket or even wasting court time before it gets dismissed].",1389175654

In practice they are experts in lobbying, nothing else. The salary comes from a company that has a certain interest and pays the lobbying organisation to get this result through the politicians. The bribery is not actually exchanging with the politician, it&#x27;s with the lobying organisation. Bribery would have been more understanding, here it&#x27;s just a question of stupidity sadly. The lobbying groups are confusedly just taking the money and wondering why it&#x27;s so easy.

Either we should prevent that, or consider placing a cap on maximum per-capita economic power (preferably as a factor of the average, not unlike the Swiss proposal for CEO salaries).<p>A person should be able to buy as many yachts, castles or private jets as he wants, but using his money to lobby, campaign or otherwise influence political process -- perhaps that should be severely limited?<p>Civilization and technology today allows individual human beings to wield far higher concentrations of power than our psychology evolved to deal with.

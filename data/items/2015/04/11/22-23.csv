I think in years past some have been Java, but I&#x27;ve not yet seen a HTML5 game in use on the big sites as played here.<p>Since my family doesn&#x27;t pay money into these games, their style involves playing broad coverage of games:  They play each for a little bit until the life meter runs out, and often try new games.  Again, 100% have been flash.<p>There are also tools & frameworks like Starling for converting either AS3 code, Flash assets, or full SWF files to other non-Flash platforms.  For instance, I wrote the sorting algorithm in as3isolib, and noticed that Ubisoft ported one of their games using it to iOS, using Starling.<p>Flash is certainly alive and well.",1428793151

IIUC that&#x27;s the strongest argument so far against sequential consistency by default, yet I&#x27;m not sure I understand their evidence. I haven&#x27;t followed their references yet, but after reading their arguments I&#x27;m not sure just what the overhead is now, and what they expect it to be in the future (tbh, I would have expected them to be much clearer about this point, since it is so crucial). They say they expect the overhead to be reduced substantially to the point of not being worth caring about, but is that actually true/likely? I&#x27;m not familiar with this enough to judge on my own. My suspicion here is that they (cheekily) say that the overhead <i>can</i> be reduced, without having to prove that it <i>will</i> be reduced.<p>The alternative, if it is genuinely more expensive to implement SC guarantees in hardware, is that we simply stop teaching people that &quot;A;B&quot; means A is executed <i>and then</i> B. Maybe there really should be an exception saying &quot;but nobody is allowed to look at any intermediate states, unless explicitly allowed&quot;. We could also just teach the full meaning of it from the start, it can&#x27;t be that difficult.

9361147,comment,9360827,9360827,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Edit: I was wrong about OpenBSD ports on several counts, it seems. OpenBSD seems to have corrected several omissions in package management that I&#x27;ve seen in the past; some of these changes seem to have come recently, in version 5.5. I&#x27;m reading docs now to see which of these issues have been resolved.<p>Lest anyone be misled into believing ports is comparable to yum or apt...it is not.<p>With ports it is not only possible, but likely, that you will end up with upgrades to some software that can break other pieces of your system, because the dependencies often do not account for things, like compile flags, which can be changed by the user at install time. This leads to a very fragile system a couple years down the road, after a bunch of upgrades and new software installation has occurred. This isn&#x27;t theoretical; I&#x27;ve seen it happen more often than not in my very limited use of the ports system...it is avoidable, but it is not obvious or well-documented how to avoid it, and adds not insignificant costs to maintaining your systems.<p>With ports it is not possible to verify that the files installed by the port match what was originally installed. This can be useful for security purposes (i.e. has the ps command been tampered with?) or for troubleshooting purposes (i.e. did someone install a program from a source tarball over the original package, or did permissions/ownership change?). <i>Edit: I was wrong on this one. pkg_check verifies package contents against checksums, which is comparable to rpm -V or debsums.</i><p>With ports, it is not possible to reliably roll-back to a prior version in-place (i.e. without uninstalling everything, and then reinstalling it).<p>With ports, it is likely you will, over time, end up with multiple versions of some things (libraries, languages, etc.) installed. This is common on Linux, as well, but the ability to determine what is built against which versions, and to be able to keep up with whether, say, an insecure version can be removed without breaking things on the system, is much weaker (non-existent, as far as I can tell).<p>OpenBSD has many fine qualities and very smart people working on it, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the dumbest idea ever to use it. But, ports is simply not a sufficient answer to the package management problem. RPM/yum and dpkg/apt are not perfect, but they are vastly superior to ports in every dimension. FreeBSD now has pkgng which is very much a move in the right direction, and it would be definite progress for OpenBSD to adopt it.<p>Note that providing binaries or not is not on my list of complaints about ports, above. Somehow, in every conversation about ports failings as a package manager, there will always be people talking about binaries, and how you can totally install binaries with ports and so there&#x27;s no reason to not like ports. I find it annoyingly time-consuming to build everything from scratch, but it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker. Providing binary packages is not why apt and yum are vastly superior to ports.",1428792725

Since then, every single interaction I&#x27;ve had with the police here has been overwhelmingly positive.<p>I once ran a red light on my bike in a really stupid way and came very close to getting myself killed. Cop on a motorbike pulled next to me and said &quot;I think you&#x27;d better pull over, sunshine&quot; (literally, I thought it was so brilliant I still remember the words).

There was a protest march and the cop said that I wasn&#x27;t allowed to walk at the same pace if I was on the footpath. Told her I lived on the street (which I did) and was going to follow along with the march until my house.<p>At that point she tapped my foot as I walked so I would fall over. I was a bit surprised, then she did it again. After 2 or 3 attempts I hit the ground and was then bundled against the wall.

If you are in a car and stop the engine, the air and tires drag will make you stop, a lot of snow will make you stop. Viscosity stop things, because it&#x27;s related to the speed and makes the speed smaller until you stop. Perhaps not everyone can write the equation, but there are some underlying properties of the possible equations there. The important part is that if you draw speed vs time you get<p><pre><code>  s|--\\n   |   \----\\n   |         \-------\\n   |                  \-----------\\n   |                               \--------\n  -+----------------------------------------\n   |                                t\n</code></pre>\nThe Higgs / mass don&#x27;t make you stop.

More air viscosity makes your car stop in less time.<p>The mass of the car changes the acceleration, the 0-60 mph time. When the car is stopped, more mass makes more difficult to change the speed from 0 and reach 60mph. When you go at 60mph the mass is not so important, until you try to turn or stop.

Here is the process I follow.<p>For each subject in which I am interested, I maintain a bibliography. The most common way entries are added here is by discovering references to books or articles in other things I am reading.<p>When reading books in physical media, I usually draw an arrow by references or notes that indicate books I should add to these bibliographies. When I am done with a book or article, I go back through and add any such references that still seem relevant to my bibliography. (I do this at the same time I am transcribing notes and quotations, files of which are also an important part of my system.) I usually include a brief note on why I believe this work will be of value and where I got the reference.<p>Where this becomes useful is when I am pursuing some sort of study. I have learned that I study best with some object in view, so even if my study is for general education, I prepare a syllabus that presents objectives of some sort (code to write, questions to answer, etc.).<p>Once I have the objectives prepared, I use my living bibliography files to create a reading plan. Of course, once I really delve into a subject, that plan usually expands and I add more references into both my general bibliography and reading plan.<p>This process provides me an apparatus to pursue my interests in a structured way to make the most of my time. I don&#x27;t worry much about what to read next except in the context of some such study.<p>I have found that without this sort of structure to focus my reading, I am in danger of becoming a dilettante. I don&#x27;t have an exceptional memory, and if I read without a structure, I easily fall into the trap of cultivating superficial knowledge without ever getting deep enough to answer substantive questions or do original work.<p>I do, however, want to encourage serendipity, so I subscribe to and read periodicals in variety of fields. I have also found The London Review of Books and book reviews in leading newspapers to be useful sources of references and lines of thought that I would probably never otherwise discover.",1428790730

When you hire someone and you have to choose between different people, then a normal HR manager will choose the one that is less noisy. They are not looking for someone who does the right thing, but someone who will provide more value to the company than trouble.<p>The only thing you haven&#x27;t mentioned that might be relevant is if your silence might hurt someone.

No longer am I interrupted randomly, while in deep thought. I don&#x27;t veer off to the break room for coffee, and get caught up in conversations. I don&#x27;t take excessive lunch breaks to stand in lines at a restaurant. Speaking of, it helps the waistline! I have easy access to my full kitchen at home. I digress.....<p>Anyway, my team is located in central time, so I reap the benefit of distraction free coding between 2PM and 7PM pacific time.<p>I typically wake up, sit down at my desk at 9AM, and begin my daily routine of checking email, checking out what&#x27;s new via HN, catching any meetings with folks in the central timezone, etc. Once lunch comes, I take a break, and begin planning what I want to accomplish in my 2-7 distraction free time block.<p>So, while I do work a full 8 hours, only about 4-5 hours of that time is spent head down in code.<p>Point is, I certainly agree working 4:30 is probably sufficient, however, for me, I do utilize the other hours of the day to &quot;socialize&quot; and plan &quot;big picture&quot; with my colleagues via video conference.

How about the mental and emotional toll that being involved in a court case can take?  Don&#x27;t doubt that there is one.  These are all costs to you.<p>This may be too simplistic and quite conservative, but if you are not personally involved in the legal case, nor the actions that were taken which were illegal, then it is the company&#x27;s problem and not your own.  I like to hope the legal system was designed to get to the bottom of the issue, which has already been identified.<p>From a career or personal perspective, it might be a better idea to stay out of it unless you must be involved, either because it is needed to serve justice or because it is required because you are subpoenaed.  Why not let the court decide if that is needed?  One thing I know for sure is, if one side or the other needs/wants you bad enough, you will get dragged into it.<p>On the other side, if you don&#x27;t need to be involved, it is probably safer to stay on the sideline.  Especially if there is any chance that you aren&#x27;t sure about the legality of the issues involved.  Why take the unnecessary risk and burden to yourself?  The company probably wouldn&#x27;t do that for you.<p>As for your career question - I think most reasonable employers may ask, but would realize that the actions of a corporation do not equal those of an individual working at that corporation.  I do think your career can survive being associated with such an entity, even if you have to be involved.<p>Worst case, change the entry on your resume to make the company name anonymous when applying for jobs... instead of XYZ, Corp, just say &quot;A Major Consumer Technology Firm&quot;, etc.  I have seen folks do that and it is not totally unacceptable.<p>Good luck with your decision.",1428790091

These tools are actually updated more frequently than ever before, probably because developers using these platforms are reaching record numbers, and Adobe can see that in their Creative Cloud usage metrics. Their deliberate strategy of killing the plugin on mobile to pivot their focus into AIR must have paid off. Adobe&#x27;s development process for Flash and AIR used to be a bit opaque, but they now release new public betas multiple times per month, listen to requests for changes, and disclose the projected development timeline for new features.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if the spirit of the article resonated with people here who hate Flash, but it is utterly vapid clickbait. It&#x27;s a tired exercise in kludging together derogatory illustrative phrases to paint the chosen target in a bad light, with nothing driving the negativity other than the author&#x27;s wishful thinking. The author actually admits he has nothing to support his title when he states &quot;this story isn&#x27;t about how or why Flash is dying: It&#x27;s about why we have to remember it&quot; and proceeds to spend the next 13 paragraphs whining about how sites like The Wayback Machine haven&#x27;t archived enough SWF files.<p>The title (which the article does absolutely nothing to even attempt to support) implies an urgent and imminent threat to the existence of Flash, that perhaps major desktop browser vendors have unanimously agreed to ban the Flash plugin or that they decided to get rid of plugin support altogether. Of course, this is ridiculous, and as long as desktop browsers still support plugins, Flash is not going anywhere.",1428790056

While he was working their they sped it up by 25% and management was happy happy joy joy. The workers were getting run ragged though and after a few weeks the defect rate started creeping up. After a few months the defect rate was so high that they were producing less finished product than when the line speed was slower. Took another year for the plant manager to get fired and bring in a guy who turned the line speed back down.<p>The other is the first place I worked their were two younger coders and they were being flogged to work 9-10 hours days, basically being given unreasonable deadlines. After a few years they burned out and the company fired them. Twenty years later both of them are still damaged. I did some of the same, hurt my wrist, which is still a little messed up.

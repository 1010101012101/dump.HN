7521417,comment,7519827,7520754,8,0,Twisol,,,"You are conflating the limiting behavior of a function with the value of a function. In (standard) analysis, there is no actual value called infinity - it&#x27;s just used to describe how a function behaves arbitrarily close to a given value.<p>When you have a 0^0 limiting form (or 0/0, or 0 * infinity), the function&#x27;s behavior is indeterminate. The &quot;0&quot; and &quot;infinity&quot; you&#x27;re looking at aren&#x27;t precisely 0 or infinity, but only arbitrarily close. The actual behavior of the function depends on the expressions that approach 0 and infinity, hence `x/(x+1)` and `x/e^x` having different limiting behaviors as x increases without bound.<p>But if you are literally considering the function at a specific point which produces a so-called indeterminate form, the answer is simpler. In some cases, the function is undefined (e.g. 1/x where x=0). In the case of 0^0, there is a precise value we can assign: 1. And this doesn&#x27;t conflict with the 0^0 limiting form: the limit of a function at a point can be different from the actual value of the function at said point.<p>A quote of Knuth, taken from Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation#Zero_to_the_power_of_zero"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation#Zero_to_the_powe...</a>):<p>> Knuth (1992) contends strongly that 0^0 &quot;has to be 1&quot;, drawing a distinction between the <i>value</i> 0^0, which should equal 1 as advocated by Libri, and the <i>limiting form</i> 0^0 (an abbreviation for a limit of f(x)^g(x) where f(x), g(x) -> 0), which is necessarily an indeterminate form as listed by Cauchy: &quot;Both Cauchy and Libri were right, but Libri and his defenders did not understand why truth was on their side.&quot;",1396510323

7521410,comment,7519827,7521266,0,0,einhverfr,,,"> This does not break algebra any more than, say, restricting the domain of the square root (when working in the reals) to non-negative numbers.<p>Sure it does, because if that is the case, you restrict your domain when you divide by a variable expression.  If you divide both sides by x-1, then you effectively rule out 1 from the domain.<p>That&#x27;s the problem.<p>Now this is not the same as 0/0.  The point is that 0/0 is only undefined when it persists <i>after simplification</i> and only because you can&#x27;t define a relationship between the two zeros.<p>I.e. 0/0 is undefined because 2x/x, 52x/x, and x^2/x give you three different answers as x->0.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that every function which has not been reduced and can transiently evauate to 0/0 is treated as non-continuous.<p>Regarding derivatives, this highlights the problem because to solve the first derivative of a variable to a simple exponent, you multiply by the exponent and divide by the variable (x^2 becomes 2x, 2x becomes 2, and so forth).  What this means is that you may be dealing with a limit but the limit defines a function, which is something like 2x^2/x for the derivative of x^2 and 2x/x for the second derivative.<p>Unless you allow simplification <i>before</i> determining whether the function is continuous, these things don&#x27;t make sense.  If you allow reduction first, then x/x^2 is undefined where x = 0, but x/x is not, because you can reduce it to 1 <i>before</i> applying any further logic.  Both may appear to evaluate to 0/0 however.<p>There are a huge number of things that seem to break in algebra and calculus if one treats x/x as non-continuous and undefined.  The simpler solution is to allow reduction to 1 <i>before</i> determining that it is undefined. (of course 52x/x would reduce to 52 instead, again showing why 0/0 is oversimplifying the problem).",1396510177

For the sake of discussion, let&#x27;s assume that person has fantasies about gay unicorns. It just so happens that the state has reverted to fundamentalist ways and such fantasies are now punishable by death. With all this data mining in place, what prevents law enforcement agencies from subpoenaing FB and tapping directly into that data feed and making arrests based on that? I know it&#x27;s a far fetched scenario, but the principle applies to almost anything. Replace gay unicorns with whatever you like.

In each case we are looking at different way to construct a useful mathematic out of different sets of definitions and axioms. Regarding 0^0 there is no clear winner, as - like the blog shows - there are many incompatible advantages one would get from 0^0:=1 or 0^0:=0. With &quot;1+1=2&quot; there is no controversy, as the many different definitions or axioms essentially result in the same nomenclature.<p>But as an example of a rather unintuitive result regarding &quot;1+1&quot; look at the field F_2 (or GF(2)). It has two elements, 0 and 1. So when I&#x27;m writing &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot; I am referring to these elements. Nonetheless with a typical definition used in many branches of mathematics I define 2:=1+1, 3:=1+1+1,… In F_2 the addition operation is defined as 0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, and… 1+1=0. I thus get 0=1+1=2, 1=(1+1)+1=3, 0=((1+1)+1)+1)=4. Note that this is essentially calculation mod 2. But whereas outside of algebra this is often seen as a different set of equalities (&quot;1+1≡0 mod 2&quot;) in algebra F_2 is just another field alongside of the rational, the real and the imaginary numbers.",1396509717

There&#x27;s too much back-patting here on YC, IMO, when people are claiming to be what they are not, or when they write some article about how they &#x27;hacked&#x27; something that actually isn&#x27;t that impressive. Sometimes the bar seems to be set pretty low indeed.<p>I believe part of it is that the general age demographic here is pretty young, and a lot of people have not so much experience working across a range of projects with a large number of people.<p>A year does not an &#x27;engineer&#x27; make, in any field.

I can&#x27;t have packets getting lost in the middle of an SSH session: it just doesn&#x27;t make sense. My keystrokes are a stream of data that must be in order, and must be delivered: thus TCP.<p>Mosh[1] is basically (a better) SSH over UDP. It fares a lot better than SSH on mobile connections.

Zynga, Facebook, and Groupon didn&#x27;t drop because of the share structure, and it&#x27;s disingenuous to suggest that that was a probable reason.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the damage that focus on short term share price wreaks on companies in the long run - it&#x27;s paralyzing, as they&#x27;re forced to focus on the wrong things. Activist shareholders seem to focus on short term returns. Not being subject to that, and being able to focus on long term initiatives seems very beneficial for long term shareholder value as long as you have a good leader.<p>But that good leader caveat is a big one. Multiple share classes might be correlated with having a bad leader.",1396508606

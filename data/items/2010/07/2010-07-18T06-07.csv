MS relies on IP, while Google relies on trade secrets.<p>IP is illegitimate because each concept exists in effectively infinite supply, and therefore cannot be owned anymore than the Pythagorean theorem or the color blue can be owned. _Access_ to a concept, however, can theoretically be owned, since access can only be gained through physical channels (books, bandwidth, oration, etc.), which are inherently limited in volume. Google limits the “supply” of _access_ to its code, while MS (tries to) limit the “supply” of the code itself.<p>So closed source could still exist in an IP-free world.

    trained Intellectual Property (IP) attorney[...]
</code></pre>
Some parts of copyright law, that most people won't ever come anywhere near having to deal with, are complex. The 99.99% that covers what most people do is pretty easy to understand: if you didn't create that song or movie you just copied, don't give away the copy, and don't take copies from people who are not obeying this rule.<p><pre><code>    Musicians could still get paid, even without
    copyright.  They would still be able to sell
    concert tickets, even if they did not make a
    thin dime from CDs and MP3 downloads.

What about musicians whose music does not work well in concert? What about bands like Pink Floyd whose stage shows lost money--they relied on album sales for their money. What about songwriters?<p><pre><code>    Of course, people would still buy CDs, even
    with unrestricted file sharing networks in place.
    If you hear a CD being played in a store, and you
    like it, what are you going to do:

        Spend a few dollars, get a dozen good songs
        in your possession, or

        Spend the next four hours on the Web trying
        to find those songs performed by some obscure
        local artists.

    The answer is obvious.
</code></pre>
There are two fatal flaws with that argument.<p>1. It's not going to take four hours on the web. Right now, it might take four hours on the web to find the songs, because we have IP laws so that sites that want to offer the songs have to operate outside the law. That necessarily causes there to be some difficulty in finding and using them.<p>In the proposed IP-free world of the article, that barrier goes away. Finding the songs on the web will take minutes, not hours.<p>2. Yes, some people will still prefer a CD--even if they can find the songs on the web in minutes, and they will prefer to buy a CD rather than burn their own from downloads. Even if that is a significant number of people, will those people buy CDs <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>artist</i>? In the article's IP-free world, anyone can make and sell CDs. You'd be able to go down to your local CD store and find a third party copy of the ""official"" CD, complete with all the artwork, liner notes, etc., for cheaper than the official CD.",1279434578

1525342,comment,1523858,1523858,0,0,strlen,,,"Yes! In general, when asked ""should I learn X | X is something that gives you a different perspective"" the answer should be yes. In particular, C is excellent as it teaches you things must be understood even if you work with higher level languages: dealing with pointers, dealing with raw memory (allocation, deallocation, finding leaks), dealing with the I/O and VM sub systems of your operating system, understanding abstract data types.<p>On the educational side, you will learn about hardware works. Some will argue that there are better languages to learn these things and I'll agree: Forth could be better for learning about raw memory addresses and systems programming. Scheme could better for learning about data abstraction. However, C has several salient things going for it: C is UNIX (for good or bad, majority of serious non-embedded -- and even great deal of embedded -- programming outside of Microsoft or of Windows Desktop Application development targets UNIX) and C is the lingua franca of programming languages.<p>From the practical side, you will have an advantage too. Higher level languages generally still have pointers (Quiz: is Java pass by value or pass by reference? Answer: It's pass by value, just the value of anything other than the primitive types is a pointer). Higher level languages have built abstractions around I/O and VM but they typically fall under two categories: thin wrappers around C and POSIX APIS (Perl, Python, Ruby) or leaky abstractions that occasionally force you to use FFI to C (JVM based languages). In either case, if you are able to program C you have a competitive advantage against coders brought up purely on those languages.<p>C is also a good language to learn about data structures: partly because learning data structures in C is <i>really</i> about the data structures, abstract data types and algorithms and <i>not</i> (as C++ and Java centric courses often make it out to be) about OO. This is the book I recommend for data structures in C: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Pseudocode-Approach-C/dp/0534951236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Pseudocode-Approach-C/...</a> (I'm biased as I learned from it myself and have had classes taught by Professor Forouzan).<p>Note, I never said anything about performance. Just like it's nearly impossible to hand-write assembly that beats ""gcc -O3"" (not to say ""gcc -O4"" or icc) performance wise on modern hardware (out of order execution, NUMA, specialized instruction sets), I am pretty confident that languages will emerge that will beat C even for things like inner numeric loops by being able to reason more about mutability, side effects or lack thereof, exploiting parallelism and caching available in hardware. You won't be writing in C to make computation faster, you'll be writing in C to deal with I/O, memory and the like more efficiently: many times that will mean your code will run faster, but it won't specifically due to being written in C (to be blunt, it will be due to implements of runtimes and programming languages sheltering the languages/runtimes from the hardware/OS; that may not always be the wrong thing to do). See <a href=""http://pl.atyp.us/wordpress/?p=2947"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pl.atyp.us/wordpress/?p=2947</a> for a great discussion on this.<p>Finally in terms of C++: don't study it <i>before</i> knowing C <i>and</i> a non-C++ object oriented language. I was lucky enough to learn C before learning C++, but it <i>was</i> the first object oriented language I tried to learn. Because of that, I thought of OO as a black art. Oddly enough I truly learned about OO in Perl: I was writing Perl 5 (loosely adhering to Damian Conway's ""Perl Best Practices"") and despite OO in Perl being an ugly hack (it's similar to Python's, but without even the syntactic sugar that hides __dict__ away) the Perl code I was writing was far more OO than any C++ I wrote up until then. I then learned Python and Java; when I came back to writing C++, I was much better at it. Josh Bloch (along with Doug Lea, the author of Java's collections) in ""Coders at Work"" spoke of a similar experience (in his case, he didn't do any OO programming before Java) and likewise speaks very favourably about C.<p>I strongly recommend you do the same: learn C and do a non-trivial project in it (writing a compiler for subset of C in C did the trick for me) to truly grok it; continue building projects in Python (or another OO language e.g., Ruby, Java, Scala, Smalltalk, ObjC, Common Lisp+CLOS; pick as many of these as you'd like) to make sure you have a firm grasp of OO <i>before</i> you go after C++.",1279433902

For instance, I&#x27;m currrently having to route all my iPad web traffic via Charles proxy to remove any instances of style=&quot;overflow:hidden;&quot; in a body tag are cleared out.<p>Why? Because in iOS 9.2 Apple released it with a bug that causes the viewport to zoom incorrectly on these web pages. This affects LibreOffice&#x27;s OpenGrok, which I browsed regularly on my iPad.<p>They still haven&#x27;t fixed this, and it&#x27;s a major regression. iOS updates are few and infrequent. Consequently I&#x27;m seriously questioning what their updates actually do to my iPad and iPhone.",1454662750

They researched this and documented it quite well[1], it also seems to be independently researched in this book I couldn&#x27;t imagine anyone ever read[2] about traffic fonts. Also, that source[2] cites like 3 studies of independent people researching this topic over like a 6 year period.<p>It also seems that this report &#x27;proving&#x27; errors in the testing methodology is not released yet. So, like what the fuck? These dudes(they were all men) spend some time researching various methodologies for developing roadway font, which is probably extremely dull, and then they incorporate their results into a font sepcifically for roadways and the government says it is not effective?<p>That&#x27;s cool, the font is like 175 - 800 bucks per jurisdiction, just say you don&#x27;t want to pay. I mean, this is a massive taxpayer expense probably on par with the rusting helicopters and power plant that can&#x27;t function we built in Iraq(saw that shit on Vice).

Have <i>you</i> ever used the Pirate Bay?<p>Anyway, I crafted my link for comedic value rather than &quot;realism&quot;, and then my point was that someone could put, on a web page in their own full control, a link that points to pirated copyrighted material beyond reasonable doubt. You talk about the difficulty of a site with user-submitted content to place limits on what that content can be, which is relevant if someone proposes draconian copyright enforcement measures, but it does not refute my point. As to PB having non-pirated content - sure, and the red light district probably has businesses that sell food, but PB is like my link example in that nobody would buy a claim that its main use isn&#x27;t pirating copyrighted content.<p>Again - perhaps it&#x27;s reasonable to have laws letting people get away with it because any alternative laws are worse (or we could have no copyright law, etc.) All I&#x27;m saying is, you don&#x27;t have to be completely ignorant to say, hey, there are guys who don&#x27;t only piss into the swimming pool but they do so standing on the springboard, and how about we discuss ways to stop them.<p>Also, and somewhat independently from the above, you mention in a sister comment that you&#x27;re a filmmaker.

Someone trying to live off their own films is in a pretty tight spot right now because basically they compete against a near-infinite amount of de-facto free-as-in-beer content. You mention that Hollywood is alive and well but many in Hollywood disagree, it hurts them a lot - as to someone with a smaller budget, making a profit is unlikely. I don&#x27;t know how matters could be better, though perhaps if it were illegal to sell/give up the authors&#x27; rights, and if we&#x27;d be forced to pay per view or some such, and the enforcement of it all was practical, things <i>would</i> be better.

The original testing methodology for the test is actually fairly well documented[1] and the font was designed by Donald Meeker, Terminal Deisgn agency[2][3] and some people from Pensylvania and Texas transportation/highway admin roles[3]. There is more on this topic in the citylab article[5] but it turns out Meeker developed and tested the font. Meeker, for his part says:<p><i>“Helen Keller can tell you from the grave that Clearview looks better,”</i><p>and thinks it could be a matter of cost according to the article[5]. TerminalFonts posted a hilarious tweet about it as well[4]. They seemed to have done a decent job researching it, and it was not as cut and dry as simply an a/b test with old signs, but it was rigorously documented. Although, I find reading font testing methodology absurdly boring so I skimmed it. Not really sure what the cost to the government was, but they are certainly killing the font according to every source.<p>According to the citylab article:<p><i>The FHWA has not yet provided any research on Clearview that disproves the early claims about the font’s benefits.</i><p>So, I have to apologize, I briefly insinuated that maybe these guys forged the test to get the contract. Instead, they seem like pretty passionate design nerds who meticulously researched this topic and then developed a font around their findings.<p>Apparently, they did a poor job though, according to some unreleased report.<p>[1]<a href=""http://clearviewhwy.com/ResearchAndDesign/_articles/TRB_Paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clearviewhwy.com/ResearchAndDesign/_articles/TRB_Pape...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.terminaldesign.com/web-fonts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.terminaldesign.com/web-fonts/</a>\n[3]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearview_(typeface)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearview_(typeface)</a>\n[4]<a href=""https://twitter.com/TerminalDesign/status/693173610538799105"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/TerminalDesign/status/693173610538799105</a><p>[5]<a href=""http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/01/official-united-states-highway-sign-font-clearview/427068/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/01/official-united-state...</a><p>PRICING from www.citylab.com<p>==============<p>Jurisdictions that adopt Clearview must purchase a standard license for type, a one-time charge of between $175 (for one font) and $795 (for the full 13-font typeface family) and up, depending on the number of workstations.

There&#x27;s a decent chance that it wasn&#x27;t related to espionage. There&#x27;s also a smaller chance that it was espionage gone awry, but I highly doubt state level actors are that clumsy.<p>If it was espionage it was probably intentional. To what end I&#x27;m not sure. Attempts to interfere with the interview seem pointless at best, at least for the sake of interference itself. Probably some sort of psychological game or intimidation.

In this case I&#x27;m pretty much wasted by the time they go to bed and can only sustain imgur or netflix for a bit before I go to sleep. The other option is to realise that it&#x27;s better for everyone if I get some time for myself as well, so I take it. Some evenings I don&#x27;t spend time with the kids for example and don&#x27;t do anything much else either. In this case the next day I&#x27;m full of ideas and excited to try new stuff and I see that everyone around me is also better off due to this.<p>So, for me the lesson has been - learn to take time for yourself.

11040195,comment,11039402,11040173,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> How does the latter lead to the former?<p>Debasing your currency is, by definition, inflation. Debasing your currency means that the value of the currency drops, such that the same amount of currency buys a smaller amount of whatever (for example, if $30 will get you a barrel of oil today, but only 60% of a barrel tomorrow, the dollar has been debased). Inflation means that the same thing costs more money (for example, if a barrel of oil costs $30 today, but $50 tomorrow, we&#x27;re seeing inflation in the dollar, as reflected in the oil price). As you might notice, those are two different ways to frame exactly the same pricing information.<p>(The reason we have two terms is (at least in part) that they arose from different historical circumstances -- debasing a metal currency meant, e.g., taking what were supposed to be gold coins and mixing a base metal into them, so that your new coins weighed just as much as they should but were worth less (since they contained less gold).)<p>So, the mechanism is: they are the same thing.",1454659223

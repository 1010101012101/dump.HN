2267338,comment,2267203,2267203,0,0,reeses,,,"I have a feeling the young adult fiction area (where this author is focused) is where much of the ebook money is coming from in general(but it's going to balloon everywhere).  I can see how serial authors who get kids hooked on their series can have a nicely incrementing revenue stream.  I'm sure you can think of a couple examples of traditionally published YA fiction that have long lines of fans loyally paying top dollar for hardcover versions of the newest volume.<p>There was an article earlier this month in the NYT (web version: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/books/05ebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/books/05ebooks.html</a>) with some observations on children consuming ebook content.<p>""At HarperCollins, for example, e-books made up 25 percent of all young-adult sales in January, up from about 6 percent a year before — a boom in sales that quickly got the attention of publishers there.""<p>And that's from the publishing 'house' example.<p>The NYT article also observes that a lot of kids are getting ebook readers as gifts.  When a grandparent/aunt/uncle can't think of a specific book to give a kid for their birthday or whatever, rather than give them a piece of junk toy or unwanted clothes, they can buy an ebook reader, maybe with a small Amazon gift certificate or a DVD full of formatted Gutenberg texts.<p>I can only imagine it will be a short time before the author's age falls even further for some of these stories of young writers making money.  I could see the clever goth girl in junior high pounding out a thin book a month and self-publishing for $.99.[1]  Ebooks have disconnected the feeling of ""value"" and ""heft"" of a book, which publishers have been inadvertently reinforcing for years with the hard/soft cover versions of books.<p>As with the Twilight (although, not so much with the Harry Potter) books I mentioned earlier, our idea of ""quality"" isn't necessarily important to hook kids.  If it's escapist literature with a character with whom a kid can identify, you could pull a George Lucas (oh look, another one) and use Joseph Campbell's Hero with a Thousand Faces as a money-printing machine.<p>[1] What a perfect time, too: take the last few years of your livejournal blog, put it into chapters, and format it for the Kindle.",1298783347
2267337,comment,2266640,2266920,0,0,tzs,,,"And as clocks started showing up everywhere, that transition to and from daylight savings time became very annoying as we had to manually adjust a dozen clocks.<p>I was in college shortly after the digitization of everything started (Caltech, class of '82). I took a course in digital logic. I don't remember the name of the textbook, but I remember the last chapter (or perhaps it was an appendix) and the TERRIFIC advice it gave--still relevant today.<p>The title was ""The Engineer as Dope Pusher"". It talked about how engineers want to do fun things, and so if not careful will end up pushing things into products that don't belong there, because the engineer wants to play with them. For example, suppose you are an engineer designing the timer for a dryer. On the one hand, you can use the common mechanical timer, with the circular dial. This thing is cheap (because they've been manufactured essentially unchanged for decades and so the process is highly optimized), and it is reliable (again, decades of experience have worked all the bugs out), and consumers all know how to use them.<p>But you've been reading about these new-fangled micro-controllers. Those sounds a hell of lot more fun than a 50 year old mechanical timer. If you go with a micro-controller, you'll get to play with something new. You'll get to write software. Maybe display the time remaining with an LED progress bar, and you can do some neat animations on it to signal completion. Maybe implement a bunch of different drying modes.<p>Never mind that your fancy micro-controller based dryer interface offers no advantage at all to the consumer or the manufacturer. Instead, it costs more for the parts. It involves many more parts--the micro-controller logic board, a power supply, the progress display, the input buttons whereas the old mechanical timer was two parts (the timer, and the dial). The parts are more expensive. It is harder to assemble them. The consumer knows how to use the old system--the new system will probably require them to actually read the manual (oh, someone has to write a new manual). The fancy system might also be less reliable (more parts to break, and the manufacturer does not have experience with running digital electronics in the environment of a dryer).<p>Software engineers in particular have a tendency to become dope pushers, from what I've seen.",1298783318

I'm sure there were dozens, if not hundreds, of other aspiring CS students around the US who spent a few days dreaming about websites that would look a lot like Facebook, had they come to fruition.<p>Having the idea of a dating website that focuses on a specific community, like Harvard, does not entitle you to exact payment from every other person who implements a dating website -- let alone Facebook, which was not primarily a dating website.<p>If you care to debate that point in a more general sense, I'd like to know your opinion on business method patents before proceeding.<p>The question of Zuckerberg's motive in not shutting out the Winklevoss twins as soon as he began work on the Facebook project is debatable. If you take the idea presented in the film that Zuckerberg is not primarily motivated by money, I can understand why he didn't really think about the consequences of what he was doing. By not ending their relationship immediately, he could have seen himself as keeping doors open for himself, rather than shutting them out of competition. It seems unlikely that the Winklevoss twins could have successfully created a competitor website, considering how long it had taken them to develop what they had.<p>This is especially plausible because we're talking about undergraduates messing around in their dorm rooms here.

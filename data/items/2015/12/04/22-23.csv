The problem with this strategy, is in very few cases they were market leaders - many of their non-computer products (and arguably even in their computer products) they were an also-ran.<p>Instead Apple is targeting a much narrower breadth of products and going instead after deep category penetration:<p>Need an Phone? we&#x27;ve got three sizes and price points.<p>Need an Tablet? we&#x27;ve got 3 sizes, and four price points.<p>Need a Laptop? we&#x27;ve got 3 sizes, and four price points.<p>Need a Desktop? we&#x27;ve got 3 form factors, and eight price points.<p>Each of these things is just a computer however, not a whole new category like CTI and printers.

I dont see how hiding complexity inside containers actually reduces the overall complexity of the system.

Frankly most people are unlikely to be bothered by a laggy UI. This applies to programmers as well.

At first, you have no idea how to do it.<p>What would you do:<p>* Go through all of the code related to that functionality, learn by yourself what it does and how it works. In this case you spend a day maybe learning the code.<p>* Ask somebody to explain what you have to do in this task, how things related to that functionality work, what code you can reuse, what code you have to develop from scratch. In this case you spend 20 minutes talking to your colleague and about hour modifying the code in exact places your colleague told you",1437389990

It was basically the anchor currency for most European countries. Germany changed it monetary politics? Everybody tried to follow. It was like the Euro, just with different currencies and a pact to keep the exchange rates stable. Main difference: the monetary policy was made by the German Bundesbank and not the ECB. Though both are in Frankfurt/Germany, the ECB is an European institution.",1437389947

9915161,comment,9914509,9914509,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Hasn&#x27;t this been covered through the Utilities, already? Most utilities here allow you to buy different plans, normal electricity, or electricity generated from renewable sources. At the end of the day it&#x27;s just a &#x27;accounting trick&#x27;, as it&#x27;s not like the green energy is being routed specifically to you, you get the same energy, most of it from a coal burning plant, but your payments are earmarked (in the accounting) to pay for existing or new green energy projects, and you hope they&#x27;re audited such that this is actually true (as opposed to selling 15% of their electricity as &#x27;green&#x27; when their green sources are only 5% and growing slowly).<p>And this isn&#x27;t even any different from having your own solar, unless you&#x27;re in a remote location unconnected to the grid and uninterested in interconnecting to the grid. Most people who have solar simply get two energy meters. One of your power being generated and going to the grid (not to your own home), and one of power from the grid going into your home. It&#x27;s pretty rare that you actually use the energy that the panels on your roof generate. Which means that whether those panels are on your own roof, or on the other side of the planet, doesn&#x27;t really make any difference as long as they cost the same and have the same sun conditions. Except of course for the fact your home rises in value with panels on them because panels are essentially a small currency printer that takes sunlight as its ink, which has value.<p>Which brings me to the weirdness of this project. People with roofs get free panels and some free electricity. And people without roofs have to pay for that, which is obviously going to be quite expensive. Residential solar is already 2x, almost 3x as expensive as industrial solar projects, plus solar is still more expensive than your utility in the first place, and then you have to pay for extra panels for someone else&#x27;s energy bill, plus the panels you do pay for aren&#x27;t owned by you and don&#x27;t add value to your home, and of course the energy of the panels doesn&#x27;t even go directly to you, or hell even directly to the person whose house&#x27;s panels you&#x27;re paying for. I don&#x27;t see why this would be a better idea than buying solar credits, shares in an industrial solar farm or green energy from your utility. It sounds like a waste of money to me, magnifying the very concern that is keeping solar from taking over the energy market.<p>For example that&#x27;s what vandebron.nl does here in the Netherlands. They essentially sell green energy credits (I call them credits not because it&#x27;s not green energy, but because it&#x27;s delivered to the grid in general, and not to them specifically) to consumers by facilitating the financial link between independent producers (e.g. a farmer who has a wind turbine and who can sell to 600 households) and the consumer.",1437389932

I have bank accounts in the UK, US, and Spain and in terms of saving money and transferring it there&#x27;s usually no problem. Where it is localised is borrowing money against property. If you want a mortgage against a Spanish flat you have to use a Spanish bank and so on. That kind of makes sense as if you run off and don&#x27;t pay the mortgage then the bank is stuck with the property and it&#x27;s easier to deal with one down the road where you know the laws and regulations than one in some random other country.

9915153,comment,9913943,9913943,0,0,jackgavigan,,,"I think the difference between the dot-com boom and today is that back in the &#x27;90s, companies that were essentially speculative ideas with no proven market were receiving high valuations, whereas today companies that are targeting a proven market are receiving high valuations because they need to raise (and spend) a lot of money in order to successfully penetrate the market and grow quickly enough to achieve the economies of scale they need to compete effectively.<p>Marc Lore&#x27;s a good bet for this particular market. He&#x27;s already built a successful e-commerce company from scratch and sold it to Amazon. It appears that his plan for Jet.com is to tailor prices for each individual shopper in real-time, effectively targeting a profit margin of 0%. People in the US are familiar with the Costco/Sam&#x27;s Club retail model (i.e. where you pay a membership fee to access discounted prices), and real-time, personalised pricing is incredibly powerful. You get to price off an individually-defined demand curve for each customer, and if people get familiar/comfortable with discounts that are applied to a shopping basket, rather than individual items, you reduce the competitive impact of a low price advertised by your competitor.<p>Also, it looks like Jet.com plans to operate as a marketplace as well as a traditional e-commerce company: <a href=""https://developer.jet.com/getting-started"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.jet.com/getting-started</a>",1437389776

Also, the Euro just lost a ton of value due to QE, which will ultimately drop every Eurozone member&#x27;s GDP by at least 20% in real terms. In dollar terms, Germany&#x27;s economy has plunged since 2008 due to this effect.<p>It&#x27;s the same effect the US suffered as US budget deficits hammered the dollar from 2001-2009 or so. If you look at any country&#x27;s GDP priced in dollars, they all universally skyrocket at the exact same time, all courtesy of the devalued dollar (the US lost a lot of ground to the rest of the world over that time due to the dollar devaluation).<p>Population growth is not a requirement for GDP growth. It also doesn&#x27;t always help, plenty of countries have historically shown vast population growth with mediocre economic growth.<p>Germany&#x27;s population has hardly budged since 1970.

Also, sudo has features that are required in some enviroments, like LDAP or PAM support.<p>I definitely agree that the direction they are going in is great: a lean base system that has as little attack surface as possible and covers 95% of the use cases. If you do need extra functionality, get it from ports.<p>One thing I wonder about though is: why does a system which goal is security still use C for utilities/programs that are not really CPU-bound? Maybe it&#x27;s time to slowly ditch C for a safer language where possible? (There are languages that would fit in quite well with OpenBSD, except that they require some portability work.)",1437386837

Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence.  Claiming that all grains are toxic when uncooked is an extraordinary claim.<p>As I said, I have no doubt that many of these claims are true.  I also have no doubt that some are false.  The author gives me no basis for knowing which is which.  I happen to be a bit of a nutrition and health nut (vegetarian for 14 years, vegan occasionally, avoid processed foods generally), but I'm also a believer in science.  The often ill-informed assertions of some random dude on the Internet are not going to convince me to eat like a cave man.",1189745430

But also, the price of building and maintaining roads is mind-blowingly high.  <p>What if we built a track system, like a single rail roller coaster.  The single rail would be fairly cheap to make, take up minimal space, eliminate the need for everyone to have their own cars, intersections, speed limits, snow plows, collisions, gasoline, human drivers, traffic, etc.  <p>I think it would be an awesome solution all around.  There would probably need to be some significant engineering behind designing that single track system that allowed so much track hopping and to handle cars smart enough not navigate the web.  But I think its nothing we can't do with current technology.<p>Is this stupid?  Most non-tech people seem to think so. ",1189743997

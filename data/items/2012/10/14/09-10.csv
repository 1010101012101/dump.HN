[...] total disbursements would be $431 billion.  [...] $245 billion handed to U.S. and foreign banks.  [...] $169 billion has been paid back.""<p>And here are the latest numbers: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveschaefer/2012/10/11/cbo-updates-tarp-tally-24b-cost-to-taxpayers-14b-from-aig-bailout/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveschaefer/2012/10/11/cbo-upd...</a><p>""the latest update from the Congressional Budget Office projects the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) will ultimately wrap up at a cost of $24 billion.""<p>""The ultimate losses from TARP will not come from that first round of spending, as all of those initial bank investments have been repaid, but instead from the use of TARP funds to help smaller banks (minimally), as well as the extension of the program to pump $79 billion into automakers General Motors and Chrysler and contribute to the bailout of insurer American International Group.""",1350208731

Great camera-recording, WiFi, 3.5mm audio plug, good looking, slim. Maybe not a competitor to the iPhone 3g but I felt it was on par with Android devices at the time, and available at only ~260 without contract.<p>This feeling lasted for 5 minutes, then it crashed. And it crashed again. And again. 20-30 times that night as I tried different features, before I just gave up. I started to regret my purchase.<p>It got better over the following year with updates but it never fully stopped to crash. Often it would crash while playing music, which really sucks for a phone sold to me as THE music smartphone. By June 2010 I had switched to a HTC Desire (which I'm still happy with, now with a custom ROM).<p>It is interesting to read in this post-mortem that 'Testability' was really hard on Symbian, and that problems or bad choices on how e.g. email polling should work, that must have been caught by engineering, somehow slipped through the cracks into the hands of customers.<p>If testability had been easy and quality the highest prio at Nokia, then the 5630 could have been the phone I still use, and I would have recommended it to friends back then instead of saying 'Stay clear!'. I might even have considered buying another Nokia phone. Things could have been different.",1350208219

The best example would be a guy called Pewdiepie[1], he makes gaming videos and does something like 5 million views per day (which is probably around $10k revenue assuming he has a good deal...). He isn't alone, there's quite a few others approaching his level of success.<p>Something a lot of people seem to forget too is for every video they put out their old videos still get views. It's like investments, the money they make compounds over time because for every new video that's more and more views. So as their viewership grows, so does their previous video views and so do their potential views for the future. Even if someone ""only"" does 10,000,000 views from <i>new</i> videos in a month they can still be doing substantial revenue from old videos. This is how some of the bigger channels work, they produce incredibly popular videos every couple of months and fill the time with smaller videos.<p>A good example of that would be Captain Sparklez [2], a guy that makes video game music and commentaries, his music videos can do anywhere from 10 million to 70 million views and he then produces game play commentaries between his bigger hits.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/pewdiepie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/pewdiepie</a>  \n[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/CaptainSparklez/videos?sort=p&flow=grid&view=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/CaptainSparklez/videos?sort=p&#3...</a>",1350205824

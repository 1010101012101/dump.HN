Less and less retail are staying in the markets because of the volatility.<p>So I don't know if it will get cheaper to buy and hold.  It will definitely get more volatile.",1315965566

2994572,comment,2993650,2994432,4,0,steve8918,,,"Previously the vast majority of investors were buy and hold, where they believed in companies and that their earnings would increase.  Of course, there were always traders like Jesse Livermore that traded off of order flow, but those were the minority.  Most were like Warren Buffett where buying and holding was for the best.<p>Now the majority of trades are done by algorithms with no biases at all towards the earnings growth of a company, be it HFT, or statistical arbitrage, or through other quantitative models.<p>HFT accounts for 75% of daily volume, and by definition, HFT does not take into consideration things like future earnings growth, etc.  For the most part, they simply find arbitrage opportunities and profit from them.<p>So stocks being bought and sold are not done based on the earnings potential of a company.  Case in point, Citigroup before the reverse split was trading hundreds of millions of shares per day, not because so many people believed in the company, but because it was dominated by rebate traders, HFT, day traders, etc.  I believe companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were trading millions of shares before they went pink slip, even though it was known that they were defunct.",1315965441

Traffic is growing on almost a daily basis and unique visitors, page views, etc. - while not massive - are promising.  I've been told that ad sales for sites with over 100K unique visitors per month are on another tier in terms of expected CPM and advertising credibility.<p>My question is:  let's say our site is pulling 25-50K unique visitors per month of a fairly specific audience (demographic-wise).  What would the HN audience recommend for our site to do, in order to maximize ad revenues?  We've tinkered with Google Ads and some other options but, as traffic picks up, we're beginning to look into it more seriously.  The difference between $0.25 CPM and $2.00 CPM is obviously huge, once traffic scales to a certain level.  Do all of the ad networks pay the same (roughly)?  Are all of the ad networks created equal or are there some we should reach out to that might be more selective, and therefore more rewarding?<p>Another related question (for those who have ad sales/buying experience): what should we project as an expected ""going rate"" CPM for a site with moderate traffic that reaches primarily college-educated males in the 25-50 age group?",1315965424

2994535,comment,2993844,2994194,2,0,chipsy,,,"I think the #1 reason why games don't need a lot of automated testing is serialization, or rather the common lack of it in most game worlds. If the data gets corrupt, you can reset the game and all is well again. When the rare corner cases pop up, it's easy to play whack-a-mole with them, because they're all ""shallow"" in the sense of the game starting from a clean reset frequently, so you can usually reproduce the bug quickly.<p>Of course, if the game does need heavy-duty serialization of everything, all bugs are potentially deadly. And this is largely the case for the line-of-business, social, and productivity apps, because that data is considered mission-critical. Corruption is not OK, reverting to backups is to be avoided. When a game has that kind of requirement, things get a lot tougher - and so games have naturally evolved to favor minimizing the save data to nothing or a few stats.<p>And this is borne out by looking for contrapositives. There are two genres that have a history of tending to be buggy because of some form of long-term data corruption: Large-scope RPGs and turn-based strategy games. It's hard to reach the bugs in those games, so it's also hard to fix them.",1315964712

As opposed to Asana, which has similar intentions, but is doing a private beta with larger companies only. Yes, Trello is much easier to get excited about.<p>EDIT<p>Some feedback: so far I really like it. It's intuitive. And it has some nice features out of the box that are lacking in other products such as assignment and voting. Assignment allows central authorities to exist, as well as hand-offs between people. Voting is awesome. I immediately see two uses for this: democratizing, and to allow collaborators to vote on what they <i>want</i> to do. The latter being something I've always personally wanted in a collaboration tool. Combining that with a central authority can be very powerful by allowing people to voice their interests, yet keep the project moving and avoid conflict.<p>As for the initial reaction: some of the views are pretty intimidating. Even thought there's <i>only</i> three lists at the start, it is still a little much to begin with. A lot to take in. If you ever implement a ""minimize list"" feature, that could easily reduce the noise for a beginner while still allowing you to explore all the features when you're ready to.<p>The edit screen has a lot happening in it too, but I think that's less of a problem since it's only visible when actually editing cards and you'll soon be using everything in there.<p>Also, I'm sure it's already in the works, but keyboard navigation will be huge for upcoming power users. Right now Vimium provides that for me, but it'd be great to have it built in.<p>It looks very useful! I'm already having fun with it and I'll try it out on an upcoming collaboration.

I'm moving pretty fast through all the refresher courses, and I'm amazed at what I've retained (and disappointed at what I've lost).<p>I've completed 113 out of 171 exercises in my off hours in the past couple weeks, and once I've gotten through them all, I'm going to run through MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus, 18.02 Multi-Variable Calculus, and 18.03 Differential Equations.<p>From there, I was planning on doing MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, so even though I don't think it would work out for me to jump in to a group like this without the proper background, I'll be following the progress of things closely.<p>In fact, the idea of HN being a platform for self-directed group education is a brilliant one.  While there are already websites focused on that, I know we're all impressed enough by the HN readership that there is an obvious advantage of organizing it here. Hopefully this experiment can work for other areas of study as well.",1315962477

2994415,comment,2992660,2994242,3,0,kiwidrew,,,"It's unlikely that the Delta fare from NYC to MSY and the American fare from MSY to LAX permit end-on-end combination with each other, so it would have to be issued as two separate tickets.  What happens if your Delta flight to New Orleans is delayed and you miss your connecting flight to Los Angeles on American?  Neither carrier is going to offer you any compensation, and your travel insurance probably has a clause which excludes misconnections caused by an airline's late arrival.<p>There are occasions when this strategy produces good results, however:  last year I needed a last-minute one way flight from a small southeastern city (TYS / Knoxville) to San Francisco, and the fares were extremely high ($800+).  But flights to Orlando were very cheap due to competition from low-cost leisure carriers, and the last-minute fares from Orlando (MCO) to San Francisco were quite reasonable.  I booked, on a single ticket and flying on a single airline the entire way, TYS-IAD-MCO-IAD-DEN-SFO.  This gave me a TYS-MCO fare plus an MCO-SFO fare, which was hundreds of dollars cheaper than the more direct TYS-DEN-SFO.  At the time, saving money was a lot more important than getting to San Francisco a couple of hours earlier.  A cunning plan that cannot fail!<p>Except that I missed my first flight of the morning due to an overnight road closure that blocked my only way of leaving the house.  By the time that I got to the airport, my originally booked flight had already left and I was faced with a very long wait for the next flight to IAD, which virtually guaranteed I wouldn't even make it to San Francisco that day.  It was only through a combination of charisma and blind luck that I managed to convince the airline to reroute me direct through Denver, which is completely against company policy.  They only charged me the $50 same-day standby fee.<p>Needless to say, I would never sell that sort of a ticket to the general public.  Far too many different ways in which things could go horribly wrong.  It's also likely that the airlines would promptly revoke your ticketing privileges with them were they to discover you were routinely issuing these sorts of tickets.",1315962320

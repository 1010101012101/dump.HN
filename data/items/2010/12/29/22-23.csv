Additionally, they tend to appreciate the value of networking and make an effort to meet new people.""<p>Nope! This is non-evidence. Successful people who are arrogant and antisocial are by nature less likely to run into you, so you should expect your observed pool of people-you-know to be heavily skewed towards the friendliest people.<p>A similar phenomenon occurs in social network rankings: For any given person with a reasonable number of Facebook friends, their friends will be, on average, more popular than the original person (popularity defined by number of friends).

That's why it's fraud. There is a strong incentive for one side (publisher) to take advantage of the other side (advertiser) and if allowed to exist on scale, would harm the whole marketplace.<p>The phrasing you used suggest fixed scheme.

Coffee with a CEO is better than nothing, and may potentially be useful down the road. (Can I have a job? Remember when we had coffee that one time?) Likewise, a date with a beautiful model, even one, is better than eating ramen alone. Well, usually. :)<p>Also, while I agree with what you said about having ""true value to offer"", there are many types of value. When developing a relationship with someone like a CEO, you may not be able to offer them direct monetary value, but you might be able to give technical insight, an outsider's point of view or a perspective from a different industry, or even just a like-minded person to talk about basketball with.<p>My advice is to look hard for the value you can offer.

2050455,comment,2049105,2049105,0,0,rebooter,,,"I've had my run-in with Google AdSense in the past.  My prediction:  If they don't change their ways this is headed to a huge class-action lawsuit and nothing but bad press.<p>My experience was interesting and revealing.  I had a bunch of domains (about 200) parked with GoDaddy in something called ""cash parking"".  Not a money maker, but, what the heck.  Once I realized that this was actually a service provided by Google I decided to look into cutting-out the middle man.<p>I looked into AdSense and found AdSense for Domains.  Exactly the same service being offered by GoDaddy.  I took all 200-some domains off GoDaddy, created an AdSense account and parked all of them with Google.  They approved every single domain name and put ads on them.  Great.<p>Two days later I get this email about fraudulent activity and the termination of my AdSense account.  I appealed.  No love.  So, the termination was, effectively, forever.<p>Here's the irony of this story.  The same 200 domains had been parked with GoDaddy for months without any issues.  Serviced by Google.  They even made a few bucks for all involved.  The domains were not advertised in any way anywhere.  I just parked them and went on with my business.  This means that Google was responsible for sending traffic to these sites, every bit of it.  About 50 of the domains were political in nature.  Being that this was around election time my guess is that they got more traffic than usual, and, I guess, hits.  I'll never know because the account was killed within two days of being formed with no data provided whatsoever.<p>So:  Google sends traffic to the sites.  The sites get clicks.  They close my AdSense account.  No appeal, no recourse, no human being to speak to.  Bullshit!<p>Google needs to get sued in a major way to ""reset"" some of their behaviors.  Why?  Because they are a de-facto monopoly.  Search is dominated by them.  Video (YouTube) is dominated by them. Advertising (AdWords and AdSense) is dominated by them.<p>They do not provide for any intelligent way to deal with problems.  They will tell you that you've done something wrong but will NOT provide proof, details nor an opportunity to rectify the problem.  A likely scenario is that of someone just getting started who makes a few mistakes and needs to learn.  Google does not provide for any of the above.  They are judge, jury and executioner and a pretty mean one at that.<p>This fellow with the boat site probably deserved a slap on the hand for his site.  He did no deserve to loose ALL OF HIS INCOME.  They could have easily said something like:<p>""Your site-based per-click revenue is now 10% of normal during a probation period.  These are the things you did wrong: link.  Here's where you can see the activity and what happened: link.  Here are the rules you need to pay attention to: link.  The account will be monitored and your earnings percentage slowly increased as we see that these violations are rectified.  We look forward to a continued relationship with <company name>"".<p>...A far better approach.<p>If you are going to shut down someones entire revenue stream you need to have a humane and reasonable process to review the situation and seek resolution rather than hitting someone over the head with a sledge-hammer.<p>I don't know what will trigger this lawsuit.  I do think that it is almost inevitable.  They might even need to be broken into different verticals in order to make it all fair.  I think they are playing a dangerous game.  I think they are playing with fire.<p>The Google ""do no evil"" thing may have been a nice idea.  However, as it pertains to AdWords/AdSense they are headed straight for evil-land if they keep on this path.<p>There's another topic: Google censorship.  I think that, because they are a monopoly, they don't have the right to censor.  They can't be in charge of what is and isn't appropriate on the web.  Different issue.",1293662565

To me, your use of mundane suggests the task of writing a program after high-level questions, what and why, have received high-level answers.  Everything but initial brainstorming.<p>The hypothesis introduced in the article is that pair programming is beneficial because it improves individual skills and code quality.  I'm not sure how clearly that's communicated.<p>Individual skills are improved by understanding your current problem-solving process and upgrading it as necessary.  This isn't only about picking up skills by observing others, but reasoning about the steps you take and updating as appropriate.  Pair programming isn't necessary for this, it just facilitates it.  This whole being mindful thing deserves a post of its own.<p>I would expect that code quality would be improved because design flaws and bugs are more likely to be caught early.  Therefore there's less time spent rewriting or debugging.<p>I'm treating this foray into pair programming as an experiment.  It was literally a week ago that I began to see how pair programming could be efficient and even enjoyable.  I do not plan on doing 100% pairing forever, it's impractical and probably inefficient.

By combining multi-level execution trees and columnar data layout, it is capable of running aggregation queries over trillion-row tables in seconds. The system scales to thousands of CPUs and petabytes of data, and has thousands of users at Google. In this paper, we describe the architecture and implementation of Dremel, and explain how it complements MapReduce-based computing. We present a novel columnar storage representation for nested records and discuss experiments on few-thousand node instances of the system.<p>Overview by Greg Linden:\n<a href=""http://glinden.blogspot.com/2010/12/papers-on-specialized-databases-at.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glinden.blogspot.com/2010/12/papers-on-specialized-da...</a>",1293661080

Vigorous biking means going all out for 12 full minutes likely with the resistance turned up pretty high.  When it comes to elliptical machines they are notoriously bad at making people think they do all this 'work' when in reality it's momentum unless they turn the machines resistance way up.  Treadmills do some of this by 'carrying' people along, but they are not nearly as bad as ellipticals.<p>Boxing is very good, but really doing boxing for 10 minutes with a heavy bag is not easy.

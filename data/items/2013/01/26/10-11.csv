That is true. But as far as i am concern and many other video encoder it is also true that it hasn't match x264 yet.<p>2. VP9 is great! It has matched and in many case even exceed x264 quality. Although there would still be areas where x264 perform better simply because it is much more mature.<p>3. So given more time VP9 will very likely beat x264 quality. It is only with 10% range of HEVC / h.265 JM, under benchmarks. So it will very likely beat that too.<p>4. Do bare in mind JM is reference encoder. So it does not in anyway show the full potential of h.265 as a codec. While VP9 is itself the standard and the best encoder available. If you look at the difference between h.264 JM and x264. I will argue it is very likely x265 ( If DS decide to do it ) will still be better then VP9.<p>5. Daala... as much as i love Mozilla, knowing their pace of work and Daala's current condition, expect it to compete with h.266 or VP10.<p>6. Patents are not evil. Patents Trolls are.",1359197456

It unifies your interaction with Apple related HW and services to a single identity. Does it anger you that Apple forces you to sign into your AppStore account to use iCloud when they could be separate? Facebook is used by many sites as a signon credential (which is what I mostly use it for).<p>For the most part, all of this talk about Google ""forcing"" you to use G+ to access their other services is really about promoting a single signon, centralized account profile, instead of having different accounts on different properties. This yields a consistent user interface, and centralized location for you to view what information Google knows about you for all their services, and how to delete or export it.  You can choose to not ""sign in"" on some of the properties, for example, legacy YouTube logins still work, but honestly, is it really better for the user if you had a different account for YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Drive, etc and had to log into all of them separately? For example, having Google Wallet linked to your profile lets you buy something on YouTube, in Google Play, or elsewhere, without fumbling with a credit card.<p>Unlike some of Facebook's services/apps, Google does not automatically share your activity on some news feed every time you do something on their sites, you have to specifically choose to share it. Indeed, it appears G+ doesn't want to pollute the feed with lots of autopublished stuff which interferes with S/N search quality, which is one reason theorized as to why no ""write"" API exists yet.<p>G+ is plus.google.com, if you are on other properties signed in, then the biggest benefit is having the Share button be able to pull your contacts, combined with a single place to manage your settings for everything.<p>In many cases you have a choice. You can use Chrome without signin. You have incognito windows. YouTube doesn't require signin unless the video is NSFW, etc.<p>I for one, appreciate the ""G+ as a common layer across Google Websites"" for the purposes of unified profile/single-signon. The plus.google.com newsfeed service is just one addition service you can either choose to use or not. It's best not to think of G+ as a social network + activity stream like Facebook.",1359196993

You are actively using a major feature of the product, namely Hangouts. You may not be using it in the way that Google intended it (business vs. personal use), but you are indeed using it.<p><i>> I'm actually kind of annoyed every time I have to log onto Google+ to do something because I know they are about to add me to some press release statistic.

I think you would be hard pressed to find a publicly traded company that <i>doesn't</i> report their number of active users--in press releases, too, no less.<p>I think what you're trying to say is that you feel that Google+ Hangouts are not a true part of Google+? Because this feature does not specifically need to belong to Google+? (Correct me if I have misjudged your opinion.) Well, sure, it doesn't have to, but Google wants it there, and it makes sense from a social perspective.<p>You may be using a subset of Google+ features, but that still makes you a user--just like if you only used Skype or Facebook for the video chat feature, you would still be a user.",1359195560

It is like you are learning programming for the first time. Initially, they seem weird. Haskell requires patience. It is not a language where you can jump in and immediately see results, like jumping from C to Python. Someone who starts learning vi might be frustrated too. You need to learn ten keys before it becomes as productive as notepad.<p>> In Ruby or a similar object oriented language you expect to find three APIs/gems, all with a similar object oriented syntax, but for three Haskell DSLs designed for three different tasks to share syntax implies that their authors failed to optimise them for those tasks, hence instead of five minutes with API documentation you have hours of DSL tutorials ahead of you before you can begin work.<p>You need to learn monads only once. I can use new monads without any trouble.",1333976398

3816719,comment,3814347,3814347,3,0,cooperadymas,,,"Most Python CMSs are built on Django. They rely on the Django admin for their admin interface. The Django admin is not as intuitive or easy to use as WordPress's admin, even with the customization that some of these tools make. It is great for its intended purpose, but for running a typical blog it isn't as good.<p>There are no inherent configurable site settings in Django without getting into the code. You can't set the blog tagline, or change a simple setting like ""Users must be registered and logged in to comment"" from the admin.<p>Django's templating system does not lend itself toward drop-in themes like WordPress (this is huge). Since Django, and most Python frameworks, rely on reusable apps it's a lot more difficult to create a theme that you can simply load into a directory and use.<p>I don't think I have seen a Python CMS/blog engine yet that uses widgets. It's almost trivial for a Django programmer to create a sidebar ""widget"" that shows the most recent 5 posts, but for a casual blogger this is something they can't do.<p>A WordPress site owner will almost never have to think about the database powering the site. This is another thing WP actually does a good job with.

Every other platform (i.e. .NET/java/ruby/python) have gobs of built-in functionality in the standard library - everything from parsing, to different I/O models (NIO in java), to frameworks (WSGI, WS consumption and production, etc).  Lisps diverge fundamentally (e.g., the threading model) if it isn't specified in CLtL or ANSI CL.  CL seem hamstrung by those documents.<p>Concrete Example:\n7 years ago I couldn't (using available libraries) reliably parse in lisp a DB dump in XML (~8GB), select some records based on a set of calculations, and convert it to CSV.  Most libraries insisted on needing the whole document in memory, some libraries leaked like a sieve and caused heap exhaustion, others couldn't handle UTF8.  In the end, I could do it python (couple hours to develop and took 45-60 minutes to run), I could do it in java (several hours to develop and ran in ~8min), but I couldn't do it in LISP without writing a custom XML parser or delving into FFI.

3816708,comment,3815854,3816201,22,0,rdtsc,,,"> The good point hidden in the article is that American culture has no real idea of ""friendship"" in a sense that people from other cultures either now or historically would recognize as such. American's just don't have friends. We have weak acquaintencnes. Why? Nobody seems to know. But it's something that probably deserves more attention.<p>I think that is a very interesting point. I have mentioned that as well in the past a couple of times. There was a difference in how friendships worked in my old country (in Eastern Europe) and how they work here. Here ""friendships"" are just acquaintances as you said. People gather lots of acquaintances but no or few good friends.<p>I'll propose a couple of reasons:<p>* People are more mobile. They move more so they don't have time to really make friends. This starts in childhood when kids move with the parents from school district to school district from neighborhood to neighborhood. There is a non-negligible network effect here and that is even if you don't move and live on one street and go to one school, chances are your friend's family will.<p>* Education system. At some point kids stop being in one class and are allowed to pick individual classes and schedules. So they stop seeing or spending time with the same classmates. There is extracurricular activities of course but it is not the same as starting with 1st grade and potentially being with the same group of people until the 12th grade.<p>* More individualism. Being a friend means sharing more and means relying on other more. In other words it means asking for help and offering help. This means ""being in other people's business"" which is a no-no in U.S. But the other side of being too individualistic means never really opening up to a friend. And at the end of the day one can only get so close talking about the weather, after some time it gets boring. So there is the wall that people don't let others through.<p>* Affluence. I think in countries where it is harder to survive on your own. People will stick together better for support. They have to have a support group to survive. In richer countries people can get by easier living alone and being more independent.<p>* It is not as much countries as times. In other words in the past, people used to have fewer but closer friends anywhere in the world. And, say, in the last 30 years people started to become more isolated. Could be technology, or globalization (people have to move because of jobs).<p>* It is not the world it is you. You just got older, more paranoid, and more withdrawn. The perception is that there just aren't that many friendly people around. But maybe other people just don't want to be friends with ""you"" in particular. They are still people with very good close friends but because you don't have them now, it seems like nobody does.",1333975318

It's one thing to say ""Haskell takes a long time to become useful for the average person"" and another to say ""Haskell is useless for hacking (as in quick prototyping as I understand from your article)"".<p>I, for one, can produce quick mock-ups and prototypes way faster in Haskell than in any other language I know; and I consider myself an advanced user of Ruby and Python. You need to, of course, absorb and internalize a large number of use cases and concepts in Haskell before you get to this point, but it is quite extraordinary once you're there. High expressiveness, modeling to fit the domain even for small, one-off tasks (thanks to algebraic data types) and many other elegant aspects all become second nature and really really fast once you're expert enough.<p>dons' slides come to mind as a presentation on a related topic if anyone's interested[1].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://donsbot.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/semicolon.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donsbot.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/semicolon.pdf</a>",1333974829
3816680,comment,3815854,3815854,9,0,jonnathanson,,,"A lot of it has to do with socialization. I was socialized with a pretty broadly mixed-sex peer group as a young child. I had friends who were boys, and friends who were girls, though admittedly a lot more of the former than the latter. I attended elementary school (and high school, and college, and now the workplace) with a roughly equal number of young men and women. And today, I can count on almost as many female friends as male friends. I can assure you that there's little to no underlying sexual tension in 99% of those friendships.<p>All of this would have been unthinkable in my grandfather's day. As the article points out, previous generations had far stricter boundaries on the man's place in society, and the woman's. Young men rarely socialized with young women until the teenage years, which coincided precisely with the most raging period of hormonal upswing, and the result was a potent cocktail of mystery and awkwardness surrounding the opposite sex. Then they went off into separate workplaces, or at best, mixed workplaces with very strict boundaries of separation. Quite simply, they were never given the <i>chance</i> to develop normative standards of mixed-sex friendship.<p>The premise that men and women are ineluctibly attracted to one another, and thus, a male friend and a female friend secretly want to fuck, is a broad generalization hammered on top of a specific, interpersonal dynamic. It doesn't hold up, except in those very rare cases where it does. ""When Harry Met Sally"" inverts the rule and the exception, taking a specific case -- <i>this particular guy</i> and <i>this particular woman</i> want to bang -- and applying it more universally. We encounter the same problem when trying to apply Ross and Rachel archetypes. Ross and Rachel are secretly attracted to one another <i>because the writers of the show created them that way</i>. It's not ""inevitable"" that any given Ross and any given Rachel are destined to pine for one another. (Likewise, nobody ever takes note of the fact that Ross and Phoebe were friends, and no sexual tension existed there. In a parallel universe, it's entirely possible that the creators of ""Friends"" never made anybody attracted to anyone else on the show, although I suspect that version of the show is a lot more boring). Art can imitate life, and life can imitate art, but we should be very careful to note the differences between the two.",1333974824

For this, I recommend using an editor that can easily display the column number that the cursor is in.<p>Most of the author's other comments I can understand, even if I don't share his opinions. There is certainly a cognitive barrier to entry inherent in a lot of the language's concepts. All I can say about this is that as I've used the language more and more, these barriers seem to have melted away to the point where, simply by browsing the types of names exported by a library module, I can pretty much intuit how it works. A lot of libraries are very well-documented, and some are definitely not, but even in the latter case, the type signatures alone can go a long way to helping me understand.<p>I'd probably be a Scheme addict myself if Haskell hadn't convinced me of the indispensable power of strong static types. I love how elegantly simple Scheme is, and how you can construct so much from such humble beginnings. It feels like it distills functional programming down to its very essence. SICP is a beautiful thing as well. But Haskell naturally guides me to writing better, more robust, more correct code in ways that dynamic languages simply aren't capable of, and I just find myself getting frustrated when using other languages because I always end up wasting time fixing bugs that I know GHC would have caught for me up front.<p>Someone in the Haskell community (I can't recall who it was) has said: ""I think of types as warping our gravity, so that the direction we need to travel to write correct programs becomes 'downhill'."" I couldn't agree more.<p>Edit: I also have to state my disagreement about monads being a ""wobbly crutch"". While it is true that they are more or less necessary in order to introduce practical impurity into Haskell, being necessary doesn't make them a shim or a hack. Not only are they an elegant solution to many problems, but they are really quite simple to use. If people spent as much time actually writing monadic code as they do reading the zillions of silly, confusing monad tutorials, they'd quickly reach the point where they no longer see what the big fuss is about. There is nothing truly scary here; the worst part about monads is the name.",1333973678

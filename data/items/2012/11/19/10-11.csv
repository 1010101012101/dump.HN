Racism and sexism were systematic and endemic in the UK during much of the 20th century.<p>You say that ""political correctness had taken hold in local government by the early 1980s"", but you don't mention that the <i>reason</i> for this was that during the early 1980s there were numerous serious race riots throughout the UK.<p>Hate speech and anti-discrimination laws have drastically improved the lives of millions of people in the UK. I don't pretend that discrimination has been eliminated, but you simply can't deny the fact that British society today is considerably less racist and sexist than it was thirty years ago.<p>Now, there is a side effect to this. Because the UK doesn't have explicit free speech protection mistakes have been made enforcing those laws. Sometimes people mis-interpret them, in the same way people mis-understand health and safety laws. But I would argue these costs are far out-weighed by the benefit that a ethnically diverse and accepting society has brought. I see that since I started typing this someone has already replied to you saying how much their life has improved due to these laws.<p>Getting back to your original point: I don't think this is a UK specific problem. I could probably cherry-pick similar examples from the US and other EU countries and come up with equally compelling arguments that ""this shambles could only happen in [X]"".<p>This is obviously a very emotional topic for many people.

Lots of people like this definition because it's a nice, simple and objective defintion and it means black people in the UK can be racist to white people, or that affirmative action is racist. I think this is the definition you're using.<p>There's another definition, which is that racist actions are actions that's designed to maintain & reinforce the institutionalised power structure among races. Right now, if modern UK life was a video game, ""white male"" would be an easier difficulty level than ""black male"". There are statistically less problems for the ""white male"" group. Racist actions is talk that re-enforced that imbalance, and attempts to undo the power imbalance is not racist. This definition is harder for some people to accept because it means that you need to look at yourself and think about what power imbalances you might be benefiting from, and it means that affirmative action is not racist, and attempts to stop is could be construed as racist (since stopping affirmative action can re-enforce power imbalances).

As parts get smaller, markings are less common, and if you have a few parts spill out and mix, testing them may be the only way to figure out what is what.<p>Resistors >= 1206 have identifying resistance markers. Most resistors on boards are smaller, 0806, 0402, 0201, and do not have markings. You would have to manually test the resistors to see what their values are. They don't have power ratings anywhere, only resistance ratings.<p>Capacitors don't have markings. Transistors don't have markings, and about the only thing you could do would be to test the pin configuration and check if it's an NPN or a PNP.<p>ICs generally do have markings, unless they are smaller and have either an impossible to read laser inscription (even under a microscope, you have to have the light hit it just right to read what the part is) or no markings at all. ICs are also the big ticket items on a board, and it's almost impossible to get a 32 pin IC off with a soldering iron. If I could splash some water on and grab it, that would be cool.<p>If you made all your own boards, knew the parts that went onto them, thought it was worth the ~80 cents of resistors, capacitors, transistors, and selectively removed components, you could be in for a treat.<p>But, this is still awesome. As a hobbyist, I would rather just buy some new components so I have them all in a strip in a bag that has the part numbers, and the values. As a recycler though, this is amazing. Instead of having to reflow everything and liberate all the parts, I can grab all the ICs and transistors, melt them down and regain the metals used.<p>It might not be worth it to do it yet, but saving hundreds of circuit boards would take up a bit of space. The board itself is likely >90% of the space. I want the 10% that has the parts on it. I can stash these for later when a more economical way of getting the metals out comes around.",1353320412

You can forget about talking to another passenger, even a friend. Even looking happy while not obviously reading something that might be funny is met with embarrassed glances at feet at ceilings.<p>In the evening though, after about 9 or 10, the tube is full of groups on their ways home from the pubs - then there are people singing, often whole carriages will silently giggle at someone being an extrovert centre of attention.<p>Finally, there is the etiquette surrounding when one must offer a seat to someone else. the order of priority appears to be:<p><pre><code>    * pregnant and (obviously) disabled people, plus new mothers.\n    * old people (ladies first)\n    * children (especially medium sized ones who look like they might actually sit \n      down, and/or shut up if given a seat)\n    * the rest of us, in a reserved, passive aggressive scrum.\n</code></pre>\n(also, obviously, talking to a complete stranger on the tube is a massive faux pas, no matter the time of day...)<p>On quiet coaches specifically, I have to say that on British ""mainline"" trains there is a big problem, which is reservations. For example, on virgin trains there is always a quiet coach (both a standard and first class one), and a coach with no reserved seats. If you want a seat at a busy time of day, you must be one of the first to arrive at (on Virgin it's coach E) and take one (it is even possible to get the prized window-side-facing-forwards-at-a-table seats this way.) However, these coaches never coincide. Thus, if you want to be in the quiet coach you must book a seat in advance, which is cheaper but restricts you to a particular train - if you're late you must pay twice, and if you're early you have to wait. This is important when you're on the tube (which frequently has delays) and the trains from Euston to Manchester are every 20 minutes (and absolutely packed in the evenings, especially Fridays, in spite of this.) Given the convenience factor, I usually plump for coach E, and risk the screaming babies/mobile chatterers - as another commenter pointed out, this is why I paid 80 for a pair of headphones.",1353320309

First of all, it's a bit of a bother to run; for one, it's not integrated with the IDE. So for bugs in simple areas of the code, I just don't bother and use the integrated debugger.<p>Then, the really hard problems (for me) usually involve a concurrency bug that manifests itself after a while. When ODB runs out of memory, it will discard the earlier part of the recording (it uses a circular buffer), and so I've found that some vital information is lost.<p>So I've found that ODB is great for complex algorithm bugs that are easy to reproduce in a controlled fashion.

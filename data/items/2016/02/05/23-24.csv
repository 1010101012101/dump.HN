Useful as a 2nd factor for authentication and a little less friction (more convenient, less secure).  I&#x27;ve yet to see any technology that can replace an old fashioned master password as the 1st factor.  All the hype around biometrics a few years ago seemed especially silly given that it&#x27;s pretty easy to steal fingerprints and once stolen, of course, they are pretty hard to change.  Maybe I&#x27;m an outlier here but I think in 20 years we&#x27;ll still be using password managers with master password type in authentication into a dashboard with varying degrees of additional authentication required to access sites/services within, based on relative sensitivity.",1454716363

Similar analysis applies to Dash, which I believe uses some (no doubt &quot;improved&quot;) version of CoinJoin. :<p>All anonymity is not created equal: you&#x27;re better off if we can only figure out that one out of 6 billion people bought a Nickelback album, then if we know it was either you or one guy in Tristan da Cunha. The size of your anonymity set matters and Cryptonote provides a rather small one in comparison to Zerocash. This is not to say Cryptonote is worthless, there are tradeoffs between the two, but Zerocash has a distinct advantage in terms of anonymity and I think it matters.<p>Cryptonote&#x27;s ring signatures scale linearly in the number of people your transactions are mixed with. As a result, you can&#x27;t mix an individual transaction with that many people without it getting too big and too computationally costly(chaining transactions doesn&#x27;t solve this). In contrast, Zerocash mixes every transaction with every other transaction ever[1].<p>If you are worried about maintaining privacy given repeated interactions with merchants or others who already have some partial information about you, the size of the anonymity set matters considerably. Longterm intersectional attacks are a major problem with anonymity systems. The smaller the set you mix with on any given transaction, the easier it is for some third party to use outside information to eliminate everyone else in the mixing set (e.g because she knows no one else in the set was online at the time of the transaction or was in your approximate geographic area), and determine the true spender. One of the few effective defenses we have for this is to simply include as many people as possible in the anonymity set. If you want to avoid companies building financial profiles of users from the blockchain, this is precisely the type of attack you need to thwart.<p>[1] Technically, up to 2^64 transactions and the networks ability to handle the spent serial number list.

The information listed varies, and you may not be able to get any information from some sites.<p>In some cases, you may be able to use the finger command to verify an address or find more information for someone at another institution about whom you already have some information. The finger command is available on most Unix systems. It differs from the whois command, which you can use simply to find the email address of someone at another institution.<p>To use finger, at your Unix prompt, enter:<p><pre><code>    finger username@node.domain\n</code></pre>\nReplace node.domain with the appropriate machine and domain address, and username with the name of the person or the person&#x27;s username, for example:<p><pre><code>    finger dvader@mentor.cc.purdue.edu\n</code></pre>\nSee: <a href=""https://kb.iu.edu/d/aasp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kb.iu.edu/d/aasp</a>",1454716342

Our rent was $2800.<p>In the rental market a big driver of the landlord decision cycle is needing, at a minimum, to have a reputable tenant and to cover the cost of carry of the asset (mortgage, etc). In many cases if their cost of carry is met (and that&#x27;s often a low bar....many landlords in both NYC and SF own their apartments outright, or are paying tiny monthlies on a refinanced mortgage that was originated in the 90&#x27;s), then the priority is getting a reputable tenant who won&#x27;t destroy the place or create drama.<p>If the above paragraph is confusing, basically what I am trying to say is that a landlord often prefers, for example, $3000/month from a tenant who they think is 98% likely to be an &quot;easy tenant&quot; to $3500/month from one who they think is 80% likely to be the same. In other words, there&#x27;s a market premium on reliable tenants, especially in places like SF that have aggressive tenant-protection laws which make landlords even more antsy.<p>As layoffs start happening (as they did in the nine months before we signed our lease back in &#x27;09) landlords of reliably-paying, drama-free tenants start getting antsy about keeping their current tenant or finding a suitable replacement.<p>As such, what drives prices in markets like NY/SF isn&#x27;t just supply-demand equilibrium; there&#x27;s also a significant behavioral economics angle aspect to it as well, as landlords are willing to pay a premium for peace of mind.<p>Therefore, I would expect a significant drop in SF rents if layoffs start coming.",1454715804

The fear was that they would use that private conversation as a reason to imprison, torture, and/or execute you.  You had to watch every word you say for fear of detention or death.<p>Many Americans do not believe that their government would or could use that information against them, especially since they are not terrorists (think of the old cop line &quot;if you are innocent you have nothing to hide).  The fact is that much of the information that is being collected by the government is ALREADY being collected by Google, Facebook, Yahoo and AT&T.  Most Americans rightfully assume that google is keeping track of their searches, and that AT&T has records of who they call.  Why would they trust some corporation with this data, but not their government?

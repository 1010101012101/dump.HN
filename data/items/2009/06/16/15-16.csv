Right now I save a list of strings I have checked, because it is quicker to see if a string in in that small list than in the dictionary, then once I find a word I clear the list of strings I have checked.  Is there any thing else like this I could do to speed things up so I am not constantly checking if the same strings are a word?  Should I not be clearing that list so often?",1245167875

So much is being force fed to them that they've started to just take it sight unseen.  Let me take the three examples the author gives…<p>* 3 million people protested in Tehran: I was just pointing this out to someone.  If you truly had 3 million people and they stood in the road you'd have 5 people across.  Take those 5 rows and have everyone line up behind them.  In that case 3 million people would go on for roughly 114 miles (assuming about a ft of depth per person).  It would be visible from space.<p>More important, a few thousand Iranian police wouldn't stand a chance against a group 3 million strong.  They could overthrow the capital with that many people.<p>* Mousavi under house arrest: Possible but pretty stupid.  This is the most plausible of the ones listed but it would be suicide for the ruling party to do so it stands to logic they wouldn't.<p>* the president of the election monitoring committee declared the election invalid on Saturday: If you've watched the news for any amount of time you know the election committee can't invalidate an election the Ayatollah has approved of.<p>So under basic scrutiny all these claims seem unlikely.

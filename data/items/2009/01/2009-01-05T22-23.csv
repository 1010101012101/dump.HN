Nothing in, nothing out.  The college dining hall was open 7 days/week, so I always ate there instead of eating out or cooking.  (The only times I ate out were the TYPO - ""Take Your Professor Out"" - dinners, which the school paid for.)  Room & board was completely paid for, and we weren't allowed to live off-campus.  Internet access was provided by the college, as was webhosting.  Student activities (I did sailing, orchestra, taiko, some artsy-crafty stuff, and a variety of other things that would've otherwise been expensive) all came out of the student activities fund, which was paid with our tuition.  I bought books once a semester with a credit card that went to my parent's account.  After the first year, I didn't bother signing up for a room phone, instead using my cell phone, again paid for by my parents.  The only thing I ended up paying for was ordering Wingz or pizza at midnight, or alcohol contributions to parties.<p>There were many purchases that I could easily have afforded that I didn't bother with, because it meant I would've had to worry about money.  They included Starbucks, going out for meals or ice cream, paid LiveJournal accounts, actually buying music, and basically anything that required a credit card (I didn't have my own until I got a job after college).  If GitHub had existed back then and charged, I would've said ""Screw it, I'll setup my own git account on a college server, and we can all pull from that.""<p>The cost isn't just $7-12/month.

I'd love to run a private lab with him, but we need some measure of success first for us to fund it ourselves. Send me an email, we (mostly Josh) have a lot of ideas that could positively impact the world, either through improving lives, making energy less scarce, or one specific idea that involves commodifying ""kits"" to help perform a specific type of cutting edge medical research.<p>See his HIV curing idea midway through this post. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47751"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47751</a><p>If you're looking for a business model for a Y Combinator for biotech, here's my suggestion. In biotech, patents are king. There are almost no startups in biotech that don't have patents. Institutional investors will not consider startups without patents. While it's possible to write a patent without the help of a lawyer, you drastically increase the probability of getting a patent when you have a lawyer.<p>So you could provide people with the resources to help obtain a patent in exchange for a percentage of royalties and equity in the company that owns the patent.",1190275053

Most people will still downvote / leftvote things they don't agree with and upvote / rightvote things they do agree with.  If the desire to silence a dissenting opinion could be controlled by the majority of people, free speech would not be such a rare thing, let alone need to be written into law.",1190274631

57298,story,,,57,94,Shooter,"Are you going to change the world?  (Really?)",,"[With apologies for my long-windedness]<p>This question was inspired by the post regarding the CMU Professor (Pausch) that is dying of cancer and is facing death with an amazingly positive attitude.<p>Specifically, there was a thread started by jaed:<p>""It's sad that we have to be reminded of it, but this just reaffirms that the little bubble world of YC, TechCrunch, and Web 2.Oh really don't mean a whole lot in the grand scheme of life. This guy wouldn't trade some extra time with his family for all the startups and VC cash in the world. It just puts things into perspective.""<p>I agree with jaed.  I also agree with neilc, who thinks that the ""YC philosophy"" is consistent with the positive message of the article.<p>SO MY QUESTION IS THIS:  Is making an AJAXified tool or toy that will likely be used by less than 1% of the people in the richest country in the world the absolute best use of your time and talents right now?  Honestly?<p>This is not a rhetorical question, nor is it intended to cast judgment on anyone who is actively pursuing a startup just to make money.  I can't throw stones, because that is exactly what I've spend MY life doing.  I also don't want to make anyone feel bad, I'm just trying to prompt a discussion.  <p>I'm wondering if people think that our best and brightest minds might be better suited to doing something like medical research than, say, designing software and working for hedge funds?  There is really nothing like finding out someone you love has cancer or a life-threatening illness to make you feel completely impotent when you're just a businessman or programmer.  I've helped design medical software in the past, but it was never a great leap forward or anything.  It was just incremental progress for money.  I've never felt like I made a GREAT difference.  And sitting in a children's hospital is a VERY humbling experience, no matter how successful you are.<p> \nI'm an entrepreneur and an investor, and I enjoy it.  I'm not unfulfilled, but I have a growing regret that I haven't done much to really help the world.  I donate to charities, and I've founded companies that have made really good products and offered great services, but I've never made the type of contribution that saves lives.  I've never discovered a vaccine or an improved diagnostic tool or anything.  And I'd like to.  I feel like I've won the luck lottery (white, male, mostly healthy, born in the USA, educated, wealthy) and I want to give back more. I haven't faced the obstacles that some people face (racism, limited access to education,etc.), so I guess I have a guilt complex or something that I haven't done more.  Typical liberal ;-)<p>\n//////////////////////////////////////////<p>I've thought of going back to medical school or something, but my odds of really helping there are small and it wastes my natural skill set.  (I'm also not likely to be accepted, but that's another story.)  I believe in entrepreneurship though, so I can try to make a difference in that way.  <p>So, if anyone here has any ideas to save lives or make a massive improvement in the world, give me a shout.  Seriously.  I have more money than Paul Graham (although I'm not as smart, connected, or good looking) and I'm open to ideas outside the Y Combinator sweet spot.  I think the best ideas in most industries come from people OUTSIDE that industry, so I would think that the brainpower on this site could really make a difference in the world.  I don't think YC are that interested in medical startups (etc.), so I don't think I'm stepping on their toes...but, if I am, please let me know and I'll retract this portion of the post.",1190274584

57296,comment,56957,56957,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I don't like downvoting because downvotes are so ambiguous in meaning. An upvote clearly means ""read this!"". A downvote could mean disagreement on the subject, dislike of the author or just disinterest. I might want to read a story with wich many people disagree, but I might not want to read one that everybody finds completely irrelevant or shallow.<p>The trouble is that the meanings of up and downvotes are different for news stories and comments respectively. For a comment, the votes almost exclusively mean agreement/disagreement. Only in rare cases do I disagree with a comment but still find it so important that I vote it up. This is different from, say, a scientific paper where this happens frequently.<p>Overall I think downvotes are unnecessary and cause a lot of bad blood.",1190274260

57294,comment,56957,57045,0,0,oditogre,,,"I disagree, as noted further up the thread.  Preventing downvotes doesn't remove the dissenting opinion.  In fact, it allows and encourages it.  Downvotes allow groupthink to silence disagreement.  If you disagree with something, instead of downvoting, post a comment explaining your position.",1190274060

If you don't like a person's viewpoints, you can't shut them down by downvoting them; you can only upvote the viewpoint you do like, and / or present your own position yourself, if no one else has done it.",1190273647

57285,comment,57195,57195,0,0,Shooter,,,"This guy is very inspiring.  Such a great attitude!<p>I recently found a red mole on my wife's skin.  It was just a fluke that I noticed it.  I once designed pattern recognition software to help recognize skin cancer, so I knew what to watch out for.  Anyway, she had it biopsied and it came back as malignant melanoma - the worst form of skin cancer.  She had surgery to remove it and several of her lymph nodes two days after the diagnosis.  She is cancer free now (PET scan), but it was quite a scare.  She is young and had never had much sun exposure, so we were initially surprised with the diagnosis.  It turns out that some skin cancers are predominantly genetic. And skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, especially among young people.<p>//PSA Portion of post//<p>Check your skin monthly to see if you have any unusual changes.  As with most cancers, early detection is the key to higher survival rates.  If you notice something unusual, go to a DERMATOLOGIST (not a GP.)  Dermatologists have much better detection rates than regular docs.  My wife had a GP and a surgeon tell her the red mole was nothing, and she only had it removed because I kept nagging her.  Dermatologists measure size/penetration etc. with skin cancer to determine survival rates.  My wife's survival rate was 85%, but .02mm deeper and it would have dropped significantly.  My doctor had a patient with the same type of melanoma, for example, and she died within three weeks of noticing a new mole.  She took a ""wait and see"" approach and it killed her.  So don't wait!<p>A mnemonic for things to watch out for: ABCDE.<p>A=Asymmetry (Uneven Surface);\nB=Borders (Irregular mole borders);\nC=Color (Varied colors are bad.  Reds and blacks are bad);\nD=Diameter (Larger than your pupil/a pencil eraser = bad);\nE=Evolving (Any changes, such as bleeding, crusting, etc.)<p>//End PSA//<p>Wow.

57284,comment,57140,57140,0,0,vegashacker,,,"Perhaps some of the hesitation is due to the fact that FB is seeking ""proposals for building a business on Facebook Platform"".  I think a lot of people are considering making a FB app to augment their main offering, but most probably aren't building a whole business on the platform.  My interpretation of the common blogosphere opinion seemed to be that focusing only on Facebook was too risky given that you could be screwed over by the whim of the growing giant.\n",1190271838

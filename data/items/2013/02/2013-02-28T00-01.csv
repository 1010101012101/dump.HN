I feel like this is gradually happening, I know in the US and Japan but probably other developed countries as well. Women predictably are irritated by this trend and you often hear them complaining nastily that men need to do things like ""get off the computer"", ""put down the video games"", and ""step up their games"" (dating wise).",1362013084

And what do they intend to do with the engineers they have right now?<p>They haven't come up with an answer to the first question so far as I can tell, which is a bigger problem than anything else.<p>For the second question they are faced with a lot of problems. If they want to try to retain as much talent as possible they're going about it the wrong way. If they want to instill discipline and transition down to a smaller more mediocre more ""enterprisey"" company that pumps out crappy line-of-business apps then they're doing a damned fine job so far.<p>If I were forced to try to turn yahoo around I'd start by identifying the major projects that yahoo should execute on and then I'd either fire almost everyone and start from scratch or I'd work by replacing the company from the inside out by growing a ""bubble"" that was a new division built with new rules with new management that hired both from outside the company and from within yahoo and was highly results oriented and, at least initially, worked on fast iteration projects that are easier to judge success on.<p>A couple good candidates for projects that could serve to help re-energize the company are flickr, yahoo stores, and yahoo hosting services.

5296192,comment,5295236,5295759,2,0,PeterisP,,,"All the problems are the integration with ""real money"", i.e., the account where you get your salary, the accont where your company pays salaries from, the card/whatever that you buy stuff with, and the card/whatever that you get cash from.<p>For that, you'd need to interchange payments with your system and bank accounts.<p>1) Gov't regulates financial institutions, and there are good reasons for it - otherwise Ponzi schemes and 'bankers' stealing deposits are a real pain and causes the public to ask for regulation. So they will want (force) you to submit to regulation if you want to do anything serious; or you may try to do ""only information"" and have another, licenced institution (a large bank) hold the actual money - this is what many finance startups do, but then they depend fully on the bank(s).<p>2) Gov't and banks don't like anonymous transactions, and there are good reasons for it - money laundering, tax evasion, organized crime and stolen money are very real issues. A basic principle is 'know your customer', i.e., don't do any [above $X] business with anyone you can't identify; and don't allow your customers to front payments on behalf of others, unless they identify all those others to you in each transaction. And it's often simpler/cheaper to disallow 'on behalf' deals at all than to integrate your customer/transaction data with the bank's systems. For example, see MtGox AML limits for money withdrawal - if you want to handle ""real money"", then that would apply for all transactions, not just withdrawals.<p>3) There are a bunch of consumer protection laws that may hurt you. For example, if a customer's account is hacked and money transferred, above a certain limit you (not the customer) will be liable for the loss. And there are other cases as well. So you (as the organizer) really, really want a money system where payments are (a) traceable, (b) revocable if legally required and (c) can't easily go to any other untraceable, irrevocable systems. Banks do so. The alternative is to charge huge fees to cover the risks to you.<p>4) Payment systems (ACH/etc) require huge collaterals or guarantees from participants - and there are good reasons for it, as you don't want to receive a gazillion payments, give the money to your customers, and then have the payer institution say that they're insolvent and won't cover the bill for the payment-messages that they sent. Technical and legal barriers to joining are also quite high.",1362012747

b) they're unintelligent<p>I'd say ~90% of kids fall into the former group. Coding is not something that you can just pick up a book and learn; it's something that takes <i>time</i>. It takes a hell of a lot of dedication, practice, and failure to master. Compare it to learning a spoken language; conventions of that language are likely different from English or whatever the learner's first language is, but the structure of the sentences, unless you're learning Hebrew or Yiddish, is more or less the same.<p>With coding, it's a mess. Nobody knows how to relate block structures to anything they've learned previously. It drives you insane for a while, but you warm up to it. It took me 3 years to finally understand many concepts that were presented to me in the many books, manuals, and docs that I perused throughout my learning experience.<p>And even then, I'm not done. New things are constantly to be learned, and everything I've learned I have to constantly apply to something else. If I want to learn to write GTK+ programs, I'll have to go back to a reference guide to see what several function calls actually mean.<p>Coding isn't impossible for kids to learn. While it is hard, it's not impossible. Start out with something like FBC or Scratch, and then give them more control through Python, which will guide them towards more complex languages like C/C++/Java. Anyone who starts teaching an 8th-grader how to code C/C++ with no prior experience, is frankly an idiot. Interest in coding is never ephemeral iff the learner is introduced to it properly.",1362012648

I think Bitcoin's creator thought a deflationary policy would help generate initial support for bitcoin by encouraging people to become invested. Arguably, without a deflationary policy bitcoin would never have caught on as it has.<p>Probably the most practical way to actually change the policy is to create an alternate 'bitcoin-2' network with a better (inflationary) policy. You could even allow transactions from the old network into the new one thus allowing people to carry their wealth over. If everyone agreed it was better, it would happen. The challenge is more social than technical.<p>For now though, it doesn't matter since the current bitcoin 'fiscal policy' is fairly expansionary (bitcoins are still being generated) and will be for years, and anyway the effect of 'fiscal policy' on bitcoin value is currently dwarfed by the effects of speculation and the increasing demand for bitcoins.",1362012105

Randomization.<p>Do not make something where players are recompensed when doing a super skilled move, like a headshot.  Or you'll have aimbots.  As simple as that.  Player has a shotgun?  Make it fire 30 miny bullets at once with some server-side randomization (that's how many shotguns work btw).<p>Do not want to give info about the other side of the map so that a rogue bot cannot shift to the correct strategy automatically ?  Use server-side fog of war.  That way the very info needed to ""map hack"" simply is NOT available on the client.<p>It is hard to combat all forms of cheating.  But maphack can definitely be mitigated and randomization can really help with many aimbots.<p>Regarding the ""highlight players behind walls"": two things to do.  1) do not allow to fire through walls (unless the first Counter-Strike, which was totally silly in that you could fire through 2-meters wide wall with a simple pistol) and 2) server-side fog-of-war.  Do simply not send to the client the info that would allow the client to determine that an ennemy is behind the wall too early.<p>Sure, at one point you need to give the info: give it as late as possible and make is so ""super crazy high reflex"" are not rewarded in an insane way.  For example make it slower to ""switch gears"", etc.<p>It all comes to a balance between fun and anti-cheat but <i>many</i> things can be done to make cheaters life way harder and, most importantly, way less efficient.",1362011445

Before I pay the rent, I explicitly agree to it and can negotiate a duration to ensure that it does not rise tomorrow by 100%. And I can avoid it altogether. Tax I have to pay first, talk about second. And it's not avoidable. Also, if I don't pay the rent because the property owner has failed his obligations, I can negotiate with other people to ostracize him, so he will have to improve his behaviour (voluntarily), or lose customers. If then I fail to clear the property, then he can negotiate with others to ostracize me, or I will have nothing to eat and drink. All of this is possible without violence, but not possible when anyone can go to court and relatively cheaply hire all prisons, police and bureaucracy (very well paid by all taxpayers, not by actual users).<p>So no, it's not moral to have a well-funded lawsuit by a private party because it replaces negotiation with force.

5296079,comment,5295618,5295618,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"It seems to me like Yahoo has several years of undesirable cultural legacy. The company needs to reinvent itself. Redefining WFH is a part of that, but the problem is that there are a large number of things that Yahoo needs to do and getting the order right is important. Cracking down on WFH before dealing with the other problems is a bad call.<p>The real question is: why are there so many unmotivated, unproductive people? Is it bad hiring or bad project management? I don't think there are a large number of intrinsic underperformers, so much as people demotivated by contexts that leave no real opportunities for achievement. Perhaps there are a lot of pointless projects that have no career upside, but that people can't escape from, so they use the bog as an excuse to retire on-the-job. I'm not saying that that's right-- it's not-- but, if this is the case, then it's important to deal with the underlying problem instead of the symptom only.<p>One of the things that executives get wrong on this is that, if you want to preserve morale, you've got to put a ""shit sandwich"" (good-bad-good pattern) around your crackdown. First, you do something related and good for the employees (like give them more opportunities to pick what they work on). Then, you deliver the crackdown (reduced WFH). Finally, once you've achieved what you're looking for, you scale the crackdown back or add a perk that makes it more acceptable.",1362011132

5296074,comment,5295034,5296026,6,0,ahomescu1,,,"Here's my understanding of why each pointer is needed, from reading the Zend source code for a while:<p>1) The innermost pointer is needed because Zend hash tables actually store a ""zval* "" (pointer to zval), not a zval directly. The zval is allocated separately, then its pointer is stored into the table.<p>2) The second pointer is needed because Zend tables internally malloc storage for whatever they store (zval* ) in this case, then access that data as a pointer. The ""zval* "" pointer is memcpy'd into the malloc'd area. This data is accessed through a ""zval* * "" pointer. This allows users of zend_hash_xxx to not only access the ""zval* "" pointer, but also change it.<p>3) In C, one way for a function to return a value is by passing a pointer to a variable that will store the result. Since zend_hash_find returns the internal ""zval* * "" data, you need to pass in a ""zval* * * "" pointer to a ""zval* * "" pointer that is the actual return value you want. Through this ""zval* * "" pointer, you can read and also change the ""zval* "" data stored in that hash table cell.",1362011094

Only few people are happily using state violence for their benefit. Others simply have no choice: if you don't go to court, your opponent may drag you in. Or you cannot protect yourself because only official police has a right to do that, so you have to agree with their terms without much negotiation. In cases where people have no choice, there is not capacity for morality and I cannot blame them for using courts. It's still the state who has capacity not to use violence and hence can be viewed as moral or immoral.<p>Think of it in terms of ability to negotiate: when protecting yourself against theft, you can negotiate about installing locks and protection, about face-control, reputation points, ostracism etc. When you have a universal system of violence, there is no negotiation. You simply beg the court for appealing to you. They have much more power over you. Yes, it can be nominally limited, but not by you anyway.

Women approaching guys or being approached, romantically, has nothing to do with their ability to be leaders in the workforce. Zero. And to take the attitude that they need to ""step up"" in order to earn equality, is totally wrong. Equality is a legal and ethical thing, it doesn't mean you have to do <i>anything</i>.<p>The fact is, women like to be approached, much more than they like approaching. It's not even very much a cultural thing as far as I can tell, since it's like that in pretty much every country (there are <i>plenty</i> of exceptions, of course, but I'm talking about in general, overall). It's just how people are.<p>On the other hand, it can be unfortunate. Take OkCupid -- guys will generally message lots of girls. They have to, because the girls aren't sending many messages. There's no kind of inherent problem there, most girls just want to browse their inbox and occasionally write back to a guy that seems all right.<p>But when girls complain about how OkCupid ""doesn't work"", I tell them that's also because they're not being proactive. A guy might browse through 200 profiles in an hour; a girl might get messages from 200 guys over the course of a couple of months (it varies a lot). It's going to take her a lot longer to find the ""right"" guy. So while there's nothing inherently wrong with women wanting to be approached, at the same time they have to realize that if they want to find the right guy, they're going to have a lot more success if they learn to approach, too.

You're in your trench in dirty clothes, you can feel your feet rotting away inside your boots as you stand in knee deep water, mud, and filth. Most of the buddies you had a year ago are dead or gone away, having lost limbs or sanity in the war already. You spend your days watching your squad mates shit their guts out from dysentery. You've been over the top before, you've run across hundreds of meters of cratered moonscape filled with mud and barbed wire, all the soldiers around you are getting ripped apart by ferocious machine gun fire. And you know how futile it is to attack enemy trenches head on. You've seen thousands upon thousands of men killed by shelling and machine gun fire before they even got close to the other trench, it's a suicidal strategy and yet it is the only strategy the commanders have come up with. You think about deserting. You think about getting a group of friends together to rise up against the officers. But your friends are dead or gone, and desertion or rebellion are a certain route to execution. You start to think seriously about acquiring some sort of injury that would send you home, maybe if you shot your own foot. But your thoughts are interrupted by the announcement that tomorrow morning there is another attack planned, you're going to go over the top and attack the enemy trenches again.<p>Your morale, and everyone else's, in this situation is obviously low. The solution the commanders have for this problem is that if you don't do your job you'll be shot. The result of this genius was the destruction of a significant percentage of an entire generation. The problem in this situation wasn't the soldiers. As many historians have detailed many of them ""fought like lions"", and many of them were intrinsically motivated to fight the enemy to the utter limit of their abilities. But morale was still low and a lot of people deserted and some even rebelled. The problem was the strategy and the commanders. The problem was that the actions being undertaken were hugely wasteful of men and resources without having any reasonable chance of success.<p>You don't win this sort of war by ordering yet another mass assault backed up with the threat that anyone who doesn't comply with the order will be executed. You fix it by changing your strategy and tactics.",1362010268

A user loads the first page of the app. There is a small script (index.php) that serves all front-end requests. It checks if the page being loaded has already been scraped and if so, injects the content into the main template, otherwise  fires off a queued job to scrape that page and loads the app regardless.<p>2. The queue job forks out to phantomjs with the page URL, which listens on the page for a ""page-loaded"" event, and upon a) this event being fired or b) the scrape timing out, returns whatever HTML content in the main content area (as well as any <head> tags) to the queue worker, which updates a database table with url -> content mappings.<p>3. The next time someone directly loads the page, that content is pulled and injected.<p>4. Scraped content expires after a certain amount of time. If expired content is pulled out, it is put into the HTML for that page, and a queue item is fired to re-scrape.<p>The obvious problem is that the page must be primed for content to show up, which you can fix by a) either having lots of visitors :) or b) using/building a simple crawler.<p>Also, when facebook scrapes our page to look for og: tags, we do the scrape synchronously which takes longer, but ensures that the page's content is always available. The same could be done for googlebot, but it's more dangerous since rankings depend on page load speed.<p>As for our rankings, they are fairly high (it's the same as any app that serves HTML directly would be since we are literally just serving delayed HTML content).<p>So no, it's not just theory; we do it on Musio.com quite successfully.

Many managers, particularly first-level leads, tend to pull their rewards towards the mean (barely rewarding high performers and still rewarding low performers) instead of focusing on doing the right thing at the tails. Though that's certainly no guarantee of success; I got a decently sized development and test organization (~60 of each) merged into our organization and it took nearly a month of full-time work for myself (and one of my peers) to sort out the years of misrewarded individuals to get neglected high performers promoted and HR action started on people who'd been resting and vesting.",1362009926

I am not entirely sure where this idea came from.  Can you <i>prove</i> it, the way that ECDSA (on which Bitcoin is based) can be proved secure as a signature system?  When I hear this sort of statement, it sounds a lot like, ""Nobody has published any way to double spend cheaply, and I cannot think of one; therefore it must be an expensive thing to do!""<p>I do not mean to be insulting with that, I really would like to know why people think double spending attacks are <i>necessarily</i> expensive.  On top of that, how do we know that a double spending attack would be <i>more</i> expensive than the payoff -- especially when you are dealing with a complex marketplace, where a double spending attack may be just one component of a larger scheme.  Maybe the point will just be to deny another person the ability to buy something, by double-spending until the merchant is sold out of the item, or as shills in an auction to try to inflate the price (should Amazon revive its auctions system).<p>This reminds me of the sort of argument I had with Hushmail users back before the infamous DEA incident.  Your secret key is sitting there, on their servers; they could read your mail if they wanted to or if someone had a gun to their head.  People said it couldn't happen, that the key would only be in RAM for a split second, that using their Java applet solved the problem, etc.  Then the DEA turned up in court with a mountain of decrypted email from Hushmail (and then, as if the entire world just wanted to aggravate me, people starting saying that PGP had security problems).  Cryptography tends to be black-and-white when it comes to security:  you are either secure, or you are not secure, and there is rarely anything in-between (with multiparty computation, that might be changing; people are now talking about the ""covert model"" and ""one-bit leakage"" notions of security, which are in that middle area).",1362009825

Roundness of Earth was also considered extreme, that does not change its validity.<p>You say I'm extending definition of ""threat of murder"" to everyone. That's true, but it's not their fault. If we both have a thing called ""court"", then even if I don't want myself to inflict violence on you, I'm not sure you won't use the court against me. Since the court has the last word and all the guns in the world, I have no choice, but to protect myself by either fleeing from the jurisdiction or using the court against you. It's absolutely the same with patents: Apple and Google are buying up patents because if one of them does not, they will be damaged by others. You could blame them only if they had voluntarily established such a destructive system for themselves, but they did not. Patent cross-licensing is an evidence that people do not like fighting with each other: by doing cross-licensing two entities expect to reduce amount of stupid fight. Of course, human nature is not perfect and some people who are born into this system, feel they have a full moral right to use it for their benefit. E.g. recent war of Apple against Samsung is mostly proactive use of violence that was sold via patents. But even here, the problem does not begin with Apple, but with those who controls the guns (Apple only hired some of them).<p>Without state some people can still voluntarily fund an agency with guns, courts, licensing and patents. But it will be very different from today's situation. Because today the violence is paid by taxpayers, not the actual users. So when some army of lawyers wants to press you for copying a file, it is not them who pay for prosecutors, lawmakers, prisons, police, propaganda, army and huge bureaucracy. Lawyers spend their salary not on guns and prisons, but on iPods and spa. So how about trying to build an army of policemen using private funds? What would be the business model? Who would risk putting money in the enterprise?<p>If you seriously fear that someone could earn a $billion and then risk all of it to build a James Bond-style corporation of evil, then you for sure cannot advocate the state - a monopoly on violence funded by forcible extraction instead of voluntary investment. Did you notice that all of evil guys in James Bond movies were either government-funded or absolutely economically impossible (how would you gather 1000 engineers to build a secret nuclear weapon without massive public propaganda that military spendings are good for ""society"")? All real big mafia structures exist with governmental support. And the bigger they are - the more support they have. Actually, the government is simply a name for the biggest organized thugs in a given region.<p>Ultimately, it boils down to existence of choice: those who have no choice are not moral agents. If someone attacks me, I will defend myself, but I cannot justify any violence and I don't need to - I simply have no choice. If we both are in a situation when court ruling will put one of us in jail, we have no choice but to play this game. Are we morally responsible for this? Not as much, as the prosecutor, who sure has a choice to not threaten either of us. Equally, if someone steals a wallet from you, and you do not expect any violent threat from this guy, would you think it's morally justified to catch him and put in jail? If he cannot give you wallet back without you breaking his neck, would you prefer to let him go and make sure he never steals again (using doors, locks, reputation, insurance, ostracism), or will you threaten him with physical violence? If latter, would you institutionalize this threat of violence (and accept a risk of getting hit by it), or you'd rather not give anyone ultimate power and seek more preventive solutions?<p>If you can hire a protection agency voluntarily, would you require maximum transparency of its operations and other proofs that they cannot kill people arbitrarily and would immediately lose a lot of money in case everyone withdraws their contracts? If you want to be an armed guard, you sure will have to prove to everyone how they will punish you effectively in case of a corruption. Without such proof, no one will hire you. If you would require such transparency and strict controls as a customer of protection agency, why is it okay to have a government who was not established with your consent and which cannot be affected directly and immediately in case of misbehavior, but on contrary is forcing you to fund it anyway? It is huge logical mistake to fear a violent guy in a free market and at the same time allow a system of monopoly of such violence that surely will attract people who'd love to use such power.",1362009638

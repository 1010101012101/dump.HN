For your average bank trying to do a quick sale they might get ~80% or less of the appraised value depending on a host of factors which is why 20% down payments are considered so important.  As to mortgages if you look at the mortgage resale market you again need to subtract servicing costs which significantly impact actual value.",1381080012

One example where this approach obviously wasn&#x27;t taken was early Android builds (at least on the HTC Hero). I emailed support because it started to take 15+ seconds for a sent/received message to appear in the message list and the support engineer said it was because the whole list had to be raised into memory, the message appended, and then the list written out.

4906464,comment,4904914,4906187,2,0,kyllo,,,"The non-dischargeability of student loans matters because it significantly reduces the lender's risk of taking a loss. Even if the student doesn't have the income to service the loan debt within 5-10 years after graduating, the lender will still recoup their investment, with interest, if the person <i>ever</i> makes enough income to pay it down in their entire lifetime. And the lender is near the front of the line for collections (just behind things like the IRS and child support). So the only case in which the lender takes a loss on their investment is if the borrower dies before they can pay it off. In the aggregate this is a very small risk.<p>Student loans are not all government loans, maybe 70% are Federal Student Aid loans. Both FSA loans and subsidized private loans are subsidized by the government, which only means that the government pays the portion of the interest that would be due while the student is still in school. But it does not matter whether the lender is the government or a bank--the loans still carry an interest rate and are still non-dischargeable. The government cannot ""just tax the rich"" to pay off students' loan balances, the government does not work that way.",1355255771

If it's a startup where it's not even clear whether you're going to get the next round of funding, maybe taking the time to invest in making your software more maintainable doesn't matter; letting technical debt build up might be acceptable.<p>But there is a reason why open source projects care very much about the underlying quality of the code from an aesthetics point of view, and that's because we need to worry about the long-term maintainability of the code after we accept a code contribution.   Even if the startup goes belly up, you can reuse open source code.  Proprietary code is much less likely to be reused, and besides, once the startup fails and you are fired and the assets get sold off, why would you care about how maintainable the code will be?  It's very unlikely you'll ever get the chance to work on it again....<p>But in the case of open source code, caring about the craft of writing good, maintainable, elegant, easy-to-understand code <i>is</i> important.

My laptop has 8GB of ram, also 64bit, and I'm pretty sure I've never had a single process use 4GB. The only exception I can think of was doing some silly data manipulation, e.g. doing the initial build of a property graph of the entire Boston area transit system.  I bet some high end games or video/photo editing software would use more than 4GB.  Point is, those are all pretty niche situations, I'd bet the majority of memory usage on an average person's computer comes from browser processes, few hundred MB each if that and office applications, also a few hundred MB.  Those processes add up though, so having more ram is usually a really good thing even if no processes uses even close to 4GB.<p>I also challenge the need in server loads.  I'd bet the vast majority of applications never use 4GB either on the app server or the database server.  Most of what gets discussed here on HN are large high scalability applications that you wouldn't host on ARM cores anyway.

You don't need to start complex; it will come to you. Complexity should come from the problem being solved. Self-modifying code is ""fun"" and also completely unmaintainable. Same with code that uses a lot of inheritance (except in GUIs, where inheritance is a natural fit). It might be ""fun"" to write but it's hideous to maintain. It's better to point that creativity in the direction of <i>clean</i> code that teaches other people how to use it and how the problem is solved.<p>Code aesthetics cannot be compromised, but code beauty doesn't mean complexity or adornment. It means functional simplicity and ease of learning.

4906217,comment,4905914,4905914,1,0,Mz,,,"The cathedral example does not work. The author clearly explains how the aesthetic of a cathedral helps put people in the right reverent frame of mind to worship, which is the action they are there to perform, then dismisses that beauty as not functional, as mere aesthetic. It seems clear to me if the design helps them get in the right frame if mind, it is functional. Furthermore, historically, the point of stained glass windows was to share some of the stories of the bible with a largely illiterate population. Again, it was beautiful but not merely decorative. The art of the cathedral had purpose and function.<p>I have a Certifucate in GIS. The mapmaking class I took emphasized the fact that a good map -- one well designed for its intended purpose of efficiently conveying information -- will be perceived as ""beautiful"" in much the same way that good engineering is typically perceived as aesthetically appealling but a beautiful map is not necessarily a good map. In organizations where GIS is not well integrated, you wind up with ""map shops"" who are not involved in any really important part of collecting the data or using it. Their only role is to make maps for the people who do use the data. Map shops inevitably become obsessed with making beautiful maps, to the point where embellishment may well interfere with effective use of the map.<p>I have come to believe that beauty (of all kinds) is valued because it is a qick and dirty proxy for real value since things which are well designed seem to universally have visual appeal. Therefore, if it is not aesthetically appealling, it probably is not really all that good in terms of quality. I think beauty then also gets routinely maligned because it can be a quick and dirty means to fake value, to falsely signal value, when it doesn't really exist. I think this conflict will never be resolved because both things will remain true. We will continue to remark with awe and wonder on the ""beauty"" of high quality work and continue to deride low quality work which tries to cover up its defects by slathering it in prettiness.<p>For those adequately in the know to understand the code, there will continue to be people who talk about programming in terms of ""beauty"". For those not in the know, it is too abstract to ""see"" the beauty of it.",1355253478

They don't need to know the gritty details of how things are encoded and enumerated, but they do need to be aware of the entities and their relationships. This is true for <i>any</i> kind of user, savvy or not.<p>Deep usability problems happen when the application omits, hides or distorts aspects of the model that the user is manipulating. For example:<p>- inline formatting codes in word processors<p>- fake folders in filesystems e.g. My Documents<p>- ""apply"" button in dialogs<p>- wizards<p>Design should start with the user model, then create the user interface to manipulate it. The internal model can be different from the user model but they should have a one-to-one mapping.",1219485594

But here is another example of the power of Ruby metaprogramming. The example is sort of nuts, but something similar is actually used in the Camping microwebframework.<p><pre><code>    Blah = {\n      :foo => proc { puts ""foo"" },\n      :bar => proc { puts ""bar"" },\n      :baz => proc { puts ""baz"" }\n    }\n\n    def Monkey(method)\n      klass = Class.new\n      klass.class_eval do\n        define_method :shout do\n          Blah[method].call\n        end\n      end\n      return klass\n    end\n\n    class Chimp < Monkey(:foo)\n    end\n\n    class Gorilla < Monkey(:bar)\n    end\n\n    a = Chimp.new\n    a.shout # => ""foo""\n\n    b = Gorilla.new\n    b.shout # => ""bar""\n\n    Blah[:foo] = proc { puts ""I have changed"" }\n    a.shout # => ""I have changed""</code></pre>",1219484733

284543,comment,284503,284528,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"I agree that ""large hierarchies"" may be an overstatement, but it is worth remembering that Alexander does not concentrate total responsibility for the design of a signle in the hands of a single architect, or even a firm of architects, but rather, involves a large number of ""end-users""-- and then iterates this notion both upward (to city planning) and downward (to interior design of individual rooms), so while the ""hierarchy"" may be relatively flat, the problem of distributed responsiblity is a real one (and a relevant one for software).",1219483768

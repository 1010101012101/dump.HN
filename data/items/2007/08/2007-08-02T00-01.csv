I don't see any ethical dilemma in this.",1186015364

A lot of people are spending a LOT of money on eyeballs and a lot of people have lost track that eyeballs and revenue don't necessarily mean the same thing.<p>There also seems to be a general disregard for business models (which I know can come later, but it's GOT to come SOMETIME).",1186015326

38548,comment,38450,38450,0,0,drm237,,,"I disagree.  I think the last bubble was marked by the high number of tech IPOs that were so over valued.

So, I don't believe it's really going to burst.  When everything catches up, a lot of VCs will be out of a lot of money, but if you have a good idea and a solid audience, you'll be ok.",1186015031

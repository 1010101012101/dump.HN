I had also already taken AP CS in high school, and CS101 in college. I did well in both. But despite this I basically wasn&#x27;t able to code my way out of a paper bag.<p>Why?<p>Firstly, C++ and Java aren&#x27;t commonly used in (successful) web startups.&quot;<p>Are you saying you knew C++ and Java prior to this?  I would have thought this would be a great jumping off point into other languages - I found the switch from C++ to Python to be surprisingly easy.<p>Also while start-ups may tend to stick to Ruby or Python, many web companies use Java or Scala (Twitter is probably the highest profile company I can think of).  They tend to be higher scale though and it is probably harder to get started with them than with Python or Ruby.",1383775190
6685796,comment,6685403,6685403,1,0,pedalpete,,,"I disagree with this article which makes it seem like anybody who has a dislike for the TSA is being manipulated by anti-union PR campaign.<p>The truth is that the TSA is the physical embodiment of the nanny-state which most people experience. We are never physically confronted by government data-mining, most police activity, CTV cameras, etc. etc. But we do physically come face to face with the TSA, they ask us for our IDs, go through our belongings, make us remove articles of clothing, etc. etc.<p>We see other people get herded like sheep along with us, we see children being patted down (I see this more in Canada than in any other country I&#x27;ve visited, I know it&#x27;s not the TSA, but the equivelant), my mother had her knitting needles confiscated, these are real things being done by the government(s), and we as people who have been promised freedom and autonomy know that it isn&#x27;t right. Our feeling are hurt, we feel our liberties being taken away. We&#x27;re more afraid of the TSA than we are of any terrorists. We don&#x27;t look at the TSA and say &quot;thanks for keeping us safe&quot;, because we know they aren&#x27;t.<p>The reason the TSA has become so powerful may well be because of a bunch of lobbying and the introduction of a union, but that isn&#x27;t why we dislike them.",1383775185

6685792,comment,6683866,6683866,3,0,Sheepshow,,,"The newer JPEG algorithm JPEG2000 uses Wavelet Transforms which is kind of similar to the Fourier. The Fourier applies a finite window then decomposes into a sum of infinite waveforms. The Wavelet on the other hand applies no windowing function, and directly decomposes the signal into a sum of _finite_ waveforms.<p>The Fourier has the disadvantage that you can&#x27;t arrange the components into a time hierarchy; that is, no component occurs &quot;before&quot; any other.<p>The Wavelet transform _does_ have a natural time hierarchy. This makes it much better for streaming compression like voice calls.<p>The Fourier perfectly describes signals of infinite duration (think tone or color) while the Wavelet perfectly describes the position of things within a signal (think rhythm or space).<p>With the Fourier filtering is really easy. You can do hard, hard cutoffs -- literally no contributions within a certain frequency band -- just by removing components of the decomposition. Similarly, you can accurately apply any arbitrary mathematical filtering function.<p>The disadvantage of the Wavelet is that, well, the only meaningful transformation you can apply to it is compression -- dropping the shorter timescale components. If you want to filter, it&#x27;s not enough to trim off timescale components because the wavelet itself can contain any frequency components. There&#x27;s also nothing like a simple mathematical function you can apply to the coefficients to get a smooth filter.<p>Neat!",1383775156

While I don&#x27;t support the notion that any company or person should <i>have</i> to support <i>any</i> version of OS or browser, knowing the massive effect that Google has on the web market and the fact that they have their own browser, if there is any attempt to specifically lock out older competing browsers, the FTC or EU might have questions about that. If you&#x27;re pushing to be number one in a massive market, you have to play by different rules (as Microsoft found out in the 90&#x27;s).<p>Google hasn&#x27;t been playing nice with Microsoft for a while (see how many Google apps are in the Windows Phone store, the issue where they locked out IE Mobile from viewing Google Maps, or how they treat Windows Phone trying to interface with YouTube). In a way it&#x27;s nice to see Microsoft reaping what they&#x27;ve sown so long ago, but in another way it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating from an end user perspective to be someone who likes Microsoft software (such as Windows Phone) and also enjoy using Google services like Maps and Youtube.<p>Google should be careful with how much they&#x27;re pushing against Microsoft, especially with Microsoft&#x27;s new market position versus Google.

The latter is often measured with various approximations to human perception of sound - psychoacoustics.

Well, I don&#x27;t mind MP3s (or AACs or OGGs for that matter), and I certainly can&#x27;t tell the difference between them and lossless formats, but an MP3 that has been re-encoded several times is really atrocious. It&#x27;s like when you re-compress a jpg a few times, it gets messy. This helps definitively figure out what an MP3 really is or was. Sometimes the tags on the MP3 lie about which encoder was used or what the compression settings were. Other times, the file used to be something else, such as re-encoding a 128kbps MP3 as a LAME V0 preset MP3. Looking at the frequency plot in a sound editor makes this rather obvious, as the lower presets and crummier encoders have much lower lowpass filters.",1383773444

But certainly these other crimes have significantly less profit/risk than the huge markup on illegal drugs?<p>If they are properly legalized, the price should plummet. So even stealing or going wholesale is far less lucrative. You can already steal other goods. You could hijack a shipment of beer - but end-users aren&#x27;t going to pay $15 a bottle for it because the normal price is known to be far less. So even if these organizations moved into theft, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to finance huge armies anymore.<p>I&#x27;d also note that stealing does not have a cost of zero. You need to finance people to attack, pay for their weapons, etc. And the cap on pricing means even if stealing was cheaper, the absolute profit still won&#x27;t be as high, overall.<p>Unless Brazil has a problem with criminal gangs already monopolizing distribution of other goods (like aspirin, tabacco, or alcohol), it seems like a stretch to say they&#x27;d do this for drugs.<p>Even in the US, people have been killed in hijackings of trucks containing Intel processors.",1383772955

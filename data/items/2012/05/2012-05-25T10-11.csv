Another cool thing replicateM is equivalent to: for lists, it's the cartesian power (sequence is the cartesian product).  ...this is actually the primary reason I'm aware of it.",1337943590

Currently there is no known technology that would allow them to avoid heavy reliance on carbon based energy sources while that transformation occurs. It's easy to sit on our 1st world thrones and imagine that if only we drove our cars a bit less everything will be fine, in reality the issue is about holding back people who are living in poverty, who don't have access to modern medicine, who don't all have access to clean water, etc. It puts into perspective the putative hazards of global warming to weigh against the cost of holding half the population of Earth in poverty.",1337943431

      // Overwrite the callback with a recursive version:
      var recursiveCallback = function(i) {
        // Call the original callback

        }
      };
      // Start recursing with the start value
      recursiveCallback(initial());

Which transforms our for loop example to:<p><pre><code>    recurseBetween(function() {
      return 1;
    }, function(i) {
      return i<=10;
    }, function(i) {
      return i++;
    }, function(i) {
      console.log(i);
    });

Which at first glance is unwieldy, but gives complete control to the calling script, such that we could do things like introduce a step:<p><pre><code>    recurseBetween(function() {
      return 1;
    }, function(i) {
      return i<=100;
    }, function(i) {
      return i+=10;
    }, function(i) {
      console.log(i);
    });
</code></pre>
Or even more exotic things.<p>In reality, this syntax is too complicated. I would probably introduce some helpers; eg you could pass in a straight integer <i>or</i> a function and it would deal with it. I'd also probably send the arguments as named parameters so the syntax looked like this instead:<p><pre><code>    recurseBetween({
      'start': 1,
      'end': 100,
      'modify': function(i) {
        return i+=10;
      },
      'callback': function(i) {
        console.log(i);
      }
    });
</code></pre>
Which is a little clearer. Obviously the example is somewhat contrived because in reality you'd just use a for loop! But an interesting exercise nonetheless.",1337942121

      // Create a recursive function
      // which checks the limits and calls the supplied callback
      var recursiveCallback = function(i) {
        // Call the original callback
        callback(i);
        // If we're at the end, stop
        if(i >= end) {
          return;
        } else {
          // Else increment and recurse
          recursiveCallback(++i);
        }
      };
      // Start recursing with the start value
      recursiveCallback(start);
    }
</code></pre>
Now you can use recurseBetween almost exactly as you would a for loop:<p><pre><code>    recurseBetween(1, 10, function(i) {
      console.log(i);
    });
</code></pre>
You could even abstract the start and max arguments as callbacks, and you could supply a callback to perform the increment too so that you're not limited to integral addition.",1337941011

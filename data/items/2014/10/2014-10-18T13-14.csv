8475316,comment,8474032,8474032,0,0,nness,,,"I think a rookie mistake that gets made is to argue that they should be paid based on the marked rate.<p>Knowing what the going rate is is an important base for understanding the direction in which your career will develop, and what you should expect in remuneration as it develops. But, I feel it is foolish to go into that negotiation and say &quot;salary averages say I should earn X, therefore, pay me X.&quot;<p>What you may end up finding is that if you ask for market rate, you&#x27;ll hear &quot;if you can fetch that in the market, go to the market.&quot; Market rates are an average, a very broad average, that does not always take into account your geography, your industry and any specialisation you have. Some companies will value more, some less.<p>A better way to approach that discussion is to understand your remuneration is based on some contractual period, namely 12 months. What you need to do is work with your employer to set how those next 12 months should be valued. It&#x27;s all about trajectory. If you&#x27;ve had a few years of positive development, it should be an easy case to make that the trend will continue upwards.<p>It&#x27;s also an interesting test, if you can&#x27;t see how your next year will provide increase value to the organisation, it may show early signs of changes that are about to occur internally. That said, if you have an actual offer, that&#x27;s a different discussion.",1413640415

I tried to repair it: I ran the code in a fresh Emacs session to which my usual customizations in .emacs had not been applied. I set lexical-binding to t. Since beep is an alias for ding, I replaced beep with ding. I rewrote the letf as a cl-flet.<p>I think that the fact that scroll-up is built-in is pertinent: there was another incident in the recent past in which the function whose binding I wanted to override (&quot;shadow&quot;?) is called from a built-in function and in which my attempt to use cl-flet to override the binding failed.<p>If you have Emacs running on a Windows or Linux machine, I would like to know whether the above code causes a beep on that machine. I would like to know because in the past, code that gets a little tricky about bindings that worked on my friend&#x27;s Windows box failed to work on my Mac (even with an up-to-date Emacs).<p>ADDED: Actually, let me show you the code that &quot;worked&quot; (i.e., behaved like someone familiar with Scheme or Haskell would expect modulo the trivial &quot;rigamarole&quot; of needing to use funcall) on my friend&#x27;s Windows box but not on my Mac.

The living-within-one&#x27;s-means thing was just an example.  There are tons of reasons why you might <i>want</i> more money, but very few where you actually <i>need</i> it, assuming you&#x27;ve made reasonably good financial choices up to that point.  And yeah, even with the best intentions regarding money, sometimes people still get kicked in the ass, but I still question if &quot;having some bad luck with money&quot; is a reasonable justification for giving someone a raise.  I&#x27;m fairly convinced it isn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the one-person-decides bit really applies here.  I object to &quot;personal needs&quot; being used as evidence for or against giving someone a raise, regardless of whether it&#x27;s one person making the decision or many, or whether it&#x27;s made by someone who knows the person and their work deeply, or only has superficial knowledge.

8475289,comment,8474032,8474032,0,0,spatulon,,,"I recently negotiated a significant raise with my boss. Some of the main points I made to him were:<p>1) That I&#x27;m the de facto lead engineer on a product that&#x27;s making €X million per year while also strategically important for the company. i.e. I&#x27;m valuable to the company and would appreciate them acknowledging that via the well-understood language of money.<p>2) That my raise would be small change to the company in the grand scheme of things.<p>3) That I could expect to walk into a different job at the salary I was asking my boss for, and have been considering doing so.<p>4) That if I left, he&#x27;d expect to pay an equivalently experienced replacement a similar amount, while also suffering the pain of upheaval on a small development team.<p>So I tried to keep it balanced between reasons why it would be good for both me and the company to give me the raise, while leaving him clear about the consequences of not doing so.<p>Note that I didn&#x27;t have a job offer from elsewhere to use as leverage, but in my case the threat of leaving seemed to concern him sufficiently (recruiting good developers is pretty tough in northern England) that it worked almost as well. However, it still left me in a weak position when he asked me for a number.<p>I should also note that I was extremely nervous about championing myself so overtly, and it didn&#x27;t come naturally at all (we programmers are excessively meek at times). I&#x27;m happy to report that none of the disastrous consequences I&#x27;d imagined in my head came to fruition, and my boss reacted extremely positively.",1413639258

Did his team members not feel comfortable talking to him about it, or perhaps even the other cofounders, until the situation reached a boiling point? Did other team members know they had an open communication channel to provide feedback about a cofounder?<p>Unless the issues he describes are intrinsic personality quirks -- in which case he probably needs to understand his tendencies and find an environment where he can thrive -- this whole situation seems avoidable. All employees, but especially managers, should create time and space to have candid, mostly unstructured one-on-one conversations with a handful of direct reports / superiors / peers. Leaders should invite criticism from the very beginning and make sure everyone knows it&#x27;s safe to challenge ideas and decisions. And ideally, this starts during the hiring process. Let potential employees know that you value productive dissent and do your best to evaluate them on that axis.<p>If you don&#x27;t have people within the company that can effectively evaluate you, find someone outside of the company that can provide advice. This seems more common at the (co)founder level, although could apply e.g. to a technical person at a highly non-technical company as well.<p>EDIT: As a cofounder, he had the power to engineer some of these support structures himself.

The stuff here is what you need to know in order to get started analyzing music of the common practice period (you&#x27;d need set theory to talk about the pitch content of most music after 1900). But when people get doctorates in music theory, they are not stil studying the circle of fifths. They use these concepts to describe music in order to come to some understanding of how and why it is structured.",1413637978

I just can&#x27;t get used to the UI inconsistencies and starkness of the UI.<p>Also, the Preview app renders PDFs completely differently on non-retina screens now. The text is way lighter and blurrier than on all previous releases, which is unacceptable to me (I have huge collection of documents and books in PDF format that I read and search through all the time). Spotlight is now limited to smaller window to display its results, so you must scroll through them, which is also a usability regression.<p>If they ever create actual dark mode where the window titles are also dark (so the entire OS is like iPhoto or iMovies) then I will consider upgrading (I was also happy with the default UI in all previous releases by the way). But the way the OS looks now is just hideously ugly to me. I hate the all white everything, and I hate the inconsistency of &quot;dark&quot; theme if it can be called that, where menu bar and dock and folder grid views are dark but everything else is pale gray/white. Also the dock looks 2D but if you have dock magnification the icons pop out of the dock making it temporarily look like its 3D. Really silly.<p>I&#x27;m taken aback by the direction Apple is taking and regression in refinement and taste. I always wondered how long will it take for them to go from what they were to just another mediocre, faceless corporate software development company after Jobs. Apparently, not that long.",1413637890

It does create a weird conundrum that makes a lot of people want to solve with asinine and borderline unethical logic. You know you should be making more than you are, but your employer just won&#x27;t see that. The easy assumption to make is that your employer is being sociopathic and that you should be more sociopathic in return. &quot;It&#x27;s just business!&quot;<p>But the stakes are really high here. Your employer has a lot more to lose than you do if you jump ship over a relatively small amount of money. You took the job, so obviously it was right for you at some point. Did that really change just because they turned your raise request down? Do you really want to hang them out to dry over what&#x27;s essentially a misunderstanding? Don&#x27;t sacrifice your professionalism to feed your ego.<p>My solution is to just keep getting better and better until I can make my own opportunities.

Or trying to confound the dangers of indoor and outdoor ranges.  Or, heck, is there the slightest evidence they talked to anyone on my side about how we view this?<p>For that matter, the MSM&#x27;s <i>Der Stürmer</i> approach towards the NRA and gunowners suppresses membership in the former and therefore the education the latter might otherwise get from reading the member magazines.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m oversensitive, but being part of this fight since the early 1970s (sic) bias from the MSM is assumed and the tropes are trivial to detect.  Counterwise, not genuinely biased reporters and editors are so marinated in gun grabbing bias---as <i>you</i> are unless you read a <i>lot</i> from other sources to counter it, even if you&#x27;re an active gunowner, even a NRA member (or so surveys tell us about the latter)---they&#x27;ll automatically use them even if they weren&#x27;t really meaning to be biased.  Perhaps a style vs. substance problem, since the problem is real ... but, again, the dismissive attitude towards the NRA and the blackout on the NSSF shows the limits of their research, and at some point &quot;they&#x27;re the generically clueless MSM&quot; excuse doesn&#x27;t cut it.<p>Did the article give any examples of <i>customers</i> being harmed?  In these situations, it&#x27;s almost always an occupational danger, since owners, employees and volunteers get massively longer exposures, and are also responsible for cleaning the place, which can also expose them to lead fragments at the end of the range.  I think nowadays almost all centerfire bullets are jacketed, but ubiquitous and inexpensive (until very recently) .22 LR rimfire aren&#x27;t jacketed, or not seriously.  Probably less of a threa<p>I also wonder why OSHA and the state OSHAs aren&#x27;t on the ball.  The usual suspects on my side, the NRA and NSSF, are very serious about this (the exit of the very nice NRA&#x27;s HQ range in Virginia has two hand washing stations you can&#x27;t miss and as mentioned publicity of the dangers, and see <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=nssf+range+lead"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=nssf+range+lead</a>), they publicize the dangers, the NSSF helps ranges ... the OSHAs could be more heavy handed if they wanted to be, as long as it was clear to these orgs they weren&#x27;t just trying to shut down ranges.  And there&#x27;s funding to be had for ranges (add &quot;fund&quot; or &quot;funding&quot; to the prior search).",1413637437

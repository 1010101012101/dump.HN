In other words, how many dollars were spent as a capital expenditure on the infrastructure, and how many VMs was it designed to run concurrently?<p>I imagine the answers will vary from $10/VM (VM not consuming much of any CPU/disk/network resource, just RAM) to $1000/VM.",1313463532
2889644,comment,2886930,2889490,1,0,yonran,,,"I should have elaborated further. I keep seeing the GP's implication that it's hypocritical of Warren Buffet to suggest changes to the rules when he has already won a lot of money. I think this argument is a red herring, and the reason that it comes up so often is that he is in an enviable position as the ""winner"" of the game.<p>It's perfectly legitimate to advocate for changes to the rules of a game even while playing under the current rules. By way of analogy, a friend wanted to win an honorable mention on some website for his work, but he was annoyed that the last step in judging submissions was a stupid online survey with no restriction on multiple submissions. He emailed the organizers to tell them that the form was meaningless, but when they didn't change the form, he used curl a few thousand times to win. (The runner-up also clearly voted far more than was possible by hand). Optimizing for broken rules can be unfortunate but not necessarily unethical.<p>I just think Mr. Buffet's policy recommendations should be debated on its real flaws (like the article points out) rather than on how well he plays under the current rules.",1313463522

2889625,comment,2889381,2889381,1,0,jamesteow,,,"People on HN/Reddit are pretty biased when it comes to CSS knowledge almost to the point where I really wonder if they've ever worked at a place outside of a startup or a tiny company. If you work at an creative digital agency, chances are the division of labour will mean you won't ever have to touch a line of code. It just makes more sense to divvy up the responsibilities. Plus, during client presentations, most of the designs are mocked up as flats instead of live code.<p>I'm currently using CS5, but it's largely because of some of the small addition features with smart objects, workflow, and layer styles that annoyed me with CS3. It's one of those things where you have to work with a program for a long time before you notice these small upgrades that really help the day-to-day. I think you're fine with CS3.<p>The idea that GIMP is more than useful is... debatable. I would say that every notable designer I know in NYC/SF uses Photoshop. Like it or not, it is the industry standard. And while I do sometimes have a love-hate relationship with the program (specifically because I want more stability instead of new features), GIMP is still far behind with regards to it's intuitiveness and penetration.<p>Now that I've migrated to a startup, I use Photoshop for quick initial concepts before coding scss. Photoshop is pretty solid for making elements or re-using templated elements made from other designers and photo-editing.",1313462921

Looking back, my post comes off as more than a little abrasive, so your consideration is appreciated.<p>I do see where you're coming from (sort of). I recognize that aesthetics can be of substantive value. If that was not the case, artwork would not sell for millions of dollars. That said, I still have to disagree with you regarding Apple. I suspect this may stem from a fundamental divergence in the way we view our computers.<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you view the <i>form</i> of the computer, in addition to the function, as a primary consideration in the value that you assign to it. I, on the other hand, view the <i>function</i> of the machine as the only consideration when assigning a value to it.<p>Computers are different enough from other objects that analogies are always suspect, but a limited analogy to tools may be of use here. I would be willing to trade an ergonomic handle and a certain aesthetic look in a wrench for a 20% gain in torque strength. I suspect that you would not be as sure to make that trade-off. At the very least, you would perhaps consider whether you really <i>needed</i> the advantage in strength.",1313462634

A bunch of ""commodity"" developers wouldn't be able to build a complex real-time system like that and meet those targets - look what happened to the London Stock Exchange a couple of years back when they tried that.<p>It seems much more likely to me that the real underlying driver is the level of customisability they need. They're talking about making scheduler changes to the kernel and building the whole OS themselves - that's a level of control Windows (or any other closed-source option) doesn't offer.",1313462634

They are under no financial pressure (like say a Mexican immigrant) that forces them to take that job.<p><i>Anyway, by that logic...</i><p>I totally agree that it's not the best use of the money, and would definitely rather see it invested wisely.

2889523,comment,2888370,2888370,11,0,grellas,,,"Mature LLCs do have tricky issues when it comes to option grants for employees. Among other things:<p>1. LLCs are partnership-like entities governed by an operating agreement and every owner (member) has to sign and agree to the terms of such agreement, meaning also that every owner (employee) gets to see in intimate detail who owns what within the company, who has what management authority, who has invested what, and the like. Bad for the company.<p>2. LLCs have no counterpart to ISO-like grants, meaning that everyone who exercises options can (normally) effectively do so only at the time of a liquidity event because he would otherwise have to pay an immediate tax on the ""spread"" (difference between exercise price and fair value of equity interest acquired) as of the date of exercise and would thereafter hold an illiquid investment for what could be many years. Bad for the employee.<p>3. Apart from the limitations of LLCs themselves, it becomes difficult to administer an option plan when the value of a company is already high because it costs too much for employees to buy into it. For example, if a company is already worth $10M, the exercise price of options needed to buy .001% of it would be $10K. How many employees want to part with real dollars for the hope of a speculative return way down the road, especially if the company itself says it has no plans to move toward a liquidity event any time soon?<p>Hence, the alternative plan adopted here makes sense. It does <i>not</i> represent any form of true equity interest but is an employee bonus plan. This means you lose the benefits if you leave employment. It also means you get, at best, employee compensation that is subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates as well as to all employment taxes (though no tax is due until the bonus is paid). It also means that the interest is not transferable. It is basically a special reward granted to those who stick it out over the years until the company gets to a liquidity event. It is not perfect but, given the problems noted above, it is actually a pretty good solution to the problem of how to afford special incentives to key employees whom you want to add value to a growing but mature company operating in LLC form.",1313460549

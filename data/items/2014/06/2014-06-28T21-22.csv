The language is inelegant and makes it impossible to express yourself concisely nevertheless the tooling is incredibly good, so good that it makes up for quite a few surprises.<p>A FP IDE that for example shows you inferred types and type errors while you are writing the code, would already help a lot as it could much better visualize the problem, than a compiler that has to describe an error purely with text.<p>FP languages are not perfect, no language is but they have the potential to be much more powerful in lot of ways than imperative languages. Lisp is a good example for this although it&#x27;s also a good example that such power can corrupt people to use macros in awful ways.<p>In any case when it comes to the rhetoric especially from professors, you have to take into account that they have spent their entire life specializing on what they are doing. Of course they are excited by what they are doing and even if they aren&#x27;t they have a good reason to lie to themselves consciously or not because the alternative is acknowledging they wasted their life on bullshit. They are biased and that&#x27;s ok, you just have to be aware of it.",1403992292

Me personally, it&#x27;s gambling, pornography, sulking alone, facebooking acquaintances to see how they&#x27;re doing better than me or worse, checking sports score and living vicariously through the lives of professional athletes on and off the field, checking TechCrunch/Hack News and doing the same with tech billionaires, making up lists and goals alone or with other people that will never come to fruition due to excessive wishful thinking and ambition to overcompensate but fun to preoccupy my mind for the time being. Window-shopping online and offline for the perfect couch, jewelry, fragrance or other consumer goods that is marketed to me. Reading self-help books, attending wellness workshops, &quot;social intelligence&quot; workshops to help me with my awkwardness, tech-meetup&#x27;s to mingle. Wasting money at pubs, lounges and clubs hanging out with friends by shallow association of work, school, social network where nothing of importance is said and egos are stroked and reciprocated.<p>Going home alone. Or accompanying a date back home but feeling alone. Or sleeping int the same bed, wondering how I got here and still feeling alone.

Keeping an overpriced apartment in downtown like a dumb bird nest-building for the sole purpose of mating and trying to fit in.<p>So I have to keep working and running round and round in the hamster-wheel to pay for my student loans, car loan, credit card debt, insurances, save up for a mortgage so I can take on even a bigger loan to convince someone that I may or may not like to start a family with me, so that we can both be indebted for the kids&#x27; college education loans.<p>But still everyday I wake up, and I keep braving it through. Because I&#x27;m hoping maybe just maybe, I can be like Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs or Bill Gates.

Should she learn R or Python and where is a good place for her to start?<p>--<p>My wife is an economist for the state of Minnesota.  She and her department deal with data on economic growth and unemployment statistics. The mostly rely on SQL to parse their data.<p>She is in the position to introduce a new way of handling statistical computing and took my advice and bought an R book.  The book makes too many assumptions about her background, so it&#x27;s not very helpful.  When we began discussing this, I started to think that Python may be more helpful and more generalized for their needs.<p>Where would be a good place for her to start?  Is R or Python the &quot;correct&quot; way to introduce her to this world of ours and which should she consider if she eventually wants to become the evangelist in her department to get others to adopt it?",1403989309

Most people on the Forbes list are not diversified. If the company the person founded plummets, so does their wealth.<p>I happened to attend high school with the children of Dennis Bakke, who graced the Forbes list for 3 straight years. Shares in AES, the company he started, peaked at ~$68/share in the Fall of 2000. By July of 2002, AES was at $3/share.

The dev who writes a native-code Markdown gem for Rails is going to be surprised at how different the experience of writing a SPI bus driver is.<p>So I don&#x27;t find your argument very compelling. You have to do better than to point at how different an experience it is to code in an environment without object cloning and threats. That argument is almost tautological! You have to show how Javacard Java is fundamentally dissimilar as a language to Java. But almost the entire list of language features you cited here are absent because they don&#x27;t make sense in the Javacard programming environment, not because they&#x27;ve been replaced with some other alien language concept.<p>At any rate: you were wrong to begin with when you scoffed at the idea of Java being used for remote controls, given that small consumer electronics were the original problem domain for the language that became Java, and you&#x27;re wrong today, given that there are relatively popular and very successful small-form-factor embedded environments based on Java.",1403989243

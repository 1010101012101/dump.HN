Sorry about that.<p>One disagreement I have is Lisp is definitely not designed for high performance.  Any competent C programmer would find the suggestion laughable.  There&#x27;s a write up for Orbitz somewhere that details many of the problems they had with basic stuff.<p>Second, less syntax just means messier code. Parentheses everywhere doesn&#x27;t make a language good. Just harder to read.  The &quot;macro system&quot; which refers to the ability to perform arbitrary functions on arbitrary data, is not unique to lisp.  And in general, usually obfuscates code and makes debugging harder.<p>Code is data and data is code everywhere(it&#x27;s all just bits and bytes after all).  I would classify &quot;its homoiconic nature making code and data isomorphic&quot; to mean there&#x27;s less syntax.  Everything that you can do with macro&#x27;s and Lisps&#x27;s homogeneous syntax is achievable with similar constructs in other languages.    The fact that the syntax is &quot;homiconic and data isomorphic&quot; is elegant, but in practice just confusing imo.  Programming languages where data and functions are delineated by design have clearer structure and organization.  Additionally they allow the compiler or interpreter to optimize by design.  In the rare case it&#x27;s useful to have a function become a data argument, there are usually accommodations in the language to do so.<p>These are just my opinions though man. You keep on using whatever programming language makes you happy.",1421638440

Some services are cheaper, though not if you are &quot;too rural,&quot; so the rest of what I write here will apply more to suburbia and semi-rural areas and not the truly &quot;out there&quot; rural places (where few people live anyway).<p>There are problems with living outside major cities, though.  Work is often harder to come by, and pays less too.  Companies justify this by saying the cost of living is lower, but this only makes sense for the fraction of your income you actually spend while living there.  If you move out later to a more expensive area, you&#x27;re in trouble because you were being paid at the &quot;low cost of living&quot; rate all along.  On the other hand if you spend everything you earn (or more), having a low cost of living is good.<p>A second problem is much more acute in the UK than the US: cost of transportation.  Gas, cars, and regional trains are somewhat affordable in the US, whereas in the UK they are quite a bit more expensive.  National Rail fares have increased faster than inflation in many recent years, resulting in protests just two weeks ago [1].  For example, an annual pass from Tring to London, which takes 1&#x27;15&quot;, now costs about 6000 USD.  That&#x27;s a significant reason why living way outside London is not that cheap despite the inconvenience.",1421637181

Except it was too slow, so they added the &quot;FastPath&quot; interface, which fixed the speed but made it impossible to safely unload or stack drivers.

The author is focused on one specific feature, which is nice but excludes the entire shutdown process and booting up until the Windows logo appears. Anyone who&#x27;s run a server knows that just the BIOS initialization is often much longer than 10 seconds. And, of course, many services take a noticeable amount of time to startup so time-to-available is longer than time-to-login-screen.<p>Worse, the conversation was actually about the time needed to install updates. Now that Windows logs out before installing updates, you have a fairly sizable time delay – tens of minutes after a large update even on an SSD – while the service is unavailable but before the system starts rebooting.<p>How does Fast Boot work? Well, it&#x27;s actually not booting at all – it&#x27;s logging out all active users and hibernating:<p><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/08/delivering-fast-boot-times-in-windows-8.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/08/delivering-fas...</a><p>That&#x27;s a really nice bit of work in normal usage but it means that you have to do the standard cold boot process when you&#x27;re getting a system update.

To me, recursive generators with &quot;yield&quot; and &quot;yield from&quot; expressions are the most natural way to express iterative algorithms.<p>The Ranges proposal for C++17 is great for <i>consuming</i> generic algorithms, but it&#x27;s far behind generators for <i>creating</i> generic algorithms.  Simple example: try to write an iterator for a tree that doesn&#x27;t have parent pointers. With ranges or iterators, you must maintain a stack as a data member. With recursive generators, the variables on the stack are captured implicitly in the language.  I only know a little about compilers, but it seems like a compiler with syntax tree knowledge of the entire program should be able to optimize generators into machine code that&#x27;s just as good as iterators - i.e. not copying all the caller-save registers onto the stack every time a generator recurses.<p>I think generator syntax is truly a killer feature for any kind of serious algorithmic work.  C++11 made it a lot easier to write and use generic algorithms, but writing iterators is still a big task that reluctant C++ programmers avoid. IMO, fear (and actual difficulty) of writing iterators is the main reason most people don&#x27;t enjoy C++.  If C++ had shipped with generators from the beginning, I think the programming language landscape would be very different today.<p>Nim seems to have a small community and limited promotion, so I do not feel especially hopeful that it will compete with C++ at the same level as Rust.  (I am not sure if Rust will upset C++ in any significant way either!) Perhaps a well curated set of Nim/Rust/C++ comparisons could convince the C++ standards committee or the Rust team to add generator syntax.",1430428811

Microsoft has been struggling with improving Visual Studio and Dotnet, so in open sourcing them or parts of them in CoreCLR, Visual Studio Core, and then GDB/LLDB they are letting open source developers participate in improving them.<p>Sure it isn&#x27;t the full version of Visual Studio, I don&#x27;t expect Microsoft to give away everything but small parts of it.

So they can use good passwords.<p>The username/password pattern is bad, and social login buttons, however much you think they mar your precious login page with confusing options, goes a long way to improving matters.<p>On the other hand, when their control freak CEO flipped out about 2 extra buttons, I wonder what they did with accounts that were already using the system.  I guess send them a random password next time.",1351979963

That I buy, it's a small segment of the population but it does exist.<p>However I'm seriously skeptical that anyone would actually choose an Android tablet instead of an iPad because of this particular incident. It's a ridiculous prospect, and indicative of a consumer that has no real preferences about the device they buy, they're just running purely on spite.<p>GP basically just came right out and said that.<p>> If someone states something about themselves then your best bet is to believe they know better than you what made them decide.<p>I'm not allowed to apply critical thinking skills to statements others make about themselves? That's pretty ridiculous. And since when did I argue against that? I'm sure he does know his motivations better than I. That doesn't mean for a second that he's being honest with us or himself about those motivations.",1351979960

If i'm building a server out of parts and wiring it up in my closet, that's a server.  If somebody else wires up a server in their closet and rents it out to me, that's a cloud.  The cloud means not having to think about things like hard drives failing, and keeping hot spares of servers.  So yes, that often means failover clusters but the real point of cloud is that it doesn't matter whether it's a cluster or not - the physical architecture is somebody else's problem.",1351979559

Valgrind <i>interprets</i> your program, and hooks loads, stores, malloc/free, etc. to track memory usage.  ASan is a compiler pass that inserts extra instructions around loads and stores to drive per-address state machines that live in a shadow area of memory.<p>Valgrind is slow (20x-50x for serial programs, more for parallel programs because Valgrind only executes one thread at a time), but can detect reads from uninitialized memory because your program is essentially executing in a VM.  ASan is much faster, especially if the compiler pass can avoid instrumenting some loads/stores based on static analysis, and cannot detect reads from uninitialized memory, but can detect most other kinds of memory areas.<p>They're both thread-safe, so you can use them to debug parallel programs.  As mentioned above, Valgrind is much slower at this, and until recently [1] you would never see most race conditions in multithreaded programs because Valgrind's schedule would run each thread until it yielded voluntarily, rather than pre-empting and time-multiplexing between threads.  In contrast, with ASan all threads are running close to at-speed and simultaneously, so in my case performance was >100x better <i>and</i> I actually saw the race conditions I cared about.<p>Valgrind supports more platforms than ASan (see [2] vs. [3]), and does not require compiler support (so you can use it to debug code from any compiler), but does tend to lag behind new platform features a bit.  For example, until recently it borked if you used the new x86_64 RDTSCP instruction.<p>Mudflap seems similar in concept, but there appear to be issues with the implementation (see ""Known Shortcomings"" at [4])<p>[1] 3.8.0 and on have the --fair-sched=yes option <a href=""http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core.pthreads_perf_sched"" rel=""nofollow"">http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core...</a>

We use the following technologies: VirtualBox, Vagrant, Flask, gunicorn, PostgreSQL, Ganglia, Icinga, Graphite, Cacti, Jenkins, Trac, Git and many other open source packages.<p>We are well-funded and growing quickly so are looking for Python and Erlang engineers to join our team.

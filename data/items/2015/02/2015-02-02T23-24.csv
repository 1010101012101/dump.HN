That is ok - but the problem is that many startups are not removing features (use cases) even after their metrics show that this new feature is not &quot;the thing&quot;.<p>I heard arguments like this:<p>It is wrong to release a user feature and then simply remove it when your testing shows it isn&#x27;t improving any metrics. Users will feel they are being cheated, even though they aren&#x27;t spending a single penny for that feature.<p>My answer to that is: &quot;How much money did you say they paid for this?&quot;",1422921577

8987990,comment,8985625,8987867,0,0,greggyb,,,"Thanks for at least engaging with this instead of downvoting with no response.<p>I would argue that you are putting a negative spin on the analogy, so I&#x27;ll put the corresponding positive spin on it to balance out.<p>For the road crew, we expect them to give us ready access to the places we most want to go. Imagine a highway - we would judge it a poor highway indeed if there were no exits within 10 miles of a large city. Similarly we do not expect the highway crew to give us equal access to some rural area, even though someone might one day build a fine resort out there. We don&#x27;t judge a road by how well it gives access to things not yet built, but how well it gets us to the places we want to go.<p>Using that spin, we should actively encourage ISPs to make paid fast lanes, akin to a tolled expressway, with preferential access to the most common web destinations.<p>I do not agree with that conclusion. What I do think is that focusing on whether or not a company is allowed to perform any sort of rate-limiting ignores the much bigger issue that competition has been historically stifled in the ISP sector. Many (most?) municipalities offered exclusive franchises to cable (television) providers which made competitive entry illegal. Those cable providers are now our locked-in ISPs. If we must have government action, it seems to me that the best course is to allow freer entry into the market - this looks like allowing competitors rights-of-way to lay wire, allowing access to utility poles (based on my recollection the majority are not owned by telecoms - I should be fact checked on that, though), and dissolving any exclusive franchise agreements. Rate-limiting, as I started this entire thread with, is just a red herring.<p>(Final pedantic point - road work is done by a multitude of private firms contracting for the government - it is monopsony not monopoly.)",1422921531

I&#x27;m building out a new engineering team at an established startup in Ed-Tech.  First, a little bit of who we are:<p>TpT is the world&#x27;s first and biggest online open marketplace where teachers buy, sell, and share original educational materials. Our community of over 4 million teachers connects and shares knowledge on the site every day, and has generated almost $150 million in sales of some of the best, original, most creative classroom resources.<p>Now, for you.  Do you love what Github has done for software?  Can you imagine having to write a web server from scratch every time you build a website? Do you love being a developer that&#x27;s standing on the shoulders of giants?  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing for teachers at TpT - creating a culture and marketplace to empower teachers.  Every teacher out there knows what it&#x27;s like to work a full day in the classroom and then work all night putting together lesson plans for the next day.  TpT is where they can find other teachers who&#x27;ve dealt with the same problem and are putting up their crafted resources for sale.<p>I&#x27;m putting together a &#x27;dream team&#x27; so to speak of engineers who will be the core of our NYC team.  The site is currently PHP with NGINX and MySQL on either end.

Companies should be aware of what data they are providing Google when making use of Google services. Google doesn&#x27;t need to have insider information to have a wealth of information about Uber trips: the number of trips, when they most frequently occur, duration and miles covered, what cities are most popular, what are the popular starting and ending points. All of these data can be mined from just watching Uber&#x27;s use of the Google Maps API. It may not be contractually permitted, but the data are there for Google to use.<p>Through a paranoid lens, Google APIs are corporate espionage you sign up for. Since Google is a valuable and entrenched service provider, they can get away with it. What I could see companies doing in return is attempting to obscure their API usage by fabricating requests. For example, Uber could break the correspondence between API requests and trips by sending requests that look authentic but don&#x27;t correspond to any actual trips. This kind of corporate information warfare sounds like something out of a William Gibson novel, but it certainly feels present and real when you look at Google&#x27;s relationships.",1422921225

Everything Apple comes up with goes into making their product better, and they will fight with every tool they have to make the iPhone the better smart phone.<p>Every time Google comes up with a high quality product (Google Now, Inbox, Maps), they do everything they can to ship it on iOS as well as Android. If it wasn&#x27;t for Apple, Google Now & Maps would be just as good on iOS as on Android. Google doesn&#x27;t use their cloud service advantages as a weapon to make Android better than iOS.

Two key studies known as the Children’s Amalgam Trials are widely cited as evidence of safety. However, four recent reanalyses of one of these trials now suggest harm, particularly to boys with common genetic variants. These and other studies suggest that susceptibility to mercury toxicity differs among individuals based on multiple genes, not all of which have been identified. These studies further suggest that the levels of exposure to mercury vapor from dental amalgams may be unsafe for certain subpopulations. Moreover, a simple comparison of typical exposures versus regulatory safety standards suggests that many people receive unsafe exposures. Chronic mercury toxicity is especially insidious because symptoms are variable and nonspecific, diagnostic tests are often misunderstood, and treatments are speculative at best. Throughout the world, efforts are underway to phase down or eliminate the use of mercury dental amalgam.</i><p><a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10534-013-9700-9/fulltext.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10534-013-9700-9/f...</a>",1422920820

8987886,comment,8985625,8987674,0,0,greggyb,,,"I do absolutely agree with you that ISPs are in a poor state in the majority of the US. I think a lot can be done to improve it. I disagree strongly that net neutrality is the most important or most effective lever to push on.<p>As I have made clear, and as I think is fairly obvious to anyone who has moved between various ISP markets in this country, I believe that the quality of internet service is positively correlated with the number of providers in an area. I have cheap and reliable internet with three ISPs. None of the three throttle their connections in this market, and one has just introduced 10Gbps fiber to the home. The fiber provider is actively expanding, but even if you don&#x27;t live on a street with access, you can get cheap reliable service from either of the remaining two.<p>I think it would be better for any individual in the US who cares about their internet access to move their markets in a direction from one ISP to more ISPs (like the area I live in) than to pass a law enforcing net neutrality and forbidding any kind of rate-limiting.<p>I do care about ISPs being able to offer me as many types of service as possible, and me being allowed to choose the service I prefer. Again, my general preference is for unlimited internet, but my preferences are bounded by costs. Another hypothetical: Suppose I am willing to pay $15 for internet access, and the only service an ISP is willing to offer at that price is throttled in some way (data cap, certain sites slower, whatever scheme). If you eliminate this as an option, then you have eliminated my access entirely, because $15 is my limit. In this way, marginal customers may be harmed by net neutrality.<p>I am not convinced by the argument that the internet will be ruined if some internet service contracts are rate-limited in some way. The biggest threat to the next (Google|Facebook|Twitter) is not any ISP, but (Google|Facebook|Twitter) existing and having a large network effect for its services. And to be honest I have not seen much more argument beyond this point. Even if I were to accept this argument, I think the pathetic internet connections that some people in the US have (there are people still on dialup and <5Mbps isn&#x27;t that rare in rural areas based on my experience) would provide a bigger impediment to the-next-big-thing reaching all of its potential market than any rate-limiting. Multimedia content, especially, is awful on a slower connection. And no regulation of rate-limiting will do a thing to increase speed and reliability of networks - at absolute best it has 0 effect.<p>Forgive me if this is a misinterpretation, but you seem to jump from my hypothetical of _one_ ISP out of >1 in a market offering _a_ plan that is rate-limited in some way (what if it is just a data limit? This does not favor any portion of the web over another.) to there being no un-rate-limited service contracts available. I find this incredibly unlikely, primarily due to the huge unpopularity of rate-limited plans among a vocal minority of internet users.<p>Finally, I am quite confident that two ISPs fighting for my dollars are more likely to offer me something I want than two ISPs fighting for a favorable interpretation of some regulation.",1422920164

I could be misinterpreting but it sounds like you&#x27;re basically saying that today&#x27;s companies get where they are due to predatory marketing, whereas in the Good Old Days everybody just worked hard and did their best and competed solely on quality and price.<p>That may be an unfairly reductive paraphrasing of your point though. I do think it&#x27;s fair to say that nowadays marketers have far more different ways to reach people, and they have to be far more nuanced (or sneaky, if you prefer) in their messaging. I think the latter is due to it being much harder to outright lie to consumers, for legal reasons but also because there are many more ways for those consumers to discover and publicize sleazy advertising claims. 100 years ago cigarette companies advertised that you needed to become a smoker because it&#x27;s healthy for you (they had nothing to back that up with, and plenty of evidence to the contrary). Those were the Good Old Days that you&#x27;re fondly remembering here. Companies lied through their teeth about their products and each other. Marketers still lie, of course, they just can&#x27;t be quite so blatant about it.  But just because this is true doesn&#x27;t mean that things are worse now than they were before.<p>I also wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to blame people doing things you don&#x27;t approve of (like taking crappy loans or buying expensive phones as status symbols) as being the result of an evil marketer exploiting a helpless prole. Actual predatory marketing is something that needs to be monitored and regulated, but there is also no shortage of people with lousy values who continually make terrible life choices. There probably always will be. Take away all marketing (not just the blatantly predatory kind, but also the lifestyle marketing that it sounds like you also consider evil), and many of those same people would simply be finding other activities to engage in that you would also not approve of.<p>Ultimately, who are we to say that some idiot spending way too much money for a status symbol he doesn&#x27;t need should be prevented from spending his money however he wants? It&#x27;s a very slippery slope to go down.

We might find uses for doing that, if those resources weren&#x27;t relatively scarce.<p>If you give an <i>average</i> consumer a 10tb hard drive, will they use it all? Probably not even close. The amount of storage wasted by consumers is beyond epic, thrown away with the next system upgrade (someone want to count how much storage America has thrown away in the last decade?). That&#x27;s the bandwidth context. We can keep boosting the amount of bandwidth for an exceptionally long time, at little additional cost over what the present infrastructure cost. You can go from 100mbps to 200mbps while not having to rebuild everything. Try doubling the output of or availability of water or electricity like that.<p>Put another way, bandwidth - like storage or processing power - is a hyper expanding resource; one in which we can even expand just by being clever while using most of the existing infrastructure. Water and electricity are nothing like that.<p>Humans could easily consume all the fresh water on this planet. We can expand storage, bandwidth and processing power to such an extent that we can never saturate the total capacity.

Why don&#x27;t people just vote with their feet and switch to a competitor?<p>Because they are all monopolies.<p>Every cable company in every city I&#x27;ve lived in the USA has been a locally granted monopoly with the city extracting massive amounts of money from the monthly cable bill in &quot;Franchise&quot; fees.<p>Every provider of POTS service to your houses and apartments is a regulated monopoly.  And while they have to let DSL companies access the lines and long distance competition, the barriers to entry are still there, and the level of regulation is stifling making it hard to compete.<p>Every wireless carrier is a monopoly-- because they all have monopoly powers over bands of spectrum the federal government sold to them.  And while multiple bands were sold, only 3 max bands were sold for mobile in any metro area, reducing competition. (The government claimed that they had to reduce competition to boost the prices that the spectrum sold for-- probably true-- monopolies are very valuable!)<p>So, in response, these companies engage in rent seeking, to cover the massive taxes they pay to the federal government but also to maximize the value of the monopoly they paid so much to establish.<p>And as a result, people get mad at this rent seeking and demand net neutrality.<p>And what do they propose as a solution?  Regulation!  Treat it like a utility!<p>Well, I worked in the electric industry. Another utility that is highly regulated, engages in rent seeking and is, a monopoly over its area.<p>People pay way too much for electricity in this country as a result.  And we have a poor service level-- like the brownouts in California a decade ago that were created when regulations made it illegal to both make and sell electricity, literally prohibiting the provisioning of additional supply. (which naturally the left decided to characterize as &quot;de-regualtion&quot;.

The US declares Iran an enemy and seeks a worldwide ban on arms import to Iran.  The US sends Donald Rumsfeld to Iraq and begins arming Saddam Hussein to fight Iran and the Kurds. When a Kurdish uprising occurs in the north, the US lifts sanctions against Iraq and sends helicopters to Iraq so Hussein can gas the Kurds.  The US continues to arm Hussein after gassing the Kurds.  Decades later, the US sanctimoniously uses this as one of the reasons to invade Iraq.  Then Reagan begins secretly and illegally arming Iran, so as to fund another illegal and secret war against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.<p>* One of the major issues in Middle East nuclear proliferation is that Israel is a nuclear power in the region.  All calls from Iran and other Middle East countries to address this in a broad peace plan or anti-proliferation plan are rejected by the US.  The &quot;only democracy in the Middle East&quot; (which controls the West Bank but &quot;democratically&quot; forbids Palestinians there a vote in the Knesset, although some Russian Jew just off an airplane can move to a West Bank settlement and vote) is de facto a nuclear power and the US declares it can be and Iran and other Middle East countries can&#x27;t be.<p>So it is hard for me to shed a tear that the US can&#x27;t persecute its own press for reporting on its hypocritical, sanctimonious attitude towards Iran.",1422918708

You can make as many ideological statements as you like; they have no bearing on how corporate taxation works in reality.<p><i>It is only tax evasion if the code is explicit enough to rule it out as allowable behavior...a feat of endurance for tax authorities. Even then, many legal tax avoidance behaviors would be non-existent or drastically less common if it weren&#x27;t for corporate taxation.</i><p>The tax code includes provisions allowing enforcement authorities (generally, the IRS) to take the &quot;spirit&quot; of the law into account when evaluating a transaction, structure, or tax return.  This means that something can be completely kosher under the letter of the law but still be treated as tax evasion if it violates the spirit of the law.  The 90&#x27;s off shore tax shelters are probably the most notorious example of these.  Nearly all tax evasion schemes are centered around <i>individual</i> taxpayers.  Not many people are willing to put their own necks on the line to facilitate widespread corporate tax evasion.  (And indeed, individual non-compliance is estimated to be more than 4x the size of corporate non-compliance in the US as a matter of unpaid tax liabilities.)<p><i>If your corporate lunchroom is subsidized (extremely common in mid to large size corporations), it is likely because that subsidy is tax deductible, whereas an individual purchasing their own lunch is not.</i>*<p>Companies absolutely do not subsidize lunches or healthcare for the tax savings that accrue to the employees.  They do so because because such subsidies are financially beneficial from a business perspective (i.e., employee recruiting/retention).<p><i>Compliance and enforcement costs are roughly proportional to the cartesian product of the complexity of the rules and the number of entities.</i><p>Definitely not true.  Compliance costs are roughly logarithmic.  Scale increases disproportionately at mid-size companies but once you approach multinational status the increase in the number of entities results in significantly less than a linear increase in costs. The advantage of scale is a primary factor in the structure of accounting firms.<p><i>Sure, pushing taxes onto shareholders increases the number of entities, but drastically reduces the number of rules, due to the fact that personal income tax is not a profit tax.</i><p>Hahahahaha.  Pushing taxes onto shareholders <i>increases</i> the number of rules.  You see a reduction in <i>statutory</i> laws but a vast increase in <i>non-statutory</i> rules (i.e., court cases and administrative decisions).  It&#x27;s very easy to keep track of statutory law; it&#x27;s relative a nightmare to track non-statutory rules.<p><i>The corporate tax has to have millions of rules and exceptions to rules because businesses are drastically different and legitimate expenses for one business may be illegitimate for another.</i><p>This is not how the tax code actually works.  A business expense is generally deductible regardless of the industry if the expense is legitimately related to a business need of the enterprise.  Very few business expenses are not legitimate, though due to exceptional levels of fraud and abuse &quot;meals and entertainment&quot; and employee vacation expenses (i.e., paid holidays or vacation time) are usually not fully deductible by a business.<p><i>I totally understand that there are way more shareholders than there are companies, but the difference in the number of rules between corporate taxes and and the marginal increase in rules on personal income taxes easily makes up the difference.</i><p>Nope.  Scale matters.  It&#x27;s easier and more efficient for the corporation to determine its tax liability than it is for an individual, and the corporation has greater resources to do so.  You trade having a few thousand taxpayers spending an average of 10-1000 hours dealing with compliance with many millions of taxpayers spending 10-100 hours dealing with compliance.

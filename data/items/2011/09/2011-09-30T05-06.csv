I'm asking the grandparent poster for specifics of how s/he intends a reboot of the entire financial sector because I think this is actually a rather hard problem. I have been through a real estate bubble followed by a recession before (in the UK, at the same time as the Swedish one). I think there are some definite upsides to the Swedish approach, but the people who keep bringing it up seem to overlook the fact that Sweden is a) small - <10 million people, not much more than NYC and b) one of the highest-taxed economies in the world, with tax revenues equal to almost 50% of GDP, and c) is regulated out the yin-yang. The idea that we can just lift one bit of regulatory policy from there, apply it to our financial sector, and call our problem solved is not just misguided, it's flat-out magical thinking.",1317362039

The Livejournal version of this rant would have been: ""I hate how the world is so complicated, with relationships and stuff and politics and law and technology, why don't people in this time just behave simple. Animals have done so for millions of years, and the only thing that matters is that things are simple and understandable to me. I don't care about history and mathematics why, ohhh why doesn't the world simply do what  I want !!!""<p><i>Software needs to be complicated because the tasks that it performs are complicated</i>. The only way human programmers can deal with this is abstraction on abstraction on abstraction. This will only becomes worse as software handles more ""real world"" things such as formerly hardware tasks.<p>Unnecessary software complexity <i>is</i> added due to maintenance, where the maintainers added extra complexity because they weren't able to integrate the changes into the current design and/or didn't understand it well enough. Probably a better job could be done with better tools/documentation in this case. Not by ranting at developers though.<p>His rant about UNIX is crazy.

Chase has not been as bad as Bank of America for me, so I've decided to stick with them.  It's cool to have your bank in lots of places while traveling. \n     I thought about a couple credit unions in my area, but they both close at 5pm on Fridays and are not open on weekends.  They are also far from where I work, so it would be hard to get there during lunch hour.  If one of them were open just a few hours on Saturday, I would probably go for a credit union.  But it's just too inconvenient.  Chase stays open until 6pm, so it's easy to drop by after work, and they are open on Saturdays.\n     The thing I hate about Chase is that my Savings was free until it dropped below $500 (I think), now there is a monthly fee, even though I've had over $500 for a long time now.  When I ask how to get back to free savings, they try to steer me to automatic transfers to activate fee-less savings.  I can't get a straight yes or no out of them if there is any other way.  They are like stepford wives, programmed to only talk about automatic transfers.  Do they get fired if they say a simple ""yes"" or ""no""?  Is that really so difficult?</code></pre>",1317361892

Their design is such that it is thinner in the center and thick at the edges. This design ensures that no matter in whatever position your sleep in your head and spinal column is kept in a straight line. This gives a clear passage to the air ways and helps you sleep better.
Not only an anti snore pillow helps you sleep without snoring it also relieves you of neck and shoulder pain. Sleeping on an anti-snore pillow means that not only you wake up refreshed in the morning, ready for a days work but lets your partner also sleep in peace. Therefore, you get to avoid the problem of sleep disorder, diabetes, heart trouble, blood pressure that usually accompanies snoring.",1317361506

3055765,comment,3055154,3055638,1,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"Indeed. Lisp is a simple language that can be completely defined in half a page. A naive implementation takes less than a thousand lines of code. The language is homoiconic, i.e, there's no difference between programs and data -- everything is a list. This enables programmers to perform complex transformations on code using macros. Lisp compilers such as SBCL generate code that is almost as fast as C++. Oh, and the original Lisp as described by McCarthy is strictly rooted in mathematics. If you limit yourself to writing only a subset of Common Lisp/Scheme -- one that emphasizes immutability and recursive functions on lists of symbols -- it is possible to use formal methods to prove the correctness of your code.<p>None of that is true for JS.

But I'm using the word differently in my presentation: I'm using it to refer to activities that you (as an adult) pursue casually, as a way to relax or enjoy yourself. If you play the guitar very well, for instance, you might take an hour in the evening to just ""play"", singing along, etc. This serves many purposes, and is definitely valuable, well-spent time, but it does not serve to improve your guitar playing. To accomplish that, you'd need to spend some time working on guitar techniques that you are less accomplished at.<p>You can see my problem, hopefully.

That is not to be debated.<p>Even though China&#x27;s economy has overtaken the US in scale, there is one MAJOR issue that is commonly overlooked when contemplating the possibility of them becoming the go-to global currency... They are still an authoritarian state that controls and manipulates the free flow of information in-and-out of its borders. Baidu, Tencent, Weibo, and Alibaba are all still clones of basic US internet infrastructure. Until there is a great lifting of restrictions on the flow of information inside of China, I don&#x27;t see them building the next Google anytime soon. (Baidu does have Andrew Ng doing some cool stuff in Deep Learning tough!)<p>I&#x27;m not trying to say there isn&#x27;t innovation coming out of China, just that there won&#x27;t be a technological renaissance to the likes of Silicon Valley until people can communicate more openly online about potentially dangerous ideas.<p>Can the RMB survive and increase its power with constant tension with HK and Taiwan over political ideology? I&#x27;m not sure... If the Chinese can slowly open up its internal lines of communication without massive protests or radical power struggles, they will be unstoppable.<p>The only question left in my mind is when given the choice to purchase technical infrastructure from the likes of Google/Facebook or Baiudu, what are developing markets (SEA, Africa..) going to pick. Chinese tech companies ideals might be more inline with rapidly developing companies than the old guard in SV..",1423684747

  so years is the anger directed towards people who choose

</code></pre>
I think there is serious merit to that sentiment. Others in this thread have made very keen observations on this all pervasive national attitude that has blanketed America in the past decade or two.<p><pre><code>  however the biggest issue facing the US is this message that excelling
  isn&#x27;t to aspired too, acceptance of who you are and who someone else 
  is is all that matters. It is a self defeating mindset. Don&#x27;t worry if
  you fail, you had no choice, you just can&#x27;t do better. Here let us 
  take care of you....
</code></pre>
And fully expecting to be flamed, I give you perhaps, the most lucid and no-nonsense explanation of how this kind of self-defeatist thinking has come about envelope the national psyche, in the form on a nice quip by none other than, Peter Thiel himself:<p><pre><code>  The countercultural in the &#x27;60s was the hippies. You know, we landed
  on the moon in July of 1969. Woodstock started three weeks later, and
  with the benefit of hindsight, that’s when progress ended, and the 
  hippies took over the country.
</code></pre>
He adds:<p><pre><code>  Today the counterculture is to believe in science and technology. You
  know, our society, the dominant culture doesn’t like science. It
  doesn’t like technology. You just look at the science-fiction movies
  that come out of Hollywood — Terminator, Matrix, Avatar, Elysium. I
  watched the Gravity movie the other day. It’s like you would never
  want to go into outer space. You would just want to be back on some
  muddy island. And so I think we’re in a world where actually believing
  that a better future is possible that you can have agency and work
  towards a better future, that is actually radically countercultural.

9035237,comment,9033845,9033845,0,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"Thank you to grinich for posting a readable link.<p>I have great hopes for In-Situ Resource Utilization and building industrial capability in space, because I think that it has two-fold answers for the primary problem faced by the space industry right now: doing something about the money problem. In short, nobody in government is interested in spending Apollo-scale dollars on space anytime in the near future.  Sure, they might like to have people <i>think</i> that a big plan for Mars is in the offing, but when it comes to actually spending the money, it&#x27;s just not happening.<p>ISRU answers this on two fronts. First, it allows you to do a lot more with less, by spending less on putting expensive mass into space.  Second, when taken to its conclusion, it provides for the real missing link: a return on investment from space which is not just information.  Informational returns from space can be easily met through smaller, cheaper, better probes and satellites, and thus don&#x27;t need an industry in space. They also don&#x27;t require us to have a growing space industry here on Earth either.<p>The debate about humans vs robots in space is driven just as much by concerns about a shrinking/stagnating industry as it is by dreams of a Jetsons future. Industrial returns from space could provide a growing demand, which informational returns do not currently provide. Note when I say &#x27;industrial returns&#x27; that does not mean shipping chairs and tables made of moon dust to Earth; rather I&#x27;m thinking in the sense that if I spent to build a factory in Bulgaria, the return to me is that now I own a factory in Bulgaria and can benefit from being able to own a portion of the production in Bulgaria- I don&#x27;t expect the return to me to be the actual factory output shipped back to my door. Without some kind of demand (in the economic sense) from space, you can&#x27;t even pay the teleoperators back here on Earth, even if you already had a telefactory built up there right now.<p>Two weeks ago, I happen to have toured the Swampworks (modeled on the famous Lockheed Skunk Works) at KSC where the dirt work happens. It&#x27;s a cool place with cool and quirky people. I also have a few grad school connections with people responsible for this work. The robots they have are very cool. They are doing Good Work.<p>However, I know that it is NASA&#x27;s pattern to make really cool plans (up to the point of demo hardware) which then get shot down for budget reasons before it comes time to launch them. I&#x27;d hate to see this happen to them.  It doesn&#x27;t always happen. But it happens often enough that startups can look like less of a risk than depending upon Congress. I&#x27;d love to see them do two things: 1) drop that seed factory to a sub-$100 million cost so that it could be done as a risky private venture instead of a risky government venture and 2)do an on-Earth seed factory construction project to demo the process.  I realize that would be a more expensive project than the work they are doing now, but I think that it would go a lot farther.",1423684161

We’ve had an environment that encourages investment, welcomes immigrants, rewards risk-taking, hard work [2], and radical thinking, and minimizes impediments to doing new things.  Unfortunately we’ve moved somewhat away from this.  Our best hope, by far, is to find a way to return to it quickly.   Although the changes required to become more competitive will likely be painful, and probably even produce a short-term economic headwind, they are critical to do.<p>On a high level I agree with this. The question is what&#x27;s happened to cause growth to slow? The answer to this provides a prescription for what to do, but it&#x27;s also a highly contentious and political question.<p>Here&#x27;s a few suggestions, which will appeal to people of various political views. They&#x27;re all true and all false to some degree.<p>1) Regulation has crept in to stifle innovation. It costs billions to test a new drug, so only a few firms can do it, and those firms will try to be really careful before spending any money. There&#x27;s loads of rules no matter what sector of the economy you look at. Tax is a whole can of worms inside of this rubric. We want to have public services, but we also want people to have incentive to work.<p>2) Near-monopolies have taken over the economy. (You can tie this to regulation, of course.) You can work for one, or buy services from one, but they&#x27;re so powerful few people would want to compete. As technology still inches ahead, a new one is up for grabs now and again (Operating System, Search, Social Network...) but this isn&#x27;t all that great either. What happens to all those entrepreneurs and employees who aren&#x27;t working for the next big ticket? What if the economy had real competition, with lots of little companies providing similar services?<p>3) Capital can move to where it makes the highest return. Labor can&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t mind moving to the US, where I have lots of family, and there&#x27;s work in both the fields I&#x27;m interested in (finance and startups). But I can&#x27;t get a visa, apparently (been told not to bother). Plenty of people currently in the US can&#x27;t really leave, even if their industries are leaving.<p>4) Perhaps China is just doing a Solow. They&#x27;re behind, so their growth rate is higher. When they get closer (per capita) perhaps they will hit a wall like Japan. Not long ago everyone was lauding the Japanese model, now we think lifetime employment in large corporations is part of the problem. The danger of this explanation is it doesn&#x27;t really spur on a lot of introspection.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s a bit disorganised, apologies for that. But those are just some things to think about in the debate.",1423683519

This happens in javascript and is probably much faster than you think.<p>However, when an app grows large enough, this can be a source of performance issues, which is why React provides ways you can inform it about work it shouldn&#x27;t have to do, namely shouldComponentUpdate.

Due to the leveraged debt financing of RE, the reality is often that price appreciation is a <i>multiple</i> of wage appreciation.<p>This takes pretty much all the surplus capital in a region -- among everyone but the rich -- and locks it up in an inert asset.<p>Think of it this way: a starter home in the Bay Area is about a million dollars. In SoCal -- not cheap by any means -- it&#x27;s more like $400k. The average AngelList seed round is $400-$600k. So <i>every single house in the Bay Area locks up the capital required to seed fund at least one new venture</i>.<p>What could all those smart people in the Bay Area be doing if all their capital were not locked up by an inert asset?<p>What&#x27;s worse is that there are idiots who cheer this on because it will supposedly exclude people they don&#x27;t like (the poor, blacks, etc.) from their neighborhoods. I read a great book called Detroit: A Biography. It explained how RE hustlers used racism to fleece people: first they&#x27;d sell a neighborhood to white folks. Then they&#x27;d <i>pay black people to walk around in it.</i> Then they&#x27;d scare the white folks into selling below market, jack the price back up and sell it to blacks, and meanwhile sell a further-out more expensive neighborhood to those same white folks. Rinse and repeat. I suppose if you harbor these kinds of views it&#x27;s kind of poetic when they&#x27;re turned around and used to con you, but it harms everyone else too.<p>I was hoping the housing bubble crash would bring relief, but it&#x27;s right back up there. Either the entire economy needs to inflate until RE is reasonable again -- which would give us $8 loaves of bread -- or real estate needs to fall over and burn. We need something like the 2008 housing crash with no recovery-- to unshackle the real economy from the rentier asset economy.",1423682701

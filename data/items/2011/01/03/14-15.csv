These are judged by their customers on their annual or even quarterly returns.

Kent, who is now far more well known as one of the premier experts on secure and trustworthy systems, described how the Internet design could in fact, be designed so that all of the bits delivered from source to destination were encrypted with keys unknown to the intermediate nodes, and we jointly proposed that this be strongly promoted for all users of the Internet. While this proposal was not accepted, because encryption was thought to be too expensive to require for every use, the protocol design of TCP and all other standard protocols have carefully preserved the distinctions needed so that end-to-end encryption can be used. That forces the design to not depend in any way on the content, since encryption means that no one other than the source or destination can possibly understand the meaning of the bits, so the network must be able to do perfectly correct job without knowing same.""",1294065595

2063221,comment,2062752,2062879,0,0,thinkingeric,,,"The premise of RWDWS is flawed by assuming that the secondary market in stocks is 'free'. This book was published in 1973, and after the 'analytic' schemes of the 1960s (and continuing in the 70s), it had obvious appeal. What it did not account for was government manipulation of financial markets through (de)regulation. For example, the Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the expansion of IRA coverage under ERTA in 1981 opened the flood gates to the securities markets and intensified the Ponzi-scheme nature of securities 'investing'. Prior to the publishing of RWDWS, it is reasonable to claim that the stock market was a arena for transferring risk, not pretending to be a savings institution. Something else to bear in mind is that there are little or no real alternatives to 'funds', and this exaggerates the influx of capital into them.  The idealized view of stock and bond trading fails to fully account for the transaction costs, which are largely hidden, and this 'vigorish' makes it a losing game eventually.  The costs associated with funds ('index' or otherwise) are also carefully and skillfully masked, but it is easier to market the diversification arguments. There's a reason that the 'financial industry' is so profitable: <a href=""http://chartingtheeconomy.com/?p=665"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chartingtheeconomy.com/?p=665</a> It's an increasingly elaborate wealth transfer mechanism.",1294065493

(Really, all he wants are blocks so that he can have RSpec, etc.) But he does point out some odd, and some good features of Ruby that are worth attention.<p>Make up your mind, please. ;)<p>His example that:<p><pre><code>    >> x = Proc.new { 5} \n    => #<Proc:0x00000001015f21a0@(irb):1>\n    >> x()\n    NoMethodError: undefined method `x' for main:Object\n    	from (irb):2\n    >> x[]\n    => 5\n    >> x.call\n    => 5\n</code></pre>\nIs also a bit crazy: Proc.[] is an instance method of a Proc that is aliased to Proc.call (crazy as that may be); proc() is a language feature for calling an object's <i>method</i> (a proc isn't a method, it's an object--Proc.call <i>is the method</i>). And before you ask what about a method without an object, understand that they do not exist. There is a global object that receives all methods not associated with an object.<p><pre><code>    >> def x\n    >>   p self\n    >> end\n    => nil\n    >> y = Proc.new { p self }\n    => #<Proc:0x00000001015ecf48@(irb):4>\n    >> x()\n    main\n    => nil\n    >> y.call\n    main\n    => nil\n</code></pre>\nAnd, in case you're confused about why y.call prints ""main"", the Proc's block is technically created within the scope of the calling or parent object. In other words, the block passed to the Proc is created in the main class and then delegated to the Proc instance--therefore when executed it belongs to, and references the scope it was created in: main. (A binding from the Proc itself is neither created, nor passed to the block. If it <i>were</i> the block would return the same Proc inspection from line 4.)<p>And... the reason a ""patch level release"" (his words, not mine) added syntax is because 1.8.7 is a backport of new features from Ruby 1.9 down to Ruby 1.8. I don't claim to like or understand the version numbers, but the patch level is given like ""ruby-1.9.2-p136"" not as the third part of the number itself.<p>/rant<p>Sorry, I should stop here before I lose my whole morning.",1294064202

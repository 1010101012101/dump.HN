Granted, one could argue that those things are required to see a profit on iOS as well, but at least you have a reasonable enough guarantee that the vast majority of people using your app have paid you for it.<p>> Although the general population aren't necessarily aware of this, it has a huge impact on the trend setting enthusiasts and early adopters.<p>In what way is Apple's 30% profit cut having a huge impact on users and what is your source? I don't see how such a developer issue has any relevance to the general public. If you're referring to the control over what users install, I think you're greatly overestimating the technical prowess of the general public and their desire to install custom software on their cell phones. These are things only techies care about, and they are outnumbered by the people who just make phone calls and post to Facebook.<p>> The masses are not that clueless either.

5127195,comment,5125973,5125973,18,0,dworin,,,"Like most things in business, the problem isn't with the policy, it's with management.  If you create a culture that frowns upon employees taking vacation time, it won't matter if you give them unlimited vacation or only two weeks, nobody will take it.  And if you create a culture that values rested, refreshed, happy employees, the total number of days isn't nearly as important.<p>With that said, when unlimited vacation time is implemented well, it can be amazing for both the company and employees for a number of reasons:<p>1)  You don't worry as much about things like sick days or one-off PTO.  Work doesn't always follow a 9-5 schedule, so if you end up working 60 hours in four days, you can just take Friday off - it feels like less of a big deal if you don't have to worry about 'losing a day.'<p>2) Do you need to leave early to make a flight?  Don't worry about entering it into the system, just do it.<p>3) If people are legitimately sick, they won't come to the office and infect everyone out of fear of 'using a sick day.'<p>4) Holidays get a lot easier.  Do you not mind working between Christmas and New Years, but want to take time off for Eid/Rosh Hashanah/Diwali/Festivus/whatever?  All of a sudden it's not a big deal.  It's also great for parents, who don't have to worry as much about child care if their kids have random day off of school.<p>5) You can take a 'big trip' without losing all your days.  The consecutive days, rather than the one-off long weekends, are the bigger issue for a company.  I've actually found it easier to take a long trip when I didn't have to worry about losing all my days.<p>Companies are nervous about this arrangement because they worry employees will abuse it, but again, that's a management issue.  You have unlimited vacation time as long as you are getting your work done.  If you're taking so much time the work isn't getting done, then the issue isn't vacation time, it's a performance problem, the same as if you showed up every day and just played on facebook.<p>Because the management piece of it is so important, there are also things companies can do to make a system like this work better:<p>1) Create a mandatory 'real vacation' by requiring employees to take at least a week off, in a row, once a year.  If employees feel like they can never take time off, they'll get burnt out and you'll lose great people.  If you make a vacation mandatory, people will feel more comfortable taking the time, and the company will reap the rewards of happier, clearer thinking people.  Plus, many people, especially in creative or professional jobs, get inspired when they're able to step away from the day to day for a little bit.<p>2) Make telecommuting easy, so that employees can still check in even if they're not in the office.  Sometimes, people only really need a half day, but don't mind sitting on e-mail in the morning.  Or they have their kids around all day and would love to get the opportunity to talk to some adults.  The important thing here is to be flexible, and make sure that telecommuting doesn't become ""we can make you work wherever, whenever, even on vacation.""<p>3) Have real performance management.  This isn't about annual reviews, it's about managers that provide ongoing, regular feedback about how employees are doing against the company's goals, help them understand when they're falling short, and work non-performers out of the organization.  Top performers will get turned off by anyone abusing the policy, even more than management.",1359348678

5127185,comment,5124476,5125058,7,0,BlackAura,,,"Frankly, complaining that developing for Direct3D requires just the DirectX SDK, and that developing for OpenGL requires some combination of other libraries is a stupid complaint. It's the kind of complaint that only complete newbies might have - anyone with any idea about what they're doing will not have a problem with it.<p>Not that it's hard, anyway. You don't need any actual libraries to use OpenGL. You just need up-to-date headers, and a way to link to the system's OpenGL library. The easiest way to get those is to use an extension loading library, which provides those headers, links to OpenGL at run-time (same thing that Direct3D does) and makes all of the available extensions available automatically.<p>Complaining about libraries like GLUT, GLFW, or SDL is completely irrelevant. If you were using Direct3D, you'd be writing windowing code directly on top of the Win32 API, which you can still do with OpenGL. If you want to use one of these libraries to handle the platform-specific windowing and OpenGL setup, you can. You don't have to - even in portable games, you can still just write your own platform-specific windowing and OpenGL setup code.<p>So the development setup and libraries are different. So what? It's fairly simple to work out for anyone but a complete beginner. On platforms like iOS or Mac OS X, OpenGL is actually trivial - everything you need is included in the platform's SDK. Same with Android. Same, to an extent, with Linux. OpenGL is only really awkward on Windows, and you can guess who's to blame for that.<p>But there are plenty of legitimate complaints about OpenGL.<p>The API is much more complex than Direct3D. There are dozens of ways to do things, with no way to tell which is the best way (short of looking at what Direct3D is doing, and copying that). Behaviour and performance is inconsistent between driver vendors, versions of driver from the same vendor, and across platforms. Some OpenGL drivers (Intel's on Windows, until very recently) are effectively unusable, or don't expose all of the hardware's functionality that Direct3D does. There are lots of legacy issues to carefully creep around, and they can still bite you even if you're not using the legacy features. The shader compilers aren't consistent between different vendors, and are often incredibly slow. Linking shaders is kind of clumsy. Since the API and drivers are much more complex, it's more common to run into severe performance issues caused by the driver than it is with Direct3D (and consoles are better than Direct3D in this regard, because their graphics drivers are so thin that they essentially don't exist).<p>Even picking a decent subset of OpenGL to use is a pain. Do you use OpenGL 2.x and ignore large chunks of it to get a reasonable API, and broad support? Do you go for OpenGL 3.x or 4.x instead? Which version? Which set of extensions? It's dead easy for OpenGL ES, though - 1.x (fixed function) or 2.x (shaders), neither of which carry around the legacy crap that OpenGL still carries.<p>Dealing with all of that is the problem with using OpenGL, not working out how to link to it.<p>Oh, and documentation. That really is shocking, mostly because the majority of documentation or guidelines you might find are written for OpenGL 1.x, and are completely obsolete.<p>There are some good beginner-level guides to getting started with modern OpenGL:<p><a href=""http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/</a> (OpenGL 3.3)\n<a href=""http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Table-of-Contents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Tab...</a> (OpenGL 2.0, not using the legacy stuff)",1359348401

Like eBay did, like Quanta did when they challenged LG. It's part of our duty as a good corporate citizen to try to accelerate the rationalization of patent law.</i><p>This guy talks like a crusader for just law instead of an executive or business owner. You'd pretty never hear this from anyone in a public company, it just wouldn't be possible. More's the pity that most people can't really achieve big results like this; we have to retain ownership of our businesses in order to really live out our principles.<p>-<p>A commenter on Ars, on why no one else fought Soverain to the end:<p><i>I think the problem from most defendants' perspective is that they can just pass the costs along to their customers without facing any strategic disadvantage. Compared to its competitors, does Newegg winning this lawsuit give them any competitive advantage? After all, their competitors are no longer subject to paying for the invalidated settlements either.<p>By paying the settlements, the companies reinforce an awful system, but they also don't need to face the volatility and potential cost of a jury-trial in districts cherry-picked by the trolls. By going to trial, the defendant only stands to maintain patent troll cost parity with their competitors (if they win and invalidate their competitors' settlements)- or they lose and get hit with a judgment that could be extremely costly.<p>Further, in most organizations, management risks the ire of their shareholders should they elect to go to trial and lose. They're again put in a situation where their personal risks outweigh any benefits they stand to gain. Even for executives that consider themselves ethical, they can still rationalize that minimizing risk to the shareholders is the ethical decision.</i><p>-<p>This seems true enough - from a (rational) game-theoretic perspective, why should any victim really fight hard to overcome a troll, if in doing so they risk big losses, and don't gain any advantage over their competition <i>even if they win</i>? The main potential upside is that consumers and potential partners will view them more favorably and give them more business (as is happening now), but this is a very unreliable bet to make. The downsides of ""doing the right thing"" are very likely greater than the upsides.<p>The main motivator to fight the trolls has to be personal principle, and even then the principled person has to balance it against the real risks to his company and lifestyle. Newegg had the gumption and muscle to see the case to its end, but it was the lucky one, the one-in-a-hundred with the right attributes (principled owners, private ownership, deep pockets). We're not likely to see this kind of thing happen very often, with the odds stacked against what should be the right outcome.<p>And that's all the more reason to salute Lee Cheng, Fred Chang, and James Wu and their victory against profiteers in a flawed system. CEO Fred Chang probably deserves as many, if not more, accolades as Lee Cheng, for deciding as the major shareholder to take this battle to its end.",1359346528

This of course assumes I have a minimum level of intelligence/work-ethic, a passion for medicine, and there were enough willing doctors going around to fulfill the demand for apprenticeships, but I think it's thusly theoretically possible to do away with college, although it would never happen.",1359346253

Heck, even ID software provided free source of their engines, but didn't give away their WADs. But is the PhP in this case of any value without the rest? Can anything be done with it?<p>If the PhP is of no value on its own and it specific to the CSS, JS, and images, then imo that totally would violate the spirit of GPL'ing the other. If that is the case and you want to have it be proprietary, don't provide the source/files for any of it (for the new stuff). If you want it to be GPL, then sell it, but make all of it free source, including the images, JS, and CSS. Note: I believe that Stallman's view (if you care) is that not providing images is ok if it is art and not source/required for the source, but I think that is a loophole that can be exploited, so I say make it all free.<p>However, if the PhP provides some value on its own and is usable (like one of ID's engines), it's all good and do what you want.<p>There is nothing in GPL that says that you can't get paid for it. Just because you have to provide the source for free doesn't mean people can't pay you for the work, it just means they can't pay you for the source. They could pay you for the bundle (which they could create on their own if they wanted for free, but some may not be savvy enough to do that). GPL is not anti-capitalist.",1359346200

9757641,comment,9755683,9756188,0,0,mcv,,,"The problem with the mismanaged economies isn&#x27;t the bailing out, it&#x27;s that they got such easy loans for such a long time, because the moneylenders thought they&#x27;d get their money back no matter what. If the moneylenders lose money on this, they&#x27;ll probably be a bit more hesitant keeping incompetent and corrupt governments in the saddle.<p>Suggesting that Greece as a whole is single-handedly responsible for this mess is silly. Yes, of course their governments over the past decade and a half were incompetent and corrupt, but it was because of the cheap loans that they could cover up the problems and keep up the appearance to the voters that all was fine. Without that, they&#x27;d have been voted out of office that much sooner. Instead, the easy money left the bad situation to fester for far too long.",1434974389

Many people have bandied about Apple&#x27;s &quot;higher rate&quot; than Spotify, but the difference is likely to be only one hundredth of a cent per stream.  Apple will pay out 71.5% of their $9.99 fee vs the 70% that Spotify does. An extra $0.15 a month per subscriber divided by all streams works out to about one hundredth of a cent per stream difference. So, a popular artist&#x27;s paycheck for millions of plays of their song would be $10,200 vs $10,000 using the typical average streaming payout of a little over 1/2 a cent per play.<p>Plus, there&#x27;s the fact that Apple Music will cannibalize a lot more iTunes sales than Spotify does.",1434974371

(I don&#x27;t agree with your being down-voted, you&#x27;re posting a valid oppinion, just one I happen not to agree with).<p>Apple is offering a 3 month free trial in order to win market share for their service from the established streaming services. Doing that benefits Apple but does not benefits artists.<p>Say I&#x27;m a Spotify subscriber. I cancel my Spotify service and switch to the Apple service. Artists suffer a 3 month gap in revenue during which they&#x27;re not being paid either by Spotify or Apple for my listending to their music. The only people who really benefit are Apple who now get a split of the revenue instead of spotify, and the only people who really lose out are the artists who lost 3 months pay.<p>There&#x27;s no reason artists should have to forgoe revenue in order to benefit Apple in that way.",1434974355

You can stay in school and start your own company. In fact, your school may even have an incubator program to help you.  Being is school is probably one of the best times to start a company since you have free o cheap access to many resources that are expensive outside of school, and you have fallback when your first few ventures fail.<p>With that in mind, I&#x27;m always amused at the subset of programmers who rail against degrees.

This seems like a pain to debug using devtools. I&#x27;d love if the generated classnames could resemble the original classnames, e.g.<p><pre><code>    .my-fantastic-component-24xMw

That&#x27;s it...and that&#x27;s fine. But I cannot stand her disingenuous &quot;won&#x27;t someone think of the children?!&quot; nonsense. It&#x27;s like LeBron James publicly pleading for the NBA to share more of its revenue so that the younger players can be better off in retirement, while leaving out the fact that he&#x27;ll personally take 90% of any incremental revenue.

Many think it is, but the law doesn&#x27;t incriminate the sex-worker, it incriminates the person who lives off of a sex worker or her handler if she has one. In fact, I think there are still establishments authorized by the State that have been up for more than 50 years or something, but those appear to be <i>very</i> drastic in their internal policy stuff.<p>A lot work for themselves. When I was in college, there were many girls who used it as a way to have some fun and some money (college is free, and a lot live in dorms that are also free)).<p>Also, it is not like in the U.S. (movies) in that you won&#x27;t find sex-workers on the streets.<p>This stuff is pretty organized. Happens mostly in night-clubs or in <i>dedicated</i> places that are <i>guarded</i> with security, where you will be thrown out if you cause any problems or are too drunk to behave.<p>They generally have a compound with the club and the hotel inside, convenient if you plan to get wasted as you won&#x27;t have to drive. Just a few yards and you&#x27;re in bed.<p>These compounds offer a sort of &quot;Security as a Service&quot; and the girls &quot;lease&quot; the place (the client pays an additional fee). And many girls will just go from club to club, compound to compound. They have usual taxi-drivers who take them, etc.<p>The biggest hazard would be the fact they won&#x27;t properly put a condom on a man. The usual way would be to put it while he&#x27;s erect, and some need help, so the girls will perform fellatio on a limp phallus with a condom on and the phallus grows into the condom. They also use cheap condoms that are way too tight for anyone older than a 13 year old (crappy 52mm condoms).<p>Also, most of those who do anal don&#x27;t have the proper lubes; so they&#x27;ll have whatever makes it easy and it is often an oil based hair product, or something. They&#x27;re not really aware of how latex reacts to that, etc.<p>And again, some clients are just idiots and want to have protection-free sex at all costs. The girls are reluctant to talk if they have a disease because there&#x27;s a whole procedure and they&#x27;ll lose their job, so they comply, infecting the person.<p>And as for Al Jazeera, is amusing that a Djihadist Channel doesn&#x27;t even cover Qatar. They used to let nut-jobs go on for hours on their waves inviting people world-wide to kill Algerians because we&#x27;re not &quot;Arabs or Muslims&quot;.

Everything else is done via the apps installed on your device.<p>(That&#x27;s, coincidentally, is also why a lot of dream scenarios for beacons can&#x27;t take off - they literally require you to have an Internet connection and a vendor-specific app on your phone to do anything interesting, which is not something you can expect of people outdoors. Facebook has a really good chance of making some of the beacon ideas work, because a/ almost everyone has their app, and b/ it&#x27;s an app that people actually want to use outdoors, and they power up their mobile connection for that.)",1434971996

That said, Webpack works great with Babel indeed, so in practice this becomes:<p>cross-platform ES2015/JSX --(Babel+Webpack)-->  Browser code & Node code<p>The only thing, really, is to stop thinking of webpack as something that turns node code into browser code, but of something that turns general code into platform-specific code.<p>I fully agree that this wasn&#x27;t what webpack was originally designed for, but in practice there&#x27;s nothing about webpack that makes this intrisically difficult. Personally, I just use DefinePlugin to define a boolean SERVER constant. It&#x27;s set to true on the node build and to false on the browser build, and then in my code there&#x27;s just some stuff like this:<p><pre><code>    if(SERVER) {
        // node-only code
    }
</code></pre>
For the browser build, Webpack turns that into this:<p><pre><code>    if (false) {
        // node-only code
    }
</code></pre>
And then UglifyJS removes it entirely.<p>React uses the same trick to differentiate between production and dev builds, so in practice most React+webpack users will already be doing something like this so it&#x27;s not a complex step to add.<p>I manage the difference between test/dev/production builds in the same way, haven&#x27;t yet found a downside.",1434971781

I&#x27;m not yet convinced Webpack is a good idea either -- especially because the documentation is a sketchy mess at this point.<p>Webpack (like browserify) was written to generate bundles for the browser, not modules for Node. I have been wrong in the past and would be willing to suspend my disbelief if I were able to find any reliable information on how you&#x27;re supposed to use Webpack for Node, but right now my gut feeling tells me it&#x27;s a really bad idea and the Node support is a hacky afterthought at best.",1434970896

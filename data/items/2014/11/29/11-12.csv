8673593,comment,8673200,8673501,0,0,tinco,,,"Not to one-up you, just since apparently it&#x27;s worth mentioning, I&#x27;ve been doing webdev for about 9 years, and at least from my perspective backend rendering is definitely going out the window.<p>I started as a Rails dev in 2008, did ASP.Net before that, and last year I&#x27;ve moved from Rails to a pimped up Grape, which is a framework suited more for developing API&#x27;s. Maybe it&#x27;s just the sort of apps I&#x27;m building (basically SaaS) but I don&#x27;t see any backend rendering in my feature, if I&#x27;m building it, it&#x27;s going to be either a SPA, or a static site. (I built my sisters&#x27; band a single page static site, very nice).<p>Latest project is using Polymer, and no Javascript framework at all. I think you&#x27;re right, Angular is extremely ugly, and Ember seems to do too much. But plain Javascript has become very powerful and HTML5+CSS3 reduce the need for UI toolkits.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m crazy, but I don&#x27;t see a super hard need for modules either, I define all dependencies at a single location, and just bind everything to window. The not binding things to window rule is only for library/component developers, if you&#x27;re an app developer you should own window, make it your home and have everything as you expect it to be.<p>Anyway, what I&#x27;m hoping is that new Rails editions focus more on the SPA experience, they have been reluctant to. I use Grape, but I immediately pimped it out with all the niceties Rails has, including ActiveSupport and ActiveRecord, but also a console and decent logging.<p>What I do worry about is the amount of people embracing Node.JS over Ruby. It&#x27;s crazy people would chose Javascript over any language at all in an environment they&#x27;re not absolutely forced to. My fear is one day I&#x27;ll be seeking a job, and all there is is shops building webapps in vanilla Javascript, wouldn&#x27;t that just be a plain horror story?",1417261880

(I just want to talk about it)<p>I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding the need for this, especially because I&#x27;m highly suspicious of building any significant amount of abstraction on top of rails. This is because rails core is fucking insane. Besides the fact that it&#x27;s in a constant state of flux, the amount of dynamic/meta/runtime fuckery that takes place makes it a living nightmare for security (and performance).<p>Rails already provides a highly-specific set of &quot;convention over configuration&quot; settings that work for most users with a basic understanding of HTTP. How exactly does this framework make those settings &quot;better&quot; besides re-arranging the basic set of abstractions that base rails provides (and adding more &quot;fuckery&quot; on top of that)?<p>Who is your target user group? Rails already attracts a significant number of new developers who have never worked with the web before because the abstractions are relatively easy and straightforward to understand. This is what makes rails very impressive and attractive, but, at the same time it locks a whole generation of new web developers into &quot;the rails way&quot; of thinking about the web (and later have to be untaught when they realize performance is actually important).<p>IMO If a &quot;better&quot; ruby web framework was to come into existence, I would encourage it to be more in touch with the basic abstractions that are already built into HTTP (see <a href=""https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt</a>) and not try to over-abstract those basic concepts so that moving among http frameworks (in ruby or other) requires significant domain knowledge.<p>Are there any performance benchmarks? I could see a project like this unintentionally adding 2-3x performance hits (without realizing it) due to the extra abstractions.<p>BTW, what the fuck is up with this book? I assume you want to sell it to me in the future so that I can learn how to &quot;properly&quot; use your brand new open-source framework? What the fuck is wrong with a readme and a wiki, especially if you ever considered larger open-source adoption?

I also offer local computer technical support. Neither of these roles are currently financially sustainable in their current state, and I&#x27;m dipping into my savings to make rent. I work from home, don&#x27;t hold physical stock, and -- crucially -- I&#x27;m not certain that what I&#x27;m doing is the best thing for me and my state of mind. I have struggled with depression and brain wiring problems for the past 6 years and have not yet found an appropriate medication that helps me. Exercise is my drug of choice, and I&#x27;m OK at that; I could be better at it, however. I am not a programmer, though I want to be competent at it for self-satisfaction rather than commercial gain.<p>With this in mind, I&#x27;ve decided to spend the 2014/15 winter months on improving my prospects for the coming year. In the first instance, I want to apply myself better to my `work` hours, and have the results to show for it. I will readily admit that although I can do a bunch of things well, I don&#x27;t excel at one thing; rather, I haven&#x27;t yet found that thing.<p>I want to read more over winter with a view to learning and taking those things into my freelancing career to make 2015 better than 2014.

At that time I was in my first year of college doing Mechanical Engineering which I didn&#x27;t grasp really well. So, I ended up putting all my time into development.<p>The first thing I built was a small website which was a music catalogue. When I think about it now, it seems utterly pathetic but it was the first thing I ever built. Later on, I got into WordPress and spent a lot of my time picking up PHP and writing new themes. This was an enlightening experience as I picked up a lot of plugin writing practices and I ended up being invited to a few WordCamps.<p>In the coming years, I learnt a good deal of JavaScript and was working with PHP frameworks to write a lot of admin interfaces for my own projects and some tools for my college&#x27;s  software development team.<p>In the last one year, I picked up Ruby and wrote a few tiny gems.<p>With this much experience, I have been able to port code from most of the languages I have encountered to all the languages I know.<p>Currently, I work at a company where I write a lot of PHP, SQL queries, a lot of front-end and all of us are expected to be full-stack.<p>My only advice to you would be:<p>1.

When it reaches a character that doesn't match, the matching is terminated.  That means that if you have the regex /^foo$/, ""f"" will take slightly longer to parse than ""b"", since it'll move on to the next character for ""f"", but not ""b"".<p>Due to this, you can produce matching data for a regex in a fairly small number of samples.  Interestingly, it takes fewer samples to reliably get characters further down the string -- however, this may be a result of my horrid statistics code.

So if you asked again - why do we ship Macs with Flash - the answer would be: We shouldn't.

1823044,comment,1822707,1822707,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Print lists of movie and book titles - they have to make a few words do a lot of work. I say lists, because you shouldn't be concerned with what they're about, but with which ones make you curious, and why. Good titles may evoke a strong association that you didn't know was there (horror movie? use a nursery rhyme fragment and you're half-way home), or provoke flights of imagination with juxtapositions you have never considered before. Make notes of which (unfamiliar) titles excite you most. This is why you should print them - so you can't immediately satisfy your curiosity about a provocative title with Amazon or Wikipedia. Do this over several days or with friends, it can be like a game where you compete to imagine what the movies or books are about. Then start making up stories about your domain. If it were a person, what sort of person owuld it be, what job would it do? Who would ube shown using it in a movie, and why? Play with it, have fun, write down anything that makes you smile or laugh. Don't be in a rush, a good name may need days or a week to pop up.<p>There is plenty of room for good two word domains, and will be for a long time to come. There's still a lot of one-word names available too; many of them sound stupid in isolation but it's the product which makes the name in the end. A good name should be easy to remember and repeat to another person, and you achieve that by stimulating an emotional response. If it's also functional/descriptive that is a bonus, but not necessary. You should also allocate some time for doing trademark searches etc. You must go through a lot of names and be patient.<p>I intensely dislike the current wave of domains like 'weeb.ly' 'grobble.com' 'nu-spella.com'. Most of them feel so forced and fake, like in bad science-fiction movies for kids. Unless kids are your target market, don't ask them for suggestions.  You can use a completely made up name (such as anigbrowl) if it feels right, but some feel natural and some feel forced. This often seems to mirror the quality of the product, but maybe I'm just telling myself that.<p>There are many other techniques - dictionaries, letter shuffling, and so on. In fact there are specialist naming companies that will put together hundreds of names and spend hours discussing them, checking against trademark registries etc. Corporations use them all the time. One firm I know will charge a tiny startup $5,000 but they'll make a big corporate client sign up for $250,000. Of course that includes focus groups, international trademark clearances, checking a name doesn't mean something embarrassing in a foreign language etc.",1287825122

You can imagine what happened the following year when I got dial up.<p>_________________________________________<p>I also had a computer hardware class in high school that the teacher would often leave for extended periods of time. The other students and I get enough systems running and scrounged a router so that we could play multiplayer Warcraft II during class (which was an old game even back then). We pulled this off for about a month before we got caught. It turned out the teacher really didn't care anyway.<p>_________________________________________<p>When I lived in rural Mexico, I used to tape pictures of Jesus to the outside of my packages that I sent home so that the shady people in the mail system wouldn't mess with them.<p>_________________________________________<p>My old boss used to add useless revisions every time that I sent him an email saying that part of a project was finished such as ""Change the font up to 12px on that navigation please. What? It's already at 12? Can you make it 12 and a half? No, 13px is way too big but I want it bigger than 12 so just fix it OK?""...yeah, that guy. Anyway, I found that if I sent him emails at the end of the day, he would not read them until the following morning when he had the most emails to respond to. Therefore, sending him finished tasks at the end of the day meant fewer useless revisions. I found that outlook has a ""delay delivery"" setting so as I finished tasks through the day, I would que them to send at about 7:30 at night, when I could be sure that he wasn't working. Lo and behold, the endless revisions went down by about 90% and I got a lot more stuff done.",1287825078

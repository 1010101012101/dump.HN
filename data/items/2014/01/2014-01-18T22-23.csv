7082618,comment,7082307,7082307,3,0,JimmyL,,,"That manager is bad at their job, or has a different set of values than the developer who&#x27;s asking the question. In either case, this is a recipe for a bad relationship.<p>As a manager, I consider my biggest responsibility to be creating and maintain an environment and structure where the developers that work in it (and report to me) are happy, productive, trusting, and engaged. Anything else I&#x27;m responsible for doing - like, say, delivering software - can&#x27;t happen in a sustainable and predictable way without my being good at that first thing. Being a good software manager - or any manager really, but I&#x27;ve got less experience outside of of the software realm - is about people first and whatever-you-do second, and it sounds like this manager has forgotten and/or missed that.<p>What do you do in this situation? Make preparations to quit (which is distinct from actually quitting, but it can lead to that). If you have a decent network - and if you&#x27;re good enough to get a 40% raise on moving jobs, you should - go talk to a few people at other companies you admire. If you&#x27;ve know any recruiters you trust, talk to them. Get a feeling for what the market will actually pay for your skills. Spend some time working though a good answer to &quot;why do you want to leave your current job and come here,&quot; which force you to clearly work out what it is that you don&#x27;t like in your current job (and if moving jobs will fix that).<p>Once you&#x27;ve done all that and still want to leave, go to your old manager (and their manager) with a job offer in hand, and tell them you want a 20% raise and the following four things to change in this specific way, pulling no punches. If they hesitate, put in your notice there and there. If they accept immediately,  book another meeting for a month hence with both of them to re-evaluate how fixing those issues are going, and go back to your job.<p>If you&#x27;re in this position, like Toronto, and can give a brief discourse off the top of your head about when it is and isn&#x27;t appropriate to use a metaclass in Python, respond to this and let&#x27;s talk.",1390085951

The majority of users don&#x27;t want to be notified of too many things and more notices may just be ignored. This is especially true of users with many extensions. As an alternative, it&#x27;s possible to put extensions into a probationary period (I don&#x27;t know if they already do this) when it&#x27;s first created or the ownership has changed.<p>Extensions are reaching the wild-west of Play and no one&#x27;s happy about that except malware/adware authors. If Google continues to serve more free users than their quality capacity (already a problem with every other service they offer), it won&#x27;t be long before people move on.<p>And they will move on. Contrary to what most people believe, no one rules one domain forever. Whether it&#x27;s the big iron of IBM, telecom of Bell, OS of Microsoft or the services of Google.

Well implemented purely functional data structures are usually anywhere from just as fast to about 20x slower. If the imperative version is tree like, the cost for lookups in the functional version is the same, but the cost for updating is a bit higher because a path needs to be copied rather than just 1 node modified in place. For a data structure like an unordered map, you can use a hash table backed by an array for the imperative version, but you&#x27;ll have to use a tree for the purely functional one. This can cause about a 10x-20x slowdown.<p>For example in this post <a href=""http://donsbot.wordpress.com/2009/09/26/very-fast-scalable-mutable-maps-and-hashes-for-haskell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donsbot.wordpress.com/2009/09/26/very-fast-scalable-m...</a> Haskell&#x27;s Data.Map is compared with Judy arrays, and found to be 11x slower.

You won&#x27;t find Richard Branson to fit the &#x27;tech-startup&#x27; mold, but he&#x27;s certainly an entrepreneur. And a pretty good one at that.

The less obvious reason is lack of social mobility; the more obvious reason is the obvious one (ie, they are more worried about keeping a good thing going, than rebuilding a good thing from scratch).<p>This might not be a perfect explanation, but even as a straw man its worth considering that there is some truth in it.<p>[#]  While the wealth and brains exist in europe, the critical-density of (capital, expertise, experimental sandbox) does not.",1390085404

Sure, at any given day, you will accomplish more by working 12 hours than 8. But, over time, you will start accomplishing less <i>per hour</i>, largely without noticing it. And while working longer will still optimize locally, you will actually become significantly <i>less</i> productive overall!<p>This is not a character flaw or anything like that.

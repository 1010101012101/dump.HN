Stallman would like to remove the user's freedom to restrict freedom on hardware -- the hardware analogue of GPL vs. BSD -- but this doesn't work on hardware because copyright doesn't apply, so the best he can do is choose a platform that is merely inconvenient for some proprietary software.<p>Moreover, OLPC continues work on its Linux software, which is still the preferred distribution.  The next wave of Give-One-Get-One machines are shipping with Linux, not Windows.  And if Stallman's MIPS machines ever take off, the best educational Linux distribution for them may well be the OLPC's software, so helping OLPC (or, at least, SugarLabs) is not a waste of time or money.<p>The reason Negroponte is so eager to help Windows onto the device is likely because several countries expressed interest in it, and he wants to boost sales.

So the idea should be to make the system as simple as possible, and make it obvious if things are tampered with.<p>Using a computer system is not very compatible with the basic principles of voting:<p>* Each person gets one vote, and only one vote\n* It must be impossible to figure out what some specific person voted for<p>Computers are good for the first part, given infrastructure to support it (provide each person with a way to identify themselves to the computer - smart card and biometrics maybe). They suck at the second part, though.<p>In Sweden we have a simple system: paper slips with party names printed (or written) on them. You select someone to vote for, put your paper slip in an envelope and drop that in a box after someone checks your identity and ticks you off in a list of voters.<p>After everyone has voted, the box is emptied, the envelopes are opened (checking that each one contains a single vote) and the slips are counted manually. Results are reported to the voting comission (or whatever they're called) who sum the votes and then it's all done. We have the results a few hours after voting is finished.<p>In the US the same system should work well, I don't really understand what the whole voting machine thing is good for. It's not like there's an election every two weeks, computerized voting machines will probably be used maybe two times in their lifetime. A waste of resources!",1225820573
353644,comment,353309,353533,0,0,luckystrike,,,"Sorry, but your examples do not truly reflect the situation out here. (I am not too sure how much time you have spent in India.)<p>My take on why an 'average' Indian kid is a little bit better than an 'average' American kid in math, is just because (s)he has done more of it and with a bit more rigor. Everyone needs to pass a mandatory math exam here (as part of what we call class Xth board exams), and only after doing that one gets a choice to pick a stream of subjects of his/her liking (that may or may not include math).<p>As everywhere, some kids do have trouble liking/understanding math, but they do not have much of an option initially and their parents also keep the ante up, on studies for this particular subject. (Of all the kids who are not able to clear the Xth board exams, the percentage flunking in math is the highest). \nAnother reason that helps getting this subject more priority, is that for most of the better paying professions, it is a must. (Sadly, majors in humanities mostly have more trouble getting in to top earning bracket).<p>A similar example is about learning the English language. Kids in India do it more than kids in China/Japan, and hence do it better on an 'average'.",1225820551

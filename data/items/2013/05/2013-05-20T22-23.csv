I know this through personal experience. If you are just making static websites for small businesses and trying to compete with 1&1, then sure, you're going to have a hard time getting rich. But <i>that's always been the case.</i><p>You will never make a lot of money selling services to people or businesses that are highly price-sensitive or just don't need (or see a need) for a more sophisticated product.  I wasted a lot of time selling services to these types of customers and I can tell you it's a mistake. Choose your customers wisely and go for one's that have money to spend. That type do not want to spend any time splitting hairs to get a shitty product. They want something that is great and will pay handsomely for it. The challenge in that is proving your worth, but as I said before that's always been the case and there's nothing new about that.<p>EDIT: I realize that is a little vague, so let me add some hard numbers. On my first large web dev contract I built a custom website (not incredibly complex) for a guy who had a $250k budget. I met him through the local Chamber of Commerce. I went back-and-forth about how much to charge him for the specs we discussed and in the end went to him with a quote of $15k (quite a lot of money for a single project for me at the time) and his response was something along the lines of ""Okay, that sounds great!""<p>Fuck me for not realizing that I could have charged more.

This was, to say the least, very surprising considering I have very little correspondence with Google Checkout and was actually thinking there was a huge problem with my account. Thankfully not but this is still bad news for myself and I presume the industry at large.<p>Google Checkout was <i>very</i> good with their fraud protection to the point that I did not have to think about it. In fact, over the years I have been growing my business Google have been my rock---never a real issue with them.<p>PayPal was a similar story but it also seemed to attract the sort of customer that would open a dispute at almost any issue (or just threaten it). You can also count me in one of their horror stories that indirectly cost me 5k and even got to the point where they just flat out refused refunds for my customers who wanted them.<p>I have a Stripe and GoCardless account as well and I've been trying to make it work but their fraud protection is just not up to scratch compared to Google and PayPal, which is a real shame. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to see enough data to get quite the same fraud protection. Stripe do look fun though.<p>Another perspective from a merchant: roll on Bitcoin.

Especially BMW has researched alternative fuels, mainly hydrogen, but stopped its test fleet in 2009 [0]. Only one super expensive image car, a BMW 7, remains [1]. Audi and VW also dabbled in alternative energies, but none of them really got into it. Hopefully, Tesla can breath some new live into this area. We live in the 21st century, I demand vehicles fueled by anything other than oil.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/alternative-antriebe-bmw-stellt-wasserstoff-testflotte-ein-a-665549.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/alternative-antriebe-bmw-...</a> (german, Google Translate here: <a href=""http://translate.google.de/translate?hl=de&sl=de&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Fauto%2Faktuell%2Falternative-antriebe-bmw-stellt-wasserstoff-testflotte-ein-a-665549.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://translate.google.de/translate?hl=de&sl=de&tl=...</a>)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Hydrogen_7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Hydrogen_7</a>",1369087322

First, will Tesla be able to manufacture profitably in the sub-$50k range (competing with the Audi/BMW/MB low end), with a car that is range-comparable to the S? In other words, can they build a genuinely useful electric drivetrain for about the same price as an internal combustion drivetrain?<p>Next, as they start spinning up long-term reliability figures (real people driving real Teslas in real conditions for the 100k+ miles we expect today), will costs remain comparable?<p>Third, how long will it take Audi/BMW/Lexus/etc to develop fully electric cars of their own that are performance-comparable and compatible with whatever public charging systems start to develop?",1369087247

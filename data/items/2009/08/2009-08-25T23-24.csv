If all you're doing is <i>writing an editorial in the Wall Street Journal</i>, where's the rationale? What's so offensive about writing an editorial that it deserves a <i>boycott</i>? What's so offensive about simple disagreement? If I happen to agree with John Mackey will you stop being friends with me? Refuse to let me borrow a couple bucks for lunch even if I have an excellent record for paying you back? Not come to my yard sale?

786154,comment,785434,785434,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"After my freshman year of college I hitchhiked from Washington DC to San Francisco, zig-zagging across the US.  While I did not travel with absolutely nothing (nor did I hitch the entire way; parts of it I went by bus), I wound up spending between $2 and $5 a day on food, so I think my experience is sufficiently similar to what was talked about in the OP to comment.<p>There were several important points missed by the OP.  Hitchhiking across long distances is slow and incredibly discouraging--especially in featureless areas like the US Midwest.  Heck knows how people on the Oregon trail managed it.  People almost universally insist on dropping you off in a town or a city, but nobody picks up hitchhikers inside of a town or city (unless they're willing to pay their way), so you have to walk back out into the middle of nowhere before you'll have much of a chance of picking up a ride.<p>If you ever do find yourself hitchhiking, you want to immediately protect yourself from the climate.  (This ought to be obvious, but apparently isn't based on my interactions with some people regarding this sort of thing.)  In places where it's cold, you want to be sure to be wearing something warm and dry; in places where it's warm, you'll want to have bottles for water, and a means to carry it (and I don't just mean the dinky kind you can usually get as bottled water...by the end of my journey I was happily carrying two 2-liter soda bottles and a 1-liter bottle someone had given me for water in the backpack I had brought with me).<p>Speaking of items to have with you, a towel actually is useful--something large enough to use as a blanket to cut down on heat loss due to wind, something you can wet down and wrap around your head to cool off in high heat, something to help clean yourself off when the opportunity presents itself.<p>Whatever you do, you should try to be aware of local laws and practices and how they will affect you; for instance, while it is technically illegal to walk along interstate roads in most of the US, it's not likely you'll attract police attention unless you walk dangerously close to traffic, or appear to be obviously armed and dangerous.  The one time I was picked up for this, the cop dropped me off at a nearby exit and gave me directions on how to efficiently complete the next leg of my journey using only state and local roads.<p>This segues nicely into another general principle.  Be nice to people you run into.  As long as it doesn't look like you have anything worth taking, essentially every human interaction you have will be positive as long as you act positively towards others--this is more true than usual, since, as a hitchhiker, no one can really expect to get everything from you, so the only people who will interact with you at all will be people who want to help you.  Such people can be easily discouraged if you don't appear friendly, or grateful for their assistance.<p>There's a lot more to be said about the hitchhiking experience, but the most important point to drive home is this: traveling long distances, mostly on foot, is not to be undertaken lightly.  It is grueling, unpredictable, and often discouraging.  It is not a good way to get from point A to point B, when they are separated by large distances.  But it will let you meet a variety of interesting people in--and see a lot more of--the space in between.",1251243493

786152,comment,785615,785762,0,0,lsc,,,"the reason why many of us charge by the hour is that it requires less negotiation.   When is the project 'done'?  a flat rate contract requires a lot of work up front to define things that might be better defined after you are most of the way done.    Hourly rates make last minute changes simple, and mean that you don't have to argue if it's a last minute change or not.<p>it also means that the employer bears more of the risk if the work is harder than originally imagined.<p>(Now, I also agree with your points about why charging a flat rate is better; I'm just pointing out that there are also reasons why charging an hourly rate is better.)",1251243450

It doesn't matter whether Mackey's argument was reasonable. People are fired up and motivated, and that energy can be tapped to influence Whole Foods, and then influence another company, and another. The more we use the muscle, the stronger it gets.<p>What the boycotters don't understand is that you get nowhere if a bunch of disconnected individuals just stop buying something because they're angry. It only works if you make specific well-publicized demands, continue the boycott until the demands are met, and then end it. A boycott without demands is tactically pathetic.

786115,comment,785293,785293,0,0,philwelch,,,"This isn't the first mysterious incident with cargo ships and the Russians I've heard of.<p>I grew up in Port Angeles, Washington. Port Angeles is located on the Olympic Peninsula, across the Strait of Juan de Fuca from Vancouver Island. The Strait of Juan de Fuca just happens to be the primary route to the Pacific Ocean from Naval Submarine Base Bangor, in nearby Bremerton. Bangor is one of two naval bases in the United States that houses America's fleet of Trident nuclear missile submarines.<p>A Russian cargo ship anchored itself in the middle of the strait about twelve years ago and just sat there without explaining themselves. The obvious explanation is that the Russians were probably counting submarines leaving and returning to Bangor. I suspect the Strait is shallow enough that it's not feasible for the submarines to leave the Strait submerged, and on fishing trips my dad and I saw one of them. Even surfaced, they are damn silent. I suppose they could have left Bangor through Canadian waters, though I don't know the political feasibility of sailing subs full of nuclear weapons through Canadian waters.<p>After the Russian cargo ship hung out in the strait for awhile, the American authorities figured they'd investigate it. So they got together with the Canadians and flew a helicopter over the ship. The ship evidently shone a laser at the helicopter (this is a couple of years before the days when lasers were an everyday cat toy) and blinded the American naval intelligence officer that was observing the ship. Investigating further, the Coast Guard decided to board the ship and search it for the laser. When they got around to boarding the ship, the laser was nowhere to be found. Eventually, the ship left the Strait.",1251241791

Given how prone they are to underestimating costs like this, these numbers are more likely to be a floor than a ceiling and don't include the deficits that come after!  It is however perhaps telling that those who support Obama's plan would be offended by the quote which doesn't necessarily use the term socialism in the pejorative sense.<p>What I don't understand is the guy who compared Thatcher to the Third Reich.  Do they forget what ""Nazi"" actually stands for?  Anyway, what is even more frustrating is that unions now want to have John Mackay <i>fired</i> for having the gall to disagree with the President (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/08/25/business-specialized-consumer-services-us-whole-foods-union_6813165.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/08/25/business-specializ...</a>).

It seems that what it did right has proven more important than what it did wrong in this case, in fact, further attesting to the value of what it did right.<p>If you want to do a similar job better than Craigslist did, you should probably do what Craigslist did right, and look for ways to improve it without undercutting those positives.

What I said was that some of use have been aware of such principles for years, and telling others about them.  One hopes that sharing such principles would involve applying them properly, rather than naively trying to copy someone else's formula.<p>Do you just dislike Craigslist, and thus hate anything related to it -- including its principles of success and anyone who happens to be aware of some of those principles?<p>I, for one, have never told anyone ""You should base your business model on Craigslist's model!"" but I have said ""You should probably simplify your business model.

873422,comment,872283,873032,0,0,neilc,,,"<i>leveraging shared memory and other operating system tools, you can turn a fork(2) implementation into a thread alternative -- but then, you'd have ... threads</i><p>There's an important difference: in the threading model, all memory is shared by default, whereas in the processes + shm model, you need to explicitly allocate and access shared memory regions. Because sharing mutable state is such an important design consideration, being explicit about what is being shared improves reliability by reducing the chance of unintentional sharing. A related benefit is that processes are protected from one another by the virtual memory mechanism: it is much more feasible for a service to recover from a crashed process than to recover from a crashed thread (which typically takes down the entire process).",1255189809

The results were anonymous (except for one time when a glitch let everyone see what everyone else said about them).<p>The comments were generally not very helpful, but for those used it to give good feedback it was mildly beneficial. Some people took it seriously and gave feedback which was useful. Other people used it to vent and others merely went though and added things like ""Good employee"" to meet the required number of comments.<p>Most of us hated it, but I think the management liked it. You could instantly see what your employees thought of each other.<p>When it came time for evaluations and raises, the results always closely aligned with the results of your peer rankings.

They are trying to create there own self fulfilling prophecy. Until India and the rest of the world creates an atmosphere of innovation (which requires certain human rights) they will not overtake the US as the dominate business factory nor will  they be the leader in cutting edge tech services. There will come a day that it would be foreseeable that a Google or an Intel will form out of a new country of origin but right now culturally there are few destinations for that to happen. Quite honestly Brazil seems like a far more likely candidate if we where solely looking at emerging countries.

Short history tangent:<p>> (Donald Gibbs, of Pearl-Harbor conspiracy-theory infamy)<p>I had thought thae ""USA wanted in to WWII and provoked Japan"" was just a generally accepted position by most everyone who'd looked into it.<p>United States companies were responsible for 80% of Japan's oil. U.S. Government bans companies from exporting oil to Japan, declares Japan ""a hostile nation"", and starts stationing more troops, supplies, and armaments in the American-owned places you'd need troops to launch an attack against Japan.<p>Following the embargo, Japan goes into ""oil shock"". They're set to run out of oil in two years. Consumer prices for oil-based products go up 10x or more. The nearest place where there was oil was Indonesia, which was at the time was owned by European colonial powers already at war with Japan.<p>Here's a decent world map:<p><a href=""http://www.ciese.org/curriculum/boilproj/images/Reference%20Material_world_pol98.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ciese.org/curriculum/boilproj/images/Reference%20...</a><p>America owned the Philippines at the time. Japan's war was taking them into Indonesia. The United States had just declared Japan a hostile nation, embargoed them, and started moving troops and arms into the Philippines and Hawaii.<p>It was obvious Japan would attack the United States following those events. Since United States foreign intelligence and military analysis were very good at this time, the pretty obvious conclusion is that the U.S. Government wanted war with Japan. Later, Pearl Harbor was sold as attacking for no reason to the American people for PR reasons, but the leadership must have known that their actions made a Republic of USA/Empire of Japan war pretty inevitable.",1255188276

On the contrary I have seen the trust of family members abused by their employers.<p>I do believe in positive effects of loyalty, but that loyalty can only function when it is mutual. The reality I have seen for myself and my family is that corporate loyalty does not exist.

In theory that relationship is a capitalistic trade of time for money, but the severing of that relationship is far more disruptive to the individual. I think much of the resentment found among employees results from the loser's choice between a poor employment situation and the uncertainty and upheaval of changing employers.<p>Only I can take responsibility for my own well-being.<p>Edit: The one counterexample I have seen is SAS.

6372730,comment,6366912,6367419,1,0,DannyBee,,,"&quot;I think the problem with many corporate lawyers is the same as with many corporate programmers working at large, traditional corporations: risk takers are heavily penalized, and those who make traditional, low-risk decisions are rewarded. You know, the whole &quot;nobody ever got fired for using Java&quot; bit.
&quot;<p>Depends entirely on the corporate culture.
Where I work, this would be very wrong. 
As for private lawyers, i think you have it very backwards in practice.<p>Corporate lawyers, in a culture where lawyers are doing what they should be (assessing risks and informing clients about them, in priority order and explaining tradeoffs and possible workarounds), are risk takers.    They don&#x27;t make business decisions, they essentially try to solve legal problems creatively.  In these cultures, ineffective lawyers who don&#x27;t understand what matters get fired.<p>Corporate lawyers, in a culture where lawyers have say over products or business decisions, go very badly, for the reasons you mentioned.  It is seriously inept management that puts lawyers in a go/no-go position over business decisions (not &quot;this is illegal we will get arrested decisions&quot;), and even more inept when they don&#x27;t hold them accountable for whatever time they waste.<p>Most private lawyers are not held accountable for wasting everyone&#x27;s time.  They are still paid.  They still get used. People just suck it up.  So they actually are almost exactly like what you have described to the corporate lawyers.<p>Very good private lawyers are more like the corporate lawyers in a good culture.",1378972750

6372595,comment,6371932,6372441,3,0,wisty,,,"> Suddenly, new subjects became incomprehensible. The ease at which I previously absorbed new material was gone. Nothing &quot;clicked&quot; anymore. I&#x27;m in graduate school now and still nothing &quot;clicks&quot;. I attend department seminars where visiting professors present their research, and it may as well be alien gibberish. I feel like I&#x27;m just faking my way through grad school at this point. I can still manage A&#x27;s and B&#x27;s in classes without ever understanding the content only because of the way the grading system&#x27;s designed. Luckily, I seemed to have retained my programming capabilities.<p>Once you&#x27;ve gotten past basic calculus, you can&#x27;t learn as much because all the resources are poor. Sure, you can read research papers (which are written for people who already understand 90% of them), or a PhD thesis (maybe a better option, as PhD students pad them with lots of exposition to make up the page count); but they suck compared to a well-designed undergrad text. Did you learn calculus by reading a single proof, or did you do a lot of example questions? How much are you practicing the basic techniques, or are you just saying &quot;yeah, in principle that bit&#x27;s already been done ... nothing to do there&quot;.<p>You also sound like you are losing motivation, and suffering a bit from &quot;impostor syndrome&quot;, both of which are very common in grad school. You need to learn when to relax, when to push yourself, and when to just keep plugging. I find that forcing myself to relax when I&#x27;m getting distracted can &quot;reset&quot; my ability to focus. If you find yourself reading something that&#x27;s just crap (this sentence?), look away from the monitor for as long as you can.",1378970721
6372594,comment,6371559,6372148,0,0,r0h1n,,,"> However, you seem to misunderstand the meaning of &quot;double-blind&quot;. It does not mean &quot;blind&quot; in the literal sense. It only means that neither the experimenter nor the subject are consciously aware of which piece of equipment is under test.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if I wasn&#x27;t being clear enough. Allow me to restate in somewhat better terms (I hope).<p>I maintain that our choices are uniquely and indivisibly (a) personal, (b) subjective, and (c) the product of <i>all</i> our senses. Take one away, and what&#x27;s left isn&#x27;t really a &#x27;choice&#x27; any longer.<p>I agree that a double-blind test isn&#x27;t about literal blinding, but it does blind one or more of your senses. Let me illustrate using two hypothetical examples:<p>- if I do a double-blind test b/w the iPhone 5, 5s and 5c, masking everything else but their screens, are we all so confident that we&#x27;d pick the very same model that we picked up in a store or a website? All I&#x27;ve done is to &#x27;blind&#x27; you to the exterior appearance of the phone, which means (per the double-blind enthusiasts), you&#x27;re then judging the phones based on only features like speed, animation smoothness, screen quality etc. etc. Worse, if you end up picking a different model than what you&#x27;d done IRL, did that mean Apple tricked you?<p>- say there are two different flavours of ice-cream, both of which look the same and come from the same company. But one of them is 25% more expensive, and contains an additional ingredient that makes it smell &#x27;better&#x27; than the other <i>to you</i>. Now what if I design a blind test that blocks your smell and I ask you choose the better ice-cream. Would you still pick the same? I don&#x27;t know. Because your choice of ice-cream was made using <i>all your senses</i>. Now it&#x27;s entirely possible that the company is making more profits from the more expensive flavour merely by adding some relatively inexpensive flavour. Should you then change back to the other flavour because that&#x27;s what your &#x27;objective&#x27; test tells you? If you did, are you sure you&#x27;d enjoy the ice-cream just as much as you did earlier?<p>I&#x27;m not defending snake-oil peddling audiophile equipment makers, just saying that the value of what they (or anyone else, like, heck Bose!) sell is personal and subjective. Like most HN skeptics, I stay clear of them, but I also remain open-minded to the idea that there may be folks who find value in them and that I will never be able to truly understand why.<p>> Or, put another way, you may want all of your vinyl blessed by the pope, but I&#x27;m not going to pay extra for it.<p>Totally agree. Sure, do any number of tests and research before making your own choices. But don&#x27;t expect that others will feel bound to those tests the same way. Which is what the original discussion was about, namely that &quot;advocates of DSD are skeptical of double-blind experiments&quot;.<p>They have a right to. And we cannot &quot;prove&quot; them wrong.",1378970721

It used to be called MVCU - model-view-controller-user. The &quot;model&quot; is the idea of the data as it exists in the users mind, the view is how the system presents it, and the controller works with what the user &quot;do&quot; with the model through the view.<p>It gets confused if you don&#x27;t realize there are two data models: the <i>&quot;data&quot; model</i> - how the data is modelled in the abstract (and confusingly, <i>internally in the program/database</i>) -- that is <i>distinct</i> from the model in MVC. So the original MVC &quot;model&quot; is closer to &quot;domain model&quot; than to &quot;data model&quot;.<p>Now, in the dark 90s, when everyone had forgotten that users existed, something that no-one would realize until &quot;agile&quot; emerged and surprised everyone, these two &quot;models&quot; got mixed up -- and no one was able to understand this MVC thing ;-)",1378970700

I agree you can use jQuery without a strong fundamental knowledge of JS. So fair point.<p>The description for the first level of JS Frameworks and Libraries is &quot;you can tap into libraries like jQuery&quot;. So it&#x27;s really saying is that jQuery requires JS, but you can use jQuery Effects without knowing jQuery. Also, there&#x27;s no way you could get to level 3 of jQuery Effects tree (writing your own effects) without at least knowing some JS [1]. So pretty sure there&#x27;s a bug in there.<p>But that&#x27;s probably way too much pedantry about a skill tree that&#x27;s just for fun. Onto the actually interesting question of how well you can know jQuery without knowing JS. I think it works like this: if you know how to use jQuery, ipso facto you can use JS at least as well. If you&#x27;re just doing some pattern-matched jQuery stuff, that&#x27;s cool, but it&#x27;s also pattern-matched JS stuff, because, well, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re writing in. The more advanced you are at JS, the more advanced you&#x27;re capable of being in jQuery. There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to be able to, say, write your own plugins are build complicated stuff without knowing the language you&#x27;re writing it in. [2]<p>It&#x27;s also probably worth noting that once you know JS really well, learning your way around jQuery is almost trivial. So I posit that trying to learn jQuery without learning JS is a Bad Idea.<p>[1] I guess that&#x27;s a general issue with skill trees. B requires A as a prerequisite, but the tree doesn&#x27;t capture that B level 2 requires A level 2.<p>[2] I confess this not an argument from experience and that I could be wrong; I&#x27;d love to hear stories to the contrary. I had the misfortune of learning JS in the bad old days before jQuery and friends.

I completely lost the will to work and ended up with humiliatingly low grades before finally breaking down and starting afresh.<p>Like you I got into the habit of getting distracted online. Failing university was a sufficiently strong blow to my ego that I finally &quot;woke up&quot; and attempted to analyze what went wrong in my life: I came to the conclusion that my addiction to random bullshit on the internet had completely eaten my mind. The constant procrastination had eventually caused me to sink into depression, thus worsening the cycle even more. It got so bad I was unable to concentrate for more than 2 hours on the same subject. By contrast I used to read several books a week on various subjects.<p>I decided to drastically change my lifestyle. I cut away all non-essential internet use and went cold turkey.

For all of those who seek a UI advise, I have a tip.<p>I have done a lot of pondering about GUIs since I began programming. I ended up in mantaining a 12 year old project, with more than 400 individual forms (that&#x27;s for a single client, we&#x27;ve got 4 more). Damn, I was lucky.<p>The project really blew my mind! It crushed most of the assumptions which I made while reading articles or developing toy applications.<p>And here&#x27;s the thing:<p>It uses most of the &quot;bad practices&quot;, &quot;anti-patterns&quot;, or however the internet calls today the &quot;I was bitten once and didn&#x27;t find the way out&quot; thing, in it&#x27;s codebase and still is ridiculously maintainable. With very much likelyhood it will survive another 12 years. Partly, because of the contract, but the point still holds. :)<p>So, my bold advice: just ignore all the naysayers and make up your own mind. Event&#x27;s are bad? It they solve a problem giving another one or two in exchange, there most probably is another solution fixing those two too. And while the problems never end, at one time you end up with a framework that covers 90% of needs, correctly.<p>&quot;Yeah, we can&#x27;t notify the remote client about the update on the model, when it&#x27;s in a form rollback phase and when it has at least one two-dimensionally time tracked attribute. It isn&#x27;t possible, because it interferes with the data history stack. We should not have used events at the very beginning at all.&quot; Damn, that&#x27;s a tough problem. Wait, what does your UI do !?<p>At the project I&#x27;m working on it took a lot of work and at least one PhD thesis to get it where it is today. I can&#x27;t give out all details, but if anyone&#x27;s interested, there are few open sourced parts. But You will find plenty of good libraries already.<p>I also made a simple JAVA Swing project on github using some of the gained knowledge. If anyone would find that interesting, just leave a comment.<p>I hope such good UI articles come up more often in the HN feed. And please, do write as much technical details as possible.",1378969831

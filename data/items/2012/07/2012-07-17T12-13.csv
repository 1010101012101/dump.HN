Of course, the peer-reviewing itself is done free of charge by fellow academics. The Nature post doesn't seem to address this point (unless this is what they refer to as ""up-front publication costs"" in the second paragraph).<p>Either way, charges around GBP 2,000 per article for processing are hefty (especially given that the bulk of the work is done by the academics for free). Maybe one should ask the question how this figure could be driven down?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/15/free-access-british-scientific-research?fb=optOut"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/15/free-access-br...</a>",1342529980

4255463,comment,4253312,4253312,2,0,NinjaWarrior,,,"People who say ""Flash is dying!"" don't know what Flash can actually do. Flash is active technology. If you think Flash is obsolete and outdated, STOP USING ALL OF THESE IMMEDIATELY.<p>- Most PC browser games
  HTML5 is not ready to handle rich games for many practical reasons. You may not have an interest to games, but browser games have a big market and very lucrative.<p>- Quite a lot of iOS/Android apps
  Using AIR to develop crossplatform applications. Currently HTML5 solutions such as PhoneGap have a major performance issue because of the lack of iOS JIT. AIR compiles ActionScript codes to LLVM and compiled code runs relatively fast (and I think it's a clever and balanced way to develop applications on low perforamnce smartphones. C++ is inefficient to develop, and JavaScript is too slow).<p>- AAA console games on Xbox360/PS3/PC
  Using Scaleform to redner 2D user interfaces. Do you know the title screen, game menues, HUDs and so on are actually SWF? Game artists author them with Adobe Flash CS!<p>- Streaming video sites
  Hulu never exists without Flash DRM streaming.<p>- Many kiosk terminals
  Using Flash for their UIs. Both Flash runtime and the authoring tool (Flash CS) are needed. Indeed HTML5 is coming but HTML5 can only replace runtimes.<p>Certainly Flash has many problems but it's not so bad technology overall. And it will used for relative long time (I guess 5-10 years or so). Flash has many reasons to be used widely.<p>And you must admit that HTML5 is improving rapidly because it is trying to overcome plugins like Flash. Flash is a very good stimulation for browser vendors. Because of this, I can say so-called ""plug-in free"" is not a good idea. Copmpetiton is healthy (WebGL developer also is saying so!).<p>Actually, there is a great demand for Flash animators to develop recent social games. Currently Japanese major social game company GREE forcuses Unity and AIR and they are saying HTML5 doesn't meet their needs for now. Of course that will change in coming 2 or 3 years though (looks like iOS 6 has some important improvements. Web Audio API, requestAnimationFrame and multitouch bug fix).<p>By the way, this author Scott Handsaker made this Flash grave picture? Soft of obsessive. I look down on the guys like this. They don't have respect for important technologies.<p>Sorry for my poor English, but I can't stop saying something for the current situation. Flash is a poor and underestimated technology.",1342529886

McDonalds in France has a high rate of corporate store ownership and operation compared to other countries (20% in France compared to 15% globally) because of a previous bad experience with the national franchisee (it was fought out in a court battle[1]) and that store being a marquee store for the brand in Europe.<p>My only theory as to why this happen is that the staff were confronted with a situation that they were not accustomed to dealing with and that caused them to react poorly.

It is just a matter of identifying the endpoint, so the HTTP router can delegate requests from one user to the same backend instance in any given session. This, in turn, will give a user a consistent image of the state at the server independently of cache propagation in the backend. For example. You don't need the user's real life identity to do this, and you don't need the same identity across different sites or across different sessions.<p>This is currently sometimes done by cookies, which makes life difficult for HTTP routers. He is proposing a mechanism to keep the identifying-part while getting rid of problems in the HTTP router layer. The way I read this, it seemed to be without introducing additional privacy concerns and in fact removing some. (Cookies can carry more than identity)<p>There is a detailed technical discussion to be had about implementing all of this, and in this discussion any privacy concerns would become visible and open for discussion.

In particular, at at least one university, profs are now being told that they may be <i>required</i> to teach a course via Coursera, or at least strongly requested to. And, the universities don't want to budget this as actual teaching, so it's just extra work on top of the normal class load: since Coursera courses aren't credit-hours, they don't give teaching credit. It's supposed to count under ""service"" or ""outreach"", I guess, the way serving on committees or reviewing papers or doing a CNN interview does. (This part may vary by university.)<p>Not sure that's a good recipe for high-quality courses via this method.

For a can of Coke!?! Can you believe that! Please arrest him!"" the police will likely tell you ""you're lucky you didn't get shot"".<p>In France the photographer is considered the perpetrator. The police will not help him (and maybe worse if he insists...)<p>Also, ""assault"" is very different here than in the US; grabbing someone by the arm or pushing him around isn't considered assault (more like a disagreement).<p>That said, you can get very far with asking first: many people, if asked, won't mind being photographed (but you have to ask every person, and respect every decision, which would make the whole process pretty complex).",1342527174

However, there was no further update regarding the status of these plans. As a result, I had to correspond with the company to seek updates regarding their announcements. Obviously, this led to a series of email's being exchanged, along with expected delays in communication. I found this process to be quite redundant & unpredictable.<p>Now, imagine others in this situation having to follow a similar protracted process to find the same information. Is there a way to optimize this process, thereby saving time & effort for both the company & the prospective customer? After analyzing the situation, a collaborative solution seemed to be the best option.<p>I'm not sure how many people face this situation.

I use ZSH and all the terminal emulators I&#x27;ve tried (Stock Crunchbang, Ubuntu, LXDE on Ras-pi and xfce terminals, along with xterm, and my current favorite urxvt) support emacs keybindings. I&#x27;m pretty sure thats a per shell thing though, as I switched ZSH to Vi keybindings with no problem. If you don&#x27;t use TMUX or Screen, it&#x27;s not hard to get the normal copy and paste bindings working in any of the emulators I mentioned. With the exception of xterm and urxvt, ctrl-c and ctrl-v usually just work. In xterm and urxvt, you have a little bit of work to do to configure the keybindings, but once that&#x27;s done, it just works. I like urxvt so much that I&#x27;m actually looking to replace iterm2 with something like it. x11.app will run urxvt, but since x is it&#x27;s own windowing system, it doesn&#x27;t work with my window management on OS X. Bummer.<p>When I use a desktop environment my favorite desktop environment is xfce, although I do like Elementary OS. However, normally I&#x27;m not running a DE. I started my Linux journey dual booting Ubuntu 12.04 and Crunchbang. Eventually, due to some dumb mistake with apt while trying to install a package on Crunchbang (#!), I reinstalled #! and wiped out Ubuntu. (I to have a hatred for Unity) Eventually, I discovered the Awesome window manager. I haven&#x27;t looked back since. Awesome is completely configurable in Lua, so any key binding you want is possible. I have super+enter (super is the windows key on my keyboard) set to open a terminal, super+w bound to open my browser, and several other keyboard shortcuts like that. Also, Awesome 3+ has a task runner like Alfred built in. I have it bound to Ctrl+space.<p>I&#x27;m still using Awesome, but now I&#x27;m on Arch. I didn&#x27;t like how slow Debian stable (the base for #!) updated, so I switched to Manjaro and loved it, but I ran into a problem where I couldn&#x27;t install a library for some software I wanted. (I probably just didn&#x27;t have the right repositories configured, but I&#x27;ll never know.) I&#x27;d been considering Arch for a while, so I did a practice install in VirtualBox. It wasn&#x27;t terribly difficult with the tutorial I found on Youtube. After getting everything working in Virtualbox. I did the install on my computer.<p>I think I&#x27;ve installed Arch on my machine twice now. One of those times I used pacman to generate a list of the packages I had on one install, saved it to a thumb drive, then wrote a python script to parse the list and install the software I was missing. I set the script lose and got in the shower. When I got out, everything was installed.<p>Last thing, the Arch wiki is an invaluable resource for all things Linux. Sure, the package management commands are wrong, but the configuration instructions for things aren&#x27;t. Even if the files are in a different place, the Arch wiki gives you enough info that you should be able to run find or grep in one of the parent directories and find what you&#x27;re looking for.<p><a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_page"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_page</a>",1424360860

What about the things you can&#x27;t measure, but may matter to the health of your workers?<p>For most people, using their experiences throughout their life as a perspective.  Once you get into a new workplace, you can use those years of experience as a basis for perspective relative to the observations of the new workplace. For a lot of people, their intuition makes this kind of thing obvious once they start looking at the data and look around casually in the workspace with note of looking at the people, their movements, and what they&#x27;re doing.  It&#x27;s the kind of thing that after working at a new place for a week, I already would have a solid feeling and a useful perspective — not just from the new workplace, but comparing that new workplace based on my experience of other workplaces that I&#x27;ve worked in, consulted for, and otherwise visited.<p>But, there are formal studies on human interactions in the business workplace addressing all three of these questions. I don&#x27;t have particular citations of interest off-hand.<p>> I still don&#x27;t see how knowing stair steps in isolation will generate any valuable insight.<p>Strictly empirically speaking, it doesn&#x27;t really. However, this set data from one location <i>combined</i> with observational perspective of the people within the space, could easily lead to more informed conjecture and related hypotheses.<p>However, the novelty of the single location data set may be as useful distraction; to serve as an element introducing &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;amusement&quot; into the workplace at acceptable levels of &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;amusement&quot;.  (There are studies on this, as well.  This information can serve as a device to break monotony and a &quot;humdrum&quot; atmosphere.  You can employ other devices as well.  For example, free soda can be used as a device.  Whether or not that device works effective and the full consequences (positive & negative) is beyond the scope of this simple comment.)<p>If you want to pursue this beyond typical intuition, I recommend taking human behavior studies in psychology with respect to interior design and architecture.<p>This goes beyond just traffic flow, but incorporates other aspects of the environment and its influence on humans.<p>However, you don&#x27;t need to have academic training to be useful.

I already rarely connect to free wifi because I have a cellphone - when I use my laptop I can just tether.<p>The two main blockers for most people (at least Americans) are cell providers who charge insane rates for tethering and international roaming. Tmobile has revealed that it&#x27;s possible to provide both at a reasonable rate (&quot;T-Mobile CEO John Legere has estimated that profit margins on international roaming fees can be about 90 percent&quot;), so the current situation is just an inefficiency that will eventually die off.<p>To me, we should still encourage hotels to do the right (modern) thing.

For example, think of the type parameter that describes the elements of a list.<p>- It is &quot;mappable&quot; in the sense that its contained type can be converted to another type by providing an operation from the first type to the second type. Imagine converting a list of strings to a list of integers, where each integer is the length of the corresponding string.<p>- It can be &quot;flattened&quot; in the sense that if its inner type is an extra nesting of the container type, it can be flattened to a just one level of the container type. For example, a list of lists of integers can be flattened to just a list of integers by concatenating the sublists.<p>- It seems kind of trivial to say, but there has to be a way to construct a container given one of the elements it&#x27;s supposed to contain.<p>There are also a couple of rule these operations have to fulfill. They&#x27;re kind of abstract when stated on their own, but make intuitive sense when you consider examples.<p>Pretty simple, huh? What&#x27;s cool about it is that you can assign all sorts of metadata to the container type and semantics to the flatten operation, and you get a nice representation of a pipeline of operations, where each one depends on the all the previous steps. This is basically just imperative programming -- each step depends on the current context and can optionally mutate that context, affecting subsequent steps.<p>You might ask, &quot;but isn&#x27;t imperative programming what we&#x27;re trying <i>not</i> to do?&quot; In the most general sense with mutable state everywhere, yes.

NICMOS was supposed to last something like 4 years if I remember correctly. It died in about two. A whole slew of gyros failed, degrading performance, and jacking up schedules so we could replace them. COSTAR is a pretty obvious failure that wasn&#x27;t fully recovered from (COSTAR took up one of four slots that were meant for instruments). Lots of stuff goes wrong. But maybe they could have designed a Hubble-class telescope that would last ten years back then. I don&#x27;t know for sure. My gut says the first one would have been a piece of crap with a bad mirror and shitty gyros. That&#x27;s a lot of work to throw away.<p>Either way, would launching three (or six or whatever) of those on rockets really have been cheaper than the Hubble in terms of science/dollar? I have some serious doubts. Throw in the politics and overhead of three major missions, and you&#x27;re talking big numbers.<p>And that ignores the intrinsic value of manned missions for their own sake - you must do them to get good at them. There are people who say that we should never do a manned mission, and that all the data we want to collect can be had by unmanned satellites and whatnot. While it may be very close to true, that&#x27;s a very short-sighted point of view in my opinion.",1424359213

Much of this is due to the fact that it&#x27;s a very small population (fluctuating between 60-100 people during the time I was there) living about 35 miles from anywhere remotely consequential. So much of its flavour is due to simply to being relatively deeply embedded in nature. When I moved back to a &quot;regular&quot; city (in this case, Phoenix), the two biggest shocks were the loss of the night sky, and the fact that &quot;regular&quot; cities are straight-up engineered to kill you. The failure to look both ways before crossing the street is a death sentence; this made walking around a city feel like an exercise in continually dashing between some cold-war-era Berlin-wall no-man&#x27;s land. Took me years to become habituated to this, and it still bugs me if I think about it.<p>In many ways, Arcosanti is like any other small, rural, company town. Everybody is always up in everybody else&#x27;s business; the politics of the company are all-pervasive and often petty; and if you want to achieve aspirations which aren&#x27;t within the scope of the official agenda, you leave. On the other hand, living there is extraordinarily easy: the pay is low but the expenses are practically nil. The average American spends 2/3rds of their earnings on housing and transport; at Arcosanti, those things cost $150/month. I earned minimum wage and could still afford to go skydiving every other weekend. I&#x27;ve never had so much leisure time or disposable income since.<p>It&#x27;s a place of weirdly limited and expansive horizons. Like I said: if you wish to do something other than what the company is doing -- start your own full-time business, take your concept of &quot;arcology&quot; in a different direction, etc. -- then you can&#x27;t do that there. It&#x27;s not a real city: it&#x27;s a company town. On the other hand, it attracts a constant stream of quite high-calibre, globally-connected people; late night conversations around the fireplace can be pretty special experience. I recall getting into good-nature drunken arguments with folks like Stephen J. Gould, Jaron Lanier, and Terry Riley. Not a bad place for a teenage hacker to grow up.",1424359197

And it&#x27;s not so much of the obvious patterns, but maybe those that didn&#x27;t seem obvious (until hindsight after the fact). Proximity and placement of different facilities (printing/copying facilities, toilet facilities, lounge/kitchen facilities) within the office space can lend to different interactions or even wasted time.<p>And, of course, one can casually observe and make qualitative observations.  But those qualitative observations may not necessarily be impartial nor rigorous in their recording. To avoid subjectivity and anecdotal evidence, quantitative evidence through raw data recording aids in eliminating potential subjectivity.<p>Based on this, you may choose to layout the office space differently.  Or when choosing a new office, you may better know certain attributes you&#x27;re looking for in a space.<p>For example, Pixar&#x27;s centrally located toilet facilities intentionally shape traffic flow with the intent of increasing interactions among employees for facilitating potential conversation and discussion.<p>As shiftpgdn mentioned, another example seen often is stairs vs. escalator/elevator usage for encouraging subtle, healthier choices. The counter, when displayed publicly for those respective areas, can serve as a mechanism for real-time, interactive feedback to the observer. Confronted with this reminder, it may coax them a little, giving them the little mental kick to use the stairs instead.<p>Maybe you determine that if you put an appropriately shaped obstruction — e.g., a wall with a sign of company logo — carefully placed immediately in front of the entryway, it may result in better flow through the that area. Notably, it might encourage people to not stop in the doorway, blocking; but rather proceeding further into the lobby area to converse.<p>Although more of a larger crowd thing in this example, studies have been done in this area and have demonstrated such results:  <a href=""http://www.americanscientist.org/science/pub/strategically-placed-obstacle-near-an-exit-can-speed-evacuations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanscientist.org/science/pub/strategically-p...</a><p>Related reading:<p>&quot;Handbook of Positive Behavior Support&quot; by Sailor, et al.; &quot;Behavior Supports in Nonclassroom Settings&quot; chapter, &quot;Features of the Physical Environment&quot; section (page 499).<p>&quot;Office Planning and Design Desk Reference&quot; by Rappoport, et al.",1424358813

9074374,comment,9072842,9072842,0,0,chernevik,,,"IMHO, I think the material here is too brief, and insufficiently progressive, to help a beginner move to confidence.  To master concepts, people need repetition, and application of concepts to problems of sufficient difference to see the fundamentals of the concept apart from any particular.  Giving people a dozen tasks, each introducing some different concept, won&#x27;t leave them with a basis for a confident understanding.<p>I also think beginners need:<p>-  A strong grasp of DISTINCT.  This prepares them for the division of tables into subsets by GROUP BY, which is vital to an understanding of how aggregation and window functions operate.  ORDER BY can used to show beginners how they can first organize the data, and see how different values in different fields can be used to segregate records into groups.<p>- WHERE is important but actually not that hard to communicate.  The key things about WHERE are one, you can specify true / false expressions whose evaluation dictates inclusion or exclusion of a record (this is crucial to understanding how a JOIN works), and two, you can use IN to compare a record&#x27;s value to a _list_ of values.  Once someone grasps this, it becomes very easy for them to see how a subquery works.<p>- A strong grasp of how subqueries work.  One of the great strengths of SQL is the ability to encapsulate complexity into a subquery and pass that result on to another query for further use.<p>- A thorough walk-through on &quot;how&quot; JOINs work.  What does it mean to JOIN two records?  To JOIN two tables?  How do we &quot;filter&quot; that join of two tables?  (All of this at a _conceptual_ level, taking care to note that how we might think through a complicated join is _not_ how the operation is implemented by the software.)  What is the difference between an INNER JOIN and a LEFT JOIN, and how are these differences useful?<p>- Some discussion of just what exactly SQL is, what it is used for, and what it isn&#x27;t used for.  The tool has to be placed into some context so that beginners are oriented to where they will encounter it and what they can use it for.  In particular they need to understand its interface, and the textual / non-visual nature of that interface.  Most people are accustomed to working with computers through GUIs.  The textual nature of SQL makes it very different, in profound ways, from the vast majority of tools people use on computers.",1424358629

No serviceability = higher risk.<p>You can indeed adapt your designs for unmanned launches and get a good life span out of them, but there are significant tradeoffs to doing so that impact the mission.<p>Further, there is value in manned missions <i>just because</i>.

Mint is just a step ahead of the rest.<p>For your &quot;mini-command-line&quot; utility, I&#x27;d recommend picking up Guake terminal, and using the very easy hotkey mapper to map opening the terminal to something dead easy, like LeftAlt+Space. Guake is totally configurable, but with those simple hotkeys, you&#x27;ll get a terminal. When you&#x27;re ready to switch back, hit the hotkeys again and it will hide the terminal (keeping your session live). It supports multiple terminal tabs, which you can also switch between with a configurable hotkey (I use Ctrl+Shift+o and Ctrl+Shift+p to move left and right, respectively). Of course the display is ultimately configurable, too, so you can have it docked basically anywhere, transparent if you&#x27;d like, or as big or as small as you&#x27;d like.

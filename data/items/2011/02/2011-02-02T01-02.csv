Look at eg HN -- you'd parse out id = some long number.  I may be wrong, but I don't recall many sites that would have good information for a search engine in that string.<p>What seems far more likely is bing is using click tracking on G's results.  This was explicitly <i>not</i> denied by their VP on the search engine panel today.  If not many sites except search engines have useful keywords in the query string, that pretty much validates Google's complaint.<p>In fact, if you go to Google's blogpost [1], the bing toolbar specifically calls out monitoring ""the searches you do, the websites you visit, [...]"" [1].  And the MS guy doesn't deny using clicks on G's search results [2].  In fact, the pretty much just says they copy G on long tail searches.<p>[1] <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-is-cheating-copying-our-search-results-62914"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-is-cheating-copying-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2011/02/01/thoughts-on-search-quality.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/20...</a>",1296611987

Between this and the account deletions of those who spoke loudly over Flickr's other account deletions, more and more Flickr is becoming a hostile system.<p>The lack of a retrieval system could be from a lack of Yahoo wishing to invest in upgrades to the platform in general.

In buenos aires, rentals were almost double for something similar (capital city pricing), and rio was slightly more expensive again (the Brazilian Real is very strong at the moment). If you would prefer not to stay in one place then most countries have 3g in major cities and usually you can find a prepaid plan which is reasonably priced as long as you use it for browsing rather than lots of youtube.<p>India, and thailand are less expensive than latin america, but it would be harder to learn the language and you'll more likely be spending time with other travellers.  Although, given you're on a gap year, then travellers hangouts in asia (beachs, mountains etc) could be fun.  I enjoyed Salvador in Brazil, lots of live music and dancing, Rio not so much, Buenos Aires feels very european in a good way, and it has the liveliness of a capital city. I've heard good things about Chang Mai and the islands in Thailand.  I spent several years in India and it is very cheap and very different , but except for Goa is generally not so much of a party place compared to say, Thailand.  In some places, craigslist will give you a rough idea of apartment pricing - although often there are many agents charging ridiculous prices, so find ads from private landlords to get a rough idea.  Otherwise use hostelbookers.com or hostelworld.com , as a proxy for rental prices. Lonely Planet thorntree forums are probably worth a search to get some kind of idea of a destination and/or prices.",1296611826

If the results only show up on Bing from google-clicks and not from clicks on the control, then it's a good indicator that Bing have Google-specific code. Then run the test a few more times with greater than 100 queries (which in SE land is a miniscule test set).<p>From what they've said, it seems like they only tested against fake clicks on google.com. That tells us Bing are using click data but nothing more. This is a pretty simple debugging technique, which is why I'm shocked if Google didn't think to do that.

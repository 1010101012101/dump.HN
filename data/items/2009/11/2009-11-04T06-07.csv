By extending welcoming arms to the best students they can get from anywhere, they've managed to go from being decent to being top notch.

Their next goal is to get ranked in the top 5 in the USA in math and science.<p>I doubt that USC will be the last university to try this strategy.

921211,comment,920668,920668,0,0,ctrager,,,"Disclaimer: I'm the author of an open source bug tracker, BugTracker.NET, a sorta hobby project that got better over time and sorta, kinda, ""competes"" with FogBugz.  Also, I receive money from Atlassian to display their ads on my website, but other than that, I know nothing about their business.  So, I'm not any sort of insider.  But I do pay attention to the space, and here's my two cents.<p>Some of the income for these companies comes from the hosted versions of their apps.  I think free and somewhat viral services like GitHub put a lot of pressure on Atlassian and FogCreek.  1) Downward pressure on what they can charge.  Consider Atlassian's recent price drop.  and 2) Classic Joel ""Fire and Motion"" pressure to match the competition's features.  Kiln is FogCreek returning defensive fire.<p>Not to mention less viral players but really nice playes in the hosted space like Unfuddle, Assembla.  Christ, even Google.<p>So, along with hosted apps, some of the income comes from installed software.  There, both companies compete against open source, like Trac, Redmine, and even my own BugTracker.NET.  Traditionally some stodgier companies have tended to be fearful about running open source alternatives, but there might be a generational change going on.  There could be a tipping point where open source developer tools start being perceived even by the stodgier companies as being the more comfortable, safe, mainstream choice. Safer than commercial.  That might already be happening with version control.",1257316995

921193,comment,920704,920850,0,0,netcan,,,"In some cases, the shift to digital content has shaken business models in a way that is not recoverable and has nothing to do with the enforcement of copyright. Newspapers are mostly examples of this.<p>The old world of media had a price for each viewer/reader of various mediums. The new world of media also has a price too and the old price doesn't apply. Readers are now usually worth substantially less then they were. An online news impression is worth less than a print one. In parallel, the democratisation of the web has created additional competition that has taken away some eyeballs, especially in the juicy parts of the business (eg classifieds). The effect of aggregators as competitors is an example of the type of effect that hurts them and is related to copyright somehow. This last is a very small & insignificant part of why they are failing.<p>In some cases, copyright enforcement might theoretically recover some or all of their revenues. Music is an example of this. If people couldn't pirate music, they would probably buy more of it. The move to digital probably affects sales somehow, but it is not necessarily negative. Film, TV, Books etc. are also examples of these cases.<p>The first type of company has business models made obsolete by technological & cultural changes. The second kind have business models that fail because the lost the ability to enforce copyright. Companies of the first kind usually think that they are of the second.

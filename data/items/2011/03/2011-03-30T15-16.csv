Maybe it's just me, but I submit that you are mistaken.  For example, I saw it, and it is of zero interest to me.  I write code for a living, I manage people who write code, I run two companies, one of which produces code, and I don't think it's of interest.<p>That doesn't mean it's of zero interest to everyone.

It's like giving a kid a cupcake liner filled with raw batter: you're going to make him cry.<p>I don't see NYC or any of the other regions mentionedLondon, Tokyo, the Valleybecoming irrelevant anytime soon. I doubt any city is going to steal the title of ""Capital of X"" from any of them, though the industries that drive the success of these cities may waneand wax and wane and wax andnew cities (or existing cities) will rise to prominence due to the development of new industries and new ways of working.<p>One of the ironies that always struck me about the Valley was that much of it was built on the dream on making distance no longer matter. Instant, global, paperless, tele-blah, and on and on. Yet the Valley continued (and continues) to matter.<p>What we think of as technology really isn't technology any longer, in any meaningful sense. Pencils and paper are technology, yet CTOs don't control the stationary cabinet. I've asked, sarcastically, CTOs why they don't show more interest in the legal pads and ballpoint pens, to make a point: computers and phones are no longer perceived as technology but as things.<p>And as things, along with other newly-just-a-thing things like web apps and virtualized servers and storage and clusters, the history and dynamics that favor the Valley don't necessarily support the sort of innovations that are going to make a big difference.<p>That's why the New Yorker article on Nick Denton, who, according to the article, is trying to bring a television-like time model to web advertisingand is working to kill the impression modelis so interesting. It details a guy that's using technologyyawn, programmersbut has internalized and is working to forward the interests of a completely different culture.<p>Of course, the existing web advertising mindset is a product of the application of the paper publishing world's advertising models, which just goes to show that as time passes it's less about how any given technology technology wants us to think but how we make sense of that technology.<p>So maybe the sorts of things that come out of the Valley will change. There's an understatement. Of course they've already changed!<p>Place has a huge role in shaping what happens. Where you live affects the way you think about the world. The way you think about the world affects where you want to live. (See Slate's ""The Big Sort"" coverage.)

2387515,comment,2387275,2387275,1,0,donnyg107,,,"I don't think many venture capital firms work precisely in the way this man describes. VC's aren't stupid, and they wouldn't do anything to actively limit their scope of companies to invest in. Every VC looks around for fresh ideas. I think that often times startups who know VCs will go to them with ideas, but not as a springboard or as an ""I know you"" handout. I think that startups often just go to the connection they have first because its the first place they think of, and VCs picks them up if they are a good idea like any other start up. If we found consistently bad startups which were made by connections then this gentleman's claims may hold weight. I think that this VC will likely find himself turning down many good connection startups by believing that they're doing good and being fair. Its tough to break into any industry, and a connection helps, but only as exposure, not sway toward automatic capital. Exposure shouldn't be taken as a handicap to other start ups. If the startups without many connections have a good idea the interns in VC firms will notice them in not very long and forward the idea to their boss. That or they can apply to Ycom. The point is that this is a pure enough industry that the door doesn't close after the first 10 startups get funding, and those first ten will be judged just like the next 20 or 30 because there's no VC deadline every year (first come first served on applies when there are first in a time frame. No time frame, no firsts). Any VC that doesn't is handicapping themselves or using a different business model.
(Mind the poor english. Its nap time where I am. Also, this article seems to conflict with Ycom's systems, but it doesn't. People that would have had connections just apply to Ycom like everyone else. If anything Ycom has found an effective way of increasing their scope unlike this VC which limited their scope to startups they don't know.)",1301497268

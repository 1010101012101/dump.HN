Obviously, biology differs between the sexes. It’s not at all controversial, under the umbrella of feminism and gender studies, to explore the influence of brain chemistry in the assignment and acceptance of gender roles. Few will dispute that hormones affect the expression of, say, aggression and empathy, <i>on average</i> characteristic of men and women respectively.<p>The more pressing and socially current matter is how these differences (rooted in biology or not) are respected or disrespected by institutions, including the social institutions of our prevailing cultural norms. For example: is it fair to demand that female scientists jockey for position in academia as ruthlessly as male scientists are accustomed to doing? Would it not benefit us if our scientific institutions were more accepting of “non-masculine” approaches to research, however those might be defined?<p>In short, the argument is for accepting diversity, not blindly insisting on exact sameness between genders. That’s also why feminists will argue there’s no such thing as the “truly unbiased test” you seek: testing, by attempting to quantify the qualitative (scientific aptitude), will naturally privilege the testmaker’s perspective to the exclusion of alternatives. I think there’s room to argue that science would benefit from encouraging a diversity of perspectives.",1275976758

Is it because of domain squatting, and if so, don't you think they might have a point?<p>> What irritates me is those preaching about how bad something is without ever being able to offer a better solution other than one that would suit them.<p>Would it make sense for someone to offer a solution that <i>didn't</i> suit them? There could be lots of potential solutions, but I'm not sure we agree on what the problem is.<p>They could release all obviously squatted/parked domains, for example, and prevent or limit their programmatic reservation. I wouldn't mind an increase in price either, if it made squatting unprofitable, or there could be some requirements for reserving a domain.<p>> They all simply want more for themselves, it's not this perceived injustice that you couldn't get the domain you wanted is a bigger issue. It's not. It's simply your greed.<p>Heh. So now wanting a domain is the same as being greedy? Or is it greedy to want a domain that happens to be squatted? Either way, your comment didn't make any sense.<p>> Of course you will want to turn that around and say it's me being greedy.<p>Greedy? Most people are, but greed is not really the problem here - it's what you do.<p>> I've paid large sums for domain names and guess what... I know how to earn more money from it.<p>I'm sure you do. It's much easier to make money when you have no shame or morals.<p>> Welcome to capitalism, quit your bitching and play the game or shut up.<p>Yes, I'm sure you'll continue doing what you do.",1275976305

The first few were tricky, because you're not yet ""wired"" to only see the red ones. Then it gets easy, and after 10 or so you get bored.

This is a small bird eye view on about my so called entrepreneur life for the past 500 fruitful startup days.<p>I started off young, way back from the college -with the fire in the belly-reading the kickass notes from Google Story,inspiring TED talks of Bill,Steve...<p>My god's are obv. billgates, zuckenberg ,ev and zappos.<p>I find my entrepreneur life as an evolutionary process.<p>I started with a dream,just a dream,to dream big.I found a team,fair enough to give me wings to fly.I found angels who seems god sent coz they were only the one willing to help me when i started off.<p>My life seems to evolve,from the mistakes i make,the lessons i learn and the curves that i pass through.I am a small startup hero,who is struggling each day to meet my meals.<p>I too was looking to raise more funds for survival. I too had met a lot of investors.<p>Bechtolsheim reportedly wrote the check to ""Google Inc"" prior to the company even being founded. I bet, this can never happen in India.<p>But unfortunately, I felt that Indian investement scenario are far different from the silicon valley's.<p>Nobody give money unless we have a strong clear cut business plan, cashflow and lot more.<p>I found money on FFF's(Friends,Fools & Family).<p>I bet you do the same-Beg,borrow or steal.This is the only liquid cash you can depend on.<p>We cant blame VC's in India,<p>Each day they find themselves on the redstreet to get them treated.<p>Tons of business plans ,cashflows,business cards,meetings and more flooding on their inbox.<p>They may look at each, they may say hi, but they can bed only with the best.<p>Some VC's says this- Entrepreneurs lifestyle = Whore (bootstrap) > Slut (post-angel) > Prostitute (post VC) > Socialite (post IPO).<p>I couldn’t agree more!<p>These days, I have a small prayer in my mind each time i woke up from dream.<p>“Ohh god,please give me more customers on track.<p>Ohh god,please get me some cashflow.<p>Ohh god,im ditching the vc's.<p>Ohh god,im bootstrapping.<p>Ohh god,please make me strong.”<p>Im a man with many important titles-a bluffmaster in front of media, a prostitute in front of vc's, a father in front of my team.<p>My God is only the customer, whom i worship each day.<p>""I am a dreamer, a fool who dares to dream the dream and foolish to make em come true!""<p>I never use to write blogs/articles.

The ""first mover advantage"" is a myth. In most industries, those who we recognize as the ""first movers"", weren't. They were just the first to achieve sufficient mind/market share. Others have written extensively about this. Google it, if you don't believe me.<p>2. Contrary to popular belief, competition is good. It establishes to customers and other investors that someone else thinks there is value in the market you are seeking to develop.<p>3. The competition that you view as ""overwhelming"" may in fact be a paper tiger. They may falter, you may out execute.  Their strengths are also potential weaknesses. They are beholden to investors and employees, which makes them potentially less nimble. You are beholden to no one, and can potentially be more able to respond to new opportunities or uncovered risks.<p>4. Your respective offerings may end up targeting different segments of the market, and not as direct competitors. You may even end up as partners, either via contract or outright acquisition/merger.<p>5. If they are successful in carving out a market and generating publicity, other investors/acquirers will be looking for others with similar offerings to invest in/acquire. Even ""failed"" companies can be profitable to their stakeholders, if they are run smartly.<p>That being said, it is also important to know that if you are going to fail, fail quickly and move on. You have only one finite resource, and that is time. Don't waste it.<p>But - I'm going to reemphasize this so as not to end on a ""downer"" - don't be so fast to concede defeat just because you are faced with a little bit of competition. After all, look at the Friendster-LinkedIn-MySpace-Facebook saga.",1275974011

(Or as 4chan'ers will call this new multi-corporate-entity: ""new FAAG"".)<p>Exciting!! The kind of software just around the corner makes you want to nerd rage, amirite? I mean, can you imagine, by 2020, we will still be writing HTML, CSS, JS, arguing about browser standards and Canvas2, while struggling against the Telco's crippled, quicksand-slow network speed, and juggling an ever changing incestuous brood of gatekeepers who hoard our data to scrape pennies from the advertising equivalent of the world's biggest penny cup. 2020, welcome to 2010. ""Innovation"" is the biggest weasel word in software.<p>Most new software is going to be an incrementally trivial variant of something you've already seen, probably decades ago. And it's all because we've nearly reached the inflection point of ""peak hardware."" Like the prescient chief of the US patent office back in the 1800's, I will now modestly paraphrase and state that 99% of all software that could ever be invented has already been invented. The rest is just ""filling in holes."" Caveat #1: that hardware doesn't break out and improve at a faster rate than software for the next few decades. Caveat #2: it may not even be possible to quantify ""the rate of improvement of software compared to hardware.""<p>You want to get me excited by some software? Show it to me but running orders of magnitude faster than everything before it could. All that matters at this point is better hardware because the software doesn't have much more room to radically change.<p>I know that 'round these parts daring to ask ""what's in the software startup kool-aid?"" gets down votes. But I don't really care about becoming the biggest, most profitable ad-spammer in the world, nor video chat, nor overvalued and pointless web startups, nor browser animation recreating the state of the art from the 80's, nor the ability to play CD-ROM multimedia content, or Apps, or whatever you want to call them this decade. (This is the part where you get off my lawn.)<p>The only thing that can prevent software from ending up in its own post-apocalyptic ""Nuclear Winter"" of suburban doom is a big bump up on the hardware:<p>a) better batteries.<p>b) more ram.<p>c) faster CPU.",1275973301

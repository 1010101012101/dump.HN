I think probably equivalent to an introductory undergraduate class.  This is perfect for me because my formal calculus and statistics skills have a atrophied in the 10 years since I took those classes in college. The pace is enough to push be to get back into math shape and learn some base algorithms used in ML applications.  I have bookmarked this for follow up since I have a practical need to get deeper into ML.",1385906353

6827273,comment,6827077,6827077,56,0,pyalot2,,,"> In this sense, Bitcoins is not a Ponzi scheme. It is simply a supermoney scheme.<p>Admits that bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme in his own article.<p>> The money was siphoned off from the beginning. Somebody owned a good percentage of the original digits.<p>Implies that most bitcoins are owned by satoshi nakamoto, without substantiating this claim by any number to quantify the impact. The estimated stash of satoshi is about 1 million bitcoins: <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/6/4295028/report-satoshi-nakamoto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/6/4295028/report-satoshi-naka...</a> . Today 11 million bitcoins are in existence. There will be an eventual cap at 21 million bitcoins, so satoshis stash is somewhere between 9% to 4% of all bitcoins. By comparision the winkelvii own about 1% of all bitcoins. I&#x27;m not qualifying the risk this presents, but I think it&#x27;s important for an accurate critique to provide quantification.<p>> Money develops out of market exchanges. Money is the product of the market process. It arises out of an unplanned, decentralized process. This takes time. It takes a lot of time. It spreads slowly, Money has continuity of value. This is not intrinsic value. It is historic value.<p>These statements are provided by the author to explain the nature of money. Note that they do not contradict bitcoin, except perhaps in the haphazard and sometimes too fast adoption. However, the statement about the duration of the establishment of a monetary system derives largely from theory that was wholly written before there where computers or the internet. Historical observation cannot be a good guide when circumstances changed radically.<p>> Now let us look at bitcoins. The market value of one bitcoin has gone from about $2 to $1,000 in a year. This is not money.<p>Volatility != Money, I find this a weak argument. Substantial volatility can manifest itself in established currency markets as well.<p>The remainder of the &quot;critisism&quot; of this author basically boils down to &quot;It can&#x27;t be, because I say so. Perhaps best exemplified by this statement:<p>> In other words, bitcoins cannot possibly fulfill their supposed purpose: to serve as an unregulated currency unit.<p>Author offers scant real critisism beyond the observation that bitcoin is very volatile. Nobody is debating this fact. Nobody is objecting to the assertion that bitcoins, due to their volatility, are a difficult medium to use for exchange.<p>Sadly, author is missing an opportunity to examine what other prospects and drawbacks bitcoins have beyond a simple discussion of the nature &quot;it&#x27;s so volatile, you&#x27;re crazy&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be possible to kickstart something entirely new, which has a massive potential as a technology, and not go trough phases of substantial volatility (many disruptive tech startups valuation goes trough phases of massive volatility, for instance like the early history of Microsoft). Now it&#x27;s possible that this dooms bitcoin. However, it could be argued that if bitcoin didn&#x27;t reward early adopters, and if it didn&#x27;t had massive potential, which would invite the eventual hypes and busts and massive volatility, then it would linger forver in an obscure niche appreciated in it&#x27;s abstract beauty by crypto and math geeks alone.<p>I think it&#x27;s laudable to try, even if you don&#x27;t succeed. But if you don&#x27;t try, you&#x27;re guaranteed to not succeed.",1385906329

It&#x27;s not beyond engineering technology of the era.<p>When people purchased bunkers post-cold-war, they were confronted with &quot;permanent sealed&quot; doors that cannot be opened within the bunkers. These are welded shut and the ports on the door filled with concrete so that it filled whatever was behind. You can go and see these at Kelvedon Hatch in Essex and could previously see these at Ash Radar Station in Kent (before thebunker.net bought it). Each of these doors is closest to the &quot;London side&quot; of things.

Sure, bitcoin has several terrible characteristics that have been exposed over the past few weeks (volatility, tons of speculation, new users don&#x27;t understand wallet security, etc.)<p>But to insinuate with absolutely zero understanding that the creators of bitcoin did this to get rich is just plain nasty. Maybe they did want to get rich (in dollar terms) but there is nothing obvious on the block chain that proves that they cashed out. The argument seems to be that they can&#x27;t cash it all out so they are waiting for something. Well, they haven&#x27;t cashed anything out yet as far as anyone who looks at the block chain can tell. It&#x27;s already possible to cash out $5-$10MM easily over bitstamp which would represent a fraction of their holdings. Why not do that and make sure your future is taken care of? At least that?<p>Furthermore, for several years it did not look like bitcoins were going anywhere. However, the people behind it continued to work on it, and still continue to do so, but under much new pressure because suddenly they are evil ponzi dealers.<p>Applying old school economics and psychology is great, but I must ask this question. What kind of value appreciation did gold see when people suddenly for no reason decided that it was worth a lot? Following this value appreciation did people not use it as a means of exchange as well as a store of value? Why can&#x27;t bitcoin be thought of as gold 2.0? We started valuing dollars, pounds, euros, airplanes, cars, oil, and those didn&#x27;t exist for much of human history.<p>Bitcoin isn&#x27;t like something we&#x27;ve ever seen before and that includes Ponzi schemes.

Most EDA tools are crap at DRC (static rules that only cover geometry and physical connections) and user experience.

It&#x27;s getting progressively better, but wading through hundreds and thousands of warning and info messages is not exactly the most effective way to tell an engineer that something <i>might</i> be wrong. Sure, you can write scripts, but the tools are shit out-of-the-box in finding problems <i>and communicating them to the engineer</i>. This is one example, but they&#x27;re equally bad at guiding the engineer to good design practices that reduces faults, as I think they should.<p>Circuit design tools are worse, and engineers must rely on their experience and keen eye for detail. Some engineers don&#x27;t have one or both of those. Are they sloppy? Can&#x27;t the tools be more intelligent to help?<p>I think that there is a lot to improve in this domain, and I&#x27;m trying to do that with PCBmodE.

Anything in the system/bootup can update a PCR, revoking some or all access to essential keys.<p>Take the chromebook I am using right now. The user can disable secureboot (which isn&#x27;t actually implemented with the TPM) and use an unsigned image, but can not create an image signed by themselves.<p>With either boot, I nominally have control of the TPM, so far so good. But the PCR values written by the boot process will be different so I can not use keys from one boot in the other. For example, my encrypted filesystems from the google boot are inaccessible.<p>This is great for the security of my data if my chromebook is stolen. But it also means a web service like my companies&#x27; VPN or MPAA&#x27;s movie server could demand that I use attestment to show I am using a google configured chromebook, if I did a custom boot the attestment will not have the right PCR values, so I am incapable of using the service.<p>> TPMs aren&#x27;t needed to provide a DRM scenario - UEFI Secure Boot can do that by itself, right?<p>AFAIK, UEFI secure boot limits the device based on a list of public keys, but has no access to any form of secret key.

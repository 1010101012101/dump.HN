60160,comment,60109,60109,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There's math behind the ""If half the people don't say 'fuck you', you're charging too little"" principle.  If you double your prices, you're taking in twice as much revenue.  You can afford to lose half your customers, and you'll still be making the same amount.  However, you'll spend half as much energy doing so.<p>It's more striking if you have overhead.  Say you charge $5000 for some job, but have expenses of $4000 for it.  If you double your prices, you now make $10K, but your expenses remain constant at $4K.  Your profit has gone from $1K to $6K.  You could afford to lose 5/6 of your customers and still break even.<p>My mom charges $80/hour for elementary-school tutoring, up about $10-15/hr from when she started tutoring.  None of her clients have ever blinked at a price increase.  I know 20-somethings who tutor high-school math and make over $100/hr.",1190864918

He's right that black-box tests wouldn't catch it.  But, obviously someone wrote some special-case logic for formatting 65535 and 65536, and there's absolutely no reason that that special case logic should be there.  That code should have been flagged during code review and terminated with extreme prejudice.",1190864831

60149,comment,60018,60018,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Dangerously speculative? The severity of recessions has shown a downward trend since the 1970s. Milder downturns is largely attributable to better monetary policy.<p>If Greenspan should be nailed to the wall for anything, it is for stabbing social security in the back by cheerleading Bush's tax cuts and priming inflation by throwing the budget massively into deficit. These costs are going to be borne by US consumers for a long-time.<p>The problems Greenspan has engendered has everything to do with his personal ideological bent and nothing to do with the role the Fed plays in the national economy (in that capacity, he did his job excellently). As someone who enjoys eating, I'm glad his successor is keeping the economy from a liquidity crisis.\n",1190863374

My day job folks just asked me if I would be willing to relocate, and I've been considering it.

60144,comment,59764,59764,0,0,Goladus,,,"Definitely note that point he made about it being his experience with the software industry.  Other areas you often have no f-ing clue what format is expected.  Sometimes application processes are bizarrely complex.  Cornell, for example, lets you apply to multiple positions, and lets you update your resume and cover letter, but doesn't tell you what exactly gets sent to the relevant parties.  That is, it's not exactly clear whether you're allowed one authoritative version, or if your current 'live' resume gets forwarded to the reviewers when you click submit.  <p>At least, that's what it was like a year ago.  <p>A lot of places just say ""email a resume"" and don't specify whether they mean send an ""email resume"" or an ""email with a word doc attached"" or an ""email with a text resume attached"" or ""html-email"" or ""email with html attachment"" or ""pdf.""  You just have to guess.  I typically would send a rich text, informal email cover letter with a few lines, then I'd attach the resume as html and word doc.\n",1190863076

This is very obvious. What is the benefit of finding new music on iTunes/Pandora? It's the same thing! Of course it's for comfort and delight. That's what you're supposed to be pursuing in life.<p>IMDB does not recommend movies at all. If it does, it does it horrifically badly because it has never helped me before. IMDB is not a recommendation engine, it's simply a database. And they don't seem to want to innovate beyond that.<p>Video stores are enormous and movies are ordered alphabetically by genre. There is no way to know which movie is good, or which one you will like, because all you have is a promotional paragraph on the back and a pretty picture on the front. This is also very obvious to me.",1190862421

60133,comment,58025,58025,0,0,brianfrank,,,"This is great! I just wrote a similar essay on <a href=""http://blog.openconceptual.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.openconceptual.com/</a> proposing a 'philosophy of enterprise,' which also served as an introduction to the work of Alfred North Whitehead -- a philosopher with a mathematical background who wasn't fooled by the supposed certainty of abstractions:<p>""Philosophy has been misled by the example of mathematics; and even in mathematics the statement of the ultimate logical principles is beset by difficulties, as yet insuperable. The verification of a rationalistic scheme is to be sought in its general success, and not in the peculiar certainty, or initial clarity, of its first principles.""\n""The position of metaphysics in the development of culture cannot be understood without remembering that no verbal statement is the adequate expression of a proposition.""<p>Whitehead (who was an early collaborator of Russell's) made these statements while Wittgenstein was a schoolteacher and Russell was still enthralled with his early work, which W. himself later rejected in favour of the ideas he is now (justly) celebrated for.<p>Whitehead's lack of a legacy in professional philosophy is partly due to the fact that he felt it was nevertheless necessary to articulate a sort of heuristic metaphysical framework -- which few professional philosophers have been interested in tangling with [actually, it's been pretty roundly criticized; I meant that philosophers aren't interested in countering or improving it] (for reasons PG points out in the essay).<p>By making such an attempt, he has much in common with Heidegger, who has remained more widely read and cited than Whitehead perhaps (for another reason pointed out by PG) because of his esoteric and unclear style. It's as if James Joyce and Kurt Godel both composed universal cosmologies: whose do you think would be more popular among later generations of young philosophers?<p>Whitehead also agreed with PG's attitude towards Aristotle's impractical metaphysics: ""Metaphysics is nothing but the description of the generalities which apply to all the details of practice.""<p>I think PG's ""test of utility"" has potential, but I think we should be careful not to let it stray too far into an authoritative stance. (... while I try not to stray into ""word soup."") What I mean is that, above all, we should be doing philosophy for ourselves but with others, in conversation. We may not get them to ""do something differently,"" but if we can get them to do something with us (like discuss philosophy, as PG's essay has so effectily done here...), then we've done enough (for the moment). I think if we start believing our ideas are for other people's benefit -- that we somehow appreciate their needs and wants better than they do -- we get into hazardous situations of resentment and (ironically) competition.<p>My favourite ""test of the value of any philosophy"" (quoting John Dewey) is Dewey's question, ""Does it end in conclusions which, when they are referred back to ordinary life-experiences and their predicaments, render them more significant, more luminous to us, and make our dealings with them more fruitful?""<p>That is roughly a more general formulation of PG's test -- only without the requirement of having someone else read it --  which (correct me if I'm wrong) sort of demonstrates PG's proposal: it was useful in getting me to act differently (or at least getting me to act), which I did by ""cranking up the generality"" -- to apply not just to written philosophies but any kind of idea or insight. (Now we wait and see how useful my [I mean Dewey's] philosophy is...)<p>And I fully agree with the last comment: we're just beginning to learn.",1190862058

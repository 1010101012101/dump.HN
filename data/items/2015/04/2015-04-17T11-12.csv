It&#x27;s good enough for me 99% of the time, and if it isn&#x27;t, I normally want to be debugging somewhere other than a chat app.<p>What Slack does very well is giving a good enough experience for programmers to do shop-talk, and ample opportunities for chatbot yak-shaves, it&#x27;s also perfectly well usable for non technical people. I work for $ENORMOCORP, and after a couple of brave pioneers among the tech people, now everyone&#x27;s falling over themselves to get their teams a Slack instance. (As others have said here, the ability to have multiple instances is pretty fundamental to this dynamic - we have team-specific Slacks, product specific, project specific and what have you. I certainly would not want some more &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; colleagues seeing that NSFW bollocks people keep wiring into the tech specific chatbots...)<p>This strikes me as a pattern with some potential for growth - tech people driving adoption among non-technical colleagues.

Exactly one reason:<p>1) Physical Proximity - nearly all investors will only consider you if you can pitch them physically in-person. This is the source of the great inefficiency in equal access to capital for everyone in the world. Note: you&#x27;ll have to physically be there long enough to become friends with the introducers, since most investors don&#x27;t allow you to approach them directly.<p>> But it&#x27;s hard to get money in any country, rich countries have more competition<p>Absolutely not true.

Not 3 to 6 months and dozens of meetings for every single investor, as is often the convention in EU. Competition for speed between investors is hugely beneficial to the entrepreneur, in this case.<p>2) Almost no cities in the world, except for a couple, have tons of rich, active angel investors who themselves got rich by starting tech startups.<p>3) The incredible density of founders and investors within certain places is 1000x greater than the lesser cities. This speed and efficiency of being able to see dozens of investors per week with nearly zero overhead helps enormously. The density of each investor being able to immediately introduce you to several more has an exponential compounding effect.<p>I found these to be a good intro as to why not all cities are created equally.

Who you are is about your character, your person, your choices, and your integrity.  The only way the outer world changes your inner person is when you allow it.  Its ability to change you stops the minute you decide to stop helping it to do so.  Nobody is broken, some people quit.<p>It is good that you feel like a worthless failure.  You are likely too young and ignorant to realize how valuable this is.<p>Great results come from great decisions and great work.
Great decisions and great work come from the mind and will, and are learned by experience.
Experience comes from making decisions and actions and learning from them.
If you have nothing, then you have learned something.  If you have learned something then you have nothing.<p>You can choose to think through where you are and what you are doing and learn the most, to understand the most, to get fuel for the engine of your willpower, or you can let it pass by like an invisible and silent locomotive an inch away from your face.  What happens now is the consequences of your actions now.  Your actions now are the consequence of your choices.  You are not a product of your past.  You are not the squeezings of your circumstances.<p>If you want to be successful in business, then understand what value is, and return it to the customer.  If you always return more value to the customer than they lose through the sales price, then you will always have customers.<p>The world, though it looks like it is solid and complete, is like a sponge, like enormous swiss cheese - it is dense with holes.  Each hole is a place where value can be returned.  Find one.  Fill it.<p>Money isn&#x27;t the goal.  It isn&#x27;t the goal of capitalists or plutocrats.  It is paper - it burns.  It has no fundamental value.  All the engines of industry and finance in the world are an expression of human failure to handle value healthily in the context of community.  Unlike you they are not broken - so they can never learn and never change what they are doing.  They are too poor to have that wisdom.<p>Never blindly walk down the road.  Take good wisdom based on good vision, and walk down that road.  If you are going to make a startup - 90% fail in the first year.  Go into it knowing that it will fail.  The second startup success rate is better than 50%.  The third startup is upwards of 80%.  Find the best value you can create and create it for people.  Even if you fail once or twice, you fail doing something noble, something worth having done it.  Even in &quot;failure&quot;, in &quot;defeat&quot; in having done something great you get not only the learning, but the having done something worth doing.  The defeat gives you two of the most meaningful measures of victory.<p>Read wisdom.  Epictetus.  Marcus Aurelius.  How to live on 24 hours a day.  Make a log of your time and be brutally honest.  Know your budget of time - where it goes.  Truth allows you to allocate it in improved ways.  Watch Randy Pausch - the last lecture.  Live life well.  You only get a few days till it is done, and in death every victory that can be taken away is.  The ones you keep in your heart and soul - those are not taken away because that part of the person is immortal.",1429270593

Some of the perps were the people running the services. He&#x27;s probably also heard about the Silk Road. When it comes down to it he probably doesn&#x27;t have a clue about computer security so there&#x27;s no way in hell he&#x27;s going to keep his cash on his own computer in a file he could lose with a hard-drive crash, that a hacker could steal from an infected machine.

Yes, it disproportionally affected Jews, but it also affected a lot of non-Jews (as well as people who did not self-identify as Jews). Presenting it as a purely Jewish tragedy is disrespectful to all the non-Jewish victims.<p>The more important thing is that it was about <i>humans</i>. Humans did these things to other humans. You should not feel any better about what happened if you&#x27;re not personally related to any of those who caused the suffering than you should feel any less offended if you&#x27;re not personally related to those who suffered.<p>The Holocaust was a failure of humanity. As was every single genocide before and after that particular one. Turning it into a &quot;Nazis killing Jews&quot; story allows us to artificially distance ourselves from what happened: &quot;I&#x27;m not a Nazi, so why should I care?&quot; or &quot;I have nothing against Jews, so what does it have to do with me?&quot; (&quot;I only hate gay people&quot;).<p>In Germany we have a huge problem with this. We pretend to have dealt with our history, but we vehemently oppose the idea that the &quot;monsters&quot; who committed that &quot;great evil&quot; were normal human beings. As if that would somehow make them innocent. It does quite the opposite, actually: acknowledging that it was &quot;just&quot; humans doing those things to humans can help us understand what made ordinary humans &quot;like us&quot; end up doing something that horrible to other ordinary humans.<p>We&#x27;re actually seeing something similar with East Germany: because everybody knows East Germany was an &quot;Unrechtsstaat&quot; (literally the opposite of a &quot;Rechtsstaat&quot;, or &quot;state of law&quot;, but also implying &quot;organized injustice&quot;) <i>their</i> mass surveillance and censorship was fundamentally different from <i>our</i> mass surveillance and censorship. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing we could learn from them because by definition we&#x27;re nothing like them and any attempt to portray East German life as anything other than constant suffering and oppression &quot;trivializes&quot; the injustice of its government.<p>Creating taboos around these problems doesn&#x27;t solve them, it just hides them. The US hasn&#x27;t solved its racism just because the current president has darker skin. Acknowledging physiological differences between sexes or even ethnic groups isn&#x27;t sexist or racist.

Why try to get by with what you currently have when you can just take what your neighbor has? In some cases it&#x27;s just cheaper to go beat someone up and get their lunch money than to earn your own.<p>Junger is saying that war is really emergent behavior: young men are violent, so they are not just willing to go to war, but want to. It&#x27;s certainly a new perspective to me. I suppose it makes some sense, though it feels to me that wars today are &quot;not what they used to be&quot;. Take WWI and WWII. There was mass draft and the country was generally behind these. I am sure there was a great number of people who were unhappy to be drafted, but it seems that here people actually believed in the existential threat to the US.<p>Then take the Vietnam war. Hugely unpopular. Look at this widely circulated picture of a lighter supposedly carried by a US soldier in Vietnam: <a href=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/10/article-2171404-14002534000005DC-124_306x423.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/10/article-2171404-14...</a>.<p>Now, today our military is volunteer-based and tiny compared to, say, what it was during WWII. Only a small percentage of the population serves, and are pre-selected. Is it then fair to say that all or even most young men want to go to war? It seems to me the answer is no.<p>So the remaining question is whether war happens because of this emergent behavior or for other reasons.

After someone dies, there’s a 49-day mourning period that involves elaborate, carefully orchestrated rituals. “It is better than any antidepressant,” Tshewang Dendup, a Bhutanese actor, told me. The Bhutanese might appear detached during this time. They are not. They are grieving through ritual.<p>That actually sounds like a great idea.

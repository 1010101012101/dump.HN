104771,comment,104716,104716,0,0,thorax,,,"I like the layout of the site, but you have an uphill battle. Most sites I've seen that go this way are all ad and scam-- it's very hard for people to push past that. Your site doesn't feel like that now, but you might want to tone it down a little on the graphics. I think being as subtle and simple as possible might help people take the site a little seriously-- you're fighting against some difficult stereotypes and every little bit helps.<p>Best of luck!",1201388762

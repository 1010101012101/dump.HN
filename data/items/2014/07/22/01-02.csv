8067092,comment,8064534,8064958,12,0,gambler,,,"In complex systems low-level efficiency is far less beneficial than high-level efficiency. To achieve high-level efficiency you need to have a clear understanding of how the system works as a whole. That is impossible is the code is unintelligible bag of tricks.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this a lot when working in PHP. I wrote some websites from ground-up (using something similar to my own framework). I optimized int multiple times to great results. The biggest benefits didn&#x27;t come from making a particular function faster, they came from realizations that large chunks of complexity in templating, routing and permissions checking subsystems simply weren&#x27;t necessary. It doesn&#x27;t matter how clever those chunks were written, because I got rid of them completely.<p>I think this is what the author speaks about.",1405994343

This surge of energy could come from the battery, but the battery is empty so it won&#x27;t work correctly<p>- Having some amount of battery means the phone can soft-off correctly when the plug is removed suddenly. The alternative is an un-expected hard off which is usually bad.

And that demo got us to the moon:<p><i>&quot;Apparently, nobody had yet arrived at any kind of software requirements for the AGC&#x27;s user interface when the desire arose within the Instrumentation Laboratory to set up a demo guidance-computer unit with which to impress visitors to the lab.  Of course, this demo would have to do something, if it was going to be at all impressive, and to do something it would need some software. In short order, some of the coders threw together a demo program, inventing and using the verb/noun user-interface concept, but without any idea that the verb/noun concept would somehow survive into the flight software.  As time passed, and more and more people became familiar with the demo, nobody got around to inventing an improvement for the user interface, so the coders simply built it into the flight software without any specific requirements to do so.&quot;</i>[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ForDummies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/ForDummies.html</a>",1405994053

I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the right book for &quot;level 3&quot; unless you want to be a level-3 who is good at PGMs.<p>The problem with ML is there are so many different kinds. Bishop&#x27;s book is a decent light weight survey, but it doesn&#x27;t come close to covering all the interesting fields. You could read that and Hastie/Tibshirani&#x27;s book and still know almost nothing about online training (hugely important for &quot;big data&quot; and timeseries), reinforcement learning (mentioned, but not in any depth), agent learning, &quot;compression&quot; sequence predicting techniques, time series oriented techniques (recurrent ANNs for starters, but there is a ton to know here, and most interesting data is time ordered), image recognition tools, conformal prediction, speech recognition tools, ML in the presence of lots of noise, and unsupervised learning. I don&#x27;t own PGM, but it probably wouldn&#x27;t help much in these matters either. I know guys who are probably level 4 at machine learning who don&#x27;t know about most of these subjects. On the other hand, Peter Flach&#x27;s book &quot;Machine Learning&quot; at least mentions them and makes pointers to other resources.<p>&quot;Deep learning&quot; is becoming kind of a buzzword for a big basket of tricks. I think it&#x27;s worth knowing about drop-out training, and the tricks used to do semi-supervised learning, but the buzzword is silly. Technically &quot;deep learning&quot; just means &quot;improved gradient descent.&quot; I figure level-4 is anyone making progress coming up with new techniques.<p>That said, reading good books is one way to make progress.

This can help with lots of things, but still has the fundamental disconnect problem you&#x27;ll get at runtime with either approach.<p>A huge problem with the tradeoff we had (well, still have in some areas) is the generated SQL is nasty, and finding the original code it came from is often non-trivial.  Lack of ability to hint queries, control parameterization, etc. is also a big issue when trying to optimize queries. For example we (and by &quot;we&quot; I mean, &quot;I made Marc Gravell do it&quot;) added literal replacement to Dapper to help with query parameterization which allows you to use things like filtered indexes.  In dapper we also intercept the SQL calls to dapper and add add exactly where it came from. Here&#x27;s what that looks like, replicate for the other methods:<p><pre><code>    public static IEnumerable<T> Query<T>(this DataContext db, SqlBuilder.Template template, bool buffered = true, int? commandTimeout = null, IDbTransaction transaction = null, [CallerFilePath]string fromFile = null, [CallerLineNumber]int onLine = 0, string comment = null)\n    {\n        using (db.Connection.EnsureOpen())\n        {\n            return SqlMapper.Query<T>(db.Connection, MarkSqlString(template.RawSql, fromFile, onLine, comment), template.Parameters as object, transaction ?? db.Transaction, buffered, commandTimeout);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd here&#x27;s the our marking method tailored for our code, but you get the idea:<p><pre><code>    private static string MarkSqlString(string sql, string path, int lineNumber, string comment)\n    {\n        if (path.IsNullOrEmpty() || lineNumber == 0)\n        {\n            return sql;\n        }\n\n        var commentWrap = &quot; &quot;;\n        var i = sql.IndexOf(Environment.NewLine);\n\n        // if we didn&#x27;t find \\n, or it was the very end, go to the first space method\n        if (i < 0 || i == sql.Length - 1)\n        {\n            i = sql.IndexOf(&#x27; &#x27;);\n            commentWrap = Environment.NewLine;\n        }\n\n        if (i < 0) return sql;\n\n        // Grab one directory and the file name worth of the path\n        //   this dodges problems with the build server using temp dirs\n        //   but also gives us enough info to uniquely identify a queries location\n        var split = path.LastIndexOf(&#x27;\\\\&#x27;) - 1;\n        if (split < 0) return sql;\n        split = path.LastIndexOf(&#x27;\\\\&#x27;, split);\n\n        if (split < 0) return sql;\n\n        split++; // just for Craver\n\n        var sqlComment = &quot; /* &quot; + path.Substring(split) + &quot;@&quot; + lineNumber + (comment.HasValue() ? &quot; - &quot; + comment : &quot;&quot;) + &quot; */&quot; + commentWrap;\n\n        return sql.Substring(0, i) +\n               sqlComment +\n               sql.Substring(i);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis results in a comment at the top of the query like this:<p><pre><code>    /* Models\\Post.LinkedQuestions.cs@105 */ \n    select top (@top) \n           p.Id \n         , p.Title\n         , p.Score\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s such a simple approach using the caller member attributes, but it saves so much time tracking things down.",1405992795

At this point, you convert to UTF-16 to for O(1) random access.<p>Indexing characters in a localized string is rarely useful to applications and often denotes a bug (did they want the N-th grapheme, glyph or code-point?). It&#x27;s best to use higher-level primitives for collating, concatenating and splitting localized text.<p>Granted, a JavaScript interpreter must remain bug-by-bug compatible with existing code, thus precluding some of the most aggressive optimizations.",1405991247

Made donations to a ton of services and people, mainly open source projects, web comics and such. Also donated to wikipedia, wikileaks, eff and a few others. That's all that comes to mind right now.",1219924706

289042,comment,287927,288076,0,0,shiro,,,"Some graphics applications (like 3D modeling package) have pie-chart like menu system; for example, if you type SPACE, an overlayed menu appears around the mouse cursor and just moving a mouse a bit to that direction and release SPACE triggers that item (you don't even click).<p>Watching the experienced users using that interface is just amazing.  They don't read the menu items; they know which direction is what by heart, probably in muscle memory.",1219924416

As education (A) increases, knowledge (B) and ""things you know you don't know"" (C) increase on approximately the same curve. I'd say that A:C grows slowly at first, then gets steep, while A:B is roughly linear.",1219924300

289034,comment,288168,288794,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I just read the WSJ story on this, and the venture firms typical investments differed from the Photobucket investment. Photobucket was much smaller than their usual portfolio companies and needed much less money than the venture firm usually gave.

We have companies competing for a finite amount of customers (or customers' attention).<p>If you had five equally popular search engines, they wouldn't really compete prices down anyway. The number of searches (supply) would still be the same & advertisers (demand) would still be the same.<p>The only reason MSN & Yahoo (not to mention real obscure engines) still earn less per click is a sort of market imperfection: It's complicated & time consuming learning another system & running parallel campaigns. For an extra 5-10%, it isn't worth it for small campaigns.<p>Monopoly or not, they are not manipulating the market. It manipulates itself.",1219923492

If you're unsure, you might do well to review those topics before approaching machine learning (or at least keep good references handy). (Edit: the link above has Section Notes that review probability theory, linear algebra, and convex optimization. You might find those useful.)<p>And it's not an easy course. Don't be discouraged if the problem sets seem impossible. (They very nearly are.)",1195018280

Because I'm not so sure you can just take a comparison like this and make it equate. Unlike in the Era of PCs, there are already quite a few established smartphone OSes. DOS had relatively smaller competition in terms of personal computer OSes. Theres linux based OSes now, then of course the Apple, Palm OS actually is still alive somewhat, then Win Mobile. Its still a different ballgame. And remember that the open handset isn't all inclusive, there are those that havent joined.<p>though not many, so I do see your point. And its a good one. But of course we should know that it doesnt completely equate.",1195017155

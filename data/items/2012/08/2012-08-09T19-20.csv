Perhaps not rational, but humans are not inherently rational beings.<p>The authors thought ""Lend my book to a friend? Sure, why not? Good word of mouth always helps!""  A nice, forward thinking perspective.<p>But what LendInk makes possible is for lending to extend beyond normal social connections.  You could go look for any book you wanted, never buy another book again.  And each book would be lent the maximum number of times.  There's a fundamental difference at work there, the dynamic changes considerably.<p>You could say ""Well libraries work the same way!  Buy once, lend forever!""  But libraries are geographically constrained.  And there are a lot of them.  So being able to be lent anywhere in the country still means you sold a lot of books.  It's fundamentally different.<p>So while this site certainly didn't promote piracy and authors were compensated when appropriate, it did subvert the terms they had agreed to, and it did so willfully.<p>I can see where the content creators are coming from there.<p>This is probably a good idea, and probably inevitable and unstoppable. But that doesn't mean it has to be on the same economic terms as the previous model.",1344542396

4362896,comment,4357570,4361863,1,0,tpenzer,,,"I guess I set up my proposal the way I did so that authors could explicitly flag assets as being available or unavailable in 2x in the most convenient way conceivable to me, because it would add inefficiency to force a choice between assuming all assets are available in 2x and that none are, as some requests will fail if they're not all available in 2x. I will mention that for my proposal, if you want to assume all assets are available in 2x, the extent of the work for authors would be to add '<meta image-scaling={2:""@2x""} />' to the page. It is potentially more work than HAIR, but I figured it would pay off with server resource efficiency, accessibility to authors, and powerful flexibility.<p>That said, I could totally get on board with HAIR, assuming my concerns are unfounded (which is likely). How does that system affect server capacity and performance? Is there a significant performance penalty for having the server determine whether each asset is actually available in 2x or not before fulfilling the client's request? Is this information which would automatically be cached, and thus not have a significant impact? Or will each image request have an additional operation to perform?<p>Also, does this system force you to have your 1x and 2x assets share the same exact filename? In the example, are the 1x images in the 'img' directory, and the 2x in 'image' with the same filename? I'm sorry if my confusion is making me ask the wrong questions; maybe evidence of the challenge of explaining this system to clueless people like me.<p>[Upon further review, it looks like an img src link to '/img/bob/' would load the 'index.jpg' file from inside the 'bob' directory by default, and then your system would have it load the 'dpr=2.jpg' file if the client wants that. So this imposes even more stringent file naming and organizing restrictions than I had in mind, and it works nothing like what I thought upon first glance (never knew you could even link to a directory for an image asset, and have it load index.jpg, though it does make sense). I am embarrassed to admit that I'm not completely sure where I'd even put those parameters, though I assume it would be in httpd.conf for apache, or maybe .htaccess otherwise. Also, does this require a separate entry for each image on the site?]",1344542085

I still have the muscle memory for emacs and I've gone back a few times and tried it, but honestly, the configuration was such a pain in the ass. I have .emacs files from long ago, but I tried a few months back bringing it up to date along the lines of TM1 and after about 15 mins, I just said forget it.<p>TM1 out of the box had all my web dev needs already there. Plus, tabs worked great. The only things I've replaced on it over the past few years were search in project (via grep in project) and the file drawer on the left (forget what that plugin was called). Speaking of plugins / bundles - those were super easy to install. For what I needed, they pretty much just always worked.<p>For the OP who said that Textmate didn't deserve its success I say, <i>whatever</i>. Everyone that I worked with over the past 5+ years doing web dev used TM. And NO ONE complained that it got in their way of getting their work done. So, cool, that's your opinion, but I think TM deserved all the success it got - it's helped me make a good amount of money over the past few years and I still use it today.<p>The fact that TM2 is now on Github, that's great. Will anything come of it? Dunno, but I guess I can't blame Alan for putting it on there and maybe moving on. TM1 is almost 8 years old and that's a long time to be beholden to something.

The problems were the same for each student, but we all had different parameters, so our answers would be different.<p>After figuring them all out a few weeks into the semester, I started writing up some BASIC programs on my TI-86 that would take in student's parameters and spit out solutions.

But the numbers show that simple psychology causes a lot of people to open them just to see whats inside.<p>F2P in general is based on the notion that 'if you give someone a reward for something, they will pay for more of that reward'. Alternatively, if you give someone a way to make it easier to ""achieve"" that reward, they will pay you to make it easier. So therefore f2p games are designed around getting you into essentially a skinner box where you get a constant rate of rewards and can either pay to make the reward process easier or you can pay to make it happen more often.<p>The problem with this addiction model is that it puts an incredible amount of stress on your users. These games are not inherently fun, they are just addictive. The stress leads to burn out and players quitting. This is all on a spectrum of course, I would barely categorize TF2 as using this model. Zynga games define this model.<p>Edit:<p>let me tie my last 2 paragraphs to my first. In TF2, you can either get new guns at constant periodic intervals. Or you can pay to get them in crates, which drop fairly often. This is a skinner-box/addiction model. It is a small part of TF2, but Zynga games use this as the basis of their game's design.<p>More and more games and using this model and fall somewhere in between Zynga and Valve. The problem is the slope towards Zynga is steep and its easy to make people buy things if you use Zyngaesque features. This benefits your company in the short term but kills it in the long term.",1344540285

RS232 serial ports) to talk to the Wyse-70 on each employee's desk. 9600 baud taught you to use vi, and use it <i>efficiently</i> -- it took a whole second per screen refresh -- but we had a team of 15 people working productively on that one PC.<p>Yes, we were managing that 30,000 page documentation set using sccs, vi, and troff, with a custom (sco.mac) set of macros that forked off of the Xenix version of man.mac some time back in the 1980s and that had been hacked about to support semantic tagging because ""we're upgrading to SGML next year"" ...",1344539082

Because next to training, I also keep a somewhat busy freelancing schedule.<p>I need the protein for building muscle mass.<p>And I need the fat because fat burns in fat and you can't get leaner without consuming fat.<p>The idea is that you can't digest more than X amount of protein per day anyway (so 20% seems okay), you want fat, but too much fat will amke you fat (so 20% seems okay) and 60% carbs is pretty much what's left.<p>My biggest problem right now is that I don't eat enough carbs, but do eat too much fat. Protein is going pretty well.<p>Because here's the tricky part, once you let go of simple carbs (white flour, processed sugar etc.) it becomes really really really difficult to eat enough carbs. And a lot if not most of high protein foods (especially animal protein) are also high in fat.<p>For instance, an egg is something like 33% protein, 63% fat and 3% carbs.<p>PS: I got the 60-20-20 advice from Scooby -> <a href=""http://scoobysworkshop.com/nutrition/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scoobysworkshop.com/nutrition/</a>",1344539031

The reason we wrote it is because we needed it now for meteor.com, and it wasn't too much engineering work (I think Nick wrote the first version over a weekend, and then it was a couple days of packaging it up).  The reason we released it is, well, why not? :)<p>The ""real solution"" is coming, and we will get it right.  It's connected to URL routing, and sending down initial HTML on page load.  We're all excited for the day when Meteor apps initialize the client session on the server.  It will look at first glance like a traditional server-side app. :)",1344539007

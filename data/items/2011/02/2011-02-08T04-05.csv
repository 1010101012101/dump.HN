For example, will I tickle you lightly or firmly, and in what exact spot? Will I wriggle my fingers? How long will I persist? When we tickle ourselves not only do we know it's coming, but our brain can answer any of those questions, so it's really difficult to not anticipate any resulting sensation.",1297141178

I told him ""good luck in India"" and to give me a call if it didn't work out; while I need the work, I know better than to take clients like that, especially if I have aspirations of scaling to a reasonably-sized firm one day.<p>I've found that most medium-sized companies are practically impenetrable for consultants around here; everyone has a contract with Robert Half, or has a policy against contractors, or doesn't want to pay anything above $50/hr, which is barely acceptable for a <i>single</i> developer, and practically useless to someone trying to run a company.<p>I'd really like to know how I can get my foot in the door somewhere where the client won't balk and I won't feel like I can't charge the full time because the company is always talking about how strapped they are.

The tweet is parsed for mentions, and it is also copied on to the mentionee's incoming timeline and their mentions timeline.<p>The tweet is parsed for hashtags, and active searches (i.e. ones open on twitter.com, or via the APIs) and is also copied onto those timelines.<p>Also, you have followers. So Twitter also copies the tweet onto the inbox timeline of each of your followers.<p>Not only is all this information published in real time on Twitter.com, but it is also made available via JSON API, Streaming API and Firehose API.<p>All tweets (on all timelines) are stored forever.<p>Twitter's scale is hard to fathom - all of this processing is way beyond what your Rails / Django app could process with a MySQL backend. MySQL replication wouldn'e even come close to keeping up with the sheer volume of events to be processed.<p>To make matters more complicated - Twitter is expected to scale to meet the demand of emerging world events (eg: Egypt, Iran, snowstorms, hurricanes, earthquakes, bushfires).

I have a ""DSL"" I wrote at work for decorating functions with various metadata and recurring bits of functionality like permissions checking in Perl for work, but because it's just not-really-even-glorified Perl I still have the full power of Perl to do things like programmatically generate these functions. Using a recurring set of decorations is as easy as sticking them in a bog-standard Perl array and just passing them as bog-standard arguments in the right place.<p>It's tempting to replace your language entirely and compile down to something else, but IMHO this sort of thing shows that's a very dangerous play that generally succeeds big or fails big, usually the latter. Incremental expansion of an existing language, even with something as powerful as a syntax preprocessor (that ideally compiles to results that are themselves manipulable language constructs like closures or simple values passed in an idiomatic way), is generally the way to go; most of the win, hardly any of the risk. Something like StratifiedJS or something, if I understand it properly, adding meaningful additional syntax without trying to be its own independent language: <a href=""http://onilabs.com/stratifiedjs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onilabs.com/stratifiedjs</a> Or, from the sounds of it, the way this language ultimately went.<p>Javascript may not be quite as slick as Ruby, but, well, to be honest I think Ruby partisans really oversell the value of being able to drop a few parentheses out of your code, and while the block syntax may be nicer JS still has relatively decent closures.",1297140067

Often I would get in trouble for missing meetings because the location of the meeting was spread by word of mouth but no one would come by and tell me.  My first project was to port some code written by a much older engineer, but this engineer believed that he had job security if he were the only one who knew the system.  Our boss told him ""You WILL let him shadow you and read your code,"" and he shot back, ""He will NOT shadow me and he will not see my code!""

You're choosing the greater of two goods, so to speak, so it's hard to do something at this stage that will drastically screw up your life.<p>I believe going to college will ultimately open more doors for you than bypassing college to work will. There are things you probably know about right now that you would find interesting but which require a college education. For example, actually working at Apple would almost certainly require a college degree just to get in the door for an interview. That may not be a particular door you'd like to walk through, but the point still stands - by not going to college you are closing that door. Further, part of college involves filling gaps in your knowledge you might not even know exist (so-called 'unknown unknowns'). I took a linguistics course, for example, and find it to be an INCREDIBLY fruitful body of knowledge to draw from as I explain and reason about the world around me. I had no linguistic bent before college, but I am much richer for the knowledge.<p>By working now, you are gaining some good experience, and you're drawing a paycheck (and the numbers are immaterial right now - almost ANY paycheck beats the money the average college kid earns). You're passing up student loans if those are a concern of yours, and in a sense you'll be learning a lot that college won't teach. I don't know enough about the startup versus media firm to have a solid opinion, but you should keep in mind that your age and lack of a college degree will hinder your ability to switch jobs if either company goes Tango Uniform. Further, depending on when that happens, you may be sitting around for a semester waiting to enroll in college if that's what you decide to do.<p>If I were you, I'd find some way to get a college education on something approaching a reasonable time frame. By reasonable, I don't mean four or even five years - I'm thinking closer to seven. If you can keep up work full time while getting that degree, you reap the benefits of both choices at the cost of some of your social life. I did that with grad school and don't feel I missed anything worth experiencing. That said, I'm a modern day Daniel Plainview, meaning I 'tolerate' most people but like very few.

It's important to note that we abandoned (or ""put on hold"") Lunascript, but <i>not</i> Luna. The vision for Luna always revolved around making it easy to write bug-free, real-time, responsive, collaborative, interactive webapps. The syntax of Lunascript over directly using the framework in Javascript was always a nice-to-have.<p>I'm not denying your lesson, of course. To this day we still have some Lunascript in the codebase, and it does create some developer friction that costs real time. In retrospect, I'm sure it seems obvious that we should skipped the language and just built the framework.<p>However, it's important to understand that the language itself was built mostly by Justin very early in the company's history, and basically no work was poured into it after we hired employees and built out the product. One framing of Lunascript is two guys taking a few months to try a few big ideas out before building a company they want to do the right way. We always knew we would have to compromise on ideals once we moved forward, but we wanted to see what stuck. I think a lot of the reason we're under scrutiny here is because people look at the time since D+J left Facebook and are like ""what did you guys do with all that time?""

Anonymous is a political movement that is analogous to the internet immune system.  It self-organizes, and attacks that which it deems a threat to internet freedom.<p>Gene Simmons was attacked because his statements, and his position as a pop star made him a target as a threat.  Like all immune systems, Anonymous is known to overreact.<p>If you look at the targets for Anonymous in terms of political uprisings, you'll notice a concentration of places where the internet played a large role and/or was targeted.  Uprisings occur the world over, but Anonymous gets involved when the internet is threatened.<p>In this sense, the use of the ""V for Vendetta"" mask is a perfect symbol for Anonymous, for anyone who has read the comic book (or even just seen the film adaptation).<p><i>The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.</i><p>V was not so much interested in popular revolt, anarchism, social equality, etc. per se.  He was interested in revenge.  Justice became the ultimate form of revenge against a tyrannical government.<p>You can see that similarly in the actions of Anonymous.  Democratic movements are supported against dictatorships, and transparency is supported against representatives of Democracy.  Not because Anonymous is a positive force for Democracy or transparency, but because those are weapons they can wield against the internet's perceived enemies.<p>So yes, Anonymous is a political movement, although a leaderless, amorphous, and pluralistic one united only in negative political space.  They don't seek to create, as much as destroy their political enemies.  But, as some say, ""the urge to destroy is also a creative urge"".",1297138574

That way if you decide you want to go to a different university, you can usually transfer the AA degree.<p>Keep us updated :)",1297138428

    writing Lunascript for our application code to Javascript. 
    The two main things that were slowing down our development:
    too much remaining research-level work to make the compiler 
    output more performant code
    lack of tool support

    We're *not* a framework company, so we didn't want to devote 
    years to this work at the expense of building our product. We're 
    still using the framework primitives we developed for the 
    language -- most importantly, systems for reactively recomputing     
    our UI and synchronizing changes with the server -- we're just no 
    longer using the slightly nicer syntax (and functional style) 
    that Lunascript provided.

    Long term, we may revive the Lunascript compiler. We think this 
    may be especially appealing once we shift from focusing Asana as 
    a single product to Asana as a platform. But for the immediate 
    future, we're focused on releasing our first product at the 
    expense of continuing work on Lunascript proper.</code></pre>",1297137894

The topics will have to depend on the kinds of people that applied and their interests, but I like the idea of having a beginner group and an advanced group (possibly based on mathematical level).",1297137648

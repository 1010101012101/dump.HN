There is an apocalypse, some external information that you should rely on instead of you intuitive faculties because they are biased and unreliable, but if you follow the path of the leader you&#x27;ll be saved.<p>And another problem is that nobody serious has ever rolled up their sleeves, went through and criticized the whole mess of their Bible (called Climate Science Papers), a massive collection of writings, interlinked thousand-fold in an intricate complex network. Simply because the people who could do this don&#x27;t want to be criticized in the media.<p>Fortunately since the Climategate story came out and we could see the leadership&#x27;s reaction, it was an eye-opener for many people. Still this movement is quite well-spread and gets linked to often by journalists, politicians, etc.</i><p>None of your critiques are remotely specific to lesswrong.

It was my impression that the problems with gentrification are generally of the second type, but your comment makes it sound like this is being done intentionally.<p>In any case, in Amsterdam there&#x27;s a pretty hard limit to how much rent can be increased, particularly for existing tenants. If landlords are free to set rent to whatever they like, it&#x27;s easy to see how that could lead to all sorts of terrible situations.<p>In any case, I think a mixed neighbourhood like the one I live in is pretty much the ideal. The mix of high and low incomes means there&#x27;s money to pay for jobs in shops and restaurants, and people to fill those jobs.

10717355,comment,10714732,10715856,0,0,bane,,,"They build two different, non-overlapping products (or at least they did when I last looked into them about 3 years ago).<p>1) A collaborative semantic graph tool [1] -- this is the thing they&#x27;re best known for. The client tool is a unified interface for both adding new information to the semantic graph as well as searching/exploring what&#x27;s already in the graph. It does this in a way that scales to a fairly large number of simultaneous users and allows organizations to build and explore collective &quot;knowledge&quot;. The input focus is on manually selecting and &quot;tagging&quot; semantic elements in free-text, aligning those with the system&#x27;s ontology framework and even connecting together different semantic elements with certain constrained relationship types. [2] Over time this aggregates into a hihgly curated knowledge-base that can be mined more efficiently than reading lots and lots of reports and news articles.<p>They support a few other odds and ends (maps, various statistical tools on the semantic graph, different search methods). There&#x27;s plenty of other vendors that do parts of this, but Palantir brought excellent user interface design and better collaboration tools to the party.<p>These days, their core semantic graph tech could probably be replicated by half a dozen engineers using HTML5 technology and some sort of scalable hadoop-like back-end in a few months. It&#x27;s not <i>that</i> interesting of a technology. On a personal level, you could do...~70% of what they do with something like yED or Visio. Protege [3] would probably get you another 10% of the way there. A good google docs-style collaboration another 10% and so on. There&#x27;s nothing uniquely revolutionary about the tech other than they brought it together in the right way.<p>My impression is that most of the money they make is on integrating customer data sources into the tool so users have more things to markup and add to the knowledge base. Enterprise integration is a very lucrative and time-consuming job and a competitor&#x27;s quick rewrite (like I mention above) won&#x27;t be able to compete against Palantir&#x27;s entrenched relationship and large marketing teams. This is where <i>most</i> of their engineering resources are going at the moment.<p>2) A &quot;big data&quot; statistical exploration tool meant for finance. [4] I don&#x27;t know much more about it other than they designed a new language for it and if connected up to the right kinds of data sources looked really powerful in the videos I saw of it in action.<p>They have lots of open positions all over the world, which makes me think they have lots of offices all over the world, which means they do lots of sales and marketing globally, penetrating new markets. My guess is that the huge numbers of enormous funding rounds go into marketing pushes into different verticals and locations.<p>They <i>used</i> to have a demo on their website you could play with, but they&#x27;ve taken it down. The tool was nice looking for 2010-ish, but it had a Java JRE requirement that was pretty old and wouldn&#x27;t run on newer runtimes.<p>1 - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f86VKjFSMJE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f86VKjFSMJE</a><p>2 - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-UrRJMDGWc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-UrRJMDGWc</a><p>3 - <a href=""http://protege.stanford.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://protege.stanford.edu/</a><p>4 - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8YMPS_DZPk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8YMPS_DZPk</a>",1449845383

You can of course criticize the mainstream once you have sufficient knowledge.

Instead, it offers dismissal or certainty -- stuff that may make religion or blog posts entertaining. But that&#x27;s not philosophy.<p>Besides, my vague insults are pretty much the common view (which is actually far more dismissive than I have been). It is anyone in the small minority who considers Yudkowsky a philosopher that requires substantive justification. In any case, even if you find his writings convincing, Yudkowsky would still make for a very bad foray into philosophy, because he tends to make up his own nomenclature rather than use accepted one (and present age-old ideas as his own). His fondness of definitive answers and ridicule of others means his work mostly serves to confuse rather than enlighten anyone who is interested in what philosophers do, or what current interesting debates are taking place.

It&#x27;s exactly the kind of result you&#x27;d expect when giving an impossible optimization without sufficient boundary constraint.

I invest a lot of time into gathering all the information available on the company and try hard to figure out what the main issues facing a company are before I even go there. That means that when I go and look at a company I <i>really</i> look at it. This has two possible outcomes: the first is that the company is actually flattered that someone would take them - and their investors - serious enough to spend the time to make sure everything works and works well. They&#x27;ll be proud to show someone that spent the time and effort to get to know their company and product how good they are at their jobs and how well their product is put together. If stuff surfaces that is not &#x27;ok&#x27; they either know about it and have a plan of mitigation but simply not enough time or other resources and if they didn&#x27;t know about it they&#x27;re grateful for the sincere feedback and will fix things as soon as possible.<p>The second possible outcome is that a lot of stuff surfaces that the people running the company may not even have been aware of and would rather not be aware of.<p>This all in contrast to the same job being done by larger companies which tend to output super nice and glossy reports that are essentially 50% gray paper, there isn&#x27;t anything you could do with a report like that except for pretending that you went through the motions of doing your job.<p>My reports by contrast are usually 20% the size of the competition without any graphs or other distracting elements but are full of actionable advice and clear guide as to whether or not I believe the investment is a good one or not and why. This doesn&#x27;t make me a whole lot of friends but the results are there and I stand by every word I write.<p>For the life of me I can&#x27;t imagine that VW with the budget they have and the amounts of money at stake would <i>not</i> give their compliance department the tools and the authority required to do their jobs. I&#x27;m still waiting for the other shoe to drop, someone leaking a mail archive from VW internal correspondence (assuming evidence has not been destroyed, which would make them look even worse) or something to that effect.<p>This goes <i>way</i> beyond a single arm of VW, it just isn&#x27;t possible and if it is then it is (counter-intuitively) actually worse for VW because it may mean they are not compliant with a whole bunch of other laws as well.<p>In that case essentially any VW vehicle would need to be re-certified for <i>all</i> aspects of a road worthiness certification because they have make it plain that their compliance departments are toothless paper tigers. And that might be a much worse path for VW than the one where they simply and openly admit to malice with respect to this one single aspect of their products.",1449842885

One could argue that if you removed guns from the equation while still retaining a population prone to violence the police would be in an even worse posture, because up close edged weapons are very dangerous and they don&#x27;t wear stab vests (which I suppose they could switch to, but I&#x27;m told they&#x27;re even more uncomfortable than soft ballistic body armor, which is bad enough).  Prone to violence in that as I recall our edged weapon murder rates exceeds most of &quot;the developed world&#x27;s&quot;.<p>Watch Tueller Drill video, then factor in the police <i>having</i> to close with someone with an edged weapon, an option I as a civilian can almost always avoid.  I say worse, because the public generally doesn&#x27;t realize the danger people armed with knives poise.<p>The experience of Brittian is suggestive, it:<p>Started getting serious about gun control a century ago (fear of the Left, becoming panic with the Bolshevik&#x27;s win).<p>Effectively outlawed the use of guns for self-defense in the &#x27;50s (courts) and &#x27;60 (statutory law).<p>Then went almost all the way to banning guns that might be useful for self-defense a few decades ago.<p>Hasn&#x27;t helped violence, hasn&#x27;t made much of a dent in &quot;gun violence&quot; as I recall, but could be wrong, and now the obsession is with knife control.<p>Which suggests a people problem, not an object problem.<p>(Then again, when the police are nationally centralized and used as a weapon to punish areas that vote &quot;incorrectly&quot; by mostly withdrawing their protection, you&#x27;ve got bigger problems, but again people problems.)",1449842733

Sounds bad but due to investments made an insurance company can still be profitable with a combined ratio of 100 or over.<p>This is what they&#x27;ll tell you, but most insurance companies make net revenue even before investment gains and assuming a combined ratio of 100, because they don&#x27;t include the sale of ancilliaries in the combined ratio. If they sell you car insurance, the basic premium is used to calculate the combined ratio, any alloy wheel cover, no claims protection, lost key cover, etc are kept out to make it seem like life as an insurance company is harder than it really is.",1449842675

Here on HN (and in the article linked today), there seems to be much uproar about &quot;blame the engineer&quot; because &quot;engineer&quot; is read as the underdog &quot;little guy in the trenches&quot;.

There it may apply to anyone in a department that is not strictly manufacturing, marketing or organizational like finance our HR, no matter how high up in the hierarchy and no matter how little actual engineering they still do - provided they actually have the academic grade. In german, you do not get to call yourself &quot;Ingenieur&quot; because you are doing engineering. Academic grades take very strong precedence over job descriptions (and terminologal collisions between those two areas are strictly avoided).<p>The only source for &quot;blame the engineer&quot; in the way it is read here on hacker news are some completely clueless excuses made by the CEO of Volkswagen USA, but that guy is hardly more than a glorified car dealer.",1449842664

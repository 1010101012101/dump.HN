That Intellectual Ventures (IV) is revealed to be a patent litigation engine is not surprising to folks who have followed the careers of folks like Nathan Mhyrvold. Back in 1998 the company I was with turned down money they offered because, regardless of their pitch, too much rested on their staying benign vs this. It didn't help that I had come off a really sour experience at Sun where I had tried to negotiate a right to implement the RSA patent in Java and at the last second RSADSI pulled a fast one and rewrote key parts of the contract which changed it into a license for their software (of no value to the Java effort).<p>Patents are chum in the business world, and they attract sharks.<p>That being said the cognitive dissonance of the loop here (Google -> MMI <- IV <- Google) suggests to me a complete breakdown of sanity.",1318031643
3086505,comment,3086284,3086284,1,0,jarjoura,,,"Wow, this is a really weird analogy to make. I don't agree that software can jump the shark by over-telling a story.  I think software is either focused and serves a well defined feature set, or it is chaotic and has several 1/2 defined features that are there only to check-off a bullet point in some marketing spec sheet.<p>For example:
People can argue that any one release of Adobe Photoshop has told its story, but yet Adobe continually adds new features to an application that's over 2 decades old.<p>Yes software does carry a lot of weight when it comes to visual design/art, but at the end of the day, it's a tool.  Each successive revision should continue to evaluate meeting the needs of its users and adopt changes to meet the demand.<p>Microsoft Office includes tons of new features, but they refined the UI to the point that it upset users who took time learning the new UI.  I think it was a step Microsoft needed to take and it worked out for them.<p>Apple's Final Cut Pro on the other hand, removed features to refine their app and upset their core audience. It was too complex for your pro-sumer, but too basic for the professional.  That's what I call losing focus.<p>So my point is, software will be successful if it has the resources and focus to make it happen.  It may take a long time to reach critical mass, but that's the beauty of a tool set, a nice long growth curve.<p>Entertainment on the other hand is a one-shot deal, either you like the performance and elements all work together, or you don't.",1318031617

We've certainly found that it's beguiling to want to add all the feature requests in, but sticking to our guns and making our core features work even better has proven a good method for us. One of our rules is: can it be hacked together? (the request). If there exists a way to do it at all, we don't focus on it, rather we invent what isn't possible to do at all (or is currently very expensive to do). It keeps us sane and interested in our work.",1318031601

Steve Jobs was famously blunt with his criticism in an environment that's excessively polite.<p>But RMS often violates social norms in a way that does little to advance his cause, the gp's story notwithstanding. Maybe this event was an appropriate time to violate the particular social norm of not criticizing your hosts. But it seems that, increasingly, most of RMS's violations close people's minds to the ideas he champions, instead of persuading them.<p>The point is to be persuasive. If it's effective to be shockingly blunt, great. Expressing relief at the death of Steve Jobs? Anecdotally, it does nothing to persuade me, and everything to <i>dis</i>suade me.",1318028897

Steve Jobs never put a gun to anyone's head and forced them to buy an Apple computer.<p>The fact that Stallman is known as an asshole is nothing to be proud of. Steve Jobs had a reputation for being tough, but he also had a reputation for bringing deals together and building products that brought joy to millions of people.<p>Arguably, Steve Jobs has put FOSS software in the hands of more desktop users than Stallman has. Every Apple computer comes loaded with lots of FOSS software. I'm sure that has every Stallman supporters' head spinning, but it's a fact.",1318028895

Both collection agents and patent trolls go about asking people to pony up the payment for goods (to put it colloquially) and they both do it on behalf of a third party, for whom doing it by themselves will involve a lot more of a hassles.<p>The distinction comes in the fact that in the case of collection agents, the payments owed to the goods are seemingly legitimate or at least socially accepted (perhaps collection agencies that come about collecting payments after those subscription-renewal or hidden-monthly-fee scams  might be construed as as much a nuisance as patent trolls). I guess socially, asking payments for ideas only seems reasonable if the persons going about asking for the payments  themselves come up with the idea.<p>It is a little weird and subtle.

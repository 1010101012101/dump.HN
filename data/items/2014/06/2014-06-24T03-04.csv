We realised that many people struggle hiring one (or more) ops people when they feel they&#x27;re not big enough, although already too big to actually keep going without.\nUsually, at that point, from our experience, we see two types of choices: 1- as you&#x27;re suggesting, hire an actual ops person (but switching from a platform like Heroku to something like AWS where everything should be configured manually, and constantly updated, may require more than one person in some cases...) 2- keep on using platforms like Heroku (and get ripped off).\nWe have been ourselves in this situation when we have launched the first version of our product, and are now happy users of our own solution ;)",1403582062

You can read all the stuff on the displays and in books, but you probably won&#x27;t.

My most recent peeves:<p>1) You can create range for loops over containers:<p><pre><code>  for (auto x: vec) {\n    foo(x);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nbut then if you want to do the same over a C array, you have to define your own wrapper with begin() and end() functions.<p>2. You can create shared pointers using make_shared, but you can&#x27;t create unique pointers using make_unique. What&#x27;s worse, if you define your own make_unique function, your code will eventually break because it&#x27;s already decided that C++14 will have its own make_unique.<p>I&#x27;m sure all of this will get fixed eventually, but frankly I don&#x27;t have more patience for this.

7936058,comment,7935872,7935872,6,0,araftery,,,"A new form accreditation is really what&#x27;s holding back a huge change in higher education. MOOCs right now, at most, can replace only traditional professional development classes. They&#x27;re still not a drop-in replacement for college degrees.<p>That&#x27;s because of accreditation. Bachelors degrees are valuable, in large part, because they&#x27;re a common currency: employers know when they see a potential hire has bachelor&#x27;s degree, he/she at least spent four years learning at a high level and fulfilled some level of competency in his/her chosen major.<p>Right now, there&#x27;s no way for employers to make similar judgments about people who have obtained their education entirely online, so it&#x27;s really hard to get a serious job in, say, software development, with just a few Coursera courses on your resumé. In that case, you&#x27;d need to build up a portfolio of OSS projects, etc. Whereas a newly-minted bachelor&#x27;s in CS will get your foot in the door somewhere, even without that extra work to back it up.<p>One approach to accreditation/evaluation are domain-specific exams, like the Boards in medicine or the Bar in law. But just passing an exam doesn&#x27;t necessarily communicate the same thing as a degree, and thus doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem. There are also, no doubt, disciplines not well suited to this form of accreditation. This approach (Alyxandria) seems more focused on accrediting courses (which solves the same problem) and does it by peer-reviewing those courses, which I think is a very interesting, credible, and scalable approach.<p>Right now, LinkedIn might be the closest competitor out there to this. They offer a form of peer-review for one&#x27;s skills with their endorsement feature. Another company that was trying to tackle this problem is Accredible[1], but it seems they&#x27;ve now pivoted to include many more features than peer accreditation — perhaps at its expense.<p>It&#x27;ll be really cool to see how this problem is solved in the long run. I think &quot;accrediting&quot; individuals, rather than institutions or classes that individuals can then take, will be the winning strategy, as education becomes increasingly unbundled. That is, if articles, YouTube videos, etc. are to be considered legitimate tools of learning in the future, as college classes are today, then accreditation of individuals  will be the only sensible approach.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.accredible.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accredible.com</a>",1403580563

If a student needs instruction, then the student can pay for the bits that they need.

It&#x27;s very likely that I&#x27;ll collaborate with the Freifunk Berlin and Project Meshnet communities.<p>What I do know, though, is which software/hardware combination I wanna explore: cjdns for routing on an end-to-end encrypted IPv6 network, Smallest Federated Wiki as an example of a federated web app, local file sharing as an example of local services, as well as something for Voice-over-IP.<p>Right now I&#x27;m preparing two small TP-Link TL-MR3020 routers (25 euros each) that won&#x27;t provide internet access directly, but instead serve a splash page with instructions and packages for the installation of cjdns on Linux and Android devices. The MR3020s run cjdns as well, and the devices will automatically peer on the Ethernet layer, without the need for traditional DHCP/IPv4. The routers have one USB port each, one will get a 3G stick for peering into cjdns&#x27; test network Hyperboria (via the Internet), and one will get a harddisk for file storage.<p>I also got my hands on a Medion Life NAS drive [2] which now runs OpenWRT and provides 2 TB of storage to any cjdns network that it gets plugged into.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate feedback regarding the application.

They admit right there that it&#x27;s possible they would discover a vulnerability and not disclose it.<p>But the part of the statement you left out is that Heartbleed in particular would only have met their criteria for disclosure due to the great danger to USG systems and systems used by private U.S. persons and entities.<p>> I suspect that this isn&#x27;t true, especially if the US government isn&#x27;t using OpenSSL for their internal security.<p>The USG uses OpenSSL everywhere.

It reads as if you know what you are talking about (at least the medical part)<p>(I cant think of a nice way to say &quot;conjecture&quot;, sorry about that.)<p>The link is there because physicists claim an optical microscope is limited to Rayleigh criterion.[0] Their uninformed conjecture holds that Rife&#x27;s microscope[1]  is not possible. After imagining the microscope not to exist it of course follows &quot;logically&quot; that Rife could not adjust the frequencies to those variations in shape and ph that you so elegantly pointed out.<p>But try telling that to the medical professionals looking though the microscope? A bit like going to the airport to tell people heavier than air flying machines are impossible. According to the physicists the further Rife zoomed in the less credible he gets.

Kendall, Director of Medical Research at Northwestern University and Dr. Milbank Johnson of Pasadena Hospital. Dr. Alvin G. Frood, President of the American Association of Pathologists joined Rife&#x27;s research. Moving microorganisms from prepared, diseased human tissue were photographed and filmed. On November 20,  forty-four doctors attended a dinner to celebrate &quot;The End To All Diseases&quot; at the Pasadena estate of Dr. Johnson[2]<p>in 1932, Kendall speaks before the Assoc. of American Physicians at Johns Hopkins University about the successes with Rife&#x27;s methods and treatments.<p>In 1933, Richard Edwin Shope discovered the first mammalian tumor virus.<p>Also in 1933, Rife completes the universal microscope. Upgrading his resolution claims from 17 000 X to a resolution of 31,000 times and a magnification of 60,000 times.<p>In 1934, The first clinic is opened. A special University of Southern California Medical Research Committee chaired by Milbank Johnson is formed to oversee the research. Committee members are: Whalen Morrison, Chief Surgeon of the Santa Fe Railway. George C. Dock, M.D. George C. Fischer, M.D., Children&#x27;s Hospital of New York, Arthur I. Kendall, Dr. Zite, M.D., professor of pathology of Chicago University. Rufus B. Von Klein Schmidt, President of USC. Also in attendance: Dr. James Couche of San Diego. Dr. Carl Meyer, Ph.D. of the Hooper Foundation, SF. Dr. Kopps of the Metabolic Clinic in La Jolla. The clinic is held at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla. Sixteen terminally ill people are treated. Fourteen are cured in three months, the other two are cured in six months.<p>In 1935, Dr. Milbank Johnson opens a second clinic with the same results.<p>In 1937, Dr. Milbank Johnson opens the third clinic with the same results. Drs. Couche of San Diego, Gruner of Montreal are also having great success.<p>In 1938, Fourteen machines are built. Two go to England, one goes to Dr. Richard Hamer of the Paradise Valley Sanitarium, one to Dr. Arthur Yale, two to Arizona doctors, and eight to Southern California doctors. Dr. Hammer cures an 82-year-old from Chicago of terminal cancer. Through this man, Morris Fishbein, head of the AMA in Chicago learns of Rife and his work. Fishbein visits Rife. Wants to buy in. Rife and his associates turn him down.<p>In 1938, The AMA indicts Rife for fraudulent medical practices. Rife wins the case, the AMA is made to pay $200,000.  During the trial and afterwards the AMA visits all doctors involved with Rife.

Not that you have to use every bit of it in your own code (in your own code you can get by with a very small subset), but the fact that because there&#x27;s little true consensus on which bits of it to use it, projects with external dependencies (that are also in C++) generally grow to use not only the entire language and standard library in different places, but also a bunch of badly hacked up reimplementations of the standard library that come along with some of those dependencies.",1403579351

Alcohol is estrogenic and inflammatory and dramatically depletes B vitamins and vitamin A. Sugar is simply a clean source of calories; perfectly harmless and often beneficial. Caffeine is quite simply good for you. All the epidemiological studies bear out the idea that it&#x27;s protective against stress and disease. It improves performance.

10829981,comment,10828450,10829697,0,0,srean,,,"Very nicely put and I agree. What I was expecting to see in the list of numpy problems mentioned in the article wasn&#x27;t there. The major problem that makes Numpy performance lag behind C++ or Fortran is the extra level of indirection that is needed for accessing an element (via stride ptr), and the need for extra copies that is forced on you by vectorization. Numexpr can help for certain cases of the latter, but its still quite limited in the type of expressions that numexpr can handle. It is my belief that with some local static analysis both can be mitigated somewhat.<p>It would be really interesting to see whether D&#x27;s nd object tackles these issues. The copy of arrays across function boundaries, as you correctly pointed out, is mostly a red herring.",1451811291

Uber takes value away from the middlemen, takes a smaller share of the middleman cut, and redistributes the remaining value to the driver and the passenger. Hence its popularity.<p>Most of the profit in the old system accrues to the taxicab company + medallion holder. Uber does hurt these folks, by giving more of the pie to the driver, who can now drive without owning a medallion & is not hurt by this barrier-to-entry, and Uber provides the rest as a discount to the passenger, who receives a better overall service at the same time (you see where the car is + estimated time, ratings, GPS, etc.)",1451811064

10829958,comment,10826836,10826836,0,0,dkural,,,"A counter-example, and a different framework to think about equality: Most of Scandinavia has fragmentation, freedom of expression, and genuine diversity of choice, diversity of lifestyle, of opinion, but it also has more equality. One can have a more equal society without raising taxes or massive wealth distribution. This is possible if a society ensures that its children receive adequate and equal access to healthcare and education in their earliest years, in other words, an equal start. This is where the US fails the most compared to Europe. Property taxes are the levers through the poor are priced out of good school districts. It acts as the algorithm through which self-segregation is made possible, often resulting in racial segregation as well. Education being a local affair ensures the wealthy and the educated have no incentive to fight for the rights of the poor and the ignorant, since they can get their fix via simply moving to a better neighborhood, leaving the others behind.  Not so in Europe. The leaders of the community put pressure on officials and the system, and as the one system improves, so does the lot of all.A similar dynamic is true in healthcare as well, in Europe:  A single-payer system ensures all get the same healthcare, and suddenly fixing it becomes a problem of upper-classes as well,  but the entire society benefits from the improved system.<p>PG&#x27;s post is self-justifying and self-interested.<p>Here&#x27;s an alternative explanation of fragmentation: It is the sign of a new industry. It&#x27;ll consolidate once it matures. Look at semiconductor & hardware consolidation. Google, Amazon, Apple, MSFT, Intel, Oracle etc. absorb a lot of software biz over time.

I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t closely examined stuff like <a href=""http://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/</a> (a minimalist Jupyter-esque interactive tutorial using a tiny JS Forth interpreter) but I have enough of a notion to understand that most FORTHs provide a more abstract[ly scoped] generic/conceptual/arbitrary environmental model, while colorForth and similar direct-on-chip environments are effectively machine access accelerators, and my interest lies almost exclusively with the latter - Forth as a programming style is the definitive predecessor of the DSL, so I see no benefit in using it for standardization. (I think this is where a lot of other people sit too, unless I&#x27;m misunderstanding the scene).<p>Further exploration and digging may prove this first impression incorrect, but I get the idea that these types of systems distill the essential moving parts of current computer architectures into a form readily parsed by the brain with minimal effort, and they do so at an arguably mathematically perfect level of irreducible complexity.<p>My question now is, taking into account the ultra-long-term trends hiding under the surface of the theory of everything/mental model/dev setup/framework/language of the month and identifying the elixirs they&#x27;re trying to reach for, would it be possible to produce a modern reimagination of these types of environments oriented toward the current architectural and social level of, er, <i>progress</i>? For example, &quot;everything in Ring 0!!&quot; (or the functional equivalent of it) worked great for the Symbolics Lisp Machine as a hacker&#x27;s box, but everyone&#x27;s obsessed with putting jails inside containers inside virtual machines now, so such an approach would no longer be found acceptable.<p>Now it&#x27;s my turn to not be able to link something - I remember reading recently about someone who described their experience of using a Forth system on their microcomputer, where they could ask the environment they were using to display the internal code routines it would run when functions were called, etc, and it made tinkering with hardware, I/O, etc incredibly easy, since <i>everything</i> was <i>right there</i>, and you could get instant, direct and authoritative answers to questions like &quot;what does this system call do?&quot; and &quot;how do <...> and <...> interact?&quot;.

And what is hard often isn&#x27;t obvious to someone who isn&#x27;t an engineer.<p>They did shit -- and the memories are coming back! -- like build multiple versions of the hardware that fixed different problems.  Guess what they didn&#x27;t do?  Create any fucking way to query from the computer side what version of hardware you were talking to.  Until rev 8 or 9.  I spent probably a cumulative month figuring out (usually) non-destructive ways to guess from different faults which version of hardware a computer was talking to.  And there was fun stuff like the servo motor with no hardware stop (used to move a lens closer/further from a laser) and different gearing ratios on different revs that could do $10-$20k of damage to lenses if you didn&#x27;t know exactly what you were talking to.  Because all you told the motor was degrees to rotate the shaft, but the aforementioned different gearing meant you could ram a lens into a laser because later revs traveled 3x as far per rotation.<p>One thing that solved lots and lots of problems for us was I finally harangued the ceo into just shipping our own computers with the machines.

Often with a not particularly computer literate bio grad student on the other end.  Just shipping our own computer with daq and software pre-installed and refusing to support anything but our own computers ($600 dells) got rid of a class of problems and replaced them with just one: the NIDaq card was jarred out of its slot during shipping.

I didn&#x27;t get drunk for the first time until near the end of my senior year in high school. It was great fun, and it helped me feel accepted. I drank a bit more, especially as graduation got closer.<p>One night I blacked out, and scared myself at how much I drank. I asked my best friend that week to &quot;Stop me if I ever start to drink like that again.&quot; He looked me in the eye and told me he couldn&#x27;t do that, because his dad was an alcoholic and he&#x27;d grown up hearing comments like that all his life. I had no idea.<p>I decided to hold off on drinking for a while, knowing that I have a tendency to dive into new things. I ended up not drinking at all through college. I went to plenty of parties, and it wasn&#x27;t awkward at all because everyone knew me as someone who just didn&#x27;t drink. It was a relief to try a beer some time after graduation and realize I could enjoy a drink or two with friends and not get drunk.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of lives seriously impacted by alcohol, and I&#x27;m grateful every day that I found a way to manage my consumption at a young age.

10829915,comment,10828513,10828513,0,0,sytelus,,,"Pg&#x27;s main point is that the major source of wealth inequality comes from wealth creators as opposed to wealth exploiters. The wealth creators are typical startups and people creating new industries while wealth exploiters are the one playing high frequency trading, lobbing congress, buying up real estate, creating monopolies, investing with insider info and so on. My gut feeling is that wealth creation part is in reality less than 20%. This intuition is based on simple fact that wealthy people have managed to far more disproportionately increase their wealth than what comes from increase in GDP or other measures of productivity. There is plenty of analysis available in Capital book that clearly suggests that wealthy people mainly invests in non-productive investment instruments such as real estate that has nothing to do with increasing productivity of the society. It just constraints the supply side, inflating prices and thus increasing value of the investment. These investment tools enables them to transform themselves to become passive wealth exploiters with a setup that generates massive multi-generational income and wealth increase without proportional need for positive contribution to society. There was a very well written article with data analysis on HN that proved that most increase in wealth for top 1% came from these non-productive investment tools such as real estate. This is like wealthy people grouping up to buy loads of the fresh water and inflating prices so average people now must pay majority of income in buying water. So wealth transfer from common people to rich occurs through inflated water prices. Of course, if wealthy people really did this for water, they will be in trouble and revolutions will break out. However doing this for real state raises no eye brows even though real estate is essential need for humans.<p>A fun fact: Despite of giving billions and without starting any new blockbuster companies, Bill Gates has managed to increase his wealth by more than 50% since he officially retired. He has sure helped few startups but it would be too funny as well as cruel to think that most of his wealth gain comes via helping startups or causing productivity gains in society. Last I checked his billions are managed by hedge fund like setup who typically have goal to maximize returns through non-productive instruments such as real estate, HFT, commodity market games, derivatives etc and they rarely devote more than 20% of portfolio to truely productive activities such as startups.<p>It is also marvelous how some of the wealthiest have outright bought the laws for themselves, for example, middle class in US universally pays almost twice the tax rates than top 1%. This would be unthinkable in previous generation. The entire capital tax gimmic is put in to law with a full knowledge that it does not benefit majority of citizens who have little or no savings, let alone investments for short term trading. It is purely designed to benefit top 1% who derives large chunk of income as capital gains. The most depressing thing is that the field is becoming less and less level playing, for example wealthy can buy out admissions in best universities while average citizens are getting priced out from same institutions. The significant increase in mortgage and student debt load combined with long term stagnant wages now eliminates possibility of savings or investments and therefore risk taking. I suppose this wasn&#x27;t exactly like this in 70s when many more people had decent savings, had ability for some risk taking and lot of them even actually were able to retire. In our generation most people don&#x27;t even think of retirement anymore except in tech industry which is probably less than 5% of population. We in tech field are perhaps not so much impacted and so world looks little different from our glasses, especially if you had been college dropout or without family. However for a common citizen with a family, mortgage, healthcare bills, no savings, retirement funds uncertainty and student loans it is much more difficult to cross the chasm than it used to be in 70s.",1451809022

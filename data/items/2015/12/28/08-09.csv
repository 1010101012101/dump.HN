Neither strategy is really the right one, it depends on the context of what you&#x27;re trying to do. If only all young programmers could be taught a history of programming class where they analyze old deprecated technologies that used to be popular, and form an understanding why they rose to prominence and why they faded away. Maybe we could avoid new generations making the same mistakes over and over again with different technologies.",1451293193

React can be rendered on the server and sent in the initial request using ReactDOM.renderToString.<p>> You hate maintaining an entire application in Javascript...<p>No I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;d rather write an entire application in JS than write an application (backend and frontend) in two different languages, or write a frontend as a series of ad-hock JS scripts. If I hated maintaining an entire app in JS, why would I maintain it using JS? I use JS for everything because I prefer it to the alternatives.<p>> a simple CRUD application for which client side rendering is unnecessary.<p>No one needs to do an SPA. The world got by just fine without it. For me, the reasons to do an SPA with ES2015 modules had to do with simplifying my frontend architecture. JQuery is easier to get wrong compared to the render-everything mindset of React.<p>> Google doesn&#x27;t use AngularJS for Gmail.<p>Good for them. Angular sucks IMHO. That being said, Gmail came long before Angular, and why migrate when you have a working product?<p>> Facebook doesn&#x27;t use ReactJS for Facebook.<p>Facebook doesn&#x27;t use ReactJS for --everything-- on Facebook. The fact that React can be gradually migrated into an existing application is one of React&#x27;s greatest strengths.<p>Facebook do, however, use React for Instagram. They even use webpack for this.<p>> Twitter doesn&#x27;t use client side rendering.<p>Define client side rendering. When I scroll down on the page and new items magically appear, I would say that is client side rendered. The time to first see the content, using React, could be done by first rendering React on the backend. But why migrate when you got a working product?<p>> People are building a mountain of abstractions and investing so much time to over-engineer everything in Javascript. WHY?!<p>Is it over-engineering when it solves a problem and does nothing more than it has to? React renders views, that&#x27;s it. You can render on the frontend, backend or both. React is easier to use than having many different JQuery-based scripts.<p>In short. React does one thing. It does it well, and it simplifies my UI code. How is this over-engineering? I could say the same for gulp (for me, easier than bash scripts), webpack (easier than makefiles), ( node+express (waaaaay easier than Java or C#), Immutable.js (makes things easier to reason about) and the rest of my pure JS-stack.",1451291924

E.g. even in a very dark sky where you can see stars you never remember seeing, Orion&#x27;s belt is very easy to recognize, because three collinear stars so close together are a fairly rare sight. Same for the North Star -- it&#x27;s not too bright, but it&#x27;s related to two very recognizable constellations and you can find the North based on other clues as well, so you know where to look. Once you&#x27;ve identified one constellation, it&#x27;s pretty easy to find the other ones.<p>- It also helps if you&#x27;re familiar with how the sky looks in various seasons. This way, you have a pretty good idea about what should be where. Granted, this probably doesn&#x27;t work well if you have to travel a lot. My home country is pretty small; in its northernmost point, the sky looks pretty much the same as in its southernmost.

If you have a page template, which declares dependencies on various partials, each of which declares dependencies on images and JS modules and CSS partials, then Webpack can grok all those dependencies and do things like bundling the images/JS/CSS needed for this or that subset of pages (along with hot loading, source maps, etc.).<p>Of course, it can also do stuff like minification and transpilation while it does this, so it tends to get compared to grunt/etc. But the magic of webpack isn&#x27;t the bundling, it&#x27;s that you can build highly modular pieces of web content and leave webpack to work out what needs bundling.",1451291899

Companies differ tremendously.<p>In particular, I personally was spoiled working for a company where the founders are very good negotiators, apparently even better ones than the various i-bankers they dealt with. For instance, they never took any VC money, presumably under the assumption that VCs might decide to gut the company if it doesn&#x27;t become profitable in a time frame which for them seemed too short. They also made sure to raise tons of money years and years before running out of already-raised money; the conventional wisdom is you&#x27;re not a bank and you should only raise capital when you absolutely need it, you shouldn&#x27;t have stashes of idle cash, but the problem with this approach is that you raise money when you&#x27;re desperate and this diminishes your bargaining power tremendously. Raising money long before it&#x27;s really needed resulted in really good deals for them.<p>I was also spoiled working for a company with a simple business model and pretty predictable revenues so it wasn&#x27;t that hard to put a conservative lower bound on its future value.<p>Anyway, I only addressed the really wrong arguments that I heard a lot, that after a late-stage investor gets on board the stock &quot;can&#x27;t possibly rise any more&quot; (meaning, the late-stage investor is at best going to not lose money but can&#x27;t possibly make any, so they&#x27;re much dumber than you are); and, &quot;even if it rises, it&#x27;ll just rise a little&quot; (which neglects the arithmetic of how your capital gain is calculated.)

Then John Resig&#x27;s (JQuery) book &quot;Pro JavaScript Techniques&quot; (2006).<p>Later Douglas Crockford&#x27;s book &quot;JavaScript the Good Parts&quot; (2008) were highly influential. HTML5 and JavaScript5 came along. A new wave of JS5 vanilla style influenced by JS5 and Crockford&#x27;s book got traction and more and more replaced JQuery (2010 onwards). HTML5 browsers got widespread, the JS performance got a lot faster (JIT VMs) and attracted a lot more developers.<p>CoffeeScript and new single-page frameworks like AngularJS and Ember.js got popular ca. 2012.<p>Google initially focused on Dart language as a replacement for Javascript and later transpiled to JS (beside others). Microsoft aquirehired ex-IBM group now known as Monaco code editor (VS Online, VSCode, etc) and created TypeScript that suits their C++/C# massive code base and coding pattern better. They influenced the development of ES6/7 to include &quot;classes&quot; syntax, etc.<p>Google added &quot;Shadow DOM&quot; feature to Chrome and proposed it as a new HTML5 feature. <a href=""http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowd...</a><p>Shadow DOM hasn&#x27;t been integrated in other browser (<a href=""http://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdom</a> ) though Facebook thought the idea was good (&quot;Virtual DOM&quot;) and re-implemented the idea as JavaScript library; what is now known as ReactJS framework (got popular in 2014).<p>On the otherside NodeJS with NPM and its ecosystem of many tiny libraries got popular in 2011.<p>ES6/7 got popular on server and client side (though later still needs a transpiler step).<p>So we are again with huge JS framworks on the client side (1MB minified JS files are common but not funny on mobile devices). And highly modular small libraries on the server side (NodeJS).<p>Probably in time when full ES6/7 and Shadow DOM support gets traction in all modern browser, we will see another wave of more lean vanilla ES6/7 code without the huge libraries. You can write a super responsive and fast JS web app in less than 300KB code. You ask for trouble with your 1+MB JS file, especially on mobile devices that will crash or the users has to wait 30+sec on a cellular connection.<p>Lean vanilla JavaScript is great and high performant. Over-engineered frameworks make your life easier to start but will make it harder to stay in touch and maintain. Hopefully ShadowDOM browser support gets traction.",1451290900

At this startup, they wouldn&#x27;t let you resell these ads for mobile searches because it would hurt margins (seems like shaky reasoning to me, who doesn&#x27;t like more money / more profit?).<p>Then a smattering of recent news stories with tangential relationships to your main thesis about margins (YouTube (when have the margins been broken out on this?), Android (not sure how this fits into your narrative about the decline of Google&#x27;s growth)) mixed in with some real medium term competitive threats (EU, Facebook/Bing (didn&#x27;t FB used to redirect their search traffic to Bing? not sure that made much of a difference)).<p>Here&#x27;s some alternative narratives:<p>a) There&#x27;s far more to profitability on online advertising than average CPC, like query mix as I mentioned before. Additionally, advertising on Google owned & operated properties have been continually far more profitable and growing at a much faster pace than relabeled search advertising or AdSense on third party websites. Google has refocused their engineering / sales efforts on advertising products on their owned & operated properties and de-emphasized properties like Blekko.<p>b) Google&#x27;s PE ratio has gone from <20x in 2010 to >30x today. The market believes Google&#x27;s growth prospects are brighter than ever.<p>To summarize, I also keep a careful eye on Google / other tech company&#x27;s financials and how they relate to both my personal work and larger trends in the industry as a whole. I simply disagree with your theses that a) search engine margins are decreasing and b) that the search engine business needs to grow at a faster rate for Google to continue to grow sustainably due to a) the continued power of direct response search advertising and b) other growth areas like video, brand, mobile, and new markets.",1451290129

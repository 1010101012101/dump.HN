That said, here's what I'd say:<p>The core of the issue is with cache-friendly access patterns. This is a simplified explanation, but here goes: CPUs only have so much cache, and the processor needs to keep enough data in that cache that it won't be left waiting for too long before the next batch of data requested from ram is available. To that end, when you access a chunk of memory, the CPU will grab the requested region and then some, hoping that most of your work for the next few microseconds will be within that region. The second implementation jumps by 1024 x sizeof(double) at each access (so, on my system that's 8k), which is plenty far to blow through whatever memory was prefetched with your access, and in so doing force the processor to sit around and wait for another memory location to be cached.<p>There's another, probably less significant way in which this is a pathological access pattern: alignment. When, in the first implementation, the processor operates on contiguous blocks of memory it is free to prefetch memory in nicely sized chunks that begin and end on convenient numbers, which is important because memory today is nothing if not a tower of multiplexed access -- asking for a few extra bits over the edge of a row, wherever those borders happen to be for your system (probably the width of the memory bus is a good guess), may not seem like much, but if it means the memory controller has to access a row of ram that it otherwise wouldn't, that involves first writing the data in the starting row, then waiting for the appropriate delay to save that data before switching rows and repeating the process. Looking at zeroarray2 in that context, you're asking the memory controller to save sizeof(double)*8 bits of zeroes, a fraction of a row, at once before moving on to another row only to revisit the first some time later.<p>Answers to the questions pertaining to memory (rather than concurrency) can all be found in Ulrich Drepper's excellent tour of contemporary memory systems, ""What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory"" ( <a href=""http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf</a> ).<p>edit: fixed accidental italics, added useful additional reading link.",1349785116

It can still use up most of a core when maxed out...<p>...however, I did some math and some extrapolation and determined that within the next three to five years this domain will be completely reasonable to approach from JS, driven by a combination of technologies:<p>-access to GPGPU from the browser. DSP work can generally be defined in terms of a shader, although it's still a very poorly understood area.<p>-more general-purpose cores, faster JIT performance, and possibly single-threaded hardware improvements as well. These things compound easily, so we could end up with a 50-100x larger JS performance envelope for this domain without even considering the GPU.<p>-maturation of the existing and planned audio APIs for common tasks. As you point out, this isn't interesting from a ""ground-breaking tech"" perspective, but in covering typical application needs, it's as important as the others since it's both convenient and optimized out of the box.<p>-maturation of cross-compilation technologies, smoothing over the ""code has already been written"" issue.<p>In a lot of ways, all JS has to do to be competitive is the ""catch-up"" work.

But what I think most people miss is that to ""be in space"" the way most people think about space you'll need to enter orbit which means that once you get up to 160+ km altitude you need to go sideways at roughly 24 times the speed of sound - and then you're in orbit. Then when you're all done having your fun you need to take all that orbital energy and do something with it. The best idea so far is to use it to burn up a heat shield.

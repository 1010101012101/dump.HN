Since then I always put in the stock work week, broken down how ever it is supposed to be broken down.  <i>Regardless of what I actually work</i>.  I keep my real hours in a personal spread sheet so I know how much time I'm over or under and actually work from that.<p>As a side note, this extra time you're working is just time thrown in the trash.  No one is going to thank you for it and if everyone else is doing the same thing you wont even get any kind of promotion for it since it's not ""above and beyond"".

2257291,comment,2257047,2257047,0,0,jamn,,,"It is sad to see some areas where people on average are doing significantly worse than the richest parts of the United States.<p>However, I find the choice of the term 'Third World America' to be particularly deceiving. Let's take Louisiana, for example, marked as amongst the worst regions according to the infographic. Median earnings are 28,000 and about 75% with at least high school education.<p>Now let's compare against Mexico's average. Mexico is not nearly as bad as other third world countries. Average earnings are about 7,000 USD/year [1] (and median earning is probably worse). Roughly have of Mexicans haven't completed their junior high school education (6th to 9th). These are national averages, though, which --unlike the infographic -- do not focus only on the poorest areas. The poorest areas are, of course, much worse.<p>I'm not trying to say with this that you shouldn't complain if others have it worse. I am just saying that this particular choice of wording is not realistic and, in my mind, took away from the credibility of the rest of the site .<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/12/07/index.php?section=economia&article=028o1eco"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/12/07/index.php?section=econ...</a> \n[2] <a href=""http://simposio.asu.edu/2004/docs/mesas/2/suarez.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simposio.asu.edu/2004/docs/mesas/2/suarez.pdf</a>",1298533765

Someone will train you, meaning show you the reproducible steps for operating the machinery or replacing worn brakes.

2257264,comment,2255698,2256295,0,0,tzs,,,"We tried to use something other than zlib once. The application needed to make a copy of a CD-ROM and compress the copy. This was back in the day when a couple gigs was a big hard drive, and 200 MHz was a fast CPU. We first tried zlib but it wasn't fast enough for the client. We looked around, and found another library, written by a graduate student, that was a lot faster. It didn't compress as well, but it was good enough for the client, given the speed. The only problem was it was under GPL, and no way was the client going to open source the application.<p>We contacted the grad student, and worked out a tentative deal to license the library for around $2k and started working out the details. Then he got all paranoid about Microsoft. Most of our products were Windows products--so what if Microsoft bought us? Would they end up with a Microsoft-wide site license for his library? He wanted to put into the contract terms that would terminate the license if our company changed ownership. Those kind of terms are tricky. Would we lose the license if we went public? What if one of the two major owners (who together owned about 99% of the stock) died and the stock went to their kids?<p>The CEO (who was one of those two owners) didn't have time to deal with that, said screw it, and told me to find something else.<p>So I went back to zlib, and put a slider in the ripper settings to control speed vs. compression. The implementation was to simply skip compressing some of the blocks when ripping. The slider controlled what percentage of blocks were compressed.<p>PS: ~12 years later, we're still owned by the same owner. Microsoft has not ever tried to buy us.",1298532693

You write on the paper, and draw, with a special pen, and it records sound along with the time code. If you're familiar with Serato Scratch Live it's a similar concept to that - basically taking a ""real world"" interface and semi-digitising it using some form of time encoding.<p>Speech to text is HARD and what's worse is inaccuracies in a medical field could result in some really serious consequences (misdiagnosis, improper dosage, incorrect medication being prescribed etc.)<p>Doctors are pretty used to shorthand, and also my understanding is they quite often have a typist for dictations - perhaps an alternative to speech to text is to record speech by proximity in time to what has been typed. That way they could be saying something, take <i>minimal</i> notes but have a sound file linked to those notes. That way they can elaborate on the notes later if required, but also if they go back to their notes and can't remember what the hell they meant when they wrote ""PKR instead"", they can touch ""PKR instead"" to hear what they were saying at that time in the conversation, and fastfoward, rewind to get the context.",1298531725

Companies that know what they are doing know that that has to be paid for somehow, and it is coming out of their margins, which sucks.",1298530836

577404,comment,577101,577101,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"Punishment is an awful way to motivate anyone, yourself included. The reason we think it works is because that's how everybody else in our lives treat us: parents, the school system, employers, financial institutions, etc. We get to the point where we think we have to be abused in order to perform, like whipping a dancing bear.<p>Trying to motivate with punishment leads to value judgment, leads to guilt, leads to mental avoidance.<p>Avoidance involves much less effort than actually doing the work.<p>Which is the real reason that it's hard to get personal projects done.<p>One other reason is that people talk themselves into doing personal projects because they ""should,"" not because they're fired up. And lastly, burn-out from the should-punishment-guilt-avoidance cycle makes it hard to get motivated.<p>When you get out of this cycle, when you cut yourself a break, when you stop ""shoulding all over yourself,"" magical things can happen... and you can devote regular time to things because you love them, without breaking out the stick <i>or</i> the carrot.",1240577903

In fact I wrote a little piece awhile ago about how one can overcome distractions and in it I describe there are essentially two motivating factors: one is pleasure and the other is pain.<p><a href=""http://www.davecheong.com/2006/09/13/how-to-overcome-distractions-anytime/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davecheong.com/2006/09/13/how-to-overcome-distrac...</a><p>The same analogy can be used here. In order to accomplish something important to you (say your startup), you can either increase the pleasure or satisfaction you get when you achieve it, and/or increase the pain associated with failure.<p>So I take your point about focusing on the negative, but I never claim that ""the only motivation that works is negative"". In fact I believe both positive/negative and pleasure/pain play important roles as motivators.<p>Having said all that, don't underestimate the power of the fear of failure/pain/punishment, as it is a major component of the human condition. I disagree that only ""mediocre"" things can be created out of fear and punishment for failure.<p>In fact, experienced entrepreneurs will tell you that a ""big unstoppable desire to build things"" is a terrible thing to build a sustainable business on. Sure, it's great to kick start things, but building a business is 99% hard work. Can you truly build a business on sheer desire alone? What if that desire went away? Ask yourself that question the next time you are up at 3am trying to fix an obscure bug in someone else's code.<p>Thanks for the great comment!

Arguments with facts would really be <i></i>constructive<i></i>.<p>I am sincerely interested if my current assumptions are true or where I am wrong.<p>Background:<p>My current employer asked me about MySQL and I mentioned those points below which were later countered with this:<p>http://pastie.org/456941<p>(Large) Parts of this gave me the classical ""WTF"" moment.

A X/Open XA distributed transaction processing (DTP) support; two phase commit as part of this, using Oracle's InnoDB engine<p>Full-text indexing and searching using MyISAM engine<p>Should Oracle at some point decide to revoke the usage rights of InnoDB for the open source community then users of MySQL would need to\nswitch to MyISAM which is, frankly said, terribly slow.<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL#Criticism\nRegarding the licensing renewal which is necessary. Now even Oracle is planning to buy Sun, which would make me think hard why they would renew the license of InnoDB for MySQL anyway? (creating competition - ""multi-year"" extension of their licensing agreement, why would they continue?)<p>The next reason was that I have no theoretical, but empirical proof (I didn't enjoy debugging that) that I end up more often with table data corruption if I run MySQL. Ok, I can repair it, but why should that take up more of my time away doing other more productive things?\n(It is even mentioned in the Criticism point of the wikipedia link above).<p>Also critical bugs get fixed slowly.

That's leaving states with sales taxes with revenue shortfalls that have to be made up somehow.<p>California could get rid of its sales tax in favor of a hike in the income tax, but such large changes in tax policy are hard to pull off.  In the meantime, California and other states are losing revenue more and more revenue to these types of sales - and there really is little they can do about it.  Let's face it, this proposal sounds like a huge stretch to claim jurisdiction - a stretch that I'd think a federal court would laugh out of its chambers.<p>But whether this is a good solution or not, we're left at the same place: states are desperately hurting for revenue right now and it's becoming ever easier to avoid sales taxes.  In the end, one of two things is likely to happen: states will get rid of their sales taxes seeing them as unenforceable in exchange for other tax hikes, or the federal government will step it to give states such jurisdiction ala <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9919420-7.html?tag=mncol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9919420-7.html?tag=mncol</a>",1240576021

In particular, he seemed to avoid the advice that Seneca was giving.  Seneca was not advocating idleness or balance.  No, indeed he was recommending isolation, asceticism, detachment from frivolity and dissociation with business affairs so that one may focus on the pursuit of virtue through self-control by rational thought. More directly, he suggests that the best life is to study the ancient works. In his own words:<p>Of all men they alone are at leisure who take time for philosophy, they alone really live; for they are not content to be good guardians of their own lifetime only. They annex ever age to their own; all the years that have gone ore them are an addition to their store. Unless we are most ungrateful, all those men, glorious fashioners of holy thoughts, were born for us; for us they have prepared a way of life. By other men’s labours we are led to the sight of things most beautiful that have been wrested from darkness and brought into light; from no age are we shut out, we have access to all ages, and if it is our wish, by greatness of mind, to pass beyond the narrow limits of human weakness, there is a great stretch of time through which we may roam. We may argue with Socrates, we may doubt with Carneades, find peace with Epicurus, overcome human nature with the Stoics, exceed it with the Cynics. Since Nature allows us to enter into fellowship with every age, why should we not turn from this paltry and fleeting span of time and surrender ourselves with all our soul to the past, which is boundless, which is eternal, which we share with our betters?<p>For more information on Stoicism (in the classical, not popular, sense) : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism</a>",1240575630

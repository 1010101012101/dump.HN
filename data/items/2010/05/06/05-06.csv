It is elementary that successful compilation does not imply correct code; but that is not what Ayende is talking about at all.<p>There are specific, disciplined ways in which you can use the compiler to reliably tell you what you need to fix when making certain kinds of changes.  Such techniques are very valuable in large codebases.  For example, you change the semantics of an interface method slightly, and this results in changing the type of the return value, or the arguments.  After changing the method signature in the interface, the compiler tells you exactly where you need to make corresponding changes in the rest of your large codebase.  Naturally, it can't tell you exactly what changes to make - for that you use your brain.  But it tells you exactly where you need to make changes, and gives a good general idea of what changes to make.<p>That's the kind of technique this post is talking about. Whether you intend it or not, dismissing effective use of such powerful tools as ""confusing compilation with correctness"" is both misleading, and kind of insulting to users of strongly typed languages who know what they're doing.",1273124450

1323652,comment,1323064,1323371,0,0,barrkel,,,"The type system <i>is</i> a unit test of expected inputs and outputs - it ensures that values are bounded to their domains, and aren't manipulated incorrectly.<p>The advantage of doing it like Ayende says is when you already have a mental model of the transformation that you want to perform, the compiler can do the work of showing you the bits you need to edit to finalize the transformation. This process isn't mindless; because you've informed the type system about the substructure of your code, when you want to change the shape of that substructure, the compiler is then able to tell you exactly where it is now inconsistent.<p>Whereas with dynamically typed code, you need unit tests with 100% path coverage (line coverage isn't enough) to guarantee that you caught every interaction, if you were to approach the change in the same way. (As an aside: that's a whole lot of tests that need rewriting and refactoring, one reason I don't like unit testing for very early stages of a project when the design is quite fluid.) The alternative is eyeballing the code and perhaps getting a runtime type violation or two before all the locations are gotten right.<p>Note that here I'm <i>only</i> talking about finding the locations to modify, <i>not</i> about guaranteeing that the modifications are correct. If the structural change is simple, where all the in-place modifications are trivial, having a static type system that tells you about all the locations is really handy, whereas you need to do a lot more work with a dynamic type system.<p>IMO the benefits of a dynamic type system are more apparent when the systems you're working with are themselves dynamic and (relatively) quickly changing in nature, or when the substructure is too tedious to efficiently express in a static type system (especially apparent with mutually recursive generic types with dependencies among type parameters, like you might find in generic parsing and graph transformation libraries, etc.).",1273123640

Basically: think with your heart. It sounds like the decision's been made. And damn the folks who think job hoppers suck. This future employer obviously thinks you're good to go. So will the next, if they approach you or are willing to talk. The whole ""job hoppers are worthless"" movement is only but a fraction of the potential employers. Those who believe it won't talk to you. There are plenty who think that mentality is rubbish. Do what you feel is right.",1273122037

StackOverflow has saved my life on many occasions.<p>I hope they spend significant time on evolving the Stack Exchange UI away from the parent sites. I can't help feeling 'oh here's another one' every time i come across a SE powered site.",1273122012

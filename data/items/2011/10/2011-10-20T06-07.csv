Seriously, it's like a phase people go through.<p>Regardless of whether you feel better about yourself or not, intentionally self-sacrificing for the benefit of others is altruism (time, effort, or money are the usual)  - there's nothing in the definition saying you must endure some sort of pain or end up less of a person as a result.",1319093103

I have no doubt vendor supported Linux (Redhat, Ubuntu, etc...) will be able to work around this.  But what will the steps be for a custom kernel? It seems to be something like this:<p><pre><code>    1) Build kernel
    2) Generate key
    3) Sign kernel with key
    4) Install key in UEFI key manager
</code></pre>
But the question I have is, what do we do with the key now? Is it kept on disk? If so, does that open up a new vector for attack? A Linux virus/worm that finds the signing key, generates a new hacked kernel, signs it, and then installs itself?<p>I know that's a lot of steps, but then again, if a malevolent program gains root on a box, you can't really trust anything on it anymore.  So I guess there isn't really anything too different about this approach, except that it may give you a false sense of security.<p>I'd hope that there could be some warning about booting a <i>new</i> kernel.

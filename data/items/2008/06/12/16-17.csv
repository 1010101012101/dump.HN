I think putting a price on my time was one of the most difficult and subjective things I’ve had to do. My biggest consideration was how much I needed to make to cover my overhead & make a profit.

216078,comment,215978,215993,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I advocate for the dissolution of the Federal Reserve. The world had very stable interest rates and inflation rates before the institution of fiat monopoly money (monopoly as in the sense of only one legal producer, but the other connotation works as well). If you knew that the interest rate on 10-yr AAA bonds was going to be within +/- 0.5% a year from now, don't you think that would make it easier to do business? Instead, we have a system where next year is +/- ~4.0%.<p>People point out other drawbacks of the free banking and classical gold standard eras, and I agree that the systems had their problems. However, they were also working with a much smaller and less technological economy. In addition, they were hampered with idiotic anti-banking laws (such as unitary branching), most of which have been repealed today.<p>I don't think we need a price-setter on the short term credit markets, and I don't think we need legal monopoly money. I don't think the arguments for the market break down in the monetary sphere.<p>Anti-Fed people might not always state their case well, but that doesn't mean there is not a good case. There are a few Nobel's among the gold bugs.",1213289651

216071,comment,215664,215664,0,0,euccastro,,,"I tried it for a few weeks. I got mildly test infected, but I don't do it anymore.<p>I found unit tests are most adequate for the parts of my code I'm the most confident about anyway (i.e., the functional parts). Testing side-effects intensive code (e.g., games) can be done and the discipline can improve your design skills and taste. But it can also drag you into boilerplate addiction and architecture astronautics.<p>But what really keeps me from writing unit tests is that they are a hindrance for the types of changes that scare me the most: those that introduce far-reaching changes to the interfaces between parts of my codebase. Those kinds of changes force you to rewrite your tests anyway. Thus, they add a cost and a mental barrier without offering the desired confidence in the transition (in a way, tests and code 'validate' each other; part of that confidence is lost while you are refactoring your tests).<p>To summarize: they help where I least need it, and they are a net hindrance where I'd need their help the most.<p>I don't do pacemakers or financial software, so I'd rather get the occasional bug during development, and use heavy human testing before release.<p>I said something on these lines a while ago here:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46284"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46284</a>",1213289034

216035,comment,215664,215664,0,0,riso,,,"One thing that that I don't like about unit testing is it can give you false positives that everything is working correctly.<p>When you follow the red-green pattern and write the test, have it fail, then write the code to make it pass, I find that my brain is thinking the same when I write the test to when I write the code.  So as a simple example if I write a test that says add(2,2).should == 5, it fails since there is no add() method.  I then quickly write the add method to allow the test to pass and I am happy that I get a passing test even though the logic is incorrect.  Obviously this is an over-simplification, but I have experienced situations that have some resemblance.<p>I can't say I always agree with the laziness argument. I can't even count the number of times it would take me only a few lines of code to get something done, but writing all the unit tests increases the amount of time to complete the task by a factor of 10.  Other times the tests are easily saving me hours in a day. So it depends on exactly what they are testing and how they are doing so.<p>I am not saying I don't like them all the time, just sometimes :)",1213287099

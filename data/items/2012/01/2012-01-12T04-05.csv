When people claim that ""SOPA breaks DNSSEC"" (note they don't say the reverse) they mean that a SOPA blockage looks the same as a MITM attack from the client's perspective. As I've explained earlier, ISPs can choose to make it look like a DNS server outage instead of an MITM; this might produce fewer misleading errors in the browser. SOPA works fine as written, it just makes DNS debugging harder. ""Users running secure applications have a need to distinguish between policy-based failures and failures caused, for example, by the presence of an attack or a hostile network, or else downgrade attacks would likely be prolific."" <a href=""http://www.circleid.com/pdf/PROTECT-IP-Technical-Whitepaper-Final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.circleid.com/pdf/PROTECT-IP-Technical-Whitepaper-...</a>",1326344284

3455108,comment,3454118,3454526,1,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"> To be perfectly honest, that's a great way of describing how he feels about homosexuals ...<p>That he is <i>fearful</i>? That he feels the same emotion that one might experience from a giant hairy spider, or cancer, or a bottle of nitroglycerin? Not liking something, or not wanting it to be public policy, does not make someone fearful.<p>> the fact that OSC has some incredibly harmful views on society that should not be tolerated.<p>It's a fact that a lot of the homosexual leadership leads lives of debauchery and wanton disregard for consequences. It is not harmful to suggest that perhaps they should not be given free reign to rewrite family and marriage law, nor indoctrinate schoolchildren.<p>Now this is being discussed in the context of a religious leader (Card) rallying the troops (Mormons). The Mormons are a religion with a fanatical devotion to procreation, children, and families. When a bunch of slick Hollywood queers try to move marriage in the direction of being a frivolous indulgence, the internal Mormon rhetoric is naturally going to run towards the revolutionary. (And it is not idle talk. In a fantasy world where the lunatic wing of the queer movement gets their wishes on marriage laws, Utah probably <i>would</i> secede from the U.S.)",1326344230

Marino essentially wants is for Google to build a Shazam-like service that doesn’t just identify a song by “listening” to it, but also determines if whoever playing that song has the legal right to do so. Thus, this anti-pirate-Shazam would have to determine from the musical signature of a song such things as whether it came from an iTunes or Amazon MP3 or a CD. And not only that, it would have to determine whether or not the MP3 or CD is a legal or illegal copy.</i><p>This isn't as hard as the author is making it sound and I suspect Youtube already handles it with movie clips.  With the aid of an external ""copyright registry"", Google could see if the fingerprint of an unknown song is close to one in the registry.  Obviously, there would be many false positives and true negatives, but that is certainly true with child porn detection as well.

3455083,comment,3453095,3454065,4,0,saras,,,"While notaddicted's reply can also be useful to you, I think the part of the puzzle that you are missing is ""georeferencing"". From your example, with a raster (bitmap, image) map of the US: the part where you start connecting that to lat/lon is georeferencing. Essentially, you want to tie a spatial reference to your image, so that the raster's state boundaries will correspond to state boundaries on a ""real"" map. You can think of it as pinning an image you know nothing about to a map you do know something about, and then copying the information from known to unknown.<p>There are plenty of ways to georeference an image. The easiest would be to use something like QGIS or GRASS (both opensource GIS software). You will need existing spatial data to base your (as of now, non-spatial) map on: a shapefile of the state boundaries would work great.<p>Once you've wrapped your head around georeferencing and the idea of spatial vs nonspatial data, you will probably get more out of the mapsfromscratch tutorial.",1326343655

I was lucky to have taken a few computer science courses given me a bit of a foundation in CS theory (java programming, elementary algorithms, data structures).<p>Since graduating I've been working as a database developer (6 yrs now), specifically in data warehousing doing lots of PL/SQL coding for back-end ETL processing and occasionally front-end web/database applications. For a while now I've been finding that I'm far more interested in the work involving building database driven applications and now I want to extend and apply this passion to more traditional areas of software development.<p>I've done research online to come up with some first action steps to catch up on theory and start to practice coding.<p>1) Study following texts.<p>* Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\n* The C Programming Language\n* The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs<p>2) Simultaneously work through Python coding tutorials and look into solving as many online challenges, problems using Python.<p>3) Once reaching comfortable level of understanding of Python, start participating in open source projects, leveraging existing knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, mySQL combined with Python.<p>4) A few months down the line begin serious study of algorithms via Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen) & MIT 6.006 opencourse. Need to brush up on some discrete math but I think prior exposure to advanced mathematics and basic algorithms from my undergrad will come in handy.<p>So at moment I could use some direction on following:<p>1) Does the above learning plan look ok? Any other readings, concepts, practice to consider optimizing my time and opportunities?<p>2) I'm in a dilemma in that I want to leave my current job asap as I'm not gaining anything that will help move me towards software development (not to mention how boring, unchallenging it is), yet I don't have the practical experience on the resume to apply for programming positions. What to do? Ideally I would like to get a position which I can leverage my background in databases/data warehousing, like data services engineering (Amazon for example has several positions in this regard), and transition from there but even those need some work experience in java/c++. If I pick up minor open source work on the side in the following months, how far can that get me in being considered for development positions? Any other paths I should consider?",1326343485

I normally am not very picky with definitions and appropriate derived meanings, but the different usages of amateur are in complete contrast to each other and frequently hinders communication.  The typical reference of ""amateur"" X competing with ""professional"" X is not for the less skilled or less capable.  It's from those that can, but choose not to derive their income from that activity.  There are MANY people who have hobbies that they are profoundly amazing at but cannot do as a means of income.  Whether it's not being able to do it on demand to not wanting to lose the joy of doing it because it's required, it does not signify a lack of discipline or capability.  These are the amateur's people are talking about.  Not just those that are wanting to do it but haven't found a way to ""break in"".  For a good example, hit up any hole in the wall jazz club.

This is especially salient for programmers, as I'm sure you know - nobody is trying to get paid for time working on linux, although they are still doing work and putting in hours that they could be billing for.<p>I'm not trying to devalue anyone's work or property, and if they insist that it all has value, it all belongs to them, and everyone should have to pay for it, that's fine.

Rather than trying to make money off every tiny piece of work you put out there, why not open source some of your work. For the good of the community. Sure, you will be losing some profit by doing this, but more people will be able to enjoy your work, and I think that's more valuable.<p>The author of the original article does not think this, and I understand that.

For a while now, I've had a big idea which has been driving my motivation to learn to hack and create web servers. At this point of my programming life, I feel that I have a strong grasp of foundational computing knowledge and an apprentice understanding of MVC and noSQL architectures. I'm also well versed in python, though I could definitely stand to learn a thing or two. For the most part, I am a lonely hacker and work with non-profit organizations who have little to no understanding of the Internet and computers. So I have spent most of my spare time for the past five years writing code and experimenting and about year of hacking to put food on my table.<p>But,\nI do not yet feel that I can accomplish this project alone, and it is much bigger than me.<p>I call it the Street Performer License, but that's up for discussion as well. In fact, as I explain it, I hope that some keen HNers can help me understand what flaws I would need to work out.\nWithout further ado, here's how I envision it:<p>Imagine a website or application marketplace in which a series of tv shows, music albums, and software (including games) are purchased in amounts that the customer decides, and once the product has reached a set amount of revenue it is downloadable for no fee. Collections would still be open, but all costs would be deferred to the artists  at that point. For the initial round of funding, a set percentage would go into a collective pool for future projects, a <i>small</i> percentage to the publisher for hosting fees, and cost-of-living expenses (optimally, accounting would be entirely transparent). People would be allowed advance copies of material if they made a certain contribution (say, $5 for an album, $10 for a movie or tv series, and $15 for a game or other software).  And although these advances would likely be pirated, there is still enough of a market to undertake even the more expensive projects.<p>I have been speaking with a lot of local artists (local == Vancouver) and they are quite keen to sign up on something like this. I'm sure that this could further bridge relations between hackers and artists.<p>I'm actually shaking as I write this, because I really wanted to develop this idea to help out my current non-profit (the Vancouver Community Network, I won't plug further; please feel free to google), but now tonight I've realized how much bigger it is than me.<p>If you're interested in helping out with this project, I've started a gdoc here:<p>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-G7uUazq--HYRCRbXfbDKFJb8GZ3yH55lDWmlcXq2Po/edit<p>I know that you aren't supposed to start with a group when you have an idea like this, but I also know that I want to see ProtectIP, SOPA, and any other Orrin Hatchesque/Victorian IP models become obsolete, and I could really use your support. Help me with my vision of a world in which artist, programmers, engineers, and scientists can all make a decent living without resorting to harmful IP practices.<p>Thanks for your time,<p>~foenix",1326342417

I'm lucky to have a great job, a great apartment right in the middle of downtown Cambridge, and a few friends who will be spending their summer in the Boston area, so hopefully the transition won't be too hard.<p>However, I'm still mildly worried about finding things to do, meeting new people, etc.  I'm a fairly social person, but I've had the luxury of being around people my own age on a daily basis for most of my life, and now I'll be the youngest guy at my job by a number of years.  I'm not saying that I won't be able to hang out with my coworkers, but when most of them have kids it may be hard to connect on a personal level.<p>So my question to HN is what advice do you guys have on finding a new circle of people, both in the personal and professional sense, especially after moving somewhere new.  Also, if you happen to be from Boston I wouldn't object to specific recommendations ;-).<p>Thanks!",1241582404

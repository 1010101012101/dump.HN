People at my church\nare like a family for me. And I find it like that almost everywhere I meet\nchristians. I get the same support, feeling of belonging, etc. that I would get in\na family.<p>Also, &quot;How to make friends and influence people&quot; is a good book I recommend\n(started reading it recently).<p>And like someone else said, try talking to someone new every day.

It&#x27;s not an uncommon thing to struggle with, a lot of people have it this way - introvert or not.<p>My tip would be to get involved in some activities you like, sports or otherwise. That way you&#x27;ll meet new people, that you interact with in that setting. Of course, taking it from that setting to other settings can be the hard part, but after a while when you get to know people you&#x27;ll see who you&#x27;re getting a long the best with. A simple question like &quot;So, what are you doing this weekend?&quot; can go a long way.<p>Meeting friends is a bit like hooking up with girls and dating in general. Find the ones you get a long with well, don&#x27;t come off too needy and then make a suggestion when the time is right.",1402916314

7898294,comment,7895504,7897857,2,0,twic,,,"You can&#x27;t do it directly, but there is a standard idiom for doing something like that - define the interface like this:<p><pre><code>  interface Functor<A, R extends Functor<A, R>>\n</code></pre>\nAnd then in the implementing class, bind R to the implementing class:<p><pre><code>  class Option<A> implements Functor<A, Option<A>>\n</code></pre>\nHowever, this doesn&#x27;t let you write an actual functor. Try to write the map method on it:<p><pre><code>    class Option<A> implements Functor<A, Option<A>> {\n        private final A value;\n    \n        public Option(A value) { this.value = value; }\n    \n        @Override\n        public <B> Option<A> map(Function<A, B> fn) {\n            // er, i want to return an Option<B>, not an Option<A>\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that you don&#x27;t want to return an instance of the type of the receiver, you want to return an instance of a similar type with a different type parameter (Option<B> rather than Option<A>).<p>You would be absolutely fine if your functions were functions from values of some type to other values of that type (eg functions from integers to integers), because then A = B and you can get away with this. But there&#x27;s no way to extend this hack to let you return an Option<B> from map.<p>The closest you can get in Java is probably this:<p><pre><code>    interface Functor<A, R extends Functor<?, R>>\n\n    class Option<A> implements Functor<A, Option<?>> {\n        private final A value;\n    \n        public Option(A value) { this.value = value; }\n    \n        @Override\n        public <B> Option<?> map(Function<A, B> fn) {\n            return new Option<B>(value != null ? fn.apply(value) : null);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThere, you leave the element type of the returned functor undefined, as a wildcard, which lets you slip an Option<B> out as a return value.<p>The problem with that is that it&#x27;s useless. Given:<p><pre><code>        Option<String> x;\n        Function<String, Integer> fn;\n</code></pre>\nThen mapping the function over the option gives you:<p><pre><code>        Option<?> y = x.map(fn);\n</code></pre>\nAn Option<?>. Which is no use to man or beast, because it&#x27;s lost the type information.<p>What you really want to be able to write is:<p><pre><code>  class Option<A> implements Functor<A, Option<_>>\n</code></pre>\nWhere the underscore is borrowed from Scala to mean &quot;nothing to see here, move along please&quot;, and leaves that reference to Option in its unbound form. And then have a way of binding it right in the definition of the map function. But that&#x27;s higher-kinded types, and Java doesn&#x27;t have that.<p>If you were absolutely desperate to do this in Java, like if terrorists burst in and put a gun to your head and told you to do it, you could restore the type information by pebble-dashing the functor with some simple reflection:<p><pre><code>    interface Functor<A, R extends Functor<?, R>> {\n        <B> R map(Function<A, B> fn);\n        <B> Functor<B, R> as(Class<B> b);\n    }\n\n    class Option<A> implements Functor<A, Option<?>> {\n        // other stuff as above\n    \n        @Override\n        public <B> Option<B> as(Class<B> b) {\n            return new Option<B>(b.cast(value));\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhich, given the above definitions of x and fn, lets you write:<p><pre><code>        Option<Integer> y = x.map(fn).as(Integer.class);\n</code></pre>\nAnd even the same thing but typed as functors, to show you there&#x27;s nothing up my sleeve:<p><pre><code>        Functor<String, Option<?>> fx = x;\n        Functor<Integer, Option<?>> fy = fx.map(fn).as(Integer.class);\n</code></pre>\nAnd as a separate function which contains no mention of the concrete functor class anywhere (although it does still need a type token for the result functor&#x27;s parameter):<p><pre><code>    private <A, B, F extends Functor<?, F>> Functor<B, F> applyAbstractly(Functor<A, F> fx, Function<A, B> fn, Class<B> b) {\n        return fx.map(fn).as(b);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut to be honest, all of this is a bit like trying to carve a fine wooden sculpture with a chainsaw. If you want to do this, don&#x27;t use Java. If you want to use Java, don&#x27;t do this.",1402916278

I was in a similar situation as yours for several years (new to the country and culture). However my English was very fluent. Never had any problem with holding a good conversation with anybody. However, it didn&#x27;t matter. Friendships are formed based on what you have in common with the other person. The commonality comes from growing up in the same country and culture - having watched the same movies and TV shows, having same childhood heroes etc. No matter how hard you try you can&#x27;t overcome these limitations because you can&#x27;t change the past. Once I figured this out, I began to realize that I would effortlessly form friendships with people who are most similar to me (education, background, culture, nationality etc.). And with people who I didn&#x27;t have much in common with - no matter how hard I tried, we could not be friends. So I stopped trying too hard and stopped being needy. My closest friends are still the ones I formed back in my own country who now live here.

I do not even have roommates.<p>This is fine most of the time, but it&#x27;s really painful on times when I have a lack of self-confidence.

I used to be an introvert white guy with no friends.<p>I see two ways of meeting people, with 1 rule required:\nThe Rule: Always say the first opinion that comes to your mind. Do not be afraid to say what you really feel, and have an intelligent discussion about it later, in which you can admit you were ignorant and change your opinion.  Opinions are like belly buttons, everyone has one, and they&#x27;re mostly irrelevant.  Great friendships can be forged between people with totally opposite opinions.  You will be genuine as long as you speak your mind.<p>Corollary:  Take what you were just imagining in that public social situation, grab your balls, and do it.  Reality either smacks you in the face and you have to handle an unknown situation, or all of a sudden it&#x27;s serendipity.  (P.S. This works exactly the same way on dates, too.)<p>Meet people:\n1. Use workmates or the internet to meet people (meetup.com/okcupid/tinder/etc.) -  it&#x27;s a good crutch to transitioning to real life approaching strangers, without any risk of blushing or doing something else embarrassing.  You&#x27;ll later find out, even in &quot;structured&quot; situations you&#x27;ll do embarassing things anyway, so maybe you should skip to #2:\n2. Walk up to those groups (assuming it&#x27;s a safe environment), interrupt and introduce yourself.  Speak your English wrong, don&#x27;t let the people get to you, just keep pushing your level so you always say exactly what you mean, in a direct and efficient way (because English works like this).  Your purpose is to develop your language/social skills, not impress them.  Feel free to be transparent with them, and explain why you&#x27;re talking to them - who knows what they&#x27;ll do!<p>You see the above text?  That is how I taught myself fluent spoken Chinese on the streets of China starting with _zero_ Chinese.  The strategy completely works, but it&#x27;s not easy.

Try to talk to someone new every day.<p>On item 1 - I promise that it&#x27;s not as lame as the title makes it sound. If you internalize the core advice behind this book it will drastically improve your life and it will make you a better person.<p>On item 2 - don&#x27;t go overboard with this. There&#x27;s no need to go outside of your comfort zone. Instead just try stretching it a little. To get started don&#x27;t walk up to people out of the blue and just start talking to them. Instead if you happen to be near someone, just make some observational remark to them and see how it plays out. Or alternatively if you&#x27;re wondering about something, ask the person next to you. The goal shouldn&#x27;t be to befriend every stranger you meet - but instead to have a very short chat and move on with your day. I recommend doing this while reading that book because it&#x27;ll give you a chance to experience and observe some (most) of the things he talks about.<p>Finally, you mentioned wanting to meet some ladies. Assuming that you mean you&#x27;re looking to &quot;play the long game&quot; and find someone to settled down with, I&#x27;d strongly advise <i>actually</i> playing the long game. Don&#x27;t make meeting women the focus of your social life. Instead focus on making substantiative friendships first and the relationship thing will sort itself out without much effort. That said, don&#x27;t be too selective as far as gender goes. Don&#x27;t avoid hanging out with guys because you think you won&#x27;t meet girls, and definitely don&#x27;t be that guy who only befriends girls just because you want to date them. If you do befriend a girl who you&#x27;d rather be dating, be honest with yourself and her as to what your intentions are. Remember that friendships aren&#x27;t leverage and you&#x27;ll do fine.<p>Edit:<p>One last thing... I&#x27;m not sure that this will help any, but language is really tricky. I&#x27;m an American living in New Zealand. I&#x27;m sure my language issues pale in comparison, but I am constantly second-guessing myself. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m worried that people won&#x27;t understand me, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;d rather communicate in a way that&#x27;s natural to the people who are listening to me -- I&#x27;m sure you can relate. What I&#x27;d say is that while there are a whole host of issues due to you being a non-native English speaker, there are a lot more issues that come from you being in a different country. Personally I&#x27;d advise focusing on the latter type of differences (they&#x27;re more fun to me, anyway), and the language differences will follow. In turn, discussing those kinds of things with people is a great way to make friends.",1402913850

I would if I could, and I try my best in my own small corner of it.<p>Because I was, for four years, a regular long form writer, and later a bi-weekly columnist, in the most prestigious weekly magazine supplement in my own small country, I can actually provide some first hand perspective. The newspaper the magazine belonged to was the NYT of my country, and &quot;enjoyed&quot; a readership of just a little over 100,000. That isn&#x27;t enough to keep the paper going (it&#x27;s still around, but it&#x27;s uncertain for how long).<p>Obviously everything is on a spectrum. While I expressed myself in black and white terms in my first comment, my point is that there is little correlation between quality and success, and I stand behind it. The fact that some quality writers and musicians achieve some level of success -- some of them enjoy quite a great deal of it -- is not enough to change the overall picture. A newspaper isn&#x27;t an individual writer or artists. It&#x27;s a big business with very high costs. Modest success enjoyed by a writer is total failure for a newspaper, because a newspaper needs some specific measure of financial success in order to break even. For a newspaper, the outcome is often binary: live or die. It can&#x27;t generate a side income like an artist could.<p>As to the last paragraph of your comment: I agree, but that has little bearing on the matter at hand. I love popular art, and I enjoy popular news outlets (like Gawker) immensely. But I wasn&#x27;t saying that the people creating popular art aren&#x27;t smart or talented. I was merely questioning whether highbrow art or journalism is economically viable. As far as art goes, we know the answer: it isn&#x27;t. Pretty much every art museum in the world and every opera troupe is state supported. This may or may not be the case for journalism as the NYT practices it.<p>As a matter of fact, I&#x27;m not even lamenting the state of affairs. I was simply reeling against the assumption that popularity is any sign of quality; that&#x27;s all.<p>To add a little more information about the paper business -- to those interested -- I&#x27;ll explain that a newspaper survives by cross-subsidizing reporters. You maintain a bureau in France and one in Iraq. When there&#x27;s something interesting going on in Iraq, people buy the paper to read about that. When something happens in Europe, people buy it for that. But the cost of the paper stays the same, and it&#x27;s not a price anyone would pay for a single article. Once you unbundle the package and allow people to read (and generate revenue) for a single article, the entire business model becomes unsustainable. You simply can&#x27;t pay for the guy in France with the little money generated by the guy in Baghdad. Saying something like &quot;you should produce more interesting content&quot; misses the whole point of how a newspaper works. You can produce all the interesting &quot;content&quot; in the world, but you still won&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on in Europe or Iraq. You can&#x27;t have &quot;unbundled&quot; beat reporting (although you can have unbundled, occasional, long-form magazine assignments), because maintaining eyes and ears somewhere requires a constant cost whether or not there are good stories there at the moment.",1402913565

A good way to do this is meeting someone for coffee explicitly to practise English. Either they can learn your language in return, or you buy them the coffee, obviously! :)<p>(edit: situations where you can do this!

You could use a conventional keyboard and mouse to navigate the 2D space (with perhaps mouse movement assisted or replaced by hand/head/eye tracking), and drag windows between screens, set programs to open on certain ones, with full screen clipping to screen edges - all basically as many OSes do already.<p>But because they&#x27;re virtual, you could resize, split and merge screens, curve large ones, have ones which float in front of your vision to use for toolbar windows and HUDs. You could even use existing technology like VMs or VNC to use multiple OSes at the same time.<p>Mount your keyboard and mouse to a swivel chair which tilts, and you could comfortably have a 360 degree working area (assuming you can touch type) 4 or so screens deep, which would put traders&#x27; setups to shame (and at a fraction of the price).

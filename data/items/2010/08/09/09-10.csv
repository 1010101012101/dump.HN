However: AFAIK the existing algorithm, which they used, has not been proven to solve the problem optimally. It has now been shown that it can solve any position in at most 20 moves, but there's still the chance it solves a position in 20 moves that could optimally be solved in 19. Because the upper bound of 20 moves coincides with the proven lower bound of 20 moves, we know God's number. That does not mean that this must be God's algorithm.",1281347917

In fact, when my eldest daughter was born, I bought a CD (""Music to Be Born By"", by Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead) designed for this specific purpose.<p>My point is that there is pretty broad agreement that 2 year olds do not have conscious memories of birth or in utero life, of the nature described by the OP's anecdote.

The primary sources for vegans are nuts/seeds, and legumes. If you can't cook, it's very hard to eat legumes- have you ever tried eating a raw pinto bean? They are literally hard as rocks. Plus they cannot be found across the globe. Nuts and seeds are very seasonal, leaving man high and dry in certain seasons, and it's much much more of a challenge to harvest 6+ oz of nuts every day than it is to buy a jar of them at the store.",1281344989

Are my PhDs strictly greater in IQ than my hot dog sellers? Maybe, maybe not. But will, say, 99% of my PhDs have a higher IQ? I'd bet on that number or something like it.<p>> No, people from 2000 years are just as smart as you and me.<p>No, they were not. There were a few geniuses back then, the ones we still read and write books about. All few tens of thousands of them out of billions. But the average was vastly below the modern-day.<p>The environmental causes alone are legion: lead plumbing, no formal schooling (worth something like 5-10 IQ points), rampant parasitic diseases of every conceivable sort, irregular or poor nutrition with nutritional deficits (protein deficiency damaging early neurological development - low myelination of nerves, iodine deficiency, etc.), medicine that would kill most patients...<p>Your only valid points are that IQ is not perfectly correlated with success and that it varies within every group.

2013938,comment,2013454,2013784,0,0,js2,,,"They are just numbers. Here's how it works. The version number is four parts: major.minor.build.patch.<p>major.minor are used for each significant release and are set for marketing purposes. They are currently on a 12-week release cycle, where major is updated for each cycle.<p>build.patch are used for engineering purposes. They update the build value daily on trunk. Periodically, they create a release branch from trunk. On release branches, the build portion of the version is fixed and the patch value is incremented daily.<p>So for example, the upcoming release will be 9.0.597.something. Typically it takes them a couple weeks to get from beta to stable, so I expect 9.0 stable to be something like 9.0.597.33.<p>But, as I said, they're just numbers. :-)",1292536788

The thing getting you down is the way people misuse the down vote.<p>Disagreeing with something is no reason to down vote a comment.

2013934,comment,2013346,2013765,0,0,igravious,,,"That's interesting, isn't it? I think this proportionality is related to a quirk of human perception. If you are shown briefly a set of objects the average person is able (at a glance) to quickly count those objects for a low value whose threshold is around six or seven. Thus when the number goes any higher the individual will respond that there were ""less than ten"" or ""fewer than ten"". Of course because humans have standardized on base 10 as there counting system then ten will get bumped up in any distribution but to predict that it would occur between six and seven (the number of man and divinity no less) would be difficult.<p>What about 11 to 20? Hmm, it (roughly) goes: twenty, twelve, fifteen, eleven, eighteen, fourteen, sixteen, thirteen, seventeen, nineteen! Just what I expected :)",1292536760

Whether that exposure could be turned into profits was what was questioned in the 90s.<p>Bookmarking is different. I'm going to offend some people here by whipping out my anecdotal evidence: I don't know _any_ non-technical (read: average) users who are interested in maintaining a bookmark library, even if the benefits were explained to them.<p>On the slim chance that we could somehow convince them that it was worthwhile, I still can't see most of them being interested in browsing tag clouds and bookmark trees of other users, which they would have to do in order to be exposed by this 'ultra-specific' advertising. Anything beyond using it as a regular browser bookmark menu that syncs across computers is pretty unlikely in my opinion.<p>Why not just check Facebook to see what people are looking at? Or, for the 'geekier' of the mainstream, just check Twitter.<p>xMarks, a bookmarking service with 2million+ users, in their going away blog post[1] alluded to this same barrier:<p>> We built it and it put it front of potential advertisers.

Only in cases where the accusations can be proven false is making such an accusation illegal. Personally I think that's a fine system and would be sufficient to keep people mostly honest when reporting others using this app. There is not a whole lot of reason to use a traffic app to try and harm someone when so many more direct means are available.<p>> The DMV will provide that information to the insurance company after any fines are paid or court decisions are rendered but they are not the legal authority.<p>Then I imagine they will just discard the reports, and no harm has been done.<p>> What's to stop your ex girlfriend and her six friends from each reporting you over the course of a month or two for traffic violations to screw with you?<p>What to stop them from scratching your car just to screw with you? People can hurt you and there is nothing you can do about it. Fortunately they choose not to most of the time.<p>> Absolutely not, the employer has advertised that they want to know about bad driving by placing the sticker on the vehicle and the employee has accepted that as part of their employment.<p>I meant when there is no such sticker. Even if the desire to know was not advertised, I believe it would be morally fine to report bad driving of a company vehicle to the entity liable for loss associated with the vehicle. As for the rest of your response, even though you pointed out a number of technical distinctions, I do not see a moral one.<p>> seems to fit the description of vigilantism . . .<p>Still no.

When you report a traffic violation to law enforcement they are going to either investigate themselves or expect you to be able to positively identify the driver and show up in court. This gives the other driver the ability to defend themselves as well as forcing you to prove your statement. None of those requirements exist in the system described.<p>> ... especially when its recipient is a legal authority...<p>The DMV is not a legal authority for processing traffic violations. Law enforcement and the courts are. The DMV will provide that information to the insurance company after any fines are paid or court decisions are rendered but they are not the legal authority.<p>> ...  someone who might be liable for the bad behavior reported<p>The insurance companies would probably love to get reports about bad behavior of their drivers so that they could more aggressively adjust rates however they would still have to deal with the fact that there's really no way to prove that any of these complaints are legitimate. What's to stop your ex girlfriend and her six friends from each reporting you over the course of a month or two for traffic violations to screw with you? How does this application or your insurance company filter that information out? Going off of actual cited/fined traffic violations seems to be a much more secure accounting method.<p>> Is informing an employer of an employee's unsafe driving vigilantism?<p>Absolutely not, the employer has advertised that they want to know about bad driving by placing the sticker on the vehicle and the employee has accepted that as part of their employment. The driver of that vehicle however is not absolved of any legal responsibility by also being accountable to their employer, that is a separate deal. You have no obligation to report bad drivers to their employers and may instead go straight to law enforcement. One of the benefits of those programs is to keep law enforcement from becoming involved in the first place and can be considered liability mitigation.  This is not the same as side stepping law enforcement and going straight to the insurance company of a driver, in fact this application would be like skipping the employer and reporting the driver to the employers liability insurer for the report.<p>> Because the actors in that case have analogous financial and moral roles as the ones in this.<p>The employer and the insurance company have analogous financial and moral roles however they have no authority to enforce traffic laws. Employers have an incentive for you to bypass law enforcement, other drivers on the road don't.<p>There is already a legal process for dealing with these issues and an application that goes around them to mete out punishment seems to fit the description of vigilantism as you've provided it.",1292534520

I worked on a service in 2005 that was suppose to compete with del.icio.us, but our service never got off the ground.

Many, many duplicates have been found, and many, many more items have been cross-referenced.  So often the same story is reported again and again from different sources, and while this isn't a bad thing in itself, my personal belief is that the resulting divided discussions is a waste of time and effort.  And wasted time is something I hate.<p>I come to HN for high-quality links, and even more high-quality discussion, and anything that dilutes that discussion is, to me, a bad thing.<p>I originally intended to run the DupDetector for a week, but after 5 1/2 days there's enough information to tell me what I want.  The thing that has caught me by surprise is the way it has had such widely differeing reactions.  Some people have accused me of ""a novelty account"", something I'd never heard of, but which appears to be associated with Reddit.  I thought of it more as a robot assistant.<p>In particular, I thought more people would be interested in the technology and the hacking.  More than anything it's the lack of a response on that level that's made me pause.<p>And the final factor is today, when DupDetector's karma has fallen from 27 to 12.  I don't care about the karma, but it's an indication of people's feeling about the exercise.<p>I'll run it for just a few hours longer as I tidy things up, but basically  I'm stopping, explaining, and I'll see what the response is.  I thought it would be, and it would be thought to be, cool, interesting and useful.<p>Maybe I've misjudged my audience.  I am reviewing the situation.",1292533387

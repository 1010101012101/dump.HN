    "" I certainly hope that this gibberish isn't taken to be sufficient details for someone to implement.""

    ""isn't this patent a little bit too reaching and isn't the logic a little bit too obvious to be worthy of patent?""
</code></pre>
It's very clear from basically every single comment on this story that most of you have no clue about the patent system nor what to actually look for when sizing up a patent. I've picked just a few comments that demonstrate the general ignorance that can be seen here (this is not an insult, but people need to understand when they do not understand something and aren't qualified to comment).<p>I'd love for someone to reply with a citation that shows that just claim 1 is not novel, or is not inventive. To meet this criteria, the citation must either disclose ALL THE FEATURES LISTED IN THE CLAIM or it must be OBVIOUS to produce SOMETHING EXACTLY AS CLAIMED based on one or more PRIOR ART documents. It is not sufficient that all the features be in a single citation, but it must be obvious to actually come to the same invention AS CLAIMED.<p>So if someone could please find for me one or more citations which combined (and under Australian law it must be obvious to do so) which contains:<p>A method for a computer system to interpret an input from a user and generate a response, comprising:<p>1) receiving a user input;<p>2) converting the user input into an input array comprising rows and columns having a plurality of concepts;<p>3) determining if any of the plurality of concepts in the input array is derived from a root concept;<p>4) if any of the plurality of concepts is derived from a root concept, replacing each such derived concept with the corresponding root concept, identifying one or more related concepts that relate to the root concept, and generating a multi-dimensional array based on the input array that includes the one or more related concepts;<p>5) generating one or more additional multi-dimensional arrays, based on the input, containing any composite concepts, each derived from two or more concepts contained in the original array;<p>6) marking one or more concepts in the multi-dimensional arrays as essential based on application-specific criteria;<p>7) correlating a plurality of concepts in the multi-dimensional array to a plurality of first elements in a database by comparing a plurality of linear arrays derived from the multidimensional array to the plurality of elements in the database, wherein the first elements in the database includes a link to a second element in the database do not comprise possible responses;<p>8) determining a plurality of possible responses to the user input based on the correlation of the multi-dimensional array and the plurality of elements in the database<p>9) and generating a response to the user input.<p>There's 9 broad concepts here, and to my knowledge, at least 3, 4, 5 and 7 seem non-obvious to me, but my AI background is weak. Even if they are known, is it known to combine ALL those features in the way claimed? I'd be surprised if it were, the USPTO is actually quite good at searching in general.<p>It's so depressing to see a forum of people who are supposed to be intelligent and rational jumping to their guns at the mere mention of the word patent. Of course there are some junk patents, but those few should not be used to devalue the work done by inventors big, small or individuals around the world. If you don't even know how to read a patent, why do you feel like you're qualified to comment on their validity? We don't discredit academic papers because we've seen some of the words in their titles before, so why should patents be any different? It's dishartening to see such ignorance almost encouraged on Hacker News.",1370235334

At the heart of capitalism is any economic exchange- trading sheep for wheat, trading dollars for an xbox, etc.  For any trade to occur, each party in the trade has to believe that they will gain from the exchange, i.e. get increased utility/value from it.  By that means, any economic exchange where both parties are acting freely is most likely to be positive-sum, in terms of value received.  Where jobs have moved to poorer countries, real wages have increased- this is indicative of the fact that they are now able to produce goods and services that their trading counter-parties perceive to be more valuable.  This doesn't make rich countries as much worse off as you think it does- the majority of the increased production of poorer countries goes to meet local needs, overall having a relatively small effect on the price of global labor.<p>On your other point, I will agree with ya that our current income inequality is pretty bad.",1370234987

5811382,comment,5810392,5810569,1,0,rdtsc,,,"> I'm far more interested in conversations regarding where we are headed, rather than from whence we've came [1].<p>Interesting, I can think of a number of issues:<p>1) Rising inequality in the Western World. And the article you pointed out really shows the end result -- robots replacing people. That has been happening with industrialization for a while now. But now robots can build robots and the ones who will have the power will be the ones who will control the robots that build the robot factories. Kind of like meta robotics (I am sure there is a more defined term or concept that I am just not familiar with here). What happens to all the masses then. Robots make us food, do our work for us, and what do the average number of people do? State sponsored welfare? Just get a check every month enough to buy food and shelter and then play video games. There is thought that it actually wouldn't be that bad to have a direct subsidy like that but it would be a complete anathema  according to certain other political and economic principles. Resources will be become the final bottleneck? Maybe even with robots we can't grow enough corn.<p>2) Related to the above there is some notion of ""trickle-down"" effect. Not related to wealth necessarily but related to technology, where countries can jump from agrarian or tribal life straight to using cell phones. That's pretty interesting. Idealistic perhaps, as I doubt that in an of itself will make a dramatic difference in their quality of life but it is good to keep an eye on that. What happens if even the most poor eventually have access to smart phones? Does it help them put food on the table in the evening?<p>3) Related to 2) -- information becomes unchained. The real globalization happens when groups of citizens can communicate with each other directly rather than goings through official propaganda and power control channels. Sort of stuff we saw with Arab Spring, now Turkey. This is kind of stuff is really interesting. Apparent stability to a large state of revolt in <24hrs is pretty impressive.<p>4) Back-pressure starts building from entrenched interests (countries, governments, traditional gatekeepers). The idea that there is citizenship and you can't just move from one part of the world to another unless you are a large multinational corporation, is here now, does it make sense, who does it benefit? The desire to de-anonymize sharing of information. I can see cryptography becoming illegal in many contexts. DRM being shoved into more devices -- on one side yay, more people have access to information!"", on another, ""oh but they only get locked down controlled, filtered and monitored information coming from a few distribution channel monopolies"". Religious, nationalism, fear was/is a very good mass control lever. Maybe that won't work as well going forward? But what will?",1370233696

I did extremely well, while investing the minimum effort required.<p>My only secret for excelling at school was that my natural interests happened to coincide with the things school expects you to do. So I was intrinsically motivated to do most of them, and whenever intrinsically motivated people compete with extrinsically motivated people, it's hardly a competition at all.<p>Motivation dominates all other factors in learning. Nothing else comes close. People who <i>want</i> to learn something learn it orders of magnitude faster and more reliably than people who don't really care. Piles of psychological research back this up.<p>For example, if you actually wait to teach a child arithmetic until he or she expresses a genuine interest, a typical child can master all of elementary school math in about 20 hours of instruction. Reading is similar -- once the fire is lit, with a little phonetic guidance, a typical kid can become a fluent reader in weeks, not months.<p>So the real art of education becomes inspiring the desire, and then being ready to strike when the iron is hot. School actively thwarts this pattern.<p>> Second, the point of learning how to play the school system isn't to be good at school. It's to be good at handling systems in general. Different systems, different constraints, but there are meta-lessons to be learned in dealing with any of them.<p>That kind of general experience is something you get no matter what you're doing, so long as you're interacting with other human beings. The real question is whether school teaches better meta-lessons than other kinds of experience.<p>In school, all work is <i>simulated</i>. The worst and best possible outcomes are both abstract letters on a piece of paper. Contrast this with something as simple as putting a child in charge of planning a camping trip, and the variety of outcomes they'll experience and learn from.

Using free-floating blimps or aerostats seems like one of the simpler ways to put transmitters at sufficient altitude to increase coverage.<p>Additionally, from a business standpoint it may not seem like there's a lot of money in Africa but that's a very prejudiced sentiment, I think. Many parts of Africa are developing quickly, there is already money to be had there. Moreover, over the coming decades even more of Africa will develop. And by then Google will have the brand recognition, the connections, the good-will, and the operational experience to dominate the market providing services to a market of over a billion people.<p>Over the next several decades the economies of Africa will grow by trillions of dollars of GDP.

The stress of being treated as egg-laying machines causes hens to peck at themselves and others, ripping out feathers and eyes, a behavior that is unheard of in chickens raised outside of captivity. To prevent injury, most hens have their beaks are sliced off by a hot blade and without anesthetic. After laying about 300 eggs, her bones leached of calcium and often unable to walk, an egg-laying hen is killed for her flesh just a year after she is born.<p>For the more than 100 million male chicks every year, the day they hatch will be the last day of their lives. Unable to lay eggs and too small be sold as broiler chickens, male chicks have no commercial value and are gassed or ground alive at just one day old. Tragically this is a reality across all egg production; cage free or humane eggs are no different. The killing of male chicks and eventual slaughter of spent hens are standard industry practice and can only be avoided by rejecting eggs entirely.",1370233138

The authors build a well-presented case against homework for children younger than high-school age based upon their claims that there is little evidence that homework for younger children has any long or short term benefit.<p>The authors observe that homework is disruptive to family dynamics because it is an ongoing source of conflict between parents and their children. They also observe that the primary reason schools assign homework to younger children is because parents demand it. Both of these observations are consistent with my experience both within my own family and my observations of the families of my child's peers.<p>On the other hand, I have no way of verifying or denying the author's claims about homework studies failing to demonstrate long term benefits from homework.<p>Overall, I am glad I read it because it gave me some perspective on the issue.

It was generally understood that she considered them goof-offs and slackers, and didn't give good grades to guys even for really hard work. I was at a disadvantage in that class even before I walked in the door.<p>So rather than fight an uphill battle due to my gender, I spent an extra hour on the first report (a paper on Romeo and Juliet) and carefully drew hearts and a large rose in colored pencil on the cover page. I then proceeded to behave a smidge more effeminately than my natural self whenever speaking to her, and breezed through that year while my male classmates struggled, with my teacher convinced I was a persecuted homosexual.<p>I'm not convinced it was helpful in the long term, because the work I avoided in that class didn't do me any favors.

5811317,comment,5810993,5811182,4,0,sanjiallblue,,,"Look, I'm going to start this off by agreeing with you that the author has improperly associated all of Islam with these kinds of hatred and bigotries and it is a very peculiar article to be posted to this website.<p>The next part here gets tricky. Firstly, all Islam is not the same, but far-right fundamentalist Islam is pretty the same across the board and is hard to distinguish whether or not it's in the minority or the majority.<p>Given that the majority of the world's Muslims live in Southeast Asia, it's hard to distinguish Islam's cultural lean worldwide. So it makes much more sense to limit the issue to the kind of Islam our original poster is discussing (and indeed the kind most are discussing when breaching this issue), which is clearly Middle Eastern fundamentalist Islam.<p>Fundamentalist Islam is dangerous, just as the other fundamentalist Abrahamic faiths are of course. After all, according to the FBI there were more domestic terror attacks over the last decade in the United States separately by extremist Latin, Jewish and White terror groups than there were from all combined Muslim groups. The dangers from such extremism should be, and generally are, taken seriously in every Western nation.<p>Now, the encroaching push of Islamic values into Western society is largely a bogeyman. Speaking from a purely statistical standpoint, the West is becoming more and more secular and Islam isn't really doing anything to change that fact.<p>The general scare tactic used by Islamaphobes is the ""birth-rate"" of Muslims would increase therefore increasing the Muslim population in Europe (a non-issue for America). However, the Pew Research Center conducted a study that found the Muslim birth-rate is actually decreasing in Europe and will drop from the current 2.2 to 2.0 by 2030, while the non-Muslim population is expected to increase from 1.5 to 1.6 in that same time-frame. When you factor in the secularization that naturally occurs in Europe's religious population, then you're looking at the very most, a 1-1.5% increase in the practicing Muslim population in Europe by 2030, with an even smaller portion than that (less than 30%) holding onto the culture maladies of fundamentalism.<p>Now, long-term we can establish that it is very unlikely that Islam will have much, if any, impact on Europe in the long-run. There will be no ""Islamification"" of Europe (and especially not America since the numbers stateside are significantly lower than that of Europe combined with a significantly lower tolerance level for Islamic fundamentalism culturally and politically).<p>With that being said, this does not discount the threat a vocal minority to pose to any larger population that refuses to address its discriminatory practices. I don't take this young man's anecdotes as any form of evidence beyond what they are, anecdotal. But it bears asking the question of the place religious fundamentalism deserves to hold in the public square. Should their beliefs be met with xenophobia and bigotry? Of course not. But every European and American citizen is well within their rights to question the validity of both their beliefs and the methods by which fundamentalists wish to impose said beliefs.<p>To your point about defamation and rumor spreading being a ""sin"" in Islam. There is an insidious justification that fundamentalists use when engaging in defamation and backbiting. The Quran specifically states that if a person is guilty of the actions for which they are being defamed and slandered over, then it is not a sin in the eyes of God. Now, there is supposed to be a precondition under which the person spreading the rumor is supposed to do so only to clarify what is true and/or false, but in the eyes of these fundamentalists they've already judged the victim party guilty. This judgement is then verified in their gossipy clique of other fundamentalists. It's an Ouroboros of hatred and judgement that sadly is thrust mostly on women.<p>Now, this isn't a problem with ""Islam"" per se, but rather a problem with fundamentalism and specifically Middle Eastern cultural fundamentalism. The groups discussed in this young man's article certainly exist in Europe. It should be fairly obvious that outside of one corner of this one University there is little to no effective power these groups have as they're enjoying the protection afforded by a University clearly desperate to avoid controversy.<p>Of course, because of the original author's unwillingness to identify his University, there isn't much in the way of affirming any of this, so the best we can do is address the groups that do in fact exist. The best way to deal with such groups is to meet them with a firm secular humanist stand that encourages assimilation with the cultural norms of the country while respecting their freedom of religion (which stops the second it seeks to limit the freedom of others in America and most of Europe).<p>Those groups that do exist can pose a real threat, but it is unlikely they pose any more threat than any other extremist group. There are always the nuts and the disadvantaged being used and using others to accomplish the bizarre machinations of a deluded hive mind. But this isn't when fear should be entertained, but rather courage and an enduring passion for the dignity and improvement of all humanity.<p>At least, those are the lofty ideals I think the majority of us cosmopolitan youths wish to aspire toward. It's just important to remember that confirmation bias in situations of race and religion tend to get manifest quickly and on a subconscious level. Doing our best to mitigate how we let those biases affect our rational minds is probably the best we can wish for on a mass scale.",1370232479

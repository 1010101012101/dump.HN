Doing anything with all your soul -- pouring yourself into something -- is your job in life as far as I'm concerned. Pick whatever works for you. Whatever keeps you moving.<p>2) It also depends on what you envy. I envy people that have made a positive difference in people's lives. Other things seem kind of stupid to me, like money and fame. You can inherit money, or trick somebody out of it, so while it's nice, it's more like the scoreboard on a basketball game. You don't play basketball by looking at the scoreboard. Fame is too much a crap shoot. Plus I'd rather have freedom to invent and innovate than having the world watching my every move.",1188701309

49345,comment,49334,49341,0,0,rms,,,"Yes, it is feasible to do so. But in the same way that there is close to no shortage of volunteers for the current army, there would be no shortage of volunteers for the robot army. I sure as hell wouldn't volunteer to go to Iraq, but I'd be much more willing to control a robot or spy drone remotely. There's no personal risk.<p>In short, if war is fought in the far future the superior side won't have very many human soldiers, but the robots definitely won't be controlled by unsuspecting online gamers because they can just use paid remote soldiers.",1188700208

49343,comment,49313,49313,0,0,Neoryder,,,"I think as with most things it depends. Envy is closely related to pride , and if envy/pride drives us to create beautiful products to always push outside our comfort zones to make something beautiful/useful then I am all for it., But if with, I daresay most people ,envy drives them to do things beyond what decent people do.<p>IN short figure out how envy affects you. Honestly assess yourself and act accordingly.\n",1188700009

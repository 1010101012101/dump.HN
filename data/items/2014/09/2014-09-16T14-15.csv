But you also have to consider the fact that linux is the only reliable open source kernel which developers know how to use. The mere fact that&#x27;s  it&#x27;s both maintained, open source and used by many is a big feature. It doesn&#x27;t have to at the bleeding edge.<p>Even if it&#x27;s 70&#x27;s era tech, it&#x27;s still a good enough tech for many things. Its sole aim is not directly compete with proprietary kernels, it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s just cheaper and more free.<p>I wish minix would get more attention too, but I think kernel choices boils down to what hardware you have.",1410879557

8324788,comment,8261098,8277545,1,0,innguest,,,"> So... are you an anarchist, or just a big fan of small governments? :)\nI&#x27;m looking to minimize the amount of force used in the world. Increasingly smaller governments are in the right direction, and without central governments I believe we&#x27;d still organize ourselves in enclaves or archologies that would trade with each other.<p>> one problem with this approach is the small government [...] then keeps going until it&#x27;s a large government again\nPeople would only allow to be governed with explicit contracts and insurance in place. This gets into dispute resolution, which I&#x27;m still studying, but there are definitely ways to set incentives in place so that &quot;becoming a large government&quot; becomes a terrible course of action (economically, not just nominally and flexibly as is with law today).<p>> If they strike, or demonstrate, my police forces kill them\nYou can&#x27;t initiate force in a libertarian society, or you will be inviting problems/conflicts. It&#x27;s not economically advantageous to wage wars in a free society, so this won&#x27;t be chosen often. The reason people go to war is because they want to make money selling weapons. This model only works with fiat money (historically, as wars are usually much more expensive than anyone could pay for). Real money can&#x27;t pay for wars. Wars are really expensive.<p>Sundown towns were an explicit death threat to people who did not initiate force.<p>>  We tried it your way, more or less, back in the Gilded Age\nI&#x27;m reading a lot about the Gilded Age now and I&#x27;d really emphasize your &quot;more or less&quot;. There was a lot of government meddling in the market at the time (railroads: government land grants and subsidies; in 1873 the Coinage Act demonetized silver [this is a huge intervention], which raised interest rates [artificially, which is why it&#x27;s bad], which contributed to the first &quot;Great Depression&quot; until 1879). And that&#x27;s not even the beginning of government interventions within 1860-90.<p>The Gilded Age is not an example of the free market. I&#x27;m looking at Celtic Ireland for something more like it.",1410879431

The people who right these fast C/C++ programs that beat Java/C# are usally far more skilled and trained.<p>Any programmer who know neither language well and has to write a big application in it will probebly find java/c# far easier.<p>I remember a long blogpost where somebody set out to test this on himself. And that guy was a very good C++ programmer. He found that his C++ prgrogrammer was slower, but he then set on improving the speed and in the end beat java by quite a bit. However the amount of effort was completly unreasonable for most programmers.<p>So &quot;What gives&quot; is this, and this has been true for a long time. If you are a expert in a low level language and spend time optimizing you will probebly beat Java/C#.<p>I would suggest that you should look into what a JIT or GC can and can not do.

8324660,comment,8323970,8324385,3,0,peterwwillis,,,"That is one way of putting it. Another way is that you&#x27;re creating a new de facto standard and making sure everyone needs to use it. The partnerships you make build your product into other products, making it the default option for anything someone might need to do with containers. Then you increase the visibility of the product (and thus the company) by getting lots of PR and making sure VCs and potential customers read it.<p>But competition has nothing to do with open source. Source code is not a competitive advantage, even if you get minor quality improvements like increased code visibility and test coverage. No open source company has ever forked code from an existing product, started a competing business, and stolen business away from the originator. Companies that provide services on top of other people&#x27;s code, however, often fall victim to a better sales pitch, customized tailored services or a shift in direction.<p>And honestly, the idea that &#x27;the community&#x27; owns the Docker project is a joke. Is the community getting 40 million dollars? Is the community making the design decisions for the product? Is the community pushing the integration of your tool with other companies and services?

If you look at the wiki page [0] you see that the constant has a non-trivial relationship with a major mathematical question (&quot;what is the behavior of the prime numbers?&quot;) and, as you compute estimations of it within your computational ability it waves above and below its true value.<p>For things like e^i you almost cannot define the idea of complex powers without knowing the right concepts. The sqrt(2) example clearly converges toward 2 as you stack the tower. Binet&#x27;s formula was arrived at via derivation from the Fibonacci recursion formula... so anyone who had it would obviously know its significance.<p>So, to be clear, the only reason why those examples would look strange is if someone showed it to you (armed with only high school mathematics) without explanation.

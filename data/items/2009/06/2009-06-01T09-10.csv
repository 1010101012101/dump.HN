And I believe I learned quite a bit from it, as well, though I'm sure that is debatable.)",1243850220

What I'm wondering is if tools exist for automatically generating the client-side validation from the same rules that have been specified on the server side.  If one were to use the JQuery-based tool that the article submitter created, you'd have double the work, and making changes would risk introducing inconsistancies.",1243849745

The difference is quite stunning.<p>While I realize in the long term, you will need localized data for wherever you live for queries to be more useful, if you want to get a test of the technological platform and how it differs from google, chances are you wont see many until you set it to US-mode.",1243849261

635814,comment,635699,635778,0,0,chrismear,,,"Actually, one of the benefits of Git over, say, Subversion, is that it's much easier to hack away on multiple things, and then arrange a series of sensible, self-contained commits from your messy working directory.<p>It's not necessarily a great way to work at all times, but it's a handy facility to have. Personally I use it most in the early, somewhat experimental stages of a new feature or project, when I find it useful to mentally separate experimental hacking with organised committing.<p>For most things, though, I try to focus on one thing at a time, and here Git's quick-'n'-easy branching and merging helps out. Whenever I start something new, even if it's just fixing a minor bug, I'll create a new branch just for that work, often naming it after the ticket number in our issue tracking system. Then your being in that branch is a constant reminder of what you're supposed to be working on.<p>Ryan Tomayko has written a good article on these aspects of Git here: <a href=""http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git</a>",1243848507

But it also has limits - so to reach a next level we need to think how to incorporate design into that view.  Maybe if we are more strict with our methods we can make the design also easier to objectively evaluate and sort out those that don't meet the standards.",1243848379

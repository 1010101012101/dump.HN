The problem, though, is that I don't think this guy is perfect (he may well think the same of me), for various reasons.  Ok, no one is perfect, but I know people that I think would be ""about as good as you could get"" (unfortunately they aren't available), and this guy doesn't measure up.<p>Better to strike out on my own, or throw in my lot with someone who's perhaps not the right person?",1176990617

How did they cope with the problems that DBs solve?  Did they ever have to scale to more than one ""DB server""?<p>Cheers, Ralph.",1176990160

9370980,comment,9366906,9370746,0,0,derefr,,,"I&#x27;ve always liked the way the games industry approaches this: a &quot;game designer&quot; (at least in healthy companies) is a developer whose job is effectively to produce a continuous stream of <i>prototypes</i> that encode all the business logic. You can use the prototypes for smoke testing (in the games industry, seeing whether the resulting game is fun), but can also use them to write component-level contracts based on the observed properties of the prototype.<p>Once you have such an &quot;empirically-derived&quot; contract, you can then throw that over to a larger team of actual capital-E-Engineers, whose job is to make something obeying those same observed constraints (which are really quite detailed; they basically get to do TDD where many of the tests have been written for them), then apply actual engineering to the problem, to output another, non-prototype product.<p>This scales up: your stream of prototypes can come from a team, instead of an individual; and you can have as many people doing engineering as you want, because they have a stable set of requirements—translating a fixed, interactive spec (the prototype) into good code—that allows for simple, static top-down software architecture.<p>The interesting thing is that successive <i>prototypes</i> will tend to be frequently ground-up rewrites (because prototype code is unmaintainable, and is also small enough that there isn&#x27;t much lost in throwing it out.) The engineered product, meanwhile, will be a continuously-evolved codebase, where each new prototype marks the start of a new branch of development, new user stories and issue tickets, etc. Features might not always make it from an arbitrary successor prototype into the product!<p>Note also that the game designer not only <i>encodes</i> the requirements in their prototype, but is also the perfect place to lay the responsibility of <i>collecting</i> the requirements in the first place. Effectively, they&#x27;re acting as a tiny embedded start-up, pivoting around and trying to find product-market fit, where the &quot;market&quot; is internal to the company.<p>Or, another way to think about it: your &quot;features&quot; team is like a four-piece garage band producing music (or even, perhaps, one guy with a keyboard producing chiptunes.) Those songs are played to internal stakeholders, who decide whether they like them. Then, the approved songs get thrown over to an orchestra conductor (the given team&#x27;s engineering lead), whose job is to turn the motifs embedded in the piece into a symphony, and get their 100-odd performers to create a coherent, grandiose sound out of it.<p>A lack of understanding how to set up this kind of pipeline might be why (in the best cases, at least—let&#x27;s ignore the acquihire-and-disassemble cases) so many large companies choose to continually buy start-ups. Effectively, they&#x27;re doing the same thing we&#x27;re talking about here: taking a small team with a finished prototype, and then reimplementing it &quot;for real&quot; using their engineering talent. The problem being that there&#x27;s no support for the continued existence of the absorbed &quot;start-up&quot; mitochondrion within the host cell, so it only ever gets out the one product it was working on at the time it was acquired, rather than continuing to pump out new little ideas. (A great game-industry example: EA. They constantly buy fledgling game publishers, use their own engineering talent to produce a sequel or two, and then run out of steam because the people making up the creative engine that generated the original game designs have left, or have been reformed by their engineering culture into something non-startuppy that has no power to generate original products.)",1428964662

There is a lot of work (often very specialized work) that needs to get done, and it&#x27;s important to shield them from distractions. Investors generally tend to helicopter up -- they see our world/company from thirty thousand feet. It&#x27;s a totally different perspective that takes some time and experience to get used to. Even most CEOs have trouble shifting into this mindset. It requires an enormous context shift. For people who don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with this kind of thing, it can be dramatically harder to do it on a whim.<p>A minute ago you were sitting at your computer, trying to figure out a C++ boost error message, and now someone asks you &quot;how do you think the feature you&#x27;re working on will impact the company&#x27;s revenue in the next quarter?&quot; That can really throw people off. They might feel like they should have had a better answer. Investor conversations can seem extremely important to people who aren&#x27;t used to doing it on regular basis, and it can distract them from critical work. I think it&#x27;s good general practice to try and avoid it.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean undue paranoia -- if someone wants to talk to the investor (or the other way around), they&#x27;re welcome to. But I think being thoughtful about protecting your people that are neck deep in work from distractions is usually a good policy.",1428964519

But really giving someone back some fungible BTC is really just a matter of signing another transaction, which is already a primitive in the protocol or whatever.<p>The point of chargebacks is that they exist on all payments in the creditcard network.  When you pay with a creditcard you expect it, when you accept creditcard payments you do the same.  Chargebacks are also not mandatory for Visa/Mastercard networks.  For instance Maestro goes over the Mastercard network but settles much faster.  It still allows reimbursing invalid payments but it&#x27;s charged differently.<p>From a consumer point of view I think chargebacks need to be a strong element.  Bitcoin might get this separately, but it needs this as a strong consumer facing feature: &quot;this payment uses bitcoin insured&quot; or whatever you would call it.  Right now that does not exist and from my understanding, adding something like this would be nearly impossible to build, because chargebacks work as there are legal repercussions for misuse.<p>> .. even given the existence of physical limits? I suspect that a correct number is going to be &quot;a system that allows any transaction to occur, but that prioritizes settlement&quot; or something. This is the sort of problem that deserves stochastic simulation methinks.<p>Physical limits in what environments?  Bitcoin right now does not survive a network partition which I think is a problem.  Other systems exist that can allow subsets of the network to trade with each other and clear at a later point when the network heals.  I don&#x27;t argue for crazy things, I&#x27;m just arguing that Bitcoin cannot compete with already existing systems when it comes to scaling up to that level and providing the same level of service.<p>> Huh, actually I still disagree with you. So, I would argue that the current banking systems are using a different technical system for securing their accounts. They are not using decentralized consensus. They are not using &quot;distributed systems&quot;. They are using something very different. They do not have to worry about replication failures or sybil nodes. Ripple, Stellar and Bitcoin all claim to, and I suspect only Bitcoin does based on my examination of their implementations and consensus mechanisms... [as elaborated in that link]<p>Banks have to deal with consensus as well if they engage in correspondence banking.  Bitcoin attempts to guarantee that funds exist whereas banks don&#x27;t do that.  They send numbers around that are not based on anything.  I think that&#x27;s a big difference in philosophy more than anything else.  Stellar and Ripple just attempt to modernize that aspect, provide it with a standardized protocol and replace humans with computers and to make it easier for new companies to participate in the network.<p>> Hmm that is an interesting claim. Do payment channels count as rewriting transactions? This is where transactions are replaced with successor transactions before they are confirmed in a block in the history. (my 2 second summary)<p>How would you go about tracking those payments then?  As bitcoin has no real confirmation system for payments the current best bet you have is making an address up and waiting until something arrives there and then to wait for some amount of time until you can be reasonably sure that the money belongs there.  With the Mastercard network right now (from my understanding) I can sever the links between Austria and the rest of the world, and I can still clear transactions from an Austrian account to an Austrian account and once the rest of the network reappears, nothing problematic happened.  Bitcoin requires global consensus, so you cannot work on sub-partitions of the network.<p>> So 51% attacks [...] can&#x27;t violate consensus rules<p>I should probably reword that part.",1428964301

Specifically you can have wrong assumption about the numbers that are to be generated by the given algorithms. Let me explain you on the smaller example: let&#x27;s generate the floats instead of doubles. If all possible input integer values were generated by Matsumoto&#x27;s algorithm i e [0..8388607] and then from them generated the floats Xi in the range [0..1) then multiplying Xi with the constant 8388608f should get the results: 0f, 1f, 2f, ... 8388605f, 8388606f, 8388607f. And that&#x27;s what is produced. Doubles have more bits but function the same: the constant which makes the tests easy is 4503599627370496.0 and the last number from the algorithm after the multiplication with that constant should be 4503599627370495, and the previous 4503599627370494 etc. The first three should of course be 0, 1 and 2.<p>What does your &quot;better&quot; algorithm produce under the given assumptions? Or do you actually have some other assumptions? If you do, it doesn&#x27;t mean their algorithms are wrong, these do what they are designed to do and obviously correctly.<p>I suggest you you test your algorithm on floats, using absolutely all inputs and calculating all the outputs. Then you can write here what you achieved, that is, if you started from other goals, did you really reach them for all the inputs? Note that you don&#x27;t need any random number generator to prove you reached your goal, just show that for given input of all ascending integers you get the desired output -- every result should also appear only once (I see your &quot;tests&quot; on github aren&#x27;t made so).<p>But please don&#x27;t write about C++ or use some notation from the latest C++ standards.

The only reason you can sail upwind in a sailboat on the water is because you have a keel pushing against the water to prevent you from blowing downwind. Essentially, a sailboat sits on the interface between two fluids (air and water) that are moving relative to each other, and abuses that fact to go wherever it wants to. If you couldn&#x27;t push against the water, or in the extremely unlikely case that the water and wind had identical velocities, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to sail upwind.

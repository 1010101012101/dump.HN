Decide on your own if you will support them. And then do it with your whole heart. Don't sit there and tell us you ""have"" to because it's ""expected.""<p>Don't stay in college just because you don't know what you'd do otherwise -- figure it out! Make a plan! And then leave. Leave before you end up more miserable, with falling grades, and are kicked out... or you graduate, with a degree having strangled every ounce of passion out of you, and end up in a job that is just as bad.<p>Nobody is going to intervene and fix this for you. The pain you are feeling is because you are living somebody else's life for them. You have to find & choose to live your OWN life.<p>That may end up including college. You may decide, after weighing how you feel, that you should support your family, too. Choosing to do what you consider to be the right thing can feel wonderful. But not if you're only doing it because you don't want to feel guilty.<p>So, that, and pick up a copy of of When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron. If possible, the audio book. Listen to it and do what it says. I promise you, it'll help.",1288260554

But theano will probably never be considered a default dependency for common machine learning libs as long as there is no good OpenCL runtime opensource and pre-packaged in major posix distros (linux and bsd, osx already has opencl by default but not opensource hence cannot be reused in linux AFAIK).",1288260554

And Oracle is suing Google over that very same thing.<p>Oracle claims that they own the copyright on Java API, including clean-room reimplementations of the Java API.  It's a novel legal theory that didn't work for IBM or AT&T so we'll have to wait and see what happens.<p>Oracle also has patents that pretty much prohibit anyone from writing any kind of JIT VM.  That's just one more pathology of a system that allows software patents at all.  It's literally illegal today to write any kind of software in the USA because of the breathtaking quantity of basic techniques patented long after their first use by our broken patent office.  Oracle is just the one seeking to enforce that prohibition today.",1288260210

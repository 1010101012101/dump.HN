I always feel as though I'm losing so much screen real estate to it. (This is also the reason why I stopped using iGoogle as my homepage) Does anyone have any links to usability research that shows that having menus on the side vs the top is better? It looks like a few people are going this way in their designs, and I am wondering if it is just to make their product look different and new, or if there is actually sound logic behind the changes.",1259053142

- i once read someone say most people don't look good enough on camera to make video comments!
- often commenting sections of blogs become arguements, if someone can see you, it potentially gives them more ammunition to diss you personally (e.g you're fat, short, dumb looking etc)",1259052491

958931,comment,958563,958563,0,0,sunkencity,,,"I think there's a need for a high end cross platform toolkit/framework for developing web apps that provide some high-end stuff for iphone and android but also can degrade gracefully for ""phone"" phones that have crappier browsers. Ideally this would work like unobtrusive javascript, instead of having to have two views.<p>I'm currently investigating building a better mobile web presence for an application. The solution for us so far has been to mangle WURFL to a faster format and use that to detect properties of the current device from the UserAgent (width/height mainly). The WURFL way is to do a lehvenstein calculation on the current user agent versus all the agents in the db, pretty expensive computation.<p>This puts the crappiest phones first, because the web we build is very restricted by the poor phones, but the truth is that iPhone/Android is rapidly approaching 50%, because they are more likely to actually use the mobile internet.<p>To build this could quite possibly be a javascript layer on top of a basic REST structure.",1259052111

compared to Canada you'll find that housing is quite a bit smaller than you're used to. Especially if you want to live in or near the centre of any larger city. However, I would encourage you to compromise on space when searching for housing, rather than searching a large house in an unfortunate location. The city centres are a so much nicer place to live than the outskirts (in my opinion any way). Finally, cars are very expensive here, and trafic (especially rushhour trafic) is terrible. Being able to use public transport or a bicycle to get to work is a big (BIG!) plus, so try to look out for that when looking for work and a place to live.",1259051519

You are going to be taking BART and CalTrain a lot, since Berkeley has little in the way of venture capital and not a huge hacker community outside of the university.  If you were willing to compromise on your principles somewhat then a zipcar membership and a place in Mountain View would probably serve your long-term goals a lot better.  Caltrain is close, you are at the confluence of highways 101, 280, & 85 and you are sitting in the metaphorical heart of silicon valley.  The weekly farmers market is year-round, you can bike to whole foods and some nice asian groceries, castro street has nice coffeeshops and a bit of a nightlife, you could probably walk to the hacker dojo, and an occasional car trip will get you everything else you need.

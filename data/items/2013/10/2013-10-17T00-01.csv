In practice here at Bislr, we find that about 70 percent of the things we want to test are ultimately not going to make a big difference to the business.&quot;<p>I stopped reading after I read this. What an outrageous statement. If 70% of the things you want to test will not make a big difference, what about the other 30%? Test them!

6563059,comment,6562868,6562868,1,0,schallis,,,"The article raises some Interesting points, even if all conflated under the banner of &#x27;everyone should code&#x27; being wrong.<p>&quot;Not everyone enjoys coding&quot;
Sure, in which case there&#x27;s no point doing something you don&#x27;t like. I do think however that everyone should be encouraged to give it a go and the barrier to entry should be low. Indeed it is getting lower with sites like codeacademy.org. My personal opinion is that basic coding (like that currently taught in UK universities) should be a mandatory class in high school alongside mathematics since the exposure and insight into the fundamental technology of the day is immensely useful.<p>&quot;Not everyone is good at coding&quot;
Absolutely, the reference to academic programming and &#x27;scripting&#x27; is absolutely true and as pointed out does not mean that the code solves problems inadequately. In fact I&#x27;ve experienced smart programmers go through this and completely miss the point that that they are hired to solve problems. Programmers can become obsessed with the style and cleanliness of their code  at the end of the day, the real aims should be maintainability and correctness, which are similar but not entirely the same.<p>&quot;Code can&#x27;t solve every problem&quot;
True story. Just like philosophy or mathematics, it&#x27;s a tool in a box. There are always going to be crazies who take things to extremes, and let&#x27;s face it, many programmers are somewhere on the spectrum and tend to have an idealistic outlook on life.",1381971516

The modern nation-state is founded on the premise that the state has a monopoly on physical force; it is hard for a corporation to cause misery and death without that.<p>I would be more scared about cozy relationships between government and corporations.  That is when you get the most egregious offenses, eg. British East India Company + Great Britain vs. India and China, oil companies + US vs. the Middle East, Chinese government + Baidu in censoring their own people, Blackwater Associates + US in Iraq, etc.  It is sometimes good to have the interests of corporations and government diametrically opposed, because that means they are not conspiring against the people they serve.",1381971453

6563047,comment,6560085,6560890,1,0,marcus_holmes,,,"I was taught Latin, badly, at a British boarding school for, but never mastered it and was &#x27;demoted&#x27; to the woodworking class after a year. I also spent my free time in the computer room learning to program on a Commodore Pet (I still remember the number 32768 primarily because it&#x27;s the start of the video memory page; vital if you&#x27;re going to poke ascii values into the display page).
In later life I was made to feel ignorant by my inability with Latin, and my ability to speak C,C++,Pascal, Basic and Assembler was largely ignored or derided, even when needed.
I&#x27;ve always found my knowledge of woodworking and programming massively more useful (and therefore valuable) than a decent grasp of a dead language, but my more &#x27;cultured&#x27; friends disagreed and condescended.
Now, however, I&#x27;m beginning to perceive a level of discomfort amongst my more &#x27;cultured&#x27; friends, that while an understanding of Latin is absolutely required for an intellectual life, an understanding of javascript might be needed to.

6562968,comment,6562211,6562612,6,0,bane,,,"The figures provided in WP are for a 1961 Encyclopaedia Britannica (EB). Modern studies of contemporary primitive people groups shows markedly different life expectancy figures and reasoning. For example the neolithic life expectancy drop is now not considered to have been as severe attributed to communicable diseases introduced by domesticating livestock not grain introduction -- I&#x27;d add that our sample size of Neolithic dead people is also pitifully small.<p>Another easy to research example, we know from historic records that life expectancy in 19th century Ireland was near the top of the table you provided in WP, but was considered quite low for the time period in Western Europe. Other data shows that by 1900 U.S. life expectancy was already ~50 which is almost double the figure provided by EB.<p>Another way to think about it is, unless humans rapidly developed an ability to handle grains in the last couple hundred years, life expectancy should still be at or around historic numbers, not at around double. People should still be dropping dead from diets of grains, but they don&#x27;t. So an external causal agent <i>other</i> than grains (livestock domestication, introduction of alcohol, large scale warfare, highly virulent diseases) must be the logical conclusion.<p>The figures are off for Classical Rome as well. Depending on your social class life expectancy was around 40 for the lower classes and around 60 for the upper classes. Other studies show that if a child made it through their first 5 years, they could be expected to live to around 50 regardless of social class. It wasn&#x27;t considered unusual to see people in their 60s and even early 70s even if the percentage of population in those ages was much smaller than today. But of course documentation isn&#x27;t very good either leading to those conflicting figures.<p>Another case, Australia spent about 30 years trying to get the life expectancy of Aboriginals up to any kind of reasonable number. I believe the gap when they started studying it was about 20 years. Grains were not causing non-Aboriginals to drop dead before their Aboriginal hunter gatherer neighbors.<p>I&#x27;m generally suspicious of any expectancy tables for any population that don&#x27;t start at around 35-40 for any time period. Numbers lower than that are almost always the cause of a catastrophic external factor like the Black Death. There are pitifully few well documented populations where life expectancy isn&#x27;t at least in the 40s. This goes for hunter gatherer tribes to the most war-torn inhospitable genocide suffering places on the planet with access to virtually no healthcare and unbelievable infant mortality rates but plenty of grains.<p>The introduction of a staple bearing diet had little effect on life expectancy numbers directly, but enabled other advances which did.",1381969859

One of the most efficient $/hashrate GPUs for litecoin mining is the ATI 7950 at about $210 a piece and ~600 KH/s. 105 * 600 KH/s = ~60000 KH/s = ~$114, so it works out. That&#x27;s $20,000. So if you spend $20,000 you can buy yourself a job that pays $114 a day. It will take 6 months just to break even. Better hope the difficulty hasn&#x27;t increased enough in that time to make your GPUs irrelevant (hint: it probably will).<p>Keep in mind that I was very generously excluding the very significant cost of power, the very significant cost of all the motherboards/cpu/ram/power supplies to run those GPUs, and the power and space required to cool them. Realistically we&#x27;re looking at more like $50k.<p>>Currently Im making about 60 litecoin per day, he said. Ive kept 95% of the mining profit since April and once the major exchanges start accepting LTC, others will follow, and price is expected to soar. So that 60 LTC could turn into $1,500.<p>This is absurd. If he thinks 60 LTC will be worth $1,500, he should spend the $20,000 he spent on GPUs on LTC instead. He&#x27;d turn $20,000 into $250,000 with no work required (another hint: assuming you can turn $20k into $250k in 6 months with no work as a sure thing is also absurd).",1381969392

6562926,comment,6562080,6562080,3,0,SaberTail,,,"It&#x27;s a stretch to call this an attempt to explain matter-antimatter asymmetry.<p>First, let&#x27;s start with how fermions (spin 1/2 particles like electrons and quarks) get mass. They get it through a coupling with the Higgs boson, and the strength of that coupling determines the particle&#x27;s mass. Neutrinos are fermions, so they could get their mass in the same way. However, that would require a coupling to the Higgs much, much, much smaller than any other fermion has, and so it&#x27;s a bit of an unsatisfying solution.<p>However, neutrinos could be their own particles (Majorana particles), as the article mentions. If that&#x27;s the case, they can acquire mass in a different way than all other fermions. Some of the mechanisms (called see-saw mechanisms) that lead to small neutrino masses predict the existence of heavy neutrinos (so heavy that we haven&#x27;t observed them).<p>Now, a heavy neutrino would decay to the lighter particles we see today. So there aren&#x27;t any around anymore. But in the early universe, shortly after the big bang, there was enough energy to create them.<p>Particles can preferentially decay to matter instead of antimatter. It&#x27;s called CP violation, and we observe it in things like heavy mesons. So if the heavy neutrino violates CP when it decays, then that could lead to our universe being made of matter.<p>But I&#x27;ve strung together a lot of hypotheticals:
1. Neutrinos must be Majorana particles.
2. Majorana neutrinos acquire mass through a see-saw mechanism with heavy neutrinos.
3. Heavy neutrinos violate CP when they decay.<p>This experiment might answer #1.<p>Number 2 would probably require studying cosmology. The mass of the heavy neutrinos is probably greater than we could create in a collider on earth (like grand unified theory scale).<p>For number 3, it can be argued that if we observe CP violation in light neutrinos (in this case, CP violation would mean neutrinos oscillate differently than antineutrinos), then heavy neutrinos should exhibit it, too. But we&#x27;re still trying to look for CP violation in light neutrinos. And it&#x27;s not clear that CP violation in light neutrinos must imply that heavy neutrinos do it, too.<p>I agree that finding out the nature of the neutrino is important and really cool, but I&#x27;ve always thought trying to argue that double-beta decay experiments are going to solve the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem is hyping things a bit too much. Isn&#x27;t potentially measuring the mass of neutrinos cool enough?",1381969353

Smart Wheel uses GPS data to learn about your cycling habits and routines and then suggests on how to improve them. This data can also be used to help improving the cycling experiences of other people. Copenhagen Wheel measures noise and air pollution levels and uses them for statistical purposes only.<p>3) Smart Wheel is opensource which means our users will be available to develop their own apps and other tools to find new innovations to using the Smart Wheel. We&#x27;re already working closely with Pebble Watch and other similar devices are in the works, too.<p>4) Last but not least, despite being around for ~5 years, Copenhagen Wheel is still only a prototype with no sign of ever being available to the market.

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.<p>The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.<p>Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.<p>Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.<p>Probably wasn&#x27;t the same fucking elephant.&quot;",1381969014

Marshall McCusick was describing how he, Bill Joy and others were at Berkeley and literally implementing the Internet in BSD!  They were funded by DARPA and were overseen by DARPA admnistrators.  But they actually were not doing all of it -- DARPA was also paying private contractors for other components. (Which ended up in some technical disagreements as I recall.)<p>That BSD code is of course not only the foundation of the Internet, but of your iPhones and iPads as well.  Actually I believe it is fundamental to Windows as well, since my understanding is that the TCP/IP implementation in Windows is BSD code.<p>Silicon Valley doesn&#x27;t have the foresight for the technical foundations of society (and I say that having worked here for over a decade).  The web wasn&#x27;t invented by Silicon Valley either.  Neither was e-mail.  Neither was Perl, PHP, Python, or Ruby.  Python was actually government funded too.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget that Bill Clinton and the government made all your location-based apps possible, by opening GPS satellites to the public in the 90s.",1381968600

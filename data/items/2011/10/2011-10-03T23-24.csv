3068752,story,,,7,6,dasht,"Wanna start-up in Berkeley, CA?",,"I think I would like to convince the Berkeley, CA city council to make some zoning changes to attract YC-style start-ups.   Maybe Berkeley could even aspire to be the location of a YC start-up school.<p>I need some help establishing whether there is realistic demand that would move into town if these zoning changes were made.<p>Downtown Berkeley has many vacant retail fronts, as do other retail corridors in Berkeley.  These stores are hard to rent because they are ""deep"".  They are narrow but go back from the storefront very far.   They are like this because, back in the day, you'd store inventory in the back and have a storefront up front.   Few need such spaces anymore, so the retail space is too expensive for retail.<p>I am proposing that tenants should be allowed a dual use:  offices (such as hackerspaces suitable for a start-up) in the back -- and subleasing to artists, artisans, and other cultural uses up-front -- with no or limited partitioning between the two spaces.  (Think, 3.5-walled start-ups opened up to cultural spaces on the main street of a vibrant university town.)<p>Is there demand for such start-up space in Berkeley?   How can I be sure?  How can I persuade council, if indeed there is such demand?",1317686365

""Leak"" implies that some employee let the information out against the express wishes of their boss... but this is not what has happened here.<p>I'm familiar with the culture and organizational structure of Amazon.  Only a very small number of people in Amazon would have access to this information, and none of those people would be where they are if they were the kind of person who ""leaked"" information.<p>This is a plant.<p>It is a plant based on the first 5 days of sales of a new product.<p>A new product that had weeks and weeks of ""leaks"" including someone putting an actual tablet in MG Sieglers hands.  (Tell me it wasn't a PR rep or executive in the company that did that...)<p>So, Amazon hyped up their new kindle for several weeks, then announced it, and got a bump in sales of the new device right after the announcement.<p>I wonder how many fewer than average kindles they sold in the weeks prior to that?<p>Then, cult of mac, a blog who regularly plays fast and loose with the facts, compares those 5 days of sales-- after weeks of hype and right after the announcement-- to the average rate of sales of the iPad, over a much longer period, and concludes that the Kindle is ""on track"" to outsell the iPad.<p>Talk about picking only favorable data to fit your conclusion!<p>Also, shouldn't a device that costs half as much (and does far less, naturally) outsell a more expensive device?  Shouldn't you expect a toyota to outsell a BMW, no matter how much extra value the BMW adds?   Would you even say the BMW and the toyota are in comparable categories?",1317686255

3068738,comment,3067438,3068599,2,0,jsz0,,,"Disagree.<p>There's no 3G/3GS on Verizon and exactly zero iPhone 4 Verizon customers are eligible for a subsidized upgrade yet. So it only affects the tiny number of customers who are going to pay $600 for an out-of-contract upgrade. The vast majority of Verizon iPhone owners would have to wait for their subsidized upgrade date which for most is March/April 2012 at the earliest.<p>For AT&T customers things are a bit more tricky. Any iPhone 4 owners are in the same boat as Verizon customers. Most won't have a subsidized upgrade available until late December. (if you have a more expensive plan with AT&T your upgrade date is earlier) This also goes for people who bought the 3GS in the last 14 months. The people who opted for the 3G in the last ~20 months decided to buy a low end model. For them the iPhone 4 or 4S would be the natural upgrade path and a massive upgrade.<p>No doubt there are some risks but I doubt Sprint would have a very long exclusivity period so even if Apple takes a beating for a month or two it will be of little consequence compared to $20B in the bank.",1317686113

However, it cost... somewhere in the neighborhood of $10,000. I'm not entirely sure, we have a five year lease on the thing, and it costs something like $500/month to run. It's an okay printer, as long as you run Windows.<p>There is a postscript module for the printer, but it costs around $1000, so Mac/Linux machines are out of luck, and our vendor hasn't actually said when we can get such a postscript module installed.

3068727,comment,3067740,3068508,3,0,zackmorris,,,"Oh sorry, basically treating code as any other media file.  ""Game Scripting Mastery"" by Varanese and LaMothe goes into a lot of detail about creating your own language and compiling it to I-code and then running the scripts in the game, the same way you would load images or sounds.  My partner writes very expressive code with creative macros (he independently discovered iterators by defining a macro like SPRITE to mean sprite[count]).  That might seem a little strange to a computer scientist, but look at what he did.  He didn't have to explain how references or lists or anything else worked.  If you understand arrays and #defines, then you can use iterators too.  And he does things like that to me all of the time, writing one liners to replace my pages of ""proper"" code.  The only problem is that he does it in c++ instead of javascript/python/lua so our games are in this constantly evolving state, so my top priority is adding a scripting library to our engine.  Then again, that introduces the need to bind all of these functions and data.  It will probably be a win though because we tend to work on large games.",1317685868

Since apparently you don't like my list.<p><i>Come off of it.</i><p>Don't be a jerk, jerk.  And I don't read Mongol blogs.<p>Edit: Thanks for the apology.  I also apologize for escalating.  I actually think your Jordan analogy is quite good.  But I think also spells out the difference, at least in my eyes.<p>I also view Jordan as the greatest of all-time.  With that said, I didn't gloat when he did well.  I was in awe of him, but I wasn't a cheerleader.  I'd vote for him as MVP, but I wouldn't cherish Karl Malone never winning it.  I wouldn't call Malone a lesser player in order to prop Jordan up as a better player.  I wouldn't downplay what Magic or Bird did to recognize that Jordan was still the greatest.<p>I feel like these three would cheer about Karl Malone getting injured a knee or Magic catching HIV if it meant that it would strengthen Jordan's position as best ever.<p>This is probably most obvious in the tablet space.  You'll see some bloggers noting that the iPad dominates.  No question about that, but you'll begin to see a split between those who are looking forward to what Android and Windows have in store for the future, versus those who are just outright dismissive that there is or ever will be anything to compete against the iPad.  And in fact downplay anything that might actually be even slightly competitive, ala the Kindle Fire.<p>I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing that they exist.

I am hardly very well informed on the processor market, so for all I know they do, though I'd be surprised.<p>2. Sure, I guess what I'm getting at is that we've done amazing things with what we've got, I'm by no means suggesting we shouldn't take a broader view and replace crap, or at least work towards it where market entrenchment makes things difficult. The point is, again, that if there exists such a plausible alternative to the Von Neumann architecture, then why aren't there machines out there taking advantage? Again you could probably fill a niche this way. I suppose, in answer to my own question here, that you would be fighting a losing battle against the rest of the hardware out there being reliant on V-N but still, I'd have assumed that <i>something</i> would exist :)<p>3. Yeah. But it's hard + often the harder path to do things <i>right</i> in any industry. Such is life, not that that excuses anything.<p>4. A sort of philosophical point. Feel free to ignore :-).<p>5. There is stuff out there that already exists too though. Go, OCaml, Haskell, F# are all really interesting languages which in their own ways tackle a lot of the accidental complexity problems out there. Plan 9 + inferno are very interesting OSes, though they are probably a little too niche to be all that useful in the real world. But yeah, understandable, fighting the tide is difficult.<p>6.

2) I don't agree, I believe the compuation is straightforward, my belief is that what you perceive as 'progress' is mostly just 'go really really fast.' I showed a Microsoft engineer at the Vintage computer festival installing an RDBMS on VMS while four people were playing games and exploring VMS on four terminals connected to the machine, then I fired up and ran the test code to show the code had installed and was usable. It did not impress him that I didn't reboot the system once, nor did the other four people using the system notice I had installed a new capability that was available to everyone using the OS. Those are not design goals of a 'personal' OS like Windos/DOS/NT, although they could be. The stuff you learn in CS classes about architecture and layers and models and invariants, can make for very robust systems.<p>3. My experience is that programmers program. Which is to say that they feel more productive when they produce 10,000 lines of code than when they delete 500 lines of code and re-organize another 500 lines. Unlike more 'physical goods' types of industries it is easier to push that stuff out into production. So more of it ends up in production.<p>4. Not sure where this was going.<p>5. This is something I like to believe in too, its just code, so write new code. Hey Linus did it right? The challenge is that it will take 4 - 5 years for one person to get to the point where they can do 'useful' stuff. That is a lonely time. I wrote the moral equivalent of ChromeOS (although using eCos as the underlying task scheduler and some of the original Java VM as the UI implementation.) Fun to write but not something picked up by anyone. You get tired.<p>6. I'd take a look at eCos here, one of the cool things about that project was a tool (ecosconfig) which helped keep leaks from developing.<p>In the 'hard' world (say Civil Engineering) there are liability laws that provide a corrective force. In software it is so easy to just get something put togehter that kinda works, that unless you are more interested in the writing than the result, you may find that you're spending less time on structure and more on results.",1317682830

Also from several projects that I converted from capistrano to vlad it runs much much faster for the standard deployment process. I'm not sure what is the reason as I didn't investigate it much.<p>we have custom vlad plugins for usual rails related stuff, so our config/deploy.rb scripts are usually about 5-10 lines long. see <a href=""https://github.com/astrails/vladify"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/astrails/vladify</a>",1317682815

1415512,comment,1415283,1415406,0,0,mdisraeli,,,"Wikipedia does not even aim to be the best encyclopedia, just an encyclopedia.<p>I've not read the actual article, as it seems that the host can't cope with the traffic, but if it was speedily deleted, it probably deserved it - most speedy deletions are genuine and helpful. However, as an experienced wikipedia editor, I have to say that you are wrong.<p>A few years ago, I built up over 500 mainspace edits and received numerous barnstars. I worked to correct minor errors, source references for articles, rewrite articles to flow better, and even to reduce tensions amongst editors and promote the editing of wikipedia by experts. But in the end, the corrosive and bitter nature of the community drove me away, much as it drives away a lot of people who are both knowledgable in their field and able to write about it.<p>""People seem to have a really hard time with the idea that Wikipedia imposes restrictions in order to make the lives of editors and maintainers easier.""<p>This idea is trivial to disprove. Firstly, the majority of articles do not need constant attention, and the number of articles is not directly proportional to the level of vandalism. The majority of editors focus on a few articles, and certain high-interest topics get the most attention. Very few editors actually go and work on random articles, so stating that there is any sort of diversion of energy by the presense of minority interest articles is false. If anything, removing minority interest kicks away the editors that supported those articles, editors who might otherwise have contributed to vandalism patrolling and other more widely helpful activities. Article-creep is an entirely imagined threat that simply does not exist.<p>In fact, a lot of articles nominated for deletion for not being notable have been fairly stable, unvandalised, verifiable, and even maintaned by their creators and related community. No one had an issue with the presense of these articles beyond not being notable enough - as if a purely electronic encyclopedia had some pressing page limit about to be reached.<p>You mention secondary sources, yet wikipedia editors as a whole can't understand how to use primary, secondary and tirtary sources correctly. It is a widely held (and enforced) belief that, when wanting to state that something was said in a book, only a secondary source can be cited. So they would prefer a newspaper's review to the actual book itself, for example. This is, for most cases, simply absurd.<p>Let's consider the deletion process. Officially, Articles For Deletion is about concensus. In practice, it's typically just a vote by the in-croud, most of which never explain their opinion beyond a brief comment. It doesn't matter how much you source an article during this process - it will normally get culled anyhow if they have taken a dislike. Indeed, there is a distinct dislike of trying to improve articles - instead you should just nominate them for deletion (never mind the fact that a quick google search can often give useful references to shore up an article)!<p>I could go on, but I'd be here all night.",1276037873

The cutoff for where your 1080 40"" TV might as well be a 720 TV is 7 to 8 feet; further away than that and you can't tell the difference between 1080 and 720. At about 12 feet you've lost HD entirely. Many people have setups that fail these criteria. And this is a continuum, not a sharp cutoff, so if you're on the far side you may be able to tell a difference but not think it's worth it.<p>Now, all that said, well-upsampled DVDs are much closer to BluRay than people selling BluRay would like to admit.

There are specific cable cutters (usually used in construction) work that can cut through the cable a lot easier though.<p>Unfortunately, the weakest part of the locks is either the lock itself, or the slot on the laptop. My friend recently had his MBP stolen when someone just ripped out the lock from the slot (so theres presumably a huge gash in the side of it now). We're still trying to figure out how it happened, but we're pretty sure it was something like those hydraulic jaws inserted between the lock and the body of the laptop.<p>Really, the ideal behind the lock is to deter theft by people who want to resale the laptop after. Anyhow who is willing to use a damaged laptop, or has customers who don't care where the laptop comes from can just continue to steal stuff more or less nilly willy.",1276037776

1415486,comment,1412062,1415036,0,0,sesqu,,,"For clarification: LCD displays like mine have red, green and blue tinted light sources, arranged such that one of each combine to roughly a square. Other displays work similarly, except they don't have any squares. I consider each light source a dot, and when viewing images at 1 pixel per square (natural device resolution), I consider the square a pixel for convenience. So inches are what I measure the size of my display in, natural pixels per inch are what I measure the resolution of <i>my</i> display in, and dots per inch are what I would measure the resolution an arbitrary display device in, if it did not have a natural mapping between pixels and dots.<p>So dpi is equivalent to 3<i>ppi for LCD under my definition, and both 1</i>ppi and 3*ppi dpi counts have been sighted in the wild. Using my definition is like using SI mibibytes; when you see dpi you don't know which is being measured, but when you see ppi you can be sure, since ppi is only used by people like me.<p>As such, I do not consider dots and pixels interchangeable; pixels are what I'm trying to represent, dots are what I'm representing them with. If I'm dealing with a printer, I acknowledge that I'm not going to get neat square pixels no matter how hard I try; instead, I'll end up with round, scattered dots. So I look at the dpi of the printer and the ppi of the ideal representation of my image (in inches), and get something like 6 dots/pixel. I consider this sufficient to render a close approximation to a tiny square, and proceed (actually, I don't usually look at that number, since printer resolution is never a problem for me).<p>This lets me focus on the one aspect of printing that actually matters to a computer: megapixels. As long as I keep the ppi ratio of my layout high, and trust that the printer has high dpi and proper scaling, I get to ignore stupidities like jpeg dpi metadata. In theory, anyway - occasionally print houses request specific dpi, which can be considered a ppi hint and used to do rescaling with the algorithm I want.<p>Disclaimer: I've never done any print or layout work.",1276037320

My GPA was well over 4.0, I was taking 5 AP courses, I'd just scored a 35 on my ACT and a 2240/1500 on the SAT. I was the founder of a robotics club and officer in several more. I was hardly nerdy. Perhaps geeky was a better word. My decent looks, charisma, and probably unwarranted confidence meant I got along with everyone, including the 'popular kids' and mentored a lot the younger 'not-so-popular' ones. Things were looking up. I applied to Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc. Competition is tough these days, so I honestly wasn't surprised to not be accepted. I went to the nearby big state University.<p>Perhaps because of the drudgery of this environment, or (more likely) because of the hatred of arbitrariness and general behavioral oddities that I share with many hacker-types, I did not thrive academically in this environment. In short, I fucked up and dropped out.<p>In the third grade, I was the one setting up the school's computers. Freshman year of high school, a friend introduced me to Linux. With the previously mentioned robotics club, I was introduced to programming (Java, bleh). Like many others, I got caught up in the big Ruby on Rails growth around 2005ish. My first year of college, I worked as a sysadmin under some very skilled, if old-school, folks. I spent last Summer traveling the world and thinking hard. Eventually I took another job as a Django web developer. I went to PyCon this year and it was heavenly.<p>I have an engineer's brain, but a romantic poet's heart. I'm not religious in any way. In fact, I'm a devout rationalist. As such, it's sometimes hard for me to find motivation in anything other than learning cool stuff and, more commonly, making other people happy. Even in development or entrepreneurship, my kick comes almost exclusively from sitting down next to a user and just seeing the glint in his or her eye as I ask ""If you could have this site/process/system/experience be any way you wanted it to be, what would you do?"". Most people are so used to annoying, convoluted user experiences and it honestly fucking kills me. Anyway, that's how I operate.<p>I want to move to the bay area. Partly because I have good friends from my worldwide trip there. Partly because my older, more successful, managerial-type sister is soon moving there to get into VC. Mostly because there's no hope of anything other than a dead-end corporate sysadmin job where I'm from. I want to build awesome things that help people in ways they didn't even know they could be helped. I want to dump all my time into something just so the occasional person says, ""Oh man, you built  blahblahblah. Dude. Thanks. Good job."" and then make it a thousand times better.<p>I'm young, debtless, and, unlike the rest of my family, I have no real interest in material things. All I want is a safe place to live, the ability to buy groceries to cook awesome food with, and the occasional cool gadget or book. Friends and knowledge provide me with more happiness than a shopping spree ever could.<p>So my question is: Are there any startups or hopeful founders that would like to kick ass together in SF? I will pour everything I have into building something awesome that makes the lives of others even slightly better. I love the idea living in the same place as my teammates, always bouncing ideas off of each other, learning new things, and creating something great. If you or your startup can provide me with a room/couch or a fair enough wage that I can sleep, eat, and slowly save up a bit to go back to school, these are the technical skills I can contribute:\n* Linux/Windows/Mac proficiency and administration\n* Familiarity with C++, Ruby, Python, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript (incl but not limited to jQuery)\n* Spent some time learning Actionscript (meh) and Objective-C (would like to do more with iOS if given opportunity)\n* Decent design eye and familiarity with Adobe CS\n* Most importantly, I know how to learn new things stupidly fast. I'm of at least average intelligence (see test scores above), and simply don't hit conceptual or mental barriers. I feel like this is pretty useful. If I'm not sufficiently good at something above now, I can be within a week or two.<p>I'm also great with nontechnical things. My writing skills shouldn't be lacking. My mother, a legal writing professor, made sure of that. Perhaps more than anything else, I'm good with people. I have a history in sales. I'm straightforward, honest, and a great listener (giving a damn about others helps). People respect me because I respect them. I take constructive criticism with enthusiasm, and dish it out with understanding and tact. Public speaking has never been a problem with me. I have a lot to say, and I know how to say it.<p>I think I can significantly help some young startup or group of people with high aspirations. I'm probably more qualified on paper to do technical things, but I'd like to help all over the place. I want to add features, talk to users, schmooz investors, and tell others how fucking awesome what I'm working on is, and I want to make sure it really is that excellent.<p>So. Does this sound appealing to anyone? Would anyone just like to tell me how crazy I am?<p>Go for it.",1276036501

But, once again, with feeling:<p>Wikipedia is <i>not</i> an effort to organize all the world's information. That's Google. Wikipedia is an effort to build the world's best encyclopedia. The difference between an ""encyclopedia"" and ""all the world's information"" is that the information in an encylopedia needs to be reliable. To ensure that the information in the encylopedia has a chance at being reliable, the encyclopedia is constrained to information that can be written about notable topics cover in reliable secondary sources.<p>Virtually everybody who writes an article about a nonnotable topic ends up objecting, often loudly, when the article is deleted. That's understandable. Wikipedia could do a better job of warning people of the bar their topic needs to clear. But they can't make resurrection of deleted articles trivial to anybody, or they will spend all their time re-litigating deletions.<p>This is not helped by the fact that WP articles gain extremely favorable search engine position almost by default.<p>People seem to have a really hard time with the idea that Wikipedia imposes restrictions in order to make the lives of editors and maintainers easier. But --- and I say this as a WP-skeptic --- the community effort that built WP is monumental and unprecedented. They get the benefit of the doubt.<p>Regardless, the likelihood that the particular ""speedy deletion"" policy this article complains about will ever be resolved is epsilon. Speedy deletion, particularly of no-name bands, vanity books, websites, and tiny companies is almost the first line of defense against article-creep. Changing the policy would be an existential change to the way WP is managed.<p>Which doesn't matter, because you can resurrect speedy'd articles already; you just need to take the article to Deletion Review and make a case for it. Maybe WP needs an article on First Aid Kit. I like Fleet Foxes, too! (WP has excellent coverage of Fleet Foxes). But WP is run by human beings donating their time, and people make mistakes, and it is utterly disingenuous to pretend like First Aid Kit is an obvious ""keep"".",1276034965

""really interacting with them"" is not their purpose.<p>You can open an Excel spreadsheet even if you haven't done so in your life and only have experience using Word ... you can move around, search for text, change styles, print. That's because it uses common interface elements that have been used for years.<p>Yes, Office 2010 brings interface changes, but it's nothing to worry about ... once you clicked the round button once, you'll learn its position. It took me a whole week to not trip over C-x C-s in Emacs, or to remember C-x C-c, and I had to setup my own shortcuts for common stuff (like C-w which deletes the previous word ... as in Vim, because even if my life depended on it, I couldn't learn the Emacs shortcut). And I still don't know how to print from Emacs.<p>We are talking about technically-inclined people here. Textmate is a lot more intuitive to use ... I'm still using Emacs because it is much more powerful, but boy what a painful experience it was the first months.",1276034786

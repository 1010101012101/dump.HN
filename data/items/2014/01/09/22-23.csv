If a calculator produced the wrong answer to a basic mathematical function we would throw it out.<p>Humans are error prone, even when doing things they know and are good at.<p>Artificial intelligence is marketed as being a machine that is as smart as a human, but somehow we infer that because AI is a machine it will not make human mistakes. Mistakes are what produces learning.<p>The question becomes, do we only release AI for public use when it is assigned to a narrow range of problems and trained to 99.9% accuracy? Or does a consumer just throw AI at unknown, or even non trainable, problems and we take the result with a grain of salt? (Non trainable being something like predicting the value of the S&P 500 in 24 months.)<p>Perhaps a new words will be formed to describe AI, its behavior, accuracy, and experience?

It takes their &quot;estimated&quot; income for the year (ideally a slightly low estimate) and then they record each invoice/payment. It tells them how much to set aside from each for income taxes at the end of the year considering their local tax rules. I&#x27;d kill for this if it was super simple to use and erred on the side of caution with amounts (I&#x27;d rather have too much set aside then too little). I&#x27;d like to actually implement this one myself if I ever get time.<p>2. Custom ready meals. Design and order customized microwavable/prepackaged meals and have them delivered to your door (logistics issue here). Great for all sorts of situations but mostly targeted at busy people who find themselves eating out too much, especially those with special diets. Could allow limitless variety.<p>3. An easier/cheaper way to post podcast episodes on a schedule. Try running a regular podcast and you&#x27;ll get some idea of how limited the options are.<p>4. I strongly suspect there&#x27;s room for yet another photo social app that is effectively snap chat (easily send photos to specific people) but where the photos stick around. Instagram has implemented this feature but it&#x27;s a bit buried under all the other options and I don&#x27;t think anyone uses it. Simplicity will rule this arena.<p>5.

7033811,comment,7029454,7029606,4,0,Joeri,,,"Speaking as someone who has written hundreds of thousands of lines of php over the years, i think php&#x27;s main problem is not that it lacks features, but rather that it doesn&#x27;t have a sane subset, a javascript-like &#x27;good parts&#x27; if you will. PHP added OO api&#x27;s for date and database handling in the 4 to 5 transition, but it never got around to doing the same for strings and arrays. So frameworkless php is by necessity a mixture of procedural and OO code (unless you go pure procedural), and always looks ugly. PHP&#x27;s stewards could solve this by bringing all the API&#x27;s into the OO fold, and I have experimented [0] with what PHP could look like if strings and arrays were objects, but so far this hasn&#x27;t happened.<p>You do have some really nice frameworks that hide the procedural stuff, like laravel, and that code looks nice, but it is really slow. And this is the inherent conflict of the php developer. If you write raw php, it is ugly but fast. If you use a framework it is pretty but slow. The techempower benchmarks [1] demonstrate this, where raw php performs at near-native speeds, but frameworks like symfony and laravel are embarassingly slow in comparison.<p>So, php&#x27;s scorn is well deserved. It&#x27;s productive, yes, but it is impossible to build a world-class top-performing app in it and still get clean and consistent code without jumping through some sizeable hoops (like facebook did by building their own php engine and php-like language called Hack, in addition to their own frameworks).<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/jsebrech/php-o"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jsebrech/php-o</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r8&hw=i7&test=query"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r8&hw=i7...</a>",1389307454

The customer is facing a build vs. buy decision.<p>The HIPAA Security Rule requires appropriate Administrative, Physical, and Technical Safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of protected health information (PHI). AWS, FireHost, and Rackspace are great! But, HIPAA compliant hosting providers like these only provide a HIPAA ready environment. They will sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA), but they only handle the Physical Safeguards mandated by HIPAA. If you use a HIPAA compliant hosting provider you still have to spend months developing a HIPAA compliant application stack within that environment.<p>In contrast, TrueVault provides all client-side and server-side functionalities required by HIPAA, and works just like any other API service. The typical TrueVault integration takes days and saves months of development time.<p>Plus, if you want AWS to sign a BAA you need to use dedicated instances and each instance hour is 10% more than the standard fee. So your meter starts at $1,500/month if you want to become HIPAA compliant with AWS. FireHost starts at $1,115/month and you are charged a $250 premium for each HIPAA ready instance.",1389306446

Going forward, there are three paths for the developers of these codebases to take:<p>1. They can stay with Python 2.x until the lack of updates becomes a problem.\n2. They can attempt to switch out Python 2.x code with Python 3.x code where appropriate.\n3. They can choose to rewrite with a language other than Python.<p>Of the three options, which is the least beneficial to the Python community? The third one. Which is the most beneficial? The second one. To enable this, it makes sense to enable easier mixing of Python 2 with Python 3. So the &#x27;one feature&#x27; I&#x27;d like to see in Python 2.8, if it is ever made, is to be able to interpret both Python 2.7 code and some set version of Python 3.<p>How would the interpreter know the difference?

Once I picked up the skill that other people hadn&#x27;t learnt, then I became &quot;the SKILL guy&quot;, which means that you get more work based on that skill, which lets you learn even more.<p>2) To learn things, I would set myself the goal of trying to do every task in one language.  And I mean every task, including tasks that it sucked at.  Whereas other people just took the pre-written tool/software and used it, I wanted to see if i could do it from scratch.  Its not the best way to do business, but its the best way to learn something inside and out.<p>3) Plain stubborn persistence and realizing there are no hard problems/theories/techniques, just ones you haven&#x27;t spent enough time studying and getting familiar with.  Its ok not to know or understand things.  What&#x27;s not ok is to run away from them because you don&#x27;t know or understand them.  There&#x27;s a lot of fragile egos in programming/academics/business where people try to insinuate that because they don&#x27;t understand something its &quot;not worth knowing/is useless&quot;, or that you are stupid for not understanding what they understand.  Forget all that and just keep bashing away at a topic, looking for different opinions and perspectives on how to pick it up, and when you understand something on your 8th go, you&#x27;re now on equal footing with the person who understood it on the 1st go (if there ever was such a person, and there often isn&#x27;t).<p>4) Always pushing my self into the things that I can&#x27;t do.  This is a bit weird, because most of our school systems condition one to do the things you score well at and avoiding the things you fail at.  Screw that.  You might get good grades and a job but you will never grow as a person that way.

MBTI presents a basis in a 4-dimensional subspace of that. How well it works for a particular person depends on how her personality aligns with that basis.<p>A lot people will test near the middle on the MBTI characteristics, and say that the test does not work for them. If most of the population is near the middle, statistical studies won&#x27;t show much validation for MBTI either.<p>Now, none of that means that the test has little value -- it actually has a lot of value, but only for people who test at relatively high scores. For example, I generally test as either ENTP or INTP -- and since I&#x27;m near the middle of E/I scale, it does not tell much either way. my N, T, and P, however, are quite extreme (I&#x27;ve done quite a few of these, and not once have I had a case when my N or T score was not at the end of the range, P nearly there too) -- so the descriptions and advice for these types that I&#x27;ve seen have been quite relevant and helpful.",1389305012

7033593,comment,7030778,7030778,1,0,russelluresti,,,"Thrun&#x27;s new objective - to give industry a voice in the education process, is a valid objective. Most of the research shows that what people learn in school only contributes in a minor way to what they do - they learn most of what they need to know on-the-job. Udacity&#x27;s new direction will allow companies to help potential prospects acquire those skills beforehand, in this general education-augmented way. It&#x27;s not a bad idea, and it&#x27;s definitely something that was needed.<p>However, it is sad to see one of the most vocal people toss aside the original goal of providing education to the under-priveleged to help them escape poverty. Just saying that poor people have a different set of challenges that make online classes a &quot;poor fit&quot; for them is the easy way out.<p>It&#x27;s also sad to hear him say that the true value proposition of education is employment. The notion that education and employment are hand-in-hand related is the thing that holds back the education system the most. Education is about allowing people to move forward - advancing culture, science, technology, etc. so that we&#x27;re not all stuck plowing fields with oxen. While capitalism ties these advancements to employment and profit, the connection is based entirely on how things are done now, and not how things could or should be done (or even how they were done in the past).",1389304873

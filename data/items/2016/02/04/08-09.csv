When I started out after dropping out of grad school I was working on search algorithms and a bunch of my coworkers had a background in informational retrieval and I did not, and I was kind of thinking about it in the wrong way. I was thinking about it like it was a math puzzle and if I just thought really hard it would all make sense.<p>So one day I was stumped in how to make this signal useful and Amit suggested, hey why don&#x27;t you take the square root. I was like, why a square root, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense, nothing is getting squared ever, and he went up to the whiteboard and just drew a square-root-ish-wiggle-arc-shape and said look you just want something that looks like this. Square root, log, whatever.<p>I was like, oh... am I allowed to write code that doesn&#x27;t make any sense? I thought I wasn&#x27;t supposed to do that. And he was just like, well, just don&#x27;t worry about it, you are overthinking it, you can take all the square roots you want, multiply by 2 if it helps, add 5, whatever, just make things work and we can make it make sense later.<p>At that point I realized that real world software engineering was much different than research had been, and also that this was going to be way more fun.",1454576316

When living in the city, one gets value in exchange for giving up the privacy of owning your own home and land. And, it is not realistic for people who are poor, or even middle class, to own a home in a major metropolis, and so they often do live in an apartment or townhome (a mini-house that shares walls with one or more other townhomes...somewhere between a condominium and a real house). I would accept that kind of lifestyle if living in a densely populated city. I wouldn&#x27;t if living in most mid-sized cities in the US...but, housing is still expensive. A tiny house on a plot of land fits the bill perfectly for me. I don&#x27;t need more living space than an apartment provides, I just need more space than having neighbors on the other side of the wall provides. I also want a garden.<p>Americans who grew up in rural areas have an even more extreme view of how much space is the right amount than I do (I grew up in the suburbs, and still hate apartments).<p>Also, I want to own where I live, by the time I get close to retirement age (which I&#x27;m still a few decades away from, but it&#x27;s part of the usual retirement plans for most Americans, and they start working on it during middle age).",1454574992

(Obligatory &quot;if you have a mortgage you&#x27;re just renting from the bank and have to fix the water heater yourself&quot; line here.)<p>Another is financial: There are heavy tax incentives towards ownership, though this is lessened in the era of cheap money.  (On the other hand, if a mortgage can be had for cheap, that puts upward pressure on house prices because fewer units of currency go towards borrowing costs.)<p>Still another is logistical: Most areas of the U.S. have very few renter protections.  If your landlord wants you out and you&#x27;re not under a current lease, you&#x27;re out (property rights of the owner and all).  This goes double for the desirable places to live.  For those who can manage it, the stability of &quot;my housing cost is a known quantity that varies only a little bit outside of my control&quot; (obligatory &quot;did you save for a new hot water heater?&quot; goes here) outweighs the relative immobility of property ownership.  Plus, a somewhat high price is put on the ability to paint one&#x27;s own walls, have a pet, and do minor renovations without asking for permission.  Witness the plethora of &quot;home remodeling&quot; shows and TV channels.  In many rental units, doing this is not just frowned upon, it is actively forbidden by the lease.<p>As always, to stave off the inevitable replies of &quot;but my rental experience has <i>never</i> been like that,&quot; your miles may vary.

I went in willing/able to put a 30-40% down payment on the property, with plans to build my own tiny house completely self-funded over the next year or so. The banks were simply not at all equipped to address that. Despite my excellent credit (high 700s) and low debt, and the cash to make the down payment and good income, they made it clear that I would be able to get a loan on a regular sized house with much less money down, but would not be able to get a loan on just a piece of land with plans to put a tiny house on it.<p>They were also willing to talk about loaning money for the land, <i>if</i> I could show how I was going to afford to build a &quot;regular&quot; house on the property (requiring going through a builder and getting a loan on the future house). In short, the was no way, short of paying for the property entirely out of pocket I would be able to buy land and build my own tiny house on it.<p>It was incredibly frustrating. I mean, I&#x27;m talking to these folks and they are, with a straight face, saying, &quot;Well, as a first time home buyer, you could put 5%-15% down and buy a house, with the bank loaning you the other ~$160,000.&quot; And, I&#x27;d say, &quot;OK, but what if I put $25,000 down, and only borrow $50,000 from the bank, and buy a piece of land, and over the next year I build myself a house on that land.&quot; And, they&#x27;d reply, &quot;That&#x27;s just not gonna happen.&quot;<p>So, several banks would have been happy to loan me $160k with $16k down on a full-sized house, but no one was willing to loan me $50k with $25k down on land for a tiny house.<p>I gave up on buying at that time. Will save up and pay cash for a plot of land in another year or two, and build my tiny house then.<p>I doubt it will change any time soon. Home builders have no motivation to build smaller, banks have no interest in betting on self-built homes. Which is understandable to some degree...but, the sheer hardheadedness of the response was really surprising, to me. I&#x27;d always assumed I would have no trouble getting whatever kind of loan I wanted, as long as I brought enough cash to the table. But, for land-only deals, many banks want to see 50% or more down payment, which is silly.<p>So, tiny houses remain mostly the privilege of those wealthy enough to afford to buy land without a mortgage, or those who don&#x27;t mind living in places where land is very, very cheap. It&#x27;s also possible to park a tiny house in a trailer park or RV park (and I know some folks who do that), but that misses the point of home ownership, for me.",1454574552

This might explain the first point as well.<p>I only need to look at my friends and extended social circle(s) to see how relatively little their frequent use of psychedelics had on them. The ones where it seemed to have most effect were people who treated it as a more meaningful (and/or spiritual) experience, and especially those who changed aspects of their daily life through this.<p>Whenever someone brings up Steve Jobs, for example, and his mention of LSD as life-changing, my immediate thought is: &#x27;yeah, but he also lived in an stark, empty house, was spiritually &#x27;active&#x27; (don&#x27;t remember what exactly, some buddhist movement), and went as far as changing his diet and <i>not</i> going to a doctor when he should have. Clearly it wasn&#x27;t just the LSD, but an entire way of living to go along with that.<p>I&#x27;m afraid that if the use of psychedelics becomes a cultural norm, we&#x27;ll just give it a small place in our lives where it can do little harm and is defanged of it&#x27;s power.

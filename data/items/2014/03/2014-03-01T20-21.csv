Tuition costs and textbook costs have skyrocketed (see <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/23/charts-just-how-fast-has-college-tuition-grown"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/10/23/charts-just-h...</a> ) while faculty salaries have stagnated or even gone down in real terms ( <a href=""http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/C2BAFA70-057E-4097-908B-6E4A6B5A6D38/0/TABB.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/C2BAFA70-057E-4097-908B-6E4...</a> )<p>Empire-building is correct though in the sense that public institutions are the ones raising their tuition costs by so  much (78%!), and a big reason for this is do to college&#x27;s building new infrastructure, which often times they have no need for. Take SF State University who I used to work for, they built a brand new gymnasium and a brand-new library at a cost of over a billion dollars for a student population in which 78% are commuter students who hold down part-time jobs and spend no time on campus. It just doesn&#x27;t make financial sense. That said, faculty costs are still the primary problem and why community colleges get the taxpayer a much better bang for the buck.

[1] The rough isomorphism between HTML and Lisp S-expressions [2] was an obvious technical advantage over JavaScript and among the Lisps, though tellingly not the case with Scheme, the association list was already in place to do all the work that JSON has come to perform in exactly the same way but for syntax.<p>AOL of course destroyed Netscape after purchasing it by encumbering itself and all it touched with an East Coast Big Dumb Company mindset. It wasn&#x27;t until years later when Google started seeing Microsoft as the competition that anyone else treated the browser strategically. By that time, JavaScript had won just by showing up in IE 6 and in the legacy Mozilla carried from Netscape.<p>What might have happened if Yahoo had decided the browser was strategic instead of living off banner ad revenue at the expense of increasing irrelevance? They had Graham and the Viaweb team, and so some manager decided to port their code to C++ and the rest, as they say, is history that never was.<p>[1] It is interesting to think that Apple would build its future in ways that treated the browser as a commodity - first with the iPod and then with the app store.<p>[2]  See Slava Akhmechet&#x27;s   <i>The Nature of Lisp</i>.

7326044,comment,7324984,7324984,5,0,dmunoz,,,"> Simple debugging. This is an area where AI techniques could be quite helpful.\nDetecting and explaining common syntax and runtime errors is a crucial step in\nteaching a new language. Tools which provide this type of support could increase\nthe interest in this language in the mainstream. Our current debugging support is\nminimal and provides only the basic commands: step, skip, and continue.<p>I have given some thought to this in the past. Has there ever been a serious attempt at this?<p>Sometimes the error messages for really simple mistakes (missing semicolon, wrong punctuation, etc.) are obtuse and almost completely meaningless. Of course, if it were easy to give simple, clear error message in such cases, they resulting message would be simple, so it&#x27;s other complexities that get in the way. The biggest problem I see is that having labelled training data, e.g. source code that fails compilation along with the specific actual error, is unlikely, and having an expert provide small, self-contained examples is unlikely to be useful (really, enough training data to be effective) in real world errors, even when novice programs are fairly small.<p>Edit: I was just thinking about this, and with prudent use of a VCS, labelled training data would just be pairs of the form <commit that fails, next commit that compiles>. It would be interesting to see if it&#x27;s possible to pull useful data from exiting history, or if some level of restraint is necessary in practice. Really, I&#x27;m just thinking about the precipice of supervised and unsupervised learning here.",1393707133

7326023,comment,,7323751,1,0,aaplthrowaway,,,"> My experience of living outside of the Apple ecosystem is that Apple stuff is all or nothing. One can&#x27;t choose to have some Apple gear without fully embracing it. The advertised benefits require one to buy into everything. Things like iPods and Ubuntu aren&#x27;t seamless<p>I think you are overrating those &quot;advertised benefits&quot;.<p>Sure, there are some conveniences when you use multiple Apple devices, such as iMessage, iCloud tabs, iCloud passwords, iCloud Storage. But it&#x27;s nothing that you can&#x27;t get with third party apps like WhatsApp or 1Password, or even Google Chrome.<p>iCloud Storage depends on apps implementing it. They could use any other solution, such as Dropbox or Box.net, but then you would have another kind of lock-in.<p>And yes, iTunes doesn&#x27;t work on Ubuntu, but it&#x27;s not like you need iTunes for a fully operational phone, nor you need a Mac for iTunes. I don&#x27;t think I synced my iPhone to Mac in a few years. And it&#x27;s been a while since I last used Linux, so I don&#x27;t know if those still work, but if you had to sync MP3 music you could use Amarok or GtkPod... or even Wine...<p>So, yes, it&#x27;s not really seamless but it&#x27;s not like you absolutely <i>have</i> to buy a Mac to have all the advantages of having an iDevice...<p>And yes, I get it, it isn&#x27;t open, etc, but my the point is that you absolutely don&#x27;t need to &quot;buy into everything&quot; to have all the conveniences.

I catted around for a bit looking for work in renewables, transit, or anything remotely similar, but found the jobs were very few and the pay worse.  I opted for the next-best thing and ended up in one of the two great catabolic endeavors:  software and IT (the other is, of course, finance).  I&#x27;ve been <i>very</i> disenchanted with what Silicon Valley&#x27;s turned out over the past decade.<p>And so long as we&#x27;re relying on the naive market principle to guide us, I think that&#x27;s the best we can hope for.  I&#x27;m not sure alternatives can do a whole lot better, but some level of guided state or higher-level directed investment and planning might help.  Or not.<p>As for the patronage funding model:  I suspect that&#x27;s going to be what&#x27;s increasingly common, particularly for science and the arts, possibly also technical ventures.

There are a number of flaws with this line of reasoning. To name a few:<p>* The NSA could have been involved with backdoors before 2013 (unlikely in Debian, but mentioning 2013 is a bit of a red herring)<p>* Apple could have been encouraged to insert a backdoor and did so in a way that gave them plausible deniability (either because the NSA specified that, or because they wanted to cover their behinds)<p>Whether or not this incident was the result of the NSA&#x27;s prompting is something we&#x27;ll probably never know[0], but this article doesn&#x27;t do much to argue one way or the other.<p>[0] The only way we could know is if someone literally came out and admitted it (or someone like Snowden were to leak it).

7325966,comment,7321660,7325317,1,0,FD3SA,,,"I don&#x27;t think crowdfunding will work for science. Science is the turtle in the race. Long, slow and steady is how every single breakthrough has occurred, because it requires setting foundations that take decades. Crowdfunding is the most unstable funding source, and thus involves a level of uncertainty that no professional could live with on a long term basis. It&#x27;s great for small, self contained projects with a clear goal. Not for quests into the unknown.<p>Furthermore, the average person has no understanding of the history, practice, and effects of scientific research. They don&#x27;t realize that the unbelievable technologies we enjoy today are a result of very concerted efforts throughout history to advance the state of our understanding. The iPhone is a result of the accumulation of every discovery made by mankind since the inception of our species. This is not what the average person thinks when they hold an iPhone. As such, I believe crowdfunding will be for a very small niche of like minded people. That does not compare to the resources available through taxation.<p>From the article:<p>“A Fred Sanger would not survive today’s world of science. With continuous reporting and appraisals, some committee would note that he published little of import between insulin in 1952 and his first paper on RNA sequencing in 1967 with another long gap until DNA sequencing in 1977. He would be labelled as unproductive, and his modest personal support would be denied. We no longer have a culture that allows individuals to embark on long-term—and what would be considered today extremely risky—projects.”<p>From Peter Higgs [1]:<p>&quot;The emeritus professor ... published fewer than 10 papers after his groundbreaking work, which identified the mechanism by which subatomic material acquires mass, was published in 1964.<p>Higgs, 84, said he would almost certainly have been sacked had he not been nominated for the Nobel in 1980.<p>Edinburgh University&#x27;s authorities then took the view, he later learned, that he &quot;might get a Nobel prize – and if he doesn&#x27;t we can always get rid of him&quot;.<p>Higgs said he became &quot;an embarrassment to the department when they did research assessment exercises&quot;. A message would go around the department saying: &quot;Please give a list of your recent publications.&quot; Higgs said: &quot;I would send back a statement: &#x27;None.&#x27; &quot;<p>1. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-b...</a>",1393705928

Some types like tuples that are used more in F# than in C# are reference types, so you might want to avoid them in your inner loops, but that generally just means writing F# that looks a bit more like C#.  Likewise, as to the number of function calls, it&#x27;s probably a question of style more than features, though you can do things like use the `inline` keyword to make sure that particular functions always get inlined at call sites, which can be a big win in some cases (it also allows you to write type-safe generic math code, which is an oft-lamented unsupported scenario in C#).  Lots of people are making good use of F# in contexts where heavy computational requirements exist (e.g. finance or scientific computing), but I&#x27;m not too familiar with projects using it where more real-time requirements exist (though I think someone&#x27;s in the midst of porting Quake III to F#, so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how that goes).",1393705687

7325910,comment,7324079,7324079,3,0,kvb,,,"I love F# dearly, and despite having spent several years writing C# code earlier in my career, I still find switching back to C# from F# painful in lots of little ways.<p>But I think this post is off-base.  First, it criticizes C# both for incorporating too many of F#&#x27;s features, but also of stagnating.  I just don&#x27;t see how anyone can consider C# to be stagnating... of the heavily-used-in-industry set of languages, is there any that&#x27;s evolving faster?  Java&#x27;s just now getting lambdas, for instance!<p>Secondly, I think the lack of promotion of F# by Microsoft is somewhat lamentable (though the community has done a great job of picking up the slack).  But I think Microsoft&#x27;s in a bit of a bind - they&#x27;ve received a lot of criticism for having too much churn in the ecosystem (e.g. ADO -> ADO.NET -> LINQ-to-SQL -> LINQ-to-Entities).  So how would the community react to the statement, &quot;you should really be using F# instead of C# going forward&quot; (even if decision makers believed that)?  Undoubtedly people would feel that the investment they&#x27;d made in learning C# was not worth as much as they thought and they&#x27;d start looking into more stable ecosystems (I&#x27;m mainly referring here to LOB app developers, who seem to greatly value stability of their platform).<p>Furthermore, in some ways these changes make the on-ramp from C# to F# even easier, which is a good thing.  And C#&#x27;s still missing so many great F# features that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to get too worried about the ones that have been mimicked.  And I think it&#x27;s somewhat true that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and having many great features spreading to other languages is a good thing.",1393705016

We&#x27;ve had a lot of different proposals for the latter over the years and my impression is their lack of adoption hasn&#x27;t been because DNSSEC is fundamentally broken (though it is flawed in several ways).  AFAICT it breaks down like this:<p>Against DNSSEC + certificate records:<p>1) There&#x27;s a centralized PKI administration issue, but less so than the current CA morass\n2) Administrative/rubber hose/legal/monetary compromise of the DNS root administrators (currently US NTIA) would allow substitution of the TLD keys, but this would be blatantly obvious to every organization or individual paying attention\n3) DNSSEC has some annoying properties with regard to name enumeration and such\n4) Need to either use a primary resolver that supports DNSSEC (Google Public DNS and Comcast, among others) or do a separate query to one who does<p>For:<p>5) Minimal extra infrastructure, already supported in some libraries\n6) Extremely cacheable with low resource requirements (root & TLD keys, MRU/MFU certs)\n7) No need to add a new dependency on a previously untrusted source of code and crypto data\n8) As long as the parent TLD has deployed DNSSEC the organization only needs to get their key set up, add a theoretical cert record, and sign records as needed.<p>I think issues 1 & 2 are at least as big a problem with DNSChain because in practice the hand-waving of how you pick a trusted DNSChain chain is ignoring a huge class of vulnerabilities.  Issue 4 is still a win over implementing a large chunk of infrastructure or trusting okTurtles&#x27;.  The &quot;just use Javascript&quot; bit seems to apply equally to either, though I guess the _query_ portion of DNSChain is relatively simple.",1393704954

7325863,comment,7324079,7325829,1,0,kevingadd,,,"Glad to hear it. The main problem I noticed the last time I used F# is that it generates more function calls, along with more heap references (vs stack-allocated structs) for things like boxed values, generators, etc to do simple tasks compared with C#. Is it the case that you can optimize all this out using parts of the language I don&#x27;t know about?",1393704189

Both are brilliant, and both are flawed in their own ways, but, in my view, Luttwak’s writing is more often reliable as giving you actually correct information (though selectively, with a slant towards his broader agenda of policy influence), whereas Kissinger is better at obtaining access and favor.  They are kind of a real life Jewish immigrants versions of the ‘Once an Eagle‘ duo where Kissinger is Massengale and Luttwak is Damon.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m done with the article.

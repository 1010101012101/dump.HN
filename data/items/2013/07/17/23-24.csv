6060821,comment,6057952,6060346,2,0,achompas,,,"Sure thing. Sorry for the previous terseness--I really really really hate this whole &quot;Coursera --> Kaggle --> DS job at Facebook&quot; meme when it (rarely) appears on HN, since it isn&#x27;t even close to reality.<p>I&#x27;m not a data scientist, but I work with them very closely as an engineer and I&#x27;ve considered going down the same path. When I talk about data scientists, it&#x27;s not a reference to any of the following:<p>> Engineers working with big data technology, like Hadoop, Storm, Kafka, who are essential but often uninvolved in model construction and evaluation.<p>> Analysts who develop models, then hand them off to engineers/IT to code them up (or keep them in Excel spreadsheets).<p>Instead, I&#x27;m thinking about someone with a specific background. They likely have a PhD, since that&#x27;s an excellent way to experience the &quot;ask-explore-code-test-present&quot; workflow needed to answer an interesting question with real-world implications. The strong academic background is not necessary, but it greatly reduces friction during the research workflow (since you&#x27;ve spent 3-4 years in it). I&#x27;m getting a MS and working hard to make it as research-oriented as possible, fwiw.<p>This person also has a strong foundation in applied math. They might have worked on signal processing questions, applied algorithms for learning Bayesian network structure to proteins, or thought about the transition from Hopfield networks to RBNs or whatever awesome deep learning stuff is going on nowadays. A guy I respect described this quality as that of &quot;a traveler,&quot; someone who can understand advanced work in a number of disciplines in addition to their specialty.<p>This person is an engineer. They learn languages easily, understand algorithmic complexity and think about the complexity of their models. They don&#x27;t have to be Linus.<p>Finally, the person is forward-thinking. They understand that questions are motivated by business needs, and that answering these questions can have serious implications for the company or its partners. I should channel patio11 here!<p>Anyway I&#x27;m obviously very opinionated about this, but it&#x27;s just one opinion. I&#x27;m happy to discuss this more with anyone who&#x27;s interested, though--contact is in my profile.",1374105585

6060819,comment,6055452,6058390,1,0,lukifer,,,"In brief: (a) We have an entrenched two-party system that makes a big show of conflict and gridlock, yet manages to collude on a surprising number of issues on behalf of the same donors and powerful lobbies; (b) Elections have become a marketing game, and no one can hope to run on a national level without massive amounts of capital, which means not rocking the boat of the corporate welfare state, or upsetting any other PAC donors who are playing &quot;asynchronous quid pro quo&quot;.<p>I see three possible solutions, any of which would help, but all of which I&#x27;d like to see:<p>- Campaign Finance Reform: there are many potential ways to do this, the most straight-forward being publicly financed elections. This seems expensive, except when you compare it to the &quot;media-electoral complex&quot; we have now. Congress should not have to spend as much time as it does on fundraising, and should not be so motivated to accept kickbacks to PACs.<p>- Instant Runoff Voting: This would give third parties a chance to actually win by removing the &quot;spoiler effect&quot;. It&#x27;s a richer way to measure what the voters actually want, instead of continually forcing a choice of lesser evils. Anyone who still wants to cast their vote for a single party still can. Meanwhile, the mainstream parties would take third parties as a more serious threat, and focus more on the desires of their base, rather than taking them for granted and spending all their energy on a handful of politically inactive undecideds.<p>- None of the Above: Allow voters to choose none of the candidates as an option, forcing a new election. This would bring the protest non-voters back to the polls, the people who are so jaded that they believe (with cause) that voting is pointless, and whose opinions are going uncounted.<p>There are also other ideas like Proportional Representation, but that would represent a massive shift in our political structure, and so is probably not realistic. The above three options could be bolted on to our existing framework on a state-by-state level, or (theoretically) by Constitutional Amendment.<p>The problem is, both major parties and their donors benefit massively from the current system, and so it would take a <i>huge</i> upswell of public support to force a change. (Media companies would also fight tooth and nail; political advertising is a major source of revenue.) On the other hand, those members of Congress who are not blatantly corrupt don&#x27;t like having to spend so much time fundraising, so it&#x27;s not a completely uphill battle once critical mass is reached.",1374105574

I was able to select and move several thousand messages through the web interface when I was first configuring it.<p>FastMail&#x27;s highlights for me are:<p>- Really good, customizable &quot;personalities&quot; (alternate email addresses with their own SMPT servers, auto-BCC settings, etc.)<p>- Sieve support -- SO much more powerful than rules in Gmail, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_(mail_filtering_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_(mail_filtering_language)</a><p>- Customer support that actually responds and is super helpful in my experience<p>- Ability to use your own domain name(s) without all the overhead of signing up for Google Apps.<p>- Jabber support (not in-browser, but they do have a server that works with Adium/iChat/Pidgin)<p>- Very fast, modern web interface. Definitely faster than Gmail for me. Good keyboard shortcuts too (very similar to Gmail&#x27;s but with a few differences).<p>- An archive folder that works well with the archive functionality in Mail.app and other clients.<p>The only thing that isn&#x27;t great is search. It works ok for everything but searching within messages (i.e. from/to/subject searches are fine). I believe FastMail does have support for a lot more search operators than Gmail and can search headers as well. But I&#x27;m not an expert on the power user search features for either.<p>This is because I actually use the search in Mail.app on my Mac, which is actually better than Gmail&#x27;s search capabilities for every search I&#x27;ve tried (same good results, but way faster). Obviously works great with FastMail too, and I figure it&#x27;s good to have a local copy of email.<p>I also miss a few things from the (old) gmail interface, but I definitely like FastMail&#x27;s interface better on the whole than the new compose in Gmail. Things I miss in FastMail are the mainly the ability to pop composing a message into a new window with one click and sync with the address book on my phone. Neither are deal breakers.<p>I actually use MailMate (<a href=""http://freron.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freron.com</a>) for the majority of my email access now. It&#x27;s still a little rough around the edges but being able to compose emails in Markdown and see the entire hierarchy of a thread (not flattened into one level) is worth a bit of UX pain.",1374105508

I&#x27;ve only worked with a real option calculator once about 6 years ago.  with that being said, here&#x27;s my thinking on real options: You can do a much better analysis with a real options calculator, but you would have to make a lot of assumptions in your real option calculator about the different branches the individual could travel down at each node. At some point you could say that there is some very unlikely probability that this job allowed the person to travel down a path in 5 years that enabled them to start their own company and IPO&#x27;d that company. This would have an impact on the value of the options offered today, but I cannot imagine all of the possibilities of a real option calculator.",1374105313

About two years ago everybody started to speak about startups. It sounded so sexy to become a startupper. So I wanted a startup. I found a nice idea I sat down write the whole strategy alone planned all the way till IPO and till sunbathing on my huge yacht. Than I went to a developer company and spent all my money to have the Final Product created. I have not even told my mother what the idea was. To say it short I didnt have a clue about startups, not to mention lean, idea validation, etc. I lost all my money and the project was a total failure. Than I stood up and spent a year on learning, reading and discussing the industry. I started to respect my own time, money and efforts. A month ago I had a new idea that still looks promising. Having my previous learning and being in the advantageous situation of not having a lot of money to spend, now I follow lean, think and rethink, test each assumption and talk with as many people as I can. Overall I become a much more opened and friendly person. My friends keep on saying I am a new person (in a good meaning).",1374105206

There is a moral dilemma between spending money now to feed 100 people versus teaching one person to fish for a lifetime. That is a tough dilemma to solve. But different charities approach this in different ways.<p>The philosophy behind Kiva is to help people build sustainable businesses in poorer countries which have semi-functioning states (say poorer Latin American countries prone to dictatorships but still have some notion of property rights and trials for murders). This has the potential to bring entire communities to a more well-off state. Is it a good use of money? Undoubtedly. Are you better off giving that money to better charities that target people with more acute needs? Probably.<p>Here&#x27;s another example: you might have seen criticism of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for spending lots of money on eradicating polio. The argument is that instead of spending upwards of $1000 a head on eradicating Polio (cost divided by number of annual polio deaths), they could spend that at $10 a head on reducing malaria deaths. The counter argument is that _eradication_ is a huge win because once you&#x27;ve eradicated polio you can stop all future payments on Polio containment (which is in the billions of dollars annually) because you&#x27;ve permanently solved the problem, for present and future poor people. It turns out that the net present value of all those future payments equaling zero (just as today we spend zero dollars on small pox containment and treatment and vaccination now that we&#x27;ve eradicated it) makes it worth it to actually spend a disproportionate amount of money on polio vaccines on the ground (as the Gates foundation is doing), even if the marginal dollar saves less lives today than if we put it into malaria vaccines.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this line of work, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is probably one of the best charities out there, since they actually grapple with these questions. But they&#x27;re not actually capital starved (they&#x27;re spending money as fast as they can). To answer that meta-question, you should look at GiveWell, which is probably the best meta-charity (they actually evaluate charities, and also factor in things like scalability, so they rank charities but also state how much money they think that charity needs before your marginal dollar should be allocated to the next one on the list since the first one will have enough money to accomplish their goals). They also look at how well run the charities are at actually accomplishing what they want to accomplish, etc.<p>In short, if you want to do the most good in a utilitarian sense, you can&#x27;t do any better than going to GiveWell and donating to charities as per their recommendation. Honestly, if you needed to calculate a joint probability function over total human utility, and wanted to target your dollars at maximizing that function, Holden Karnofsky (the guy at the head of GiveWell) is exactly the person you should be asking.",1374103399

If being able to treat a value differently than it was received, or to perform computations that you shouldn&#x27;t be able to, e.g. impure actions inside a pure function, then very few languages satisfy that property.

It can try to convert your value to a value of type Closer, which is an interface that implements a method Close(), and it can use that method. This conversion will succeed if the value you pass in has a method Close() (taking no arguments) -- Go has a strong &quot;loose coupling&quot; philosophy; there is no &quot;implements.&quot;<p>For example, you can do:<p>nfoo, ok := foo.(myCustomInterface)<p>where foo is any value. If foo implements myCustomInterface (indicated by ok being True), regardless of whether that interface is exported or not, or whether the person behind foo intended to implement it, then you will be able to call myCustomInterface&#x27;s methods on nfoo. It&#x27;s not exactly duck typing, but it does mean that taking a value implementing SomeInterface is no guarantee that you can only use the methods defined by SomeInterface.<p>See my explanation here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6060627"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6060627</a>",1374103084

If I can get away with it, I&#x27;ll put together a bash script built out of pipelines of Unix utilities and various others I&#x27;ve written over the years. I&#x27;m reluctant to write for-purpose apps; I try to make them fit into a Unix-style paradigm of streams combined with some command-line options.<p>For example, I recently wrote a simple video editor to select clips from my motorbike commuting videos. The only platform-specific bit is the video player, and all it does is respond to keyboard commands to navigate backwards and forwards and mark positions, in response to which it writes out text to standard out. I have other scripts which drive ffmpeg or other utilities as necessary to do the heavy lifting of cutting and composing. And to port it to another OS, all I need write anew is a video-playing component. And things like parallelization for efficiency, process isolation for resilience, and job control to temporarily reduce CPU usage (perhaps to avoid overheating on reencode!) are trivial.<p>For work, all my testing is done from the command-line, much of the code tweaks, all source control, merge resolution, grep / sed / etc. Debugging is usually done with repls like pry for Ruby. Browser at work is primarily used for distraction while having a coffee and waiting for tests to run, or to interact with company web apps.<p>Things like web browsers (Firefox in my case, because of tree-style tabs more than anything else) are invariant across platforms. If you live entirely in the browser, you don&#x27;t need to deal with, or even know anything about, the machine&#x27;s OS. So I don&#x27;t really consider that use case an interaction.",1374102170

6060588,comment,6060143,6060143,15,0,grellas,,,"This is a nice piece and I would certainly commend it to founders for its insights.<p>Of course, much of Silicon Valley is a living testament to the fact that options can have incredible value for the right cases. Every startup has a rhythm to it and, if you are holding .5% of a &quot;hot&quot; startup in the form of options having a low exercise price, it normally is worth the gamble of biding your time, taking reduced pay, and seeing if the big payday will come. Many founders think in these terms and, if their startup fails to galvanize and moves instead in only fits and starts, will seek to cut their losses and move on. In this sense, the perceived value of the options as seen at the entry point does not turn on what average returns may be for such options considered generically among the entire universe of startups. It turns on more subjective factors such as whether the startup is doing something exciting, whether its key people make up a strong team, whether it has attracted quality backing, and the like. If those factors are there, then founders do not really view it as a matter of average returns across a broad class of startup types but rather view it as a matter of the likelihood of a big outcome for the particular startup being considered.<p>That said, options can prove illusory in many cases and caution is definitely in order. It normally does not pay to hang in with an uneven venture in the vague hope that it can somehow turn things around and yield a great equity return for your small piece of the company. Among other things, if a venture goes through multiple rounds of funding, the liquidation preferences get to be so great that option holders may easily get a very reduced payout, or even no payout whatever, on acquisition. Also, if you hang around while all your options vest and then leave the company, you typically have only 90 days within which to exercise them or you lose them altogether. That means a cash payout that only increases your risk or, even worse than that, a large tax hit with no cash return if the stock price is high following a series of fundings. Of course, there are (as the author notes) many good reasons to be in a startup apart from equity payout and it may still be worthwhile to stick it out in a doubtful venture for a time owing to those other reasons. But don&#x27;t stick with a dubious venture based primarily on the hoped-for equity payout in such cases because, in that case, the odds definitely <i>are</i> against you.",1374102010

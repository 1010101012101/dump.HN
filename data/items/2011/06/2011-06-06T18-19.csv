What he says (in the source linked to by this article) is:<p>> ""It's an online form of money laundering used to disguise the source of money, and to disguise who's both selling and buying the drug""<p>From the article, it's not clear what the ""it"" refers to; while it's possible it refers to bitcoin in general, it sounds more to me like he's talking about the use of bitcoin on silkroad, in which case I believe his statement is completely factual.<p>There's really not much remarkable here about bitcoin other than its appearance in a statement by a prominent senator and mention in a mainstream news article. If you accept that the government should be able to regulate or outlaw the drug trade, there's nothing remarkable here at all. I recognize that there is a significant population here who might think that drug sales and use should not be regulated, but the majority of the American public does not agree with you.",1307386799

2625914,comment,2625605,2625837,19,0,ansy,,,"This is par for the course with Apple. I remember back in the day there was this super popular shareware app called Aaron that gave System 7 users a System 8 looking theme. Keep in mind this was the dark ages of Apple.<p>Aaron evolved into Kaleidoscope. A general purpose shareware theme manager that was met with enthusiasm by the Mac community. Kaleidoscope was synonymous with themes on Mac OS.<p><a href=""http://www.kaleidoscope.net/What_is_Kaleidoscope.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kaleidoscope.net/What_is_Kaleidoscope.html</a><p>By the time OS 8.5 rolled around Apple introduced Appearance Manager. Which was no more than a total rip off of Kaleidoscope. Apple engineers even wrote an internal utility that would convert Kaleidoscope themes into Appearance Manager themes.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appearance_Manager#Kaleidoscope"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appearance_Manager#Kaleidoscope</a><p>The shareware author got zero credit. Zero money. He just got ripped off by Apple. In the end, though, Appearance Manager never took off. It was a combination of Kaleidoscope's momentum and the taint of Appearance Manager that kept theme authors from adopting it.<p>EDIT: I also add the story of Konfabulator, written later by some of the same people that did Kaleidoscope. Konfabulator was also ripped off by Apple in the form of Dashboard.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(software)#Comparison_with_Konfabulator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(software)#Comparison...</a>",1307386774

First, the GPGPU thing really hasn't affected Intel, who still sells more units than either AMD or nVidia, and will probably continue to have a stranglehold on their current markets. GPGPU really doesn't matter to most people.<p>Second, the guy that wrote this code, Chris Wilson, is one of the big guys behind Cairo and had an experiment, cairo-drm, where he plugged Cairo directly to an Intel graphics chipset by talking directly to the kernel and bypassing the Intel X drivers.

OS X is more similar to bios updates... you buy the hardware, the vendor makes money off it and gives away the software. With Microsoft, you're paying the OEM money for the hardware(with razor thin margins usually but that's another story), so Microsoft doesn't make bank on expensive hardware and upgrades to RAM/HDD/CPU that Apple makes.<p>Edit: Not to mention that 10.5 to 10.7 is not upgradeable, you have to buy and install 10.6 first, install the App Store and then install 10.7.

After all, HBO doesn't really care how its subscribers consume its content: be it on the HBO Go iPad app, cable on-demand, DVR, TV, iTunes, or even (to some extent) by way of piracy (1). After all, it's monetizing the subscribers one way or the other. Networks can't count on the same, and if they try to transition to a premium cable model, they'll face stiff consumer resistance from a user base accustomed to getting its network content free of charge.<p>(1) The reason HBO doesn't need to care about piracy as much as networks do is somewhat counterintuitive. You'd think that, since HBO monetizes viewers directly, it should be deeply concerned with losing viewers to piracy. But actually, there's a reasonable argument to be made that HBO <i>gains</i> more users from piracy than it loses. Piracy serves as a great marketing vehicle for HBO's content, while not really stealing away a significant number of current users. Net-net, HBO might actually be better off for the existence of piracy. But that's just a hypothesis.<p>(2) Eventually, HBO will need to adapt its subscription model, which is predicated on semi-indirectly monetizing users by way of monetizing cable providers based on size of user base (among other factors). What does the adaptation look like? I'd imagine it's a future in which all cloud-based curators of content (Apple, Netflix, etc.) are monetized by HBO and other providers in a similar fashion to how HBO currently monetizes cable networks. In this sense, I don't think a la carte is totally going to replace subscription models for HBO and its ilk. It might be a nice complement to, but certainly not an immediate replacement for, business as usual.",1307384970

The only 'real' law is the Sparrow Predicate: what a man can't do, and what a man can do.  _Everything else is built upon this._<p>That is to say, it is distracting and adding nothing sensible to point out that physical property, too, is an abstraction--it is merely an extension of the original point, which is: people don't buy into the intellectual property concept nearly as much as the physical property concept.",1307383936

2625686,comment,2623182,2623747,1,0,dadkins,,,"Forward exercising in an early stage startup is a great idea.  The company doesn't yet have a meaningful valuation so you can exercise for next to nothing.  The board typically sets the strike price of options low so that employees don't wonder if their options are already underwater.  Also, by exercising early you pretty much guarantee that there is no difference between strike price and value at time of exercise, so you owe no taxes up front.  Later, near IPO, when the value is much higher and set by external factors, it's no longer a good idea.<p>By exercising early, you effectively own stock at the date of exercise.  If the company goes public or gets acquired, your gains are already long term capital gains as long as it's been a year.  Also, you don't have to wait once the company goes public to exercise your options, then wait a year... you can sell right away, lock-up periods aside.<p>To summarize, early exercise is a cheap way to avoid paying taxes on your options until you sell the shares later.  And then you're paying the long term capital gains rate on cash earned, instead of short term capital gains on a volatile stock which could easily go down in value.",1307383829

The outlines are very clear: Bitcoin allows nearly complete escape from the current financial regulatory systems that control currency movements and taxation. Trying to prevent people from moving money from one country to another or using Bitcoins for buying drugs, weapons, whatever is impossible without a truly draconian censorship and control regime in which private citizens are more or less forbidden from using encrypted communications.<p>I see government control over money as basically an immovable object - I don't think so-called constitutional protections mean anything when it comes to governments doing what they feel is necessary to maintain control. Internet freedom and encryption are not as much of an irresistible force as net-romantics would like to think.<p>If anything can force governments into legislating backdoors into all encryption systems and creating a clearly established set of ""choke points"" for control of data flows, it is the possibility of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies to render basic imperatives of the modern nation state impossible to enforce.<p>It is more or less infinitely depressing to me, because as much as I would like to believe that the ""good guys"" are going to win, I doubt it. People generally don't realize how much we are already living in a dystopian panopticon, and Bitcoin is one of the rays of light shining through the cracks in the prison walls.<p>What is even more depressing to me is my own cowardice. I am too scared of the US government to even try to resist in any way, no matter how trivial. I would like to participate in Bitcoin and other projects, but I don't want to end up in a federal prison for conspiracy to assist in money laundering and tax evasion, as I imagine that any participation in Bitcoin will be interpreted by government prosecutors of the near-future.",1307383528

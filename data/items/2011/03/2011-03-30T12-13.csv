2386950,comment,2386392,2386392,8,0,trotsky,,,"People who grow interested in participating in the bitcoin market because of this or other articles about the currency should be aware that at its heart it is a very speculative market. The price of a bitcoin in USD has risen dramatically through most of its life while lacking economic fundamentals for why it should.<p>Indeed, the money supply in the bitcoin market increases steadily over time, this should be inflationary, causing the value of BTC to fall. The fact that it doesn't speaks to how thinly traded the BTC markets are, and that there are simply more buyers than sellers interested in BTC - primarily due to articles about bitcoin that drum up interest, and due to speculators participating in the market.<p>Bitcoin values are very loosely coupled to fundamentals - you can't buy food, energy or commodities with it. In general you need to transfer it back to a fiat currency to do anything classically useful with it. Currencies that either rapidly appreciate or rapidly depreciate are both ill suited for any kind of real commerce - people need relatively stable pricing to conduct any kind of direct business in fiat money. While there are certainly examples where fiat currency runs away in either inflationary or deflationary ways, central banks, charged with protecting their currencies often take dramatic steps at times to prevent moves either way.<p>In these ways bitcoin currently resembles either a pump and dump scheme the tulip bubble. Which it is depends on whether you believe the people driving the rises in pricing are intentionally exploiting the press and thin nature of the market, or if most of the participants are simply along for the speculative ride.<p>Of course, it is in the rational best interests of anyone who holds bitcoin to disagree with this assessment. That said, I do genuinely welcome any kind of informed debate on the issue.",1301489807

If that article receives x number of upvotes, then you get them all back -- otherwise, they're gone.<p>For each subsequent article following a situation in which you did not get refunded, the cost doubles.<p>So, the scenario would be like this:<p>- new users can submit articles after they've attained 5 karma points, which are spent upon submission.<p>- If the article gets upvoted 5 times, the karma is refunded, and the cost is still 5 karma to submit.<p>- If the article does not get upvoted 5 times (or is flagged more than upvoted, or whatever) then the user loses the karma cost, and their next submission costs 10 karma.  If the user doesn't have 10 karma, they can't submit.<p>There is a low entry cost, and good submissions aren't penalized, while bad or negative submissions are penalized progressively.  There is no point at which the user is 'banned', but they have to earn progressively more and more karma to keep submitting.  For high-karma users, this should allow them the luxury of gambling some karma on things they want shown, while lower-karma members have to be more mindful of whether they think this is worth gambling their karma on.",1301489402

Most people just dont know the difference.</i><p>Well, here's the difference (according to Wikipedia):<p>Parallelism - a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously, operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved concurrently (""in parallel""). There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.<p>Concurrency - a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. The computations may be executing on multiple cores in the same chip, preemptively time-shared threads on the same processor, or executed on physically separated processors. A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including Petri nets, process calculi, the Parallel Random Access Machine model and the Actor model.",1301489112

They can regulate the exchange of BitCoin into everyday fiat currencies. We seen this with the likes of e-gold when exchangers were cracked down on due to the ease of laundering money in the system.<p>3)Value, if people have no faith in the value of BitCoins then the system will not work. Right not there's a lot of commerce with BitCoin but it seems that it's only digital products or services that are accepting it. Once sellers of physical products start accepting BitCoin then it might become are more common currency.<p>4)Drugs, CP and money laundering. Although I don't believe in the scaremongering tactics used by politicians in order to regulate the likes of the internet, this system is going to be vulnerable to the similar attacks. We've already seen narcotics marketplaces open up that are now accepting BitCoin by operating through the TOR network. Soon enough this will receive a lot of unwanted attention.",1301488416

Here is an updated version of your work. I went through and replaced all the asterisks with the letters. The lines I replaced are in lowercase. The asterisks that remain are characters that are to scribbled to read.<p>The lines that Have the dash - next to them stand out heavily. As someone has stated before (I believe it was thinkalone 6), they may represent Interstates. 
The biggest question is what language did Ricky McCormick speak? Was he known to use any slang?<p>Another part that stuck out at me was the numbers 99.84.52. I would have to take a punch and say that it is a PO box combination code. I put the numbers in brackets {---} to spot easlily. But what got me was the lines before and after the numbers, 651MTCSEHTLSENCUTCTRSNMRE and UNEP25ENCRSEAOKTSENSKSENrSE It has to be an address of some sort and location. UNEP25ENCRSEAOKT. This looks possibly like an adress. I focused on that portion for a few minutes and could not bypass the feeling of an address. Where to I dont know. But thats all Ihave for now. I am going to get some sleep and dive back into it when I wake up. If you have any comments or even something to help or add, Email me when you reply so that I will know when to check. Thanks! Y!

Most people just dont know the diffrence.<p>> Not that I don't like clojure, but part of the hype is that it's supposed to do a lot of the scaling inherently just by the design of the language.<p>That wasn't a designgoal of clojure to provid parallism just out of box. It maybe is a designgoal now because everybody wants it to be.<p>> But in reality it's never that simple. Switching from map to pmap doesn't do much, actually a whole different way of writing the code is necessary. I'd like to see a version of this that tries to maximise multi core performance, and see what a 12-core mac pro can do with the execution times.<p>pmap does work great for some things but just thinking you can throw in some 'p'-s want wrok.

Moved to Beijing, real estate in 2007 was at a premium.  Its even more so now since the Olympic games.   Apparently prices have risen dramatically, the demand is incredible.<p>The same cannot be said for the rest of the country.  Many apartments are owned by companies anticipating renting the rooms to their workers.  One of the buildings I was initially staying in was a dorm room sharing with other developers in my team.  With wages so low it was difficult if not impossible for many of them to afford an apartment.<p>Many other apartments are owned by overseas Chinese, investing in their locality, awaiting their return.",1301486801

Of late DataTables has proven to be reasonably popular, which I'm absolutely delighted with - but with that comes a lot more support requests for integrating the library into pages and apps.<p>As a result of this, I now find that what time I can spend on the project is spent answering questions in the forum and not taking the core project forward. Even then I can't keep up with the number of posts in the forum! When that happens, inevitably, there come questions such as ""is this forum alive"" etc. I've even been accused of making the forum rubbish intentionally to ""force"" people to make a donation to get support (the reality is that very few people do make a support request using that method).<p>Please don't misunderstand, asking questions is great! It is how we all learn after all. I want to be able to help people do the integration that they want to do with DataTables - but at the same time I want to be able to improve the library going forward.<p>So what I wanted to ask was, how do other developers maintain their development to support ratio? Does anyone have any suggestions for how to get a balance?",1301486600

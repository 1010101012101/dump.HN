9025737,comment,9023582,9025215,0,0,aceperry,,,"Not sure what you mean by where my info went wrong, but my friend worked at a MS datacenter a few years ago, so I don&#x27;t know what has changed.  At the time, almost all of the techs working at the DC were contractors, not MSFT employees.  They were severely understaffed and getting cut back constantly.  There were a few different companies doing the contracting as well, and all of them were under the threat of losing out to a lower bid company.  The competent techs were getting outnumbered by incompetent techs.  That and the fact that MS couldn&#x27;t even renew basic registrations and certificates didn&#x27;t surprise me with my poor experience with Azure.<p>Again, this was a couple of years ago.  Also, I attended an event that MS held to show off Azure, and a large percentage of participants couldn&#x27;t spin up an instance within 10 minutes, some of them didn&#x27;t even start up.  The MS people running the event had a direct line to some techs in the datacenter, but they still couldn&#x27;t solve the problems.  I talked with some MS partners/users who told me that Azure was terrible in their experience and even some MS execs admitted as much in private conversation.  It sounds like Azure has improved since then, but I really have to wonder how much improvement has occured.",1423550939

Just pick a day and spend it replacing passwords. As a side effect, you get a mental update on exactly what identities you&#x27;re managing and whether or not you want to modify or close them.<p>This should be fairly straightforward even for non-technical people, if they&#x27;ve got a grasp on actually using the password manager itself. The hard part is (1) getting the list of identities, which isn&#x27;t too hard if you&#x27;re hand-holding, and (2) actually remembering to do it. (Which is why annual is nice. You can peg it to a holiday you already celebrate, or substitute it for one you don&#x27;t. Halloween, for instance, because breaches are scary?

9025726,comment,9022676,9025390,0,0,orbifold,,,"Perhaps a few points of clarification are in order, my original comment had too many different threads mixed together. I will first try to expand on my remarks on copying and then try to respond to some of the things you said.<p>When you look at the categories in use by mathematicians a surprisingly large number of them are not cartesian, this is true in particular of the categories relevant to physics, where both the category of symplectic manifolds (relevant to classical mechanics) and Hilbert spaces (relevant to Quantum Mechanics) are monoidal and not cartesian. In both cases you therefore <i>can not</i> copy states.<p>Moreover in physics things are local in the sense that the dynamics of a physical system is usually determined by differential equations. That means there is typically no situation where you have to retain much of the state of the system for a long time in order to simulate its behavior.<p>Even for complicated things like PDE simulations, what you really do is approximate some infinite dimensional function space locally with finite dimensional vector spaces. The state space in each step of the simulation is some tensor product. So while a computer certainly allows you to do it, it isn&#x27;t really natural to constantly copy state in such simulations. Abstractly a Fortran 77 program could probably described by a collection of morphisms in some traced monoidal category, so it doesn&#x27;t seem too far off from the mathematics it was invented to implement, although ultimately it clearly is deficient.<p>From a certain angle a lot of abstract algebra is actually more or less about creative destruction of information, certainly if you use it as a tool to study number theory, or topology. A whole class of functors there are monoidal functors from cartesian to non-cartesian categories and you carefully adjust how much information the functor loses in order to make computations feasible (Homology vs. Homotopy for example). The reason mutation doesn&#x27;t seem to be prevalent, is because a lot of operations that are studied are invertible. But as soon as you for example study a group operation on a space, that is not faithful, then you won&#x27;t be able to recover the original space after you&#x27;ve applied the group operation once, unless you&#x27;ve copied it before.<p>The connection between entropy and copying is fairly well explained in this paper I stumbled upon a while ago: \n<a href=""http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ThermoGC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ThermoGC.html</a><p>Of course the origins of copying in type theory is that for example Gentzen&#x27;s calculus can be properly thought of as living in some cartesian closed category, as you probably know. Personally I find linear logic interesting, especially because it is able to faithfully embed intuitionistic logic and lets you talk precisely about copying. The problem is of course that type inference is undecidable for linear type theory, if I remember correctly.<p>In terms of expressive power Haskell is probably already fairly close to the ideal, most relevant to the discussions is I believe its inability to express laws its type classes have.<p>It is fairly good at expressing &quot;free&quot; or &quot;cofree&quot; things, but is not so good at expressing laws statically, not to mention providing a mechanism for proving the laws for instances. The best thing you can do is write embedded interpreters or compilers for those free / cofree things, that sort out things at runtime, or use template haskell.",1423550615

Training DNNs requires a lot of knowledge about DNNs, but not nearly as much knowledge about speech. Knowledge of how to train DNNs is highly transferable between domains like speech and vision. Similarly, the actual code can be mostly shared as well; something like Theano would be just as suited to running speech nets as vision nets.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re quite there yet, but DNNs have the potential to replace every piece of the speech pipeline with one single net that gets audio samples on one side and spits out characters on the other. All those acronyms you mentioned (with many, many PhD theses behind them) will be irrelevant, in the same way that tons of previously successful specialized computer vision feature detectors (HoG, SIFT, SURF, etc) are now irrelevant to the state of the art in object recognition.",1423550570

[1]<p>&#x27;What Wolf slowly realized was that the secret of Roseto wasn&#x27;t diet or exercise or genes or the region where Roseto was situated. It had to be the Roseto itself. As Bruhn and Wolf walked around the town, they began to realize why. They looked at how the Rosetans visited each other, stopping to chat with each other in Italian on the street, or cooking for each other in their backyards. They learned about the extended family clans that underlay the town&#x27;s social structure. They saw how many homes had three generations living under one roof, and how much respect grandparents commanded. They went to Mass at Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church and saw the unifying and calming effect of the church. They counted twenty-two separate civic organizations in a town of just under 2000 people. They picked up on the particular egalitarian ethos of the town, that discouraged the wealthy from flaunting their success and helped the unsuccessful obscure their failures.<p>In transplanting the paesani culture of southern Italy to the hills of eastern Pennsylvania the Rosetans had created a powerful, protective social structure capable of insulating them from the pressures of the modern world. The Rosetans were healthy because of where they were from, because of the world they had created for themselves in their tiny little town in the hills.<p>&quot;I remember going to Roseto for the first time, and you&#x27;d see three generational family meals, all the bakeries, the people walking up and down the street, sitting on their porches talking to each other, the blouse mills where the women worked during the day, while the men worked in the slate quarries,&quot; Bruhn said. &quot;It was magical.&quot;&#x27;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/books/chapters/chapter-outliers.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/books/chapters/chapter-out...</a>",1423550437

It&#x27;s merely a notation, not an actual step by step operation. Unlike a traditional imperative language&#x27;s variable, <i>i</i>&#x27;s value cannot be changed.

Even simpler take two arbitrary numbers multiply them, unless they were prime you have no way of telling from the product what the two original numbers were. In other words multiplication destroys information.<p>In the case of numbers this is fine because there is in fact a way of copying them beforehand by an operation Delta : A -> A x A, which sends a number a to (a,a), so if given (a,b) you want both their product and the numbers themselves, you need a map A x A -> A x A x A given by (for example)<p>(id x M x id) .

They effectively say &quot;this may or may not mutate. See for yourself. Oops! It just mutated. Sorry!&quot;<p>Also, isn&#x27;t what you talk about in your example just a shorthand to avoid cluttering a proof or whatever? It&#x27;s not that variables mutate; it&#x27;s that by convention you elide the notation that shows they mutate. That makes a lot of sense: the writer and the reader assume some things and go on with a compact notation that eliminates noise. It&#x27;s a useful convention, and if the reader loses track of the notation, the worst that can happen is that he/she won&#x27;t be able to understand the proof.<p>The problem with computer programs is that it&#x27;s about both the reader and the computer interpreting the program. Because variables may or may not mutate, it&#x27;s harder for the computer to perform some optimizations. Because of the same reason, it&#x27;s harder for humans to understand the code (&quot;is this going to use the convention that it won&#x27;t mutate variables? I have to carefully read the code and consider all paths in order to be sure&quot;).<p>In a sense, programming with uncontrolled mutation is like switching the default convention to its most confusing setting :)",1423549668

This was due to the &quot;turbojet-assisted ramjet&quot; design of the  Pratt and Whitney J-58. Ramjets can&#x27;t operate at slow speed therefore it uses a turbojet design to get it going. Then at high speed, the J-58 transitions from a turbojet to a functional ramjet. You can see the transitions here: [1]<p>- The SR-71 was actually preceded by the CIA&#x27;s A-12 OXCART program. The A-12 was slightly smaller, had only 1 pilot and was a bit faster. Since stealth wasn&#x27;t fully understood yet and wasn&#x27;t a primary design parameter, the design thinking at the time was centered around either flying high or flying fast to combat the Soviet Union&#x27;s anti-aircraft systems as well as to intercept bombers. As more and more research went into stealth as well as intercontinental ballistic missiles, the &quot;flying fast&quot; design thinking began to dwindle due to its expensive flight and maintenance costs.<p>This eventually led to the creation of the United States&#x27; nuclear triad: submarines, ICBMs, and strategic bombers: Submarines are the stealthiest of the three and can survive a first strike attack, ICBMs can be launched from a friendly controlled area and are difficult to intercept once launched (especially MIRVs), and strategic bombers such as the B-2 Spirit can be used for a stealthy first or second strike but can be recalled whereas with the other two, once fired there&#x27;s no calling them back.<p>- The SR-71 was designed completely using only slide rules and paper.

How can you actually tell a password is strong or not or whether a password is known to attacker or not if you can ask (I was thinking along the line of private information retrieval) privately and get a probability rather than a yes/no based on all the known stolen credential out in the Internet (there are many Gbs files you can download)...",1423548862

There&#x27;s going to be other stuff that systemd will break, but in the long run you&#x27;re better off using the upstream-recommended configuration.<p>That aside... I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that modern Linux is not losing its way. If you go back even five years, and complain that your latest pre-release version of Debian won&#x27;t suspend properly because it needs a password, you&#x27;ll get laughed at by all the people who try to suspend their laptop and have it crash in some way or another.<p>We&#x27;re now in the uncanny valley of software progress. If suspend weren&#x27;t working, you&#x27;d feel hardcore and learn it and deal with it. If it worked perfectly, then you wouldn&#x27;t think about it. (What was the last time you thought about how OS X or Windows does suspend, or handles permissions on mounted drives, or whatever? When was the last time you read a manpage about launchd or one of its helpers? Hint, the manpages are useless.) If it has almost all the complexity to work perfectly, you get neither of these benefits.<p>But it would help things immensely if someone were to document all this, from a busy sysadmin&#x27;s perspective, not from an upstream developer&#x27;s. There are occasionally manpages, but they&#x27;re written like git&#x27;s. Lennart&#x27;s &quot;systemd for administrators&quot; series is a start, but that&#x27;s more of a pitch for why you should want to build your new systems on it, and it only covers systemd. Docs on how to figure things out when they go wrong would be most useful.",1423548445

I&#x27;m not a greybeard by any reasonable measure, having started using Slackware in &#x27;99-&#x27;00, quickly switched to Debian, and never looked back.<p>I think it all stems from D-Bus, which has become the primary mechanism of command and control on desktop Linux. To address the OP&#x27;s initial issue of user mounting disks, it&#x27;s managed via Udisks, which is mostly accessible via D-Bus.<p>I have trouble reconciling Unix&#x27;s notion of &quot;everything is a file&quot; and how a modern Linux desktop operates via D-Bus. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think D-Bus very powerful and flexible. I just wish it was easier to explore and test via file-based tools. Maybe a FUSE layer?<p>Anyhow, if the OP thinks that Linux was once &quot;clean, logical, well put-together, and organized&quot;, I can only laugh at his rose-colored glasses. Linux is and always was a cobbled-together mess of orthogonal paradigms (no better illustrated than by the design philosophy clash of XWindows vs Unix). Maybe earlier Linux was simpler because it was still playing catch-up with other Unix clones out there. Nowadays it&#x27;s leading the pack in innovation, and so things are changing, and fast. I don&#x27;t know if documentation really is worse now that it used to be, I&#x27;m afraid to fall in the same nostalgia fallacy.<p>Ultimately, I see this rant as nothing other than &quot;things are different now and I&#x27;m scared and confused&quot;.

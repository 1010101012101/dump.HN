The change has rather been that instead of a town or a village knowing through the grapevine what&#x27;s going on, it is a central authority who is collecting all the information, with all the attendant power that having such information affords.<p>The problem is thus not a lack of privacy and anonymity -- we have more of it than we ever did.

IllumOS, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, to take some common examples, have each taken different paths in different functional areas, and rarely is one objectively worse than any other unless you have the constraint of a particular set of hardware to run the kernel on and/or software to run under the kernel.<p>Filesystems, for instance.  ZFS and Btrfs (to a lesser extent, mainly because it&#x27;s years from being feature complete) are innovative compared to earlier mainstream filesystems.  Yet, a typical desktop user would not notice any innovation.  Typical users are not concerned with snapshots, sending snapshot diffs between devices, or scrubbing a raid array for errors.  ZFS has been criticized for being a resource hog, and both have been criticized for being slow.  There are always trade offs.  Getting a modern filesystem with COW and block checksums or hashes has performance costs, particularly on rotating disks.  The only thing a desktop user will notice about a 5 year old computer running linux or BSD with a ZFS or btrfs filesystem is that it&#x27;s slow.  Slowness isn&#x27;t innovative, right?",1373939364

6049598,comment,6047182,6048932,2,0,sparkie,,,"There are legitimate reason to use create-set-call: for example, whenever you need polymorphism on object construction - ie, you&#x27;re constructing a yet unknown type which implements an interface or extends a class.<p>C# doesn&#x27;t allow you to specify in an interface or abstract class the parameters that a constructor must take: which makes it very difficult to use such classes as generic type arguments for instance. There&#x27;s a new() constraint which allows you to call a parameterless constructor, and if you also constrain the generic type argument to some interface, you can set the data you want through it.<p>If you expect parameters in the constructor though, you can&#x27;t simply create a new object of the type passed as a generic argument. You must use reflection (Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(T) ...), assuming that there exists a constructor for the yet unknown type (obviously not statically checkable). To prove such a constructor exists at runtime, you can use typeof(T).GetConstructors(), and search through the returned collection for a ConstructorInfo with matching arguments. If you get this far, you&#x27;ll probably drop the idea and resort to the create-set-call mess instead.<p>I suppose a way of fixing this would be to introduce some kind of &quot;constructor pattern&quot; into interfaces and non-sealed classes, requiring subclasses to implement it and allowing the use of said constructor pattern as a generic type argument constraint.<p>Another time you might need create-set-call is if constructing objects which have a mutual reference to eachother. [ var a = new A(); var b = new B(a); a.setB(b); ] cannot be expressed with parameters in both ctors. This might seem like a &quot;bad idea&quot; due to the circular reference, but it&#x27;s more common than you&#x27;d think, and doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean bad code.",1373939230

Essentialists who hold traditional/conservative views don&#x27;t really go much beyond that -- bearing and raising children is what women are for. Essentialists who hold progressive/liberal views try to hide this, but are still basically assuming that all women <i>really</i> want, deep-down inside, to be mothers above all other goals, so the discourse is all about how to do other things at the same time as that.<p>And that&#x27;s a problem regardless of who&#x27;s doing it or why. A developed civilization can remain viable without needing every woman to be a baby factory first and foremost, so why do we still push that attitude from basically all sides?<p>And although there probably always will be some life paths that are incompatible with having children, most of the ones that are incompatible today are not <i>necessarily</i> incompatible; they&#x27;re only contingently incompatible as a consequence of how our society is structured (with its focus on career advancement and measuring one&#x27;s worth in terms of titles and raw dollar values, and the resulting need to work insane hours). We <i>could</i> tear down all those assumptions, and have a society where everyone has the option of multiple ways to lead a fulfilling life, with raising children being one of those.

Except, there are the following practical problems:<p><pre><code>   - Need proper escaping\n\n      + Lots of old languages do not support C style of escape sequences.\n\n      + Depending on languages, you need to escape interpolations.\n\n   - Cobol and Fortran programs have troublesome constraints\n\n      + Need 7 spaces on the left and less than 80 columns per line, etc.\n\n   - Naive escaping will cause intermediate files to get too large.\n\n      + JVM Strings have 64K size limit.\n\n      + Languages like Intercal and Whitespace will become unbearably slow.\n</code></pre>\nIn order to avoid these, Perl requires something like ppencode, Java needs LZW compression to avoid string size limits.  Cobol&#x27;s line length limit was satisfied using Closure generator, Fortran&#x27;s line length limit was satisfied using Coffeescript generator.  People who are interested should see the generated code.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>In general, there isn&#x27;t any standard method to making quines.  You just keep on tweaking the code until the input and output matches, mostly by trial and error.",1373936915

The generic, functional map function cannot be written, and never will.<p>There is an issue of elegance. If generics were to be added, lists and maps would need to have similar syntax, because they feel and behave like generics. However, they cannot. Their syntax is not generic enough.<p>Oddly enough, elegance through consistency was never reached when designing built-in functions like make(): those can be applied on any type, but user-defined functions don&#x27;t have this freedom. Essentially, there is a Java-like divide between built-in types (which, for instance, you cannot create methods on) and user types. Their rules of elegance don&#x27;t apply to the built-ins, which is quite odd.<p>I doubt that this impedes on programming efficiency compared to C.

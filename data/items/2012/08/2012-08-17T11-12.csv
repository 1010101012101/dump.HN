Agreed, this isn't very useful, but the list isn't protected/obscured if the URLs are that easy to guess.<p>For example, at Amazon Universal Wishlist, the ID of a valid wishlist is very hard to guess -- like 6HV8XSTGDT3E7-difficult.

4395927,comment,4393756,4393756,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"As akeefer pointed out, this was a long rant which finally got to the point: separate effort and scheduling. Take a quick chop at estimating effort, but not in terms of duration/dates on a schedule. Relative size works fine. It's better to take a quick hit at estimation over and over again as you begin to see empirical results than it is to spend a lot of time up-front trying to do the perfect estimate.<p>Software management is not like programming. It's also not like other kinds of management. Any group of people needs some sort of management function. The trick is to put in the most lightweight structure possible. For some reason many technical people of great intelligence, when faced with planning activities, begin to construct various kinds of paper and mathematical wonderlands to live in. We naturally enjoy creating complex models.<p>Don't do that.",1345204685

From a business standpoint, if Facebook (or any other API company) sees massive growth/activity in an application on its platform, you better believe they are going to take notice and have some course of action.<p>You can even throw LinkedIn into this group (<a href=""http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/06/21/linkedin-shuts-down-headhunting-app-how-open-is-open/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/06/21/linkedin-shuts-do...</a>).<p>The main aggravation/issue stems from developers wanting to use these APIs to gain access to users without fully <i>qualifying</i> the risks. I could easily be building a fantasy sports app on Facebook thinking, ""they won't EVER get into this market. They have much bigger problems to solve."" 2 years later, they get into the space and shut me down because I am a competitor.<p>These ""wannabe collaborators"" are not trying to improve the experience on said platform. They are trying to gain access to a vast database of users with low barriers of entry and an easy to use(/abuse) marketing channels. It's unfortunate that no one has the foresight into understanding where a company as large as Facebook/LinkedIn/etc may pivot into, but only insiders really have first hand knowledge of this sort of thing.",1345204670

No range types, etc.<p>Where range types are handy (and why I am looking forward to them in 9.2) is where you have to deal with things like a financial transaction that should be amortized over a period of time.  This would allow you to adjust the transaction incrementally as a reporting, rather than an accounting, function.  But I wouldn't use them for cases where you don't want overlaps or gaps.  The best thing there is to just put in floor values and select the next highest floor.<p>There you go.  Again order by and limit/offset do pretty much what you want without doing crazy inline views like you are doing in your example.  BTW, I see inline views as an antipattern in SQL best avoided if you can.<p><i>nested columns just means what it sounds like: that you can put anything in a cell (including lists, tables, lists of tables, lists of lists of lists of tables).</i><p>PostgreSQL supports this btw although back in 7.3 or so if I remember, I found that tables with tuples in columns were write-only but that was fixed pretty quickly (first with a ""don't do that"" check and then with a real fix).<p>The point of CTE's is to give you a stable intermediate result set.",1345201219

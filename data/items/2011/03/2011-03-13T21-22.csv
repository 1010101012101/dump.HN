That is, the article flatly stated that:<p>""It is the manner in which ideas are
executed that counts.""<p>So, the execution ""counts"".  So, he is saying that the ideas don't ""count"".  That is, what he was saying is usually interpreted as 'execution is ALL that counts'.<p>The quote you extracted is even self-contradictory:  In his first sentence he says that ideas are not ""enough"" so admits that they are necessary but in his second sentence is back to saying that it is the 'execution' that ""counts"" essentially saying that the ideas are not even necessary.<p>He's just spinning nasty stuff, and trying to write in ways that are slightly difficult to debunk.<p>But his point is quite clear:  He believes that ideas are worthless, that execution is everything, that is, all that ""counts"".<p>Worst of all, he omits any concept that there can be bad ideas and good ideas.<p>Basically he wants to run down ideas.<p>As I explain, and as in the link I gave, this running down ideas is common in business.<p>My point about ""equivalent"" is a reasonable implication to draw since to him execution ""counts"" and, thus, ideas don't and, thus, are equivalent.",1300053329

2320321,comment,2319808,2319808,0,0,reduxredacted,,,"I was pleasantly surprised by this particular entry (at least the currently held top responder, the 5' tall guy).<p>I saw one element that struck home with me:<p><i>I also get to hear female friends go on about what jerks all men are, how they cheat, aren't trustworthy, etc</i><p>It stood because I learned the hard way that when you are <i>that guy</i> you're <i>the brother she never had</i> or (put in the ""Friend Zone"" [hat top to the movie ""Just Friends""]).  The problem is that excessive assertiveness by people of limited height tends to come off as ""Napoleon Syndrome"" (<i>HNers</i> know Napoleon wasn't actually short, but I'm guessing my point was made properly (-:).<p>HN tends toward problem solving, and I had the confidence problem, myself.  I am not short, but I am probably in the bottom 25% of the ""attractive scale"".  I'm a very skinny, non-muscularly developed male.  I have an egg shaped head and various other features that my bride (of 7 years, who happens to be a three inches short of 5', likes to joke about).  I was terrified of rejection from women because I had been rejected a few times previously and ... really, it sucks.<p>I can't take credit for all of this because I had read something ""way back when"" that led me to this plan.  I did it.  It worked <i>for me</i>.<p>First, I wrote out the plan.  This was important because it reinforced that I was solving a problem in a non-personal nature (think serial killer saying ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again"").  At least once per day (ultimately turned into several times in a two day span), I would subject myself to female rejection in every way, and <i>I would accept it graciously</i>.<p>I had been juggling one ""friend I had hoped would be my girlfriend"" and it wasn't working out, so I started there.  I explained that I had feelings for her in clear language (I believe the words were ""I've been hanging around with you as a friend in hopes that you would date me"").  I apologized for not making that clear in the first place (the whole <i>graciously</i> part kicks in.  This was, in my mind, a lie).  I got rejected.  We also ceased to be friends.  In the long run, it was a good decision.<p>Baby steps: I went to <i>the bar</i> (really, <i>a club</i>).  I used to triumphantly say that I'd never want to have met my wife in a bar.  This was a cop-out, and I found <i>clubbing</i> to be a great sandbox environment for this reason (I don't ""want"" to meet my wife in a bar, so if they reject me, it's all a big experiment).  I don't dance, not even now.  I went there with one of my friends (significantly more attractive, despite being as skinny).  He actually took home one of the girls who had rejected me (really badly, with the whole ""how dare you hit on me <i>at a bar</i> on <i>ladies night</i> when I got <i>half-off drinks and no cover charge</i> and you had to <i>pay</i> for the privilege of me <i>berating you</i> [yes, still a little bitter about that]).  I struck out -- continuously -- mercilessly -- and the first several times it was <i>seriously</i> one of the biggest ego-killers I'd experienced (though, the amount of concentration it took to keep a cool head actually softened the blow for me).<p>There were, however, the few <i>wins</i>.  I got a couple of good dates out of women I met at <i>the club</i> (no real connections).  I was (naively) surprised to find that there are women at clubs who are there because they can't find another socially acceptable place to be ""picked up"" (look for the ones who aren't drinking very much and lack the ring or the arm-attached boyfriend).<p>The practical upshot of all of this was the usual story of how to gain a life skill (confidence, not womanizing).  It was highly awkward, painful and resulted in a lot of failure.  But I'm happily married going on 8 years as a result of it.  And the experience increased confidence in communicating with others across the board.<p>EDIT: phrasing wasn't ideal.",1300052386

2320319,comment,2317359,2318839,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think you're missing the point of something like SHA1_pass: A different passphrase for every site. In the case of SuperGenPass, it hashes the site with the passphrase, making a unique passphrase for every domain. In the case of SHA1_pass, I would do something like, ""My wacky passphrase 123 facebook.com"" and ""My wacky passphrase 123 google.com"", etc. if I were to use it.<p>The sentence is only a piece of the hashed value, while some unique thing about what you're logging into is the rest of it. So, using ""My wacky passphrase 123 facebook.com"" as my password directly on facebook.com would mean that anyone with malicious intent and access to facebook.com code could easily figure out that every website where I have an account is ""My wacky passphrase 123 sitename.tld"". Strong password failure. The one-way hashed version of that has no meaning to the sites I log in to.<p>So, original sentence has very low security value, while a hashed version of it (assuming a unique piece for every site or service) has very high security value, even if the actual password generated is less strong than the original sentence from a purely ""number of possibilities"" perspective.<p>Of course, if you always use the exact same passphrase, and thus the same resulting password, your math would make sense...but the likelihood of an exploit is far more likely to come from people behind one of the sites you use sniffing your password, than from a brute force attack, in either case.",1300052363

On the implementation side, their previous offerings have not been compelling. On the brand side, people generally aren't eager to see Google's reach over their personal lives extended. That is, even if the implementation were compelling, the prospect of Big Google getting bigger, at least in the arena of gathering personal information, appeals to no one outside of Google. This parallels the growth of Microsoft's negative brand equity a decade and a half earlier. No one wanted to see a bigger Microsoft. The privacy guarantees alluded to in the original article make it clear that Google is intent on addressing both issues, yet I remain skeptical.

It also lets you reuse what you might already have, which might allow you to (covertly?) transition languages.  I use it regularly.<p>If you're not already entrenched in the Java world, you probably don't need it.  I use it because my clients are comfortable deploying WARs, EARs, JARs, SARs, etc.  Oracle and IBM sell a full stack, so there's never any scrutiny.<p>Technologically, you might want it. Despite the tendency to ignore them, Java has a lot of superior tech that comes in handy.  You'll get real threads, connection pooling, distributed transactions, fantastic async I/O libraries; Jython inherits all of this.  If you need this, it's available.  You don't have to roll your own.  (You will have to learn it, though, and I think that's what <i>really</i> drives NIHS...)  Understand that Jython does come with a performance penalty on some tasks, but pays dividends on others.  You can also spot tune with pure Java to some extent.<p>So it's really a strategic thing.  If you're selling into orgs that have established practices, or if you need really serious throughput, Jython will probably be a good choice.  If you're building a web app that you run on your own infrastructure and you've already chosen Python and Django, you're probably better off without the extra layer.",1300051014

Similarly for Einstein's equivalence of mass and energy in E = mc^2 -- doesn't ""count"".<p>For the Craig Venter idea of chopping up DNA, sequencing the pieces, and reassembling the pieces in a computer, an idea that got the sequencing of DNA done years faster, we should have ignored that.<p>For the idea of Reed-Solomon error correcting codes crucial to letting CDs work, it doesn't ""count"" either.<p>For public key cryptosystems, their role in Kerberos and authentication and in electronic finance, we should forget about that, too, since they are just ideas which don't ""count"".<p>People should quit looking for an idea to settle the question P versus NP since the idea, even if found, would not ""count"".<p>And the idea of using tungsten in a glass with high vacuum as an incandescent electric light would not ""count"".  The tungsten idea came from the English chemist Swan, and the needed much better vacuum pump came from Germany(?).  Then Edison could give up on baking hair to make carbon filaments and get on with electric lighting.<p>But, more is claimed:  Apparently all ideas are equivalent, that is. don't ""count:, and only execution counts.  So, might as well start with a bad idea.<p>If start with a bad idea, then, yes, execution is about all that will ""count"".  Just what is it about bad ideas the author likes so much?<p>This article is just another attempt of many to run down ideas by apparently someone with less than a weak little hollow hint of a tiny clue about what an 'idea' really is and what a good idea is how valuable it can be.<p>In fact, with a good idea, execution is routine and the idea was likely difficult to find and is about all that does ""count"".<p>There can be reasons for running down good ideas:<p>(1) They can be new and disrupt things.<p>(2) They tend to be difficult to find.<p>(3) In school in, say, math and physics, being able to find the good ideas needed to work the problems can be difficult and hurt the feelings of people who fail to find such ideas.<p>(4) In venture capital, it might be a good initial negotiating position to claim that ""Ideas are easy.  Execution is everything."" and ""Ideas are plentiful."" in order to tell an entrepreneur with a good idea that what he has is easy and plentiful and nothing.<p>E.g., one of the most important steps forward in civilization, technology, and economic productivity was Euclid's 'Elements' on plane geometry, especially the Pythagorean theorem, e.g., crucial for trigonometry, Fourier theory, Nyquist sampling, JPGs, MPEGs, and music CDs!

2320231,comment,2319983,2319983,0,0,bluehat,,,"The article doesn't go far enough: the iPad is the temporary hack bridge between technologies. The major function of the iPad I have seen among people who are not making hardware accessories has been as a social bridge so they can get work done in a place/time when pulling out a whole laptop would be weird, awkward or rude. For example: if you're having a lunch meeting and the other person is late, pulling out a whole laptop rubs in how late they were because you had time to ""set up and settle into a device"" instead of ""messing about on your iPad"" which is socially closer to messing about on your phone, and we hold no stigma against for a waiting person.<p>Having a sister 10 years younger than me (14) has taught me that younger generations are not use to our protocols and therefore hold no squeamishness about breaking the conventions of them.  For example, if you have her (or her peer's) attention you know this because she has removed one phone(MP3 player) earbud to listen to you. She doesn't see continuing to use the technology as a potential distraction/rudeness, and in many senses resents the older generations (teachers/parents) for demanding her absolute attention for every trivial thing.<p>The iPad is our bridge from dropping in and out of the internet in the real world all the time, because a full drop is seen as rude, but her generation won't really care about that. They'll just drop in and out as they please, which is why I suspect that they'll have little use for the iPad, except as the training bridge for dinosaurs like us.",1300050397

The security professional:  I need to do a security risk assessment to comply with policy or regulation (e.g. FFIEC). The organization has no risk assessment methodology and I am going to get buried in Excel.
The pen tester: I need to explain the business impact of the technical vulnerabilities I have found.
The cloud vendor: I need to pass a customer security review to get their business.
The small business: I need a risk assessment process to comply with PCI-DSS: Includes an annual process: “12.1.2 identifies threats, and vulnerabilities, and results in a formal risk assessment”.<p>How are customers solving the problem today?
The security professional:  Write a new methodology based on OCTAVE, OWASP, ISO27005 etc. Develop a complicated set of spreadsheets.
The pen tester: Use a simple high, medium, low risk rating or let the customer security department explain the risk to the business.
The cloud vendor: Complete a spreadsheet and provide the same information in so many slightly different forms for every customer. 
The small business: hire a contractor or consultant.<p>How are the current solutions deficient? 
The security professional:  Re-inventing the wheel in every company. Spreadsheets are hard to manage, have no version control and are hard to collaborate on.  Current security risk assessment tools are difficult to use and tailored for operational or enterprise risk rather than security risk.
The pen tester: Not actually rating the risk to the. business, passes the buck to the internal security team and reduces the chance of getting more business.
The cloud vendor: Takes time and man power, treated as a compliance exercise, does not convince the customer their risks are mitigated and therefore loses the business.
The small business: expensive.<p>Can you provide a solution to this problem that is a ‘need to have’ vs a nice to have?
The security professional:  Software as a service, no need to re-invent a methodology, easy to use, share and report on
The pen tester: Simple web or mobile based way to turn technical security vulnerabilities to business risks. Enables focus on core competency (breaking things) while speaking the business language and winning more work.
The cloud vendor: Assess the risks once. Easily adjust for each customer. Shows the customer how their risks are mitigated rather than filling in a compliance list. Saves time and money.
The small business: Simple process that can cut down consulting costs eventually eliminating them while still meeting the regulatory requirement.<p>Application in beta: link in first comment<p>Would really appreciate any thoughts and feedback",1300050336

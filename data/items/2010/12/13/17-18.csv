Unfortunately it is because this post received considerably more attention than I originally expected and the API usage limits of 2000 requests per hour have been reached.<p>Edit: The service is back now. I'm working on a better caching solution to lower the number of hits on the API.<p>Edit #2: Okay, I have a more permanent solution. Bookflavor now serializes and caches API responses locally, then hits the cache and unserializes them if possible rather than hitting the Amazon API. Hopefully it won't exceed the limits this hour.

2001327,comment,1999935,2000012,0,0,jerf,,,"There seems to me to be a missing step there; I don't get how mirror bacteria somehow automatically hoover up all the resources. They'd be in competition with the normal bacteria, and it is not immediately obvious to me why they so automatically win. Because, again, this is a mirror competition, so whatever putative advantage the flipped version has, the normal version has, along with overwhelming starter advantage. It seems to me there's only really two possible resulting outcomes, based on symmetry arguments: The flipped versions still die out, because life favors the already-dominant hand for some reason, or they compete themselves into a 50/50 standoff because the forces don't favor either side once they reach parity. Life favoring the side with the numerical advantage and crushing the other side also happens to explain why we have one-handed life, so arguably it's the dominant hypothesis at the moment, too, though I wouldn't care to bet the fate of the planet on it.<p>Now, the bad thing about the 50/50 case is that it may be a much, much lower-energy biosphere, because now all life has to deal with the existence of proteins it can't do anything with and absolutely nothing is evolved to deal with. Could still be a holocaust of epic proportions with the biosphere not really recovering for several million years and almost all non-directly-photosynthesizing life wiped out by starvation as the biosphere has to rebuild from the bottom. (And by ""biosphere recovering"" I still mean that we're basically wiped back to the Great Oxygenation Event [1] in complexity terms, assuming there's nothing we can do to fix it after the fact.) Could be a disaster, certainly.

I personally think that books are drastically undervalued and that people are not willing to pay enough for good books which has the consequence that they are either served well targeted bestsellers, which can be produced at that price, or junk.

Which makes sense, because Java is a terrible language for teaching fundamentals.<p>And yes, I do think Java is much better than Scheme for the kind of software a bank wants. The rigid syntax, static type system, and built-in OO, and lack of macros make it easily to build very powerful tools, which you need when you're wading through a huge, unfamiliar codebase. These same features make it pretty easy to jump into an arbitrary codeblock and understand what it's doing. Scheme, for example, is so flexible that you can design your own exception-handling and iteration constructs, which nobody but you can read.<p>As far as elegance goes, it counts mostly in the small. Quicksort in Haskell is a thing of beauty but most production code looks nothing like this.

On the other hand, people today have more stuff than they did in the 80's. That suggests the BLS inflation numbers might not mean what you think they mean.<p>(It's actually pretty clear why they don't quite match up if you look closely at the methodology of the BLS. The basket of goods used to compute inflation today is larger than the basket of goods in 1980. A proper measure of inflation would take a fixed basket of goods at t[0] and measure the cost of the <i>same basket</i> of goods at t[1].

Some Europeans don't like to be thrown into the ""Europe"" pot (""but we're so diverse!"") but it seems we're pretty united on this point of entrepreneurial un-culture. All across the continent, business plans, consulting companies, etc. are mistaken for entrepreneurialism. Everywhere I look, governments think the solution is throwing ever more complex grant programmes and sponsored bullshit events at the problem. The established players and the lawyers egg them on of course, as they're only the ones who can afford to benefit from all this stuff.<p>Personally, I think the best thing the government could do is to get the hell out of my face. I'm discriminated against (in Austria) for healthcare compared to the employed and the unemployed. (I have to pay for insurance and social security whether I made any money that quarter or not; I <i>then</i> have to pay 20% of my healthcare bills. Employees pay a percentage of their monthly salary and nothing else; of course they also get paid sick leave) I pay <i>more</i> income tax (employee bonuses are taxed at 6% - my lowest tax rate is 36.5%; it's tradition, and in some cases <i>law</i>, for employees to get 2 months' salary as a bonus). I'm forced into <i>paid</i> membership of useless interest groups which are just extensions of the political parties.<p>Sure, I could try to apply for grants. Except for startups the main expense is the cost of living of founders (most of which turns out to be taxes...). And guess what, that's not considered a valid expense for tax relief. Plus, the grant wouldn't cover the lawyers' fees anyway, let alone the amount of time I'd spend chasing after it.<p>Hiring people is super difficult and <i>very</i> expensive for startups. Most seem to employ their staff as perpetual freelancers because the rules (and taxes) are so arcane. I'd guess that doesn't exactly make them attractive to potential hires, so you're losing out on talent.<p>It's better in the UK to a degree. (shame about the weather...)

Empirical testing of proposed legislation should be implemented as soon as possible.  In controversial cases where experimentation doesn't lead to satisfactory outcomes, thanks to ideological intransigence, the method should be supplemented with a proposal that I call Bimodal Politics.<p>Technology could be used to manage controversial political issues, for which the distribution of voters is bimodal and for which there is essentially no middle ground. Such issues include abortion rights, stem cell research and gay marriage. Through the system of bimodal politics, voters would live in parallel legal and political worlds, with different rights and obligations to the state depending on how they voted.<p>Where controversial legal and political matters are concerned, the distribution of opinion involves roughly equal and opposite numbers of equally-informed, impartial rational voters. (Some would contend that for issues such as abortion, a few vociferous opponents give the misleading impression of a much larger opposition, but until this is established, we will proceed as if public discourse reflects a genuine controversy.)<p>Although the voters on each side of a controversy may not see the other side as rational or equally informed, one essential feature of controversies is that they cannot be decided by common morality, and they have to be transferred to the legal and political system for resolution. The legal and political system can attempt to resolve controversial issues  one way or the other, but it is understood that the resolution is provisional and does not resolve any underlying moral issues.<p>Deciding controversial issues one way or the other is inherently unstable. What if it were possible to decide issues in parallel, in such a way that each group in a controversial issue imposes rights and obligations only upon itself and no group imposes its vote on the members of the other group? Is there a procedure that would result in less political and social instability than deciding one way or the other for all voters?<p>Bimodal politics attempts to provide a legal and political mechanism for resolving politically controversial issues, with the understanding that it provides a political decision procedure: it does not address the underlying moral issues. In outline, a database is maintained of voter preference on controversial issues that are designated bimodal issues. Your vote is recorded by the bimodal voter database. Your vote determines your rights and obligations to the state on that particular issue in parallel with those voters who voted oppositely, and who may have (and probably have) different rights and obligations under the state.<p>Consider stem cell research. Under the proposed system, stem cell research would be designated a bimodal issue. During an election, your vote on stem cell research would be entered into the database. If you voted in favor of stem cell research, you may be taxed to support it, your embryos may be harvested for stem cells (these may be from embryos slated for destruction in any case) and if you develop a disease that requires stem cell derived therapy for its treatment, you will be eligible for it.<p>If you voted against stem cell research, you will not be taxed to support it, your embryos will not be harvested for stem cells and if you develop a disease you will be prohibited from pursuing treatments derived from stem cell research.<p>Abortion is another issue that would be designated a bimodal issue under the system of bimodal politics. If you vote against abortion, your tax dollars will not be used to support state-sponsored family planning programs or sex education, and  you will be legally barred from having an abortion if you are female. If you are male and you impregnate a woman who has an abortion, and you voted against abortion, you will be held legally liable.<p>In either case, if you voted against abortion and your fetus or your partner’s fetus is aborted, you will be prosecuted by the state.  However, if you voted in favor of abortion, your fetus can be aborted, and your tax dollars may go to support state-sponsored family planning programs and sex education.<p>These examples illustrate the slogan that under bimodal politics, you live in the world you voted for.",1292261101

If you do a query that retrieves multiple records, for example<p><pre><code>  SELECT * FROM test1 WHERE id > constant;\n</code></pre>\n...then that translates very nicely into a bulk read from the underlying datastore.<p>Contrast that with a secondary index, where each leaf node essentially contains the physical address of the record, so for each record you're returning, you have to make an additional random seek to the underlying datastore to get the entire record. This is why primary indexes are faster than secondary indexes, in general. Various caching schemes smooth out the difference though.<p>Another good tip to keep in mind when writing indexes is that you can have covering indexes. If you often do a query of the type<p><pre><code>  SELECT a, b FROM table WHERE c = ... AND d > ... ORDER BY e, f\n</code></pre>\nIf you then have an index over (c,d,e,f,a,b), that index can cover the entire query, i.e. you can return the records by just looking at the index, you don't need to fetch the actual records.",1292261083

The problem with this argument is that it conflates ""population segment"" with ""particular individuals.""  You see that the top one percent get a larger share and conclude that the rich keep getting richer while everyone else gets poorer.  If those population segments were static, this would be true.  In reality, these groups are very dynamic and people move between them throughout their lives, so when you look at ""the bottom twenty percent"" over a multi-decade period, you're not looking at a fifth of the population permanently trapped at the bottom of the totem pole, you're looking at many different people starting out in that position before moving up.  Certainly some of them are stuck there, but most of them aren't.  The top 1% is extremely volatile: I don't have any statistics handy but I have read more than once that the percentage of the top 1% who were up there ten years prior has fallen dramatically since the '70s.  It's not the same people getting richer, it's new people (who used to be well below that top tier) getting even richer than the last set of top earners.<p>As an example, consider a typical middle-class American family: they start out as two individuals fresh out of college each earning thirty or forty thousand dollars a year: nowhere near the top 1%.  As they gain experience they begin to earn more and more each year, moving up into higher earning segments.  At some point they meet each other and get married, dramatically increasing their ""household"" income (and creating difficulties for economists trying to make apples-to-apples comparisons).  In their fifties they hit their peak earning years and spend half a decade or so in the highest tax bracket: not in the top 1% of earners, but probably in the top 10% or some other arbitrary slice frequently villified as earning more than their ""fare share"" of income.  Then their income tapers off as they transition into retirement and they fall back into the next quintile down, maybe even two quintiles down.  For their entire working lives prior to retirement they saw their income grow steadily, but by taking a snapshot of their income when they were twenty-five and comparing it to the income of twenty-five year-olds from three decades earlier you come to the conclusion that ""people"" are earning less than they used to.  I'd like to see some statistics on lifetime real compensation (not just income, but ALL compensation).  I'd be willing to bet that it would show that the middle class has done quite well by themselves in the last three decades.",1292260552

Or that your reaction is common among veterans.  But even if 9 out of 20 veterans are not bothered by the thank you, the pain caused to the remaining ones is bad enough that I think it unwise for people to randomly thank veterans they don't know.",1292259856

2001073,comment,2000833,2000833,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Really pointless. I posted this to the site:<p><i><em>The password is automatically salted with the domain and username</em><p>...which is exactly as secure as Gawker.com themselves doing a salt+hash.<p>Let's for a minute assume what you're proposing is what's being done. Gawker has been attacked. The hacker has the columns ""password"" and ""username"". Hacker knows the domain name. You're exactly where you left off!<p>Even if the password has been again hashed and salted on the server - that's just an extra round of cracking (or, more realistically, rainbow-table matching).<p>What you _should_ be doing is using a single, trusted and very much secure password provider (a la OpenID). Hacker attacks your site, gains nothing. And if you must do the authentication yourself, or the nature of your userbase prevents you from outsourcing the authentication (perhaps <em>you</em> are the OpenID provider we're talking about earlier), you need to be using something more complex than a silly MDx or even SHAx to do the hash - these are made for boiling down huge amounts of data into a small field of not more than ~256-4096 bytes - which is NOT what you want. Look at bcrypt - it's DESIGNED for this. It's a solution waiting for more and more attacks like Gawker.com so lazy and incompetent developers worldwide will use this existing, plug-and-play, simple, direct, and safe alternative to what they're currently doing.</i><p>EDIT<p>Regarding rainbow tables - I'm predicting that with todays resources and cloud super-computing, etc. (just look at the new EC2 GPU instances!) we're going to see a new type of rainbow tables that actually precompute the hashes for different salts as well. It's an order of magnitude larger data and more computation than last generations rainbow tables, but todays tech is more than an order of magnitude more available.",1292259793

Anything more difficult than that then they are likely to forget their password.<p>Another awful idea is locking people out if the password is wrong after 3 attempts.  Then you have mischievous characters entering in 3 bogus passwords just to lock you out of your account and inconvenience you.<p>The whole concept of expiring passwords should be gotten rid of everywhere.",1292259606

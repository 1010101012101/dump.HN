Especially when it comes to entire albums.<p>The less time you give to people to think about it, by lowering the price, the more you reduce the chance of them going, ""Well, this album is $10, $12, $15.. but I have to buy x, y, and z this month, I guess I'll wait for now, or download it instead"" and instead, have them go, ""Well, it's almost no money. <i>click</i>"".",1224575240

I can definitely see a use for dtrace for gathering metrics and mining data that it isn't worth the application provider building in, or digging into software that you can't get the source for (traditionally much less of an issue on Linux than on Solaris).  But listing the queries that are being sent through your mysql instance is a feature that not only should exist as part of the base mysql feature set, it already does.<p>This example is in the same class as using Fibonacci as a good example of recursion.",1224573505

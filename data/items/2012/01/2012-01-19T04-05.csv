Probably not, it is full of people like us would are making things and doing things and building careers, and a lot of them are probably also concerned about thxe future of the Internet with SOPA.

3483240,comment,3481140,3482923,1,0,maratd,,,"> Is it mainly because of the HTTP request overhead?<p>Aside from the overhead you and others mention, there is a bigger problem. For most server-side languages, once a request is initiated, it is very difficult to feed new data into that request and make it perform additional functions. Most requests get their input data from GET or POST. What if an external server outside of the one that is handling the request needs to contact one of the clients?<p>Using long polling/SSE, you essentially have to have the thread/process handling the request also poll any external sources for information for any potential events that might need to be triggered. This turns into a huge mess very quickly. Especially since each polling/SSE request thread/process is isolated from the rest, forcing you to do really funky stuff to coordinate everything.<p>This isn't as much of a problem with web sockets. Your web socket server has access to all of the connected clients and you can create a web socket interface in any external servers to allow them to talk directly to the proper clients. It's cleaner.<p>Web sockets isn't perfect. I had to implement a proper client for web sockets in PHP so that it can talk to my Node.JS websocket server. It was horrible. But it was less horrible than setting all of that up with long polling.",1326948574

This international treaty binds signatory nations to the copyright protections provided in countries where the original art was created. It would apply to both US copyright holders to protect their works abroad and foreign copyright holders where their works are used here.<p>The Wikipedia page on the Berne Convention has some really interesting facts on this treaty and you should read it before voicing opposition to the SCOTUS ruling or claiming ""American Exceptionalism"" is being run over by a truck. This is not a bad ruling and the 6-2 vote suggests 1 judge appointed by a liberal President agrees with the argument. Ne, if you get into the opinion (link below) you'll find that two conservative appointees dissented while the remaining justices agreed (sans Kagan who recused). The point is that this was hardly a ""party line"" or ideological divide.<p>The official opinion here: <a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-545.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-545.pdf</a><p>Some worthy quotations from the Wikipedia page found at: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protec...</a><p><i>Before the Berne Convention, national copyright laws usually only applied for works created within each country. Consequently, a work published in United Kingdom (UK) by a British national would be covered by copyright there, but could be copied and sold by anyone in France. Likewise, a work published in France by a French national could be copyrighted there, but could be copied and sold by anyone in the UK. Dutch publisher Albertus Willem Sijthoff, who rose to prominence in the trade of translated books, wrote to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in 1899 in opposition to the convention over concerns that its international restrictions would stifle the country's print industry.</i><p><i>The United States initially refused to become a party to the Convention, since that would have required major changes in its copyright law, particularly with regard to moral rights, removal of the general requirement for registration of copyright works and elimination of mandatory copyright notice. This led to the Universal Copyright Convention in 1952 to accommodate the wishes of the United States. But on March 1, 1989, the U.S. Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 was enacted, and the United States Senate ratified the treaty, making the U.S. a party to the Berne Convention, and making the Universal Copyright Convention nearly obsolete.</i><p>Editorial. I believe in American exceptionalism on a number of fronts including some trade issues. But, the notion that any individual or group of people from one country can merely disregard the copyrights of and profit from works created in another is ludicrous. I feel bad for the plantiffs -- the orchestra members who brought the suit. They have been treated unfair, not by the SCOTUS, but by a general failure of US enforcement of foreign copyright as provided by the treaty.<p>Just my $0.02",1326948528

So this bill gets killed - big whoopee. There are a dozen more like it waiting to be written. Time will tell if the populace have the staying power - corporations certainly do, and politicians have nothing but.<p>This is a bill that strikes at the best disseminator of information known to man. The only reason it has got so much attention because those that control the Internet (Wikipedia et al.) firstly care enough about this bill, and secondly have a way to communicate with lots of others.<p>This is an improvement over just big media, but only really concerns bills that are Internet related.

Are you inhibiting yourself, judging the worth of your output, shaping your sentences as youre laying them down? Try free-writing: writing anything, as long as it's English (not random letters), not censoring anything, nonsense or sense welcome indifferently. What's the fastest you can write without putting on the brakes to judge? That would be the upper limit of your dexterity.<p>Your gear counts. I remember the IBM Selectric II, the one with the ball. The whirr and strike, the hum of the machine waiting if you paused to ponder, encouraged typing. Most computer keyboards today make an annoying noise, even thought it might be quiet. Hackers and writers will prefer the Das Keyboard (<a href=""http://www.daskeyboard.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daskeyboard.com/</a>). They say the all-black one (nothing printed on the keys, like a piano) trains your brain to touch type like a Pro. I like it mostly because of the feel - the force you need to type an 'a' or a ;  is less than for an f or a j. The Das has a real smooth ride. There's something in that racket that encourages fast typing, like the first few pings of metallic raindrops building to a sustained mechanical storm - all because of your awesome creativity and work ethic. It reminds me of the IBM Selectric II, the one with the metal ball whirring and  striking.<p>Practice is a huge factor in dexterity. I think my typing speed increased linearly from the 40s to the 70-80 wpm range during the four years or so when time I was typing 3,000-10,000 words (10-20) pages every day. It has plateaued there for the last 10 years, because I just don't type as much. The fastest way to write is steno. Plover (<a href=""http://plover.stenoknight.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plover.stenoknight.com/</a>) has been mentioned on HN recently. But practice is the most important - Gladwell's annoying 10,000 hours, yes. The hours. Not only rack em up but practice with your body and soul. What are you writing, anyway? Don't think for a second that Malmsteen played guitar to a metric, so many notes per minute. You gotta have a feel for it. Maybe youre not meant to type fast, eh - maybe the world needs something else out of you?<p>In summary: like what you write, like your gear, and use it intensely. If you don't improve then you might be limited genetically, which doesn't matter. Once the ink dries, nobody knows how long it took you.",1326946815

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by ""no typing system"" so I'll go ahead and assume what you likely meant - no static type system.<p>Optimizing code written in a dynamically typed language is a pretty well understood problem (now) thanks to the SELF research at SUN and more recently the V8 Javascript engine. Both VMs employ type profiling at runtime to figure out what the compiler should assume the type of a dynamically typed variable should be. It can then emit code that treats a variable like it always has the profiled type - like a C++ compiler would. When such an assumption is broken at runtime, implementations typically fallback to an unoptimized version of the code (V8) to execute the rest of the continuation. Well written code is expected to achieve type stability pretty fast making the fallback overhead insignificant.",1326946124

It's too easy sitting back and pooh-poohing every idea, and there are a lot of people that love doing that.  Coming up with solutions is the right way to approach it, because people really don't like hearing ""No"".<p>That being said, I took this approach at one of my previous jobs, a fairly well known enterprise software company in the Valley, and I got blackballed for being too negative.  We were working on a project and there was simply no hope of it ever working.  The technical lead on the project was over-arrogant and under-talented, and essentially built a system that wouldn't scale.  I brought this up a bunch of times, and gave solutions on how to fix it, but they were all rejected by the technical lead.  I was told by my manager that I was being too negative and was given a poor performance review, which really rattled me, so I gave up the ""good fight"".  9 months later, the project was canned because of scalability issues.<p>So this ""Cult of Positive Attitude"" really does exist, can be pervasive in a company to the point of being toxic, and sometimes the best solution is to just leave, which is what I ended up doing.",1367592650

But even 4x slower than asm.js is quite fast, it's enough to run the Epic Citadel demo for example (try it on a version of firefox without those optimizations, like stable release - as others reported in comments, it runs ok). A lot of the work in Epic Citadel is on the GPU anyhow, say it's about half, so the difference is then only something like 2x.<p>2x is not that much, we have similar differences on the web anyhow because of CPU differences, JIT differences, etc. That's within the expected range of variance.<p>Also, asm.js code is faster even without special optimizations compared to handwritten JS (see for example <a href=""http://blog.j15r.com/blog/2011/12/15/Box2D_as_a_Measure_of_Runtime_Performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.j15r.com/blog/2011/12/15/Box2D_as_a_Measure_of_R...</a> and <a href=""http://blog.j15r.com/blog/2013/04/25/Box2d_Revisited"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.j15r.com/blog/2013/04/25/Box2d_Revisited</a> ).

I could easily run tens of them.<p>You can share folders with the host and serve files from the virtual machine in a completly prod like environnement. You can also isolate projects in separated machines. For those who think that a unix box is closer to prod think of how many conflicts you can have with tons of libs installed on the same laptop : python, ruby, php, node.js, mysql, mongodb, etc... It is really different from a prod machine anyway. And Virtualbox works better (faster ) on Windows because the shared folder implementation of VirtualBox is better on Windows ;).<p>I'm not sure how it will turn out for me as I'm not very far in this process, but it seems to be awesome for the moment.",1367592539

The first big tool is the cracker itself.  John The Ripper and HashCat are 2 popular ones today, but I've focused my reading on hashcat.<p>Hashcat is a tool who's goal is to do various hashing functions as fast as possible in both CPU and GPU (depending on what the user has available).  Where the tool gets interesting is the attack modes[1] it has.  Each of the attack methods has different use cases, but I would say Rule-based and table-lookup are both fairly interesting (allow for smart generating of test passwords so things it's not a full character set brute-force).<p>Now, you have other groups that are going out and doing analysis on database password leaks[2].  This site tries to crack as many passwords as it can from publically leaked password databases (such as Gawker ane EHarmony), then do an analysis of the passwords they have cracked thus far.  People can then use this data to write rules for Hashcat or other tools to possibly crack passwords a lot faster.<p>As rules for passwords change and people change their password habits, the crackers will adjust their methods.  While this article does bring out some interesting points about passwords, it can still be good to know what tools the crackers have at their disposal so you can think about how to craft a password that won't be easily cracked.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hashcat.net/wiki/#attack_modes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hashcat.net/wiki/#attack_modes</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.adeptus-mechanicus.com/codex/hashpass/hashpass.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adeptus-mechanicus.com/codex/hashpass/hashpass.ph...</a>",1367591901

Its ""point"" if there is one - is to test your product hypothesis and evaluate product/market fit at a point in time.<p><i>The first step in avoiding spending that much money, is to be able to quantify the costs of building an MVP.</i><p>You can't do that, as you know neither the definition of ""minimum"" nor the definition of ""viable"" when you first start.  That's the whole point of the iterative process.  You start building to the Founders' vision, and then go out and try to find customers for that.  It's only when you think that you have a testable product hypothesis that you can even speculate about what an ""MVP"" would look like.<p>I think part of the problem with these discussions though, is that ""MVP"" has become part buzzword and part synonym for ""prototype"" or ""alpha"" or ""first version"".  It's not necessarily the same as those things though.<p><i>Besides, a stealth fighter jet cannot be a MVP. Maybe you have better maneuvering technology, or targeting technology, or maybe you have teleportation technology. That would be the basis of your MVP.</i><p>Right, that's why I said ""an idea for a new stealth fighter jet"".  I certainly am not proposing to build a complete jet as an MVP... I can't imagine many - if any - scenarios where that makes sense.  But building an MVP of the ""magic sauce"" that allows you to demonstrate to the DoD that your new stealth fighter jet will be better, is probably still going to be a lot more expensive than the ""cat photo sharing site"" thing.   All I'm really saying is that there's a broad range in how much a MVP might cost, depending on the domain and the problems you're trying to solve.",1367591761

Some of these jobs are more fun than others. There are huge conflicts of interest within what is called a ""manager"" and ultimately, employees get shafted.<p>Managers ultimately end up as the internal police force, because they're the ones who make firing and promotion decisions. However, there are a huge number of dirty cops. Most of them, in fact, are dirty. There are a few sadists who enjoy using the badge-and-gun just to fuck with people. There are others (much more common) who go full-on extortionist and use their power to build an image of outsized performance so they can hop out of cop work and into an executive or high-level strategic position. Rare is what police are supposed to be: principled public servants.<p>I don't have a problem with police. Society needs them.

In this benchmark, we have reasonably simple requests on decent hardware in the realm of 1 second latency, where faster frameworks are 10+ times faster.  We have Sinatra being far slower than similar frameworks like Scalatra, Unfiltered.<p>Yes, you can write Ruby in C, but it would be almost as slow as writing Ruby in Ruby.  I don't really see the point of saying, you can do anything you can do in Ruby in C, it would be much more verbose and about as slow.  The point is that true optimization may force you to do things that you can only do in C and there's no guarantee that this optimized version can be easily utilized from the rest of your Ruby code.  This has nothing to do with tight-coupling - it's simply taking advantage of the language's abstraction facilities.<p>And no, having to write hand-tuned Ruby, as opposed to idiomatic Ruby, to get performance that can be had by writing, say, idiomatic Scala or Haskell is an indictment of slow implementations and prevents you from taking full advantage of the expressiveness provided by the language.<p>And that's before you get into things like your team may have to get bigger because you need a C/Ruby-extension expert, half the team not being able to understand a critical part of the code base (very few Ruby developers are reasonably competent in C), etc.<p>Again, the whole point is that Ruby's performance problems pose a real pain point.  Yes, you can rewrite parts of it in C, yes you can mitigate by using gems written in C, yes, you can spend more time optimizing, yes you can throw more hardware.  But all of those are costly and it's disingenuous to pretend that a problem doesn't exist simply because a workaround does.",1367590750

The problem is: they can't agree on anything except most basic game concepts.

Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is one example, it's an OS game with no commercial equivalent. Teeworlds is another. OS developers only reach consensus on widely liked game concepts, creativity is very unlikely to be accepted. Instead of working on something exciting, they work on something everyone hates the least. It's a management problem, not technical or motivation problem.

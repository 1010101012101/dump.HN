This is really just a side project of mine to get into hardware hacking and production. A lemonade stand, of sorts. Now that I have it ready to be produced from factories, and I have to decide if it's profitable to do so.<p>It isn't even a big time sink anymore, it's mostly just a capital risk. It costs me about 65 for one unit to be produced, 30 dollars for an xbox controller, and about 20 dollars in labor to pay someone to mod the controller and package everything together. So for small runs I have this product costing me about $115. This is for runs of 100, about.<p>The question is: do I put down $11,500 for 100 units and hope I can sell them? I don't see a lot of movement on the kickstarter pre-order page, but maybe people just don't like using kickstarter this way. But, everyone who tried it at the Maker Faire really fell in love with it. Finally, I'd love to get into the details of production of someone has questions or advice.",1275155879

As you imply, the taxes themselves are a negative, but some were spent on things directly relevant to Silicon Valley. One of the biggest was tons of university funding, especially up through the late-80s/early-90s (and especially compared to other states). In addition to the state generously funding UC Berkeley, Cal Poly, SJSU, etc. directly, Cal Grants used to pay full tuition for even private universities for CA high-school students above a certain academic threshhold, who chose to attend college within CA. That funneled lots of poor and lower-middle-class smart kids to in-state private universities, and indirectly subsidized the universities as well by having the state take on most of the need-based aid burden.",1275154751

However, if by using a ""professionally edited"" encyclopedia you are lulled into a false sense of trust then you are at a disadvantage. If instead you use an encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone and everyone on the internet, perhaps you will retain your senses of judgment and critical thinking. Perhaps you will double-check ""facts"" that seem a little fishy.<p><i>That</i>, ultimately, is why wikipedia is a better source of information in the long run. Any source of information compiled by any group of people will be full of biases and errors. It's infinitely more important that the public become more savvy information consumers, improving their critical thinking abilities, than that any given source of information is incrementally more ""accurate"" than another.",1275152630

Low res video feeds could be used for automatic heuristic recognition of bipedal targets.<p>Perfect a lightweight weapon like a Gyrojet, and this becomes a very effective area denial and recon system.  Combine this with Taser projectiles and you could have a very effective crowd control or prison security system.<p>14 minute battery life doesn't seem like a lot, but with a swarm, individual units could be programmed to return and perch on a battery exchange dock.  Such a system could be installed on a vehicle like a Humvee or an APC.",1275152555

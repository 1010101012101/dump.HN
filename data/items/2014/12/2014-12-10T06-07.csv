Voucher is a smart receipt printer that seamlessly and wirelessly sends a digital receipt to the consumer&#x27;s smartphone right at the checkout line for all transactions involving a credit/debit card. No more pockets, handbags, murses, or glovebox compartments filled with crumpled receipts. Voucher uses proprietary technology for which we have a patent pending, and is thus at the forefront of the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution.<p>With 82+ Billion credit/debit card transactions annually in just the US alone.Retailers in the US spend 3.4 Billion dollars a year on just the printer paper alone. Voucher has the potential to benefit both consumers and retailers, financially and environmentally.<p>We would really appreciate your comments, wisdom, advice, and support both publicly and financially as we attempt to realize our venture. Follow us on Twitter: @Voucher_Co for more informations and updates.<p>Check out our crowdfunding page on indiegogo<p>https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/voucher-world-s-first-smart-receipt-printer",1418194346

8727993,comment,8725202,8726057,0,0,Patrick_Devine,,,"I agree with you that the way we teach school is completely ridiculous, but 58 seconds for _preschool_ on math is probably fine.  Ages 3-5 are really about learning how to socialize, play and interact with the world, and it isn&#x27;t until about age 6-7 when many kids even develop an aptitude for mathematics.  Scandinavian countries use a concept called &quot;Readiness to Learn&quot; and don&#x27;t teach reading or mathematics until age 7.  Your children will likely be much better off playing and being kids in pre-school and learning things like how to sit still as well as fine motor control.<p>That said, yes, public schooling is insane.  We pile children into classrooms and then expect them to all learn the same subjects at the same rate.  We grade them based on arbitrary deadlines and we force them to learn more complex topics without making sure that they have mastered basic concepts.  How someone can get an &#x27;A&#x27; and not know 10% of subject matter is beyond me.  Oh, and in the US we force all children into the schizophrenic &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; program which encourages teachers to only teach to tests administered at arbitrary times.<p>In any kind of reasonable system, children would be able to learn at their own pace, and wouldn&#x27;t advance to more difficult subject matter until they had achieved 100% mastery.  Montessori teaching has elements of this, but I think it will really take new tools like Khan Academy and &quot;flipping the classroom&quot; to make it practicable.",1418194125

For example, in League of Legends, you have to play a gimpy fake version of your hero forever to unlock the real version.<p>In practice the high level players who you see on tournaments on Twitch are all playing with all cards (or max level heroes) available. In Magic: The Gathering this costs $xx,xxx (for modern) or $x,xxx (for standard). In League of Legends, this costs an unskippable grind, but you can pay to make the grind shorter. In Hearthstone, this costs about $800.<p>Notably, some competitive games do not have this property. In DotA, you can play every hero at full power without paying money or doing a forced grind. In Ultra Street Fighter 4, you can play every character at full power after buying the game for $40 or something.<p>Edit: anyway, the original comment was about &quot;purely intellectual&quot; esports.

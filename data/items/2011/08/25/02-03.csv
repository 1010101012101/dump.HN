Make sure you hire an excellent first employee, and have at least 8 months of operating expenses saved to cover your variable costs - that's after all the equipment has been purchased, improvements to your shop, etc.",1314241180

We're born, we live for a brief instant, and we die. It's been happening for a long time. Technology is not changing it much - if at all.<p>These technologies can make life easier, can let us touch people we might not otherwise. You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups, get medical information, the latest experimental drugs. These things can profoundly influence life. I'm not downplaying that. But it's a disservice to constantly put things in this radical new light - that it's going to change everything. Things don't have to change the world to be important.<p>The Web is going to be very important. Is it going to be a life-changing event for millions of people? No. I mean, maybe.

2923571,story,,,10,11,luvcraft,"Ask HN: OK, I've started-up, now how do I continue-up?",,"At the beginning of this year I ""soft launched"" a video game recommendation service. I knew how to build the site and make it work, but I'm mystified by marketing (even if I had a million dollars to throw at marketing I wouldn't know where to throw it), so I applied to a bunch of incubators (including YC, of course), sure that one of them would pick up the project because recommendation services were pretty sexy last winter. Alas, they all declined, but the site kept chugging along. A few other opportunities came up that distracted me from it, but they've all either run their course or failed to pan out, so now I'm back to the game recommender. It's steadily grown to 670+ users who have contributed a total of 40,000+ ratings, but obviously that's not nearly enough users to attract a potential buy-out or partnership, or make affiliate links lucrative, or even support my clever original plan of serving ads specifically to users who the recommendation engine had determined would like each ad.<p>Meanwhile, just as I'm getting back to it, Penny Arcade has announced that they're launching a similar service. That quells my worries that ""maybe there's just not a market for this"", and (hopefully) the services are different enough that both could survive. Also on the bright side, the Penny Arcade announcement has given me a boost in activity from people who were reminded by the announcement that my service already existed, and presumably also from people saying ""oh, that sounds neat! I wonder if there already is something like that..."" and finding mine.<p>I'm sure there's a huge market for this service, and the internet is filled with video game forums that I'm sure would be interested -- the site was briefly mentioned (with a link) on the second page of an unrelated thread on NeoGAF and got over a hundred hits just from that one link. But all of those forums have a strict ""no soliciting for your website"" policy, and they won't even reply when I email them asking for their advertising rates. I'm gnashing my teeth walking through a market filled with millions of potential customers, but forbidden from mentioning my wares to any of them.<p>So, HN, please tell me: where do I go from here? On the one hand I think my startup is ""successful"" because it does what it was designed to do, and it's providing a useful service to me and a bunch of other users, but on the other hand it's growing at a glacial pace and it's not making any money.<p>Help!",1314240686

Yes, the structure of computer programs isn't the <i>only</i> problem in computer science/software engineering. However, I would argue that it's the most <i>important</i> question. Moreover, it's the only question that translates well across domains.  Algorithms, concurrency models, networks, etc. all will vary depending on the exact problem you are trying to solve. The principles behind good program structure, however, remain the same. It doesn't matter if you're making a computational fluid dynamics simulation, nearest neighbor classifier, relational database, enterprise inventory control, or a simple blog engine; taking the time to create a good structure for your program always pays off.",1314240629

Also (more importantly), the emphasis for the reader is on the first concept ""dead grandmas"" rather than on food, so you're strongly suggesting that the topic is grandma-related, rather than food related. The first thing that jumps out should be a positive message, and related to your topic.<p>e) choose a maximum of two words, like your ""food baby"" example.<p>f) if you're on a budget, one strategy is to research keywords related to your cooking topic, and try to register a website name that is also a main keyword. This allows you to ""own"" that topic much more easily on Google, Yahoo searches, etc. Example: ""Food Baby"" would be a great website for baby food (the word order doesn't matter).<p>TOP GOAL FOR BRANDING: If you have a larger budget, a short, invented word is the  ultimate goal in branding your product - generic names can not be trademarked, so your concept can easily be copied. It's harder to get started, but in the long run a unique, branded name is the best if you have a budget. Example: QUANTAS is a made-up word (acronym) for an airline brand, it's short, memorable and suggests luxury, which is important to their core customer base.<p>Hope this helps! Cheers - J",1314240382

My absolutely first sentence in this thread is asking, what exactly the ""indeterminate form"" is. I'm asking this question, because this not a formal notion and you will not find any formal definition of it. Its existence is rooted in the fact that for no reason other than the tradition (and convenience) we use special notation for some functions. Instead of +: R x R -> R, +(2, 3) = 5, we write 2 + 3 = 5. The same goes for ^: [0, \infty] x R -> R. The only reason we have all those fancy <i>limit evaluating laws</i> is because these function are continuous most of the time. For instance, + is continuous everywhere, so lim +(a_n, b_n) = +(lim a_n, lim b_n), if both lim a_n and lim b_n make sense. Similarly, /: R x R - {0} -> R is also continuous everywhere, so lim /(a_n, b_n) = /(lim a_n, lim b_n), if the right hand expression makes sense. If it does not make sense, for instance when both lim a_n and lim b_n are equal to zero, we need cannot approach this problem in such a simple way. Now, some people would call /(0, 0) an ""indeterminate form"", which makes for me no more sense than calling f(0, 0) an indeterminate form, where f(x, y) = log_(1/x) (y) -- while f is continuous everywhere where defined, you cannot extend its domain to contain (0, 0) for it to stay continuous, just like you cannot do it with / function.<p>As I repeated many times, the whole affair is because ^ seem to be more familiar than beta function (we have a special notation for it, for instance), people want it to behave nicely, so that for instance it conforms to some arbitrary limit evaluating laws, missing the whole underlying concept of continuity.",1314240113

It could be 1, -1, 0, infinite, etc. depending on how you reached it (say, sin(x)/x versus sin(x)/x^2).  The issue is not the continuity of x/x; the issue is whether setting a convention for 0/0 would give you the right value for a limit.  Since it doesn't always, we call it ""indeterminate"".<p>Similarly, if you're evaluating a limit and you get 0^0 you need to do more work.  You can't just stop and say ""oh, that's 1"".  It depends on what function you used to get there -- x^x will give you a different answer from ( e^(-1/x) )^x.  Again, it has nothing to do with the continuity of exponentiation.  The issue is whether the convention of 0^0=1 is correct <i>in the specific part of mathematics you're working in</i>.<p>The same argument can be made if you're working in the hyperreals, or if you're working with field axioms -- the convention 0^0 <i>doesn't work in that context</i>.<p>Please, by all means, use the convention 0^0=1 <i>when it's appropriate</i>.

He may have been the primary motivator for the development of the iPad and iPhone, but he didn't create OpenCL, libdispatch, CoreAnimation, and Automatic Reference Counting. He didn't invent the unibody construction process or Gorilla Glass or LightPeak or multi-touch, and he's obviously not the only person at Apple who can recognize their value and figure out how to use them to make a better product.

You need to get enough profs to teach a degree's worth of classes, especially if you're getting accreditation.  (also, as an aside, the accreditations  that matter require you to have a few years of successful classes).  You also need a system for handling communication with teachers and students, grading, actually giving the lectures, and education software is not cheap. So as you hopefully can see, its not really bootstrap-able or easily scalable.   You need money, and you need to get it right the first time, because you'll lose that money if you don't get enough students.  Also, you need to be able to operate at a loss for several years, because it will take a long time to get accreditation.  College is a lot about signaling - thats why it matters where you actually go.  A few credits from a brand new online college is not great on a resume, so there will not be as much demand.<p>So, how about instead you try to take the tutorial concept and and apply it to practical skills?  2 classes of biology from an online college isn't really useful to someone.  2 classes of SEO or knitting or 'How to contract with the federal government' is really useful to people. This would also make it easy to recuit instructors.  You could find retired people who just got out of an industry and want to make a little more money, or working professionals who want the feeling of giving back.<p>Here's kind of a short vision for a site i think has a shot at being successful.  Have bios of the instructors, spelling out how they can actually give you good instruction in the course they're offering.  Let people apply - advertise a class size capped at a certain number of people, and be upfront about costs.  You split the cost with the instructor, so they only get paid if they bring in business.  Don't use an essay, its a big barrier to conversion.  Have people write 100-200 words on why they want to take the class, what experience they have in the area, and their future goals.  Let the instructor choose who to take if more people apply than the class size.  Bootstrap your way to more and more courses - and make the courses practical skills.  There are a million websites that will teach me biology or history or math - most of them free and a lot better than what you'll be able to do.

2923473,comment,2922336,2923376,1,0,xyzzyz,,,"Please, treat exponentiation just like every other function out there. I don't get the whole limit argument at all. Given any function f: R x R -> R, if it happens that a_n -> a, b_n -> b, but lim f(a_n, b_n) != f(a, b), people just say that f is not continuous in (a, b), and the case is over. However, if f happens to be exponentiation function, people instead argue that f should not be defined in (a, b), forgetting about the fact that the theorem which lets you take a limit of an argument instead of a limit of a function values works only under assumption that f is continuous in a proper point. Instead of noting that there's no contradiction because the assumptions are not satisfied, people just run away from it, declaring 0^0 as undefined.<p>From this point of view, the whole notion of ""indeterminate form"" makes just as little sense as distinguishing some arbitrary class of functions and calling them ""elementary"". Why are some points of discontinuity of some functions more special than other points of discontinuity of other functions? Why sin is more elementary than gamma? Historical heritage of confusion, I guess.",1314238279

I think breaking free from design norms (as long as rules of simplicity are followed) is a good thing. It is what will make users think ""wow, this is something I haven't seen before"" and thus probably more likely to use it and tell others about it as well. Of course this assumes clever design sense which I believe is something people possess naturally and can't really be taught.",1314238103

It had horrible problems with performance and hardware compatibility, but the software itself didn't seem to contain glaring issues - at least if you calibrated your expectations to the perception of its quality by the market and end users.<p>On the other hand, Apple always nails the user experience - a release like Vista just wouldn't get out the door.  But they let other horrendous quality problems through that would and should be caught by better process.<p>So it sort of illustrates two fairly orthogonal axes of quality and how different companies excel in different directions along those axes.",1314237609

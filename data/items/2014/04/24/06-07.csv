As Wilson observes, &quot;Since the financial crisis of 2008, policy makers in the developed world have kept interest rates at or near zero. They have flooded the market with cheap money in an attempt to heal the wounds (losses) of the financial crisis and incent business owners to invest and grow their businesses.&quot; It&#x27;s kind of amazing that he doesn&#x27;t see how years of unprecedented coordinated central bank action could drive and sustain bubbles.<p>> It’s been a good time to be in the VC and startup business and I think it will continue to be as long as the global economy is weak and rates are low.<p>As an investor, there is no doubt that DFTF and BTFD has been very profitable, but the implication that a weak global economy and low interest rates is essentially responsible for sustaining the good times should be disturbing to anyone with exposure to the venture capital asset class given what it is supposed to represent.<p>Incidentally, I think it&#x27;s somewhat amusing that VCs are asked the &quot;Are we in a bubble question?&quot; in the first place.

I think they were not aware of the hypocrisy, merely highlighting it is often enough to stop people in their tracks.<p>> <i>If they&#x27;re putting bugs in the code to generate money-making after-hours calls, then they&#x27;ll accuse you of doing it.</i><p>It wasn&#x27;t a software house, it was an optometrist. They were passing off another optometrist&#x27;s varifocals as their own. If they were caught, it would be impossible to accuse me of doing it. I worked in the front office dealing with paperwork, I am not optically trained  (it&#x27;s equivalent to studying medicine) and I was not involved in purchases, only sales.<p>> <i>If they&#x27;re bullying you, they&#x27;ll very quickly and loudly call you the bully if you reciprocate in any way. Although they&#x27;re monitoring you closely, they&#x27;ll soon notice and single you out if you try it on them.</i><p>Who said I was going to resort to bullying, I&#x27;m referring to <i>implicit blackmail</i>, level out the field. Suggest the possibility via suitable questions and rhetoric, but never mention it directly. Regarding any kind of monitoring, the higher ups weren&#x27;t monitoring the workplace effectively, which is partly why this kind of behaviour occurred. The surfacing section at the back of the building was highly inefficient and the problem was rarely discussed, let alone addressed. There were several people who didn&#x27;t do any work at all, that&#x27;s mental inefficiency. I was once asked to keep quiet regarding some of my co-workers drinking beer on site. The higher ups would smoke cigarettes inside the building, again asked to keep quiet (smoking indoors at work was banned in Britain the previous year, and the place was stocked with gallons of methanol and white spirit, BOOM).<p>> <i>They&#x27;ll then present the publicly visible aspects of their own harassment as a proportional response to yours, hiding the full extent of their own, the fact they started it, and how tolerant you were of them at first.</i><p>One colleague used to shout &quot;FUCK OFF&quot; at me on average three to four times a day, in front of a dozen witnesses. Not everybody at that place was a cunt, some of them were cool. Sometimes the phone was left off the hook, so his bad behaviour had been heard by the customers on several occasions. There is simply too much evidence lying around.<p>> <i>You don&#x27;t just decide to copy and adapt their tactics one day - the enemy have spent their entire lives honing their own skills in hypocrisy, bullying, whitewashing, and fleecing you of money.</i><p>In this case, the enemy was incredibly retarded. Another colleague once asked me to spell &quot;claustrophobia&quot; when she was sitting in front of a computer connected to the internet. One of the delivery men thought that the computer wasn&#x27;t connected to the internet.<p>Oh, here&#x27;s the best bit.

7638781,comment,7632094,7636725,1,0,elohesra,,,"> And finally - although unscientific, the high upcount of this article suggests that it hit a nerve and that many here are unsatisfied with the quality of their friendships.<p>See, you used the term &#x27;suggests&#x27; rather than &#x27;proves&#x27; because you know that claiming a stronger relationship between upvotes and motive would be affirming the consequent. But this is precisely the sort of weasel-wording which I&#x27;ve seen in observational studies, and it seems deliberately crafted to trick an uncanny reader ill-versed in logic into misinterpreting &#x27;suggests&#x27; as &#x27;proves&#x27;. Of course, we both know that we cannot infer anything from a consequent other than one of the possible antecedents must have occurred, and we both know that the antecedents in this case -- motive for clicking upvote -- is huge, and thus nothing meaningful can be inferred about the consequent. I&#x27;m happy to have a discussion about almost anything, but if someone comes to the party with nonsense evidence pretending the discussion has already been studied and decided, I&#x27;m going to call them on it.<p>I also feel like you&#x27;ve also dodged every point I&#x27;ve raised (or perhaps I didn&#x27;t explain my objections very well). With regards to #1, the issue wasn&#x27;t that I think researchers are deliberately crafting leading questions, but that in order for the study to be valid they&#x27;d have to show that their questions either <i>do not lead</i> thus aren&#x27;t confounding (which I&#x27;ve argued is impossible), or that they lead predictably thus can be countered in the analysis (which I also argued is impossible).<p>With #2 you&#x27;re correct that this is an issue for all studies, but it&#x27;s a particularly large issue for studies of things which are irreducibly complex, like people. Since we can&#x27;t (easily) take specific facets of a person and study those in silo from the rest of a person, controlling confounding variables becomes a bigger issue. Even in other observational sciences we can usually demonstrate the core parts of our assumptions in a controlled experimental manner. For instance, in the study of global warming, we can demonstrate in a controlled, experimental way that the combustion of fossil fuels releases CO2. With studies of human behaviour this is rarely possible.<p>With #3 you&#x27;re correct that the media is far guiltier of this than the scientists, but I&#x27;d argue that scientists need to be more vocal about this issue. I appreciate this treads a fine line between asking for more scientific social responsibility, and holding scientists responsible for the behaviour of society, but I feel this is a valid concern due to the way that politicians like to fund studies such as these to validate their personal opinion. The reason I believe this important isn&#x27;t that I think scientists are trying to dupe us, far from it, but because it worries me that as burden the of proof for a posteriori logic falls from the strongly codified and philosophically justified rules of empiricism and falsifiability, so scientists move from being discoverers of truth to yet another controllable authority figure.<p>Also, thank you again for citing evidence for your point. I apologise that I have not done so, but I seriously doubt any scientists actually agree with me here. Having read your linked study, I would say it both stands to reason and doesn&#x27;t really seem to prove the point it claims to prove. If you set out to prove that self-reporting isn&#x27;t invalidated by confounding variables, and you do so by invoking self-reporting which contains almost exactly the same confounding variables, then you can&#x27;t really claim to have proved anything. Relatives and friends of a sample in such a study would be just as likely to change their answers, consciously or subconsciously, to avoid internal conflict, and because they&#x27;re tied to the sample in such a way that would produce a similar personality and similar self-identity reprisals if the subject&#x27;s life choice were cast in doubt, it&#x27;s also not a large leap of logic that their changed answers would usually change along the same lines as the sample.<p>Again, I can&#x27;t really think of a better way of studying complex issues like human behaviour, but since we started at the point of &#x27;science agrees self-reporting is fine&#x27; and are now at &#x27;we agree it is the best we can get&#x27;, I feel we&#x27;re moving in the right direction. I do agree that well-controlled self-report studies are probably the best we can get in this field, it just seems to me that the best we can get isn&#x27;t as valid as the best we can get in experimental sciences, and should be noted as such.",1398321016

Companies tend to be valued at 15 * revenue, on large aggregate.<p>With these earnings their PE ratio will go from 72 to 57, assuming the stock price doesn&#x27;t increase. If this stock deleverages at the same speed as google stock did, over 2 years, the share price will be $35-$30 by the end of the year ...<p>If the pe ratio gets in line with S&P 500 &quot;normal&quot; pe ratio of 15 (actually more like 10-15, but recently it&#x27;s been nearer 15 than 10), facebook is only worth $17 per share.<p>Now the default argument is &quot;but growth&quot;, so I fit a third degree curve to their earnings. So I fit a second-degree curve to their eps (this assumes it&#x27;s on an exponential growth trajectory, quite generous I would say), and at what point would their valuation become justified at standard S&P 500 ratios ? Q1 2017. This is assuming FB&#x27;s exponential growth holds up. That&#x27;s not as bad as I feared it would be, but still it&#x27;s pretty bad.<p>EPS curve for facebook:\n0.005 x^2 - 0.0015 x + 0.12 (x is measured in number of quarters since Q2 2012.

Why does this need exist? We have the Internet now. There is no such need anymore.<p>Let me ask you a different question: why do we need to have any candidates whatsoever? What are they for? Or the more important question: what is a public office for? What is the purpose of that concept?<p>> Instead, you change the rules such that candidates simply do not have the money to spend, then you watch as the media, parties, candidates, and entire political process re-structure themselves to allow for viable candidates to be identified and subsequently engaged with the electorate.<p>If you don&#x27;t subscribe to Rootstrikers, you are seriously out of touch.

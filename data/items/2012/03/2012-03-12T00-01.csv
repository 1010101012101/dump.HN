I held up my hand to my computer as if to say ""Hold on, computer.""<p>It was a bit surreal. Very cool. Can't wait for more gestures or a generalized way to program my own gestures. I would love to be able to gesture ""Switch to iTerm.app"" by doing an OK sign or something. Sign language letters maybe?<p>Anyway, thanks. Really enjoy it already, can't wait for more. Also, I would pay money for this. If it had all of the play/pause/forward/back functionality I think I'd give you 4.99 if it was accurate. Just sayin'.",1331513962

But, +Martijn Verburg, there's a pretty big difference between submitting a patch to a library and submitting a patch to a ""project"". Patches to libraries are typically changes/additions/removals to the API, whereas patches to 'projects' are typically changes to the internals. It's a whole lot easier to change the internals of something than it is to change the API. Changing the API means the effects can bubble outwards. Changing the internals is usually just optimizations or bug-fixes.""<p>haha wow. this is why I love java programmers",1331513095

Facebook is a great example of that. In a video you can now find on Youtube, Mark Zuckerberg was describing theFacebook as a directory for college students. Not super ambitious. But then, he realized that he could open it up...and make it a platform, and that became super ambitious.
You could say the same about Twitter, I think.<p>The risk of being too ambitious at first is being unable to ship your MVP because it appears too narrow vs. the ambition you have in your head.

There are some chicken and egg issues that make it very difficult and the government is a pain in the ass about it too.<p>The rule of thumbs are that you cannot control the business that is giving you a visa (you can be fired from the job), the company has to demonstrate significant financial resources to employ you, and you have to do the transfer in a way that doesn't raise red flags with the government. Let's break these down.<p>1 - you cannot have a controlling interest in the business. This means you need a cofounder or cofounders so that your share of the business is less than 50%. Finding cofounders is tough. Especially cofounders who want to run the risk of you being deported during the next 4 years. Yes, there are ways to do it so that you own 49% and your cofounder owns 51%, but then you better be really sure that you want to give up board control and company control to this other person. This also means that your cofounder has to be a citizen or green card holder. Lots of constraints...<p>2 - financial resources either means you're putting up a million dollars of your own money or you've gotten an investor to give you $500k. But why is an investor going to give you $500k without a product or cofounder ready to go, and with a chance that you may run into visa issues and not be able to run the business? And therein is the chicken-and-egg situation. You can't stay without a financially sound company. But no one will give you money if you can't stay. So most people wait till they have a green card or build something on the side until they can get some traction or get some clients so they can show enough traction to raise funding.<p>3 - we almost got screwed with one of our employees at Spool because the government thought we didn't exist. Pre-launch we didn't have a website, our address was a UPS box, and though we were funded and clearly real, the USCIS basically rejected the visa transfer for one of our employees because they thought we were a shell company setup just for this guy to stay in the US without working.<p>Ultimately, there are people in an office at USCIS that make these decisions. These people will reject applications if something smells fishy, will reject it if they think this is a shell corporation just so you can stay in the US, or if they don't understand that startups get started and hire employees in month 1 of existence. Keep in mind that this transfer has to happen quickly. Your previous employer has something like 30 days to report that you don't work there any more. And your new employer gets to keep you in the country as long as the visa transfer is in process, but if you get rejected you're out of the country. So the transfer needs to happen quickly...and often your company just got started, has no other employees, has no website or product in the marketplace yet, and various other red flags as far as USCIS is concerned. The sequencing of all of these events in practice is difficult.<p>===== The best option =====
There are lots of ""clever"" options. I don't endorse any of them and you try them at your own risk. The safest option is to try and start something on the side, get enough traction to be able to pull together a seed round, and then have that new company sponsor your h1b. Lots of investors will give you money if you demonstrate the beginnings of a real business. This is extremely difficult though...you will basically need to work two full time jobs until you can raise a seed round.<p>I really wish it weren't this way but unfortunately the US government's rules were built in a manufacturing era and make no sense in our modern information age.<p><i></i><i>Disclaimer: This is not legal advice.

The big problem with that is what we call the ""then what"" problem -- if Google doesn't buy you, then what?

I can split them up from within git's CLI with `git add -p`, but this can be cumbersome. GitX lets me quickly choose which chunks and/or lines I want to commit, and exactly what is staged. There's also a commit message box right there, so I usually end up committing right there.<p>What I do agree wholeheartedly with is using the Git CLI for tree operations. Knowing what you're doing with `git pull`, or knowing when to rebase as opposed to a merge is incredibly useful when using git, and ultimately makes your usage of git more effective.<p>In short, I advocate using some sort of interface (GitX, fugitive.vim) for staging, and possible committing, but the git CLI should be used for almost everything else (except submodules, which seem to require an unholy mix of git and normal file operations).",1331510949

Each user (should) have their own local repository. Users commit, branch etc their local repository, and then push to a central repository. You can (and many people do) use git without ever having a central repository to push or pull from.<p>By definition collaborative git is <i>always</i> multiple repo (unless you're doing something weird like all using the same working directory in a network share, but that'd defeat most of the purpose of git and be a terrible idea). You work on your own repo, and then push changes when you're done.<p>tzs is right in that what tool I use to manage my local repo is irrelevant to the operation of the repository. Git doesn't mind what tool I used. When it does matter how you're committing is if you're discussing doing things in git - it can cause confusion when someone's trying to find a GUI menu to do something.<p>The remote server argument's also valid, and probably the best reason to encourage people to use the command line.

3691717,comment,3691457,3691457,1,0,roryokane,,,"I actually learned Git only with the help of GUI. Beforehand, I read a bunch of tutorials, but I just couldn't figure out the process of using Git, and how to use it in my everyday workflow. Then I used Tower (<a href=""http://www.git-tower.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.git-tower.com/</a>) when it was in beta, and everything became so much clearer.<p>The GUI made everything intuitive by leading me through common tasks, instead of forcing me to memorize what is related to what. It showed file diffs on a bottom pane when I click on them, revealing that what Git cares about are changes to files. It showed a commit message draft on the right, indicating that what I am always working towards is a commit. The tabs clearly divided the workflow into two rough modes: making changes and examining history. These visual cues helped me understand the concepts within Git. Tower is also faster at staging only certain lines of a change, letting me use the mouse to point to those lines rather than going through the git add -i workflow of ""split this hunk, split it again, yes stage that one, no don't stage that one"", etc.<p>Now that I understand Git's concepts, I can use and have used Git on the command-line, but for now I use the GUI whenever possible. I still don't feel confident enough in my knowledge of all of Git's details, such as the commands to resolve merge conflicts, so the GUI's continued guidance is reassuring. Perhaps after I've used it actively for a few more months, a workflow like jenius describes at the end, using custom aliases for commands I use often, will be better for me.",1331510482

And I know this makes us look all manner of self-absorbed, arrogant and unappreciative. That's what I'd think in your shoes. So it's time I tried to explain to you more fully why it's like this.<p>I realize that from your perspective, you're handing us a shiny new feature on a silver platter. It should be making our decision easy, since the work is already done. It's a gift of your time and effort and you've already solved the problem and all we need to do is just accept it! Looked at that way, we're either idiots or jerks for not being interested.<p>But here's the part that I don't think many of you understand: the work you've done to produce that patch is actually minuscule compared to the total amount of work we have to do to put it in Guava. I know that it feels to you like you've certainly gotten us more than halfway there, but trust me, it's only scratched the surface.<p>- We have to work out whether the problem it's trying to solve is truly the right problem
- We have to work out whether the solution presented is truly the best solution we can come up with
- We have to find evidence in the internal Google codebase that users will actually use the proposed feature if we create it. If we are adding methods to our libraries that don't get used, it hurts our case when we try to argue to management that we're doing important work and need more staff.
- We have to figure out how it relates to the piles of legacy code we have floating around our libraries (that you, lucky folks you are, don't even see!), and how we would deal with migrating those users if they exist.
- We have to decide the best name and location for the new API. This is hard! We spend a lot of time in our API review meetings just batting names around.
- We have to review the code deeply. Our code reviews are grueling and go on for many rounds. When you look at the code in Guava it tends to look ""obvious"", but we work very hard to achieve that quality. It's only obvious in hindsight.
- In almost every case we have to completely rewrite the javadoc that first gets submitted to us. And this is very hard. Writing good documentation is probably the biggest challenge we ever face.
- The tests that were first written are rarely sufficient; we're going to need to add more. When we do, some usually fail.
- If the change touches on any existing functionality, we have to submit it to Google's global submit queue and analyze test results from many thousands of projects to make sure we won't break any internal users with it.
- If the change goes in, we have to deal with the machinery that gets that change integrated out to you in Guava.
- We then become responsible for fixing any bugs with it that come up over time, and dealing with the related feature requests it will touch off.
- And the code never ""stays finished' in general; we are constantly performing various maintenance tasks over our whole library (or even the whole codebase of Google), to make various cross-cutting improvements, and every bit of new code added increases that burden.<p>There's more I'm leaving out, but you get the idea. Guava did not get to the level of quality it has by accident, but by us being really obsessive about these things.<p>Now, when the patch comes from outside Google, we have additional mechanical overhead. One of us has to sponsor the patch as if it's their own, converting it into an internal patch that can merge correctly (which isn't always as trivial as it sounds), and sending it for review to another member of the team. And because we are the ones most familiar with our own style, conventions, practices and pitfalls to avoid, etc., sometimes just doing that plus ""cleaning up"" the code to get it ready for review is already more time-consuming than if we had written it ourselves from the start. That doesn't even mean that the code sent to us in the patch was bad. It can be very good by most standards but still need a lot of rework for our purposes.<p>Remember, if your feature is valuable, then we're going to want it in Guava whether you provided a patch or not. Providing the patch doesn't make it more likely that we'll decide it's a good fit for Guava -- if anything it just puts us more on guard against that seductive temptation to think ""but it's already mostly done anyway, might as well!""<p>And here's the last thing. Be honest: if you were going to sign yourself up for doing all that work above... wouldn't you at least want to have the pleasure of writing the code for it yourself? I love writing code -- that's why I do this! -- but such a large majority of my time goes into activities like those described above. If my job were all about just applying other people's patches, I would inevitably start hating it after a while. Let me have some fun sometimes, okay? :-)<p>I really hope this helps to understand why your patches seem to go into a black hole. I know that no matter what I say it will probably continue to seem unappreciative and condescending, and I apologize. I do recognize that you are just trying to help. But, if you really want to help, then keep an eye out for the times when we will ask for help on a particular issue, because that's where your time and energy will really do the most good!<p>Rantingly yours,

Programming languages are collections of tools to make products. “Language A vs. Language B” is usually similar to “Saws and Hammers vs. Wrenches and Screwdrivers”. Lisp, however, is a collection of solid and useful tools that are amazingly made entirely out of Lego bricks. If you need a new tool, you can easily make one on the fly. You can even build configurable Lego machines that spit out custom Lego creations on demand. But, you have to be careful that you don’t end up with a shop full of oddities that even you don’t understand anymore.",1216651413

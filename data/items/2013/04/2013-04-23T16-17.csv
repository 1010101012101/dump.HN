Several code sections in CA prohibit insurance against ""willful acts, wrongful acts and criminal acts."" However, Comeback's goal with custodial insurance isn't to make the consequences of being convicted of crimes less severe, it's to reduce the likelihood of recidivism upon release.<p>In a state where the recidivism rate is a staggering 65%, at a cost of tens of millions of dollars to taxpayers, we need something radical to turn things around. Over 40% of the prison population is incarcerated for violating the terms of their probation or parole. Custodial insurance is just crazy and disruptive enough of a concept to make a difference in reducing these obscene numbers.<p>We're working diligently to garner support amongst community activists, religious leaders, and most importantly politicians in hopes of easing any potential restrictions in offering custodial insurance.<p>Sadly there's a very real possibility that despite our noble intentions, Comeback may ultimately  lead to a failed business and some very heavy fines...possibly even jail time.",1366736365

The benefit of Dropbox (and similar server backed services) is that the most up-to-date version of a file is simply there as soon as you are connected to the Internet.  Most people who have two computers wont be using them both at the same time.  For example, a common use case for these services is syncing files while you are traveling.  Requiring a user who edits files on a laptop to turn their laptop on when they get back to the home/office in order for the changes to be recognize on their desktop seems like a big step backwards.  In that use case Sync would just be a glorified USB thumb drive.",1366736349

I've met people in their early forties with kids who were fully grown and out of their house.  They are able to live as a couple without small children while they are still young and healthy.  Also, they can more easily contribute to their grandchildren's childcare because they will be younger and healthier.  There's definitely something to be said for that.  I had kids at 31 and 33 and I find it really hard and tiring to care for them now at 37.  I can't even imagine what it would feel like if I was over 50.<p>Personally I think younger is better, but it's different for everyone.",1366736335

For a first stage rocket the advantages of coming down on land via just parachutes are pretty much non-existent to negative.<p>First off, if the goal is to save fuel from having to do a propulsive return to the launch site then that's not going to happen (except for the 2nd stage and capsule). The US has a lot of sparsely inhabited land but it doesn't have the same huge swathes of uncared for steppe that Russia/Kazakhstan have where they can just dump spent rocket stages everywhere with nary a care. There are range safety issues there that can't easily be avoided. Second, a giant rocket stage coming down on just parachutes is going to be damaged more on land than at sea. If you're trying to avoid the weight of landing gear you're just going to end up with the rocket engines crunching into the ground, which isn't going to be good at any speed. OK, so you can't save RTLS fuel, and you can't avoid having landing gear, at that point the only difference is a tiny little dribble of fuel to bring the stage in for a controlled powered landing. So you might as well just do that and be done with it.",1366736170

One of the most difficult parts is getting the custom design from the station into our system, because there's a huge learning hurdle if the station designer has to learn our software. So rather than build software that will a) be shitty at first, and b) create new roadblocks, we instead chose a different route which is described here: Manual scaling.<p>They send us a PSD, since they'd already use photoshop to create the look. We then manually convert it into our system.<p>It sucks because it's definitely going to become a weak point of scaling out our system, but till we hit that weak point, we keep going.

Too overwhelming.<p>What if instead of assuming the user is there for two reasons or no reason at all, give them a list of potential options. I'd assume most people going to the site are doing so for birthdays, so being able to sort by age, gender or interest is relevant right off the bat. I can't ever find the site that I felt did this best.. I want to say it was called ""Wanttts""/""Wanted"" or something.<p>As far as that initial selection is concerned, if you decide to keep it, I should only need to click once on my option to have the filter activated instead of clicking once on the option and clicking a second time to submit that option. I'm now two clicks into Father's Day and there are zero options for me, <i>and</i> I can't click my back button.<p>As a normal user, I'd be frustrated enough with the site at this point to leave it and go to Amazon.<p>Now clicking into Mother's Day gifts, I'm presented with radio options, despite the fact that my mother could be all of those things. I click on Stylish & Whimsical (which honestly doesn't even make sense for these two to be paired together) and get a list of 5 items that are neither stylish nor whimsical (a knife, a bland sweater, a set of wooden coasters, a rainbow headwrap and some wine glass lamps). In fact, my mom would probably roll her eyes at all of those. They are simply not thoughtful gifts.<p>As a normal user, I'd probably be done with the site at this point.<p>The star on each image is way too big and insinuates I'd be favoriting the item for later rather than adding it to my shopping cart. I didn't even read the text above it because I thought it was a page title (as it's an H3), not instructions on how to use the site.<p>So let's say my mom is equally silly and into knives, so I click the star on the knife in hopes that I'll see other gifts like it. No, instead I'm on a screen that tells me the price of the knife and would I like to add it to my cart. I click back because I'm not sure what that page was all about and I'm taken all the way back to the homepage where I'm being told to start <i>all over again</i>.<p>As a normal user, I'd definitely be done with the site at this point.<p>Okay, let's try this again.<p>I go through the exact same process, clicking the exact same options.. and I get <i>different</i> results? Where were all these options before? Five random options is just not enough for me to feel your site is effectively helping me choose something personalized. Again, under Stylish & Whimsical, I see items that are neither (perfume, cheap-looking bookstand, tacky seedboxes, a Samurai umbrella (what?) and a wire cage shaped like a barrel for corks).<p>Having the notification show up on the ""View Gifts"" button is the reason I clicked on it before, because I assumed that was the next action, even though the header tells me to click on the star to show more options. Progressive actions should be on the right side, stagnating/reverse options should be on the left. Likewise, the only time a button should be orange or red (unless it's notably thematic across the site) is when it is a negative action. A shopping cart view in particular should be in the top/primary navigation.<p>In continually clicking through the suggestions, I'm not finding anything that makes me think that the initial category I selected at the beginning has anything to do with the gifts I'm being shown, nor does it look to be actively filtering based on additional things I keep starring. And as noted before, all of these gifts are pretty bad/cheap-looking.<p>- - -<p>TL;DR<p>- The design needs a lot of work (the palette, the UX) and it should be a lot easier to navigate and understand what is going on. As others have mentioned, taking control of the back button is a terrible idea.<p>- The items you have aren't thoughtful/curated enough and the photography is weak (not that you can help it necessarily, but a better design would lessen how much it affects the overall appearance and I'd imagine that the more luxury the brand, the better the photos). When I'm looking for gifts using services like this, I'm doing it because I want to find unique items; probably gifts that cost a little extra to begin with. The items on your site are all things I could find on Amazon within a few clicks. If I wanted ThinkGeek-quality gifts, I'd go to Spencer's.<p>- Have users search by more specific keywords/interests instead of trying to lump people into categories they either don't fit into at all or that multiple could apply to.<p>There are a lot of gift-searching sites out there, and a lot of them have these same issues. What problem were you trying to solve with site? Why would people use a specialty service to find the same types of things that show up on Google Shopping or incentivized Bing Shopping searches? I guess I don't understand why already-popular vendors are listed at all. Gift-finding services should be about highlighting unique gifts that are handmade or crafted by specialists, curated by tastemakers. You don't need to advertise for Nordstrom's.",1366735973

Their added well being or happiness from spending that time with their children instead of at their business is not easily quantifiable and is more of a feeling.

It's a solid radio with a lousy stock firmware, but there are a number of good open soruce firmwares out there that are very easy to flash onto the controller (especially if you use something like the SmartieParts programming board). For ~$100 (for the radio plus the programmer) you end up with something that rivals radios costing an order of magnitude more (or so I've heard... I've never touched a high end radio).<p>I'm approaching the hobby in stages:<p>1) Buy a Blade mQX (which comes with a cheap transmitter) and learn the basics of flying a multirotor<p>2) Get a 9x transmitter, mod it, and learn how it works<p>3) Get a 'JR compatible' OrangeRX DSM2/DSMX module for the 9x, so you can bind it with the mQX and get used to flying with the full size 'real' tranmsmitter<p>4) Get an 'ARF' (almost ready to fly) kit (this should include the frame, ESCs, motors, props, etc), and a flight control board (I'll probably start with something cheap like the Kk 2.0). This is a good time to learn things like ""What is an ESC?"".<p>5) Start modding your ARF quad (replace the ESCs, add a camera, get a more capable flight controller (like the Arducopter), etc)<p>6) Build something from scratch<p>I'm currently on step 3, researching step 4.",1366735829

Add to that the pressure to look good, be in a good shape and dress well.<p>They are bombarded with images of professional women in business attire and women in aprons cooking gourmet meals with children frolicking around. They are constantly struggling to be both these type of women.<p>On the other hand, society and media don't put out so many conflicting images of men. Men have been consistently expected to be bread winners, be successful in their professional life.<p>I am not saying, men don't understand that with a working wife, they have to lend a helping hand at home, but from what I have seen, women end up carrying most of the daily brunt and they feel like they must because of what they see on tv and thousands of years of history.<p>[EDIT: fixed typo]",1366735199

Some are the vast investigative pieces that put the world to rights and might one day win a Pulitzer prize, but others are simply humdrum announcements of new products or services. I'd have thought that a community of founders would appreciate the value engendered by outlets that gather eyeballs for particular sectors and spread the sort of bread and butter news that is press released day in day out by stakeholders in those sectors -- usually after having first removed the hype, dubious claims (""World's first!"") misrepresentation (""A and B have partnered to..."" when it means A has bought/licensed something from B) and fluff (""We are excited to..."", ""This development reaffirms our commitment to..."") that the authors of the press releases have inevitably included.<p>The simple truth is that press releases were not designed for direct consumption by the public, and sites that reproduce them verbatim do nobody any favours. However, in many circumstances several outlets could legitimately run very similar stories based on the same press release, and deliver great value in doing so because they all reach different audiences. Using a press release as a source is not in every case a dirty little secret that needs to be exposed by clever software.<p>Addressing the point made in the parent post, it seems to me there is a bit of a disconnect in assuming that one can take a journalist to lunch, tell him how very clever he is, and then hand him copy-paste text.

So the compliance costs are high because of the thousands of different rates.<p>The proposed legislation sets conditions for the states if they want to have access to the privilege Congress is granting with regard to taxation, one of which is that they must provide <i>free-of-cost</i> software for internet retailers to handle the calculations for their states.<p>> And governments typically levy penalties if you get your sales tax collection wrong. So who is responsible for paying the penalties if the third party tax collection service makes a mistake?<p>If you are the responsible party for collecting the taxes under the law, you pay the government; if you've paid someone else to do it for you, presumably you've made sure the terms of that contract make them responsible to you for any errors they make, so that they pay both the penalties and any additional costs you face as a result of the error.<p>> The way this was supposed to go down is that states were supposed to simplify the number of different tax rates before requiring out-of-state businesses to collect their sales taxes.<p>""Supposed to"" based on what?

We wanted to prevent this potential monopoly. As it turned out, we became the monopoly we tried to prevent.<p>> You arent doing any mining at all?<p>> Nope. Fun fact: none of the Avalon team have their own mining units (outside of test units)... Weve had plenty of opportunities, such as keeping the technology to ourselves and simply mining, but that was never our intention. So how much is that trust worth? We think its worth $5000 by itself. Beyond that, the calculation is based on the current difficulty rate so that break-even point occurs in a month. Which, by the way, as an investment vehicle is a fairly unique proposition. It should be mentioned also that the cost of the batch two was also 75 bitcoins. That the exchange rate has moved is out of our control. And in the end, this was never what we wanted. If we wanted to maximize our profit, we could charge much more. For us, this has always been an ideal-oriented problem, not a business-oriented one. This is one of the primary reasons we arent clearly in the black.

A 9 degree of freedom unit from Sparkfun Electronics [1] is now $125, and reliably resolves 1/4096'th of a G. So I don't doubt that the same engineers at NASA could build what SpaceX is building today, today, but I assure you they didn't have the tools to build it back in the 70's or even in the 90's.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10736"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10736</a>",1366733652

I worked on CUDA code for around a year, and used to understand the landscape pretty well, but if I were to start a high-performance computing project today I'd probably take my lumps and go with OpenCL.  There would be a lot of lumps.<p>Firstly, CUDA is just more mature; there is a very large and well-established set of libraries for a lot of common operations, there is a decent sized community, and Nvidia even produces specialized hardware (Tesla cards) designed just for CUDA.<p>Second, all that generic-ness of OpenCL doesn't come for free.  With Nvidia, you're just working with one architecture; CUDA cards.  Optimizing your kernels is much easier.  OpenCL is just generically parallel, so you could have any sort of crazy heterogeneous high-performance computing environment you have to fiddle with (any number of CPU's with different chipsets and any number of GPU's with different chipsets).<p>I haven't used OpenCL myself, but almost purely anecdotally I have heard many people say that CUDA is often slightly faster[1] and the code is easier to write.<p>TL;DR: CUDA sacrifices flexibility for ease of development and performance gains. OpenCL wants to be everything for everyone, and comes with the typical burdens.<p>[1]: Maybe this is a result of OpenCL being more generic and so harder to optimize.",1366732833

However, when you start your contribution to the thread by insinuating DHH is above reproach, I&#x27;m not filled with sympathy. Especially when his architectural hipsterism is IMHO responsible for ruining a couple microgenerations of developers who learned to code through rails.<p>I can&#x27;t be the first guy who&#x27;s put his head through a wall upon hearing you say persistence is part of the domain. The only time persistence is domain is when your domain is the data store. &quot;But AR <i>is</i> the database&quot;—totally correct. the domain of AR is the database. But that is almost <i></i>never<i></i> the same as your business domain, and trying to mix the two creates a great deal of incidental complexity.",1393912791

(They haven&#x27;t been successful with that one, but they&#x27;re trying).<p>I might get some heat for this but I must say Windows is still the OS with the least closed garden or heck even a garden. To get even the legitimate and popular x86 applications you still have to manually browse to websites and download it. You can install whatever you want whether it has a digital signature or not and yes it also includes the plentitude of crapwares and spywares.<p>>Your interest might be a usable Desktop OS like Win7. Microsoft&#x27;s interest is to ram their touch interface down your throat so that you&#x27;d get used to it.<p>Or maybe some people like a touch OS with their touchscreen laptop and its just MS thinking forward? I don&#x27;t know what other OS can you recommend that is touch friendly for my Surface pro?<p>>You already have NO control. You&#x27;re already paying through other means. You might have had an illusion of control taken away from you - but that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>No sure what you mean by this. I don&#x27;t see MS cloud apps and ads preinstalled on my OS. I don&#x27;t see it being sponsored by Amazon shopping experience either. The only crap that comes pre installed is done by the manufactures but MS can&#x27;t even do anything about it, thanks to the anti-trust decisions.",1393912729

Personally I would like to have following tools to prevent brain-washing:<p>1. Browser plugin(or at least web service)showing &quot;yelowness&quot; of an article and whole site as well. There are some semi-formal attributes of yellow article: exaggerating(e.g. &quot;peaceful protesters&quot; vs &quot;provocateurs&quot;), controversial sources, non-representative opinions(e.g. a crying woman with children speaks for the whole country) etc.<p>2. Some kind of facts graph. While the most yellow media has no links to sources at all, slightly better option is  just quoting source w/out any links(and you have to spend a lot of time to check). Good media have links, but reader have to check them(and source could qoute some controversial and non-representative opinion).

Solving the need has never been an explicit interest in itself.<p>Moving to an advertising based pricing model doesn&#x27;t change any alignment. They still need to fulfill your need or you won&#x27;t use their software which means they won&#x27;t get paid by advertisers.

So x|b means &quot;x, given b&quot;.<p>For these abstract formulations, they are reduced to already-existing calculations..<p>Finally, you get the big sigma symbol.  This is called a Summation.  Summations tend to be able to be approximated using integrals, since an integral is the area under the curve, which is also a summation of sorts.<p>Many integrals can be defined using the &quot;log&quot; function, which has base &quot;e&quot;.  In this case, when you add in &quot;infinity&quot; for the summation, it converges towards 1/e.<p>Hope this helps some.

I had to actually get a WiFi repeater to get everything up and running. Hmm it could have been the amount of UPnP traffic as well. I got about four switches, four plugs, and four motion sensors. Even when I didn&#x27;t poll them with the iOS app, they would just randomly fail to follow their rules or maybe the motion sensors would fail to send messages.<p>Yeah I&#x27;m not keen on spending money for a hub with different radios but I literally just finished packing up all my WeMos today for a return.

A && q does not mean !(!A && !q) as you point out.<p>Around half of !q is owned by foreigners, mostly foreign central banks, so there&#x27;s that. The distribution of the remainder of !q is unclear.<p>Also, note the difference between &quot;benefits&quot; vs. &quot;own&quot; which are not the same. Buying bonds has a variety of effects. Buying a bond from someone benefits the former owner immediately but raising the price of bonds lowers bond yields making buying all new bonds less profitable. It also lowers the cost of financing all government debt, benefiting all taxpayers. But reducing bond yields tends to increase the demand for other assets, such as stocks, increasing the paper value of stocks. Similar story for pushing dollars abroad to foreign bond holders, sending dollars abroad makes the dollar cheaper, boosting exports and hurting imports but reducing market bond yields should do the opposite. But if the market expects inflation from quantitative easing it should reduce the future value of money, increasing bond yields again, but tends to depress stocks but not value stocks as much...<p>Simply put, the claim that buying bonds helps the wealthy is an idea that needs a lot more support than thoughtless one-liners that twang the emotional strings of power and betrayal.",1393912139

For example, the secretaries might be edges in a graph, and you can&#x27;t pick a subset of edges which would result in a cycle (this is a &quot;graphic matroid,&quot; which is an example of a mathematical object known as a matroid). The reason why this  formulation of the problem is interesting is because the best known algorithm is O(sqrt(log k))-competitive (where k is the rank of the matroid), whereas it is conjectured that an O(1)-competitive algorithm exists.",1393911706

With all his harrumphing about real examples, I would have expected him to make an effort to understand a real example.  But, as I said elsewhere, the downside of real examples is that they require quite a bit more effort to grasp than contrived ones.<p>To address your comments:<p>While it is true that one of the great features (and frequent motivations) for using the Command pattern is the separation of the creation and invocation, it is not the only motivation.  The two big payoffs that we are getting are:<p>- Separation of invocation from the knowledge of how it is carried out<p>- Composition of complex commands from smaller, simpler commands<p>There&#x27;s no requirement that the invoker is never the same as the creator. It&#x27;s just that most often it isn&#x27;t, particularly (as you noted) in a worker queue system.  That&#x27;s really just a feature of the implementation that the command readily enables rather than a fundamental property of the pattern.  For us, sometimes it is, sometimes it isn&#x27;t; that&#x27;s not the primary payoff that we&#x27;re going for.<p>I can&#x27;t support the characterization of this as an Adapter.  This is fundamentally behavioral.  I have a class that represents an action that I want to have happen.  All of the places that want this action do not need to know what is involved, they only need to create the command and hand it off/invoke it.<p>FWIW - I have five different places in my software that create an AssignCaseCommand.\n - One controller<p>- Three commands that can create this as a sub command<p>- A utility job<p>Plus that simple concept is available to any custom implementation code that we write.",1393911388

If that’s Google’s investment thesis, it could rationalize an investment in almost any industry. Appliances? Absolutely. Shipping and logistics? You bet. Phosphate mining? OK, maybe not that. But any category of products that have electronics in them is fair game, as are any services that rely on data management. That’s going to be most of the economy. If that’s the case, we’ll need to evaluate Google’s strengths and weaknesses differently.

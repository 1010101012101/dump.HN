You can allege that he would've been just as successful if he hadn't been married during that period, but that's a hard counterfactual to prove, and depends essentially on arguing that his marriage, having kids, etc. provided no support at all that in any way contributed to his success during that period. And if you're going to indulge in <i>those</i> kinds of counterfactuals, then maybe he doesn't deserve his money either, because hey, maybe if he wasn't at PayPal, someone else would've done just a good a job, so he only got his money by essentially having the luck to be ""married"" to PayPal?<p>That's one reason that legally, money made while married is assumed to be evenly split, absent a separate agreement. I don't have any particular insight into his situation, but if, say, my parents had gotten divorced when I was a kid, I would've considered it fair if they split the money evenly, even though my dad officially made all of it.<p>Plus, if you put it the other way, he's keeping 90-95% of their shared wealth, over a billion dollars, and yet is unhappy with that, because he wants <i>more</i>?

I learned what I could of AmigaShell, ARexx,  and AmigaVision, but it was a bit limited. These days, you can be writing C, C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, PHP, Flash/ActionScript and so on for free.<p>In Linux or MacOS, most of these are preinstalled. As far as I know, Windows comes with no programming tools installed, other than a browser,  and that is indeed a major oversight.",1277183859

Also, this is neither a personal attack on irrelevant facets of him, nor is it just about TCO.<p>Python has done very well in its history and I personally like it. However, Guido made his final decision literally days after learning the distinction. This means before that any decisions he made in this area were based on shaky information. Furthermore, he was initially informed by comments on his blog, not his own research. I'm worried what this means for future decisions in Python if Guido doesn't research something on his own before making decisions on it. I understand that he's busy, but working of Python is part of that and surely research should be included :).",1277183561

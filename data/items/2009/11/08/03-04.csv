928755,comment,928429,928667,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"What requires that your hands be ""square to the keys""? I'm typing now and my fingers are a angle relative to the orientation of the square keys, yet that doesn't stand in the way of my typing. Yes, my smaller fingers are curled slightly more than my index and middle finger but that's not a huge insult to my physiognomy. The human body is actually pretty flexible but moreover, since our fingers are different lengths, it's hard to say there is a ""perfect"" place on the keyboard for them. Of course, for true alignment, one would want to have one's hand's palm upward but that's not going to happen with current input devices so compromises of one sort or another are necessary.",1257651420
928754,comment,928563,928683,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""Fighting the compiler"" doesn't necessarily mean type errors.  It could mean that you have to warp your design to fit the constraints of a language, often making much more extensive changes to your program than you would otherwise would've had to.<p>Though a lot of my complaints about Haskell's type system could be alleviated with a good integrated refactoring tool.  If I had one-command operations to:<p>a.) Convert a plain function to a monadic one<p>b.) Change the signature and stacking order of a large stack of monadic transformers<p>c.) Add a new alternative to an algebraic data type, and track down and fix all functions that use it.<p>d.) Add a new parameter, at an arbitrary position, to a function.<p>e.) Change a straight return value to a Maybe.<p>f.) Add a new field to a record or tuple type.<p>Then I'd find Haskell's type system much less oppressive.  What's the status of Leksah these days?",1257651352

I'm not sure if it fully accounts for selection bias, but it seems to be a better basis for comparison.<p>In terms of show stopping problems, Karmic is currently about the same as Jaunty with about 32% of people reporting they couldn't work around their issues, while for Intrepid it was 45%.<p>I can imagine there's selection bias at that level as well - the people who can't work around problems for one release aren't going to be involved in the poll for the next release.<p>Anecdotally, everyone that I've convinced to try Ubuntu has been badly burnt by upgrade issues - only my girlfriend has continued to use it since I do the upgrades for her.

You make a buggy software product someone finds a way to exploit automatically and when your customers come calling asking for help to repair their systems, suddenly, you are not to be blamed? Not even a little? How so?<p>Let's move the example from software to aerospace.<p>Someone builds planes that, when an engine inhales a bird, explode, killing all passengers and crew. They do not know the problem exists and did as little testing as required by regulations. Knowing the problem, a kid decides to release pigeons in the path of the plane, creating a quite spectacular accident. Who will you blame? Just the kid, just the manufacturer or both?<p>Until executive bonuses get cut, you will see no improvement over there. Unfortunately, lots of bonuses get calculated on limited scopes and don't reflect the complete lifetime of a product. This way, it's easy to close sales, pocket huge bonuses right now, get promoted, and to let the support cost bomb explode in the hands of your successor while you capitalize on your success and head up the corporate ladder.<p>If you look them closely, big corporations are rarely more intelligent than a sponge or a coral reef.",1257650688

928743,comment,924943,924943,0,0,apsec112,,,"""It’s easy to “design” when you’re unencumbered by things like metrics, creative direction, business acumen, sales experience, actual functionality, enterprise scale, or any thought about how a site with millions of page views and users has to function.""<p>Wait... what? None of this makes much sense at all.<p>""Metrics""? Metrics for what? A metric is just a way of measuring things. What are we measuring? Pixels? Number of visitors? Number of bytes transferred?<p>""Creative direction""? Again, what does that mean, exactly? It's an airline website. It's supposed to be elegant and functional, not a work of postmodernist art.<p>""Business acumen""? Business = getting people to pay you, and people will be more inclined to pay you, all other things being equal, if your website is better designed. Is there some reason why a website redesign would cause AA to <i>lose</i> money? The cost of designing a website is trivial, in comparison to AA's annual budget of $22,935,000,000.<p>""Sales experience""? ""Sales"" usually means selling things to people in person, or over the phone, which is a very different business from designing a website to sell people things (ask anyone who's done both).<p>""Actual functionality"" is the only legitimate criticism here. It's quite a bit harder to make a website that actually works than to draw it.<p>""Enterprise scale"" is a myth. Justin.TV, according to their website, currently has 29 employees (including the founders). Justin.TV's Alexa rank is #222. American Airlines has 85,500 employees, and their website is <i>less</i> popular (rank #1,465), and almost certainly requires less bandwidth and storage space to boot.<p>I won't comment on whether the guy is or isn't a jerk, but the ability to spit out a long list of fancy words (""metrics""? Come on) does not a legitimate criticism make.",1257650630

A more powerful government can keep us safer. If it can do it cheaply, so much the better.</i><p>First, ""most people view this as a good thing"" is clearly an appeal to popularity, which is a fallacious reasoning. At one time, most people believed slavery was a good thing. Discuss.<p>""A more powerful government can keep us safer."" The word ""can"" is a weasel-word. We are not debating whether the government ""can"" do something, we are debating whether they actually do something. I challenge you to strengthen your statement by claiming that the increase in power given to the government is <i>actually</i> keeping us safer.<p>""if it can do it cheaply, so much the better."" Hanging around startups, I have become enamoured of the idea that when certain things become extremely cheap, the entire dynamic changes. Radio car phones existed when I was a teen-ager. Then analog cell-phones, then digital cell-phones. Each new wave of technology was cheaper than the previous one. At some point, untethered phones became so cheap that the entire dynamic around telephony changed, and it changed very quickly.<p>Getting back to cheap spying on people, if you like what they are doing, then doing it cheaper seems to be a good thing. But at some point, it becomes so cheap that the entire dynamic changes. For example, if these devices were so cheap that they could be disposable, why not spy on everyone, all of the time?<p>This completely changes the dynamic of law enforcement. You don't start with a person suspected of breaking the law and spy on them, you simply spy on everyone and save everything. When and if you become interested in someone, you open up their file and voila! All of their movements since they bought their first car, all of their rental car movements, all of the movements of everyone who knew them and might have given them a ride, going back decades.<p>I need a bit more meat to the assertion that this scenario is ""so much the better"" before I will accept it.",1304963269

However, tracking, by itself, does not negatively impact the life of the person being tracked. Most are completely unaware of it, and those that are aware that they are being tracked have nothing to complain about: there is no expectation of privacy while traveling on public roads.

And yet, when issues such as increased surveillance arise, everyone is (mostly rightly) alarmed at the increase in power this could provide to the government.  Cries of ""1984"" are an internet staple.  But rather than only insisting that this new capability be denied to our government, I wish people would also question whether it is really a fundamental truth that government cannot be trusted with such capabilities or whether it's possibly just our current forms of government that cannot.<p>Just in case it's not obvious why we'd want a government spying on us, I'll briefly make the case.   There might be some side benefit, such as automatically identifying emergency situations, but realistically the main benefit comes from increased effectiveness of law enforcement.  Yes, that ought to be a benefit.  If it isn't, that points to a problem with the laws or the way they're enforced.  Increasing the effectiveness with which we can identify violations will not only lead to a reduction in violations, but will also let us lower punishments (speeding tickets would work fine at $10 each if every speeder were cited, etc).<p>Some people will argue that such a government could never exist.  ""Who watches the watchers?"", the cliche goes.  Well, why couldn't the answer be ""other watchers""?  Isn't that the idea of checks and balances?  I don't think that there's much chance of a sufficiently better form of government emerging from our current political machine anytime soon, but if it were to happen it wouldn't be accomplished by getting everyone to agree on the details, many of which I probably imagine wrong myself.  Rather, I think it would be accomplished by making the very idea of a better system of government popular, and getting people to agree on a transparent process and criteria for working out the details.  (Well, there might be other ways.  If someone posted instructions for a relatively easy to make, low cost nuclear bomb to the internet I think that, after a few detonations, we'd have mass internment that would give everyone ample free time to discuss whether a surveillance state is really necessarily bad.)",1304962317

I find the argument inappropriately personal -- focusing as it does on the virtue and piety of the person.  But mainly I find it . . . well, myopic.  Near-sighted.<p>Take the outsourcing we're discussing.  The suffering of the fellow who loses his job and maybe his house and has to move back in with his parents is one piece of the equation.  The other piece is his counterpart in China who lives in worse conditions, and wants to work hard to improve life for him and his family, but lacks the opportunity.<p>And then there's the cheaper product itself.  There's the company that makes more money, which affects its shareholders and stock prices, which in aggregate affects people's retirement accounts.  Perhaps one of <i>them</i> is in danger of losing a house?  And then there are the customers, who can now afford the cheaper product, or who can afford more other things because it <i>is</i> cheaper.  Perhaps one of <i>them</i> is in a tight situation, too?<p>And that doesn't even include tertiary effects.  Perhaps this cheaper product is used as a component for something else new.  Perhaps a whole new technology becomes feasible now.  Perhaps it changes the <i>world</i>.  Where does <i>that</i> fit in the equation?<p>That's why the argument strikes me as myopic.  Our notional blue collar worker may indeed <i>be</i> miserable, but who is to say his misery outweighs everyone else's?  Why is he special?  In fact, I find the reasoning to be kind of . . . maybe not exactly racist, but kind of people-ist in some way or another.  I'm sorry for the guy, but I don't feel his concerns ought to trump anyone else's.<p>I'm not saying you shouldn't try to figure out the impact of decisions on people at large.  But I am definitely saying to have respect for how incalculable it can be, and to at least think in terms of all the people you can see right off will be affected -- and not just one class of them.<p>I'm also saying to use the right tool for the job.  As a rule of thumb, I like industry to make <i>progress</i>, and charity to <i>relieve suffering</i>.  Not that there aren't exceptions -- I myself am advocating the establishment of industry in a region as a way to improve conditions, and I certainly see the value of non-profit research.<p>But usually I don't want the wires crossed.  If you're worried about the suffering of folks who have lost jobs and are having trouble making ends meet, the right approach seems to me to start or assist a foundation that helps those sorts of folks financially and educationally (or whatever).  Limiting the help to, say, textile manufacturing workers, and having the help come in the form of keeping their jobs at the expense of jobs for folks in other regions, and ignoring an economic opportunity and possibly retarding progress in general . . .<p>. . . well, that seems to me really inefficient.

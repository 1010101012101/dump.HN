Certainly, that's not true from C++ when you need to figure out lifetime issues, etc It may be possible to figure out from the source code, if the code is written well enough, but that's true independently of the language IMO. Developer not writing decent doc is an institutional problem, and if this cannot be enforced, then the institution is most likely not capable of producing very good code either.<p>I think it is more interesting to talk from the POV of how to write code that is actually readable: type may help, but that's only a not that important part of the equation in my experience.",1329029831

That's not to say Tcl/Tk didn't have areas where it would shine brightly back in the day.  Those would be Expect and Tk. When you needed to 'automate' accessing hosts or devices via telnet, Expect could do that and then some.  And Tk was probably the easiest way to create a GUI on the fly for unix and linux.  I know that most of the management and configuration apps for UnixWare 2 and 7 were written in visual tcl, a curses enhanced version of tcl, which made dealing with UnixWare less painful.<p>Unfortunately, there aren't really any big killer apps written with tcl, and I haven't seen any major new books (a 2nd edition of Ousterhout's book and one or two others).

You seem more interested in throwing as many weasel words and colorful, fear-mongering imagery into your comments than actual commentary. Are you writing ""1984"" or are we talking about the article?<p>Let's dive into the article first, though, and list out some <i>verifiable, specific</i> claims being made:<p>- Hsu's family is the actual senior management, despite not holding any officially recognized position.<p>- The unofficial/family senior management sequestered themselves in an office inaccessible to other employees, and in fact acted so collectively that there was a single email address to reach all of them.<p>- Employees were forced to commit to 9-6pm quiet hours. Promised breaks of this silent period were not honored.<p>- Some employees were forced to give lengthy debriefings at the end of the day to senior management, keeping them at the office until 9-10pm.<p>- The expectation from senior management is to work 6-7 day weeks.<p>- Management actively discouraged documentation of complaints.<p>- Management told employees to not speak to ex-employees.<p>These are concrete claims that the founder and startup can refute definitively. These are also factual findings that one can discover interviewing past and current employees. This is a long way from making vague, non-specific accusations about a company.<p>So much for your ""the claims are neither specific nor verifiable"".<p>You also seem to be making a <i>lot</i> of assumptions about myself and others who have commented in this thread. You accuse us all of ""taking smug delight in the bruising... of another person"", and likened people commenting on this article to Roman gladiatorial spectators.<p>As an Asian I'd rather that these accusations <i>not</i> be true, since they inevitably raise stereotypes that I have to live with every day, and I certainly do not want people to check my office for my parents when I do business in the future. Far from taking schadenfreude in these accusations, these sadden me, and if they pan out to be true, will mean a genuine step back for Asian founders.<p>And yet, if these accusations are true, they deserve to be aired. The bruising of one's reputation is entirely deserved if the claims being leveled are true.<p>You have an <i>incredibly</i> wide definition of the word ""vigilantism"", and I suggest you look into its historical uses before trying to weasel that word into anything where any group takes any action against anyone.",1329028907

Inheritance makes you <i>want</i> to glue unrelated things together.<p>Inheritance views the world as fundamentally hierarchical; you can divide things up into branches of a tree.  A node on the tree either has all of a set of functions or none of them.  Any code you put into Reptile will <i>never</i> be needed by a Mammal, and will <i>never</i> be inappropriate for an object that needs other things in Reptile.<p>But of course, that's unrealistic.  Where would you put swim()?  Where would you put fly()?  Code reuse can't always be decomposed into a tree.  And in an inheritance paradigm, you get ugly workarounds in that case -- cut and pasted code, nasty multiple inheritance hacks, or util classes.  All bad things.<p>What you want are things coupled, not by convenient proximity in current function, but by logical relationship.  You want a class that has swimming-related code <i>and nothing else</i>, that any swimmer can use without preconceptions about whether it's a Reptile or a Mammal.

This isn't meticulously researched.  This is not a 60 Minutes expos.  Did Anthony do any fact checking?  Did he spend time researching the company and verifying these people's stories?<p>No, he wrote an article in the Fox News style.  Who needs fact-checking when you can just get people from two opposing camps to contradict each other?<p>It was gossip.  It worked.

3581232,comment,3579626,3581142,1,0,azakai,,,"> As for the mobile web... even my WebKit Android browser fails often, even on this very text field. There is no single 'webkit for mobile', and it's all the non-iPhone users that are treated as second class citizens, webkit prefixes or not. That's IMO a very different problem.<p>It's the same problem, and it's just as bad: If there is one dominant implementation, and other browsers can't render the actual web even when they implement the relevant standards - then the web is broken. If it's WebKit vs the rest or iOS vs the rest, it's just as bad.<p>Regarding your frustration on the Mozilla bug tracker, I've definitely felt that both there and basically on every other major bug tracker. The other day I filed a bug on Node.js, and in 15 minutes there were three responses, saying things like ""why is this a bug in node?"", ""don't file bugs on node like this"", and soon after the bug was closed. A few days later, it was confirmed as valid... that's how it goes in big bug trackers ;)<p>> Ultimately it all comes down to opinion and perception. But I have a hard time finding people who are still excited about Firefox who aren't Mozillians.<p>I have very much the opposite impression, we probably just visit different websites and communities.",1329026471

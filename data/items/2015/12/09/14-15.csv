Not diacetyl specifically.<p>>Even 100x the amount of diacetyl as e-juice is apparently not enough to cause the &quot;Popcorn Lung&quot; issue related to the compound specifically. So why would 100x less than the amount that does not cause it suddenly start to cause it? Not that it&#x27;s 100 percent safe (As mentioned by a replier as well- So I have appended my post some for accuracy and fairness.) Just that it&#x27;s not the immediate or unavoidable threat it&#x27;s being presented as.<p>>And in the span of 7+ years even in the heaviest vape users no one has (yet, mind. For the sake of fairness and caution.) reported any major health issues tied to vaping or the compounds contained in e-juice. If the 75ml a day heavy diactyl juice user doesn&#x27;t get popcorn lung then I highly doubt popcorn lung is a problem to watch for regarding it.<p>>Also there are many many e-juices available without diactyl. So even if it was an issue you can actively avoid it. And most manufacturers have discontinued it&#x27;s use or clearely state if their juices are diacetyl free so the risk factors that are purely tied to diacetyl are avoidable and preventable.<p>>As far as being paranoid about what&#x27;s put in it- This is purely my opinion but, I think that is razorblades in your kid&#x27;s halloween candy or &quot;Shadey people handing out drugs for free/Lacing your kid&#x27;s flintstones vitamins with PCP&quot; levels of unfounded overconcern.<p>>Caution is important- But so is research and fact checking.<p>>Edit: To append this to- I am not defending the use or previous use of the substance, merely dispelling the immediate &quot;Popcorn Lung&quot; panic around it. I personally don&#x27;t use e-juice containing it for the sake of risk reduction in general as I like to limit as many potential factors as possible in general. And there are hundreds- if not thousands of brands and types which do not contain diacetyl to choose from which I would recommend.<p>>I am also not claiming vaping is 100 percent safe- Just that this instance is an avoidable factor and has been for a while.<p>>Personal safety and active research should always be practiced in all facets of life.<p>[1] <a href=""https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3vxbzo/chemical_flavorings_found_in_ecigarettes_linked/cxrq6ro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3vxbzo/chemical_fla...</a><p>Edit: For the record, that is not my Reddit post.

I&#x27;m one of those ops people, and the number of package managers needed to deploy any web application is just insane.  The biggest problem is that none of them can specify the full dependency graph for anything.  For example, the Pg Ruby gem cannot specify that it requires the libpq shared library and headers.  You have to either know that before hand, or watch the package installation fail, find the right package in your system package manager, then try again.  They are also bad at deduplicating dependencies amongst many projects, but at least they allow installation as an unprivileged user.  How many more <i>pm and </i>vm (version manager) tools must we deal with?  I wish more people would realize that this is a general problem that requires a general solution.<p>Traditional system package managers are also terrible.  They install everything into the global /usr directory so that you can&#x27;t have differing sets of depdencies for different software and they require root access because /usr is only writeable by root.  Because of these severe limitations and without effort being put in to fix it, I think GNU/Linux distributions have helped push everyone towards using a new package manager per language so that people can get their work done.<p>The solution to all of these problems is functional package management.  They take the good parts of both system and language-specific package managers and add even more features and improvements on top.  Functional package managers can handle software written in any language, allow unprivileged package installation, and allow different packages to depend on different versions of the same software without issue.  They have additional features such as transactional upgrades and rollbacks, and system-wide deduplication.  The <i>entire</i> dependency graph is precisely captured, all the way down to a small set of bootstrap binaries that are the roots of the graph.  The GNU Guix [0] and Nix[1] projects implement the functional package management paradigm, and they are both worth taking a serious look at.  In addition to standard package management features, they also can do full-system configuration management with their respective distributions GuixSD and NixOS.<p>[0] <a href=""http://gnu.org/s/guix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnu.org/s/guix</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://nixos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nixos.org/</a>",1449671174

I would argue that &quot;self-driving&quot; is just a feature of an automobile; the expensive part is building and delivering a half-ton hunk of precision-engineered metal. People were buying cars long before they were self-driving; and I doubt that self-driving will add a whole lot to the cost of a vehicle. Even then, the hard part of building a business around autonomous cars is obtaining safety certification and improving public perception of autonomous driving. All the major self-driving algorithms will be largely public domain before that happens.<p>Likewise with Google; there were search engines long before Google. Hell, Google first appeared as the search technology powering Yahoo! long before they had their own presence. Granted; in this case ML enabled the &quot;killer app&quot; of generating relevant results and allowing ad targeting, but use cases where ML is as critical to the product as Google are rare. More typical are things like Netflix&#x27;s recommendation engine - the value of the service is in the video library, the recommendation engine is just another avenue for content discovery. It is also being increasingly curated as opposed to automated for promotional reasons.<p>All of this matters. ML is great, but ML results are often so narrowly scoped that you need to identify your product scope first, then find an ML solution that helps. And even then, at small scale you can often &quot;fake&quot; the impact of ML via manual labor or &quot;doing things that don&#x27;t scale&quot; (i.e. operating the service via manual labor at a loss with the hopes of adding an AI component to handle that function later in a scalable fashion). If the product doesn&#x27;t resonate with the market, all the ML in the world won&#x27;t help it succeed.",1449670936

And thats why I said Plasma Mobile is most interesting, since its not for commercial purposes where success is measured in adoption. The Nexus phones and other devices that are rarely commercially available in stores sell fractions of the units that generic LG and Samsung phones on those shelves do. You can make a business selling a good Android phone out there, but for a mobile OS that needs a good chunk of market share to stay viable, limiting yourself to those seeking you out puts you at an insurmountable disadvantage to getting a foothold large enough to attract developers.",1449670196

If you ask a Chinese person to describe a fish tank, the Chinese will usually describe the context in which the fish swim.&quot;<p>The study: (1) Not a real fish tank but short animated vignettes. (2) All the fish were the same size, so anything Brooks says about &quot;the biggest fish&quot; can&#x27;t possibly apply. (3) The only &quot;context within which the fish swim&quot; was provided by the other fish. (4) The experimental subjects were not &quot;asked to describe a fish tank&quot;. They were asked specific questions like &quot;To what extent do the blue fish&#x27;s movements seem influenced by the other fish?&quot;. (5) The differences were not about whether experimental subjects described one particular fish or the context in which the fish swim. (6) The differences found were far smaller than &quot;Americans usually do X, Chinese people usually do Y&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the biggest effect they found: they asked &quot;To what extent do the blue fish&#x27;s movements seem influenced by internal factors?&quot; and took answers on a scale from 1 to 5: 1 = hardly at all, 2 = slightly, 3 = moderately, 4 = greatly, 5 = almost entirely. In one category of cartoons, which the experimenters term &quot;compulsion&quot;, American high-schoolers gave an average answer of 3.17 and Chinese high-schoolers an average answer of 2.56. Second-biggest effect: same cartoons, but now asking &quot;To what extent do the blue fish&#x27;s movements seem influenced by the other fish?&quot;. American: 3.27. Chinese: 3.61.<p>These, I repeat, were much the largest effects found by the study among the several cases into which they subdivided their findings. For grad students looking at the same category of cartoons, the answers were 3.07 for the Americans and 3.00 for the Chinese (first question) and 3.77/3.82 (second question). Most of the differences they found were of this sort of size, and some of them were in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction.<p>If you think this study supports Brooks&#x27;s statement about what happens when Chinese and American people look at fish tanks ... well, I really don&#x27;t know what to say. It&#x27;s not even addressing the right question to support (or refute) Brooks&#x27;s statement, and in any case the results are far weaker than Brooks implies.",1449670009

Barring concrete physiological evidence, innateness is simply an unfalsifiable position. I do think you can say that consensus among scientists might have shifted against innateness, but that is definitely not because of some computational model such as RNN with some passing resemblance to observed behavior of human neurons. The way these networks are configured and trained has nothing to do with real brains, nor does the abstraction in neural nets leave room for any electrochemical effects.<p>> The interesting question is why RNNs are able to produce things that resemble formal languages at first pass.<p>Is it? A neural network can achieve that by simulating a Turing machine or simpler automaton. I don&#x27;t see what that brings to the table?

I was an extremely heavy user before that. I can say for sure that leaving facebook has made me objectively happier and less sadder.<p>I remember that XKCD comic about social network effects. Our minds are &#x27;trained&#x27; to &#x27;compare&#x27; ourselves with 10-15 of our friends, and assert that we lie around the &#x27;average&#x27;. When we look at facebook, where everyone puts on their best (and in the hundreds) our brains &#x27;think&#x27; we&#x27;re doing a lot worse than the average, and we feel bad about ourselves. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people talk about not comparing to people on facebook, but... you really can&#x27;t help it.<p>Full Disclosure: I opened a different facebook account. JUST for family, because my mom didn&#x27;t _believe_ that I didn&#x27;t have a facebook. I open it maybe once in a couple of weeks, and have gone for many months without logging in.<p>Here&#x27;s something I&#x27;d tell to other people: if you feel depressed after using facebook, delete it. Forget about &#x27;not keeping in touch&#x27;, &#x27;being a loner&#x27;, etcetera. Your mental health is way, way, wayyy more important than knowing what your freaking high school acquaintance&#x27;s third child had for lunch on a random day. Have a small group of close friends, and call them, hang out with them. Your larger group of friends will always be yours. If you <i>need</i> social networking, get snapchat (I&#x27;m a critic turned fanboy). It&#x27;s fleeting, so you don&#x27;t feel as bad about yourself, and people are not as annoying.<p>Addendum:\n Here&#x27;s how people make non-FB friends. A friend of a friend wanted help with grad schools, so I agreed to talk to her. We chatted on Skype (second encounter, EVER), and we ended up talking for an hour. She wanted someone to talk to and asked if we could talk again soon, and I didn&#x27;t mind one more friend so we&#x27;re skyping again soon. You make friends out of nowhere; don&#x27;t need facebook for that. Facebook gives you the illusion you&#x27;re &#x27;in-touch&#x27; with everyone, when all you&#x27;re doing is gathering &#x27;intelligence&#x27; on their lives.",1449669773

I tried to show them some basic Ruby to ask them questions on the command line that they could answer (thinking that if I could emulate a social aspect of computers they might become interested).<p>Nothing I tried worked.<p>I talked one daughter into taking the AP Comp Sci class in high school this year because I assured her that I would be able to coach her through any problems.  The summer before the class, I did my best to start going over basic concepts that she would cover in class - just so she could hit the ground running... she adamantly refused to waste her summer on that subject.<p>Meanwhile, a neighbor of mine called me because his son had taken up programming their home computer on his own and wanted some advice on languages and projects to pursue.",1449669710

It&#x27;s not because of a lack of understanding on it&#x27;s mechanics.<p>> From this point of view, there is no &quot;travesty&quot; to thank marketing for. The reality was that probably personal computers were more appealing to men, so it made more sense to spend marketing resources towards them. Why it was more appealing to them is a good question to ask, and it could be because of many reasons, including culture and society. But marketing probably didn&#x27;t create that desire, it just used it.<p>Marketing is <i>absolutely</i> about the manufacture of desire. Though above you make the connection between Coca-cola and the harmless association of this beverage to &quot;happiness&quot;, this is over-simplifying things somewhat. The psychology of the brand, upon which modern consumer society is dependent, and which marketing ruthlessly exploits, is based around the construction of a self solely through conspicuous acts of consumption rather than through human experiences, relationships with friends and family, or other pursuits traditionally considered to be more laudable.<p>Though arguably it is required in keeping the wheels of capitalism spinning (and by proxy food in our bellies); in reality, marketing is the process of co-opting, subverting, and ultimately extinguishing joy and the human experience.",1449669701

One is a solid boring industry with a long history of stable growth and of turning small but consistent profits.  The other is in a smaller niche industry, showing impressive growth numbers, but yet to make a profit.  As in investor it is hard to value such a company.  Will the large old slow growing part hold back the new fast growing part?  Will the losses in the smaller division lower the potential dividends of the solid part of the company? By splitting out the parts you can appeal both to investors who like low volatility and reliable dividend payments and to investors whom are willing to accept huge risk in exchange for the chance of 10x returns.",1449669677

I came here specifically because of startups. At the time (HN was new), people who participated were supposed to be better-known by the YC folks and have a better chance of getting into YC.<p>Not only did I not get into YC, the conversation quickly became &quot;stuff that hackers like&quot;. Folks got tired of marketing, business models, coding, and other detailed startup stuff. Startup stuff became less about &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m doing X, how does Y work?&quot; and more about celebrity bloggers. Then MSM posts, then the rags, and so forth.<p>Now it&#x27;s like a reddit-lite. I&#x27;m not complaining, just pointing out that yes, there has been a big drift from where it started to where it is today.<p>And if anybody knows where the new HN is, please email me.

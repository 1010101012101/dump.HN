The idea I tried was creating an interface to update multiple services (twitter, flickr, delicious ...) via one page, send to a database and use the api's to auto-update. The hard bits ...<p>- how do you add more services easily?<p>- how will your display code handle lots of empty fields? Lots of conditionals in your templates. Is your templating engine up to it?<p>- how do you selectively and easily send data to one application but not another, some times? Can you change for instance sending links to flickr but not to delicious on a one time basis?<p>- how do you handle sites that have no API's or feeds? Like hackernews which had neither for a long time.<p>The one key advantage of this method is you capture data before you propagate it. So if your well thought out 100 word post (with references) dies because your browser crashes or you press the back button you have a local copy.",1221569399

305710,comment,305349,305527,0,0,tptacek,,,"Yeah, I think this is a bit naive. Of the three SQLi cases I mentioned, only the first is due to the app language's handling of string input and query strings, and that case is just as easily handled by parameterized queries.<p>The second case is not due to the fact that the same type is used for input and query strings; when a web app passes DESC or ASC or LIMIT 100 in via POST arguments, that's a design problem type systems don't solve.<p>Likewise, type systems might fix the simplest XSS problems, but the nasty ones occur in code that is explicitly trying to handle input that has been laundered through the database and must include HTML characters.",1221568525

Glory and vanity plays a large part especially for high net-worth individuals. Fear too, for attaining some type of status amongst one's peers. Startups are no different in that respect.

We had a great conversation and at one point he described a specific problem he's dealing with and the sort of solution he'd be interested in.<p>I made a fairly crude but functional demo using open source stuff (took about a day) to show the guy and he liked what he saw.

If your app creates and destroys a lot of objects, that&#x27;s a big deal.&quot; [1]<p>One example: in 64bit NSNumber and (short) NSString objects on iOS can be stored completely in a pointer (tagged pointers) on the stack without having to create anything on the heap. That&#x27;s possible because the size of a 64bit pointer is large enough to contain the required information. Creating and accessing one of these objects becomes far faster. Based on what I gathered at WWDC this year, Apple is also inclined to move as many various objects there as possible (as long as they can be stored in a 64 bit pointer).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-and-you.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-an...</a>",1407829179

The Lyft drivers I have talked to in SF say they make $30 an hour at a minimum, which I assume is after subtracting fuel costs but not factoring in automobile depreciation and maintenance costs.

Therefore it&#x27;s &quot;not leaving anything on the table&quot;.<p>Not sure why I&#x27;m being downvoted:<p>> <i>The big paradigm-shift that ART brings, is that instead of being a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler, it now compiles application code Ahead-of-Time (AOT). The runtime goes from having to compile from bytecode to native code each time you run an application, to having it to do it only once, and any subsequent execution from that point forward is done from the existing compiled native code.</i><p><a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/8231/a-closer-look-at-android-runtime-art-in-android-l"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/8231/a-closer-look-at-android-...</a><p>That sounds like native code compilation to me.",1407827639

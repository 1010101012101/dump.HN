You know - Marriage.<p>So, this is not about religion (really this is from a country where most people under 60 attending church are doing so they can get their kids into the associated school) - it&#x27;s not about the tax laws, it&#x27;s about what society sees, expects and hands out to a married couple.<p>It makes a difference - there is a difference between a couple who are &quot;to all intents and purposes&quot; married and a couple who are married.  Because for the 95% straight relationships out there we read something into why that couple has not gotten married.  And we are then forced to read the same into a gay couple.

You, or any other religious group, can have whatever prohibitions you believe in your own lives, homes and churches. Different groups can have different prohibitions. However, they must therefore be kept separate and out of the public law and state, because that space can only accomodate one or zero religions. The US constitution specifies zero: no establishment of religion. This enforces a ceasefire between the doctrines that would otherwise fight to be the one doctrine that has control of the state, as Europe experienced during the Reformation and Islam is experiencing in the Sunni-Shia conflict.<p>For decades if not longer it was non-straight people who were deemed unworthy and not allowed freedom from persecution by the religious supermajority.

You believe that I should be able to &quot;connect the dots&quot; in the same way that you do, but when there are so few dots, it&#x27;s easy for one person to see Ursa Major, another a dipper, and a third a plow.<p>My entire point is that your data points are too vague and have multiple reasonable interpretations, and that it&#x27;s possible to make it more rigorous.<p>You did not specify what &quot;mythologize&quot; means. I interpreted it mean &quot;the subject of a biopic&quot; produced by a movie studio for the big screen. You give a dictionary definition, but that doesn&#x27;t define what it means to &#x27;mythologize&#x27; someone in a movie, or determine if some group is excessively or under-mythologized. Is a biopic about Plato mythologizing Plato? Which groups do or don&#x27;t need mythologization? Are British biopics over or under represented?<p>You believe that a movie about the Nobel Peace Prize winner Joseph Rotblat is likely about to &quot;pass judgement on all the other guys who didn&#x27;t leave the Manhattan Project&quot; and not about the events that lead to his getting the Peace Prize. I have just watched the film, and it does not do what you pessimistically assumed.<p>You believe that a movie about research which is usually interpreted as a caution against the implicit acceptance of authoritarian roles, is actually about research about the &quot;the horrible things this white guy did to people&quot;.<p>(You write about Milgram&#x27;s &#x27;inhumane experiments&#x27;. While he worked to understand why humans might do things that are inhumane, the people being &quot;shocked&quot; were actors. It was emotionally stressful, certainly, though as <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346260/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4346260/</a> comments, &quot;Milgram invoked post-experimental survey data and psychiatrists’ reports to demonstrate that most participants were glad to have participated and that none had been harmed&quot;. It adds careful qualifiers to that interpretation. What part of his experiments do you consider to be &#x27;inhumane&#x27;?)<p>And you don&#x27;t like moves that are well-regarded by those in the social justice movement. Nor, if I understand your objection to &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot;, is a film acceptable if it has a female actor on the movie poster, even though your original criteria asked about &quot;the regular white guy scientists .. we&#x27;ve mythologized&quot;, and not movies which <i>only</i> mythologize regular white male scientists. This feels very might like raising the goal posts.<p>Again, this is acceptable. You get to define your own coding criteria, so long as it&#x27;s transparent enough that others can have a hope of reproducing it.<p>It does mean that &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964), which is about white men bringing nuclear destruction to the world, where one of the main characters is handicapped, and is well-loved by the anti-war crowd, is an example of movie that you think puts straight white males in a bad light. &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot;, and &quot;1984&quot; all portray white men in oppressive positions of power. As reactions to authoritarianism is the topic of Milgram&#x27;s work, these also seem to fall into your pattern.<p>Again, perfectly acceptable. Once you define your criteria, it can be applied more rigorously against a longer period of time, to see if there&#x27;s a trend.<p>Of course, it ends up with strange problems, where &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot;, which has the Indian character Khan Noonien Singh (played by the Mexican actor Ricardo Montalbán) on the movie poster, so doesn&#x27;t count as a white, straight, male movie. Ghostbusters II (1989) has a black man on the movie poster. Tony Stark in the &quot;Iron Man&quot; films has a chest injury which requires him to wear a regulator for his heart, so is handicapped. &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) also had a woman on the movie poster.<p>As &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and these examples show, this &quot;pattern&quot; you&#x27;ve identified, of sometimes having non-white, non-male, non-straight, or handicapped actors, has been around for a long time. It&#x27;s not clear that it&#x27;s a new thing, and seems to match the secular trend since the 1960s of letting people besides white, straight men have the positions of power in US politics, science, and other fields.<p>You said &quot;I was hoping you would notice from context I was referencing male scientists who were publicly disgraced as people, not as fraudulent scientists.&quot;, in regards to &quot;publicly disgraced in the past year (offhand I can think of 3)&quot;.<p>I believe you are limiting the topic to people who have not been disgraced for scientific reasons but because of other events in their lives. That is, despite that some of the disgraced people I mentioned committed no crime, their social ostracism isn&#x27;t the right kind of social ostracism for you. I presume the only criteria you accept is that the person must be criticized for racist, sexist, or similar reasons?<p>With that qualifier in mind, I assume you mean Watson, Taylor, and Hunt. Do note that Watson has been disgraced &quot;as a person&quot; for years for his racist and sexist views.<p>For example, in <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fury-at-dna-pioneers-theory-africans-are-less-intelligent-than-westerners-394898.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fury-at-dna-pionee...</a> from 2007 titled &quot;Fury at DNA pioneer&#x27;s theory: Africans are less intelligent than Westerners&quot; and subtitled &quot;Celebrated scientist attacked for race comments: &quot;All our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really&quot;. This caused people to, for example, cancel his visit (<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7050020.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7050020.st...</a>) and &quot;Because of the public controversy, on 18 October 2007, the Board of Trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory suspended Watson&#x27;s administrative responsibilities.&quot; Indeed, the reason why he sold his Nobel Prize last year was to make money, <i>because</i> he had been ostracized for years, and wanted the money.<p>Thus, only two of those have happened this year, and not the three you suggested. Or are you thinking of someone else? If so, who?<p>Other similarly <i>personally</i> disgraced scientists include Kary Mullis, Nobel Prize winner and well known HIV/AIDS denialist, climate change denialist, and believer in astrology; and William Shockley, a Nobel Prize winner also known for his racist views and support for eugenics.<p>Of course there have been few women who have won the Nobel Prize, so with only 4 examples of male Nobel Prize winners ostracized for their views, we would not expect there to be a female winner similarly ostracized. Thus, lack of such a counter-examples is completely expected from the statistics.<p>Since you include astronauts as a field of science, it&#x27;s easy to point to Lisa Nowak, who has been personally disgraced for her attempt at kidnapping Colleen Shipman, who pleaded guilty to charges of felony burglary of a car and misdemeanor battery, and who was discharged from the Navy in under other than honorable conditions. However, part of that was quite clearly illegal, so may not constitute the right kind of disgrace &quot;as a person&quot; that you are looking for.<p>But these are events that hit the big time news. What do you know about scientists who aren&#x27;t Nobel Prize winners, and who aren&#x27;t on world-wide TV?<p>That&#x27;s why a more rigorous search is needed. Retraction Watch and Science magazine both use the phrase &quot;disgraced&quot; in reference to scientists, and have a more complete coverage of what goes on in science. Do note that those science oriented sites don&#x27;t use &quot;disgraced&quot; to refer to the racism and sexism of Watson, et al., so the term &quot;disgraced&quot; is itself rather ill-defined.<p>For example, in <a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2013/10/special-report-can-nsf-put-right-spin-rotators-part-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2013/10/special-rep...</a> a co-worker says of Anja Strømme “She feels abused and disgraced, and it should have never happened”; do we accept that this is a case of being disgraced? If not, what constitutes a sufficient level of disgrace?<p>Or, if many male scientists thought it was disgraceful that a woman like Lise Meitner should work in physics, and snubbed her socially and in her career, is that really disgraceful? Or do you require that someone be successful and famous first, before being disgraced?<p>If your definition is so strict that only a few people over the decades meet the definition, the it&#x27;s hardly a useful definition, is it? Who else can you think of that have been disgraced? You make it sound like something that&#x27;s happened more than a dozen times, so it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to come up with more examples, no? Based on those numbers, how many women do you think should have been disgraced by this time?",1435358554

held the right to marry is protected by the Constitution. 
In 
Loving 
v. 
Virginia
, 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967), which invali
-
dated bans on interracial unions, a unanimous Court held 
marriage is “one of the vital personal rights essential to 
the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.”  The Court 
reaffirmed that holding in 
Zablocki
 v. 
Redhail
, 434 U. S. 
374, 384 (1978), which held the right to marry was bur
-
dened by a law prohibiting fathers who were behind on
child support from marrying.  The Court again applied 
this principle in 
Turner 
v. 
Safley
, 482 U. S. 78, 95 (1987), 
which held the right to marry was abridged by regulations 
limiting the privilege of prison inmates to marry.  Over 
time and in other contexts, th
e Court has reiterated that 
the right to marry is fundamental under the Due Process 
Clause.  See, 
e.g., M. L. B.
 v. 
S. L. J.
, 519 U. S. 102, 116 
(1996); 
Cleveland Bd. of Ed.

the right to personal choice 
regarding marriage is inherent
in the concept of individual autonomy.  This abiding con

Zablocki

supra,
 at 
384 (observing 
Loving 
held “the right to marry is of fun

damental importance for all individuals”).   Like choices 
concerning contraception, family relationships, procrea

Constitution, decisions concerning marriage are among 
the most intimate that an individual can make.  See

 v. 
Reed
, O. T. 
1971, No. 70–4, pp. 69–88 (an extensive reference to laws
extant as of 1971 treating women as unequal to men in
marriage).  These classifications denied the equal dignity
of men and women.   One State’s law, for example, pro- 
vided in 1971 that “the husband is the head of the family 
and the wife is subject to him; her legal civil existence is
merged in the husband, except so far as the law recognizes
her separately, either for he
r own protection, or for her 
benefit.”  Ga. Code Ann. §53–501 (1935).  Responding to a 
new awareness, the Court invoked equal protection prin
-
ciples to invalidate laws imposing sex-based inequality on 
marriage. See, 
e.g., Kirchberg
 v. 
Feenstra
, 450 U. S. 455 
(1981); 
Wengler

Frontiero

How can you make a claim about what the intention of the clause was (&quot;Actually, that is exactly what it was intended to mean&quot;) without claiming that Founder&#x27;s intent should be taken into account?<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s not pertinent to disclude the &quot;explanator preamble&quot; because, as you say, it&#x27;s explanatory. The clause and the Amendment itself comes before an Amedment that speaks of quartering troops in peace time. It&#x27;s clear that the writers intended the clause to be read in the context of militas.<p>&quot;Equally anachronistically, individual rightists read “the people” to mean atomized private persons, each hunting in his own private Idaho, rather than the citizenry acting collectively. But when the original Constitution spoke of “the people” rather than “persons,” the collective connotation was primary. In the Preamble, “the People” ordained and established the Constitution as public citizens meeting together in conventions and acting in concert, not as private individuals pursuing their respective hobbies.”
[..]
“Founding history confirms a republican reading of the Second Amendment, whose framers generally envisioned Minutemen bearing guns, not Daniel Boone gunning bears. When we turn to state constitutions, we consistently find arms-bearing and militia clauses intertwined with rules governing standing armies, troop-quartering, martial law, and civilian supremacy. A similar pattern may be seen in the famous English Bill of Rights of 1689, where language concerning the right to arms immediately followed language condemning unauthorized standing armies in peacetime. Individual-rights advocates cannot explain this clear pattern that has everything to do with the military and nothing to do with hunting. Yet states’ rightists also make a hash of these state constitutional provisions, many of which used language very similar to the Second Amendment to affirm rights against state governments.”<p>Amar, Akhail-Reed. &quot;America&#x27;s Consitution: A Biography.&quot; 736-737<p>I&#x27;m not making any claim about how the clause &quot;should&quot; be read, only pointing out that the current reading of it was decidedly not the intention of the writers themselves.

The overlong sentences are probably a symptom of too much coffee.<p>You’d have an “up” lane on the left and a “down” lane on the right, as in a paternoster or in Hitachi’s system mentioned in <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9786871"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9786871</a>, but the cars wouldn’t stop in them; instead, you’d have a “station” at each floor in between the two lanes for the car to stop in without blocking traffic.  (Popular floors, like typically the ground floor, would have several stations.)  The cars would be small and light, holding two friends or a parent with some small children comfortably, with seatbelts and a maximum gross weight of maybe 300 kg; you could have a door to keep you from accidentally falling out of the car while it was moving, but it wouldn’t need to be automatic, since if you didn’t manage to get it closed, it would inconvenience only you (and whoever else is waiting to reach your floor, if you’re on a single-station floor.)<p>Once you are in motion, you continue to your destination floor without stopping; because you are sharing the elevator shaft with other cars, you don’t need to share the elevator car with other people.  Your trajectory through spacetime to the destination station is reserved by the control computer before you leave the station, so that other cars will only crash into yours if there is a malfunction, such as a rail jam or a cable break.  Much of the time, cars will travel through the shaft in convoys with their bumpers in contact with one another, limited by the speed of the frontmost car, which will greatly limit potential collision damage if a malfunction should happen.<p>(Probably the optimal number of stations on most floors is two, not one, because with two stations, there will almost always be one unoccupied station that your arrival can be scheduled into.)<p>Power and non-emergency braking are applied to the cars using the same cable-traction system all current elevators use (except for those shitty Otis hydraulic elevators, and those few rack-and-pinion elevators), but the energy is not applied to or removed from the cable by a motor; it is delivered to your car entirely from counterweights connected to your car’s cable through a system of CVTs and clutches.  Low-power electric motors lift spare counterweights continuously to replace energy either lost to friction or stairway descents or currently stored in people or objects that haven’t returned back down to street level.<p>This system removes electric-power constraints to maximum acceleration, so that a continuous-jerk spline trajectory should allow comfortable ascents and descents with accelerations as large as ±⅓g. For a Burj-Khalifa-scale tower of 900 meters, ⅓g means you can comfortably travel from the bottom to the top, in any of the 100 or so cars, in about 20 or 30 seconds, reaching about 70 MPH in the middle of the trip, ten times normal elevator speed.<p>(Accelerating 300kg at ⅓g at 70MPH is about 43 horsepower, which is within the range of normal elevator power capacities, so it wouldn’t be impractical to build such a high-speed elevator system without the complicated CVT/clutch system, just inefficient.)<p>As with public-transit cable-car systems or cable tramways, your car can grasp and release cables dynamically, but it can grasp any of several different cables, allowing us to have more cars running at different velocities than we have cable loops and preventing cable breaks from being an emergency under normal circumstances.<p>And you would do all of this while taking up only the floor footprint of three small elevator cars on most levels, unlike the Burj Khalifa’s 57 large shafts, which run at one-third the peak speed described here and have to stop frequently because you share the car with a dozen other people.<p>(If you build a subway along these principles, you could use a 48-volt DC third rail; lightweight four-seat vehicles running on bicycle wheels powered by independent motors in the vehicle, rather than cableways; dirt-floored tunnels, unless you’re below the water table; and stations and lines spaced some 50 meters apart instead of 500.)",1435357330

El Paso, Texas has high naturally occuring lithium in the groundwater, and is widely reputed to have less violence than comparable cities with less lithium in their water.  I haven&#x27;t read the whole thing, but remarkably, a recent paper seems to have shown this to be true, at least for suicide mortality.<p>Lithium in the public water supply and suicide mortality in Texas (Blüml et al, 2013)<p><pre><code>  ￼￼￼There is increasing evidence from ecological studies that 
  lithium levels in drinking water are inversely associated 
  with suicide mortality. Previous studies of this 
  association were criticized for using inadequate 
  statistical methods and neglecting socioeconomic 
  confounders. This study evaluated the association between 
  lithium levels in the public water supply and county-based 
  suicide rates in Texas. A state-wide sample of 3123 lithium 
  measurements in the public water supply was examined 
  relative to suicide rates in 226 Texas counties. Linear and 
  Poisson regression models were adjusted for socioeconomic 
  factors in estimating the association. Lithium levels in 
  the public water supply were negatively associated with 
  suicide rates in most statistical analyses. The findings 
  provide confirmatory evidence that higher lithium levels in 
  the public drinking water are associated with lower suicide  
  rates.

I&#x27;ve bought 2D graphics on the web which I think are enough good to get say 200K players. I also have a friend I&#x27;ve worked with recently at a game company which has started to help on the design (units, skills). I&#x27;ve talk to numerous players on reddit, that help for the design too. Here is what it looks like (please note this is an old video, a lot have changed since, even the name of the game): <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNIFd6jxQbY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNIFd6jxQbY</a><p>edit: oh also, you should look at the following FAQ that may answer some questions.<p>FAQ:<p>Q: Why don&#x27;t you make a mobile game instead?<p>A: Ordinary game developers think there is some kind of a &quot;game industry&quot; which embodies the promess that if they make some cool content, copy some cool features and drop some names, they can make a profitable product.<p>Smarter people knows that a tiny fraction of softwares makes all the revenue. There is no exception to that rule, not even for games. Here is the proof: <a href=""https://thinkgaming.com/app-sales-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thinkgaming.com/app-sales-data/</a><p>If you look carefully, you&#x27;ll notice that the 10th grossing game on iOS make 10% of the revenue of the first one. The 100th does 1%. And so on.<p>But smarter people think that games are like cat pictures: you can&#x27;t predict which one gonna make it up to the top. Some top rated HN users think that, I have the names :)<p>I believe this is true about games on mobile platforms. Success on mobile is, well, just luck in my opinion. The proof is that it simply doesn&#x27;t exist a single company right now which has made multiple hits which gross at startup-level (unless it&#x27;s clones of the first product or others products, even then, the ratios are not the same). Another way of telling this is: I love flappy bird, it&#x27;s an amazing game really, I&#x27;ve played it a lot, but no one ever would have predicted it would be a success. Same for angry birds.<p>It is false on the PC platform however. The proof is that some companies succeed to make multiple, if not only, hits which gross at startup-level (ie. blizzard, valve etc.). It is important to add that their games have high skillcaps (more on that later) and they never die: players keep playing them. This is true games like chess and poker and these companies achieve to conceive many of them. That proves you can think rationally about games and make some predictions.<p>Q: Why don&#x27;t you make a facebook game then?<p>A: Beside poker, I&#x27;ve never seen a game on facebook, do you? I&#x27;m sure there is some but what I&#x27;ve seen the most are what we call in french <i>attractions</i>. That is roller coasters. So here is how it works. You put some cool banner on facebook. People click on it of course. Then, you put the people in wagons with a cool theme and you run the roller coaster in loop. At some point, you tell them it can go faster if they invite some friends. So do they. Since the friends of a random person on facebook is likely to click on a banner too, it works pretty well. Fine, I&#x27;ve no problem with this. But this is a very special kind of game if that is games at all. Real games have high skillcaps. It means that you can be better than your friend - subtancially better. Great games have even very high skillcaps, which means that you can dramatically beat your friend, also find someone who dramatically beats you and another one who dramatically beats the one who beats you and so on.<p>So here is the thing: Facebook offers a real nice feature which is the social graph. But it doesn&#x27;t mean a game has to use it to be an interesting project to invest on.<p>Q: All right, but what I want to say is, your game is too big to be done by a couple of guys isn&#x27;t?<p>A: I beleive this is false. The traditionnal way of shipping a game is to build all of it and then launch it to the world once and for all. I beleive it can be done another way. I beleive I can get 100 players playing it, then 1000, then 10000, etc, I just gonna make iterations. Minecraft did it that way.
My game is in 2D for example. It&#x27;s not top notch for a RTS, but I can get many players with a great 2D RTS. Once I have a great 2D game, I can replace the 2D graphics by 3D ones - it&#x27;s particularly easy for a RTS technically. If the game is great, it will generate enough revenue to make subtancial iterations/opus, the same way a startup grow.<p>Q: Have you launched a kickstarter campaign?<p>A: No. I&#x27;m not entirely sure I like kickstarter for early-stage games. It tends to actually bring back the old shipping method: a launch once and for all. I might be wrong. What I was thinking however, and I&#x27;m not sure it has be done already, is to launch a kickstarter campaign when the game is quite in a pretty advanced stage. I think that would maximize the success of the campaign. Just thoughts to be polished.<p>Q: Have you launched your game on steam greenlight?<p>A: Not yet. Unlike kickstarter for early-stage games, I beleive steam greenlight is an amazing tool. I&#x27;m looking forward launching on it very early.<p>Q: Wait, but have you already made games?<p>A: Yes professionnally and as a hobby. Most companies in that field totally sux however, imho, so I&#x27;ve never shipped a game you could tell your friends.

The government just has to show that the discrimination serves some permitted purpose, and depending on the groups involved may have to clear a high bar of proof that the alleged purpose is the real purpose (since some groups have historically been discriminated against for bad reasons, we have higher suspicion of new discrimination against those groups).<p>For example, state governments can require a person to have a driver&#x27;s license before driving a car. This discriminates against people who don&#x27;t have a license, but the support for it is rooted in a good reason: safety. Requiring people to pass a brief examination to show their knowledge of traffic laws and possession of the basic skills of driving is quite reasonable, and so driver&#x27;s licenses are a permitted form of discrimination.<p>Similarly, people under a certain age typically cannot enter into contracts on their own. The support for this comes from the fact that younger people are less likely to be mature and knowledgeable and understand what they&#x27;re getting into, so restricting it to a particular age (typically, the age at which one graduates from the public school system) and requiring the advice and consent of someone over that age for a minor to enter a contract is reasonable, and is permitted.<p>Over the past few years we&#x27;ve seen multiple alleged justifications for banning same-sex marriage asserted in courts, and each time they&#x27;ve been knocked down as nonsensical or even as contradicting the other policies of the state which advanced those arguments.<p>For example, we&#x27;ve seen an argument advanced that states have an interest in ensuring the production and safe rearing of future generations, that marriage is provided for the sole purpose of advancing that interest, and so a same-sex couple (who cannot procreate) should be excluded from marriage. Except this argument falls apart if you so much as breathe lightly on it: states which make this argument do not require any sort of commitment to have children from a heterosexual couple, and in fact will grant marriage licenses to couples known to be sterile, and many of them allow same-sex couples to adopt and raise children.<p>The result of this process has been that there really is no alleged justification or purpose left, other than &quot;we don&#x27;t like same-sex couples, largely for religious reasons&quot;. And that&#x27;s not something our country allows as a justification for a law (&quot;we don&#x27;t like that kind of people&quot; stopped being allowed about a half-century ago).",1435356409

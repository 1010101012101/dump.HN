4339926,comment,4337335,4337335,2,0,teyc,,,"I read the nanex article. Regardless whether it is true or not, the general trend is towards development of more sophisticated load testing programs.<p>The most benign ones were developed for use in IT systems. E.g. Apache bench. While these can cause disruptions if aimed at production services, this does not necessarily threaten the health of an entire enterprise.<p>However, the trend is that all software sectors are starting to adopt this particular technique of testing software with not sufficient regard to what happens if it is released into live systems.<p>For example, we have chaos monkey, from Netflix, which randomly shutdown services in a cloud based system.<p>What would happen if software which simulated meltdown at a nuclear facility was accidentally bundled into the build system by a tired operator? Or some one does the same with flight software?<p>The main software running trading platforms would presumably be supervised by another program to ensure that bad algorithms do not lose e company too much money. However there was no such tool for the component that generated the test data.<p>To me, it sounds like the supervision should be done at a higher level, e.g. A wrapper around existing APIs. All software running against live systems must call into the wrapper.<p>Secondly, test software should conduct some kind of verification. E.g. Check for evidence that it is testing against a Test system. This might be the presence of a nonexistent company, et c.<p>I am more than happy to compile any other ideas you may have so that the IT industry is able to build more fail safes into software.<p>We are starting to see some of these fail safes in practice. E.g. When you try to send out an email to everyone in the organization, email software may warn you if you are sure you want to do that. The problem is we haven't thought enough about these scenarios that we don't adequately address them.<p>Incidentally, over in Australia, the Commonwealth Bank suffered a major downtime when it's outsourcer HP accidentally pushed out system wide updates instead of doing this to select machines as originally intended.",1344120277

However you carve it, it will be quite expensive, once you throw in trained scouts, administration for scouts and moved families, foreign bureaucracy, domestic bureaucracy...<p>I'm not denying that there will be expenses. Obviously, some detailed calculations would have to be done and a cost-benefit analysis performed. However, my intuition tells me that it will be worth it when China starts to dominate. Moreover, the cost of living is low in India, so it would be a lot cheaper than training athletes in the US.<p>> So? The spirit of the games is supposed to be participation, not grinding other people's face in how awesome you are.

It would be remiss of us not to do everything legal and ethical in our power to fight back.<p>> All you do by purchasing athletes from other countries is dirty your own hands and making people think the same of you.<p>Once again, we wouldn't be ""purchasing"" them. They wouldn't be slaves or indentured servants. I don't understand how this would be a bad thing. These children would be given a chance at a vastly better life. It's not like they would be deprived of something because of our actions.<p>> Worse, even - 'the US had to import its talent to stay ahead of China's native talent'.<p>Except that is what the US is all about - we are a nation of immigrants.

4339916,comment,4337335,4339426,2,0,ewood,,,"In derivative markets such as futures there are predefined price and volume limits (in the jargon 'limit up' and 'limit down' - ie: max up and down movements.) These limits exist primarily to prevent market manipulation or cornering a market (buying the entire supply of a commodity) but have also been triggered by trading around events such as the Japan earthquake. Doing a quick search it seems that there are plans to trial these controls on equity markets (<a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2012/06/13/limit-up-limit-down-plan-and-circuit-breakers-approved"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2012/06/13/limit-up-lim...</a>)<p>The problem here though was that while some stocks had dramatic price movements that might have triggered a limit control, more heavily traded stocks were able to absorb the additional volume and the price did not move significantly. Knight were not doing anything outside of normal bands, they were buying normal volumes of stocks close to the current market price and selling close to the current price. What they were doing was illogical in a profit sense because they were buying at a high price and selling at a lower price and thus immediately losing money. I think it would be very difficult for an exchange to trap this kind of problem.<p>In all the issue of determining 'normal' trading is very difficult as markets tend to be much noisier than you might expect. The majority of trading occurs near the open and closes of major markets (Hong Kong, London, New York) or data releases (eg US Unemployment) so large spikes in volume and price are a regular occurrence. In equities this is even more difficult as smaller stocks will tend to be more volatile and profit reporting season increases this volatility even further. Markets are ruled by fear and greed, and falsely triggering a limit may cause larger issues than it solves.",1344120006

1.) Big data's promise has led to massive advances in technology, and companies are spending billions on this new technology  
2.) The limiting factor with Big Data is analytical in nature, not necessarily in storage, processor speed, etc.<p>What this article fails to address is why big data is so valuable. While it gave one example of a real use case (identifying influencers in social networks), if anything this served to highlight the problem with Big Data.  Are companies completely shifting their marketing budgets to target influencers?  Is this driving major financial impact for Facebook?<p>I have no doubt that companies are actively identifying incredibly powerful new uses of big data, but for big data to be truly revolutionary, we need to develop the analytic methodologies and decision-making processes to benefit.

I don't have to decide before I open the file if I want to duplicate it or not, and it would be very unexpected behavior for ':w newfile' to also modify the original file.",1344117834

Sure, this has often bad consequences, but daring to break the status quo should be generally rewarded, and only regulated in cases where the negative impact on society gets too extreme/long term.",1344117725

If most cells are dead, this happens very quickly. If you have to sweep over too many live cells (left deliberately vague), you grow the heap.",1344117719

When you say ""Echo users carry 1 card"" in comparison to the first two examples, you are implying a parity for which I can compare the three: I am likely the average American with 6 cards or even possibly in the 13% that have 10+ credit cards.  For both of those groups the card would need to be used in conjunction with a phone in order to get the same benefits as 6 or 10+ cards, but that is not illustrated in anyway.  This is misleading.",1344117624

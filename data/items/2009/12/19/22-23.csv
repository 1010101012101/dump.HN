Like comparable to the first Final Fantasy movie perhaps but not much better.  The first time I saw the trailer (at least two months ago, maybe an early cut?) I actually commented on how bad the CGI was before realising it was Avatar.  Added to this story just sounds like an old retold story as Arrington highlights.  I'm sure the film is actually really clever and the little I know of Cameron has led me to think he is a passionate and down-to-Earth guy so I'm sure it's good but I'm really not getting that impression so far.  In fact, this has to be the most marketed film ever (I see adverts everywhere even online and in the App-Store as well as tie-ins with multiple TV shows (Entourage, South Park come to mind)) and this kind of marketing always makes me instinctively wonder why it's so heavily marketed.

The infrastructure is the physical satellite/cell tower/everything supporting the mobile experience. The mobile experience encompasses the use of the network: phone numbers, SMS, digital downloads, WAP, etc.<p>However, the aspiration for Google (and my startup Avecora) is that the mobile telcos transform themselves into a strictly infrastructure play, essentially becoming the backbone NOT OF wireless telephony/texting/etc., BUT RATHER OF wireless intercommunication. Indeed, we want them to become completely hands-off in terms of the wireless experience, because they're good at infrastructure and making communication successful, but they're less good at innovating in the experience.<p>One of the reasons we don't want them controlling the wireless experience is that they have to support so much legacy <i>stuff</i>. My startup's big selling point is in the Avecora Network: there are no real ""phone numbers,"" but rather it operates on a more convenient structure: the mobile network is a social network. You call a person, not a phone number.<p>We both do want the internet to eat the phone system, and I think it'll offer a much more enriching and integrated mobile experience than it is today, especially when so much already works over TCP/IP (VoIP, for example.) However, with phone companies already making an absolute killing in costs (my bill this month is $90) I don't see this happening anytime too soon, especially the idea of VoIP replacing voice. The carriers will take a huge loss and there's no way in hell they'll sign off on that. (I'm skeptical of T-Mobile's $30/mo data-only plan—I can just grab that and hook up my $0.021/min Skype account to it.)<p>The best idea, and how we're approaching it, is to price it as one Connection Package and have it be on par if not a bit less than current prices. That's the only way it will really work for both the consumer and the telcos.<p>Google will get there first, perhaps with the killer product, perhaps not. Indeed, we are competing with Google, and we don't have a prototype right now—but in this space, it seems like, at first, it's more about the strategy than what we've got. (Wish me luck.)",1261261825

It was a cross-tabulation and organizational challenge so monumental, it called for a computer. Of course, in the 1930s no computer existed. But IBM's Hollerith punch card technology did exist.

Rather than bitching about Google Code, the JSMin author would be better served to get rid of the arbitrary, subjective and probably unenforceable clause from the license. The original JSMin is only 200 lines of C, so the simple solution would just be a from-scratch rewrite.",1261260438

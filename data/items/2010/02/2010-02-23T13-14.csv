I know because i had a differential equations exam friday that I hadn't opened the book on until ~5 hours before the exam.<p>math <i>should</i> be taught as a natural web of ideas that are intimately connected because that's what it is even more so than any other subject.  forget a formula?  if you understand the topic you can re-derive it trivially.  I've taken this philosophy to such an extreme that I often forget basic facts about manipulation because i know i can just figure it out with a quick proof if need be.  but hardly anyone is taught this way.  since we never learn to think critically about the methods we're learning from a young age we certainly can't suddenly start in college.<p>this is the main reason I believe there's such a heavy washout rate in higher math.  all of a sudden you have to think critically about <i>what you're actually doing</i> with those symbols on the page and its just an extreme shock because it's literally the first time for many people.  this is echoed in A Mathematician's Lament (great read BTW) where the author says that (para) kids who thought they were good at math suddenly discover they were only good at following directions.",1266932943

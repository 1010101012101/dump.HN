Other languages have to choose between tracking every variable (slow) and letting the programmer declare which values are going to be rewound if the transaction aborts (unsafe).<p>2: Your section on IDEs does not consider Leksah.

A generic &quot;this product contains chemicals known by the state of california to cause [birth defects / cancer]&quot; is sufficient.<p>Your last paragraph is wrong.<p>In this post <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10067135"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10067135</a> you said &quot;What is the meaning of the sticker, &quot;contains chemicals that cause cancer&quot;, if not, &quot;this product is dangerous&quot;?&quot; -- a prop 65 label does not mean a product is dangerous! In California dangerous food would be regulated by the California deparment for public health or the food and drug administration.  Your suggestion - that people could sell a food product with a dangerous amount of lead in it so long as they stick a label on it - is odd.  The safe harbor limits are provided so that the labels don&#x27;t go on everything.

In other words, a person exposed to the chemical at the “no significant risk level” for 70 years would not have more than a “one in 100,000” chance of developing cancer as a result of that exposure.<p>> For chemicals that are listed as causing birth defects or reproductive harm, the “no observable effect level” is determined by identifying the level of exposure that has been shown to not pose any harm to humans or laboratory animals. Proposition 65 then requires this “no observable effect level” to be divided by 1,000 in order to provide an ample margin of safety. Businesses subject to Proposition 65 are required to provide a warning if they cause exposures to chemicals listed as causing birth defects or reproductive harm that exceed 1/1000th of the “no observable effect level.”<p>Perhaps you think I am pro-Soylent?

I do not care much for MIDI piano; and since this music is typically monophonic, why not just use all the typical instruments? I generate the bodhran part from the MIDI and randomly choose to play a note, which kind of note to play, and whether to double up a note. I also give to each player the option to be late or early. Sometimes it gets a bit much, but is fun nonetheless.<p>bane: One of the reasons why I got into this music generation work is that it provides a sanity check of the internal models, just like speech recognition: look at the transcription to confirm the model is paying attention to relevant aspects. You may be interested in my &quot;horse&quot; article: &quot;A Simple Method to Determine if a Music Information Retrieval System is a “Horse”&quot; (<a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6847693"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6...</a>). Another reason is that I like to compose, I like traditional music, and here we go!<p>Yenrabbit: Thank you! I agree completely. It is quite hopeful to believe a single artificial system will produce &quot;music.&quot; It is merely shifting characters around according to a probabilistic model in light of constraints it has learned (such as four whole notes to a measure in common time), and it is up to musicians to &quot;realise&quot; it. Certainly, a lot is missing from the reduction to ABC. Music is much more than a sequence of arbitrary symbols. :)<p>All: you can browse all the tunes so far generated here: <a href=""http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~sturm/research/RNNIrishTrad/Session/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~sturm/research/RNNIrishTrad/Sess...</a><p>Many thanks for your comments!",1439800959

If US citizen want to ban old bows from being used in performances on their territory it is their choice to do so, and I broadly agree, based on what limited information I have read, that only a blanket ban can be effective.<p>What worries me is the tendency of law enforcement in this case to deviate from the rule of law. If someone has a permit and this permit is somehow invalidated upon their arrival, despite their having been told that everything was in order at departure (as was also the case in a previous thread about visas), individual rights have been infringed. It is not because it is something where many people have strong feelings (ivory and the slaughtering of African elephants) and the group of individuals affected is both small (classical musicians) and non-citizen, that the bending of the rules should be excused. Do you disagree with that position?<p>(I won&#x27;t argue about demand. I personally am more likely to see a performance if the performer uses a rare instrument, such as a Stradivarius or an Amati.

My apologies for lifting just four words out of your longer sentence, but the point is, I believe, critical:<p>> <i>&quot;network security&quot; sells products</i><p>Because people desire fire-and-forget solutions. We in the field know that security is not a product, or even (pun intended) a product of products. It&#x27;s an ongoing process, where a term like &quot;arms race&quot; fails to convey the full meaning or scope.<p>And above all, it&#x27;s hard. If you want network and communications security at scale, you will need to solve how to deploy a fairly large set of keys. Secure key distribution depends on auditable trust. Bootstrapping trust relationships is HARD.<p>Let&#x27;s take an easy example. The entire CA industry is built around the premise of seeking rent on trust. And then, to work around the problems that arose from having a CA system in place, we came up with solutions like certificate pinning. Which really boils down to imposing <i>distrust</i> upon the very system that exists because they sell trust.<p>While people want secure solutions, they really want to buy a product. Precisely they want something that &quot;just works&quot;, and in effect make the complexities of security someone else&#x27;s problem.",1439800390

Every so often, the customer (or rather, the alliance of customers) would send someone. He would pick a handful of requirements, and would then ask to see the complete chain from there; the breakdown of requirements from their level to the more functional level, the design that purported to meet those requirements, the code that implemented that design, the tests of that code, and then the tests of the original top-level requirements. We would literally get the relevant envelopes from QA, open them up and give him the paperwork. Everything signed, stamped, cover-sheeted and ready.

I lost  17 kg on the paleo diet( net loss, as I have gained a fair amount of muscle following gymnastic bodies WODs), but it's sometimes difficult to follow when you are traveling a lot, as I do. You don't realize how the vast majority of food you find on bars, cafeteria and restaurants is based on wheat or sugar till you try to avoid them!<p>Since january i am following a semipaleo Lean gains diet( semi paleo in the sense that I mostly avoid grains and sugar, but drink some milk or have some pasta or a cookie every now and then). I had regained some 4 kgs before chrismas due to really poor diet( only 3 months that I didn't take care of the diet and ...bam!). Now I've managed to lose 2 kgs and improved strenght(only cardio is 15 min once or twice a week as active recovery).
Definetely experiencing a nice body recomposition...

3554627,comment,3551684,3552424,19,0,zedshaw,,,"You can prove it had an effect on the employees that worked there, and to a fairly exact number.  The agreement covered <i>all</i> employees, not just tech workers.  Combined that makes up about 350k employees, and you can then extrapolate how many were engineers in silicon valley, or engineers in general.  That means that there was at least a proportion of the population that was affected very inversely by these agreements.  If you then realize that other companies use the larger more successful companies' salary policies as the model for their own, then it would have impacted other companies as well, and the employees that work there.<p>That alone disproves your implied statement:  That these agreements did nothing to anyone.  It definitely did something, and just the fact that those companies amount to tons of employees and tons of salaries is enough to show it had an effect.<p>You however are pulling the oldest trick in the book.  You want conclusive proof that these completely illegal actions by corporations had a measurable effect before you'll admit that they were wrong.  But, it was a <i>conspiracy</i>. You're not going to get exact numbers.  It's not like these guys are keeping a ledger of money saved by not-poaching.  You are basically demanding the impossible.<p>But, you are also demanding more than you give yourself.  Where's your proof this did nothing?  I know, you didn't explicitly say it did nothing, but that's your clever trick.  You just imply your counter argument and then run around dumping links to logical fallacies on Wikipedia rather than give real numbers.<p>So, Paul, stop being a hypocrite and give us your bet on what impact this really had.  If you demand exact socio-economic evaluations before you'll believe this did anything, then I demand that you give the same evidence it did nothing.<p>And your first task will be to disprove what's already been proven in court:  That these agreements did impact all the employees at these companies, that it did reduce salaries or they wouldn't have bothered, that reducing salaries was their goal, and that they did fire employees over it.<p>Until then, your demand for exact evidence violates the standard in philosophical argument that your own argument can't be used against itself.",1328464583

3554623,comment,3554054,3554520,8,0,CJefferson,,,"I agree with one side of your message.<p>There are very few people who have just learnt functional programming. I have met a few in academia, and they tend to be as ""bad"" as the pure Java/C++ programmers, but in a different way. They have trouble understanding how their code will boil down to CPU instructions, and so have trouble with performance, particularly (unsuprisingly) mutating algorithms, which are vital for performance in some situations.<p>After I have defined a high-performance algorithm, they often want to modify it to make it ""more beautiful"" (which means functional) and in the process destroy the performance.<p>Also, I had quite a lot of exposure to Haskell, and I haven't found C++ hate. I got some Haskell hate, because doing some things (mutating algorithms and bit fiddling) were really, really hard, while I found most of the things I loved from Haskell I could do in C++, with care.<p>I work on low-level algorithm design in A.I., where performance is everything and there are many interlocking, low-level and complex algorithms and data structures. I know that other problems might well have very different characteristics. For example, I have no real ideal how Haskell vs C++ would compare for the average web app for example (or of course, something like Ruby/Python which seem to be much more popular).",1328464504

3554618,comment,3554483,3554483,1,0,steve8918,,,"There really is no secret to losing weight.  It's very simple: eat less, exercise more.<p>The food being served in developed countries are highly processed, and make us very prone to gaining weight.  Highly processed carbs turn into blood sugar very easily, and if you live a sedentary lifestyle, like most of us, then that blood sugar gets turned into body fat.  It's very basic biochemistry.  The reason why we are eating highly-processed carbs is because food manufacturers get a high profit margin from feeding us from pre-processed food rather than original ingredients.<p>If you want to lose weight, the key is to either burn the blood sugar by exercising, or by denying your body the blood sugar in the first place, through a low-highly-processed carb diet.<p>But what that entails is rejecting the current 21st century lifestyle of eating quick, convenient meals, and working so much that you spend your entire life in front of a computer.  You really need to change your lifestyle in order to lose weight and have a healthier body.<p>I spent several years working and doing nothing after college and gaining massive weight (over 50 lbs).  About 8 years ago, I decided to lose weight, and just by exercising and eating marginally less, I went down down about 20 lbs.  But the vast amount of my weight loss came when I did the South Beach diet, and lost another 30 lbs.   That's when I realized how terrible highly processed carbs are.<p>I kept that weight off for about 3 years, until I started focusing on side projects and working about 16 hrs a day in total.  I stopped exercising completely for the last 3 years and since then, I've gained back about 20 lbs.<p>My goal this year is to lose those 20 lbs (actually in the next 4 months, fingers crossed), and to work less.  I've already started cooking the majority of our meals, and having complete control of the ingredients helps a lot.",1328464424

Realistically, a pound of fat loss in a week is extremely good, and amounts to a 3500 Calorie deficit.

I see it as more of a challenge than a reason to despair. For one thing, you can combine online education with offline practice (provided willingness of all parties involved to experiment with new approaches, which is certainly not a trivial thing to ask). Also, an approach I'd try is having games that simulate the real-world task as close as possible. At some point, you probably would need specialized equipment and/or test subjects.

I'm planning on transferring to a CCC for Fall 2012 to finish my basic studies and then transfer to a UC school. My reason for wanting to finish my basic studies at a CCC is that, while at the CCC, I will meet the requirements to reclassify as an in-state student for tuition purposes, drastically lowering the cost of attending any of the UC schools.<p>The biggest problem I face is money. One of the requirements for reclassifying as a California resident is that I have to prove financial independence. This means that I pretty much have to make it on my own for the next two years.<p>California isn't a cheap place to live, especially when I could end up working at Burger King making minimum wage. I was hoping there would be someone here who could give me some insight into whether it is possible and what it would require for me to support myself. I should qualify for a Pell Grant which will pay most of my tuition and I can use a series of scholarships/loans to pay the rest of my fees. I am already $30,000 in debt and I'm still looking at another 4 years of school because a lot of my credits won't transfer, so I don't want any more loans if I can avoid them.<p>Where would be the cheapest place to live? I'd like to be within an hour's drive of downtown San Francisco so I can throw myself into the startup scene and, maybe, find a good job.<p>How many hours a week would I need to work to support myself, assuming I was making minimum wage or slightly above? I'm willing to work full time if that's what it takes, but I'll be in school full time as well.<p>Any related advice/comments are definitely appreciated. If moving out West on my own is a silly idea, please, do tell me. I'm just a kid, what do I know? :)",1328463385

3554520,comment,3554054,3554054,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"My somewhat biased stance: functional programming languages make you progress as a programmer quickly. Becoming great requires <i>deliberate practice</i> and intrinsically hard problems. So you learn programming and CS about 5-10 times as fast in a functional language. This is part of why enterprise Java/C++ devs plateau at a skill level of 1.2 (even into their gray-haired years) while ML and Haskell programmers can reach 1.5 in a few years and generally cross 2.0 if they make a career out of software. (For reference, here's where I explain that scale: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a> ; it's a 0.0-to-3.0 scale and 1.5 is what most of us would consider a seriously good programmer.)<p>So if you want to grow as an engineer and computer scientist, learn these languages. You'll learn a lot fast, and not just about one programming paradigm (FP) but about complexity and how to manage it. You'll just learn a lot more about software because the way to learn software is to write it and one person can actually accomplish significant things in these languages. Java and C++ demote the individual contributor: ""commodity"" developers crank out classes and a more senior ""architect"" figures out how to bolt them together.<p>That said, these languages won't improve your performance in typical Java and C++ jobs. Six months of practice for exposure might give you some new ideas and make your code and performance better. Beyond that, they might diminish it. Why? Because you start hating these languages (Java and C++) and the accidental complexity they throw at you, which starts to look foreign and unnecessary. You get to a point where your own code (if you use the idioms of these languages, and you probably should, because it's not just about you) starts to look like someone else's. When you start hating your own code, disengagement sets in and it gets ugly fast. I can ""hack"" Java and C++ but I certainly wouldn't do a major project in them at this point.<p>My Java and C++ are uninspired now that I know better languages. Often, the only way I can write decent Java is to write it first in Scala (which I like, a lot) and transliterate the solution. Whether this produces ""good"" Java I don't even know.<p>Also, I really believe that C++ is the 21st-century COBOL. Java was gunning for that distinction, but Scala and Clojure gave it an assembly-like status, as the lowest-level language on the JVM (which will remain important for at least 15 years because of Scala and Clojure).",1328462344

To learn that, you need access to training in real hospitals which are only given to students enrolled offline.<p>Same thing with biochemistry (needs access to labs and direct mentorship), law (access to courtrooms? or certification from proper boards). Many of these other disciplines are based on initial trust. It takes time for a biochemist or a lawyer until their work results in something.

You could choose to study deterministic pushdown automata, and then you will learn about computation that fits in that model. Or you could study Markov algorithms and learn about computation that fits in that model. Or you could even study something like Turing machines augmented with halting oracles. For computers that fit a particular model, you can discover things like what they can and can't compute, how quickly they can compute various things, what it takes to convert a computation system defined in that model into another model, etc., and this will all follow from properties of the model you've chosen to study.<p>The only thing common to all models is that they have some way of mapping ""input"" to ""output"" via some change in ""state.""

3554457,comment,3553983,3553983,4,0,Jach,,,"What a great essay. There are so many points and places to branch off of and explore. I'll limit myself to a question about the following quoted part, though. It does look like it was slightly explored in other discussions so maybe it's not that interesting, oh well.<p>""Like all digitally encoded information, it has unavoidably the uncomfortable property that the smallest possible perturbations i.e. changes of a single bit can have the most drastic consequences.""<p>Is this really a unique fact about digital vs. analog systems? I'm not inclined to think so. He gives the example of pressing slightly harder on a pencil to get a slightly thicker line. Another possibility is that by pressing slightly harder, you cross the threshold of the paper's strength and wind up with an ugly hole. In the digital world, if I change the low-order bit of a single number in a single calculation, the result will be only slightly inaccurate. We can still get to the moon on inaccurate digital calculations. If I change the high-order bit it will be more inaccurate, and if I continue using the results then errors propagate. Similarly if I keep trying to draw over the hole in the paper I'll just wind up with a bigger hole. To put it shortly, initial conditions matter. Another way to put it, some small changes may indeed have large effects, some small changes may indeed have small effects, but you need to know what changed and in what environment the system is in in order to have any idea what to predict. Another way: any analog/continuous thing can be discretized, so is the problem with the discrete property itself so that only continuous systems that have been discretized will exhibit the problem, or is it fundamental to everything?<p>It seems to me that humans by default think that small changes <i>can only</i> have small consequences, whether those changes are to an analog or digital system. Small->Big is surprising when it happens. I'm sure there are lots of just-so evolutionary psych stories you could come up with to suggest how our brains got this way too. Imagining in great detail the huge effects made possible by such a small action as Stalin counter-factually being run over as a kid takes a lot of brain power that could be spent gathering food, consider how it might feel to have to imagine grand series of causes, effects, counter-factuals, and so on for 8 hours a day. (Or get back to doing it if you're a programmer at work.)<p>So I think Dijkstra is really getting at the fact that for the first time ever humans (programmers) have to be face-to-face with these hugely complicated systems, and they have to come to terms with the fact that tiny changes can and will cause big effects. In this sense, the second radical novelty of computing is just a special case of the first: dealing with the dynamics of fine-grained discrete systems like that of a digital computer is a big intellectual challenge for us when we're used to reasoning over Fuzzy or just large intervals.<p>After the section I quoted, Dijkstra points out that even with error correction the picture isn't changed. But I think error correction does significantly alleviate the problem--human bodies are also incredibly complicated but they're also robust and they have many error-correction features like an immune system. Computer programs on the other hand are extremely fragile. Nevertheless a single stupidly tiny virus with a simple DNA signature that is introduced to a human can cause that human to later die! In one of the other discussions someone mentioned that a tiny DNA change results in a lack of an iris. For all of our body's resistances to mitigate changes, we still can't escape the seemingly fundamental problem that small changes can cause big effects.<p><i>Edit</i>: On the example Dijkstra gives later on with the board and the dominoes, I knew I had seen that problem before. I saw it first here where it has pictures: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/rb/possibility_and_couldness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/rb/possibility_and_couldness/</a>",1328461361

Somehow, the numbers will just happen to end up being integers or perfect squares or exact multiples or whatever, so that there is an easy way to solve this specific problem (not a general problem of this sort but this specific instance).<p>In this case, you examine the numbers and spot that they are both just ""one off from one"" fractions, so the sum is roughly 1+1. The test givers will then see to it that there is only one answer that matches the result of the ""trick"" they were testing to see if you could find.<p>Kids who get a lot of math internalize this heuristic, which actually trips them up briefly when they start having real science classes, because they think they've done something wrong if the answer turns out to be 5.6293 or 0.07291 instead of 4 or 9 or 5/8 or sqrt(10).

(It's a simple argument: the sub-circle has area proportional to R^2, so to get the number of points proportional to the area, the radius must go like the square root of the number of points.)<p>You choose a ratio `s` and define the angle as `angle(k) = 2 * pi * s * k`. Finally, the actual points are located at `x(k) = R(k) * cos(angle(k))` and `y(k) = R(k) * sin(angle(k))`, which you scatter-plot as points. Then you can play with this graph for different values of `s`. Indeed, the ""spirals"" which you count correspond to the denominators of the best rational approximations to those values; try using s = pi and you'll see 7 branches at first, then 113. It gets this magical appearance when you choose s = phi, where the points don't ""stack on top"" of each other, because the golden ratio is the most irrational number. You can also use the Python scripts in the document above to search for other ""highly irrational"" numbers (ones with low numbers in their continued fraction representations; the square root of 3 is pretty good for example).<p>If I turn the above document into a proper essay, I'd probably also create an HTML5 canvas which draws parametrized sunflowers, to save the effort of creating that whole darn spreadsheet.",1367699112

</code></pre>
If you have the pv utility installed, you can get progress bars:<p><pre><code>   dd if=/dev/sda bs=16777216 | pv -c -W | gzip -c9 | pv -c -W > /path/to/sda.img.gz
</code></pre>
To restore (WARNING:  THE FOLLOWING COMMAND IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, USE IT ONLY IF YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING):<p><pre><code>   pv -c -W /path/to/sda.img.gz | gzip -cd | pv -c -W | dd bs=16777216 of=/dev/sdx
</code></pre>
Of course, you can use your favorite compression program instead of gzip; on Debian-like systems, bzip2 or xz should be drop-in replacements available by default.<p>If you want a compressed image which you can mount read-only without uncompressing (e.g. if you want to be able to reach into the backup and pull out a single file or directory), you can pipe the dump to a FIFO and then use the pseudo-file feature of mksquashfs [1].  E.g. something like this (commands not tested, there may be typos):<p><pre><code>    mkfifo sda.fifo
    echo 'sda.img f 444 root root cat sda.fifo' > sda.pf
    dd if=/dev/sda bs=16777216 > sda.fifo &
    mkdir empty
    mksquashfs empty sda.squashfs -pf sda.pf
    mount -o ro,loop sda.squashfs /mnt
</code></pre>
You then have an uncompressed image visible.  If it's a whole-disk image (/dev/sda instead of /dev/sda1), you need to use a program called kpartx to make device nodes for each partition.<p>I recommend reading the man pages and playing around with these utilities in a Virtualbox VM with a small disk.<p>Of course, this approach doesn't pay any attention to filesystems.  Which means it works with Windows partitions (unlike LVM or btrfs snapshots).  But there are limitations; it reads and stores ""empty"" space not occupied by files (I recommend making a large file full of zeroes beforehand to make the empty space compress better), restoring to a smaller disk is difficult if not impossible, restoring to a larger disk requires you to resize manually afterwards if you want to use the extra space.<p>[1] It's a little easier conceptually to make a squashfs directly from an image file, but that approach requires you to store the image file, which requires temp space equal to the size of the disk you're backing up.   The pseudo-file approach has a benefit of not needing temporary space equal to the size of the disk being backed up, you just need enough space for the compressed result.",1367698986

Every proof or revocation you do on Keybase is put into a chain for you, and in turn that chain is attached to our merkle tree and written to the bitcoin block chain.

Without going into the technical details (because I&#x27;m not the person for that - I&#x27;ll leave that to rancher), RancherOS isn&#x27;t just a Docker image.  It runs Docker at the core.  Not just an OS with Docker in it.  This gives it the potential to have an update mechanism similar to CoreOS etc.<p>You are correct in that it is very similar to boot2docker.  boot2docker is also a very light distro with docker (and by &quot;very light&quot; I mean awesome slim -- steeve is amazing :)  The main difference, as I see it, is in updating / extending / packages.  With TCL, you need to either find the package and include it in your build or create the package with a build chain etc. which isn&#x27;t trivial.  In the RancherOS route, you could simply pull a new docker image.<p>The interesting thing to me is it offers choice.

Given the <i>accelerating</i> expansion of the universe, there&#x27;s an eventual &quot;horizon&quot; where light beyond that limit will never manage to get here, simply because the empty space between here and there will expand faster than the light can make up the distance. My understanding is that under current cosmological models, a likely scenario is that eventually (on the order of multiple billion years), everything beyond our local gravitationally-bound group of galaxies (us, Andromeda, and a few hangers-on) will be 100% invisible forever. Kinda makes you wonder what distant-future astronomers might think of the old tales of &quot;galaxy clusters&quot; or &quot;cosmic structure formation&quot;.",1424875453

SPKI/SDSI specifically <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the authority/tree-of-trust model: although it could be used as the infrastructure to build an authoritative, tree-of-trust system, it could also be used as the infrastructure to build a web-of-trust system, and it can be used as the infrastructure to build an even less trust-requiring system.<p>> In the end a tree-of-trust rests on the fact that you trust the manufacturer of your laptop that they put trustworthy certificates there so you could verify the roots.<p>For hostname and IP address ownership, there <i>is</i> a central authority: ICANN.  The problem with the CA model is that someone other than ICANN can lie about who owns a hostname.  As for the ICANN roots, those should be publicly known and verified in the same way that any information is publicly known and verified (ultimately, it comes down to verification).<p>The problem with ICANN being a central authority is that knowing that I&#x27;m talking to the legitimate owner of &#x27;apple.com&#x27; tells me <i>nothing</i>.  It could be Apple Records or an apple farm or a guy who just really likes Apples for all I know.  The CA system uses a ridiculously expensive, painful process to do ICANN&#x27;s job for it, and still doesn&#x27;t provide <i>me</i> the guarantees I need in order to do business online.<p>With respect to email, I can use a tree-of-trust system to guarantee that I can send email to the legitimate owner of an email account, but I cannot guarantee that said legitimate owner is the person I think it is (after all, ICANN in a very real sense owns the Internet, and could transfer anything to anyone).  If I wish to, I could use an SPKI/SDSI system to ensure that I&#x27;m sending a message to the person who the person who the person who I think is Jim thinks is Sally thinks is Bill.<p>Which, really, is the only way trust can work anyway.

Touch Events was born from Apple&#x27;s initial work to touch-enable Safari on the iPhone. W3C moved to standardize it but Apple declined to be involved in the effort.  Then they blocked the WC3 from releasing it as a standard using their patents, which they were unwilling to offer a royalty free grant for users of the spec.<p>Pointer Events was first proposed by Microsoft as an alternative solution.   It was also a more general specification; while Touch Events was designed for touch and touch alone, Pointer Events allowed developers to use similar code to handle touch, stylus/pen, and mouse inputs. Pointer Events also addressed certain problems with Touch Events, such as a 300 millisecond delay before responding to taps in order to disambiguate between single and double taps.<p>Then the patent issue was resolved — W3C determined that Apple&#x27;s patents didn&#x27;t cover Touch Events anyway so they could release a Touch Events spec.  All this time work on Pointer Events continued in parallel, backed not just by Microsoft, but also by Mozilla, jQuery, and Google.<p>Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer both implement Pointer Events. In 2012 Microsoft contributed code to WebKit, the rendering engine then used by both Chrome and Safari. While Apple never enabled the code, Google offered its support, and this continued even after Google forked WebKit to produce its Blink engine. It looked as if three of the four major browsers were on track to support the specification.<p>Then Google pulled support in August.  Their stated rationale was that because Apple was unlikely to ever support Pointer Events and Apple is the dominate force in the mobile web; Touch Events would always be required.  It&#x27;s a decision that hasn&#x27;t gone over well with web developers, just look at the comments on the Chromium bug tracker.",1424874802

Finally, a Message-Queue and a Timer-Service that makes heavy use of the Persistence-Container functionality build the last layer. These completely stateful services are bundled with functionalities like AOP, Dependency-Injection, Design-by-Contract, and Annotations.\nDevelopers do not need other programming skills as all functionality is completely written in PHP. This fact will dramatically lower the barriers and enables PHP developers using appserver.io instantly.\nYou can use appserver.io with your existing applications like Drupal, Magento or Wordpress and benefit from the performance and additional opportunities of appserver.io.\nThe most powerful Open Source PHP infrastructure comes with the following features together in one bundle: \nA fully HTTP/1.1 compliant webserver that can process requests over HTTP, as well as HTTPS.

But now that we&#x27;ve added HackerNews key proofs, I&#x27;ll let people in <i>today</i> who notice this post who have more than 1 karma and write &quot;I&#x27;m HN: {theirusername}&quot; in the request form.<p>2. We&#x27;re not just about PGP keys. It looks that way now, and our first goal was to help solve the very on-the-record type things developers do. Which mostly requires PGP - and PGP is very good at.  Signing code and commits, releasing software, etc.  But sometime soon each of your Keybase devices will have a device-specific Nacl key, for example. And the process for provisioning devices is something we&#x27;re taking very seriously - we&#x27;ll soon have a big blog post about how public sibling key announcements will work. Here&#x27;s the foreshadowing:  with a Keybase account, very soon you&#x27;ll be able to start with something as simple as a Twitter or HN username, and do some very cool, secure things with files and messages.<p>[EDIT] We are hiring. There&#x27;s no specific job page because we&#x27;ve mostly been reaching out to people quietly, but we want help building: the Keybase client (Go), iOS and OSX GUIS (Obj-C), and the site (front end development and back end (Node)).

Wordpress has the unique ability to use a single install and backend to manage hundreds of sites. If you need content cross posted across multiple sites, wordpress can do that. If you want to pull an entire column of articles from one site to another, wordpress can do that.<p>Wordpress has spent a ton of time on multisite features and (as far as I know) there&#x27;s no other CMS in existence that handles this stuff out of the box. That&#x27;s why large media companies love it and, I suspect, why a quarter of the internet runs it still when there are faster and more secure alternatives out there.",1447001773

10528936,comment,10528683,10528870,0,0,tete,,,"I actually switched to using Tor whenever I go on wild hunts about stuff that I find interesting. Basically that means whenever I visit Wikipedia, because I can waste hours there, going over the weirdest topics.<p>Usually I get drawn in by stuff like history and end up on things like Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, Japan in WW2, etc. or stuff like Ku Klux Klan, the &quot;Islamic State&quot;. If there is some surveillance system it will probably be thinking I am into each and every kind of extremism. And since extreme groups like the Nazis have the wildest conspiracy theories that also is something I don&#x27;t want to identified with.<p>Using Tor by using the Tor Browser is actually pretty nice and pretty fast, both to set up and when browsing. Years ago Tor used to be rather slow. That totally changed.<p>The are a few annoyances though.<p>Some websites seem to have weird rules such as &quot;block Tor completely&quot;. Come on, your website can still be exploited. You will not really stop anyone that way.<p>Then there is the problem of websites usually requiring JavaScript for everything. The latter is weird, cause it&#x27;s like people use &quot;front end frameworks&quot; for stuff where it doesn&#x27;t really make sense and even slows down the page a lot. I am not saying JavaScript is evil, but I think people overuse them these days. Of course you might decide to enable JavaScript and unless you set the Tor Browser to highest security at least HTTPS sites will deliver and execute JavaScript.<p>Another major annoyance is CloudFlare. They require you to enter a CAPTCHA (which for some time didn&#x27;t work), when accessing a website via Tor. The only way to disable it is for the website owner to completely disable security. I mean I get that they probably want to prevent some script kiddies from &quot;hacking&quot; unpatched Wordpress or so, but maybe this can be enhanced. Cause like I said above. The approach of filtering certain IPs isn&#x27;t really enhancing actual security and nobody is going to DDOS you via Tor. ;)",1447000894

10528931,comment,10526678,10528004,0,0,optionalparens,,,"No offense, but I would venture your food does not taste so good and a lot of what you are saying sounds like someone who is grossly inexperienced. Burning garlic and onions is the sign you are not a very good cook, for instance. That&#x27;s cooking 101 and should never happen. That&#x27;s like burning scrambled eggs - easy, but a sign someone is a very bad cook.<p>There&#x27;s a very good reason chefs generally do things in certain orders, and it&#x27;s not just consistency and cook time. You did not &quot;figure out&quot; what billions of people before you could not. A lot of the reasons why people do not cook things as you describes have to do with basic chemistry. Chemistry is what you are really neglecting given your 3 categories - things like caramelization, absorbing flavors, catalysts, reactions. Not all your choices are bad (cast iron is great), but many have consequences for flavor (coconut oil is tasty, but strong, and has a high smoke point) and others are just head scratching.<p>I don&#x27;t even know where to start with your cooking technique, but let&#x27;s discuss sautés. Firstly, you do not have to cook everything together, at the same time, same temperature, all mixed by the end. I know this sounds counter-intuitive, but some of the reasons around cook time and temperature are there precisely so things blend together well. Other reasons include removing things like water, salts, bitter tastes, etc. from food. For example, you can actually often cook your meat first to some level such as a simple browning. This will season the pan nicely, allow you to do things like sear your meat correctly, and provide some tasty fat to add flavor to your veggies while they cook. Later, you can add back the meat to finish it off and make sure it&#x27;s safely cooked to the proper temperature. Your way of cooking meat is not always wrong, but for many dishes it will often have consequences - soggy meat, veggies overdone, meat not safely cooked, lack of flavor from fat, no sear, textural issues, and so on.<p>Pretty much the same applies to stews. For one, many if not most stews taste infinitely better if you caramelize a lot of the veggies directly in your cooking pot, then pour your liquid base on. Never mind you seem to be making stews generally without any concept of stocks and using things like butter as thickening agents (shudder). Too much water is definitely not a good thing for stew and something that is not easy to fix. Thickening stews is somewhat of an art, but there are also many well-known ways that don&#x27;t involve what you describe.<p>I&#x27;ve already written a novel, but I highly suggest you buy one of those textbooks from a cooking school (CIA for example). You may look down on professional texts, but cooking is one area where learning the academics are very important. While there&#x27;s always room for tweaking and personal touches in cooking, completely ignoring cooking techniques will get you no where. I am sure your food makes you happy, but if you want to challenge yourself and grow, you should really do as I have suggested and buy some books. I do not mean to harshly criticize you, but rather you seem someone interested in cooking that could maybe enjoy it more but lacks some basic knowledge to be a better cook.",1447000806

A lot of the &quot;theory&quot; in imperative programming seems four steps removed from the underlying theory (to the point where you can&#x27;t really trace patterns to their underlying theoretical reasoning).<p>Sure, that often makes is easier to understand and utilize. To me, however, after 8 years of that, it&#x27;s pretty sobering to start realizing just how much of your repertoire is cargo culting.<p>I would also argue that there is a huge difference in how the two worlds use, or even understand, design patterns. FP often puts you through the trouble of going back to basics (yes, sometimes even mathematical basics) and that can take enormous amounts of and effort.

10528895,comment,10528252,10528575,0,0,PopeOfNope,,,"I worked briefly for a wordpress consultancy last year.<p>Our main workflow involved using Yeoman, Grunt, NPM, wp (the wordpress command line tool) and vagrant. Locally, we&#x27;d run vagrant just so we don&#x27;t have to monkey around with environment issues (too much). Yeoman, grunt, npm and wp were used in tandem to script the creation of a new wordpress install, install any dependencies needed, run any tools needed through grunt (like sass and JS minifiers), and pull plugins and themes from their separate git repositories. We still had to import the database by hand, though, when setting up our environment as well as add lines to wp-config for however we wanted to handle debugging.<p>Then we&#x27;d write code and check it in via git as with any other project. If you were working on frontend anything (html,css,js) you either ran grunt all the damned time or ran grunt watch. Those of us who had a hard time with the unique programming requirements of wordpress (escaping, sanitizing, formatting) used phpcs to automate that.<p>As for deployment, we&#x27;d just go through the same setup on the server that we do locally. Updates were pushed via git.<p><i>The fundamental problem my company runs into with WP is that only a theme can be meaningfully checked into version control. Everything else, including installation of plugins is coupled with entries in the database.</i><p>That wasn&#x27;t my experience. We separated functional features into separate plugins (so they could be disabled or enabled on a site by site basis) and had no problem using version control with them. In fact, one project had some government security problems and required each plugin to be in its own repo. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest that, but it works.<p><i>the database also includes changes necessarily made on the production instance, like comments to blog posts</i><p>That was something I found aggravating that was never really addressed at the company I worked at. When new people were brought on to a project, they&#x27;d get a mysql dump of the staging environment. After that, as new features were added, you were responsible for adding your own test data to see if those features worked. As for production, the changes made that were specific to the production database were made manually in production. When a new plugin was pushed, you had to log into the production instances manually and turn the new plugin on. Luckily, there are hooks you can use to automate any setup or teardown of plugins when they get turned on and off respectively.",1447000046

Many vegetables I had to figure what they were and what to do with them -- daikon radishes, chard, tomatillos, squashes, etc. Some I had never used, like fresh jalepenos. Without the flood, I was always planning, never doing. With the flood, I acted. That&#x27;s where we learn -- by doing.<p>My fallback with something I didn&#x27;t know was to steam, then put on olive oil, salt, and pepper or to saute with garlic and onions. I ended up eating everything and much of it was the best I&#x27;d ever tasted (eating the cherry tomatoes was nearly a religious experience).<p>In the process, I learned a lot about food and cooking. I don&#x27;t consider myself a good cook, but at a farmers market yesterday I recognized everything, knew what to look for, and came home with radishes, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, Jerusalem artichokes, and a few other things I never or rarely would get.<p>This year I&#x27;m just keeping up -- meaning a lot of steamed vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper, which is usually pretty tasty.

For the category of sets and functions between sets, that means you have to use the weaker idea of a &#x27;collection&#x27;.<p>A positive side-effect of this avoidance of set axioms in the definition of a category is that we can more easily define categories with very different ideas of membership. For example, a category where membership is a real number (like in fuzzy logic). Categories with this idea of &#x27;generalised membership&#x27; (plus a few extra bits and bobs) are called &#x27;toposes&#x27;, and can be used in much the same way as sets are. Importantly, we can relate different categories like this together using the same terminology and concepts and so more easily define ways to join classical code with fuzzy logic, or with neural networks (or anything else which satisfies the topos axioms) and know they&#x27;re not insane.<p>Incidentally, you can define the axioms of a topos (and sets are a topos) in purely category theory terms. That is why some (and I&#x27;m one of them) view categories as a more useful foundation than set theory (where attempts to define the converse are much more messy).",1446998636

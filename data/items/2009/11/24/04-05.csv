This makes it clear what the decisions was (and more importantly, how I interpret it) and provides documentation to both sides that the issue was discussed and a conclusion reached.""<p>""When I know I am wrapping up a coding session, I'll often leave a few trivial things unfinished - so that when I sit back down again for the next session, I'll have an easy place to jump right back in, and it will force me to (consciously or otherwise) get back to somewhere near the mental state I was in when I half-finished the thing.""<p>Are you really as important as you make out?",1259038667

Already, they can detect better than elderly or disabled humans.

From there, I would catch an international flight off to my honeymoon.  Of course, things are never that easy.<p>It started with United claiming weather issues at JFK.  Understandable, as getting delayed in to New York is a common occurrence.  But we noticed things weren't adding up when the scheduled departure time would come and go while we were still on the ground.  United delayed our flight -and no other- 30 minutes at a time for 6 hours straight.<p>I tried to find out what was going on.  I checked FAA reports, I called multiple airline booths in both airports, no one could explain why -only- our flight was delayed and why it had been delayed for so long.<p>With FlightCaster, I get the ability to calculate opportunity cost.  For my case, we missed our international connection, had to pay for a last-minute hotel in New York, and lost a day of our honeymoon.  The direct cost to us, in both economical and emotional terms, was WAY higher than the cost of switching to a different flight.<p>Knowing the winning horse after the race is useless intel.  But knowing which horse has a edge is powerful information before the fact.",1259038177

958722,comment,958613,958707,0,0,JimmyL,,,"It depends on who ""you"" are in this example. If you're someone who is flying for personal reasons or non-mission critical business reasons, then you're 100% right - knowing ahead you'll probably be late is interesting, but not enough to do anything about since you don't want to pay change/cancellation fees. I'm this guy when I travel for personal reasons.<p>But I also travel a lot for business, and when I do, travel is 100% critical. If I don't show up when I am scheduled to, there will often be several thousand people - not to mention three national news networks - waiting for me and my traveling party. Those people won't wait around, and will embarrass me and my people on a national stage.<p>Hence, for business travel, I use a travel management company for all my movements. I fly full-fare economy (so there are effectively no penalties to change my flights), and have a someone who gets paid a significant commission to monitor the status of my travel plans and adjust them on the fly based on weather and traffic conditions. Maybe 1.5 times per month I'll get a call/email from my travel guy some time between a day and a few hours before my departure telling me something has changed - either my routing or my departure time (incidentally, my travel guy is the only person outside my team who has access to our detailed daily calendar, so he can adjust for this).<p>I have no doubt that my travel manager would pay good money for this information, if it was statistically reliable. For people who travel for fun, I think you're right - a delay isn't a delay until the airline says it is. But for people who absolutely have to get where they're going - to the level that they'll charter a plane on an hours' notice if needed - this would be invaluable.",1259037468

His letter was written to the ACM in 1991. Baker was an established and respected computer scientist and iconoclast. To treat the letter as if it were written yesterday is foolish and disrespectful, In any case, had Baker's remarks been misguided or irrelevant then the ACM would not have published them.<p>Baker was always in demand. No need to compare resumes: you likely would not rank well against him,<p>""Flat files"" were used often for batch processing. For sequential processing and merging/splitting/sorting of data they are usually faster than RDBMS. During that processing, temporary files might be created that are indexed, hashed, or sequential.<p>Today network-style databases remain faster by at least an order of magnitude (and sometimes two)  than relational databases. Ask any knowledgeable mainframer  about the relative speeds of their network-style vs relational databases. The same holds for smaller computers too.<p>Baker would have no problem ""wrapping his head around"" almost any problem. An archive of some of his research papers:<p><a href=""http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/</a><p>You saw ""subsecond intercontinental response time on massive relational database installations as early as 1981"", when IIRC the only relational databases available was Oracle and possibly Ingres. My memories are that Oracle's early versions were performance dogs by any standard. But perhaps you can refresh our memories by citing performance statistics and showing us benchmarks.<p>PICK was not a relational database.<p>TOTAL was not a relational database.<p>Your remarks remind me of how so often when an excellent programmer leaves a shop, the remaining developers diss his work and argue for rewriting all of his (excellent working) code.<p>But to miss on almost every statement?

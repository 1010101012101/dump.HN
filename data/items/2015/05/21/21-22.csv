I&#x27;m guilty of what you state and I think a large part of &quot;programming&quot; is rudimentary boiler plate coding/configuration and staring into the Abyss. I think our role will be to design algorithms and come up with creative solutions/hacks (which would be difficult for a program) and designing a workflow/flow chart and feeding it into a program which spits out binaries and flag for edge cases. A whole swat industries and economies (read outsourcing) will become redundant and only outsourcing done would be to the generator.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaEzHI9xyY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaEzHI9xyY</a>",1432245545

Money doesn&#x27;t just grow on its own; capital accounts don&#x27;t accumulate by virtue of their own gravitational pull. The degree of risk doesn&#x27;t really change the fact that that capital is risked as investment hopefully helping other people succeed, rather than just sitting in a Scrooge McDuck swimming vault somewhere.

9585442,comment,9581186,9584939,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">But this is yet another argument over definition or a value judgement. I have spent most of my life studying math and science, and yet reading Dostoyevsky has given me much more abundant insight into my life than anything science ever taught me.<p>And you think there is no science of people?  You think that just because our current understanding of psychology is fairly hazy, it must remain that way forever?<p>Or worse: do you think that there is nothing psychological about what happens when you read Dostoyevsky, nothing that a science of human beings can say about your experience, even in principle?  How much are you willing to multiply &quot;irreducibility&quot;?  Until it covers your whole worldview like a cancer?<p>>As to non-naturalist ethics, I see absolutely no problem with concepts that are irreducible to atoms. Neither is math, even though math was created/discovered by humans, which live in this universe and are composed of atoms.<p>But of course math is reducible to atoms.  Or, if that seems a strong statement, math is not irreducible <i>by default</i>: Platonism is not the <i>only</i> viable philosophy of mathematics, such that taking any other position generates an immediate internal (within math) or external (with our other knowledge of the world) contradiction.  Both constructivism and formalism yield neat interpretations of math as certain kinds of computations being done within human minds.<p>>In short, I don&#x27;t think you can reduce, say, literature, to atoms and forces even though the author and the reader are composed of atoms, and the reading process involves photons hitting receptors that start a chemical reaction in the retina. Doing so will teach us nothing of value about literature.<p>See above regarding psychology.  Since atoms and forces make up the author and reader, we can use our theories about those to zero in on correct theories about the author and the reader, thus gaining an understanding of what the reader is experiencing and how he is playing an active part in reading a book.  Certainly science can teach us more about literature!<p>You seem to be confusing naturalism with what&#x27;s been called &quot;greedy reductionism&quot;, which is a metaphilosophical - and therefore damn near nonsensical - view, namely that only the most ontologically basic level of description <i>actually matters</i>.  In fact, if we <i>don&#x27;t</i> employ our more abstract, high-level concepts like &quot;human being&quot; and &quot;Dostoyevsky novel&quot; and &quot;armchair&quot;, we completely fail to make accurate predictions about the behavior of the very much natural world around us.<p>As long as these higher-level, and yet closer-to-experience, concepts possess causal power - as long as they make our predictions better and our counterfactual models more accurate upon interventional testing - we <i>must</i> use them.  Your thoughts and feelings are <i>utterly essential</i> components of a naturalistic explanation of the world.<p>They are <i>also</i>, ultimately, made of particles, joules, and bits.<p>Likewise to such mental activities as math and morality.<p>>A shovel is more useful than a pen for digging holes, but who says digging holes is more worthwhile than writing? Even if you think it is, you cannot prove it scientifically, because science can say nothing about values, only point at relationships between causes and outcomes.<p>This displays the funny post-religious misconception that values are relative to &quot;the Universe&quot; rather than to agents.  This is incorrect.<p>And, presto change-o, when speaking of a specific agent, I can <i>certainly</i> say whether digging a hole is more worthwhile than writing, or the other way around.  Again: a scientist who <i>fails to predict</i> that I (to take the personal example) would rather read and write than dig a hole is simply <i>inaccurate</i>.<p>>That doesn&#x27;t follow. First, I don&#x27;t know how science can teach us that something is &quot;wrong&quot;. I don&#x27;t know by what scientific or mathematical mechanism you can ever make the jump from the &quot;is&quot; to the &quot;ought&quot; -- at the very best science can teach us that if we seek a certain outcome, we should take a certain action, but can it tell us what outcome we should seek?<p>Which shows a nasty hole in your philosophical education, but regrettably an all-too-common one: you were never told ethical naturalism (<a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-moral/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-moral/</a>) exists.<p>>But it&#x27;s even worse than that because there is another philosophical, unscientific mediating factor here, which is &quot;understanding&quot;. Being able to describe the universe and understanding it are two very different things. We can know without understanding.<p>You seem to be just pushing words around, but may I venture to guess that you mean to differentiate between discriminative &quot;describing&quot; and causal-counterfactual &quot;understanding&quot;?<p>>In fact, I can even give the last statement a more mathematical facet: that a process B reduces to a more fundamental process A, does not guarantee that fully knowing A will let us predict B because of intractability.<p>Certainly.  In fact, this is the nature of reduction: to reduce B < A implies that B happens as a specific instance of A, which often means that B occupies a tiny corner of A&#x27;s parameter space, and almost <i>always</i> means that B&#x27;s parameter space is much smaller than that of A.  For example, in describing gasses, we can describe the precise velocities of every single molecule (the more-reduced theory), or we can measure the temperature of the gas as a whole (the less-reduced, higher-level theory).  The intractability is often both computational and informational.<p>This merely reinforces what I said above, which is that we <i>need</i> the higher-level concepts to correctly understand, interpret, and predict the world.  Concepts like &quot;human being&quot;, &quot;sunset&quot;, &quot;profundity&quot;, &quot;confusion&quot;, and (just for the hell of it) &quot;love&quot; are also <i>utterly inescapable</i> components of a naturalistic worldview.<p>It&#x27;s just &quot;irreducibility&quot;, or in other words, metaphysical handwaving and magical thinking, that aren&#x27;t.",1432243074

Some things that bothered me ...<p>Akka follows the Erlang actor model pretty faithfully and what you do in the actor model is that you model <i>state machines</i>. In Scala you can also work with scala-async [1], which is basically what Quasar does, but that is not enough because calling a function and getting back some future result is only a really simple use-case, whereas in practice you get streams of messages and the communication is a bidirectional ping-pong.<p>So you work a lot with context become/unbecome [2], which is very much like what you&#x27;d do in Erlang for evolving state. This is because modeling a communication protocol requires multiple stages and a constant dialog with the other side. Even in a simple producer/consumers relationship you need back-pressure. Pretending that the communication is somehow synchronous is not going to fix the non-deterministic nature of this process and the logic will end up looking mostly the same. This is because it&#x27;s not the asynchronicity that bites you ;-)<p>Quasar cannot make blocking I/O to not block threads, although it&#x27;s clearly stated in the article, but that&#x27;s just wrong. You can indeed patch connections to work with Quasar&#x27;s fibers, working much like how you patch sockets in Python with gevent, so you can create your own JDBC data-source that plays nice, but that&#x27;s not the same thing.<p>This really means that your pieces of I/O logic are still separated into blocking and non-blocking (red versus blue) and I&#x27;d rather see which is which by seeing `Future[T]` or `Observable[T]` in my function signatures. Therefore I disagree that Quasar code is more readable, but at least I&#x27;m willing to admit that YMMV.<p>Also, that Quasar actor given as an example has nothing to do with the actor model. This is because in the actor model the actors are untyped. If you type your actors, then you&#x27;re not talking about the actor model anymore and you&#x27;d be better off with another computational model. At the moment it is completely futile to try to type state machines that work in a non-deterministic highly concurrent environment. And if you go through the effort of typing those actors, then you have to at least recognize that actors can communicate with multiple other actors at the same time and thus expose multiple interfaces. And then you can say that at the very least your typing says something more useful than Object or String.<p>I could write more, but I got tired.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/scala/async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scala/async</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/actors.html#become-unbecome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/actors.html#beco...</a>",1432242895

9585395,comment,9584325,9584988,0,0,wayfarer2s,,,"I think you are right in that other inputs are needed to decipher meaning. Humans for example tend to have quite a lot of different sources of input -- as when we are children and learning new words we have the spelling (visual), how it sounds (auditory), and possibly another image that shows what the thing means (&quot;cat&quot;). Or maybe we have the auditory (&quot;mommy&quot;) and the visual (the child&#x27;s mother). If you were trained strictly on text, then the meaning of concepts is harder to decipher. It might be why abstract concepts like higher level math are hard for a lot of people to grasp -- their only exposure to the concepts is usually just in the form of text.<p>As an exercise, when I think of the word &quot;circle&quot;, images of circles and spheres show up in my head. Also the equation of a circle. My quick definition of it would be &quot;a perfectly round object&quot; which leads to questions of what &quot;round&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot; mean. The more I think about it, all my knowledge seems quite circular in that there are no axiomatic concepts, everything is relative and it just builds on itself. I wonder if that&#x27;s the key to decipher meaning, increase the connections of the web -- with strong enough references you can pinpoint which of the nodes in the web something refers to.",1432242596

I&#x27;m going to be harsh and call that negative externalities for Tor users.<p>And I&#x27;m not sure that product even works as advertised - a scan of the internet can reveal the backend server, which could still be hacked (probably even more so, if the customer is now relying on Cloudflare to protect it).<p>It seems we&#x27;re talking about automated attacks only? Else the attacker could just fill out the captcha manually first.<p>If a targeted attack can be detected (attacker has completed the captcha), just rely on that code instead? If not, have we gained much?<p>Clearly a lot of customers will have blindly cranked their s3cur1ty bar to 11. Perhaps make it harder for a customer to do that, given the adverse impact it currently causes? Most people probably think DoS when they head to Cloudflare, not free captchas.<p>Note that I do mean &quot;common case&quot;, because its weakens the anonymity set when normal people are hassled out of Tor. So just making &quot;GET /boring-article.html$&quot; work would be a great improvement. If that then lead to a work-flow of &quot;POST /comment&quot; -> 403, user notices, hits refresh and fills out a magically-appeared captcha, then so be it.. Tor users would learn this flow quick enough, and prefer it.<p>I could totally ask and suggest ideas about this all day for free, but I won&#x27;t be applying to Cloudflare for the time being fwiw :P Still, I&#x27;m grateful you&#x27;re working on the issue.",1432242185

Or are you going to just argue that &quot;only making something of use is work&quot;. If that&#x27;s the case, you obviously have a twisted world-view, and debating it is pointless with you.<p>I agree. Leading is a skill. But leading is not a skill that justifies an astronomical portion of the pie. I would say between coding and leading, coding is a far more specialized skill that is harder to learn and find. In short, it is far easier to tell people what to do then it is to do it. This statement grossly simplifies what leadership and coding is, but the basic premise still stands.<p>Also you should note that the skills needed to gain a leadership position versus actual leadership skills are not congruent. There are many people in leadership positions who  are bad leaders yet get unfairly high compensation simply due to their perceived rank.<p>This illustrates another problem in our society. We have a hard time identifying leaders. Leadership is perceived to be a commodity skill but I would argue that many people can do it. How do you know the janitor or garbage man if given the right opportunity can&#x27;t be a great leader for a fraction of the price of current average CEO salaries? We don&#x27;t know. But if it were true, then that means leadership is not a commodity skill and therefore not justified to be associated the extravagant compensation that is often paid out to people who possess such said &quot;skills.&quot;",1432242124

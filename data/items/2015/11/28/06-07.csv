Going from an FX-8350 to an i7-4790K was a significant power/heat improvement, for a faster CPU.  The i3-5010U in my htpc is pretty awesome for what it does as well.<p>It really depends on the tasks if you <i>NEED</i> it... I wouldn&#x27;t to a byo nas ever again... I would suggest that a lot of workloads don&#x27;t need it.<p>That said, the additional cost should be nominal at this point, and I don&#x27;t quite get why it isn&#x27;t standard.

I&#x27;ve implemented Google maps before and frankly it was a very basic experience with a completely unsustainable pricing model. It would not surprise me in the slightest if Mapbox forces Google to change their maps API or to drop the product all together.<p>Side note: I got a chance to hear from the CEO of Mapbox once and he came across as a really stand-up and hard-working guy. The company has a great story and was almost entirely bootstrapped, only recently taking major funding (they&#x27;ve been around for awhile). This alone will cause me to explore their product offerings when it comes time for my company to implement some map stuff.",1448693728
10640295,comment,10637514,10640125,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Incandescent bulbs which mostly emit light in the yellow–red part of the spectrum are much better for nighttime lighting, because they make less glare in your peripheral vision (which is dominated by rods and “S” cones), have less effect on night vision (short-wavelength light causes the eyes to become bright-adapted, making the rods completely useless), and cause less disruption to sleep cycles (Melanopsin is less sensitive to longer wavelengths). Furthermore, incandescent bulbs have a nice smooth spectrum, which in my experience results in better preservation of color relationships.<p>LEDs can be okay if you make an effort to find ones which are ~3000K CCT, and diffuse them properly. Fluorescent bulbs are invariably unpleasant, and tend to give me a headache, in addition to making everything look garish.<p>LED car headlights and streetlamps of CCT >3000K should be illegal, they’re much too bright in the short-wavelenth part of the spectrum, blinding drivers and pedestrians, disrupting people’s sleep (and animals and plants), creating nasty light pollution which blacks out the stars, and not actually improving visibility compared to less-blue LEDs or high-pressure sodium lamps. Same goes for flashlights and camping lamps, though those probably shouldn’t be literally illegal, just discouraged.<p>I hope someday display technology improves a bit and can support broader spectrum output with more than three isolated/intense primaries. Ink on paper is much nicer to look at than pixels on current screens. (Of course screens have the nice feature that they can easily change what they show.)<p>For daytime lighting a carefully constructed LED lamp might be better than incandescent lamps, but I much prefer just sitting near a window.",1448693669

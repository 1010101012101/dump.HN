Over 650 terabytes of messages are then consumed daily, which is why the ability of Kafka to handle multiple producers and multiple consumers for each topic is important. At the busiest times of day, we are receiving over 13 million messages per second, or 2.75 gigabytes of data per second.

You express them cryptically and meditate on them in a deliberately obfuscated way, or dismiss them for the moment. You do not allow that knowledge to throw you around. That doesn&#x27;t mean that you don&#x27;t act on the knowledge at all(which is how epistemic learned helplessness is presented here), so much as it does that you can proceed to find paths to acting on it that are indirect and do not trip your insanity alarms.<p>Culture itself demonstrates this property. It changes rapidly enough, but it does so gradually, most of the time. Reality in the year 1985 meant something recognizable yet quite a bit different - in food, fashion, and music, in cultural attitudes, politics, and should-you-says, and in everyday usage of time and activities. Some of the things that were taken seriously then are dismissed now, and some of the things that were laughable then are taken very seriously now. And in the 30 years that transpired, many of the same people are still around, but nearly all have changed their status and outlook in some way. Many have led reasonably content lives while doing so.

It&#x27;s meant to be a 1:1 drop-in replacement for CSV. It solves the ambiguity and encoding issues of CSV by recycling XML&#x27;s solutions. It has basically two tags: <c/> and <n/>, for comma and newline, respectively.<p>Unfortunately, it needs a root element to be valid XML, so wrap the document in <xsv></xsv>. Also, add an XML declaration.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>  <?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?>\n  <xsv>one<c/>two<c/>three<n/>1<c/>2<c/>3<n/></xsv>\n</code></pre>\n(Whitespace is passed-through, therefore it&#x27;s significant.)<p>This solves the ambiguity problems of CSV without complicating CSV by introducing things like data types (I think the virtue of CSV is its simplicity), and it should be extremely simple to write parsers based on either SAX or DOM (, etc).<p>Also, the use of XML provides unobtrusive places to insert application-defined metadata, for example:<p><pre><code>  <xsv columns=&quot;3&quot;>\n</code></pre>\nThis remains backwards-compatible with parsers that ignore attributes.",1443253204

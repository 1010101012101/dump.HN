That&#x27;s gevent!<p>That&#x27;s right - I wrote that they allow writing code in synchronous fashion and I didn&#x27;t say that it happens automagically though.<p>> That might be true, but then you need to keep in mind that callbacks doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean something-looking-like-the-Tornado-callback-demo-code.<p>Yep, I also provided how Futures and generator-based coroutines can be built on top of the callbacks.<p>Just in case, Tornado supports both out of the box.<p>> The twisted equivalent of this wouldn&#x27;t even look like data = yield get_more_data(); Twisted&#x27;s API calls you when there&#x27;s data, so it looks even simpler<p>Very similar to some Tornado API too - method of a class that gets called when something happens. For example, sockjs-tornado follows this convention.<p>> - Twisted predates PEP-8&#x27;s recommendation of snake_case ;-)<p>Yes, I&#x27;m aware of it, but before I started playing with asynchronous libraries, I had some Python experience and got used to underscore naming convention. While it is easy to switch between both, I&#x27;d prefer consistent code style. Especially when I mix typical Flask Web application with real-time portion in same application.<p>No doubt, Twisted is mature and featureful framework. When I was investigating different options, Twisted was first one I tried. However, I also tried Tornado and found it easier to start with.

5938088,comment,5936238,5937990,1,0,otoburb,,,"Fixed price bids are better when you&#x27;ve already established a working relationship with your buyer. A good way to establish a working relationship is by starting off fixed-price if the scope is narrow enough and explaining that T&M is more likely to be more expensive for the buyer based on the scope.<p>Usually this results in the buyer either:<p>(i) asking for a lower price;<p>(ii) disagreeing with the FP bid and going T&M;<p>(iii) walking away.<p>The basic assumption is that scope is narrowly enough defined. If it isn&#x27;t, then try hard to narrow the scope and give the deal 1 to 3 hrs for this exercise (depending on your available hours classified for business development aka &quot;biz dev&quot;). At this point, hopefully you&#x27;ve got the requirements narrow enough that you can then engage in the exercise above after coming up with an estimate or quote.<p>If (i), then roughly itemize and remove items to bring the price down to change the value proposition. Avoid keeping scope the same and bringing price down, or else this is a plain discount pure and simple and hurts you down the road.<p>If (ii), then the follow-up move for future deals with the same buyer is to clearly show why their final T&M billables could have been cheaper if they&#x27;d gone with FP.<p>If (iii), count yourself lucky. Nothing harder than letting business go until you get yourself into a deal where your costs are higher than revenue (aka. negative margin deal).<p>>>Fixed-price jobs generally take double the time (losing me half)<p>... that sentence implies a pattern of failed FP deals and lack of scope. However, I am empathetic because other clients have stated that they are uncomfortable with code sprints on a professional services basis solely because of the lack of concrete deliverables that can be used as payment milestones or triggers.<p>Code sprints are better off billed on a T&M basis unless, as you say, the client <i>really</i> understands what they&#x27;re doing.  In most cases, buyers don&#x27;t know what they want, which is why some time must be spent on building on biz dev building the pipeline.",1372146160

Examples:<p>* Recursive queries can update, insert, or delete rows.  This is a huge win over doing it in Activerecord with large data sets.  I&#x27;ve done updates and inserts in under an hour that testing with Activerecord indicated would quite literally take days.  It&#x27;s not really black magic, but you have to actually learn SQL instead of simple selects to use this properly.<p>* Pg&#x27;s query optimizer with a recursive query & internal data handling is much higher performance than anything Activerecord can portably produce (or produce at all) even if you&#x27;re lucky enough not to have to retrieve most of your results.  Preloading is fine for small data sets, but by the time you hit a few hundred thousand rows you&#x27;re going to start feeling it.  This is one of those places where SQL as set handling and Activerecord as ORM diverge more than just conceptually.<p>* Pulling up rows more than a few step away from the parents (especially through other tables) tends to move a lot of unnecessary data over the network with preloading and can produce ridiculous joins.<p>* &quot;WITH RECURSIVE&quot; can do things Activerecord can&#x27;t without multiple costly queries round-tripping their results to the client, getting processed there, and fed back into more queries.

Usually someone posts a reply friendly reminding that this sort of behavior is not welcome. This helps both the offender in question and lurkers to understand how to behave.<p>Then, at some point, people just snap. They&#x27;ve got enough, they don&#x27;t want to help new people any more. Even though it has always been like that. Obviously, as the site grows faster users stepping out of line happens more often.
So they start making &#x27;everything&#x27;s getting worse&#x27; posts. They are perpetuating the idea that all hope is lost.<p>So let me propose to try and tell people why they&#x27;re wrong instead of just making a global assertion, even if true.

I&#x27;ve found that reading blog posts and forums about loneliness tends to make things worse (not really a surprise there), and getting involved in a coding project makes things better (again not too surprising).

    f:  a -> (-b) -> (-a) -> b -> a
</code></pre>
And conversely, any such function is uniquely described by such a partition. That&#x27;s all there is to it!<p>There is no such partition on the set of int32_t&#x27;s, because the # of nonzero int32_t&#x27;s is odd.<p>For the set of all integers Z, the &quot;obvious&quot; partition is {(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)...}. This is what many of the answers are getting at with even/odd tests.<p>This also works for some subsets of the integers, such as {-2,1,0,1,2}. These are the symmetric ones with an even number of positive elements. These have 4n or 4n+1 elements total, depending on whether they include zero. [-2^31, 2^31] works (this has one more element than int32_t). As does [-2^31 + 2, 2^31 - 2] -- the largest such subset of int32_t.<p>This has a natural extension to the rationals, the reals, etc. Namely: (a,b) is a member of the partition iff (floor(a), floor(b)) is a member of the partition for integers, and their fractional parts are equal.<p>There is no such function on the reals that is (analytically) continuous. Any such f must be bijective (a != b implies f(a) != f(b)). If f : R -> R is both continuous and bijective, it is monotonic, and therefore so is (f . f), which is incompatible with the requirement that (f . f)(x) = -x.",1372144431

Using AWS to run a game or other toy app is reasonable.  Using AWS if you yourself are a USG entity (and thus immune to lesser legal action) is fine.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine using AWS (or any outsourced cloud provider) to run sensitive apps using current EC2-type technology in the current legal climate in the US.  The other scary thing is AWS is probably among the best providers for technical security, and still has this vulnerability (disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t yet checked out Google Cloud Engine much).<p>Colocation or managed hosting is borderline in some situations too (particularly if you allow the provider unlimited access to singleuser mode on your boxes, don&#x27;t encrypt drives, manage keys and credentials through the provider, etc.), but it&#x27;s a lot better than virtual hosting for anything at all sensitive.<p>It&#x27;s not just official USG action to fear; it&#x27;s provider staff or technical compromise as well.",1372144078

It seems like every 2 months I have to stop visiting hacker news and proggit while another one of these seemingly intuitive but unsupported link-bait blog posts comes around followed by a deluge of links saying NUH-UH.<p>Here's the thing, if there is no research supporting your intuition, it's just bullshit.  Bullshit is all fine and good until it gets repeated as fact, after that it hurts our professional integrity and enforces biases and discrimination.  Fucking stop it.",1357095562

It's essentially a matter of definition. The rational numbers have probability zero of being drawn, but they still lie in the sample space.<p>One way to see it is this: The probability of picking any particular point in the interval is 0. But that doesn't mean that picking that point is impossible. _Some_ point has to show up when you pick one at random.",1357095555

You really shouldn't do this at parties, dude.<p>You don't know how protective someone is of their drink. Just because you might not mind if someone stole your straw does NOT mean that most people feel the same way. For many people, there is something very private about the drink they are holding.<p>Not only that, but the connotations of people who surreptitiously put their hand anywhere close to a drink at a party are NOT good connotations. I don't think these connotations need to be explained.<p>I don't mean to offend you, man. I rarely even comment on Hacker News. I'm just trying to help you understand why many people (I would say the majority) are extremely off put by this behavior. That said, I don't know what context you do this in. Friends are unlikely to hold a negative perception of this, but people you just met in a bar or party situation could hold dangerously negative perceptions of it.<p>p.s. I notice that you are French.

However, I wouldn't want to be in a job where I have to <i>compete on</i> reliability.

Or a wire that should be conducting isn't.<p>If you have spare parts, try them. If you don't, start building a junkbox. If you don't have an exact replacement, swapping in something reasonably similar will show you if that might be the bad part. Learn to test simple components for functionality with a multimeter (it's your BEST FRIEND).<p>The book of experiments you did yourself is the best book to own.

My current project is like that; I've done high-priority team work before, but I asked to be put on something off the critical path both so I could take more professional risks and so I could deal with some personal stuff.<p>My point is that if you can <i>only</i> do work off the critical path, you're marginalizing yourself because such work is by definition ""on the margins"".  And if you ever discover something huge that's worthy of investment, they'll have to take it away from you and give it to somebody reliable to lead so that people can work under him.  (Many startup founders find themselves in this position; they'll come up with a brilliant breakthrough and then VCs will kick them out and hire an outside CEO because they're fucking up the company.  Hell, that's basically what happened to Steve Jobs at Apple the first time around.)",1357092182

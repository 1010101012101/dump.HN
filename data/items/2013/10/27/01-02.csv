Machine and human translations can be ordered via our web interface.<p>Why is this cool? It generally takes an engineer at least 1-2 weeks to fully localize a website (go through all template files, replace all text with string keys, build a workflow for updating phrases, ordering translations, etc), and once the system is in place, editing template files and adding new text to your app is a pain. Localizejs automates this with a copy and paste js snippet.

6620262,comment,6616817,6617973,1,0,ANTSANTS,,,"I agree with your argument about 1-based indexing being more intuitive for people with more math than programming experience. I&#x27;d even concede that, given Lua&#x27;s history (as I understand it) as a tool for engineers at PUC-Rio, it would be strange if they hadn&#x27;t adopted that convention. Lua is not just any &quot;scripting&quot; language trying to isolate itself from the rest of the world, though. Today it is arguably the most popular language for embedding purposes. It&#x27;s typically used in reasonably large C or C++-based applications as a layer of easily and dynamically reconfigurable glue between components. As such, a large portion of its users are directly involved in maintaining the interface between the C and Lua worlds in their programs, to a much greater extent than with most other dynamic languages. Differing from C&#x27;s convention for any reason is a small but constant source of annoyance and occasional bugs when working at this level. You accept the difference and learn to work around it, but it&#x27;s yet another dumb-mistake-causing source of unnecessary cognitive load that seems out of place in a language mostly free of that characteristic.<p>I think Lua&#x27;s 1-basedness is a valid complaint for embedders. It&#x27;s not a huge problem, it can be worked around. However, if the Lua devs (or Mike Pall) decided tomorrow that from then on out, Lua(JIT) would use 0-based indexing by default, it would only make my work easier.",1382835879

This definition avoids all of the technological complexities of remote working (i.e., VPN into another country, or through multiple countries).  It has also been adopted by the vast majority of countries which you would want to visit.<p>I.e., for example, if you code a $1 million project for a client, half in the US and half while traveling in France, you could owe France income taxes on 50% of that 1 million.

744673,comment,743860,744603,0,0,Goladus,,,"The M&M test is very specific.  If you see brown M&Ms, it means they didn't read the contract carefully or take the details seriously.  That in turn means something important and potentially dangerous is likely to be seriously wrong.  The snopes article states that experience confirms this prediction.<p>The ""how many gas stations in the US"" question is nothing like the brown M&Ms test.  It is not testing anything nearly so specific, nor is it as easily confirmed by experience.  At best you're taking a subjective interpretation of a creative answer and comparing it to subjective performance down the road.  And even if you don't consider the inherent subjectivity, it's hard to document a reasonable number of positive and negative test cases; and even then controlling for other variables is essentially impossible.<p>Van Halen used the test to predict performance conditions for a specific date and venue.  The gas stations answer is used to predict the behavior of a person for a significant period of time.",1249525826

If you're applying to hundreds of jobs and just sending your resume to everyone our process will definitely filter you out. When we advertise online for a job we're usually looking for one or two key skills and we're very careful to spell out exactly what we want (e.g. a relevant university degree and at least X experience with Y technology) and still we get HUNDREDS of applications from people with no degree and no experience with the technology we're after.<p>More recently we've begun to filter applications like this, and now instead of 200 applications in the first 48 hours we probably get 6 or 8 - but all of those match our requirements. Sure we could be missing out on some awesome person but it's not worth my time looking through 200 applications to find him.",1249525755

744670,comment,744572,744592,0,0,yannis,,,"I agree the analogy is not right. Firstly I disagree that the Art of Software Engineering has disappeared or gone down or lost. Yes it is continually morphing and yes it has its own problems. I have been involved in both 'construction' worlds for over 20 years and the analogy is misplaced.<p>'We need an AutoCAD like tool for designing software blueprints.'<p>No you don't. Autocad replaced manual drafting and took some of the drudgery of detailing out, but has made construction more 'inefficient'. The ease of change has actually slowed down construction. Project after project in fast growing areas such as the Middle East has been slowed down by 'design' problems. One hi-rise in Doha has actually tilted by over 300 mm and if a solution is not found it will be demolished (50 storey building). Most Construction Projects use Primavera for planning, one such Project that I am involved with has 22,000 activities. No-one is using it, due to its sheer volume and the actual plan itself is behind the reality on Site!<p>What Software Engineering and Construction need are better tools to manage teams (not tweet!), tools to manage complexity (not just to-do lists) and tools to manage re-usability and generation of some of the code. You can use Autocad to 'draw' out a building floor, produce a blue-print for an aircraft engine or draw out a cartoon. For me a computer language is my 'Software Engineering Tool'. The 'design methodology and other tools' reside in the computer that lives in my head!",1249525515

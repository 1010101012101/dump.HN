He didn't pop out of a test tube and into the Eagle, and sure, lets say thousands of people were equally qualified. That's about 0.00002% of of the population, and puts him in the top 0.1% of the people that could have done what he did (i.e. he did it).",1346572697

4466515,comment,4465501,4465802,2,0,smsm42,,,"This is what is happening now, when there are still some people who pay cash. Imagine how complex and impossible to understand this system will become once there would be virtually no people paying cash as there would be public insurers of last resort. No 1/4 cash price lists would exist anywhere - anybody who paid 1/4 price now would pay the full price, provided from the public coffers. Of course, there would also be a need for a huge bureaucracy to check all these payments, argue about them for months, send stacks of papers back and forth, etc. These people would have to be paid, provided with nice benefits and pensions - after all, they work very hard.<p>On the other hand, you will never have to pay out of pocket for it and probably will never ever made to realize there's a payment in there somewhere. You'll pay out of your taxes and you wouldn't even know how much you paid, so nobody would be up for an unpleasant shock of knowing how much all this costs. 23,800 is not going anywhere - these nice people in the hospital still need to be paid, and they don't deserve the pay cut (if anything, many of them consider themselves underpaid and many of them are right), and these machines and medicines must be paid for too. So it still will be paid for. And it's not getting cheaper - remember no more 1/4 prices for anybody at all? Somebody would have to pay for it, or, more precisely, everybody would pay for it, but won't know how much and where it went. Some think it's better this way.",1346572683

4466493,comment,4464647,4465571,2,0,ANTSANTS,,,"I only saw the kind of macros you're probably thinking about (on the order of #define min(X, Y)  ((X) < (Y) ? (X) : (Y))) in kbit.h, but I didn't look at the source to all the components. What klib does seem to use the preprocessor quite a bit for, however, is implementing generic functions and datatypes -- in other words, since the only significant difference between the implementation of a linked list whose nodes have ""payloads"" of 2 bytes, and one where the payloads are twice as large is, at the language level, the size of the respective payloads, we would ideally like some kind of code generating ""function"" that will take a datatype of some size and produce an appropriate linked list implementation. C++'s function templates exist for this sole purpose, but in C, we have to abuse its preprocessor to get a similar result.<p>If you take a look at the source of klist.h, the preprocessor stuff is a bit hairy, but it basically leaves you with a ""compile time function"", KLIST_INIT, that takes a datatype and generates, via simple textual substitution, an implementation of a linked list where each node of the list carries a payload of that datatype. klib_test.c includes a simple usage case.<p>Just to be clear, the preprocessor is generating real functions (inline ones, but functions nonetheless), not simply textually inserting the appropriate list code every time you use one of the macros like kl_next(iter) defined at the end of klist.h.<p>Check out the GCC docs on macros (and particularly, the section on concatenation) to get a better understanding of how klib implements this.
<a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macros.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macros.html</a><p>As for how ""crazy"" it is to do this with the preprocessor, it's just the most convenient alternative in C to manually copying and pasting a generic list implementation yourself and editing in the correct type information, so it's a fairly common practice. You'll know code that <i>really</i> abuses the preprocessor when you see it -- I would advise then to run.",1346571808

Your goal should be to entertain with your project so people want to share and gain belief. Cover the (majority) of the rewards in the text and probably the funding reasons too. Maybe 3 minutes max, a long play time will scare viewers away. Leave reason for them to read and <i>for now just shake their hand</i>.<p>3) Leave a longer timeline - We launched with a 11 day timeline, since we needed to have the funds (14 day wait) and hopefully release close to the next iPhone's release date. Most potential backers probably don't look at the launched date, and <i>when they see your in a single digit days left and have single digit % of backing they might be scared off</i>. (>21 days?)<p>1) Don't do only $1 rewards - This one may sound obvious, but we launched for the first week with backing levels of $1. This was an experiment to see if we could show the casual backer that they were important too, and because as much as the money a community was our goal.<p>I'm pretty sure this hurt our chances of getting support from Kickstarter content managers too, which can be vital to success. <i>Once you're off the front page of ""Recently Launched"" it's difficult to be discovered within the site without their support</i>. We did have coverage of our project on some great blogs and review sites, but convincing a non-kickstarter to become one is much harder than gaining a current Kickstarter.<p>Overall though the Kickstarter was great, and helped push Cobypic closer to shipping, by creating real world deadlines and having us create a support network of press for release. (some are waiting on promo codes though it would be great if Apple had some built in TestFlight feature, as many won't take the plunge)<p>Hopefully that helps anyone that is thinking about Kickstarting in the future.<p>One Last Thing) A Kickstarter url is great for emails and a place new contacts are comfortable visiting.<p>edit: formatting",1346571177

If you structure the code right, I see nothing wrong with putting stuff that many people see as configuration in the code.

It is a pattern, not a framework. But the Spring trend is hard to walk against, it is so strong. I am getting tired of this occupation.",1346569502

Particularly when I'm digging through forums for information, I tend to skip over entries with poor grammar and spelling. Occasionally someone just speaks poor English, but more often this is an indicator that the submitter is unintelligent (or drunk) and their response will not be useful to me.<p>A simple idiot filter might just work as a layer above Google and snip out results with a high percentage of grammatical and spelling errors.  A more refined one (probably a browser plugin) would act on content within pages and hide or dim unintelligible blocks.  If the focus was on forums, I don't think it would be too hard to come up with an algorithm for guessing what encompasses a single user's submission by analyzing the structure of the page.<p>What do you guys think?  Anyone want to work on it with me?",1322787185

So what's the difference between meaningful braces and meaningful indentation?<p>To that you replied that the output of the Tab key depends on context, and implied that in your editor(s), sometimes the result of the Tab is invisible, and/or cannot be reversed by hitting Delete (or Backspace).  And snprbob86 pointed out that in his/her editor (and mine), this isn't a problem.  Tab never does anything invisible, and it's always reversible with Backspace.  So what's the problem?<p>And although I assume you noticed this too, just to be clear and err on the side of explicitness, it seems to me that that there're two things going on here.  One half is arguing about whether or not there's a fundamental problem with significant indentation that is not present in languages without significant indentation, and the other is an attempt to solve non-fundamental problems that others might have (e.g. complicated state in tabs, possibly due to using a poor editor).",1322786987

The author uses those to attempt to prove a different point than the rest of the article discusses, and it is a bad point. There's a difference between saying ""Someone is probably a 'good' skeptic if they have said something that the mainstream disagrees with"" and saying ""Someone is probably a 'bad' skeptic (charlatan?) if they have said something the mainstream agrees with that I disagree with."" Even if that label is only personal (as you quote, he's not trying to make everyone apply the same labels to those people) it is a bad way to apply it.<p>However, I also find the whole idea of a ""skeptic test"" a bit disquieting. Paraphrasing what you quoted above: ""Don't give someone credit for being a smart, rational skeptic until they have defended some non-mainstream belief, until they have stuck their neck out to say something a little less usual.""

At least their websites look that way. Small business Photography sites are notorious for overly long Flash intros, gratuitous effects, and generally just bad accessibility and SEO due to the overuse of Flash.<p>I love this idea. It's modern, looks great, it's easy, and the sites aren't a mess of Flash. I mean, don't get me wrong, Flash has its place and I can understand why so many photographers gravitate toward it but a lot of times I see user experience go by the wayside as they focus on making everything flash, fade, pop, fly, etc.<p>I do web development for a living and I always cringe when I see services like this because I feel like they're the competition. People see cheap beautiful and easy templates for $12/month and then a custom website for a minimum of $1300 and they're very likely to choose the former.

The first client was free, number 2 was a $400 job and now it's not uncommon to ask for $4,000. That's 10 times the income. As it stands I work from home so my only overhead is my phone line, Internet connection, and any equipment and software I may need from time to time plus web hosting.<p>There's a guy in town offering ""free rent for good ideas"". I called and he's looking for viable businesses to take the space for free. The idea is that since this economy is so crappy he's willing to help people out by giving them the space free for as many months as he believes they need to turn enough profit to pay rent. After the free period, the rent would incrementally increase until it reaches a maximum of $1500/month.<p>After speaking with me he thinks I may be right to take the space but I'm wary. I can do fine without an office and don't think I absolutely need it but at the same time I feel that having a public store front increases credibility, visibility, professionalism, and that there's the possibility that having the office would boost my profits to a point where I can actually afford it when it's time to pay rent.<p>Is this magical thinking?

Short version: If you're an emacs veteran, tramp is the ssh version of ange-ftp. Long version: was down in the San Diego area for Thanksgiving and my development environment (Linux) was up here in San Francisco. Had ssh and VNC access to my Linux server in SF, however the latency was still pretty bad making VNC just barely usable. However I had access to a Mac in San Diego with MacPorts X11 emacs installed. I could then run emacs locally and use tramp to transparently access my remote files via ssh just like the old ange-ftp package. Another benefit is that running a shell within emacs with current tramp buffer will automatically ssh to that same server. Tramp would also work with version control (in this case svn). So the big wins here: 1) local editing speed. 2) efficient network communication (only the file data is transferred) 3) shell and version control support 4) can still use emacs.<p>YMMV.<p><a href=""http://www.gnu.org/s/tramp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/s/tramp/</a>",1322784938

Offices in San Francisco, Boston, and Menlo Park.<p>Delphix is a data virtualization company that does for databases what VMware did for servers -  this is a massive market, and we are on track for similar success. The product is unique and provides huge value to our users - in our first year of selling, we have already added 30 large corporate customers, including many of the Fortune 500 (Proctor & Gamble, Staples, Qualcomm, etc.). The engineering team is top notch, which includes inventors and architects of the VMware platform, Oracle RAC, Sun ZFS file system, and DTrace. We believe database virtualization is the next frontier for achieving 100x payback in IT, and Delphix is leading the way.<p>Delphix engineering sits at the nexus of three core technologies: databases, operating systems, and the cloud.  We've taken the best and brightest across the industry and built an engineering culture where anyone with a good idea has a voice and can drive unique projects with the backing of a wealth of knowledge and experience.  Whether its developing new abstractions in the filesystem, designing an architecture to inter-operate with a novel database, or developing a new cloud paradigm for structured data, there is no lack of hard problems and opportunities at Delphix.<p>WANTED (intelligent/creative/passionate problem solvers)<p>Do you want to work with brilliant people in a culture where creativity and clarity of thinking is encouraged and rewarded?  Are you interested in working on the Data, the next big problem in Data Center?  Do you thrive on solving difficult technical challenges?  Do you take pride in writing beautiful code with a strong attention to detail?  Then we are looking for you!  Engineers who strive to master their craft; generalists who want to contribute at all levels of the application, from the database to the client and all things in-between.

Well healed competitors from other markets will enter a market where they see monopoly pricing power and begin to compete to grab a piece of a high margin business.  Disruptive technologies or methods are also in play.  In order for a company to successfully buy it's way into a monopoly, it requires that all other competitors (and potential competitors) either acquiesce to being bought or not enter the market after the monopoly has been created.<p>Certainly there can be barriers to entry, but those barriers will not be permanent.",1322784241

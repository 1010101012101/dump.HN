Everything that ships to users these days -- traditional desktop software, web apps, even static blogs -- is much larger than it needs to be to achieve its functionality.<p>This isn't necessarily a bad thing.  There's a huge tradeoff between size of the product and development speed.  We've switched to a pattern of bundling lots and lots of large libraries with everything we ship, and tons of static resources, and tons of translations, and on and on.  And it makes everything huge.<p>But it means you ""full-stack engineers"" can knock out full-featured, money-making web apps in hours/days/weeks instead of weeks/months/years.  Most of the ""look at the monetized product I wrote this weekend!"" posts that show up on HN could be a fraction of their size, but would have taken much longer to develop.<p>The link is specifically complaining about resource files, which are probably easier to manage than libraries, but it's still probably not worth the effort for Apple.  By making it as simple as possible, developers don't waste any time worrying about how they are going to structure resource usage for their app.  Just throw everything in there and get on with it.<p>At work, I develop for platforms with <1MB of RAM, and we can do plenty with them, but development time is ridiculous.

However, I would be interested to see how the assets' size stacks up against the actual binary.<p>Some of the biggest apps on my iPhone are iBooks (57.9MB) and Nook (51.3MB). I doubt their pretty little icons take up the lion's share of that size. I mean, Kindle does it in a measly 23.5MB (sarcasm, still big). I wonder, for instance, how much language support weighs in at. There was a mac program I used some years back called monolingual that would remove other languages, you know because I'll never need my laptop to work in Farsi, and thin the binary architectures. Saved many a GB when they were much more precious.<p>I'm assuming that most of these apps are made with some fancy service that generates an app for every platform under the sun from one app creator program, and as such, each native app is way bloated.<p>But, the consumers don't notice or care, so app creators are just going to be as inefficient in the interest of jamming new features into an app over optimizing it.<p>(edit: spelling, added parenthetical to Kindle app)",1333863784

3813192,comment,3812907,3813125,5,0,lunaru,,,"Agree. It seems the OP is just moving from one language to another rather than from one domain (back-end) to another (front-end).<p>If you're learning JavaScript to get familiar with front-end and UI, Node.js is just a distraction. Instead, my advice is to learn raw HTML/CSS/JS without frameworks.<p>You know those cheesy web-based ""OSes""/Desktops that no one really uses? Building one is actually quite helpful to developing JavaScript skills. Try building a Window manager in HTML/CSS/JS. You'll go through the entire gauntlet of what JavaScript has to offer (e.g. closures, prototypes) while dealing with a practical front-end problem (DOM manipulation, CSS styling) while learning a lot about why the modern js frameworks are so useful (e.g. jQuery for DOM, backbone.js for MVC). You'll also start getting exposure to some basic decisions that make up the foundations of a good UI sense. I consider this sort of exercise much more appropriate for polishing front-end skills.<p>Other possible exercises include re-implementing common jQuery UI components - drop-down menus, trees, tabs, etc. But do them without jQuery. It might sound like reinventing the wheel, but learning fundamentals sometimes requires retreading worn out paths.",1333863611

I wonder whether the GDS team have any thoughts on how to reconcile some of this advice, and indeed their own site, with the EU cookie rules?<p>It seems the GDS also has a document floating around[1] that talks about implementing the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations on public sector web sites. This in turn cites ICO guidance[2] that says the Information Commissioner is ""unlikely to prioritise"" regulatory action against sites for using first party analytical cookies.<p>On the other hand, there is nothing in the actual Regulations to exempt analytics as far as I can see, and that same ICO guidance quite clearly states that ""A first party analytic cookie might not appear to be as intrusive as others that might track a user across multiple sites but you still need consent"". Moreover, using a service like Google Analytics, which relies on third party cookies and tracks users across sites, seems to have been squarely in the crosshairs of the EU authorities when they wrote the Regulations.<p>I'll be the first to agree that the current rules are not the most helpful idea I've ever encountered, and I'm about as convinced by the mess at the top of the ICO's own web site as anyone else, apparently including the webmasters of just about every other UK government web site. Still, as long as the Regulations have the force of the law and as long as the moratorium on regulatory action is due to end soon, it seems odd that the GDS is advocating the use of tools like Google Analytics.<p>[1] <a href=""http://alphagov.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/gds-cookies-implementer-guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alphagov.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/gds-cookies-impl...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ico.gov.uk/news/latest_news/2011/~/media/documents/library/Privacy_and_electronic/Practical_application/guidance_on_the_new_cookies_regulations.ashx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ico.gov.uk/news/latest_news/2011/~/media/document...</a>",1333861591

Again, some folks hold the code in their mind and do a very good job of making perfect incremental changes, only moving forward, no regressions.

That's the realm of supporting transit - busses, subways, light rail, etc.  They're <i>far</i> more valuable going directly between commerce centers, where there are reasons for people to travel, and where supporting transit will actually be used to get to/from the center (since nobody actually <i>lives</i> there).<p>If the high-speed rail were put in, and that great mass of people would use it, there would be money in providing transit between the rail and the great mass of people.

3813128,comment,3812920,3812920,26,0,robomartin,,,"I have a feeling that Apple might just start to run into the kinds of realities MS and others have been living with for years.  Either they choose to piss off millions of users of older devices or figure out how to allow for evolution without causing problems for the installed base.  Or, maybe they don't.<p>As an iDevice user I am glad that I chose to buy all my devices with the absolute max storage available.  Everything I have has 64GB.  So, we are good for a little bit.<p>As a developer I cringe at the situation.  I am currently working on an app that has about 400 graphics files that will ship with the app.  If you  do it their way you have to produce each one of these files in four different resolutions.  This means that the image directory is now huge.  It is three times larger than a scenario where we would have app bundles customized for each device.<p>In looking at the problem we decided to do the following.  All of our files are produced at what would be @2X resolution but are named without the @2X.  We are going to ship the app with just 400 files at a single resolution instead of 1600 files at four different resolutions. In the end, if you do the math, your app bundle will be significantly smaller due to the significant reduction in size of the images directory.<p>As far as performance is concerned, the images work very well all they way back to iPod touch v2.0 devices.  No issues there.  So, that's the plan.<p>Maybe what Apple is pushing all of us towards is a scenario where we are forced to detect device type and capabilities and load resources accordingly on app first run.  Think about this for a moment.  Now their servers don't have to push out so much content and you will have to foot the bill for your free graphics-intensive app getting three million downloads.  I could be off base here.  But, I just don't see a way to deal with this unless you are willing to ship your app with thousands of files, most of which will never be used by the device the app is installed on.<p>I also think it's high time that apple put out an iDevice with the ability to expand memory capacity in the field.  I know, I know, they want to control it all.  They are big enough to have custom Flash chips made with all the encryption they want so people can't move the flash chips from phone to phone and steal software.<p>Happy coding.",1333861402

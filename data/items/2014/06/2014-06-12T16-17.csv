I&#x27;d be happy to signal boost it.<p>> That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying: it is like being pulled into meeting after meeting where the same thing is said over and over -- while you have already implemented the action items and you&#x27;re wondering what good will come from Yet Another Meeting where the only things expressed are ones you&#x27;ve long since agreed to and committed yourself to acting on.<p>I don&#x27;t think you understand what &quot;proactive&quot; means. What you&#x27;re talking about is like getting into your wheelchair everyday and expecting your legs to fix themselves as a result.<p>> while you have already implemented the action items<p>This is the vaguest part of your analogy. What were the action items? If you wanted to improve system performance, and your action item was splitting the engineering department into two groups, how does implementing that help meet the goal?<p>The &quot;meetings&quot; and discussion happen because people disagree on what the action items should be. You feel you know better than everyone else, and that&#x27;s a pretty common sentiment. A company has the luxury of splitting apart or shutting down when people can&#x27;t agree on a strategy to proceed; a society does not, because that generally involves the usual suspects justifying war.<p>Now, it turns out that society is large enough that it has millions of departments, and some of these departments have picked action items to go on. Some of these items worked; some of them were poorly implemented; some of them were well-executed and still failed. The discussion continues because people have drawn different conclusions from these events.<p>Of course, who invited you to the meeting? Why are you here, if you&#x27;re getting no value from it?",1402592357

I would especially think UberX would bother them.  I think in the short term they are happy but I suspect they will start to get more upset if uberX starts to take away business. Right now, its earning them more money.<p>In Florida, they are having issues with UberX for that very reason (<a href=""http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/11/4172680/miami-dade-taxicab-industry-protests.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/11/4172680/miami-dade-tax...</a>).<p>Its interesting to watch a number of industries just get blindsided by these disruptive technologies.\nSeeing it with crowd-sourced cab rides (uberX), direct autosales instead of dealers (Tesla dealer controversy) and crowd-sourced accommodations (airBnB).  Some of the regulations placed on the older players in those spaces were put there to protect the consumer and/or the industry but my take is that consumer choice is providing better options and bypassing the need (or maybe it just hasn&#x27;t come up yet) for these regulations.  But then the people who played by the rules get mad or cling to them if it allows them to maintain their position a little longer.",1402591643

In fact, business models were only considered tangentially in most cases because the general goal was to create an ecosystem of federated identity providers transacting over open protocols. Differentiation would come from the relationship between customers and their providers - charging for background checks to add extra confidence to third-party claims, for example. Or, by selling enterprises more secure identity claim brokers for their employees.<p>> One problem is username and password proliferation. Another is filling out the same information over and over, like phone number, email address, and so on. E-commerce sites will often not bother checking email addresses and not require accounts because unnecessary obstacles drive potential customers away.<p>I&#x27;d love to see the Digital Identity discussion revived, and between high-profile security breaches (Adobe, Target...) and the NSA, I think it might be time.<p>I know you don&#x27;t have or necessarily want a preconceived idea of what a 3rd-party account/identity provider should be, but I encourage you to look at what&#x27;s been done & discussed before.<p>Dick Hardt&#x27;s keynote from the 2006 Identity 2.0 conference is entertaining and informative: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrpajcAgR1E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrpajcAgR1E</a> - it&#x27;s also the talk that got me hooked on Vanilla Stoli for a couple of years.<p>Kim Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Laws of Identity&quot; were the cornerstone of the discussion back them.

Basically if you&#x27;re coding in C/C++ or something that can go thru that route then you can pass it thru emscripten and achieve up to 1.5x performance on the ASM.js based output.<p>This is a really good way to reuse code that was &quot;native&quot; on the web. As of now, you can&#x27;t use .NET or JVM based languages since you don&#x27;t have the VMs for them and IMHO trying to pass the VMs thru emscripten is a recipe for nightmare.<p>The main thing is that everything has its pros and cons. There is no silver bullet. Developing with Swift for iOS appears to be a really good thing. The language is very modern and beautifully integrated but it only works on iOS. Same thing goes for JVM based languages, not all platforms are shipping JVMs (Android, Sailfish, BB10, who else?).<p>If you stop and reason for a bit you will notice that the most powerful integrations and languages are usually tied to a single platform or compiling to some runtime that was compiled for those platforms. Its really hard to create something that works everywhere.<p>Languages are just tools. When you build a beautiful shelf no one asks what was the brand of the hammer used. Lots of programmers tend to mix the process with the solution. Yes the .NET languages are wonderful, specially F# but how can you empower people with it? How can you make something that people can afford and how can you make it simple enough for them to use.<p>There are better languages than Javascript and it doesn&#x27;t matter what is the current pinacle of language design, someone will replace it some day. HTML5 is currently the only toolkit that works web wide and is not controlled by a single company. There is power in standards and also continuity.<p>Just imagine for a bit a poor community classroom. Pick a smartTV from a government program, pick cheap tablets and maybe phones. This vision is getting more common than people think specially in the communities that are close enough to cities but not a part of it. Now what is easier: to pick developers to deliver to all those platforms regardless of OS using HTML5 or create separate teams to build stuff using whatever is the most elegant language on that platform?<p>Firefox OS is not about the process, its not about competing with Android and iOS, its not about pitching JS versus any language, its about creating opportunities and serving people that are currently not served by the other mobile platforms....",1402591322

If you use gpg with any email server, the provider of that service knows that YOU contacted someone (and they know who that someone is). They also know &quot;when&quot; this happened. In fact, if metadata is not a concern, there are other much simpler solutions than using GPG. Technically speaking iMessage (or many other messaging apps) should give you the same result (well, if you trust Apple to be doing what they claim to be doing). With Bittorrent Chat, there is none of that. Bittorrent Inc. does not know who is talking to whom at what time.<p>2- It&#x27;s difficult to use GPG (or OTR, etc) with your friends who are not technical or just don&#x27;t want to spend that much time on sending a message. Honestly, I have rarely used it myself because it&#x27;s just too difficult to get right both on the sending end and the receiving end. A messaging app that intends to be private is not doing a good job if everyone doesn&#x27;t like it (or don&#x27;t know how to use it). Privacy should be accessible otherwise people who need it the most, cannot use it.<p>We are trying to create an app that is not only private but is in fact easier to use than other messaging apps.

It doesn&#x27;t solve everything. Of course there are domains that are better suited for other languages. The fact is that HTML5 is the only toolkit that gets us from computers to mobile platforms, smarttvs, videogames, smartwatches and more. Basically its the most common runtime everywhere and its also the easiest. Don&#x27;t think of Firefox OS as &quot;just a mobile platform&quot; like Android. Think of it as a champion or an extension of the world wide web ecosystem. Its picking what we like from the web and evolving it until it is great on mobile devices as well but without losing the objective of keeping it interoperable with other platforms just like you can open HN on Firefox on Mac OS X or on Midori on Debian/ARM, the interoperable part is key.<p>The phone with the weakest spec I have here is the Alcatel OT Fire. It has 256mb of RAM, 1x Core and yet I can play games at 60 frame a second in it. This, of course, just work if the developer knows how to code for a hardware with such constraints. If a developer code his app on his i7 with 32gb of RAM and dual graphic card without ever thinking of lower hardware then he or she will probably face difficulties when porting to entry level mobile phones.<p>HTML5 mobile gaming is still evolving a lot. Check out <a href=""http://phaser.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phaser.io</a> for a powerful FOSS framework that is able to deliver great performance on entry level phones.<p>Achieving 60fps is not possible in all occasions but achieving interoperability is better. I&#x27;d rather have a poor person pick a smartphone for the first time, learn just enough HTML to build a little app that helps his community and start changing things then having the same person get into debt to buy the latest iOS thing and then be unable to deliver the app for his community because Apple didn&#x27;t like it.",1402590437

For example, find me an example on their site of saving a complex relationship that was newly created by your application. Let&#x27;s take the example of an invoice. Let&#x27;s say you have an Invoice model, and an InvoiceLineItem model in a one-to-many relationship.<p>How do I save the creation of a new invoice (with line items) as a single transaction? As far as I can tell, you can&#x27;t without breaking from Ember Data&#x27;s very strict &#x27;this is the way things should be done&#x27; model.<p>You have to create a new Invoice, then create the InvoiceLineItems doing something like this:<p><pre><code>  var self = this;\n  self.get(&#x27;store&#x27;).createRecord(&#x27;invoice&#x27;, {\n    .. attributes ..\n  }).save().then(function (invoice) {\n    return Ember.RSVP.all(self.get(&#x27;lineItems&#x27;).map(function (item) {\n       return self.get(&#x27;store&#x27;).createRecord(&#x27;invoiceLineItem&#x27;, {\n           invoice: invoice,\n           .. attributes ..\n       }).save();\n    });\n  }).then(function (invoiceLineItems) {\n    // do something\n  }).then(null, function (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n  });\n</code></pre>\nNote that this isn&#x27;t even taking into account how to rollback INSERTs if, for instance a single invoiceLineItem fails to be created.<p>The &#x27;other&#x27; way to do it is to create just an Invoice model, and have a lineItems attribute of type &#x27;raw&#x27; and just create a RawTransform that&#x27;s just as pass-through of whatever the JSON has for that attribute. It works, but at the same time, feels like it&#x27;s going against the Ember Data Way, especially if you have a need for an InvoiceLineItem to be its own model (i.e. to be able to maintain relationships to other things and look one up by ID via the API).<p>Then you might have something like:<p>- Invoice and InvoiceLineItem models<p>- A RawTransform:<p><pre><code>  App.RawTransform = DS.Transform.extend({\n      deserialize: function (data) { return data; },\n      serialize:   function (data) { return data; },\n  });\n</code></pre>\n- An attribute like so (on Invoice model):<p><pre><code>  lineItems: DS.attr(&#x27;raw&#x27;),\n</code></pre>\n- Code that looks like this:<p><pre><code>  var self = this;\n  self.get(&#x27;store&#x27;).find(&#x27;invoice&#x27;, invoiceId).then(function (invoice) {\n    self.get(&#x27;store&#x27;).pushPayload(&#x27;invoiceLineItem&#x27;, { invoiceLineItems: invoice.get(&#x27;lineItems&#x27;) });\n  });</code></pre>",1402590175

I&#x27;ve dug into this, but I can&#x27;t really figure it out without going into the Ember.js internals (which I have done before, but the time sink isn&#x27;t currently worth it). I&#x27;ve boiled it down to the fact that at some point Ember.js stops responding to changes on a particular attribute. Computed properties stop working sooner, but even a .observes(&#x27;attribute&#x27;) stops triggering after 5 or 6 changes.<p>I get that software is not bug-free, but how am I supposed to even debug something like that? It would be fairly difficult (and time-consuming) to boil it down to a simple test case, as this is the only place we&#x27;re seeing this happen and it&#x27;s in a large Ember.js application.<p>- There is no case/switch statement in Handlebars.

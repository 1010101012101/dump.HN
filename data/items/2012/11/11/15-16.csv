It is incapable of going nova. This is an old sci-fi trope, of a civilization that dies because its Sun goes nova, but this isn't a thing that actually happens. There are very specific circumstances where a nova can occur, and it is typically a recurring thing. More so, it requires the presence of a white dwarf star, which must come into existence only after a star has gone into a red giant phase. None of these things are conducive to life developing on nearby planets, they aren't even conducive to the continued <i>existence</i> of nearby planets. Regardless, our star is not a white dwarf, nor does it have a companion and therefore will never produce a nova. More so, it is about 1/8th too small to go supernova.",1352649488

I spent the previous year working in an internship position, and I will graduate at the end of April (about 6 months). I expect that most companies that put up job postings are looking for someone <i>now</i> though. While there are a few larger companies that hire students in advance (like Microsoft and Google), I wonder if I'm wasting my time by applying for jobs now. I've also been somewhat picky in the job that I want, I feel that I'd rather work somewhere that I can grow in an area I'm interested in, rather than just get a job for the sake of earning money.<p>I believe getting work doing something I enjoy, and growing through work experience would be optimal for my future, but I've even thought of attempting freelance work just to ensure I'm doing what I want to do after I graduate (which I haven't even really narrowed down yet, more so I know what I don't want to do). I wonder if I would be better off just getting a job anywhere I can, but worry that it will not lead me down a path I would be happy with. Perhaps I'm naive thinking that I can get everything I want after finishing University, but at the same time I feel that it's an achievable goal and I'd like to set myself up as best as possible to grow.

Many consumer videos are transcoded into a more compact MP4 format - of course you need a specialized device or a PC to watch MP4. Most media players nowadays can support mp4 decoding, however. It's not the same quality as mpeg2, but passable to the casual viewing audience, mp4 uses predictive motion encoding, spatial and temporal compression, and reduced chroma sampling sometimes. Modern video streaming services now all probably use moderate-complexity mpeg4 encoding, resulting in a lower bandwidth. (movies rented from Apple, amazon, netflix, etc). A 1.6 Gbyte mp4 file is decent 720p depending on the scene contents and length of the video, at a fixed bitrate.<p>edit: and it's worth noting that these small video files will typically strip the multi-channel audio and favor a remixed stereo-only sound track. saves more bytes.<p>edit: kudos to poster below for clarifying my half-baked explanation.",1352647908

When I arrived it turns out neither of those was true. The recruitment agent had lied. Wasting a day of my time, and an afternoon of the companies.<p>I know this because the guy who was interviewing was somebody I hired at another company about five years previous to that. I had a lovely time listening to him call up the recruiting firm and rip them a new one. That firm no longer works for him, or for me, at any company we've worked at.

For example, is the formal epsilon-delta definition of a limit the best way to begin a calculus course? Yes, this is logically one of the basic building blocks of the theory, but what value does it have pedagogically for a beginning student? It is known that learning happens to a large degree via associating new concepts with ones already known, what can such a definition be associated with?

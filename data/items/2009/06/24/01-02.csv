671459,comment,671212,671212,0,0,crux,,,"It seems to me that the entire key to having this whole thing work out is if we have as many of these as possible. I think it's great that these guys were willing to put in the effort before Google even brought their product to market. We're looking at a parallel dual network effect here: the product/client (ie, barring any unforeseen, giant occurrences, Google's client) will only take off if it manages to establish a large userbase for an unproven product. BUT: Wave, as a protocol, as a server type—as a web technology rather than a Google tool—will only take off if it manages to establish a large codebase of clients and servers for an unproven protocol. As far as I can tell the one thing that will have the biggest effect in a) ensuring Wave's success and b) actually IMPROVING Wave and shaping it according to the needs of the web at large is if as many people as possible do what PyGo has just done first.",1245808410

First, it's important to watch the Google Video in which the product is introduced.  Wave creates a new family of application categories.  Etherpad is just one _instance_ of one _particular_ application category.<p>My elevator pitch (probably inaccurate, but it's mine) - ""Real Time multi-way fedreated communication that creates secure rich-format conversation.""  It's the Real-Time element + the Multi-Way + the fact that people can drop in on conversations later on that make it exciting.  What got people excited was the open-source nature plus (if I'm not mistaken in my memory) the decentralized aspect - multiple organizations could run their own wave server, so these conversations could be kept entirely internal, or interoperate with external Wave servers.  It has elements of IRC, Instant Messaging, E-Mail, Lotus Notes, and WIKIs all rolled into one.",1245807805

671451,comment,671104,671372,0,0,martin,,,"Agreed that it's not the same sort of situation. MySQL is obviously well known and has significant market share, and although Oracle is a competitor to some extent, Postgres is probably much more similar in terms of who the typical customer is.<p>And anyway, how many people here have heard of Virtual Iron, much less used it? There's good reason for that -- it's really, really bad, or at least it was 6 months ago. We had it for a while because our MIS group was too cheap to buy VMware. Its Java-based frontend was clunky and unstable. VMs would frequently hang when powered down or rebooted through the console, stuck in a ""shutting down"" state that could be resolved only by rebooting the physical box. On a number of occasions, the server inexplicably got in a state where none of the VMs would power on until the box was rebooted. Snapshotting was based on LVM, totally different (in a bad way) from how every other virtualization product I've ever seen works. The ""console"" feature was based on VNC, and as you might guess, extremely slow.<p>After some time, we finally shelled out for VMware ESX/VirtualCenter, which isn't perfect, but still a much better product. I don't know why Oracle bought VI to begin with, but I'm not exactly sad to see it go.",1245807647
671449,comment,671291,671421,0,0,patio11,,,"In web programming the things that will really give you perceptible speed boosts aren't even optimizations so much as ""do it the right way the first time"".<p>How hard is it to configure Apache to gzip your textual content?  That takes, what, four lines?  And it will deliver huge, perceptible boosts to probably six nines of all websites without perceptible downsides?  You should require a note signed by your doctor to NOT have that option turned on.<p>Putting all your JS/CSS in one file takes almost no thought in Rails.  (:cache => true)  If you require multiple sets of included Javascript, you have to make the terribly difficult optimization decision of giving them different names (:cache => ""purchasing_scripts"")  If you're not using Rails, then you might have to actually write code in your build/deploy script, once.  (Then you copy/paste it to every project you ever do, because there is never going to be a time when including 6 CSS files individually is a good idea.)  Looking at our repository it looks like an ANT script can do it in a dozen lines, so it can't POSSIBLY be that hard in your language of choice.",1245807628

671447,comment,660038,660226,0,0,quizzical,,,"I definitely consider it an overreaction to call the described approach over-engineering. Separating simulation and presentation in to separate threads is common and very practical in many games (2d or 3d). It is also common and easy to support a single threaded mode that just runs both simulation and presentation update from one thread. The single threaded mode can make debugging certain issues much easier, but it is rare to have a desire to ship single threaded.",1245807514

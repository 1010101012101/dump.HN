I&#x27;m guessing, though, that you had learned it before from mathematics. My point is one of pragmatic, not theoretical, distinction. To those without a mathematical background (most people are not going to learn monoid unless they&#x27;ve studied abstract algebra), or who are less interested in mathematics in general, an obscure term like that is discouraging. I know that the Haskell community is heavily mathematical, and have little interest in &quot;dumbing down&quot; the language for the sake of those who are put off by theory, but it is a real tradeoff and one of the things that is likely to impede the introduction of Haskell into the mainstream.",1387562330

6942842,comment,6900625,6937913,1,0,kindmatt,,,"I’m new to HN, but I don’t think that this takes away from the points that I’m making.  I think that this conversation is best held in a public forum so people can know the truth rather than sweeping it under the rug.<p>It sounds like you are using the top end of the tolerance of the foam when you say “about.’  Everyone else in the industry uses the target density.  If you want to be totally transparent, give the range of the density like I’ve seen when people talk about ILD or give the target density like everyone else so that people can fairly compare Tuft and Needle’s mattress.  Using the word “about” makes you sound like you are trying to be sneaky.<p>Even though IKEA is a huge multinational company, they don’t manufacture the products.  A true mattress manufacturer would be able to overcome their volume discounts and offer a product for the same price as or less than IKEA.  The Mattress Underground has a list of true manufacturers who I’m sure can easily produce something for less than or at the same price as IKEA.  Fox, Flexus, and Buis are just a few of examples of the real deal.  These are true manufacturers!<p>You are not very knowledgeable in the mattress industry.  Most manufacturers don’t own knitting machines and equipment to pour foam.  The three largest manufacturers in the US don’t even own them.  Tempurpedic buys foam from another manufacturer with the exception of their memory foam.  Sealy, Serta, and Simmons buy their fabric from a weaver and foam from other manufacturers. Mattress manufacturers quilt, cut, sew, and assemble the mattress.<p>Technically you are a contract manufacturer.  You’ve found a factory in California to make the mattress for you.  Just like Apple doesn’t manufacture the IPhone, you don’t make the mattress.  Matt Firm, Sit n Sleep, Sleepy’s and others do the same thing for their private label.  Tuft and Needle doesn’t lease or own a manufacturer facility nor do they own a quilting machine, sewing machines, tape edge machine, etc. You are very slick. To prove my point, if you are truly a manufacturer, does Tuft and Needle own or lease a factory where it only produces product for itself and their customers?  And, do you have the equipment, like sewing machines, on your balance sheet that you depreciate on a yearly basis?  Just be honest and try not to twist the truth.  This is problem with the mattress industry.<p>On Tuft and Needle’s website, it states the typically markup is 1,000%.  The reason that I gave the Matt Firm example is they are largest mattress retailer in the US and the only publicly traded one so we absolutely know their markup.  All the other top twenty mattress retailers operate in this manner.  That type of markup is atypical.  I’d bet you’d be hard press to find one with a 1,000% markup that isn’t based on some myth.  Consumer Reports, <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2010/may/home-garden/mattresses/8-mattress-mysteries/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2010/may...</a>, even mentions that the average gross margin is around 30 to 40% which at most is a 67% markup. On the high end, which Tuft and Needle’s is not based on the comparable from IKEA and others, the markup is 100%.  If you were using memory foam or latex, your argument may be more valid, but even a high density foam mattress is considered a low end mattress.<p>Show me one overpriced 5” foam mattress?    If you are offering factory direct prices, I should be able to find one similar to Tuft and Needle for $800 in a queen given a 100% markup and that Tuft and Needle is selling the mattress to us at the same price that a manufacturer sells it to a retailer.  Please don’t tell me that you sell at lower margins than retailers pay for a mattress from the big brands, who have enormous buying power that would offset your lower margins as you have previous stated in the IKEA example.  At Sears, you can get a 12” gel memory foam bed on sale for $594 which is significantly higher quality than a 5” high density foam mattress. <a href=\"http://www.sears.com/sealy-fergus-falls-ti2-ii-ultra-firm-queen/p-08215881000P?prdNo=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.sears.com/sealy-fergus-falls-ti2-ii-ultra-firm-qu...</a>  I could go on with examples proving my point.<p>Tuft and Needle may offer a different shopping experience, but I think that it is mistruth to talk about the money that customer saves when he/she can buy product of similar quality and durability at a local big chain mattress retailer.<p>You can be a good company selling a mattress made for you.  Just don’t be dishonest and twist the truth like the rest of your brethren in your industry.  It is a disservice to the true small independent manufacturers.",1387562261

One of them is based on years of using similar services in the context of running my own business and then realizing there&#x27;s an interesting approach that could do very well.  The other, as I said in another comment, is one that&#x27;s the result of constantly thinking and being involved in one way or another in a couple of market segments and finally having &quot;seen the light&quot; that connects the two worlds.

6942826,comment,6942145,6942417,118,0,tptacek,,,"So, Dragonfly is a PAKE.<p>PAKEs (&quot;password authenticated key exchanges&quot;) are a kind of public-key algorithm.<p>When two people use public key crypto to exchange a key in public, they need a way to &quot;break the tie&quot; in case of a MITM attacker. The conventional way to do this is with a certificate; that&#x27;s how TLS works.<p>A PAKE uses instead a password; it does that by baking the password into the public/ephemeral key generation process. Alice & Bob can&#x27;t agree on a MITM&#x27;d key if the MITM doesn&#x27;t know the password; they just won&#x27;t come up with the same numbers.<p>Dragonfly is a PAKE designed by Dan Harkins a bunch of years ago. Harkins got Dragonfly added to LEAP, the extensible authentication framework for 802.11 networks. He would very much like it added to TLS as well.<p>The trouble with that is, nobody knows why we would want to add Dragonfly to TLS. TLS already has a PAKE option, SRP. SRP is better than Dragonfly; it&#x27;s designed to make it hard for an attacker who seizes a server to collect a database of passwords. SRP is also well-studied and well-understood; if it isn&#x27;t particularly beloved of academic cryptographers, well, Dragonfly doesn&#x27;t score any better. But more importantly, nobody uses TLS-SRP. No browser implements it. The demand for PAKE authentication in TLS is not strong.<p>It gets worse for Dragonfly. The protocol has problems. I&#x27;m going to get myself into a little bit of trouble summarizing, but here goes: Dragonfly can be made to work with elliptic curve key exchange. The process for mixing a password into an ECC key exchange involves a trial-and-error process for finding a valid curve point; a loop runs conducting these trials. A passive attacker could, in an earlier version of the Dragonfly protocol, discern how many iterations through the loop had happened to find a valid point given a password. Dragonfly is randomized: a nonce is mixed into every exchange. As a result, the same password might take a different number of loop iterations on every login attempt.<p>Net result: given a corpus of 2<i></i>32 passwords, 32-and-change passive observations of the key exchange might uniquely identify the password used!<p>Modifications to the protocol were proposed, some in the CFRG process, but they in turn resulted in a protocol with a side-channel weakness: the process of computing parameters for the key exchange leaks timing information.<p>Dragonfly has one sponsor that we know of: Kevin Igoe on the CFRG.<p>Trevor Perrin broke this down in amazing detail, mining posts out of several IETF mailing lists. Probably nobody is ever going to use Dragonfly in the real world, but watching people pick apart a new crypto protocol in public is amazing and hugely educational. I highly recommend reading this post:<p><a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg10962.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg10962.ht...</a>",1387562146

Ideas that are good\nand early on have solid evidence that they are good\nare rare.<p>Here are some ideas that, just as ideas, should be\nvaluable to VCs:<p>(1) An algorithm that shows that P = NP and is fast.\nWhy?

I&#x27;m betting that a lot of people who&#x27;re right now commenting on this article, and calling him are evil are possibly the people who&#x27;d use Jake just like psychopaths supposedly use mentally normal people. The power differential of a normal, average human being and Jake is comparable to the power differential of a psychopath and a normal, average human. Psychopaths see the weaknesses that can be exploited in normal people; normal people see emotional weaknesses in Jake - and they realize they can make him do whatever they want to, and he&#x27;ll be helpless and voiceless in the end with you having gotten what you&#x27;d wanted from him.",1387562039

You see the need.  You see the pain points and you are equipped to address them.  I could argue that might have been the start of Hewlett and Packard.<p>FedEx is a case of an idea that was discounted and then proven to have been right on the mark.  Some ideas can&#x27;t be tested with $15,000 over a summer.<p>There are other cases where the idea and the market opportunity reveal themselves during some kind of an instant or event that provides the necessary clarity, if you will, that connects the two.  A friend of mine and I had the idea for what eventually became LoJack a year or two before that company came out with their product.  We were young, making very good money at our respective jobs and simply didn&#x27;t have enough of that &quot;clarity&quot; (for lack of a better word) to take the idea seriously.

It&#x27;d be hard to go up against Google or Facebook.  The insight an idea would have to have in order to connect with a market opportunity in search or social would have to be so incredible that people would literally want to throw money at you.  Even with that, it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to even begin to have a shot at that.  For all intents and purposes you can say that ideas in social or search really don&#x27;t have a market because you really can&#x27;t get that market.<p>The other category are ideas that really don&#x27;t have markets, at least in the context of what makes for a good scalable company.  Local restaurants.  Great idea if you want to work 20 hours a day seven days a week, have huge risk of failure, no real scalability and no prospects of any kind of an exit that makes sense.  For some people that would be a market.  If it weren&#x27;t there would be no mom-and-pop local restaurants.  For most ventures that are looking for or need scale in order to be considered successful a mom-and-pop restaurant idea is an idea without a market.<p>I could go on.

Reading too much can just be confusing and might make you feel like an idiot for not understanding it yet. In the beginning it might be weird, and you&#x27;ll no doubt spend a great deal of time puzzling over obscure type errors, but it will eventually become intuitive, if you&#x27;re actually writing code and working through it. Haskell is a theory-heavy language, but it&#x27;s still a programming language, which is actually meant to do things. There&#x27;s no substitute for experience.<p>Perhaps try going through &quot;Write Yourself a Scheme&quot; which uses monads from the outset, or look at &quot;Monad Transformers Step-by-Step&quot; (be warned though, it starts off mostly simple but then makes a sudden and somewhat jarring leap forward). Try to implement a stack with &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pop&quot; monadic operations (use this as a starting point: <a href=\"http://brandon.si/code/the-state-monad-a-tutorial-for-the-confused/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://brandon.si/code/the-state-monad-a-tutorial-for-the-co...</a> but keep in mind it&#x27;s much more important to WRITE the code, and play with it, than to try to understand how it&#x27;s all working just via explanations).<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, here&#x27;s my ten cent explanation of monads:<p>A monad is interface for containers. A type which implements this interface must have two methods, `return` which inserts an object into a container, and `bind` which says what should happen when we use the value in one container to create a new container.",1387561214

This has already been done, e.g., for Java [1] and Lua [2].  What is meant by &quot;supporting GC languages&quot; is translating GC objects in the source language to real JavaScript objects so that the JS GC may be used on them.  For statically-typed source languages like .NET/JVM, the proposed Typed Objects extension to JavaScript [3] could be naturally integrated into asm.js to describe classes.  This is all a little ways off since Typed Objects needs to be standardized first.  Also, the lack of finalizers in JS would limit the fidelity of the translation.<p>For (2): yes, it is already being worked on [4].<p>[1] xmlvm.org\n[2] <a href=\"http://kripken.github.io/lua.vm.js/lua.vm.js.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://kripken.github.io/lua.vm.js/lua.vm.js.html</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:typed_objects\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:typed_objects</a>\n[4] <a href=\"http://badassjs.com/post/43158184752/qt-gui-toolkit-ported-to-javascript-via-emscripten\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://badassjs.com/post/43158184752/qt-gui-toolkit-ported-t...</a>",1387561040

6942610,comment,6941023,6941023,1,0,thrownfaraway,,,"Here&#x27;s my dilemma with transparent salaries:<p>I don&#x27;t live and work in a large metropolitan area. There are maybe half a dozen places that employ developers in the area (in the South BTW), only half of which I would even consider working for. The problem is none are willing to pay. It&#x27;s evident in the number of position ads being posted by third party recruitment companies for these companies and most have undesirable working conditions (hours and environment).<p>I was able to get a job with a company that found itself between a rock and a hard place a few years and so they were willing to pay close to market rates. I took the position because of the opportunity this small company offered. I could probably skip across the street to one of the other companies in town and possibly make 10% more, but I&#x27;d also probably be working 10%+ more hours per week in a department viewed as a &quot;cost center&quot; rather than a revenue generator (where I&#x27;m at now).<p>The founders of the company I work for do not have a technical background and made numerous &quot;classic&quot; mistakes trying to develop their software. They were looking to me for technical guidance and understanding.<p>After I was hired, I was entrusted to internal numbers and salaries. There were a few other in house developers and I was shocked at what they were getting paid (way too little)! I told the founders that we needed to correct this. My biggest fear was if they caught wind of what they could make across the street they&#x27;d jump and then we&#x27;d all be in a world of scramble.<p>I&#x27;m still working and pushing for bringing up salaries and making things more &quot;fair&quot;. However, I&#x27;ve come to learn/realize that one of the developers who was here for a few years before I came and was underpaid is someone I would never ever have hired myself. He was hired because he was fresh out of college and his mother is friends with one of the founders (so I can&#x27;t let him go). Another developer who maybe &quot;underpaid&quot; too complains about not getting paid enough. He &quot;could&quot; go across the street and get paid more except they would never put up with his antics and he knows that we are extremely flexible with hours here; the other companies in the area are not.<p>If salaries were transparent then the owners (there are outsiders besides the founders) would have to shell out quite a bit more money for what I consider below average developers. Transparency would appear to cause salaries to converge: raising them for below average developers and lowering them for above average developers. With the shortage of developers and talent in the area, we have to make by with what&#x27;s available (we are not in a position to entertain remote or telecommuting... other political/cultural issues due to the requirements of other department employees... &quot;if they can why can&#x27;t we X or Y?&quot;).<p>It isn&#x27;t always about money even though money is an important factor, more so for some than for others. Making a salaries transparent would make things crazy here. Especially if other departments saw the difference in pay. Lots of jealously would abound. Again, we don&#x27;t have the most understanding people here.",1387560517

Calling it instead &quot;Addable&quot; or &quot;Joinable&quot;, and explaining it instead as &quot;things with a default &#x27;zero&#x27; version, and which have a way to add two of them together&quot;, while perhaps not a perfect definition, would be much more intuitive for the majority of people.<p>That brings me to the second problem I see, which is that the esoteric terminology in Haskell creates a barrier between those who understand it, and those who don&#x27;t, and contribute to a sense of Haskell culture being exclusionary and cult-like, which discourages cross-talk.<p>Criticizing Hindley-Milner, on the other hand, I&#x27;m confused by.

Accept that you are unhappy right now but this is a temporary situation that you are willing to resolve. You have a job and presumably a place to live, so right now everything is okay.<p>To help with feeling overwhelmed, confused and anxious about your life I recommend a book called &quot;Focussing&quot; by Eugene Gendlin. Its hard to explain but he has exercises that allow you to cope with life&#x27;s problems by mentally building a little breathing space between your problems and your self. His method also allows you to get beyond the conscious self-talk and other mental static and tap the subconscious to understand why you are &quot;stuck&quot;. (It all sounds like a bunch of non-sense and even Gendlin oversells it but the book is cheap, the exercises are easy to do and helpful and you don&#x27;t have to buy into all the woo).<p>Based on your orginal post, it sounds like you launched on this life trajectory without thinking too much about it and that you are just now questioning it. This is a very common problem due to social expectations or parental pressures, etc.  So here you are. Many people go down this path but don&#x27;t question it until they hit middle age. So be glad you have avoided the disaster of a mid-life crisis. Moreover, figuring out who you are and what you value and what you want to do with your life at 22 is not only easier but you have way more options than the man who embarks on such a task at 50, with the ex-wife and three kids to consider.<p>So that is the essence of the problem. You are an adult now and need to decide what you believe, what you value and what you will do. In a more rational culture you would have been given much more guidance before being pushed out of the nest but the problem is still yours to solve.  I recommend two books to read by Ayn Rand; Philosophy Who Needs It and The Virtue of Selfishness. My recommendation is not so much about her philosophy but about learning to think philosophically about your life.",1387559899

I have used MongoDB a lot, however only having embedding to model relationships is also very limiting.<p>The promise of OrientDB is a documunt store with support for embedding (and class inheritance), but also being able to use references rather than joins.<p>What embedding and references have in common is that you have to do more up front work to define your relationships. You can think of it as freezing the possible queries available in a relational model to the subset that you actually use. I think this is a great default for most applications.<p>However, it is not what an analyst wants for doing ad-hoc queries, which SQL databases are great at. And even application creators often later decide that they want to do some ad-hoc analysis of data sitting in the database. This is where polyglot persistence should shine and you can have multiple databases that index the data in different ways.",1387559800

Or rather because of Vimscript: I thought that Lisp or whatever, even Forth would be better than Vimscript :)<p>After 3 or so years of using Vim heavily I started hit the limit of what can be done with defaults, simple options adjustions and even plugins. I honestly tried to use Vimscript, but I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do this for real. I knew some Scheme then, so I wasn&#x27;t afraid of Lisps. I switched and I immediately started implementing things I wished I had implemented months earlier in Vim. My Vim config was ~700 loc and it had only a few custom commands defined in it after 3 years. As I mentioned in another comment my emacs config is ~4k loc now and defines a multitude of advices, hooks and plain commands after half a year. It grows almost every day and what&#x27;s most important is that coding to Emacs APIs in ELisp gives me much more pleasure than coding in Vimscript.<p>Lastly, modality - somehow I&#x27;m not missing it. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;ve seen the light and now think that modal editors are an abomination, but I came to appreciate modeless-by-default model of editing. Emacs ofers many ways to enter modal mode, so when I felt that modal interface would be better for something I just coded it so it&#x27;s modal.<p>In short - if you&#x27;re a happy Vim user who doesn&#x27;t feel the need to write your own Vimscript (or you&#x27;re happy with Vimscript!) then I see no reason to switch (maybe org-mode or something, but that&#x27;s a very specific case). But if you thought at some point that you&#x27;d like to code up something in your editor but didn&#x27;t because it was too much of a PITA then give Emacs a try.",1387559377

It makes a bunch of extremely contentious claims and doesn&#x27;t answer any of the important questions.",1387558946
6942397,comment,6936672,6939492,1,0,cwp,,,"That&#x27;s why I think this is an east-vs-west thing. Orwell focuses pretty narrowly on the problem of Nazi aggression. They&#x27;re killing Jews and attacking other countries. So we go to war and 6 years later, the problem is solved. Except... decades later, Europe is still dealing with the after-effects of WWII. The current economic crisis can be traced pretty directly back to the war.<p>Ghandi and the Dalai Lama, on the other hand, have a much broader goal, which, yes, involves lifting oppression, but also includes more subtle aspects of the well-being of their followers <i>once that goal has been achieved.</i> I think that contra Orwell, practitioners of non-violence appeal not only to free societies elsewhere, but also to the humanity of their oppressors.  And so they try to eliminate the conflict, rather than winning it. Except... decades later, Tibet is still oppressed by China.<p>My point is not that Orwell is wrong, but that he misunderstands Ghandi.",1387558943

We&#x27;re putting too much emphasis on JS speed, when in reality most web apps are behind native because of lack of (perceived) graphics performance.<p>The shortcut out of this requires a greater variety of GPU-accelerated CSS transitions/DOM changes, as well as easier computations and DOM manipulations off the main thread, which cause horribly noticeable UI hiccups. Web Workers are still too primitive (e.g. no DOM access whatsoever) and slow (e.g. no shared memory).<p>Not saying it&#x27;s unimportant to improve JS&#x27;s CPU performance; just saying that we&#x27;re focusing too much on the wrong battle in the war against native.",1387558903

Consider in any ML language &quot;a b c d&quot; – we can see that &quot;a&quot; is a function, but we have no idea of its arity. Uncurried, it could be: &quot;a(b, c, d)&quot;, &quot;a(b, c)(d)&quot;, &quot;a(b)(c, d)&quot;, &quot;a(b)(c)(d)&quot; (oh, that&#x27;s the curried form again). Especially when function definitions are implied through pattern matching, it is hard to understand the contract of a function at a glance.<p>As a reader of that code cannot easily understand whether the number and type of arguments is correct, one has to rely on the type checker that everything will work out.<p>However, this is more of a criticism of ML syntax than of currying – all things are good in moderation.",1387558903

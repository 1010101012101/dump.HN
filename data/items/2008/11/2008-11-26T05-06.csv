377326,comment,376331,376376,0,0,paraschopra,,,"Actually, I have been thinking a lot on this idea. It is called adaptive web design. Cluttered web pages can be made a lot less cluttered by adaptively removing elements which are rarely used. Plus the system can also automatically test variations in designs, colours, etc depending on the user profile.<p>My idea was to make a javascript library which when included would automatically analyze the page structure and make the pages adaptive without much of an effort from the developer. The only thing here is that heavy javascript processing would be required to modify pages on the fly. Or, this can also be done on the backend but that would require templatizing existing websites (which could further slow down adoption of this technique).<p>Any thoughts?",1227679111

377324,comment,376238,377164,0,0,shawnyar217,,,"What you are missing is: 1) Analyzing a function's behavior sometimes (frequently) takes as long as running the function itself, 2) some functions can run forever, and 3) sometimes we can't tell the functions that run forever from those that run a very long time.<p>Example: Write a simple function F to generate prime numbers.  (Search the internet for examples if you've never tried it.  It can be done in a few lines with two loops.)  Your prime-number-generating function F will never halt, because it will never run out of integers to check -- i.e. because there are infinite integers to be tested for being prime.  So the halting problem is solvable for F, it is known that F will never halt.<p>Now slightly modify function F to notice whenever it has generated two primes in a row that are only two away from each other, such as 11 and 13.  Increment a counter C whenever these Twin Primes are detected.  This is as simple as storing the previous prime P1, subtracting it from the newly-generated prime P2, and seeing if P2-P1 is equal to 2.  Finally, make one last tiny change to your function: accept a parameter X, and halt when the counter C becomes greater than X.  At this point the function F is probably less than ten lines long and not very complicated at all.  I get to pick X for you.  Can you write an analyzer function A to decide if function F(X) halts or not?<p>The answer is: No, you can't.  To write function A you would have to prove or disprove the Twin Prime Conjecture, which mathematicians have been trying to do and failing at for centuries.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime_conjecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime_conjecture</a><p>Lets imagine that the Twin Prime Conjecture is wrong and there are a finite number of Twin Primes, N.  We've been searching for N for so long that I'm confident than N is very, very large, whatever it is.  Meaning I can pick an X that is less than N, but still so large that function F(X) will take longer than our lifetime to generate that many Twin Primes and halt.  Alternately, lets imagine that the Twin Prime Conjecture is correct and there are infinitely many Twin Primes.  Again, I can pick an X so large that it will take longer than our lifetime for F(X) to halt.  Either way, we would both be dead before knowing the results of the test, and maybe the test will never complete, who can say?<p>Worse, any analyzer function A you could write would have to know N to decide if F(X) will halt or not.  But N is not known and has not yet been discovered after hundreds of years of trying.  So function A would either have to disprove the Twin Primes Conjecture (unlikely with anything less than artificial intelligence) or it would have to calculate C by generating all the primes that F(X) would generate, meaning that A is equivalent to F, meaning that A is no faster than F.<p>Therefore, neither you nor any currently-conceivable function A can decide if function F(X) will halt or if F(X) will continue searching forever.  That's the halting problem and it's unsolvable for this F(X).",1227678905

Like a Woody Allen movie. It's funny but there is no point at which it's funny.<p>edit: So a few years ago I was attempting a startup with a cofounder who I really liked. Within about two months of starting his mom committed suicide, his high school gf died, and he came down with mono. True story. Is it funny? It's fucking hilarious. Why?

377310,comment,376883,376883,0,0,jhancock,,,"I just installed NetBeans 6.5 ""ruby edition"" after reading this post and just had to come back here to explain why Tim's thesis of ""we have many great complementing products to create a coherent whole"" (my words, not Tim's) is mostly an anchor around Sun's neck.<p>I download NetBeans 6.5 (ruby only version) and the installer tells me it needs to use 145 MB for the install.  I tell it ok and it asks for my root password and I give it and away it goes.  The install gleefully tells me at some point it is installing ""GlassFish v3 Prelude"".  WTF!!!  Stop doing things like this!!!<p>About a year or so ago, I seriously took into consideration adopting Solaris 10.  I read the basic install docs and tried to get a clean and basic install of Solaris.  No such luck.  I wanted a server OS and the default install gives me not 1 but 3 desktop solutions, multiple Sun products like a directory and mail server and yes, 3 versions of Java setup in a ""great"" multi-java install method.  This was done to enable the multiple other stuff to work as sun's various products it was jamming down my throat had different Java requirements.  
So what would I need to get a ""slimmed down Solaris install""?  I would need to read through a thousand pages of docs and write install scripts.  
So what did I do instead?  I switched to ubuntu server.  Why is ubuntu server great?  Because it does not have other products it is trying to ""up-sell"" me.<p>Sun thinks that because it is giving you some free tech that it spent lots of money creating that they have the user's permission to shove more stuff on the user.  This is a big problem.  If I want GlassFish, I'll install it.  If I want any form of X-windows or Java on my server, I'll ask for it.",1227677024

377306,comment,376820,377273,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""Do words exist somewhere, true, pure, fixed in meaning, waiting to be used""<p>I don't think so. But I think when we talk about, for example, <i>an</i> idea, there is some consensus that we are talking about a mental model of the way something works, the way something could work, or the way something has worked previously. (For sufficiently large definitions of something.) And if I asked you whether or not a fact was the same as an idea, you would agree that it was not. So our collective agreement on what the word means doesn't differ from the dictionary definition because it comes from some platonic ideal, but rather the definition in the dictionary is wrong because of a quirk in the way dictionaries are made.<p>""Objectively... funny? As in, if the entire human race disappeared and no other beings capable of abstract thought existed, certain things would have the qualities of funny?""<p>All humor comes from something being novel or broken relative to a set of existing mental models. When I say something can be objectively funny, what I mean is that something can be objectively novel or broken in relation to an existing mental model, whether or not anyone else realizes it.<p>So, can something be funny independently of humans?<p>Imagine if you will something being novel or broken relative to a mental model that no one actually holds. Is this funny? Clearly it can't be subjectively funny to anyone, because the humor is relative to a belief that no person holds. But can it be objectively funny, in sort of a mathematical sense?

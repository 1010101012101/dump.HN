Remember, Postgres’s code and algorithms need to be multithreaded because many clients could be searching or modifying the same index at the same time. By adding another pointer from each B-Tree node to the next sibling node — the so-called “right arrow” — one thread can search a tree even while a second thread is splitting a node without locking the entire index&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>The big innovation of Lehman and Yao was that their right link technique obviates the need for &quot;latch coupling&quot;, or in Postgres terms the crabbing of buffer locks. In other words, the Postgres implementation need only lock one page/buffer at a time as an index scan descends the B-Tree, rather than alternately locking a single page, then its child, then unlocking the parent, and once again locking the child (the grandchild of the original page). Certain other B-Tree implementations must do this until their descent reaches a leaf page, and locking multiple pages at once just to service index scans can hurt concurrency a lot (I think that they might need to be exclusive locks for writes, which is particularly poor).<p>These low-level locks are not to be confused with lock manager locks that have deadlock detection and so on. They&#x27;re low-level Readers–writer locks, and are far more lightweight (hence the Postgres term &quot;LWLock&quot;).<p>The basic idea of Lehman and Yao is that index scans of all types may detect and recover from a concurrent page split my following a right-link (having found that the page high key is logically less than the scankey value). It won&#x27;t matter that the parent page was observed to not have the new downlink that is inserted after a page split, except that we need to look right.",1435135706

9770388,comment,9769345,9769876,0,0,tzs,,,"> Notwithstanding the &quot;fat-free everything&quot; fad, the best epidermiological data we have so far suggest that fat consumption is highly correlated with coronary heart disease and all sorts of late-life complications. This could be wrong or out-dated, but FDA is only acting on the mainsteam scientific opinion that fat should be limited in a typical diet<p>Yet if we look at other peoples and cultures around the world we can find several with high fat diets without the coronary heart disease and other problems that seem to plague high fat consuming Americans. Some examples are the natives of many South Pacific islands, the Inuits, and the Maasai.<p>Components of a diet do not act in isolation. It really has to be looked at as a complete system. If reducing fat in the American diet reduces coronary heart disease, that does not mean fat is bad or fat is causing coronary heart disease. It could be that if some one component instead of fat were removed the same reduction in coronary heart disease might occur (carbohydrates might be a good candidate, since the traditional high fat Inuit diet was very low in them, and they have much lower coronary heart disease than mainstream Americans do).<p>For nearly every rule, supposedly backed by the then current science when the rule was published, it is usually possible to find some place where the traditional diet breaks that rule yet the people there are doing fine, not suffering from the afflictions we&#x27;ve been told will befall is if we violate the rule.<p>The tendency to look at things in isolation doesn&#x27;t just show up in unjustly declaring particular things bad. It also sometimes declares things good without sufficient justification. People look at, say, traditional Mediterranean diets and see that they have good outcomes, and figure it must be due to their heavy use of, say, olive oil. So then they start slathering olive oil over everything and expect they are going to get healthy no matter how crappy the stuff they are drowning in olive oil. In reality, there is probably no magic ingredient in the Mediterranean diets...it is the totality of their diet that is good.<p>What should be a simple task--regularly eating in a healthy way--is ridiculously complicated and requires way more research than it should in the US. And that&#x27;s without getting into processed foods, and how the goals of processed food providers don&#x27;t necessarily align with the goals of those trying to eat healthy.<p>I read somewhere (don&#x27;t remember where, so can&#x27;t give a good cite) that biochemists say we only understand about 10% of the chemical processes in our bodies. We know some things various nutrients are used for, but there are many we don&#x27;t know. We often don&#x27;t understand exactly how particular nutrients go from being part of our food to being being available at the places they are used in a form usable to our cells.<p>So it looks like the only reasonably effective way to eat healthy is to find some group of people whose traditional diet is known, and who have or had good outcomes in the health areas you are interested in, and had those good outcomes for a long time, and eat like you are one of them.<p>What I&#x27;ve not seen discussed is whether or not you can mix different diets this way. For instance, if you like the outcomes of traditional Mediterranean culture diets, and the outcome of traditional South Pacific Island diets, and so on for several cultures and their traditional diets, should you expect good outcomes if one day you eat like a South Pacific islander, and the next day like someone from a Mediterranean culture, and so on? Or do you need to stick with each culture&#x27;s diet for some kind of extended period?",1435135470

That&#x27;s not to impeach the source, only to encourage deep criticism about what the data is actually saying -- whether you agree with it or not. (In fact, I find that stories like this that I agree with I need to be <i>especially</i> careful of embedded spin because of the difficulty I have difficulty in seeing it.)<p>2) If we&#x27;re all going to have robots working for us in 100 years, the effective ratio between the bottom workers and the top ones will be infinity -- that is, the entire idea of a happier future is machines doing all the grunt work and people just doing creative things that they find value in. This data may be a sign we are on our way there -- I&#x27;d be careful about destroying our future before we get there.<p>3) The measure here is being made with &quot;comparably-paid workers&quot; So the inference is that you can compare specialty doctors and CEOs, or stock brokers and CEOs. No matter how you justify it, I don&#x27;t think such a comparison holds water. Are good stock brokers making 20x the money that bad stock brokers make? Perhaps. But does that mean that there would be a similar 20x range among CEOs? No, of course not.<p>4) I hate statistics-based social policy advocacy because there&#x27;s always this underlying idea of the old &quot;We take an aggregate number, make some broad generalizations about causality, then announce that the conclusion we had already reached before beginning our work is now evident.&quot; mentality. Carrots are poison? Sure, because 100% of the people who eat carrots are dead within 115 years. The only causal relationship I can come up with for CEO pay is the obvious one: highly-paid CEOs get that way because they manipulate the board into paying them that kind of money. This in itself is a skill. Creating large majorities of agreement among diverse stakeholders while maintaining a vision may also be a highly-paid skill among CEOS, and it may be related to their ability to manipulate boards, but even that is a bit of a stretch.<p>Beware facile arguments about complex topics.",1435134753

However, I don’t agree that the web has an inherent slowness. The articles for the new Facebook feature will be sent over exactly the same connection as web pages. However, the web versions of the articles have an extra layer of cruft attached to them, and that’s what makes the web slow to load. The speed problem is not inherent to the web; it’s a consequence of what passes for modern web development. Remove the cruft and we can compete again.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;ve been bitching about this ever since it became clear that CSS made web pages bulkier. (Yeah, it was supposed to make them shorter.  Didn&#x27;t happen.)   We had much faster loading pages when people created HTML 3.2 with Dreamweaver and tables, and <i>most of them looked about the same</i>.  Now we need HTTP2 so that all the &quot;assets&quot; can be loaded more effectively.  There are even content management systems which generate bloated custom CSS for every page, with huge numbers of classed tags customized for each page. This eliminates any useful caching.<p>Some major sites have figured this out. The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s home page has become shorter and simpler at the HTML level. Two years I looked at it, and some content management system was inserting the entire sign-up-for-a-subscription machinery on <i>every page</i>. They&#x27;ve fixed that.

Somebody should tell those guys about functions.<p>I have a web service which strips all active content (Javascript, Flash, Active-X, Silverlight, etc.) from a page, parses it, and redisplays it.

SW Update and Easy Settings are among the two worst pieces of software I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>If I press the volume keys on my (i7, Ivy Bridge) Samsung laptop, I often have to wait several minutes before anything happens.<p>Better yet, a clean Windows install on that machine will always fail because for some reason the laptop lets Windows install the bootloader to the mini cache SSD - which the BIOS doesn&#x27;t recognise.<p>I&#x27;m not going to be buying another Samsung PC.",1435133007

A certificate authorized to sign code was purchased from them. Samsung would directly, to prove that this shit software came from them.<p>Just like SSL/TLS. I could set up an SSL website that performs drive-by attacks, would Verisign sign that? Yes, yes they would.<p>Vericode isn&#x27;t an gate keeper like Macs certificates are. It&#x27;s designed to improve security: if I download a Samsung installer Windows will tell me that it is indeed from Samsung (during the UAC elevation) because the signature checks out. This means that I can be certain that unbeknownst malware won&#x27;t be installed on my PC alongside the Samsung malware.<p>The story is different with WHDL (drivers), those are signed by Microsoft (in addition to yourself, I think).",1435132920

Firstly &quot;culture fit&quot; sounds like a really great thing that companies would want. It has positive connotations, and its usage affirms that a) your company has a &quot;culture&quot; in the first place (a difficult problem for many orgs), and b) that you&#x27;re hiring people that are just right for maintaining that.<p>Secondly, &quot;culture&quot; itself indicates homogeneity. Here&#x27;s a fitting definition from Dictionary.app:<p>> the attitudes and behavior characteristics of a particular social group<p>&quot;<i>The</i> attitudes and behavior characteristics&quot; implies that there is one set of attitudes, one set of behaviors - which, unfortunately, is kind of the antithesis of &quot;diversity&quot;.<p>Another issue is that people who share these things that make up a culture tend to get along and collaborate more freely, on average, than those who don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s not to say that people with radically different cultures can&#x27;t work well together, but it&#x27;s far from the path of least resistance (which I&#x27;d argue is what businesses are after). The less time, and thus money, you have to spend on forcing your employees to collaborate, the better. This makes homogeneity very desirable in the eyes of management.<p>It may be worthwhile to define a &quot;company culture&quot; along latitudes less tied to artifacts from other forms of culture - however, that sounds like an incredibly difficult task, and I think you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find any company on Earth whose &quot;company culture&quot; doesn&#x27;t reflect values from regional or religious cultures. Even if you did, then you&#x27;d still be gestating your own flavor of homogeneity inside that organization, by hiring exclusively for people who can get behind those values.<p>I also think, personally, that &quot;diversity&quot; is only a goal worth pursuing when phrased as &quot;diversity in ideas&quot;, which, when reduced the useful subset therein, can be more succinctly stated as &quot;innovation&quot;[1] - and I think we&#x27;ve seen multiple times, innovation produced from very homogenous groups (or individuals, to whom it&#x27;s difficult to ascribe much diversity at the level of granularity to which most people refer).",1435132902

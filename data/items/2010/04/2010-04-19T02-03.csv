The SEC was already empowered to alter the requirements independently of legislation (since they were not set by legislation), but they've never done so.<p>The figures quoted are pulled out of their ass — they just took the old figures and adjusted for the last 30 years of inflation since they were set.

The sort of practical applications of rational functions involve very simple rational functions.  So if our motivation comes solely from word problems then the natural question is why are we learning to manipulate<p>( x^2 + 2xy + y^2)/(x - y) + 1/(x^2 - y^2)<p>Has there ever occurred a practical application in which this expression has come up?  If our motivation is expanding our understanding of manipulating algebraic objects then this expression is very much a practical application.  It's an extension of an existing idea - rational numbers - to a new class of objects.  Be able to do this sort of abstraction is useful in mathematics, and in fact is the essence of mathematical thought.  It's also useful in things like programming.",1271645691

But what people are missing is how powerful services like Heroku can be for devs. I have students that I mentor building projects with Heroku and Rails, and it's amazing to see what they can do. Yes, prices go up when you need to scale out, but getting an idea out in front of people and seeing if people will <i>use</i> the product is so important.

1275950,comment,1274911,1275876,0,0,aduric,,,"Ok, I'll bite.<p>It seems to me that Apple is following a trend they set in the early nineties. Since around 1986 to 1994, Apple introduced some of its most successful consumer products: Macintosh, PowerBook, System 7 (later to become OS X), etc. These products were wildly successful. They were richly-engineered, consumer-friendly, albeit expensive products.  They had their own software stack that was not transferable to other platforms, and that 3rd-party developers were not encouraged to deviate from.<p>Apple relied on very high profit margins that were not sustainable and instead of competing with companies that were making cheap commodity software that ran on any machine (such as Microsoft), they sued them.<p>All this set the stage for the rise of Microsoft and their licensing partnerships. Unlike Apple, Microsoft software such as Windows and Office ran on any machine. Developers could create software for these systems free of any restrictions. Even though it can be argued that Apple's software was better, it didn't matter. Developers were already heavily invested in developing for Microsoft's platform.<p>And now to make my point:<p>Where developers went, consumers soon followed. It became clear that more software was available on Windows, at a lower cost. Apple was soon on the decline. I am arguing that the same thing will happen again because I'm seeing the same narrative right now. You don't have to try too hard to find frustrated developers switching from Apple to another platform. It's become a hassle. And it will continue.<p>And again, where developers go, consumers follow.",1271645160

1275947,comment,1274911,1275117,0,0,macrael,,,"I think you are simplifying things a lot. I wasn't around back them to know the whole history myself, but my understanding is that there were a whole lot of factors that contributed to Windows taking over. A big part of it was Microsoft's ability to make many advantageous deals with the different hardware makers. Two big questions I have about how this is going to play out compared to the last time:<p>1. Is this really what the hardware makers want? They all have seen history as well, and if they go all in with Google the way that HP and Dell did with Microsoft, it leaves the them with precious little to differentiate themselves by. This is why the PC makers have all mostly ended up in a race to the lowest price with razor thin margins. Don't you think a company like HTC would rather be in Apple's position today with the Mac than in Dell's position with their PC's?
    * A partial answer to this question is that Palm did try, and seems to have failed (which is confusing to me because they seemed to be doing exciting things and had people who really liked their phones) so maybe the HTC's and Motorola's of the world think they have little choice in the matter<p>2. What does having a third major player in the room do to negotiations (OS + Hardware + Carrier)<p>One incident that ties these two questions together is how Motorola got screwed over the Droid. They invested a lot in making a decent smartphone running Android but since Verizon owns the name of the product, Motorola gets bumpkis from the product's success. People who bought a Droid may go out and buy a Droid 2 but they will be getting a phone from HTC not Motorola.<p>A post script question I have is how customers will react to the Dell-and-HP-ification of phones. With computers, there was never really an expectation of how fast and smoothly they could get things done. If Android phone makers end up in a price cutting war, they had better make sure the base model they are selling works <i>better</i> than some off the rack LG flip phone. People won't put up with phones that don't work, their experience is with phones that do.",1271644952

If it isn't successful, then it doesn't matter, since Google will be able to recruit them for far less money once the startup is dead.<p>It is in every company's best interest to pay the people they hire below market rate for their work. The only benefit Google gets from this is that they know the people they recruit through acquisitions are capable of building things. It's a trade-off: is it better to acquire a company, knowing the people aren't losers?

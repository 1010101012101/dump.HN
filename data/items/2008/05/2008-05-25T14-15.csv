There is just no reason to allow a stranger or zero privilege nobody/nogroup hack to write arbitrary data into your cache.<p>Step3: There is a race condition here that can corrupt your cache and cause sudden catastrophic performance problems.  When the cache expires, until someone manages to rewrite the cache all readers will try to regenerate it and rewrite it. If you used this technique because you had database load issues you are in for a thumping.  Worse, each will then write the cache, probably about the same time since they will be in lock step from the database IO, with an fopen/fwrite/fclose. You could end up with a muddle of a file.<p>To fix: you could use some sort of lock to ensure only one reader tries to rebuild the cache, but that scares some programmers. For writing the file you should ALWAYS write to a temporary, unique filename, close, then rename the file to the proper filename. It is a tiny nuisance, but rename is atomic in unix land and no one will get a partially written file or one muddled by multiple writers.<p>(For bonus performance, I'd add a random number to each ""too old"" check.  That way the first process that decides it was too old would start the rebuild of the cache, but most of its temporal peers would probably not think it was too old and would happily use the cache.  Otherwise you get a bunch of processes waiting for the rebuild.)<p>Step 4: If you are on Apache. It can make things more fragile by spreading your site across the filesystems, but I prefer to put files like this off in an area of filesystem not under docroot. The danger is that when someone goes to move the site, they have to know about these other files as well.<p>And finally: benchmark before and after. This can be a big performance win, but sometimes you can be surprised.",1211727286

(I'm skeptical of this claim but let's assume that it's true) If this type of advance is real then it could save a lot of lives. Unfortunately, if goog's engineering team has this kind of doubt about the machine, then I imagine that it would be easy to persuade a random jury that installing such a poorly understood black box is negligence.",1211727166

Anyone remember back that far?<p>Today's choice quote: <i>""Go ahead: Type in the keywords ""best knitting site"" into Google and tell me which site, out of the 300,000-plus results Google returns, is really the best knitting site. It cannot be done, despite the fact that there must be a best one.""</i><p>No, John, actually it's not at all clear that there ""must be a best one.""  There are probably lots of sites that are best for differing purposes and contexts and sets of values, and you're going to have to type something slightly more sophisticated that ""best knitting site"" into a search engine to find them.  If you walk into a library and ask for the best book on knitting, don't you think the librarian will ask some follow-up questions, to get a better feel for what you are looking for?",1211724335

407356,comment,407221,407221,0,0,stcredzero,,,"This seems to be more of the ""distraction culture"" of recent times.  Everything seems to want to let you know.  I'd rather be able to easily ask it to let me know.  The majority of time, I don't need to know more than I knew when I set processes in motion in the first place.<p>That said, I like Mark's approach.  But I'd like them to go one better in that direction.  Instead of just ephemeral, I'd rather that they not be there at all, unless I ask something to ""let me know when it happens.""",1230015017

After Turing we know that no matter what formal system of axioms and rules of inference one choses(as long as these can be mechanically done) then there will be some true statements the system wont be able to see.

After spending a bit of time working on a J2ME app, friends and I figured out that you'd have a helluva time getting it to run on enough phones to actually make a difference.  With operator restrictions, the need for security certs in order to run code on a real phone (important to gauge real behavior that emulators often can't do), and slightly differing implementations of J2ME on different devices, you'd have to do so much to get things to work to your liking.  If you're still insistent, experiment a bit and think of something to write. I figured out J2ME wasn't for me after a year of dealing with operators, devices, etc. HTH",1230013269

It is then assumed that the glass was once uniform, but has flowed to its new shape, which is a property of liquid. ... When actually installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames at the bottom of the window. Occasionally such glass has been found thinner side down or thicker on either side of the window's edge, as would be caused by carelessness at the time of installation.</i>",1230012095

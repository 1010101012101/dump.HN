I know that sounds like goofy sci-fi talk, but you can actually do this today with free software on Wi-Fi: run TCP-only Mumble over Tor to connect to your Mumble server, and periodically generate a new random MAC address (like Apple’s new phones do) and set up a new Tor circuit.<p>What’s left is how to pay for the Wi-Fi access anonymously, if people aren’t willing to share it with you for free.  If your wireless network access is all done through a centralized company, like a cellphone carrier, you could easily use one of the Chaumian centralized-issuer digital cash schemes from the 1990s: the “bank” is your cellphone company, and they sign a “blinded” form of a bunch of “coins”, which you later sign over to wireless base stations in exchange for bandwidth.  The protocol assures that the base station can confirm that the coin hasn’t been double-spent and that it’s properly signed by the bank, but the base station and bank together cannot figure out which coin it was.",1427155166

9254086,comment,9252671,9252671,0,0,themartorana,,,"Writing high performance server software is a whole other world from writing services. In the first, data copies can cause unacceptable slow-downs of a fraction of a millisecond - and those copies may be hidden all the way down at the driver level. When writing services (which are just as often written in Ruby or Python) trading off a few milliseconds for safety is often a worthy thing.<p>I spend most of my time writing services, and when looking at a language like Go, there&#x27;s a reason the default is pass-by-value. Passing around pointers to multiple co-routines is asking for a race condition, and in non-GC languages, null pointers. Services are rarely written with the precision of high-performance servers.<p>I don&#x27;t envy the server writers (although I can see how it would be fun!). Giving up a few milliseconds per request to make sure my co-routines aren&#x27;t sharing pointers is worthwhile, and I appreciate the safety that gives me. I&#x27;m sure someone will mention that Rust could give me the safety I was looking for in a non-GC language, but that&#x27;s the point, isn&#x27;t it - that by being able to game the system, you can gain a few precious microseconds here and there that enforced safety might cost you.",1427155056

You&#x27;d still have a string namespace, but that string namespace is more easily subdivided.<p>One key downside, though: for a conversation with any service not in your cache, you need to resolve the service before connecting, rather than knowing in advance.  So there&#x27;s still an advantage to any service that can use a well-known port.  That advantage partly goes away if you can resolve a hostname in the same DNS request as a service on that host, but that would require improving the current level of integration between clients and system resolvers.",1427155013

It cannot prevent MITM attacks because it allows unaffiliated third-parties to issue certificates on your website&#x27;s behalf (same as X.509), something that they have no business doing (and is completely unnecessary).<p>Nor does it guarantee that mis-issued certificates will be found. The reason is partly because, as you note, it is mostly a voluntary effort on behalf of the CAs out there, but also because its design is ineffective. Even if every CA participated in CT, it would still not accomplish much:<p>1. It does not prevent these types of attacks from being used on users.<p>2. It does not guarantee that mis-issued certificates would be found because it requires website owners to query all the logs out there in order to find out whether or not someone mis-issued a certificate (a sort of needle in a haystack problem that almost no one [except maybe large companies like Google] is going to engage in, and in the end doesn&#x27;t prevent attacks from happening).<p>Our detailed analysis of CT is here:<p><a href=""https://blog.okturtles.com/2014/09/the-trouble-with-certificate-transparency/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.okturtles.com/2014/09/the-trouble-with-certific...</a>",1427154953

Assigning port numbers to internet services globally across the entire internet was a mistake, and one that we can avoid for newly defined services.  It creates two problems:<p>1. The one mentioned in this article: the namespace is finite and small, leading to conflicts over the administration of its allocation;<p>2. virtual hosting — you can only have one instance of a service per IP address, unless you kludge into the higher-layer protocol (<i>every</i> higher-layer protocol) some way of telling the server which instance of the service you were <i>trying</i> to connect to.  And even then, all your “virtual hosts” have to be running on the same software — you can’t run some of them on Courier IMAP and others on Dovecot, say.  By contrast, if you just bind them to different ports and publish those port numbers in DNS SRV records, these problems go away.<p>TCPMUX on port 1 was the first attempt to solve this problem, but it didn&#x27;t catch on.

There is a reason that companies have an advantage on negotiation in general, that is because there are not many companies, but there are many potential employees. It is the burden of the potential employee to stand out and demonstrate his or her value in that situation. Why should you have a job instead of someone else? Why should you make more? Why should you make less?<p>In reality, they are good at getting floor-sweepers $32 an hour, while limiting other workers with ambition through seniority and contract prices for &quot;classes&quot; of people. They are good at getting employees to only do the minimum amount to fulfill their work obligation and be a slave to that corporation. After all, where else are you going to get those benefits and wages with no training or skills?<p>In my opinion, unions have destroyed industry in America and led to the wealth disparity that we now have to deal with, by encouraging industry to seek cheaper labor in other countries that do not have unions.<p>I already agree that unions helped American in the early part of last century, but have been an albatross since.<p>If unions only petitioned for labor laws to protect all employees, not just union employees, and if union used collective bargaining to set a base wage (with each person&#x27;s individual wages depended on his or her ability and work ethic), I would be all for them.",1427154041

The response was phenomenal. The teachers loved it, the principal talked about it every time he got a chance and the club was featured in several local news outlets as an example of the excellence and modernity of the local school system.<p>The language was C# using the (sadly now defunct) XNA game development framework, and it wasn&#x27;t long before I had 7th and 8th graders making games/winform/console apps of all sorts. We made a 2D side-scrolling space shooter and a tower defence game and the parents are still begging me to put it on again, which I sadly cannot due to a moving out of the area.<p>One thing I will say, and I spoke of this to all the kids, is the game development can be a very harsh environment. Often with substandard pay, long hours and tons of stress. Which I found out first hand as I went into the game dev industry right out of college and quickly decided it was not a fit for me (being that I enjoy having a life outside of my career). But game development as a hobby is an excellent way to build up programming chops, have a ton of fun, and even work your way into the game industry if you find it fits your life/career goals.<p>In regards to the article, the teacher seems likely to be acting under the mistaken assumption that anything that involves computer games was &quot;bad, mmmkay&quot;. I feel it is a safe statement to make the video games <i>can</i> have a positive affect on youth as I go interested in computers in general and programming specifically when I got into the Diablo 1 hacking/trainer scene so many years back.

You expect to be able to change the parameters of each of those stages and reason about the result.<p>You&#x27;ll generally see these pipelines depicted as editable, directed graphs (DAGs) in the application. Blender uses DAGs for a number of things - eg an image compositor, and for shading networks. It also provides modifier layers (like 3DS MAX) for geometry transformation.

Apple has it too, but I think because of scale android/google are head of the game in terms of the damage caused by fremium apps.<p>I think the best way for either company to fix it would be to not allow in-app purchases on free apps.  The reason I think it would fix it is that both app stores require you to have the app to vote on it, but with free apps it&#x27;s no big deal to download-vote-delete an app.  This opens you up to mechanical-turk type exploitation.<p>If it costs a buck to download, you&#x27;ve raised the cost of buying a vote, you&#x27;ve raised expectations of buyers. It has a side benefit of destroying the freemium market which in my opinion can only be a good thing.<p>My gut tells me that google could filter out sham reviews if they wanted to.

If we train a system to tell us what an image represents, the system will do its best to classify it in one of the existing categories. But having a low confidence in what an image represents it&#x27;s not the same as having high confidence in the fact that it doesn&#x27;t represent anything.

For what purpose?<p>Classes on elements exist for the purpose of styling via CSS, not for users to see or screen readers to read or googlebots to classify. So if you want your css classes to &quot;mean something&quot; (which is what &quot;being semantic&quot; is), you want them to mean something to the STYLE of your page! Hence, using class=&quot;two-thirds columns&quot; is perfectly semantic towards the purpose of visually styling the page.<p>Did you have some other interpretation of &quot;semantic&quot; that you think should apply instead? Perhaps you mean &quot;the structure of the content&quot;? That&#x27;s not what classes are for -- that&#x27;s what the elements themselves are for. Or perhaps you mean for visually-impaired folks to be able to easily navigate the content? That&#x27;s not what classes are for either -- that&#x27;s what ARIA roles are for. SEO perhaps? It&#x27;s possible that google uses class names for this, but that&#x27;s just black magic voodoo that us mere mortals can have no knowledge about (and even if we did, it could change tomorrow).<p>Here&#x27;s the thing about using tables for layout... the table element actually has a defined meaning in HTML... it is for tabular data.

CLOS also was a very different take on OO.<p>The core of Java is the OO programming model,  and ""good"" Java  programming revolves around what works in that model.<p>Lately I've become a fan of ""import static"",  which imports static functions from another class.  ""import static java.lang.Math.<i>"" is good to do if you need to do a lot of math,  for instance.  ""import static com.example.mysystem.MyDSL.</i>"" sets you up to use an internal DSL.<p>Faking Lambdas with objects is cumbersome but not difficult,  and remember there are many tricks like new ArrayMap<String,String>() {{ put(""k1"",""v1""); put (""k2"",""v2"")  }} which let you build structures the way you would in Javascript, Python, PHP, C# or whatever.",1313780305

2904434,comment,2902329,2902411,3,0,anamax,,,"> The tree design takes up less room than flat-panel arrays<p>The tree takes up less ""floor area"", but it takes up considerably more volume because it is significantly taller.  That's why, in most places, you probably don't want to replace large panels with a single tree, but with a forest of mini-trees.<p>Trees also have a ""concentration of weight"" problem, which can be an issue for roof-top installations.  The entire weight of the tree is on its trunk, which has a lot smaller cross-section than a comparable panel.  Roofs that can handle weight that is spread out often have problems with concentrated weight.  Again, the solution is a forest of mini-trees.<p>Note that the optimal spacing for solar-panel mini-trees is different from tree spacing in nature because nature's trees aren't just trying to optimize energy collection, they're also trying to crowd out their neighbors.",1313780259

It appears to be a common problem.<p>I also installed a number of patches from Preware, but nothing to my knowledge really addresses any of these concerns.<p>The ""laggy"" effects are software, not CPU. Even another 50% CPU isn't going to help a 3-second pause every time you send an SMS. It isn't going to prevent clearly software related bugs in the Mail app. It's also not going to make the buggy software decide to start triggering events on buttons it's clearly already registering (due to the droplet indicator on taps).<p>It's not going to make copy/paste as smooth as a double-tap, drag a point to highlight selection, tap ""Copy"" and done. Honestly I never did figure out the way to highlight the selection I wanted consistently. I'm pretty sure text-selections are not an OS-wide feature.<p>Even if in the past 30 days community patches came out to address all these issues (I seriously doubt it), who wants to depend on the grace of others for a product you just paid $250 for a couple months ago when the company that sold you the product is more interested in releasing and <i>patching/updating</i> a tablet?<p>Add to that no Pre3, the 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 fragmentation, and it was clear that without some major, <i>visible</i> effort on HP's part the Veer was already dead.<p>Plus the damn phone doesn't provide an option to keep the screen off on the Touchstone charger without a community patch.

2904419,comment,2902783,2903084,1,0,Jun8,,,"True. And not. Continuing with the sports analogy I think the comparison of sprinters and marathon runners is an apt one. It's been found (<a href=""http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/anatomyandphysiology/a/MuscleFiberType.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/anatomyandphysiology/a/Mu...</a>) that sprinters have a muscle metabolism that is much more anaerobic than normal <i>from birth</i> (you never exhale during a 100m dash), so good sprinters are pretty much born rather than made. On the other hand, although good genes do help (why are marathon winners generally from Africa?) you can train your muscles to have more efficient aerobic metabolism and be a top-notch marathoner.<p>So Gates is right in that top talent is probably born, there's <i>nothing</i> you can do to attain that level (which is true for most things, btw).

To a patent examiner, patents are the most convincing form of prior art--if only because she's used to reading them.<p>Second, it's widely thought to be risky to have your engineers read other people's patents, because then, if they later infringe those patents, the court is more likely to hold that it was willful infringement, and triple the damages.

Some are standard headers (Content-Type, Accept, etc...), others are not but widely used (X-Requested-With), and others you can make up on the spot. The web server will get those and can act on that to, for instance, customize what will be returned, or do cache work, or whatever.<p>If the XHR request returns a redirection, browsers will follow it automatically. That's what XHR does. Now most browsers will also re-use the headers you set (minus those for which it makes no sense maybe, not sure about that one actually but I'd expect things like ETag or Last-Modified could be re-set by the browser or stripped off).<p>Not Firefox. On the other side of the redirection, your new XHR request will not have <i>any</i> of the headers you set. No standard ones (like Accept) and no custom ones (X-Requested-With).

Any publicly traded company, even one that is not a software company, has tons of business processes that are specific to its way of doing business and its industry. That requires various specialized if not custom software and lots and lots of glue to put it all together. On top of that, businesses want to see into all that activity so all the data from that software needs to be extracted, collected, combined, and reported on properly which requires technical and business expertise specific to that company's business practices and technology choices. The addition of more cloud services increases this burden while decreasing other burdens.<p>HP makes lots of money through EDS selling consulting services and outsourcing services to do all that stuff. Stuff that is being fed by the move to more and more cloud services whether internal or external.<p>And when I say enterprise services, I mean software as a service stuff like Salesforce. There are more services that business need than Salesforce such as data warehousing that HP is in a strong position to enter or dominate. That said, even though something like Salesforce is a turn key solution hosted off site, it doesn't mean there isn't an enterprise sales process. A middle manager doesn't buy up 1,000 seats of Salesforce subscriptions at $65 per month without going through the normal enterprise approval process. I've seen it and it can take several months even though your average small business owner can sign up in 10 minutes with a corporate credit card. The real deal involves contract scrutiny and due diligence work. And just because Salesforce is easier, it doesn't mean you don't need a ton of development and integration work to bring it in line with your existing practices and software tools which usually requires outside experts at least for training if not complete outsourcing.",1313778715

It's hard to take such a design philosophy seriously without any supporting evidence to explain why the human brain doesn't find some simple concepts intuitive:<p>- Things are different at the edges\n- Objects with text underneath are taller than ones without\n- Temporary features (pop ups etc) at the forefront of attention are a different size to things in the background\n- Things inside a clear frame might follow different, contrasting proportions to those outside<p>I'm not a designer but I am a drummer. Rhythm-by-the-numbers is boring. Good rhythm plays around the edges, and within the same beat (say four to the bar) people enjoy different beats laid on top (say, three beats). You can speed up and slow down, emphasise boundaries by adding a little extra time to the last beat of the bar, etc. Is visual design any different?

The term ""disruptive technology"" was coined by Clayton Christensen, who has written several books on the topic. In <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i> he describes several disruptions in many industries in great detail.<p>The scenarios he describes (which the OP is referencing by using the term ""disruptive"") are not generic ""here's a company who won!"" situations. They are very specific. Namely, a competitor introduced a new technology that was inferior to established technologies in many important ways, but which was vastly superior in at least one. And importantly, it was superior in a way that could not be ""backported"" to the mainstream technology.<p>We talk about defensibility here sometimes, and each of these new technologies has a clear defensibility strategy.<p>Every Google Doc has a URL your coworker can click in an email, and be immediately editing the document, on any computer, whether or not they've paid for Office.

HP maybe had a chance to get into this market eventually, and WebOS was part of his strategy<p>It's not going to be the market it once was, but those companies have very, very good reasons to use enterprise software: they can't rely on no-name cloud providers for legal and ass-covering reasons, they need the local installations and control of their infrastructure, and their sales structure is optimized for dealing with large corporations.<p>> And why does no one want to try to compete with Apple?<p>Doing your own hardware is expensive, and getting good margins much more so. HP hasn't made high-quality hardware in ages, and they can't possibly compete with Apple or Google's partners in the arena when they have to catch up and invest even more money than them.",1313777050

Lots. Huge big piles of lots. People WANT disruption. Oh, sure, some companies come out with ""disruptive"" products, but those fade and die far more often than not. It's not just the product, it's the infrastructure, the ecosystem, the culture - all of which Apple identified, crafted, and nailed.<p>Yes, advice can indeed be ""be disruptive"", just as good advice includes ""do it right"" (which far too many don't and know it). The successful will grok what that _means_, and how extensive it is, and will build a long-term business model to achieve it ... which isn't ""hack together something simple and odd and sell a bunch and then sell the company to the first deep pocket who comes along.""",1313776942

I pretty much tried them all in my pursuit to find something I can drink without feeling tortured. In this quest I found that I was ok with cocktails (Long Island Ice Tea was my drink of choice for a while), but those you can only get when you're out at a bar. What about parties where the drinks come straight out of bottles from the grocery store? This is where I discovered Smirnoff Ice, which to me just doesn't have that gross alcohol taste. But of course because of that it's not generally considered a ""manly"" drink, so my peers always pressured me to drink ""non-girly"" drinks instead by making fun of me. After a while I just got sick of it and decided not to drink at all anymore, because it just wasn't worth the constant teasing.",1313776882

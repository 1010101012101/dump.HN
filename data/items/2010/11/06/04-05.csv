They are meant to reproduce the observable characteristics, like the peak potential, bursting behaviour, refractory period, things like that. They can reproduce the traces of biological neurons with good accuracy (like the link in the GP), and the papers describing the model mention ion channels and whatnot, but they're very abstract. They're not made to reproduce the biology.",1289019565

1876114,comment,1875718,1876073,0,0,callahad,,,"Just for corroboration, the term ""sexual assault"" is generally understood to include situations exactly like this one. My alma mater's policy on sexual misconduct has a reasonably nice definition: ""Sexual assault is intentional sexual contact with another person without that person’s consent. Consent exists when a person freely and knowingly agrees at the time to participate in a particular sexual act with a particular person. Consent is not effective, for example, when force, threat, or coercion is used. Consent is not effective when sexual contact is with a person who is unable to say no or otherwise resist because of the use of alcohol or drugs or because he or she is asleep or unconscious.""<p>The same policy defines sexual contact as including but not being limited to: ""sexual intercourse, penetration of an orifice (anal, oral or vaginal) with the penis, finger, or other object in a sexual manner, intentional touching of the genitals, buttocks, or breasts, or coercion to force someone else to touch one’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts. Sexual contact can occur over clothing.""<p>Most people in this thread will be viewing the term similarly to the definition above.<p>That said, I'll let other folks deal with the rest of your post; I won't be able to do so dispassionately.",1289019522

Its advantages of little or no vibration, low weight, minimum space requirements and low maintenance costs are considerable. In steam turbines high pressure steam is directed into a series of blades or vanes attached to a shaft, causing it to rotate. This rotary motion is transferred to the propeller shaft by gears. Steam is produced by boiling water in a boiler, which is fired by oil. Recent developments in steam turbines which have reduced fuel consumption and raised power output have made them more attractive as an alternative to diesel power in ships. They are 50 per cent lighter and on very large tankers some of the steam can be used to drive the large cargo oil pumps. Turbines are often used in container ships, which travel at high speeds.</i>",1289018919

I think the point I was making is that, at least in my case, I had a definition of ""assault"" long before I ever heard of the term ""sexual assault"" and I believe the latter is more of a legal term than a common sense, everyday term. Assault involves violence and planning. If there was no violence, and also possibly no planning/premeditation, I personally find it hard to swallow calling this ""assault"" of any kind. I mean, to put it in perspective, we're talking about, at <i>worst</i>, one adult male putting his hand inside the underwear of another adult female, at a bar, late at night, very likely while one or both parties are drunk, and one or both parties have been flirting or otherwise being touchy-feely with lots of folks all night preceding it. Add to this people who don't read body language and attraction cues perfectly well.

There is nearly zero barrier to filing a lawsuit; and a lawsuit, even one without merit, requires time, energy, and investment from the company to defend itself. That's why so many companies go out of their way to stay out of court and only fight those cases that are so clearly black and white they have little to no chance of losing.

The man wasn't 'asking to get mugged', and has the right to walk down through that neighbourhood and expect a level of safety. But still, the appropriate suggestion is to recommend a safer behaviour.<p>Applying the analogy to a woman's sexual assault scenario, you would have to look at the various pieces, and how they translate to our model. Was she dressing or behaving promiscuously? Is she going out and partying late at night? Yes, it is her right to dress and behave how she likes, and she <i>should</i> be able to do so safely, but this isn't the world we live in. These actions are the equivalent of walking through the unsafe neighbourhood alone at night in our above model.<p>The goal for society shouldn't be to regulate the woman's behaviour until she avoids all potential dangers. No, it should be to regulate the behaviour of the assaulter - by holding him accountable, and punishing him as necessary. Still, until society changes, it would be prudent for the women to make safer decisions.<p>This is no way is meant to apply directly to the OP's situation.

It is everyone else's job to avoid assaulting me.""<p>I think that statement is wrongheaded. Not the second part - it is indeed everyone else's job to avoid assaulting people. The responsibility for the crime lies entirely with the perpetrator.<p>Unfortunately, because of this, making any statement as to the victim's behavior is always seen as ""blaming the victim"".<p>The problem is, in this world, we only reliably control the actions of one person: ourselves. We can take principled stands that ""it's everyone else's job to not assault me"", and that's so true, but in the end, being right isn't a suitable stand-in for being safe.<p>That is why I don't like the statement, ""It is not my job to avoid getting assaulted"". Because regardless of where the responsibility should lie, in reality, we are ALWAYS the stewards of our own personal safety. We have to be, because we're the only person in the world who will treat the job with the gravity it deserves.<p>If I walk down a bad alley, it is not my fault if I get shot. The person pulling the trigger is 100% at fault. But, I was not being a good steward of my own safety.<p>Towards the end of the post, she says, ""I’m tired of people who think I should avoid having a beer in case my vigilance lapses for a moment."" You have a right to be tired. I've lived in a couple of unsafe places where I grew tired of the fact that I had to be vigilant just to go about my daily life. It is draining and it is frustrating to have to alter your behavior because of the threat posed by others. But we only have one life, and safety must take priority over principle.<p>It is right to say that the perpetrator is the one at fault. It is right to call them out and make them account for their actions. Innocent people shouldn't have to alter their behavior to avoid danger. But the reality is that they <i>have</i> <i>to</i> <i>anyway</i>.<p>EDIT: Allow me to clarify a couple of points. Some people are taking me as saying, ""you have to do everything possible to protect yourself, and if something happens, then you didn't protect yourself enough.""<p>This is false. Sometimes, stuff happens even if you do everything right. The point was simply that you have a responsibility to your own personal well-being to do everything right, even though you can't guarantee 100% safety.<p>Also, I have avoided applying my comments to her specific sequence of events. Some people have taken me as lecturing her in failing. Folks, she was largely <i>successful</i> in doing what I'm saying. Her attacker was clearly intending to do more and was foiled. This may not have been the case if, say, she had been too drunk, or in a place where she was not able to make the escape she did, etc.<p>What her attacker did was the sexual assault equivalent of a sucker punch. He found the ever-so-slightest opening and exploited it. She successfully shook off the initial attack and defended herself from any further assault. We're talking about a situation that <i>could</i> have ended much worse, and didn't because she was able to take ownership of her safety. And she had to do so because there was no one else to do the job.<p>Which is why I found the comments in her blog/tweet that I replied to a little puzzling, and made this post to address them.",1289017451

While none of us were there -- which is a big caveat -- from the description I read I'd hesitate to call what happened ""assault"". I'm picturing the assault on the Normandy defenses in 1944, in it's best usage. Or someone walking up to you and slamming a baseball bat into your face. Ouch. That's assault. But being kissed or having someone come on to you in a sexual/romantic manner -- even if you did not want it or reciprocate -- I think really stretches and abuses the language.<p>Here's one mental tool to help tease out the important distinction involved. Let's say the exact same thing happened as described in the story, except that the woman was sexually attracted to the man in question -- it would not be described as assault, just a man being aggressive and the woman liking it and being glad he did. It's pretty well known that a lot of woman like men to come on strong to them and be dominant -- of course the catch is they like this if they were attracted to them in the first place, but if they weren't, then it can have the opposite effect. Well, even if there were German soldiers stationed along the beaches of Normandy in 1944 who ""kinda wanted"" for the Allies to invade, it would regardless still be a military assault when they did.<p>Now add alcohol drinking, a bar, late night, partying, lots of rowdy behavior, touching, intentional flirting, geeks with poor social skills and body language cue reading, etc. and things become even more, shall we say, less clear cut.",1289017044

At this point I didn't know they where dating each other. One day he terminated the 'relationship' and the woman while seeking my advice made the comment that she could 'fuck up his life by saying he raped her'. I tried to convince her not to do so and though that she had desisted of such idea. A week later I was informed that my friend was being detained and charged with sexual assault, at that moment I actually put everything together, made a few calls and realized what had happened. I ended up telling everything she told to the police and my friend's lawyer and a week later the charges had been dropped.<p>I even had a closer to home to home experience with this in highschool, I was a girl's scape goat in a plot to make a boyfriend jealous while I was actually still a virgin.

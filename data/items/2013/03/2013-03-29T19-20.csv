Now they sell wedding cakes, some sheet cakes, and occasionally a pre-boxed slice if there are leftovers. These are your only options for snacking in the living room. You order a wedding cake, go pick it up in a few days, and hope it tastes good.<p>They are about to find out what happens when piping hot cookies are hand-delivered in 30 seconds or less to the living room, for free.<p>The only thing Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have going for them right now is that the iPhone and iPad are drawing away virtually all of Apple's not-inconsiderable attention.<p>Here's how it will work: Apple will release a $99 controller. It'll look like a SNES controller mated with an iPhone 3GS: 4"" standard-resolution multitouch screen, D-pad, four buttons, two shoulder buttons, and a Lightning port. (Inside is NOBODY CARES. gyro, bluetooth, Wifi, iOS SOC, battery.) And, naturally, it will be the least embarrassing looking item in your living room.<p>You'll take it out of the box, type in your Wifi password, log in to iCloud, and THAT IS IT.<p>The Apple TV (of which there are millions already installed) leaps into action. All the plumbing is silently set up, the App Store icon appears, a free showpiece game immediately offers to install itself, and Apple connects a half billion users to the television overnight.<p>Most of the Wii U's best controller ideas are co-opted, the overall controller complexity is a scant third of anyone else's, it retains all the power of touch controls, it requires no complicated setup whatsoever, all the game state is cloud-backed, dozens of touch-resistant game genres suddenly find a home in the lowest-walled garden of any shipping console, customers can add more controllers if desired, and the whole panoply of mobile software can infiltrate the last screen standing.<p>The Apple TV is a freaking trojan horse, if Apple wants it to be. Nobody else has the UX to stave them off, or the ability to hit the price points Apple can, or their sheer distribution power, or their sheer brand power, or anything.<p>Free cookies. Not nut-and-raisin filled wedding cakes. Which one is your kid going to reach for?""",1364587066

5462671,comment,5462087,5462618,3,0,marssaxman,,,"Assembly language is just a high level description of machine code: each assembler statement maps to one machine instruction. Those machine instructions are nothing but sequences of bytes. It is certainly possible to create executable code during runtime; you just write the appropriate bytes into a buffer, mark the buffer as executable, and jump in.<p>Back in the old days, before memory protection, we used to do all kinds of code-as-data-as-code tricks. I remember dynamically generating trampoline functions that effectively did partial application. I'd write a little stub of assembly code that would push a bunch of literal zeros onto a stack and then jump to zero; when I wanted to use it, I'd copy it, poke actual values into the literals, and then pass it along as a zero-parameters function pointer.<p>You don't change the language syntax; that doesn't really make sense in assembly world. It's more that assembly code lives in a world of bytes and pointers, and is itself very directly composed of bytes and pointers, and so it's as easy to use the same bytes-and-pointers concepts on code as it is on data.<p>This style still exists on microcontrollers, where there is generally no operating system. Instead, your compiler produces an image which you flash onto the controller chip. The controller has some startup sequence which jumps to some address in flash and runs. The chip's subsystems are controlled by registers located at specific addresses; in order to drive such a device you have to know how its address space is laid out, where your code is placed in it, and how your code interacts with the different types of memory and registers located in the address space.",1364586714

If it's never assigned from something that can be null, it can't be null. Of course, that requires global inference to determine the possible types that the RHS can be. dart2js does that with increasing sophistication.<p>> Maybe an external caller sends null to a method not expecting it.<p>dart2js is a whole program compiler so it can make closed world assumptions like this. At the point that it's compiling, there are no ""external"" callers. It can see every callsite in the entire program.<p>> Or, can you not call Dart compiled code from JS?<p>Yes, Dart does have a JS interop story[1]. We're still working on it, but, by design, it's not as seamless as say CoffeeScript. It's an actual <i>interop</i> process and not just ""it's all JS so it can all call each other"".

Counselors are a thing, and should help a student through the process and decide for themselves whether their placement is right for them. It should never be a ""this is what you're taking, period!"" If a student feels like school is too easy, they should be encouraged to make it known and be moved to something more appropriate for them. If it's too hard, the same applies. And if the parent does want to get involved, then it should be at the discretion of the counselor whether or not the student or parent's request should be met. This way we have a filter against parents who would otherwise impede their children for any given reason.<p>I don't think the honors/AP thing is silly. I think it's a system that tries very much to do (without too much success) what I am suggesting here. You have a swath of classes that are honors-level, and a swath that are AP-level above that, and then the normal classes. I wasn't AP-level in everything, nor was I honors-level in everything. It was a clear mix. But it's very much non-standard and very awkwardly done right now.<p>Now, no one is claiming there should be a stigma on a lower level at all. Just because someone is at AP-level (for lack of a better name at the moment) in a subject and would do well at a higher end university studying that subject doesn't mean someone who's not even at the honors level wouldn't also be able to go to the same school for the same subject a few years later when they're actually ready for it.<p>I feel awkward about the whole highschool -> college thing. It's just about continued education. College isn't necessarily ""higher"" education, as it could very much be an extension of high school for later bloomers. As a society, I believe we think about these things all wrong, and we put stigmas where there should be none.<p>But I do agree that there should be some way for students to be protected from indifferent, apathetic, or malicious parents.",1364585546

Questions like this pop up on Stack Overflow all the time (""Should I learn C?"") and there is a very solid consensus in professional software development circles: don't learn C unless you have to.<p>Are you writing performance-critical functions for a game? Are you writing an operating system? Are you debugging legacy code? Maybe you have to create a custom allocator for an embedded system. Sure, use C.<p>But the knowledge gained by learning C will almost never (ever) help you in ""real life"" development situations any more than learning assembly will (learning assembly is probably more useful, actually). If you're already familiar with C-style syntax (which like 90% of languages out there use), delving into C will teach you nothing about ""code organization"" like the author claims -- that's actually kind of laughable since C code is notoriously difficult to read.<p>Not only that, but several ""features"" mentioned in the blog are known caveats of the language: varargs are bad (<a href=""http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/stevehawley/archive/2006/03/16/9767.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atalasoft.com/cs/blogs/stevehawley/archive/2006/0...</a>), function pointers are difficult to work with and error prone, memory allocation is interesting to learn about in CS 101, but no real programmer wants to deal with it in most production code (that's why we have languages like C# and Java).<p>If you don't know C, you're not missing much. And unless you work in academia or very specific engineering fields, you don't need to know C. Want a challenge? Go rock climbing.<p>Edit: almost forgot about various C/C++ preprocessor nightmares (see double evaluation, etc): <a href=""http://www.nongnu.org/c-prog-book/online/x843.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nongnu.org/c-prog-book/online/x843.html</a>",1364585514

There's not ONE test that will tell you where to put someone. Instead, they should take multiple tests in different subjects to determine their aptitude in each, including the arts. Then a customized course plan can be made for the student.<p>This should only be considered for placement and re-placement every year or every few years. It shouldn't be the end-all. If a student feels they aren't challenged but would be better suited in more difficult classes, or feels their current ones are too difficult, they should be able to request a transfer. The same goes for the parents.<p>The problem with existing tests is that they try to optimize for the wrong thing. Standardized testing tends to try to set a bar for all students at a certain grade level (not at a certain educational level, as some people may well continue learning into their 20s, or may be done with ""high school"" level subjects at 15, it's different for every person). Because a lot of things are based on the pass/fail rates of these tests, they're constantly adjusted downward to reach a certain pass percentage, which is horrendous and doesn't actually say anything about any of the students that take them. They also result in people being taught specifically how to pass the tests without necessarily being permitted to learn what they want to learn. I'm also not a big fan of how ""top"" schools currently filter out people based on tests like these and how everyone's expected to be college ready at 18.",1364584902

Put together a proposal of what I should have done.<p>Include in it a location: It must be on or near an accredited university. Find housing that is magically ""super cheap"" or not a ""luxury"". Specify the costs. The housing must allow for no deposit (don't have the money) and nonexistent credit and allow for a married couple to stay there - dorms obviously won't work. Scans of local newspaper clippings from around the country will suffice since Apartments.com didn't exist back then.<p>A money ($) budget: Include all relevant transport costs, food, clothes, tuition, etc. Every single thing that costs money. These have to be real costs and not a WAG. If you pick a school, include tuition for two and all relevant fees exactly.<p>A time budget: Map out what my day-to-day life should have been according to your omniscience. Include every minute from wake-up to sleep. Include all travel times to and from work, home and school (I'll allow shopping time to be ignored). This probably implies that work, home and school are within walking distance, large isolated land grant universities won't work since available jobs centers are obviously too far.<p>A job or two: They must pay in isolation or in combination enough to cover the budget above, while allowing time to go to school, and they must be able to be done at different times. No time travel! Remember no college degree or other relevant qualifications. Jobs must be both available and plentiful. Just putting out ""work at Costco"" won't cut it, one <i>actually</i> has to get hired. I can tell you that my hit rate on job applications was less than 10% (I received 1 job based on over 100 applications).<p>Add in a $10,000 medical bill due in 45 days.<p>Describe a way to relocate two cars and an apartment full of stuff at zero cost to this magical valley of freedom (as in beer) and plenty.",1364584753

This means in some cases that instead of reading one function to understand what's going on, you have to jump through several files to understand the whole thing...<p>My personal rule of thumb is that if some pattern repeats 3 times or more, I would consider it boilerplate, and refactor it into a separate library/function.

Faunus is an OLAP graph-analytics engine that integrates Titan with Hadoop for global analysis of Titan graphs. Graphs are analyzed using a MapReduce implementation of the Gremlin graph traversal language. General use-cases include computing graph derivations/transformations and global graph statistics. You can then feed the global-algo results back into Titan.<p>3. Fulgora is an in-memory, compression-based, transaction-less OLAP graph processor capable of storing billions of edges within the memory confines of a single machine. Fulgora is optimized for the execution of massively threaded, global graph algorithms. It will come out later this year, and you can connect it to Faunus or feed it directly from Titan.<p>If you can construct a local SybilGuard algo, you can run it  in Titan and get an immediate response. Otherwise, for global-graph algos, you would feed Faunus from Titan directly and query Faunus' in-memory graph. There are also things in the works that will blur these distinctions. More details to come later this month in a series of blog posts -- stay tuned.<p>Marko or Matthias will have more insight on how to best run a SybilGuard-type algo.

This basically outlines how much force they should be using in any situation. Without deviating from the topic, this is where the public gets upset when an officer oversteps their bounds to use excessive force on someone. The first 'level' of all continuum protocols is simply 'presence'. Knowing a cop is around does stop a majority of people who would do illegal activity. Think about how you act next time a cop is behind you on the road. It's a passive power-play move; they need to keep up this presence to ensure the public knows they'll be a moment's notice away if something happens.<p>Moving cops to social media sounds perfectly logical to me. A lot of none-the-wiser people put this information on the internet, thinking its safe.

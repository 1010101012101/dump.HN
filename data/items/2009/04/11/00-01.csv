Originally I proposed a straightforward algorithm for deciding: to use Erdos numbers with Ron Conway as the seed. I took this out because I thought it was better not to go into this level of detail in the essay, but I'd advocate using something like this to decide who was a startup investor.",1239411502

557024,comment,556756,556987,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"Thanks.  The word ""fail"" is actually an allusion to the parking meter story, which used it to great effect.<p>I am a huge Reddit/Digg fan (though the new Digg bar is indefensible.)  I think what those two sites have done is unleashed a generation of writers and publishers, confident that they now have a tool to find an audience when they make something really great.<p>But for those writers who want to dig into local issues, there is no tool like that.  When I came to Chicago for j-school and was pumping out stories every day, I had no way to put them in front of people.  And my stuff died a quick death on Digg because it just didn't belong.<p>That's not a bad thing, it's just how it is.  So I've spent the last year creating a solution in Chicago.  This post was written to celebrate a bit of a milestone and also to point out to local publishers that they should stop chasing the fools gold of Digg's front page and come join up with us.  :)",1239410265

We'll establish our own accreditation procedure. </i><p>This part scares me.  Accreditation boards are a bug, not a feature.  Perhaps, like pg's idea, they started out as well intentioned.  But today, their primary purpose is to erect arbitrary barriers of entries, thus propping of the salaries of professionals and the tuition of the schools.  The tech industry is great because it is so isolated from politics and bureaucracy.  I'd hate for that to change.",1239410154

557020,comment,556908,556908,0,0,mohamedsa,,,"As a non-American who applied to YC twice the article was a pleasant surprise. However I'm not sure America is as attractive to non-American founders as some people think. I'll explain (my arguments are mostly personal perceptions...I have no practical evidence yet on any of this since my own startup is still at the ""wrote some code"" stage).<p>Let's suppose there are 2 types of founders: people who have enough money & connections, and the young ""live on Ramen noodles"" type founders.<p>For the ""money & connections"" type, a lot of foreign countries offer cheap but still qualified programmers and don't put too many obstacles on founding companies so if your country is like that it might make sense to stay. For the ""Ramen"" type, many of them may not afford America's often high living costs.<p>As for the argument that the US provides a better/more free market... even this is changing: The internet probably allows relatively easy selling to worldwide customers from any country.<p>All that said, the American dream probably still lives on and many people would likely provide counter-examples to my limited point of view. Of course pg didn't claim that coming to the US is a no-brainer for every single talented hacker. There are probably enough of those who are interested to satisfy the 10,000 founder/year goal.",1239409668

There are a lot more older women than older men.<p>That said, I don't see why the definition of ""single"" makes a difference to you, unless your concern was that we're going to have a catastrophic shortage of women in 50 years.  Women may simply marry earlier in life, but you're still just as screwed if you're a young guy (Or not, as the case may be.)",1239409579

I was typing about 12 words a minute after tying it for a short while. Kinda torn about the predictive nature of it, though. On the one hand, it lets you type faster in the beginning, but on the other hand it makes it harder for you to really speed up, as it is akin to having the 'g' button go huge on your keyboard right after typing the letters 'havin' but still. I was typing at 5 wpm when I first got onto a computer (I was 4) and now I type at around 40 to 60, after thousands of hours of experience.<p>If you are going to give it a try, definitely ramp up the speed or you are going to judge it on false pretenses.",1239409372

6662337,comment,6661019,6661706,22,0,jdunck,,,"(django core feedback):<p>Django is not perfect, and will never be. It&#x27;s now a fairly large codebase, and though there are a bunch of committers, people often feel it&#x27;s easier to write their own library than push things into core.<p>Separate from that, some things really don&#x27;t belong in core - they aren&#x27;t generally applicable, even if they are valid use cases.  We prefer to address minority use cases with extensibility.  Rather than saying &quot;your use case is not valid&quot;, or saying &quot;give us your kitchen sink&quot;, we say: &quot;OK, that&#x27;s a nice sink - why can&#x27;t you currently use it? What if we add this valve here?&quot;<p>In the best (and, I think, fairly common) case, people write libraries, the community finds it generally useful, and the best of that library gets incorporated.  We&#x27;ve gained authentication, cache, and migration improvements that way.<p>There <i>are</i> warts, but the proliferation of libraries are not bloat - they are often a resistance to bloat. Search github for django + jsonfield, and you will see quite a lot of opinions about what it should be.  If we&#x27;d added the first one that seemed decent, we would have been adding a wart for many people.<p>I have used all of the recommended libraries before, and while they are nice, I wouldn&#x27;t call them essential.  It works fine without them.  Some of the -extensions are very nice, but they rely on 3rd-party libraries, and django has had a pretty conservative dependency policy - python, your database driver, and you&#x27;re generally ready to go.  I think that&#x27;s a win -- you can add additional dependencies if you want them.  Of the libraries, only South is a thing I have used on most projects, and as noted elsewhere in the thread, that&#x27;s being incorporated into core.  As for grappelli - I think the admin needs an update, and we&#x27;ve worked off and on on that quite a bit. Grappelli imagines one direction for improvement, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s what core should be -- and I suspect the Grappelli maintainers would agree.<p>With all that said -- I consider flask roughly comparable to sinatra -- it is smaller, but what parts there are make additional, not fewer assumptions about what you&#x27;re building.  SQLA is a way more powerful ORM than Django&#x27;s, but I don&#x27;t often feel limited by Django&#x27;s. And when I do, there&#x27;s .raw or .execute.  I find SQLA to be overkill for the sorts of queries you&#x27;d do in a web request.<p>If you&#x27;re saying: you&#x27;d rather learn best-of-breed libraries and compose them yourself -- that&#x27;s a valid point of view, but it&#x27;s an opinion, not a correct answer for all sites or situations.  Since reuse-in-the-large is still an unsolved problem, a thing that falls out of using different libraries and composing yourself is that you lose the community&#x27;s bounty of components that work with your particular system composition.  As for me: I recognize that django is larger and harder to pick up than flask, but I suspect that if you instead (and, IMHO, more properly) compared picking up django with picking up flask, SQLA, jinja, flask-admin, etc -- then they compare favorably in terms of uptake -- and django still gains from the community&#x27;s many django-* libraries.",1383456578

6662334,comment,6661282,6662273,3,0,halostatue,,,"Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t be hard pressed to say that. If I had said that it was <i>exclusively</i> the result of government, then I&#x27;d be saying something even more nonsensical than what&#x27;s been said by the folks who actually think that government dysfunction is a path to success.<p>1. The increased government spending on infrastructure and social structure reduces private spending on infrastructure and social structure, freeing up that capital to be spent on other projects, or even enabling projects that could not be considered previously.<p>While we are facing a number of problems related to deep dependency on petroleum now, the Eisenhower Interstate Highway system <i>revolutionized</i> cargo transit. In general, greater spending on the highway system from the federal level required that states and municipalities spend more keeping their connecting roads up to dateto the point of paving more roads that had previously not been paved, increasing commercial access to everyone in general.<p>I&#x27;ve made the point some time ago, but increased social spending allows businesses to exist that would not otherwise exist precisely because of that social spending. In economically depressed areas, there will be people employed because recipients of social spending have funds that they would not otherwise have available.<p>While it is true that at times government gets in the way of progress, it is <i>not</i> generally because of an activist government looking out for the welfare of all of its citizens, but rather because of a conservative (meaning trying to preserve the status quo, not a political stance per se) government protecting the interests of an elite class. Both sorts of government can exist at the same time in a single administration.<p>2. The federal government has been the greatest force operating <i>in favour of</i> civil rights for about 150 years, although with a spotty record. The most recent failures exist primarily because of recidivist views about the nature of civil rights, primarily embodied in the views of the Roberts court and current (20102013) Tea Party Republicans. State governments, on the other hand, have by and large been powerful forces acting against civil rights that have been forced to act differently because of federal government intervention. Any argument otherwise had best be backed fairly heavily by reputable evidence, because that&#x27;s the history.<p>3. I would appreciate that you not argue against a straw-man. I never said that the past was always civil. I said that the divisions that have existed in the past have never lasted this long and been this deep; they have (once) been deeper to the point of war, but most of those divisions have (i) been fairly short, limited to one or two sessions of congress, and (ii) not impeded the rest of the operation of government in any meaningful way. Even McCarthyism didn&#x27;t break government the way that recent events have. Bills were still passed, and the business of government moved forward at a better pace than you would imagine.<p>4. Check your history again. IIRC, the monetary crises of the 1890s and the 1920s1930s were caused in no small part by improvements to productivity (rapid industrialization, etc.) and technology (trains, cars, etc.) and low interest rates, as well as extremely loose regulatory environments. Both can be fixed by taking taxation seriously and not pretending that it is an evil thing, as far too many modern politicians and internet libertarians do.",1383456513

It allows you to mess with the tuning in a wide range of different ways and test out what a number of exotic tuning systems actually sound like. 5-tone equal temperament and 7-tone equal temperament sound surprisingly good for such a coarse division of the octave, and if I understand correctly these systems are actually used in some cultures.<p>Aside from those two, it&#x27;s very much worth experimenting with quarter-comma meantone -- the tuning system that preceded equal temperament in the west. The purity of the major thirds is striking, and the distinction between diatonic and chromatic semitones (and therefore between e.g. C sharp and D flat) adds a sort of sophistication that I find useful in some ways -- especially since the tonal relationships in Western music map onto these distinctions more or less perfectly. However, it took a few days for this tuning to stop sounding slightly &quot;wrong&quot; to my ears; it was a little unsettling to feel how wrong it sounded while knowing that it was actually more &quot;right&quot; than what I was used to.<p>Playing around with this software it&#x27;s become abundantly clear to me that yes, it is just a cultural thing.<p>You can get 2032 from here:\n<a href=""http://www.dynamictonality.com/2032.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dynamictonality.com/2032.htm</a>",1383456321

Your original point suggested that continuous dysfunction is the reason that the U.S. is successful. Not only is this nonsensical, it is ahistorical. Yes, the U.S. has had periods of hyper-partisanship prior to the last fifteen years. The most serious of these resulted in a war. However, over most of the last 224 years, the U.S. has had more periods of cooperation and compromise than hyper-partisanship and dysfunction. Even during the 1930s (where there a plot to stage a coup d&#x27;tat, defeated only because the plotters misjudged their preferred candidate) and the 1950s (e.g., McCarthy) the business of government moved forward and there were measurable improvements in the quality of life and infrastructure directly attributable to government intervention. (See also the TVA.)<p>b. Your assessment is flat-out incorrect on numerous levels. Again, it assumes facts that are not only not in evidence, but contrary to the facts that actually exist. This is a common problem with choosing to believe ideological stances rather than comparing them against facts.<p>Under no circumstances do I think that all government programs are successful; however, the U.S. saw greater <i>real</i> economic growth during times of higher government spending on infrastructure programs and social programs (as I indicated) than it has when these things fall to the best interests of the monied classes and so-called Christian charity.<p>I dont know what your particular political stance is, but your characterization of the charitable nature of Europeans is misguided, at besta lot of the higher charitable donation rates in the U.S. are because (1) the government funds <i>arent</i> there to assist those in need, (2) there are greater tax incentives to donate more. I put charitable in quotes because all donations to churchesfor any reason whatsoeverare considered tax deductible in the U.S. Most of those donations are <i>not</i> used for local charitable assistance (e.g., soup kitchens, etc.) activities; they are used for church building maintenance, salaries, mission work, etc.<p>I <i>suspect</i> (because I dont know where to find the actual numbers for this) that if you were to measure per-capita charitable assistance spending through charitable donations, it would be similar. I also don&#x27;t happen to think that the success of a nation should be measured on how financially charitable its people are to those less fortunate members of societyI think it should be measured on how few of its people have what is now termed food insecurity.

Indeed, its widespread introduction was very controversial because it was always considered a compromise on the purity of the sound. Never the less, its incredible convenience prevailed.<p>When we talk about &quot;pure&quot; sounds. The sound intervals that sound best to the human ear form simple numeric frequency ratios. However, if you tune a scale in a way that is closer to this ideal, not every semi-tone is interchangeable and playing pieces in certain keys sounds down right horrible.<p>That&#x27;s why, choosing the key of a piece, once actually had a relatively larger impact on how it would sound, depending on how the instrument was tuned. Dissonance in some keys was even sometimes exploited by certain composers. Unfortunately we lose the impact of how these pieces would have sounded when played on modern instruments.

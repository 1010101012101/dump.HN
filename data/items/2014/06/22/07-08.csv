They shouldn&#x27;t have any INTEREST in doing that - it isn&#x27;t important to their main function of delivering mail.</i><p>It&#x27;s certainly of fundamental importance to any kind of registered mail. And outside of registered mail, tracking mail helps internal processes - ensuring that mail isn&#x27;t lost or forgotten. Tracking mail can help identify mail theives and other issues affecting timely delivery.<p>The problem comes when they share that information with outside agencies, or use it for reasons other than improving the timely and accurate delivery of mail",1403423974

Happy to do it, because I found someone who worked very fast!<p>Don&#x27;t forget that the client might not know what the budget should be, and on most sites, you can simply bid above their max and explain in the proposal why their budget was too low. Likely you will stand out if you brought up something they forgot to include or didn&#x27;t consider.<p>Question: what if they said there will be an audition project at your specified rate?

7927191,comment,7927099,7927099,2,0,vitovito,,,"The simple answer is, it&#x27;s in the contract.  Your contract with your developer, which you both negotiate and sign, says that you pay for them to develop your app, and perhaps would have a non-compete clause to prevent them from self-publishing a similar app within, say, a year.<p>If they violate the terms of the contract, your lawyer sues them.<p>Now, this is tricky in general, because app store submission processes are developer-oriented, and there will inevitably be bugs, which your developer will have to fix.  There are a lot of details to hammer out on how to arrange all of that.  But it&#x27;s not a trust issue, it&#x27;s just a paperwork one, as long as you can afford to enforce it.<p>Now, if you <i>can&#x27;t</i> afford to enforce it, then you do need trust.  And one way to have that trust is to have respect.  A developer will respect you more if you bring something tangible to the table.  That is, more than just an idea.  This is the long answer.<p>If all you have is an idea, then a developer (or designer, for that matter) is going to have to figure out a lot on their own.  They&#x27;re going to have to figure out what you mean, who the users are going to be, what the users want, how the marketing will promote the app, what it should cost, how many users at one time the app will have to handle, on and on, every detail.  There will be so many details that you haven&#x27;t thought of yet, that the developer will have to figure out, that it will basically be the developer&#x27;s app.<p>Any developer (or designer) worth their salt is going to ask for at least 51% equity in your company to build your idea, because they will basically be doing all the work.<p>The only way to retain control, and to earn enough respect to deserve it, is to do all of that work up front, yourself.<p>That&#x27;s the role of the businessperson in a startup.  You do all the market research to figure out that people will definitely buy this kind app.  You do all customer development to figure out what problem this app will solve for them.  You do all the user research to figure out exactly how the app will solve that problem.  You do the competitive analysis to figure out the price and positioning of your app relative to other solutions in the market.  You do all the sales channel development to figure out how to tell people about the app.  You do all the projections to figure out how much money you might make.  And then you put that all in a Powerpoint to convince a developer that &quot;all&quot; they need to do is build it, they can focus on code and not have to worry about all that business stuff, you&#x27;ve got it covered.<p>That&#x27;s your job.  An idea isn&#x27;t good enough.  There&#x27;s a lot more than just programming that goes into an app, and you have to have covered everything else if all you want is a programmer to build you something.<p>Good luck!",1403423173
7927190,comment,7926550,7927061,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"Well, no, that phrase does not actually inherently have that meaning, but rather it&#x27;s one possible use of that phrase, another valid interpretation would be the plain english one. Given that AFAICS noone was proclaiming an expectation of privacy in that specific sense, your use in that sense was rather unmotivated, which is why I went with the alternative interpretation.<p>Now, if I had known that you were using the phrase in that specific sense, I&#x27;d simply have asked: Where did you get the idea that anyone has an expectation of privacy (in the legal sense), and what does that have to do with the topic at hand (which is people&#x27;s expectation of privacy (in the non-legal sense))?<p>I think you are completely confusing &quot;what the law (possibly) is&quot; with &quot;what the law should be&quot;. This discussion is about what the law should be, but all you seem to be writing is &quot;but the law is this!&quot;. This whole discussion exists because the law as it stands is defective, and people are aware of it (or maybe the law is actually fine, but then it at least tends to be mis-interpreted), so your pointing out what the law is is kinda besides the point. My actual expectation is that the postal service does not archive letter meta data and I have good reasons for that expectation. If the current law doesn&#x27;t mirror that expectation, then the law needs to be changed.<p>Now, if you think the law is fine as it is and as it is applied, you maybe should bring forward some argument for why the law is good as it is and why a change would be bad rather than just state what the current law is.<p>Also, one more point: I would guess that society in general would actually not expect their letter meta data to be archived, and just as it is convention to not open a sealed envelope (a very strong convention indeed, given that it is law, but still it&#x27;s just a convention in the sense that there is nothing inherent in an envelope that makes the content private - it doesn&#x27;t really hinder access to the content at all, it&#x27;s just that for good reasons society at some point has decided &quot;a sealed envelope is not to be looked inside even though it&#x27;s trivial to do so&quot; when it just as well might have decided instead for a convention of &quot;every sealed envelope is to be opened by the postal service and the content copied and archived&quot;), it should for similar reasons be convention to not archive letter meta data even though that also is trivial to do, and if that is the convention, then all you have to do to &quot;demonstrate that you expect privacy&quot; is to post a letter that is not explicitly labeled &quot;please archive!&quot;, just as you &quot;demonstrate that you don&#x27;t want to be shot&quot; by going outside without a sign saying &quot;please shoot me&quot;.",1403423118

Now strip clubs on the other hand are required by law to be tucked away in isolated locations.

Single family homes in the outer boroughs will have almost no yellow cab coverage for pickup and finding a cab that will take you out of Manhattan can be dicey, although I guess those lime green cabs are meant to address that.

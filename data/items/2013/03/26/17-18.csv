That's crazy! Not overcooking is one of the keys to pretty much anything you want to cook, actually. Also, use an oven bag, which traps all the moisture in the bag. Comes out great when I make it that way, no need for basting or anything. Learned about not overcooking from Mark Bittman:<p>> At least one reader has expressed concern that a turkey will not be done if its internal temperature is less than 165, as the U.S.D.A. recommends. The recipe calls for temperature of 155 because salmonella is killed at 140 (as long as its held there for 12 minutes). Further, if turkey is cooked to 155, its temperature will rise to 165 or higher while resting. A temperature of 165 isnt unreasonable, but the turkeys temperature will rise to 175 or 180 before serving, and thats overcooked. If youre more comfortable cooking to higher temperatures, feel free, but expect drier meat.

I mean if she's going to sit around and personally review every single person that comes to apply at Yahoo then, yeah, she better restrict the number of recruits reaching her.

5444934,comment,5441757,5444152,6,0,pron,,,"1. Maybe, depending how you define ""systems programming language"". Go, unlike Rust, is not really low level. Its just as ""systems level"" as Java is, and many C++ shops have switched to Java. So Go is like Java in that respect. Not a C/C++ replacement in the post-Java era.<p>2. Sure. Much faster than C++. But, as Go is really a Java alternative rather than a C++ alternative, the compiler is not that much faster than Java's.<p>3. Yes, but not fast enough as a C/C++ replacement. It's not even as fast as Java.<p>4. The Go team has made some interesting, and risky, design decisions with the GC. They write: ""Go must support what we call interior pointers to objects allocated in the heap...  This design point affects which collection algorithms can be used, and may make them more difficult, but after careful thought we decided that it was necessary to allow interior pointers because of the benefits to the programmer and the ability to reduce pressure on the (perhaps harder to implement) collector. So far, our experience comparing similar Go and Java programs shows that use of interior pointers can have a significant effect on total arena size, latency, and collection times."" It will be interesting to see how this decision pans out.<p>5. I think he pretty much just did. Or, to be precise, he quoted what is likely a false prediction.<p>It is true that both Go and Rust were first touted as a C/C++ replacement. Go clearly isn't while Rust clearly is. Go is a Java alternative minus the dynamic code-loading, and as such, hardly revolutionary. You get similar compilation speed, a slower runtime and none of the dynamic stuff. Go is sure a nice language, but Java shops are better off moving on to Clojure or Scala if they need a better language.",1364320416

The best schools are cheap (a few select ones even offer a modest salary to their students). The worse ones, ""universits"", are cheap as well. Expensive schools are in the middle, for kids of wealthy parents who do OK at school, but aren't good enough to pass the best schools' very selective entry competitions.<p>Of course, these institutions being run by academics and civil servants, they aren't exactly reactive nor modernist; I've recently read a prominent school official explaining that Wikipedia wasn't trustworthy because it was user-editable, as opposed to journalists' papers... They offer a very solid mathematical and scientific background, but usually not much in terms of immediately employable skills. I'm not sure whether it's a good or a bad thing: school ought to teach you what you won't learn by yourself, the rest you'll pick up at your first employment, in exchange for a junior salary. But I've got the impression that schools filter mathematically-gifted student more than they train them.<p>Niel seems to concur, and to believe that maths/science gifts don't correlate well with actual development skills. Even if it's not true, there certainly are potentially skilled developers who do poorly at maths and science, and this talent pool is totally unexploited today, so he's right to try and valorise it.",1364320225

Does the peer interaction help that much? Are there any instructors to guide in any way?<p>Personally I'm a self-taught programmer (starting at age 10). I had slight pushes from my dad, and some peer influence from high school friends who were also self-taught programmers. Then I went to college and added a bunch of theoretical knowledge and more breadth (topics I didn't think to study) and depth (topics that I didn't care enough about to dive into on my own). Most of my practical ability to work is self-taught or on-the-job experience, but the schooling does help provide a better foundation for it.<p>So this sounds like it's meant to be a kick-starter to get people to be self-taught who didn't already teach themselves.

An obvious next experiment would be brining up a beef steak and seeing if you like steak when its all watered down.  Or a comparison run, watery beef vs dry turkey, which is ""better"".<p>Something that I think is missing is many of the traditional turkey dinner side dishes are often pretty watery, compared to traditional steak side dishes.  So a dry bird is actually pretty good dining contrast with some wet homemade cranberry sauce or inherently watery green bean and almond casserole or moist mashed yams.  A dinner made entirely of mush is a boring texture.<p>On the other hand, if you want watery poultry, experience it the easy way with ground turkey chili or diced chicken taco meat, or chicken/turkey soup.  I like those too, perhaps partially because of the contrast between them and roasted meat.<p>Not to reopen old wounds but I probably eat more turkey dinner / steak dinner type food due to my sons medically diagnosed food allergies and my general affection for a paleo diet and coincidentally the example I usually provide in person of ""what in the world is left for you to eat once you exclude everything"" is usually something along the lines of think of a stereotypical thanksgiving dinner (or steak dinner) and take away the bread and you're pretty much on the right track.  In that line of thinking if you don't want a dry bird you're much better off simply using a modern electronic thermometer to make sure its not over (or under) cooked than spending endless hours home processing your food.  If a factory brined birds, there would be an outcry about processed foods, but its somehow better if you do it, supposedly.  Actually its probably better from a contamination and food poisoning standpoint to fool with the bird as little as possible while its raw, regardless of any culinary science experiments or dietary beliefs.",1364319097

Her biological father had a habit of staying at home just long enough to get my Grandma pregnant, then taking off. Life for single mothers (especially French Canadians) in the late 1940s/early 1950s was hard. Consequently, my Grandma worked multiple jobs just to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. Grandma was always an incredibly hard worker - she eventually remarried and her and my Grandpa started a cleaning business. She ran that business and worked incredibly hard up until the day she died.<p>My life was very different from my Mom's. My Dad was a police officer and, though we weren't wealthy, I never went without. But, I got to grow up in a household where two things were valued - hard work and education. Consequently, I'd spend summers working in my Grandma and Grandpa's business - I had my first job (with an actual hourly wage) when I was 8 years old and worked every single summer and during Easter break.<p>Grandma never complained because she got herself in that mess and by golly, she'd get herself out. That sense of resilience carried through the generations and now, finally, my generation has the benefits of a middle class upbringing, combined with the work ethic that only comes from having been very poor one generation ago.<p>I think that it's wonderful you're concerned with people who are less fortunate and I respect what you wrote. However, poverty is a great motivator and frankly, I'd rather hire someone who knows hunger than someone who went to prep schools and fancy Universities with billion dollar endowments...",1364318458

There are knives marketed as having been designed with input from various figures in the martial arts world or using terms like ""tactical""; it's probably reasonably to say that those are designed, or at least marketed as weapons. Kitchen knives obviously aren't intended as weapons. Every other non-decorative knife on the market falls somewhere between those two points.<p>Google has evidently decided that assisted opening == weapon, but does not say so on its policy page. This decision is not consistent with the marketing of most assisted opening knives, nor with the opinions of knife enthusiasts. Of course, there are probably very few objective criteria one could use to determine if a pocket-size folding knife is intended to be a weapon.<p>I also reiterate that it is not clear from the page that selling an item banned from advertising (an assisted opening knife) on the same website as an item advertised on adwords that is allowed to be advertised on adwords (some other kind of knife that Google doesn't consider a weapon) is against the rules.

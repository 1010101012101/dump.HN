As you point out, it is the semantics: some of it appears in other functional languages (like doing away without loop constructions) but some are unique to array languages (like using various properties of matrix/vector operations to express certain computations concisely).<p>I am a big believer of linear algebra as a great tool of thought for computation that most people have little to no knowledge of, and the APL family (and actually, Excel) brings home this point.<p>EDIT: And I definitely speak from my experience. I was a professional q programmer for two years, and I came to realize what makes q difficult for many people is not just its cryptic notation but also the general lack of understanding of linear algebra/matrix operations.",1415155982

I love being able to chat about the latest videogames with my coworkers over lunch. I love being able to swap scifi/fantasy novel recommendations and stumble upon test user models named things like &quot;Zaphod.&quot; It brightens my day to see references like that, and having so much common ground to talk about with my coworkers is quite frankly a new and exciting experience after having to deal with being the odd person out through most of my time growing up.<p>But I also can imagine that being forced to deal with what is essentially a foreign culture 24/7 would be really alienating and probably a little frustrating for your average person. No common interests, all these weird references littered through the code and the jokes people make over coffee that you don&#x27;t get because you never played that one videogame that came out in the 80s. And women tend to be into geek/gamer culture less often than men are, so you would see gender discrimination arise out of that, however unintentional. I read a study recently that found that female undergraduates are less likely to say that they would be interested in computer science as a career if asked about it in a room decorated with Star Trek posters vs a room decorated with generic nature posters (<a href=""http://depts.washington.edu/sibl/Publications/Cheryan,%20Plaut,%20Davies,%20%26%20Steele%20%282009%29.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://depts.washington.edu/sibl/Publications/Cheryan,%20Pla...</a>).<p>I don&#x27;t have any kinds of solutions about this.

I realized that, for myself at least, my work group is my only social circle and I have no other personal bonds or social groups.<p>I&#x27;ve only been in one group like that. All of my other more diverse groups, all of which I&#x27;ve loved, I have enjoyed a great work relationship, but nothing in common other than the work. The more diverse a group, the more the focus is on just work, no water cooler talk, no goofing off.<p>If I was faced with a work group I have nothing in common with, the work would be my focus, and I would itch the social scratch outside of work, without my co-workers. Changing yourself to fit into a group is something I figured people just grew out of after leaving high school.<p>The asshole, I agree with you, but that was just the one. The rest of the story I felt was her own projection, in a microcosm we&#x27;ve all dealt with that in the past. As others have said, an HR department is there to diffuse a situation for the company, not help you. She wanted to please everyone else, I&#x27;ve known plenty of people like that, I&#x27;m sure everyone has, they do everything they can, and still feel guilty about it.<p>Being passed up for a promotion is more likely about scratching the back of someone they know than trying to slight her. I know others who have experienced similar things, because the bosses wanted kickbacks from friends of the contractors, or could get a $1000 referral fee. The reasons people are jerks can also be not because of you, your race, your gender, but because they are acting selfishly. I&#x27;ve personally experienced similar situations being passed up and I imagine it was because they knew the people at the company they contracted in. The in house developers yell &quot;we can do it!&quot; but the money changing hands is too good to pass up.<p>By the time she mentions NY or the Bay Area she doesn&#x27;t have a sense of self at all, only the mask. No one else seems to be the oppressor, if I was the odd white male out in a team of a different race and gender I wouldn&#x27;t try to wear their suits, it wouldn&#x27;t work in the same way I&#x27;ve seen people try to fit into groups that they just weren&#x27;t them, but they were discovering who they were.<p>There is a lot of hardship, depression, self deprecation, and terrible treatment she endured. I&#x27;m glad she shared her story, there are other who feel the same about who they are, not just because of race or gender. I&#x27;m glad she is taking action in defining who she is as a person, and how she wants to influence people who meet her.<p>However saying the industry needs to change isn&#x27;t accurate, it is akin to asking for cliques to not exist, for like minded people to not congregate. She changed herself to fit in, she is now defining who she is, the solution is not to ask others to change to make everyone feel included and accepted. She felt changed, so now she wants to change the industry, which includes the rest of the non-asshole workers.<p>I&#x27;ve been in very diverse groups, very homogeneous groups, I spent a year in a group as the only male. The real trick is to do as she is doing now, focus on making a you that you like, then cultivate that pride and energy, until being yourself isn&#x27;t work, but just like putting on shoes.",1415155481

Since the decryption mechanism on the iPhone is tied to chip inside it, it limits a company&#x27;s ability to hand you a corporate iPhone and still be able to monitor what you&#x27;re doing with it, hand it over to the cops, etc.<p>Baker makes the further argument that while Apple can encrypt everyone&#x27;s data to the chagrin of the FBI and the federal government is unlikely to enact any laws preventing it or hindering sales, Apple will have a much harder time doing the same in certain foreign markets.  A country like China will likely have much more political will to push Apple out of the market if their cops can&#x27;t decrypt people&#x27;s phones.

8560214,comment,8559275,8559275,0,0,kd0amg,,,"One of the things that annoys me most is when people suggest that the power of array-oriented programming is in having a boatload of built-in array processing functions with short names. As noted in the article, that kind of thing is simple to build as a library in most languages. There is a deeper thing, built into the semantics itself -- the way operators are automatically generalized to work on arbitrarily high-dimensional arrays, which can be manipulated by the programmer. Append (`,` in J) isn&#x27;t just for tacking a vector onto a vector. It&#x27;s also for sticking an extra element onto every row of a matrix (or every column), or for tacking the rows of two matrices together (or their columns), extending a rectuangular prism with a new plane (along which dimension? whichever you want!)... I&#x27;d talk about 4-, 5-dimensional, and higher if we had convenient prose terms for them. All this is from manipulating how the append function gets lifted to multi-dimensional structures. Or maybe you want to just add a matrix and a vector... do you want to treat the vector as a row or as a column? How about getting an outer product? Operate on the entirety of one argument and individual cells of the other, still just by manipulating how lifting is done. If you haven&#x27;t been messing with verbs&#x27; ranks, you&#x27;ve only had a superficial look at array-oriented programming.<p>This kind of flexibility is not specific to the functions that come in the standard library. It&#x27;s part of the language semantics, so it applies to every function the programmer writes. That&#x27;s a fair bit harder to package up as a library (I&#x27;ve done it in Racket by more or less temporarily redefining function application), so I tend to be dubious of claims to have brought this paradigm into another language. Array-oriented programming is not just a combinator library.",1415154018

Find me a person who says they truly desire for their work—for the majority of their contributions in life—to have no purpose. We all desire it.<p>So the problem, then, is: how do we create a purposeful workplace?<p>Most workplaces operate under a complex inhuman chaos that easily leads to malaise and disengagement. The problems are cultural, structural, and endemic: infighting, passive aggressive behavior, individuality, game playing, ladder climbing, loss of motivation, complacency, self-interest, and more.<p>These are a consequence of an organization which fails to think systematically, fails to understand human psychology, fails to base their work methods on real knowledge, and fails to understand the statistics behind all components human or otherwise.<p>In essence, organizations that fail to achieve systemic quality through these means are the ones which fail to achieve purpose. Aim to improve the system, and the end result and the structure under which it&#x27;s produced improves as a side effect.<p>It is pure and almost zen-like in its simplicity, but instead, lacking the necessary knowledge and the means to implement it, most corporate environments devolve into a haystack of individual-focused complexity, which leads to the dark center of corporate culture which we all dread: the one which robs our work of purpose.<p>Improve the system, understand how every part of it works, and improve everything.

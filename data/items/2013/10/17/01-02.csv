When you hear NetBSD developers arguing about proposals (or commits, ex post facto, like here), there is often mention of &quot;users&quot;. But these are mostly fictional.</i><p>I think this is true of much open source software.  Just for the sake of example, a few years ago the Gnome devs removed some printer config options because they decided the &quot;users&quot; didn&#x27;t need so many options.  It&#x27;s not that Gnome <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have users, but the developers seemed to have some notion of a type of user that didn&#x27;t really exist.<p>I think more often than not, fictional users are used as justification for the addition of some nice-to-have feature, but of course I&#x27;m just speculating.",1381975138

So not supporting FTP is like not supporting POP3 in 1998 when everyone is using it.<p>GoDaddy and Yahoo Hosting, at this time, both support FTPS out-of-the-box and not SFTP. (Yahoo blocks non-SSL FTP connections). GoDaddy only supports SFTP for paid accounts and it requires setup (<a href=""http://goo.gl/a9UFRP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/a9UFRP</a>). There&#x27;s no native Python SFTP library at this time, but FTP-SSL has native Python support. Most non-IT people have probably connected to an FTP site, but probably not an SFTP site. You&#x27;re correct about FileZilla Server, I was mistaken about that. Still, most Linux FTP servers have added support for FTPS.<p>In other words, for better or for worse, FTPS is the direction things are heading in and I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s a good thing or a bad thing.<p>Please don&#x27;t shoot the messenger.

6563202,comment,6562080,6562815,3,0,yk,,,"If the neutrinos have enough energy, then they can just produce a lepton-anti-lepton pair. But for low energies the simplest process is creation of a virtual W pair, that  annihilates to two photons. Trying to explain a bit, because of the uncertainty principle you can borrow energy from the vacuum, as long as the resulting particles are destroyed quickly enough. So for intermediate stage in a process you do not need to exactly satisfy energy conservation, but instead the resulting cross section is suppressed and the  reaction becomes more unlikely.<p>But the neutrino less double beta decay works somewhat differently. In a normal beta decay, a nucleus transmutes to a daughter nucleus, a electron and a anti-neutrino. ( X, X&#x27; are the nuclei, nubar the anti neutrino, e- the electron.)<p><pre><code>    X -> X&#x27; + nubar + e-\n</code></pre>\nIn a neutrino less double beta decay, this is what the article is talking about, the anti-neutrino then reacts with the daughter nucleus to produce yet another nucleus and an additional electron.

That seems a little low to get the indicated range/speeds quoted though - if you assume reasonable efficiency at half power, and that the bulk of power at top speed is aero drag, then the 250W used to ride at 25kmh would drop to doing only 19.5kmh at 125W (power going up with the cube of the speed thanks to the v squared term on the aero drag), so your 90Whr battery will only get you ~15km. If you halve the power again to 65W, and drop to 15kmh, you&#x27;d still only get a range of ~21km.<p>If they&#x27;re LiPo cells though (with their increased fire risks), you can get inexpensively 2600mAhr cells in 18650 size - 22 of them (ignoring the difficulty in configuring a &quot;36V&quot; pack) gives you a bit over 210Whr - that&#x27;d still only give a 32km range @19kmh based on my assumptions above. Cells of 3000mAhr and over are around, they&#x27;d give you 244WHr and get maybe 40km @ 19kmh and _perhaps_ 50km @ 15kmh (but that&#x27;d take you 3 hours 20 mins)<p>The &quot;1000 cycle&quot; battery life perhaps suggests LiPo instead of LiFePO4 (which is more commonly quites as &quot;2000 cycles&quot;).<p>If I had to guess - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a ~100Whr LiFePo4 pack at 35.2V, ad that the &quot;50km&quot; range relies on you providing over% of the motive power and travelling at a maximum of half top speed or so.",1381972356

It&#x27;s not that hard to do the basics, and the installers really guide you through everything. If you do a lot of writing, browsing and emailing, Linux is just as easy to use as Windows. More advanced things like, say, file permissions, yeah I cannot say that they&#x27;re easier, but you had to learn how to use that on Windows as well. That&#x27;s something people often forget since they&#x27;re already used to it. Anyway, if you need any help (pre or post install), there is contact info on my profile.",1381971842

I don&#x27;t think the novelty of having a glass of beer or wine easily accessible at the end of the day ever really wore off, especially since the beer and wine selection constantly rotated.<p>At least in our case it seemed to be more of a social experience for different groups of the company to relax and talk to each other, as the company was maybe 25% devs, not everyone got to regularly work with others from other departments. Sure we could have all gone out to a bar but most bars nearby were always packed with the afterwork crowd making just walking around talking to each other a huge chore (think near the front of a concert style packed).",1381971828

I assert that the far more common case is that the device specs, documentation, BIOS, etc. aren&#x27;t accessible.

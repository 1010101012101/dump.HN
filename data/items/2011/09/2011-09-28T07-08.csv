3046921,comment,3046255,3046756,1,0,jules,,,"One integer variable is enough, because it effectively gives you infinite memory. Three times infinite memory is as much as one times infinite memory. What matters is not the number of integer variables, but which operations you're allowed to do on them. If 3 integer variables i,j,k with operations o1,o2,...,on are enough to encode a stack, then you can do the same with one integer variable x. You just represent i as all the bits in x whose position is 0 mod 3, j as all the bits whose position is 1 mod 3 and k as all the bits whose position is 2 mod 3. Then you just modify operations to only work on those bits that the operation applies to.<p>For example if you have an operation increment_i, and you start with i=j=k=0 then it works like this:<p><pre><code>                                          ijkijkijk...
     start:           i=0,j=0,k=0 and x = 000000000...
     increment_i: now i=1,j=0,k=0 and x = 100000000...
     increment_i: now i=2,j=0,k=0 and x = 000100000...
     increment_i: now i=3,j=0,k=0 and x = 100100000...
     increment_i: now i=4,j=0,k=0 and x = 000000100...
</code></pre>
And if you increment_k then it works on the other bits:<p><pre><code>                                          ijkijkijk
     increment_k: now i=4,j=0,k=1 and x = 001000100...
     increment_k: now i=4,j=0,k=2 and x = 000001100...
     increment_k: now i=4,j=0,k=3 and x = 001001100...
     increment_k: now i=4,j=0,k=4 and x = 000000101...</code></pre>",1317196489

I was shocked when I found that all the Sun's official JVM documentation is available in Japanese.<p>This showed the amount of dedication and respect to Japanese market and companies (many of which invested heavily in Java, I know), but I understand how it can go both ways:
When some programming languages and tools are translated to your language and some aren't, you might become stuck with those which are, and they are perhaps older, limited and less experimental. Limiting your toolset based on the human language is surely a problem. When you have to use tool A and not B and C because B and C aren't and won't be translated to your language (and then you have peer and management pressure).<p>I also remember a few years ago on NH a comment by Dutch developer who claimed that very few books about software development tools are published in Dutch, so they use original English sources and whatever tools are good, but when they come to Germany they see full bookshelves on programming topics in German - so people are reading those instead of original docs and limit their toolset.<p>But there is another thing, maybe Japanese see programming as Engineering. A respected craft, but you don't reuse much of electrical engineering output between projects, neither expect youe engineers to take care of the product side of the product. They usually do what they are told or don't when it's too expensive or would not work that way.
Programmers are pretty distinct: they can reuse, they have to face the product side and they're much less constrained by a physical media so they can go a long way towards a wrong path.<p>Which would probably make Japanese system programming thrive but Japanese customer- or developer-faced software suffer.",1317194185

7078020,comment,7077734,7077734,0,0,luu,,,"Everyone has different reasons for their choices, but speaking only for myself, none of those things matter much to me. Here&#x27;s why I&#x27;m currently at a big company instead of a startup (and I&#x27;ve done the startup thing in the past, so I have some idea of what I&#x27;m missing out on):<p>1. Research-y projects. Big companies have the resources to place long-term high-risk bets on research projects that will probably fail. Some startups have a single such high-risk bet, but you can&#x27;t just decide to work on whatever crazy idea you come up with because the company can&#x27;t really absorb your salary for years if the bet doesn&#x27;t pay off.<p>2. Really broad scope. One cool thing about working at a startup was that I could do whatever I wanted as long it was relevant to the startup. In fact, that was the biggest reason I went with a startup just out of school; I would have been some tiny cog on a giant team at a big company (that&#x27;s not inevitable, but that&#x27;s what the offers I personally had entailed). But I now have enough credibility that I can go off and do whatever I want at a big company. Since the big company has a much larger scope than a startup, there are many more things I can work on.<p>3. Resources. At the startup, I could take 100 machines to run an experiment and it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. If I wanted to use 1000 machines I&#x27;d have to get people to ok it because I&#x27;d be eat into resources that were necessary for the company&#x27;s operation. Now, if there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m curious about, I can run a map reduce across the entire internet.<p>4. Relaxed environment. The vast majority of my team is married with kids, so the office is deserted by 5pm. There are a couple of folks I&#x27;ve seen stay late for a week or two to hit some deadline, but that&#x27;s like one or two weeks out of the year. The startup was one of the most relaxed startups I&#x27;ve ever seen, but there were still month long crunches of 50+ hours/wk as some emergency came up. In principle, a startup could be as relaxed as a big company, but that&#x27;s extraordinarily rare. At the big company, one of the most respected people in the office casually remarked to me that he&#x27;s been at negative available vacation for all but his first two weeks at the company (and he&#x27;s been here for seven years). At the startup, the most respected people all lost vacation every year because pushed up against the vacation cap.<p>5. This should really be like 25 or something, since it&#x27;s not in the same league as the others, but I&#x27;m making a lot more money than I was at the startup.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- there are a lot of advantages to being at a startup, and I&#x27;m glad I spent a good chunk of my career at one. I&#x27;m just saying that there&#x27;s a lot I&#x27;d have to give up to go back to a startup, and the things on that list don&#x27;t even make the top 30.",1389988372

7078011,comment,7076599,7076599,11,0,aredington,,,"One of Clojure&#x27;s fundamental opinions, asserted by the language eagerly, is that vector quantities should be treated as values the way scalar quantities are in most languages. Specifically, this means that when you operate with a list and append to it, instead of modifying the value of the next (cdr) pointer in the last node, you create a new list and return the new list as the result of the append operation. These immutable collections afford certain classes of algorithm that destructively modified ones do not. Rich reviews this concept pretty well here: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values</a><p>This story doesn&#x27;t spend much time discussing this particular opinion of Clojure&#x27;s or why you would choose to circumvent it by making a mutable linked list. Additionally by virtue of skipping the immutability discussion, it fails to discuss how append to the head of a list is crucially different from append to the tail when working with data structurally sharing underlying data.<p>Additionally it prefers to define an interface over a protocol (using definterface instead of defprotocol), and it uses camelCase naming instead of Clojure&#x27;s culturally embraced hyphen-cased naming.<p>In short this describes a way to build a data structure in Clojure, but is not a particularly good as an example to be followed of how you should build data structures in Clojure. johnwalker cited a couple more idiomatic examples, e.g. data.finger-trees: <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/data.finger-tree/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clojure/data/finger_tree.clj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/data.finger-tree/blob/master/src/...</a>",1389988218

Copyleft licenses primarily defend individual liberty by guaranteeing the right of downstream users to modify software and distribute the modified versions, which is the natural state of things (absent state intervention, individuals can modify any software in their possession, and distribute it if they wish). The MIT/BSD licenses are freer in one sense: downstream users may sue other downstream users who use their modifications without a license. I can take a piece of MIT-licensed software, make changes to it, and then if someone uses my changes without a license from me, I can sue them for copyright infringement. The GPL takes away that freedom to restrict downstream users. Considering that the right the MIT/BSD license let you retain amounts to using the machinery of the state to restrict other people&#x27;s freedom to use and modify software, I don&#x27;t see how this is freer in the libertarian sense. At least, not unless you believe &quot;intellectual property&quot; is literally natural property, rather than a fiction created by the state.<p>Now, the anti-IP libertarian position would be in favor of neither the MIT/BSD nor the GPL approach, but simply in favor of abolishing copyright entirely. Then you would inherently have the right to modify and distribute any software in your possession, and wouldn&#x27;t need a copyleft license to ensure you retain that right.

A lot of this was my fault, but it should not have been close to possible for me to graduate.<p>The problem to me is larger than which degree someone graduated in. It&#x27;s that college isn&#x27;t rigorous enough in general, and the only people who see the real benefits of education are people that study the sciences AND are curious and motivated. See, with science, business, and technology, the worst case scenario is that the teacher is terrible and the textbook takes over the responsibility of pedagogy. This, along with a motivated student, is enough to salvage an education.<p>In the humanities and the social &#x27;sciences&#x27; (which, in my opinion aren&#x27;t really science in how we tend to define it these days — and I say that as a great admirer of sociology, political science, psychology, and economics), motivation from the student isn&#x27;t enough to save them from the worst case scenario: the student graduates underdeveloped, unfocused, and scattered with only the seeds of critical mind if the curriculum and teaching is poor. And that worst case scenario happens A LOT since, as previously mentioned, lack of rigor and inconsistent teaching quality is poor across all departments at the university level. With very few exceptions, my social science peers didn&#x27;t have even a high level understanding of the alternatives to a intellectual framework like positivism. I doubt they would even know what I would mean by an intellectual framework or positivism. Technical students don&#x27;t need to know this (though they should), but as a social science student, you can&#x27;t do your most basic work without an understanding of such topics.<p>College has become a replacement for high school, because high school has become a daycare. University teaching is  inconsistent because universities are confused on their role in society. This teaching problem is cross-discipline. However, with the sciences, the textbooks can more or less set an expectation of learning. Other subjects require a very disciplined teaching method to be valuable — the professor must direct the path. Humanities and social sciences require boldness and direction from its teachers, which they can&#x27;t do because the university is a hostile environment for professors.<p>The only solution I see to this problem (on a personal level) is to encourage aspiring college students to choose the HARDEST college (the reading difficulty and writing quantity should terrify the applicant), which explicitly and forcefully values teaching, and has the highest level of prestige (for when it comes time to showing that resume around).<p>If you&#x27;re a humanities or social science major, you should be reading at least a book every week (I&#x27;ll give you 2 weeks for Das Capital ;) and always MULTIPLE books on any topic. Otherwise, you&#x27;re wasting your time and money.

When I was in school we used the Tanenbaum book, even if it was heavily skewed to his belief that microkernels were better (Torvalds and Tanenbaum fought in an epic flame war).<p>At the University of Arizona, we implemented in our class projects various stages of an operating system kernel, such as a process/thread scheduler, user/kernel mode functions, message passing (IPC/mailboxes), locking/semaphores/mutexes, signals, paged memory, and a file system in this upper division course. It wasn&#x27;t as hard as a class like Automata, but it was tedious.<p>However, now that I am doing so much low level work, I can appreciate what we learned in class. In fact, it gives you a strong understanding how critical sections and locking work (and how this all ties in with the operating system). It makes you appreciate simple user mode delegate syscalls like fopen, fork, and malloc and realize that a bunch of things are happening in kernel mode. It makes you avoid naive design choices like while(true) loops and look for blocking/event-based equivalents.<p>So you might groan about taking an operating systems class. Don&#x27;t! You might never ever work on operating systems, but you will be able to appreciate how to make the operating system work for you.

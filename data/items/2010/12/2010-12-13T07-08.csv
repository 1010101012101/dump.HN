GMail is a little different in that Google knows a lot about you in terms of the content of the email and what your current conversations contain, they can then drive specific ads based on those conversations.<p>Facebook knows who you are, your age, your location, what you like, possibly what you dislike, your music tastes, movies, etc... They know who you interact with the most, who you interact with the least and can form patterns of what common interests between you and your friends. They combine all this data to determine what kind of ads will most likely appeal to you. The more you interact with Facebook, the more relevant the ads displayed to you will become.<p>Not sure exactly what else you are looking for here though based on your question.

That's exactly your misunderstanding - MD5 is <i>not</i> an encryption function, but a hashing function.<p>The way it works is, given some string, it will output a new, random-looking string. It's impossible to go backwards, i.e. given the output of running MD5, you can't tell the input.<p>In a nutshell, The way password authentication works is this: when you sign up to a site, a hash of your password is saved. At this point no one, not even the site itself, can tell what your password was.<p>When you want to log in, you send the password over to the site, they hash it again, and compare the output with the saved hash. If you put in the same password, the hash will come out the same. And it's very, very hard to find a different string which <i>isn't</i> your password which will get you the same hash output.",1292226237

To make the matters worse, she got into a house debt, which needs to be repaid for 7 more years (I knew and was telling her that was stupid from the start, but that can't help now). To make the matters even worse, she might get into some legal process for the things she probably never did (scapegoat).<p>I am 19. I have some job, hell, I even dropped from the college to get some real world experience, but I'd never believe anyone telling me that real world experience reaches me so fast. With my salary it's quite probable I can sustain barely enough income to pay the debts and make some living for us both, but I dunno for how long (remote working with salary much above average for our country).<p>I am thinking about moving to some other country, hoping that life'd become easier to cope with there. I am a ruby/rails programmer with some 1.5 years experience and 10 years romance with the computer and I believe that my English is bearable enough to communicate with others.<p>I've always thought there's not a single thing I can't handle, but this is a situation I could never imagine getting into.

Yes, prototype inheritance is conceptually simpler but in practice it's more complex.  In JavaScript, for example, OO code tends to be harder to follow and includes more boilerplate code.  You have to make up for the simplicity of the platform in order to get your work done.  In more traditional OO languages, inheritance might be more limited but it's also more straight forward and easier to implement, calling parent class methods is build in, and the ""this"" reference works consistently.",1292226107

It's not that people are all jerks (though some are), but some people are just completionists (never start anything you won't finish), and other people are there because academia really is the best home for them, and they genuinely feel that it would be a waste for anyone smart and good at research not to finish and go into academia.<p>If you can get over that, though, a few years of grad school without finishing is not a bad deal. If you're in a PhD program (rather than masters) you generally get free tuition, plus a modest stipend that should cover at least rent+groceries, so you end up basically getting to study something for free for a few years. You could make a lot more doing something else, but if your goal is ""learn some stuff about [subject]"", it's just about the cheapest way you'll find to be able to do that full-time.",1292225049

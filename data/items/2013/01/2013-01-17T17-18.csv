I would summarize it as we have a direct participation system, in the form of propositions, that has limited what the government can do.  Specifically, the voters have limited the amount of property taxes that can be raised, required a super majority of the legislature to raise any other taxes, and then gone ahead and proscribed what the legislature has to spend money on, either directly on things like education or indirectly on things like prisons when we pass laws like 3 strikes.  Even when we raise additional taxes, as we just did with Prop 30, we specifically earmarked that money for education.  All this leads to terrible roads.",1358444867

If we can identify offenders, we can simply stop the offense, so issuing any kind of ticket no longer makes sense.<p>This brings me back to a point I made above: the airlines will stop this practice.

First, government press releases like to trumpet the maximum theoretical numbers. Authors of the press releases will just count up the crimes and the add up the theoretical maximum punishments while largely or completely ignoring the reality of the likely much lower sentence. The practice is generally justified by its possible general deterrent value: perhaps word of the high punishment faced in theory will get to others who might commit the crime and will scare them away. And unfortunately, uninformed reporters who are new to the crime beat sometimes pick up that number and report it as truth. A lot of people repeat it, as they figure it must be right if it was in the news. And some people who know better but want you to have a particular view of the case repeat it, too.

What university would actually drop their JSTOR subscription in favour of a bunch of unlicensed PDFs they torrented? JSTOR, in addition to keeping you on the right side of copyright law, gives you all their systems for querying their data, and keeps itself up to date.
Maybe a university in a developing country would drop their subscription, but any in the US? I find it unlikely.
Such a torrent would be far more useful to an individual who didn't have access to an organization that subscribed. However it seems these pay-per-download fees only account for a fraction of a percent of JSTOR's operating budget (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5064408"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5064408</a>).

It doesn't (necessarily) imply that each plaintext has exactly one encrypted version. [1]<p>It's also highly experimental at this point, from what I remember.<p>[1] As a trivial example, let's say you give me a very large number, and your encryption scheme is to add some number, n, of zero bits at the end.  Only you know how many bits you're adding - n is your private key.  Regardless of what you pick for n, I can multiply your number by 2 (i.e. bit-shift it) and give the result back to you, which you would then be able to decrypt to the result of the calculation.<p>This works for any value of n, so I can't tell if two original numbers are the same by inspecting the ciphertexts.",1358442268

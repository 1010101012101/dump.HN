Taking a known compound and searching for every possible form in order to find one that doesn&#x27;t happen to have been documented is in fact something that is &quot;obvious to one skilled in the art,&quot; because it&#x27;s a widespread activity. There are specific rules in the US patent system surrounding this issue.<p>So it&#x27;s not like the drug maker was necessarily whacked by some rogue judge issuing a weird decision out of the blue. It may very well be that Gilead was taking a known risk at the hands of the Indian patent system.<p>Does Sovaldi satisfy India&#x27;s standards for novelty? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve had a patent application struck down over novelty, so I know it&#x27;s not a happy day when it happens.",1421387820

Refugee treaties cover the corner case.<p>> We&#x27;re debating morality here, which is subjective, but I&#x27;m not stupidly deontological. If open borders leads to a world which I rank lower morally than a world without then restrictive borders it is.<p>Then the argument is over, at least for the next decade or two.  Sweden&#x27;s experience provides the last bit of evidence necessary to demonstrate that open borders policy, as currently understood, leads to worse outcomes in Western countries than more moderate immigration policy.<p>I support research into better implementations of open borders, and if people like you act quickly, it might not be too late to correct e.g. Sweden&#x27;s worst mistakes and arrive at something simultaneously more open and more functional there than current US policy.  But this cannot be morally done without citizen consent, and you have no chance of getting that in the US in the foreseeable future.<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll do what I can to help Chinese live better lives back in their home country, and I encourage others to do the same for India and other poor countries.  And I&#x27;ll vote for free trade and related policies.  Because those courses of action, unlike open borders, are actually effective at reducing global poverty today.<p>> An uncharitable interpretation, I&#x27;m quite happy where I&#x27;m working too but I&#x27;d still rather be unemployed in the US than in India.<p>You wrote employed in China vs. unemployed in the US, not unemployed in [China/India] vs. unemployed in the US.

The constraint on the profile of the infrastructure, both horizontal and vertical, in a function of the speed. In the end what you need in an infrastructure with the right profile, and that is where the bulk of the cost is, not in the system that runs on it.<p>I&#x27;m ready to be convinced that the Hyperloop system is cheaper than HSR, but the problem is building the right of way. Viaduct is not a magical answer, we could have a HSR viaduct with soundproof walls. Peninsula NIMBYs successfully killed building new tracks for HSR, where Caltrain already runs (with almost no additional nuisance). Somehow, I don&#x27;t imagine them (or any californias suburban community) being OK with a viaduct going through their towns. A viaduct that couldn&#x27;t be laid on top of existing roads to have the right profile for high speed.<p>There are very few existing roads that are compatible in profile with high speed. And they are located where the right of way is already cheap.<p>Solving the right of way problem sounds maybe less sexy than supersonic travel, but this is where we can gain the most efficiency. I think this is a harder problem than the hypersonic technology.",1421386852

That the firms who make bad bets (or get unlucky) may stop participating, in which case the VC industry becomes better &quot;on average&quot;<p>Or a combination of the two (or is it something else)?<p>C to me seems to be a generic rephrasing of A and B. D isn&#x27;t all that simple since one has to make some nontrivial assumptions data hasn&#x27;t really borne out (acknowledging here that data hasn&#x27;t conclusively borne <i>anything</i> out): e.g. that investment is neither primarily chance or primarily networking effects, that predictive quality of firms is mostly invariant across changing technology, that turnover internal to firms moves slower than turnover in the market, that the damage done to the market by lost capital investment is outdone by better average performance, that firms moving in to replace losers don&#x27;t &#x27;undo&#x27; gains to average, and that there even exist (and that the market can support) enough potential big-payout startups to benefit more than a few lucky VC firms to begin with.<p>Certainly the point is taken that in cases where both harder work matters and where leverage exists (be it slavery, authoritarianism, competition, financial pressure, legal pressure, etc) to get people to work harder, better results are likely to be had. There is a question both to what degree harder work matters in capital investment and also to what degree leverage that exists in private top-down firms does not and can not exist in public top-down firms.<p>One can consider the internet itself as a product of public investment (where there was competition among researchers AND private firms for capital to develop and research packet switching) among countless other examples; namely public investment isn&#x27;t devoid of its own very large successes.<p>In the discussion is also the subject of &#x27;efficiency&#x27; for which reasonable arguments to include &#x27;social income&#x27; exist. Counter to this in the public space there are dangers of conflicts of interest and cronyism (these exist, but less problematically, in private sectors).",1421386836

For the same reason, both the GBA and the DS provided access to the Game Boy&#x27;s PSG audio channels, and many games (moreso for the GBA) used them alongside their &quot;native&quot; audio hardware for &quot;free&quot; square waves and noise.<p>The DS&#x27;s 3D hardware is kinda strange. It only supports point sampling/nearest-neighbor filtering, like a PlayStation, and has an SIMD-like &quot;geometry engine&quot; not unlike it, for calculating matrix transformations and basic vertex lighting, but it unlike the PlayStation, it has a depth buffer, making it significantly easier to program. It has hardware support for cel/&quot;toon&quot; shading, edge/outline rendering, and anti-aliasing, yet only 2048 polygons can be drawn per frame, due to the very limited vertex RAM. It&#x27;s kinda strange that they&#x27;d implement such features on hardware clearly hampered by more pressing issues, but then again, cel-shading with outlines really helps for readability on the low res 256x192 screens.<p>It&#x27;s a very interesting combination of primitive and semi-sophisticated elements, being Nintendo&#x27;s last completely original video hardware before they switched to an off-the-shelf chip with the 3DS.

Companies spend billions researching and testing drugs for safety and effectiveness.  Companies capable of developing successful drugs need an adequate period in which to recoup their investment and earn enough to fund new drug research.  If companies know they won&#x27;t have meaningful ownership over medicines they develop, they won&#x27;t spend the huge amounts of capital necessary to develop them.  When countries like India let competitors produce generics of American drugs, they are stealing the fruits of other people&#x27;s labor.  That isn&#x27;t to say this theft isn&#x27;t justified; generics will save the lives of those who can&#x27;t afford the original.  But those lives would have been lost all the same if no such drug had been developed in the first place.

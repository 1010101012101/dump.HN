2892860,comment,2892616,2892825,2,0,jmreidy,,,"Jasmine is a great library, especially for anyone coming from the Rspec world. The syntax is incredibly similar to Resp, and when Jasmine is written in CoffeeScript, it's one of the most readable testing libraries I've seen (in any language).<p>The biggest benefit to Vows is its ""everything can be async"" nature. This approach makes testing incredibly fast. It's also built in a very modular way that allows for what it calls ""batching"" - which is really just test metaprogramming. Vows-bdd is just using this capacity for metaprogramming, so it's not too much more than a ""mini-DSL"" on top of Vows itself.<p>Vows-bdd is very much inspired by two libraries from Nodejitsu: prenup (a general purpose fluent vocabulary on top of vows) and api-easy (which uses Vows for simple, readable testing of API endpoints). All three of these libraries aren't really doing anything more than pre-wiring Vows tests together. I think it's a reflection of Vows' power that it can be so easily metaprogrammed in this style.",1313528222

Otherwise, what you're fighting with the payment-upfront negotiation is the friction it takes to change any part of a BigCo's ""how do we release invoices for payment"" process. If anyone with title =~ /purchasing/i is involved in your negotiation, give this up.<p>* Equally importantly, the payment upfront clause mitigates a risk you mostly don't have with BigCo's. Upfront payment is earnest money. You need earnest money when the amount of money you're working with is large enough to be worth your client stiffing you over. For a BigCo, almost any first project you do is going to be worth less than that amount; your $15k web project is a rounding error to them, and any <i>real</i> dispute over payment is going to cost them more than $15k in the end, and they absolutely know it.",1313527603

We were pleasantly surprised by how much was already there. The Express framework, in particular, was very nice in terms of features and quality (it's basically Sinatra for node). For most of what we needed, we were able to find a node module that could do the job.<p>We were able to develop this quickly for a couple of reasons. One was that we already knew rails. We used a lot of rails patterns throughout our project. Any rails dev who looked at our directory structure would be feel at home. Another reason was that we had a good understanding of our domain. We were able to anticipate many features and tasks that would have been been expensive (time-wise) to implement later. Another reason is that had 2 week release cycles with demo-able features at the end. This kept things moving at a good pace.<p>And of course, we have high caliber staff ;-)",1313527005

I've looked at Node a few times, but it's so much lower-level than Rails...I'd think it would be more valid to compare it to Rack. What about the other components of a Rails app? What should you use as an ORM? What about views? What about routing? Etc, etc.",1313525007

I had done pretty well in my job and learned a lot. I was a better engineer, better communicator and better person.<p>While I felt proud of the fights I had won on behalf of users (every time you type command-comma and it worksâ¦), making them more productive at their jobs, I felt I wasn't doing enough to help people directly. I didn't want to just make tools to help other people work on big important problems or give them money â I wanted to work on big, important problems.<p>I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to volunteer for the Obama campaign in 2008. What started out as a couple of phone calls turned into two months of solid work, helping register hundreds of thousands of voters and making sure folks found their polling places. I didn't lose touch with the grassroots field volunteer in me, either: I was on the phone, too, talking to regular voters.<p>I wanted to be this inspired by my work all of the time. After shipping another big cat, I left. I spent a month helping Engineers Without Borders Canada (important: not all EWBs are created equal), and went through a leadership development fellowship.<p>While my number one passion is for the environment and energy efficiency â and I'm not doing that â yet, I have been fortunate to pick and choose some really cool projects:<p><pre><code>  - creating an online application process for college and university scholarships\n  - helping EWB Canada win $50,000\n  - doing strategy/UI/fundraising for a network of student-run food co-ops\n  - building a text messaging-based tool to remind people to vote\n</code></pre>\nNow I'm working on TurboVote, a nonprofit service that makes voting by mail as easy as renting a DVD from Netflix. If you've ever tried to track down an absentee ballot request form, voter registration form and county clerk mailing address, you know what a hassle that is. We make it easy.<p>Where this becomes a big deal is not in presidential elections, where turnout is 50-60% (which is pretty shameful), but in local, primary and special elections, where it drops to 10%. But once you're  signed up to vote by mail, you just get the ballots â¦ and you vote â¦ and maybe we get turnout to 15%. It's not a lot, but relatively speaking, it's a big deal.<p>If this sounds like fun, we're hiring a rails developer:\n<a href=""http://blog.turbovote.org/2011/07/were-hiring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.turbovote.org/2011/07/were-hiring/</a>",1313524808

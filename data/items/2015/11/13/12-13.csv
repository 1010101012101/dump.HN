So yes you must know which actor you are querying.<p>This is why we say it is mainly a database for apps. If your queries are always hitting a specific user, then you make that user into an actor. Fully relational, within an user.<p>There is another data type, which is a KV store. But there you are always operating on keys. With the added functionality compared to most other KV stores is that the value can be structured. You can have multiple columns and tables all tied to a specific key and you can incrementally update the value (most other KV stores only support complete rewrites of value).",1447419587
10559552,comment,10553646,10557831,0,0,acdha,,,"> It&#x27;s irrelevant how many people believe in something if they&#x27;re wrong.<p>“Wrong” asserts a level of objectivity which has not been established.<p>My argument is simple: the computer industry has failed to produce general-purpose devices which non-specialists can safely operate. That&#x27;s security threats like phishing, but also just the ever present fear almost all computer users have of installing something which will break or degrade their computer.<p>When a high percentage of people choose to buy devices which are more restricted – and thus safer to use – the correct response is not to crank up the smugness and say that they need better education but rather to ask what we should change to make a general purpose computer safer without going all of the way to the app store model. As the most obvious example, strong mandatory sandboxing could be a big improvement while still allowing a knowledgeable user to adjust the sandbox policies or develop their own.<p>> A billion people believe the Earth is 60,000 years old and was created in a week by an all-powerful bearded deity<p>I find this comparison apt, but presumably not in the direction which you intended:<p>We have a preponderance of evidence that people cannot operate computers safely, ranging from the billions of dollars spent on support and data recovery services to e.g. ransomware being an industry with at least 8 figures of annual revenue.<p>Smugly asserting that people buying safer alternatives is due to poor education seems rather close to the creationists who assert that every hole in their theory is caused by insufficient faith. If that was ever going to work, it would have done so already.",1447419568

What&#x27;s happened over time is employers are gaming the system by offering jobs on minimum wage and the minimum number of hours required for the tax credits to kick in.<p>Often the hours offered result in someone working part time but on hours, such as 10 - 3, that make it impossible to get another part time job.<p>Employers that used to pay overtime now employ extra workers instead. So we have a country where unemployment is relatively low but where a lot of people don&#x27;t have any disposable income.<p>Efforts by the current Government to address this problem are , predictably, meeting a lot of resistance.",1447419314

In Norway we are getting lots of &quot;refugees&quot; which has been safely in non-warring European countries[1], seeking asylum here, simply because its a known thing we have higher &quot;wages&quot; for asylum-seekers than other European countries.<p>It may be cold hearted, and it may not be a popular opinion, but my take on it is that these people stopped being genuine refugees 4000kilometers ago. They are now welfare-shoppers. I honestly don&#x27;t see how anyone can argue anything else.<p>We&#x27;re getting a flood of people right now, and the result is that our asylum institution can&#x27;t scale to handle them all.<p>All historical data suggests that they will all be non-working, non-integrated people, living on government benefits for years to come, and for those who manage to become a productive part of society, they will still be less productive than regular citizens, for a multitude of reasons. Historical data also says most of them wont return, but still will have the same rights to government provided benefits, pensions, etc. Nothing personal, nothing racist, but they will be a net loss for the national economy.<p>All these things accounts to a massive increase in government welfare-related obligations, costs and spending. Now and in the future. Our &quot;future budget&quot; is already too big to handle, accounting just our regular citizens. With this flood we&#x27;re facing future bankruptcy.<p>To avoid that means taking away future pensions. It means we stop maintaining infrastructure like roads <i>now</i>. It means cutting costs all over. The costs are very real.<p>And now Finnish people may fear that such an offer like this will land them in the same situation: That they too will become a &quot;too sexy&quot; target for welfare-shopping ex-refugees. It&#x27;s not fearmongering. It&#x27;s a very realistic scenario. I can&#x27;t say I would blame them for thinking that way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://imgur.com/YDegTCn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/YDegTCn</a>",1447418408

E.g., in the last BI experiment, work effort was reduced by 13% - more than double the effect of the great recession.<p>A much better solution is the Basic Job. You get a Basic Income (which pays less than any job in the market economy) but you need to work for it. You spend a lot less money (anyone working in the market economy doesn&#x27;t get paid by the basic job), you have minimal disincentive for getting a job, and you get some productive output (e.g. parks have less trash).",1447417679

So I could do the upgrade on the servers, one by one, checking everything was ok and after that I could focus on updating the drivers and rewriting the deprecated queries, no need to have everything ready at once.<p>The accessible oplog was another gem that fit my project really well.

That is, the normal floats form a finite subset of the real numbers, and a calculation like x + y will pick the closest element to the true result.<p>In this case, adding the closest floating point value to &quot;0.1&quot; (0x1999999999999a / 2^56) and the closest one to &quot;0.2&quot; (0x1999999999999a / 2^55) gives<p><pre><code>  0x13333333333334 / 2^54\n</code></pre>\nwhich is exactly<p><pre><code>  0.3000000000000000444089209850062616169452667236328125\n</code></pre>\n(Rational numbers with a denominator that&#x27;s a power of two have a finite decimal representation, and that&#x27;s the full one for this number.)<p>However, when printing, one is either interested in a close-enough rounded value (e.g. like some languages print 0.3 by default, or how %.3f will explicitly limit to 3 digits), or an exact representation. The exact representation should be round-trippable, so when you read it back in, you get exactly the same value. In practice this means printing a float z as a decimal value such that the closest float to the exact decimal value (i.e. as a real number) is z. Obviously the full string above works because it is exact, but it is nice to be as short as possible. In this case, the floats immediately before and after our number are exactly<p><pre><code>  0.299999999999999988897769753748434595763683319091796875\n  0.300000000000000099920072216264088638126850128173828125\n</code></pre>\nSo, only printing up to the first 4 is enough to uniquely identify our float: it is the closest one.<p>The 0.2999* float is slightly interesting: it is the closest float to 0.3, and most environments will print &quot;0.3&quot; in exact mode.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of trickery/research around printing[1] and operating on floats: rounding things correctly can be highly non-trivial[2].<p>[1]: e.g. <a href=""http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/FP-Printing-PLDI96.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/FP-Printing-PLDI96.pdf</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Table-maker.27s_dilemma"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Table-maker.27s_dilem...</a>",1447417452

I had not considered the politics of people using basic income as an excuse to withdraw education or health subsidies.<p>- effect on wages can be mitigated in the short term by retaining a (perhaps lower?) minimum wage.<p>- I agree a lot of basic income will be swallowed in rent. but that will be because that is what is important to people with the money to spend.<p>- cost-of-living differences will encourage job-seekers to relocate to cheaper areas. this seems like a good thing. if inner city companies can not find the workers it needs, it will either relocate or provide company buses or something. that seems a much better solution than keeping job-seekers where they are.<p>- non-citizens is a very good point I hadn&#x27;t considered. But then, non-citizens are penalized by requiring visas etc. plus EU nations will be restricted on what they can do to stop EU citizens claiming.<p>thanks again.",1447416661

For example, the leading journal of economics that is &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; has 50% of it&#x27;s articles only from Harvard and MIT. That means 2 schools out of the hundreds who do economics dominate the leading journal. Although Harvard+MIT are good, by no means are they THAT much better over Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton etc. It is obvious that the reviewers are accepting their own people (QJE is a Harvard journal) over other people.<p>The comparable figure for Physics is something like the top 100-odd schools produce the half of the research. That seems like a much fairer distribution.<p>Take the inherent fuzziness of social science research, compound it with prestige gaming, compound with the impossibility of reporting a negative result, and what you get is shoddy research.",1447416019

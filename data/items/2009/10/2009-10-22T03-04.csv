896195,comment,889067,889067,0,0,sever,,,"I used to have ""chronic"" wrist pain for 8 years, and have now been completely pain free for just over a year.<p>Saw many doctors, many bouts of physical therapy, many batteries of tests - steroid injections, nerve conduction, MRIs, rheumatologists, chiropractors, acupuncture, etc, none of that was helpful.<p>In the end exercise cured it. Now and again I had hints that exercise could help, I'd do bicep curls, or reverse curls, and it made the pain recede, but the relief wouldn't stick.<p>A year ago, I started doing wall push-ups, 1 set, daily, in the morning. In the beginning, I couldn't do one without pain. No fixed schedule, I just kept growing reps, still one set, having rest days when it seemed appropriate, probably about once a week. In 3 months I could 100 wall push-ups, with no significant discomfort. I'd also have a break of about 1-2 hours after the exercise, before I had to start typing for work.<p>At some point I added ""finger extensions"" -- wrap rubber band around the fingers, and straighten them, the load is the reverse of typing where you need force to curl you fingers. It seemed like a good idea to balance the load on the muscles. I'm don't recall when I added them in, my best guess is that they helped, I think the wall push-ups were the main thing.<p>When I started, I could type about 5000 keystrokes per day (so about 300 words), with pain, on a datahand keyboard. As things progressed, I increased keystrokes, then eventually switched to a Microsoft Natural keyboard, and recently to a regular one, with essentially no limitations on how much I type, and with no discomfort.<p>After 8 years of pain, my outcome has been nearly miraculous. Perhaps this will be helpful, and I hope a similar experience is waiting for you. Best wishes.",1256183744

896190,comment,890317,895569,0,0,foldr,,,"Well now you're saying something quite different. Before, you said it was ""necessary"" to find out which (if any) gods exist before asking whether or not the existence of various kinds of god is compatible with the existence of evil. Now you're just saying that this particular sort of hypothetical question seems pointless to you. I can't argue with your lack of interest, but there is no reason to think that hypothetical questions in general are pointless; and in the particular case at hand, moral philosophers have learned a lot by investigating these questions. The question of whether or not evil is possible in a world created by a good and omnipotent God is basically equivalent to the question of whether or not it is logically possible for good to exist without evil, and this is a question of fundamental interest in moral philosophy  (whatever one's religious beliefs).<p>It's worth repeating that the scope of the problem is very narrow with respect to classes of deity. There is basically only one kind of God for whom the problem of evil arises -- a God who is omnipotent and wholly good. The problem doesn't really arise in any interesting way for the Gods of non-Judeo-Christian-Islamic religions. For this reason, it's not the case that we have to catalog many kinds of god, one-by-one, and then consider the problem separately in relation to each kind of God.",1256183431

I haven't read the book, but is the only reason you see some of the manipulations as ""positive"" because you are an authority figure to your children and you know ""what is best for them""?

According to the idealized free-market theory, this sort of stuff should be taken care of by the market just fine, by people changing the channel away from the objectionable ones, thus commercially penalizing them to the point where running quieter ads becomes the right business decision. That doesn't appear to have happened, probably because while people dislike loud TV ads enough to write to the FCC, they don't dislike them enough to actually meaningfully change their TV-watching habits (so channels with quieter ads don't really gain a commercial advantage).",1291627985

1974623,comment,1973814,1973814,0,0,Figs,,,"Python's a ridiculously easy language to learn. Here are a few examples of bits of syntax.<p><pre><code>    # comments start with a ""#"" symbol
    [1,2,3,4]  # that's a list
    {""x"":1, ""y"":2, ""z"":3}  # that's a dictionary

    blah = 6  # you can assign things to variables
    asdf = [3,6,1,2] # including lists, dictionaries, etc.

    def foo(x,y,z):
        if x > y:
            print ""X is greater than Y""
        else:
            print ""X < Y!""
        return z - 1
</code></pre>
That's a function called foo taking parameters x,y,z. ""def"" defines a function. Notice that you indent where you normally would (after the def, after the if and else). Python code is typically very readable because of this.<p>Here's an example of a class in Python (I assume you're familiar with classes?):<p><pre><code>    class Foo:
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            """"""The __init__ function is basically like a constructor. 
            This thing here is a docstring, it's used to document a function 
            or class.""""""
            
            self.x = x
            self.y = y
            
        def sum(self):
            # The pointer to the instance is the first parameter.
            # It's usually called 'self', but the name can be anything.
            return self.x + self.y  #note: self.<whatever> for member variables
            
        def __str__(self):
            """"""This function is used to make a human readable representation.""""""
            # there are various ways to do this, but % should be familiar to 
            # programmers of C-like languages. (it's like printf)
            return ""Foo(%d, %d)"" % (self.x, self.y)

    foo = Foo(1,2)  # note: Python is case-sensitive
    print foo       # calls foo.__str__() and displays the result -- ""Foo(1, 2)""
    print foo.sum() # prints 3
</code></pre>
Python allows functions to be passed to functions and returned from functions, for example:<p><pre><code>    def makeAFunctionThatAddsXtoY(x):
        def myNewFunction(y):
            return x + y  # x gets stored in the new function for later use
        return myNewFunction

    f = makeAFunctionThatAddsXtoY(5)  # f is a function
    print f(10)  # prints 15, as expected
</code></pre>
Some people care about this ability more than other people. Python's an easy way to start learning about functional programming if you're not familiar with it yet.<p>There's also some other fairly handy things to learn, like list comprehensions:<p><pre><code>    foo = [3,1,6,206,24,1230,0,1,112,30, 96]
    bar = [x for x in foo if x % 2 == 0]  # all even numbers in foo
    baz = [3*x for x in foo if x % 3 == 0]  # triple everything divisible by 3
</code></pre>
You can access list elements with familiar array syntax:<p><pre><code>    foo[0] == 3  # evaluates to True (note: True and False are capitalized!)
</code></pre>
You can also take ""slices"" of lists to get a range of elements:<p><pre><code>    foo[0:2] == [3,1]  # this statement also evaluates to True
</code></pre>
You can get a description of most functions and classes by typing help(name_of_thing_you_want_to_know_about) into the Python interpreter.<p>The best way to learn Python is to read the tutorial (<a href=""http://docs.python.org/tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/</a>) and play around with it.

1974594,comment,1974392,1974547,0,0,Jach,,,"You're right my comment can be troublesome, nkurz expresses part of my position more clearly.<p>People are free to feel I'm discounting the stimulus and the healthcare package, personally I believe those to be insufficient and a mess, whether they will ultimately really improve everyone's situation is still to be seen and debated (elsewhere). I admit I'm likely ignorant on many minor laws that were passed that are useful to certain groups of people.<p>My assumption on the government making lives better is not that it should come up with more ways to do so, or less ways, but that it should simply focus on the big things and not these little things, which would include giving everyone some rollerblades. I'm also aware that everything has a cost, I don't see how stating that is an argument for anything. Of course government should weigh costs and benefits before rolling out some plan.<p>More concretely and with respect to this specific problem, it's something the government should keep its hands out of. This problem is easily solved by a free market solution of buying a sophisticated (i.e. capable of distinguishing commercial from program) device to do this for you without failing on the obvious cases (as the top comment suggested), the lack of which suggests it's not all that important a problem in the first place. (And in fact, it seems like <i>advertising</i> is the more significant complaint, which is why things like Netflix and TiVo exist.) Plus a good-enough solution exists already: the mute button. If government should be providing any sort of service to better people's lives, it should be weighted such that only those services which provide the best improvement for the best costs should be implemented. Let's talk about the costs of eliminating national poverty, not making sure everyone with a scraped knee can go to the store and receive a free bandaid.<p>Edit: (Yes, I also realize that a failure of the free market doesn't mean there's no problem, but in this case, I think there really is no big deal and the government can stay away.)<p>EditEdit: On the other hand, the government nearly controls public broadcast anyway. Not straight-up censorship controlling but e.g. the recent force-upgrade to digital over analog, the list of words you can't say on public t.v. There are so many issues with this that it's hard to get a clear picture.",1291626640

I prefer looking at people working on a project as a cross-functional team. This involves everyone (the team, product owner, agile master and even sales).<p>From a team perspective, people can work together when they need to, or run off to do research on their own and so on. It is an open experience where the Team figures out on their own how to best work together.<p>In pair programming, developers are FORCED to work a specific way. And that might not be the best way for that developer. I think Mark would have had a much more enjoyable experience in a team centric environment where each person is able to add to the team in the way they feel most comfortable.<p>Agile is about self managed cross-functional teams. As soon as upper management forces a team to work in a specific way, that self managed aspect disappears.<p>I do understand all of the advantages of paired programming but think you can get those and a lot more focusing on teamwork instead of pair work.<p>My two cents.",1291626547

This might save them some time, but I'm skeptical that this leak will create an army of only-mildly-interested attackers who otherwise wouldn't have bothered to find any of these places.<p>That said, I disagree that ""either you stick up for [the] unmitigated leaks or you don't.""  Sure it's an opinion, but I think it's OK to think that the world is best off with some information out in the open, and some information private.  I agree that governments should default to the former rather than the latter, but everything in moderation.<p>If you stand for this leak, do you also have to stand for the leak of all Visa card numbers and account holder information?  Do you have to stand for leaking Google's search history logs, or Tor entry node access logs, or a hospital's medical records?

Today, with Wikileaks, the middlemen who ""establish what is alright for the general populace to see and what is not"" are:<p>1) The set of all disgruntled employees and personnel, and other whistleblowers.  Often their motives are pure, but sometimes not.<p>2) The cabal that runs Wikileaks.  They may well have a better sense of what should be public than the average person, but we're still talking about a small set of humans, and we all have our motivations, agendas, needs, and wants to some extent.<p>You can certainly argue that this is a better situation than 15 layers of government bureaucrats, or a few layers of journalists, but again, I don't think it's unilaterally better in all circumstances.<p>P.S.: There is a heaping helping of intellectual inconsistency flying around concerning Wikileaks; I just think that there is room for reasonable concern in there too.",1291626051

3514570,comment,3513318,3513921,12,0,cobrausn,,,"Maybe this is my inner American Biker showing through here, but to me access to the roadway and the freedom to go where I want to, when I want to, without being dependent on the competency of others to get me there is a huge feeling of freedom.  I can't stand not having my vehicle nearby.<p>When I was younger we lived about an hour away from the city.  There was a gas station and a small grocery store near the out-of-the-way suburb where I lived.  That was it.  Getting my first car was a life-changing event for me that basically allowed me to become as independent as I am today, and 'going out for a drive' was just something I did as a young teen trying to keep himself entertained and trying to find new things to do.  I ended up finding a Navy recruiter, but that's a different story.<p>I'm aware that the costs associated with this 'One Person - One Car' idea might not be scalable over the long term, and we should probably start offloading some of the costs associated with maintaining this paradigm onto the city driver while providing good alternatives.  But I will always have a vehicle, no matter what it costs me.",1327593499

My personal peeve is not that there is too much abstraction, but the fact that people seem to gladly settle for mediocre solutions that require lots of work to do trivial things. I was in the situation where implementing SOAP server from scratch was an order of magnitude easier than figuring how to deploy the existing, standard Java technologies in that particular environment.

Changing public transit access that often as in your city argubaly adds uncertainty to development projects. but i'd tackle this problem from another angle.<p>I think a lot more urban public transportation could be achieved by tackling your mentioned correlation: Property owners benefit by far the most from public transport infrastructure errected nearby their property (at least if underground or not noisy etc.).<p>Even if the owner's property taxes rise, the tax increase usually lacks behind the actual property value increase by some years up to a decade.<p>So if I want to solve it politically I'd:<p>1) get rid of that lacking-behind in property valuation. Then<p>2) maybe add the expectalbe increased property-tax income to my calculation when planning a new subway line<p>3) consider talking to owners. if a subway line is to be errected, I'd propose to owners that I'am willing to errect stations nearby their property if they participate in the costs.",1327593228

3514543,comment,3513318,3514474,2,0,pdkp,,,"""My time is worth money. [...] assuming I work instead""<p>That is a big assumption. I think the assertion that time is ALWAYS money is incorrect. Often, it is just time. At 3AM, or after you stop working, your time is probably not worth $75/h.<p>In your example, you only loose money if you stop working early to account for the drive. So, for example, instead of working 8AM-5PM, you work 8:30AM-4:30PM, in order to still get home at 5PM.<p>With that sort of logic, you could just as easily say that if you work 2 Extra hours each day for a month, the car paid for itself and you still get to live in the country. However, like your example, this assumes your work amount is infinite.<p>So, while an argument could certainly be made for saving money in gas, spending less time driving, or more time with family, unless you decide to take the drive time out of your work hours, the opposite of how most people determine when they need to be at or leave work, you wouldn't be loosing money, only time.",1327593069

There's more to it than just languages, platforms, and frameworks. To me the most exciting thing about programming these days is shared knowledge. We've always had a lot of sharing of source code, techniques, and styles but it feels like now, more than any other time, programming is now more open and accessible to more people than ever before. Yes, it's still hard as ever but the resources available to us like GitHub, sites like Codeacademy, the thousands of free tools circulating have lowered the barrier to entry for anyone with a deep enough desire to push through resources and learn it. Before there were far fewer resources to learn. It was mostly books, classes, and your programmer friend. The web helped but not as much.

It might really be higher or lower, but its still going to be far less than the gas tax.  And sales tax on car incidentals is going to be much less than that.<p>Also, the fact that there are more car users actually doesn't tell us anything about which way the net flow of money goes.  If there are 10 times as many car users, but expenditures on roads is 20 times what it is on trains then there will be a fairly large flow of money from train users to car users.  If spending on roads is only 5 times as much as on trains, there will be a fairly large flow in the other direction.<p>So may I suggest you consider the facts a bit more carefully the next time you try imputing dishonesty to your opponent?",1327592922

I'm 55, and have been programming for over 40 years. My first program solved quadratic equations on an ancient Wang programmable calculator that had 3 (three!) registers. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to compute the intermediates and final results while taking the three coefficients as input, in order, once each. That got me used to being very, very careful about memory. I remember my first program that ran really slowly for large N, and getting my first glimpse of algorithm analysis, and then being very, very careful about performance. And I have spent many hours coding low-level data structures and algorithms. It was a lot of fun.<p>Maybe it's my age, or maybe it's seeing all the libraries with the cool data structures and algorithms already written, but programming is often more about snapping pieces together than doing difficult new things.

The etymology of the word, ""compute,"" was at least subconsciously watching over your shoulder as you sat down in front of these machines. Their utility was clear.<p>They loaded programs. They weren't ""apps"" back then and lacked that commodity feel to them. You had to understand in some way what programs were, how they worked, how your computer loaded them. Their limited resources gave the distinct impression that these were machines. Any sufficiently advanced game required at least a little tweaking to get running. Maybe you needed to add more memory, a hard disk, or needed to set some switch in your operating systems boot loader to squeeze out the last bit of performance from it. In many respects the old home computer was very much a tool or machine.<p>Today programming does feel different. I got into programming partly out of fascination with computers (which at the time required you to know at least a little BASIC to load a program) and partly from computer games. I would type in programs from Byte magazine back issues at the library, modify them, and have a lot of fun. Eventually I started writing my own games. And when I got good enough I started thinking, ""I could make this,"" when I was playing other games. It was easy to see the underlying structures in my head and think about how you would build this thing.<p>Today it's not so easy. When I play Skyrim I don't think that there's a chance in hell that I could sit down at my computer and hash out my own Skyrim. There's a disconnect between how we use computers and how we understand them to work; there isn't any requirement to know what memory is or how to tweak your operating system. We don't even ""load programs,"" anymore -- they're ""apps,"" with all the commodity feel of going down to the store and picking up a new gizmo.<p>We hardly use computers for the ability to ""compute,"" anymore.<p>Programming them... well most of the problems of implementation are largely solved for most applications. So it does feel a lot more like stringing libraries together. Some of this is mostly just an artifact of commercial software development: process demands re-use, etc. Lots of pressure to relieve programmers of the hard work of their jobs. The only times I find myself going beyond libraries is working on ""web-scale"" server applications and finding performance bottlenecks in all of these weird little scenarios. Or sometimes, as you say, writing yet another web framework because the existing APIs of the current crop are forcing complexity into certain components of my applications that could be removed if the library was just a little more flexible. It might also be experience. I certainly don't find things that impress me as much any more.<p>However it's still a wonderful profession and I still love it. It still delights me to open the source to 'grep' or 'cat' and read those old programs. Sometimes I still write an old-school number guessing game when I fire up the interpreter or compiler of some new language I'm trying on for size. And I can still think of applications for technology and programming that are interesting. And more often now than ever before I'm feeling the impetus to teach.<p>There's nothing quite like this craft of programming, even if it can feel a little long in the tooth sometimes.",1327591030

The physical costs of production -- equipment, editing software, distribution, and so forth -- have come down dramatically. But Hollywood's cost structure has <i>increased</i> in this same timeframe, because the costs of big talent have gone up. Top actors, directors, writers, source material, producers, and so forth have commanded steadily higher prices. And the outlays on special effects, locations, and other mainstays of blockbuster filmmaking have increased at a steady pace.<p>We should note that this represents a <i>choice</i> on Hollywood's part. Maybe it's not a monolithic, homogenous, across-the-board choice. Perhaps it's something more like the agglomeration into coherence of a thousand daily choices by a thousand different players in the Hollywood system. Perhaps some of those players -- agents and producers -- have had an outsized impact. Regardless, somehow Hollywood has actively participated in spending more and more each year on production at the same time that it earns less and less each year on distribution and sales.<p>To your point, the banks and hedge funds got into the game because they recognized these inefficiencies on the production side. They've got deep enough pockets to finance some of the production risk, knowing that they'll always be paid back, so hence, it's not actually risky for them. And, since production keeps getting more expensive, Hollywood will always be out looking for more deficit financing each year. At what point the tail started wagging the dog, or whether it actually has, is anyone's guess. But the general observation is that the hedge-fundization of the system kicked into full swing in the early 2000s.<p>To my eye, this entire ecosystem looks to be resting on a very shaky foundation. Perhaps existing mega-talent will price itself out of startup filmmaking, but new talent seems to be headed in that direction at a breakneck pace. And, lest we dismiss ""alternative"" content as the typical, unsophisticated, flash-in-the-pan UGC we've seen on YouTube for so many years, we should take note that a lot of really high-quality independent filmmaking is hitting the charts on Netflix, iTunes, and other sources -- right alongside Hollywood fare. For the time being, Hollywood is in no danger of being displaced by these upstarts. But the mere fact that small fry can get collaboratively filtered right alongside the big fish portends to an eventual disruption of a lot of common assumptions about necessary costs in the Hollywood model.<p>We live in interesting times.",1327590700

It was a Debian machine that I kept religiously up to date (daily cronjob and manual checking). It only had an external SSH port, I used log2ban, and disabled all logins except for one non-root user.<p>I got the common ssh brute force spam. Then one day I happened to be checking logs, and noticed rootkit logs in the /root directory. My server had been hacked! Fortunately whoever had broken in had completely botched it and left traces all over the system. It looked like they had given up at some point, despite having root access.<p>I later discovered that the attacker had used a 0-day openssh exploit that had been released that very morning. For that time period of 24-48 hours between release and fix, my server had been hacked. I only wonder how many other servers were hacked by skilled people that didn't leave evidence behind.<p>So morale of the story - you can't secure <i>anything</i> that is publicly facing on the internet.

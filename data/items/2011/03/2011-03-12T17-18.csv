2317101,comment,2315894,2316172,0,0,nomurrcy,,,"I don't see your point and the authors point being completely contradictory.<p>The purported role of the commodities futures markets is to 'provide liquidity' to commodities producers and consumers and allow them to sell the production (and buy their needs) forward.<p>In fact the futures markets are completely dominated by speculation and leverage. Relatively few buyers and sellers of futures contracts either possess the underlying commodity or have a need for it in the future. Almost all futures contracts are rolled forward. There is much more 'paper' trading than actual commodities exist to back. When leverage is this cheap and loose, (i.e. you have more dollars being constantly created through various borrowing mechanisms) futures tend to be very choppy and whip the spot prices around.<p>The price you pay at the pump is being driven higher by people who neither own nor need oil, but rather have access to cheap leverage and do it because they can and it makes them money. (This is happening in almost every tradable commodity right now)<p>You seem to think that this is just the way the world works. But please realize that these are synthetic contracts that are being traded around: works of legal fiction. If the reason society allows people to trade in these contracts is supposedly due to help the market function more smoothly, why should we not consider alternatives to the current state of affairs?<p>Imagine if there was a futures clearing house and futures contracts could only be originated by commodity producers. (and then only in a decaying relationship to their forward production) The set of all futures contracts in existence would actually have some relationship to the forward production of the commodity. Imagine then that in order to purchase a futures contract you had to demonstrate that a) you had facilities available to take delivery of the commodity and b) that your business wasn't just to trade. (Note: the above will <i>never</i> happen) Do you really think commodities prices would be as volatile as they are today?<p>The poor and middle classes are more affected by rising commodity prices. Even if the bubble will eventually contract (which is what you seem to be saying) Why should they be they be subjected to this just so a hedge fund can make a killing for its customers?",1299952192

It can also bring down prices very quickly and consumers benefit from that.</i><p>That's like me expecting you to say ""thanks"" for returning an item I took from you when it's speculation which helped drive up prices in the first place.<p><i>What speculation really does, in my view, is to insert a component of future expectations in addition to the current supply and demand effects.</i><p>That's exactly what it does. Why do we need that?<p><i>It is not entirely clear to me that adding this expectations component is always bad. It can get out of control when it becomes self feeding, but it can also convey valuable information that allows us to react early to fundamental supply and demand issues.</i><p>React early and do what? This isn't like hurricane preparedness. Again, the point the article is trying to convey is that prices <i>don't</i> reflect supply and demand.

They are the plumbing and the dumb pipe of the 140 character web at the moment. That alone does not guarantee enough returns to justify the billion-plus dollar valuation. Sadly, they don't have any other choice than to stifle the same community that built the tooling which led them to be the success story they are today.",1299950006

What speculation really does, in my view, is to insert a component of future expectations in addition to the current supply and demand effects.<p>It is not entirely clear to me that adding this expectations component is always bad. It can get out of control when it becomes self feeding, but it can also convey valuable information that allows us to react early to fundamental supply and demand issues. We clearly have fundamental supply issues in crude oil and in agricultural products. The blog post is totally wrong on that one. Pointing to falling US demand of crude oil makes no sense in a world where the marginal buyer is in Asia.",1299949748

It may be that the issue is some politically correct goal of some 'social justice':  So, if no child is to be left behind, then in some schools the poor teacher will have to spend 90% of the effort on the bottom 10% of the students, Maybe she wants to get these students 'engaged' -- that's hopeless.<p>For 'engaged', I gave lots of examples, but for the examples I gave I doubt that a significant fraction of K-12 teachers accomplish much of such 'engagement'.<p>In the end, the yelling and screaming about US K-12 education is (A) use the failure of the bottom 10% as a way to say that the system needs to do better and (B) use that need 'to do better' to spend much more on K-12 education and maybe double real estate taxes.

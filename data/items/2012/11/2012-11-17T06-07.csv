Voila, instant boost in the polls.<p>Ok, so that is pretty cynical. But I've had my run-ins with them and frankly they add no value at all. I made the mistake of pointing out that they spent all this time and energy looking for concealed explosives, but if they found one they had no plan whatsoever except ""clear the terminal."" WTF couldn't they just put a re-inforced concrete drop well with a vent to the roof next to the check point?

To me it seems like your examples are the exception rather than the norm. Too many times I find myself reading the exact same stereotypes repeated over and over again: yes, a lot of technically inclined people are shy and their discomfort around other people shows in non-standard behavior.<p>But instead of showing empathy toward otherness, this and other cliches are too often used as an easy to hit target for laughs and ridicule.<p>Not so much in this example. Perhaps not in some of the others you name. But as long as ""the nerd"" is presented as some kind of peculiarity of society, as long as we get described with the same stereotypes again and again, as long as we're not accepted the way we are, I think it's worth pointing out that we don't like to be stared at, we don't like to be laughed at, and we don't like to be labeled. We deserve better than being looked down on as ""just the tech guy"" who's just good enough to help set up the new wireless router.<p>Again, I agree that this article is for the most part actually pretty good. We need <i>more</i> articles that portray us fairly. But even this one still yields to the temptation every now and then, for instance with the choice of the photo, an allusion to table-top RPGs (""Hatch was playing the role of dungeon master"") and the n-th iteration of certain cliches (""He, too, has a memory that all nerds share: Late at night, light from a chunky monitor illuminating his face, fingers flying across a keyboard, he figured something out."")",1353135076

4797448,comment,4797036,4797328,10,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">I suspect the national parties (or perhaps especially the GOP) will have to devolve into more than 2 brands for healthy regional competitiveness.<p>I think you're underestimating said bias toward two parties. Unless we switch to approval voting or the like, you'll never see a stable third party in this country. The simple math makes it so that given any three parties, the two most similar parties have the incentive to both back the same candidate, because the alternative of running opposing candidates invariably leads to those candidates splitting the vote and giving the election to the least similar party. And by the time they're both backing all the same candidates they might as well merge into one party.<p>The thing that can happen, and could achieve a significant improvement, is for a new party to come about that <i>replaces</i> one of the existing parties. That allows you to throw out the old leadership and start over with a clean slate.<p>The biggest difficulty is in building a stable coalition. If you want to eject the religious zealots and the climate change ""skeptics"" and the imbeciles who want to keep government out of Medicare then you need to replace them with something that supplies an equivalent number of votes and/or campaign funding.<p>Tech is a good start, but it might not be enough on its own. But the nice thing is that once you've decided who you're <i>not</i> going to invite into the tent, you know exactly whose ox to gore. I have to imagine a fiscally conservative-leaning party would have a lot easier time capturing the votes of centrist Democrats if they were pro-choice, pro-science, pro-education, pro-alternative energy, etc.",1353134547

It is true that Paul is unfairly (perhaps unjustly) portrayed by the media as, to put it plainly, crazy but whining about how unfair it is won't help matters.<p>Ron Paul's message places personal, financial and social liberty at esteem and condemns government encroachment on these liberties. His career as a congressman is consistent with his message which is saying more than can be said of any other politician. For these reasons, the man deserves to be heard and he deserves your respect.<p>The least anyone could do is read the actual transcript of the address--techcrunch doesn't do it justice.<p><a href=""http://m.washingtonexaminer.com/transcript-ron-pauls-farewell-address-to-congress/article/2513544#.UKcsTZG9KK3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.washingtonexaminer.com/transcript-ron-pauls-farewel...</a>",1353133240

The sales man has spent ages with the buyer rolling out his well learned techniques. This is helped if the buyer uses up as much time as he can bare. Which means unless he makes a sale, he has totally wasted his time. Time is money.<p>So, just at the point where he has totalled up his oh so great deal for you, and just as you are about to pay for the items, stop. Turn to the sales man and offer a deal of your own.<p>Two things happen. You have just taken control back of the whole sales routine, which suddenly changes your position completely not least because it refreshes your own sense of control. And second, the sales man is totally set off balance and facing the loss of the sale and his time. You can give a whole load of his patter straight back. ""Because you are such a great sales guy, I would hate for you to lose this sale"", ""This offer of mine is a one time offer,  could go home and order this lot much cheaper on line"", etc.<p>At that point I start by offering 25%, yes 25%, and seeing where he wants to go. My reasoning for the low percentage is that is sends out a message about how much I value the product, and that despite everything the sales man has said, it hasn't worked. But, I might buy at a value I feel is right for me.<p>Having done all that, the pressure is off you, and you are freed up to make a rational decision, and being back in control makes it much easier to say, ""No, thanks, but I'll pass today.""",1353132622

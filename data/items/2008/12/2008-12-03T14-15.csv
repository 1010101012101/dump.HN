There isn't any better way.<p>But I've also noticed that non-geeks tend to signup for a lot of junk stuff out of curiosity. Ex: I get mails from a dozen new social networks everyday saying that my friend has signed up and is waiting for me to get on the site (sick).<p>And forwarded mails(read junk. most are so) are a better examples.<p>And they won't return anymore if it isn't a good site.<p>So it should be easy to get people(non-geeks) but if they like it they will surely go on with your site. I teach a lot of old guys around me(includes my father) about how they can use simple tricks to use the internet better. And it goes on spreading among people in their age group and friends circle. And it does so because it isn't boring. If I taught my dad how to get a Merb app running then he would probably be thinking about the next month finances or the flavor for tomorrow morning's coffee.",1228315279

384351,story,,,4,5,spoiledtechie,"Ask YC: I am a blogger and got asked to do articles... Haven't decided.",,"I just started blogging a couple of months ago and I guess my content is good.  My current blog is spoiledtechie.com.  I was just recently asked to submit articles at www.dreamincode.net.  I don't think I want to do this.  I am not sure if I should take up the offer.<p>I started blogging for the sheer joy of getting better at my grammar and getting my name out there in the world.  I have been shooting for something great, but don't know where it could lead.  I am questioning whether I should do this or not.  It might get me some publicity, but other than that I don't know of anything else it could do for me. Another thought is that spoiledtechie.com content will be there for ever as long as I pay for it.<p>The people at dnc will then be able to make money off my content forever...  Do I want that?  They pay me what, like $100.00 or something per article, but over time, I would probably make that same amount of money over time for each article. I declined to blog at www.asp.net for the same reason.  I want to own my articles.<p>I have also heard that its the companies in the world that hold out and don't sell them selves cheap, that end up making a great product.  I think my blog is just like that.  I have a great product, but wonder if I wrote articles for dnc, would I actually get real publicity from it?  I want to be recognized some day down the road as a great programmer and thats why I mainly write to my blog.  So the question remains,<p>Should I hold out?
Should I go in for the publicity?<p>I am not a selfish person and wish to share with my community that has given me a lot in return.  I am just wondering how good of an idea is this?<p>Should I or shouldn't I?<p>Has anyone ever done this and regretted it?",1228314945

384335,comment,382899,383844,0,0,jbert,,,"> Bribery is not a huge obstacle to a determined entrepreneur. You just pay it like any other tax.<p>But it's not just bribery. It's about being in or out of favour. It's about irrationality and lack of transparency.<p>If you know that the current telecoms company has the brother-in-law of the president on the board, do you think that paying some bribes will be sufficient to allow you to enter the market?<p>How about if you <i>don't</i> know whether that's the case, but you <i>do</i> know there's a reasonable chance that your startup business will be blocked for a ""non business"" reason like that?<p>All of these factors act to reduce the likelihood of return on investment and increase risk.<p>I imagine also that bribes also fluctuate a lot with regard to frequency and amount. That makes them hard to plan for.",1228313024

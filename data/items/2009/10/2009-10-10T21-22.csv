873913,comment,873868,873868,0,0,jnaut,,,"The answer is - ""It depends"", on a lot of parameters like:
1. Do you need a dedicated box or a virtual OS on a shared box will do?
2. What are your avg monthly usage requirements- box and bandwidth? And how these requirements shall change of time.
3. You want to customize you box's configuration before u rent it?
4. You want to pay monthly or yearly or more?
5. Will you need additional throw away on demand computational nodes? How often?
6. Do you just wish to use servers or other services like S3, SDB, SQS, cloud-files(rackspace)?
Many more ....<p>So I think if you describe you requirements and budget better, the suggestions provided will be better.<p>About problems like low speed, outages, etc. Yes both have their own set of problems, but still a more relevant answer can be given when you have illustrated you requirements.<p>I have been using EC2,S3,SDB for one of my projects(last 4 months) and Rackspace/Mosso cloudserver for another (last 3 months). Since the durations are short I may not be able to explain everything, but will try my best. :-)",1255211690
873912,comment,873868,873868,0,0,byoung2,,,"I use all of Rackspace Cloud's offerings (Cloud Sites, Cloud Servers, Cloud Files) and I've been satisfied so far.  I also use GoGrid for more advanced applications, as they offer free hardware load balancing and mountable cloud storage.<p>I'm assuming you're interested in Cloud Servers vs Amazon EC2?  Depending on your usage (mainly bandwidth in/out), one or the other may work out slightly cheaper, but for the most part they are about the same price (although with Rackspace, support is free and very good).  A huge advantage to Rackspace is that the instances can be resized on the fly, and they allow bursting.<p>For example, a 2GB Cloud Server (based on server RAM) is 1/8th of a quad core 2.4GHz server, but that is a CPU floor, meaning that 1/8th of the server's resources are guaranteed, but if you have a brief spike and there are sufficient resources on the host, you can burst to 100% of 4 cores.  With EC2, you can never go above the allotted resources.<p>As far as outages go, Rackspace had some bad luck with their DFW datacenter this year, but I wasn't affected.  The SAT datacenter seems to be more stable.",1255211674

(2.a) Effect on total volume: should have no impact, as the parts we have reassemble to an object of known volume<p>(3) move the subsets around by sliding-and-rotating them
(3.a) Effect on total volume: should have no impact, as neither sliding nor rotating changes volume<p>(4) wind up with 2 spheres (both 'nice' sets, each with ""volume"" V)???<p>The paradox comes from getting double the volume through a sequence of operations that are apparently volume-conserving.<p>You can go with this a couple different directions.<p>I'm not convinced this <i>should</i> be an intuitive outcome.<p>An intuitive, hand-wavy explanation for what's ""really going on"" would be something like non-measurable sets carry around infinite amounts of finely-detailed structure (too finely-detailed to perceive using our measuring tool); depending on how you position some sets relative to each other their finely-detailed structure might either cancel out (adding no volume) or reinforce each other (adding lots of volume).<p>That said I think the real lesson here is that your intuition is trying to have its cake -- a non-measurable set -- and eat it too -- have the ""volume"" of a non-measurable set be preserved under volume-preserving operations.",1255208659

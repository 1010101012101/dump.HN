2685513,comment,2684012,2684157,2,0,tzs,,,"> First to file trumps first to invent? That sounds awful and a step backwards?<p>How so?<p>Are you thinking it means that A can invent something, B can see it, and then B can rush to the patent office, get there before A, and get the patent? That's not a problem, because B is not an inventor in this case and is not entitled to a patent.<p>All first to file really means is that in the case of two independent inventors whose inventions overlap, the patent goes to the one who files first. That person is still subject to all the usual requirements for novelty, utility, non-obvious to one skilled in the prior art (and note that the other inventor's invention might be prior art if it was disclosed).<p>With first to invent, you have the problem of determining which competing inventor actually invented first--which is often quite subjective (many inventions develop over the course of a long stretch of research, and saying when exactly the inventor actually had the inventive step is not well defined), and involves a lot of interpretation of things like lab notebooks, recollection of discussions, and stuff like that.<p>First to file is much cleaner--just look at the timestamp on the filing.",1308779646

2685484,comment,2682799,2682799,1,0,JakeSc,,,"[My comment on the blog post follows.]<p>Great post.<p>Dug is absolutely right in saying that our present difficulties in computer security lie not with brute-force flooding of pipes (i.e., DDoS), but rather with targeted, strategic attacks on smaller subsets of systems (think Stux).<p>However, I would disagree with the statement “users are the new target”. Indeed, it is far easier to gain access to resources by attacking the users who control those resources. But I think it is far more damaging (and therefore lucrative to the adversaries) to attack infrastructure systems on a wide-scale. People may be the initial entry point of the attack, but I still think the greater target is technology behind our infrastructure.\nSteve, you have addressed the very important point that much of our infrastructure (economic, transportation, military, …) is based on on solid systems operating securely and reliably. Let us call these critical systems. These are the ones that are vulnerable to crippling cyberattacks.<p>I posit that our infrastructure should not be based on these systems at all.<p>Any critical system should have no connection to the Internet. In fact, it should have no <i>concept</i> of the Internet. One might go so far as to say that any critical system should have no I/O with the rest of the world. (Recall that Stuxnet was thought to be propagated initially by USB.) This would help ensure that infrastructure-crippling cyberattacks do not propagate. Though preventing a system from communicating with the outside world will drastically reduce its value in controlling our infrastructure. This is the unfortunate nature of the security-versus-usability problem.<p>How do we secure ourselves? Let us hope that we will simply enjoy a “new spring”.",1308779271

And back in the 1990s I used to be an immigration lawyer for a small law firm on the west coast. Yes, the personal story of Jose Antonio Vargas is rough on him personally, but a better basis for setting the policy of immigration in the United States would be the stories of the many people who patiently wait in line to be admitted to the United States through legal channels. Look at their stories, and figure out what change of rules and incentives would bring in what subset of those people to become new Americans.<p>Every country on the planet appears to have restrictions on immigration. Most of the time we don't discuss the policies of countries other than the United States in new submissions to HN, even though HN is an international forum, because most countries are lousy enough to be entrepreneurs in and lousy enough to live in that no one on HN wants to immigrate to those countries. (Instead, most people on HN discuss how to get OUT of dozens of other countries around the world, and in many cases how to immigrate to the United States.) When we consider that the actual number of legally authorized immigrants to the United States each year is one of the highest such numbers in the world (does ANY country have more legal immigrants each year?), it's hard to make a case that the United States is missing out on immigrants by its current policies. Perhaps there are some policy changes to be made on the margins, and on my own part my policy preference would be to make immigration to the United States legally easier and much more commonplace, but the way to make the case for policy reform is to show law-abiding Americans that the policy changes help their lives. The Americans I know, including many law-abiding first-generation immigrants, want policy reform that makes like better in general for all people already in America, as well as for people intending to immigrate here.",1308779073

A first offense for knowingly hiring an undocumented worker will be met with fines and the fines increase through the third offense. The government however has been increasingly using criminal penalties. Hiring more then ten will also much more often result in criminal penalties including prison time. Aiding and abetting, hiding from detection or encouraging aliens to enter the country is a felony unless I misunderstand the penalties in Title 8 and I know for a fact that's what one client we did an audit for is being charged with. Knowingly accepting fraudulent documents on the Form I-9 is punishable by up to five years in prison due to the certification statement in section two.<p>Detection rates of undocumented workers are mostly low due to employers not caring or not understanding what their requirements are under the law and lax enforcement by ICE/DHS. ICE however is stepping up investigations and just sent out another 1000 notices of intent to businesses of all sizes. We specialize in Form I-9 compliance and we constantly detect undocumented workers as part of that work. Companies that are enrolled in E-Verify are preventing many undocumented workers from even applying for jobs. Both the Senate and House are looking at bills that would make E-Verify mandatory for all employers which would make the detection rates a lot higher than they are now. Rumor has it that Senate Dems will kill these types of bills unless the Dream act passes but we'll see how long Reid can keep that up.",1308778665

I mainly do desktop computing, and lots of it, but pretty much all I ever need are four ""apps"": the shell, a browser, an email client, and Emacs. That's what I use 95% of the time. Then a PDF viewer, OpenOffice.org, and every now and then the Gimp or Inkscape. So basically, 10 apps is all I need, too.<p>But at the same time, if I scroll through synaptics there are many, many packages that I have installed over the years. Most of them I probably used only once or twice, unless they're libraries.

Towards the beginning of the deck in one slide he says 'MongoDB is fast.... until your data / indexes no longer fit in memory'. Later on there's the '120GB of data in MongoDB became 70GB of data in Postgres'. The next slide talks about using short key names + a key-mapping layer to preserve space.<p>While using longer key names in your objects will lead to larger objects / larger storage requirements, indexes do not contain the names of the keys of the documents they are created on, so if I have 10M documents in a collection and an index on a field 'ts', that index has the same size as if the field were named 'timestamp'. It's only the storage of the object that grows in size, and by the time you are handling 120GB of data it's very reasonable to imagine you would be using Memcached in front of MongoDB to obtain the actual objects.",1308777254

I think the majority of the user-base doesn't know MongoDB isn't durable out of the box.. they think it's just a ""faster"", better MySQL.<p>Doing solid research goes a long way to tone down the hype.",1308776526

If we had more faith in auto-sharding in MongoDB 1.6, that may have worked (however horizontal scaling wasn't our only issue with MongoDB).<p>With PostgreSQL we manually partition the data (luckily we have a really nice key to partition on).<p>PostgreSQL 9's streaming replication has been adequate so far. We've only been using it in production for a few months and recently moved off of AWS* which drastically reduced our error rates overall.<p>* <a href=""http://urbanairship.com/blog/2011/06/01/hybrid-cloud-were-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://urbanairship.com/blog/2011/06/01/hybrid-cloud-were-up...</a>",1308776509

It may also be that girls don't mind being perceived as bossy?

7910101,comment,7906501,7909465,2,0,SEJeff,,,"It was a bit of both actually. We had this thing called an RVT (Remote Video Terminal) which was essentially a badass hardened laptop encased in steel running a lightly modified Redhat Linux 9 that attached to a small directional antenna. You could send 1 UAV operator who was trained in the RVT down to an Infantry TOC (Tactical Operations Center). He could hook it up and have it find the UAV in the sky and then show video to the infantry commander live. Yes it could be encrypted but the issue was that the bandwidth requirements of high res video + encryption were too great for the current hardware. Again, I believe that has been solved now that the tech has gotten much better, but I&#x27;ve not been in the military since 2005.",1403099962

That has been case since the WP/Joomla/Drupals off the world came into existence. I don&#x27;t see a trend though, in fact I think all 3 of those are growing.<p>For some companies a custom CMS just makes the most sense. It doesn&#x27;t really reflect anything on the off-the-shelf cms-es.<p>And static site generators are not exactly taking off like crazy either, in terms of growth.<p>Choice is always good though.

7910063,comment,7909636,7909636,1,0,danbruc,,,"I used to think that - at least sometimes - redeveloping something from scratch is a good idea but in the last couple of years I realized that this rarely if ever the case. The problem is that you will introduce a lot of new bugs and reintroduce bugs that got fixed long ago. There is no good reason to believe that you can develop a piece of software without making hundreds of the common small mistakes that just happen - off by one, switched sign, missing null checks, you name it. And even if you have to deal with one of the worst code bases you have ever seen, the developers will already have spent countless hours wiping out such problems. Starting from scratch not only means getting rid of bad code, it also means throwing a lot of useful work overboard.<p>So if I have to deal with The-Worst-Code-Base-Ever™ I create a new project and copy the code into the new project file by file in the order you would develop from scratch and clean it up before moving on to the next file. Improve the naming, split large functions, extract common code, unify similar code, look for and fix bugs, improve algorithms, comment out code that references code not yet in the new project or code not yet used and when there is a good opportunity improve the architecture - given that you already understand the code base well enough. It takes time, you touch some files a hundred times and move around bits and pieces seemingly forever, but I am pretty confident the result is better than rewriting everything from scratch. All this might be not such a good idea without good tool support, but if moving and renaming things or changing function signatures project wide is just a matter of seconds, there is real value in doing it incrementally instead of trying to do and get it right all at once.",1403099667

Therefore, we can change the device logical output of 1 or 0 by changing the charge output as positive or negative.<p>However, to change the charge of a piece of metal from positive to negative (or neutral to negative... it doesn&#x27;t matter because we&#x27;re worried about relative change), you need to physically move electrons (charge) on or off the metal.  This movement of charge is real &#x27;work&#x27; if you&#x27;re unable to fully recover the charge when the device changes state.  This results in spent energy.<p>Leakage current is important to consider mainly for power and heat transfer. As we require devices to increase computing performance and decrease power consumption, it is important to use techniques that economically reduce power. As power consumption of a chip increases, the spent energy of a toggling transistor becomes heat that needs to be removed in order to ensure proper functionality (in the worst case, the chip burns itself up).  Therefore, proper thermal simulation and validation must be made at the system level (depending on what type of designer you are).",1403099227

We&#x27;ve traditionally used Drupal, although we use almost zero of the CMS-functionality of Drupal (hence why we were looking at SSGs). We&#x27;re using Hexo for this deploy. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve found:<p>- For complex web pages with a lot of design, we have to put most of the content into .jade files - mainly because of the style of our webpages (long-single-page style with a lot of sections).  If we were doing a more traditional page structure, then we could have markdown files.  This is &quot;ok&quot; but requires content authors to get into .jade files which can be a little intimating.  (if anyone has any thoughts about how to get around this, I&#x27;m open to hear them).<p>- We&#x27;re storing the files in Github, but have now figured out that if we want a distributed team to work on this, we&#x27;ll need something like Jenkins to auto-deploy to a staging server on commit.  The problem is that the first thing people want to do once they&#x27;ve made an edit check the page to see if it worked.  This is trivial in WP or Drupal, but without Jenkins in place, I don&#x27;t see an obvious way to do it unless we have the content folks run Hexo locally (which I&#x27;d like to avoid).<p>- Huge improvement in the speed of the site vs. the Drupal website.  Not shocking given the move to static files, but there is also a reduction in javascript - some of which was coming from Drupal.<p>- Nice to have all content under source control.<p>All in all, it&#x27;s a bit of a mixed bag at the moment - the SSG is supposed to be a simplification of our stack, but now we have to run Jenkins to manage deploy (probably not a bad thing but no one here is an expert in it), and our content people are finding it a bit intimidating.<p>My worry: we setup all this stuff, and then someone key on the engineering team leaves and we&#x27;re left with an overly complex stack vs. just going with Wordpress.",1403099008

They also provide clean syringes and anti-conception, they provide books and newspapers to read, facilities to exercise. Maybe most important, they provide advice and counselling and give people a way to get things back on track, if they want to take it.<p>The national government provides them with monthly income (welfare). Which I will agree isn&#x27;t much, but should cover the absolute basic necessities, especially combined with all the other help available. The local government also helps people to actually receive this money, to prevent the bureaucratic nonsense of homeless people needing to supply an address to apply for welfare.<p>To accomplish all of this, we pay a relatively high tax. But many people still give quite a bit of money to their favorite charities.<p>Of course, all of this requires the homeless person to cooperate. The system handles most of cases quite well, there aren&#x27;t many beggars around, despite being a popular tourist destination. The groups who are not covered fall mainly in the categories: criminals, drug addicts, people with psychological problems, homeless by choice or lifestyle.

I think if you study psychology and the evolution of the human mind that&#x27;s pretty obvious.<p>Additionally if you want to reason in a framework of debts, then you probably owe the most to your friends and family. You owe your entire existence directly to your parents -- it&#x27;s hard to top that! Might as well stop there and just accept you have some unquantifiable amount of direct debt to the family who raised and protected you and the friends who spent time with you freely as opposed to doing something else. You can try to talk of indirect debts owed to and by &quot;society&quot; etc. but those quickly become spaghetti and in my opinion nonsensical. They&#x27;re diffused and for some groups entirely non-existent, their lifespan is indefinite (you owe a part of your existence to all the warriors on whatever side of the conflicts your victorious (where victory means they could reproduce or their existing children were spared) ancestors took part in!), it&#x27;s usually very unclear just how much is owed to whom, if it&#x27;s even quantifiable, and how or if one can repay, and if you allow counterfactuals (like indirectly owing part of your existence to anyone who has had ill-thoughts toward your mother while she was pregnant or you during your life, but who didn&#x27;t act on them) it becomes ever more ridiculous. And this is just as a reasoning framework -- can such a ridiculous construct actually motivate people to donate to some charity feeding starving kids in Africa and generate warm-fuzzy feelings of similar magnitude to gifting and helping out friends and family?",1403096939

I have witnessed wealthy people made to feel like paupers when a yet more wealthy person puts on a display that they can't afford. The phenomena is actually quite comical.<p>Still it's fairly clear that wealth will always be a measuring stick that people will use to display their relative worth. It's like plumage. A lot of resources go into growing those fancy tail feathers. In itself I don't see anything wrong with that. It's quite natural.<p>However it's important for societal cohesion that the absolute wealth of the average does not fall and that they can maintain some semblance of dignity.",1294293588

I had some major insomnia as well, but that's been an ongoing battle. I knew WAY more about ADHD than the two different docs I saw. Primarily because I had a breakdown and read dozens of books on it before I realized I really needed help. I was working for a big law firm over the summer and just lost it. I had trouble working a lot in a mundane job I didn't like and I struggled big time. The most important thing is to find ways to do what you like. I can remember times where I'd slept 10 hours and woke up to read for class and fell right back asleep. You subconscious is a pain in the ass and when you have ADHD it can be nearly impossible to force yourself to do things you don't want to do. The only reason I was able to titrate my meds and play around with the dosage a lot was because I was very articulate with my doctors. I would explain what I read, how I felt, why I wanted to try different things and they were supportive.<p>Far and away the best treatment for insomnia was to workout--hard. That's what Ratey's book is about. Not the vanity like I'm going to try to get jacked workout, but stressing out your body to the point where it focuses on rebuilding your body so your brain is forced to relax.<p>I've often thought about how I'd raise my own kids (married, but no kids yet). I think I would let me kids fucking explore and play with them a ton. It's hard being a square peg and fitting in the round hole of compulsory education, but there has to be a better way than just letting him/her flounder like my parents were forced to with me.

I still recommend at least starting with their recipes though of course we branched out once we were comfortable with the idea in general.<p>The primary effect of working for freezer foods is simply the loss of range; obviously you can not, for instance, freeze a lettuce-based salad. I say that's the primary effect precisely because losing flavor and quality is <i>not</i> the primary effect. Freezer food probably has the single largest quality gap between commercial food and home-prepared food there is. Some meals take a slight hit, many you can not tell, a small number actually have their texture slightly improved by freezing them. If this sounds interesting I strongly recommend trying it, a bit of Googling will probably scare up enough resources to try a couple recipes without even investing in a book.",1294290540

I looked into it a little bit and am not sure if it's possible, at least with Amazon.<p>The idea was to allow users to sign up and receive random items ordered off of Amazon.com once a week, month, whatever. The user wouldn't know what was ordered for them until it arrived.<p>Why? People enjoy receiving packages in the mail - it's fun.<p>You'd be able to sign up and pre-pay like $100, or however much, and specify your maximum item price-per-purchase. So you could say ""do not buy items more expensive than $10"". You could also specify the interval for purchases to be made - weekly, every other week, monthly, whatever. You could specify categories to receive items from - not like Books, Electronics, etc, but more like Technology, Fun, Random (ok, perhaps specify books, electronics, and stuff too). This idea would be even better if you didn't have to pre-pay, but could somehow allow the service to make purchases with your paypal account or something.<p>This wouldn't have any real purposes other than to have fun and receive random fun things in the mail.<p>Business model? Amazon will pay you for referrals. Perhaps even include tons of retailers and provide an unbiased selling platform for them.<p>I looked into this and was able to whip up a quick program that grabbed random items from Amazon and took into account categories. It doesn't look like it's possible to automate purchases on Amazon, though. I also don't know how you'd automate buying items for the user unless you made them pre-pay.<p>What do you think?

The general gist is that the government has terabytes of very interesting data and very limited resources for publicizing it.  The NYT knows this and they totally kill it by turning CSV files of population statistics into compelling, actionable presentations that tell a story.  <i>You can do this, too</i>.<p>With a little creativity, 1 GB of Bureau of Labor Statistics data becomes several hundred pages of rather interesting content for the client's niche.  Google doesn't particularly love raw data in terms of rankings, though, so the graphs got beefed up a bit with content written by TextBroker writers, stock photos, and the like.<p>The business goal is that eventually most of these pages will rank for, e.g., [computer science degree average salary], and that some portion of searchers will request an application packet through the website.  The CPA for that is between $10 and $100 (I'm not familiar with exactly how it is set).<p>This project took a few thousand dollars of outsourced work plus the equivalent of about three weeks of full time work from myself.  The client and I anticipate that it will be very successful for them.<p>You can do something fairly similar for your startup -- I've never seen one that can't combine engineering expertise plus writing to generate fairly compelling content at scale, and the SEO gains for it are <i>considerable</i>.

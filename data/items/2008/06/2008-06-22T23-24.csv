People are very reluctant (rightfully so) to give up their financial information, so I think it is a good idea to start with an existing service like PayPal or amazon FPS. Next, I would select frameworks based on the development environment you're most familiar with. I might choose java/spring/hibernate/struts2 or even raw jdbc and servlets because I've spent so long in the java world, but many in this community would probably lean towards RoR or similar.

224505,comment,224407,224475,0,0,watmough,,,"I went back and re-read your explanation above, and my constructive criticism would be the following:<p>1. Use a table, or horizontal grid of divs to represent the calendar. You can write different server or client side code to render different presentations, e.g. calendar, 5 day view, 7 day view etc.<p>2. In this grid, tag each div with the appropriate date stamp as appropriate for your application.<p>3. Build code on the client side to track mouse drags, clicks, or whatever you need to provide the user with a great experience specifying start and end times.<p>None of this sounds that hard or tricky, and I would certainly be happier with an approach that separated out generating time tagged divs from the presentation and selection mechanism.",1214178247

224489,comment,224407,224407,0,0,jlouis,,,"You should favor simple, elegant and flexible code. Why? Because it tends to be the code that is the easiest to prove correct. Even if you don't want to prove it correct, that kind of code tends to be easy to read, easy to adapt and easy to change.<p>My preferred measurement is to look at how easy it would be to prove a couple of nontrivial theorems about the code you are looking at. The easier that would be, in a perceived view, the better I find the code. If you kludged 2-3 things of no relation into the same function, it proves to be extremely hard to state meaningful cases in proofs about it.<p>Good code arises with 2 things: Persistence and iteration. It is when you leave code and never come back to improve it that things begin to go wrong. Think about it: All successful source code projects have these two traits. People keep coming back to read old code and improve it. They persistently iterate the code into better shape. Hence, you should favor code that is easy to read and understand. If it is not, then it will be rewritten in the next iteration when someone glances at it. Unless it contains some elegant piece that saves you a lot of the headache -- you will know when you try to rewrite it into ""simpler"" code. The persistence and iteration of old code to better it, is what most bad management do not understand about software construction.",1214177202

Premium messaging only works with a shortcode, so this is necessary.<p>2) Secure a contract with an SMS provider.  I strongly suggest m-Qube, which is now owned by Verisign.  Their service is excellent in every way.  Great APIs, superior uptime and performance, superior support, very competitive rates, excellent relationships with the carriers.<p>3) Draft a 'Program Brief' following the carrier guidelines, that explains your application.  These guidelines are very specific (things like how you offer the ability to opt-out, advertise your tariffs, etc.) and your application must conform to them perfectly before the carriers will approve it.<p>4) Submit the Program Brief for carrier approval.  This process takes between 1 to 3 months depending on the nature of the application, particular carrier, etc.  The approval process may, and often does, include redoing some of your application to suit the carriers.<p>5) Assuming all the carriers approve your Program Brief, you can then start charging users when you send them a response. (sending a message is the only event you can charge a premium tariff for).<p>The carriers each have a specific revenue sharing breakdown that is dependent on volume, price point, etc.  In the case of m-Qube, they also take a small cut.  Negotiating directly with the carriers is another endeavor entirely that I dont have any expertise in.",1214177099

224477,comment,224312,224317,0,0,baha_man,,,"I'm not sure, but I think this effect was mentioned in 'Persuasion' by Robert Cialdini.  It's worth reading if you haven't already. His example was a wine list - the waiter first suggests the cheapest wine, which the customer dismisses out of hand, not wanting to look a cheapskate.  The waiter then suggests a very expensive wine, and the customer nervously asks if he can recommend anything else.  Finally the waiter suggests another wine which is priced between the other two (but perhaps costs more than the customer would originally have wanted to pay) and it seems like a bargain compared with the expensive wine.<p>He also mentions a jewellery store in a tourist resort which started selling more items when they put their prices up.  When the jewellery was cheap, it sent the signal 'this is cheap tat' - when the price was higher, customers started thinking 'this is a quality item' even though the product was the same.<p>Joel Spolsky has also covered this topic, again it's worth reading if you're not already familiar with it:<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckie...</a>",1214176101

When someone resizes the event or moves it, it's going to take some kind of pixel calculations at one point or another, even if they're very generalized, since they used their mouse to do that. This is the point at which I decided to deal with that. Otherwise the events are all handled abstractly. The data isn't necessarily coupled with the presentation, but for example the way they move the event around on the DOM when they're dragging and dropping (presentation) has to be <i></i><i>translated</i><i></i> into data at one point or another (and so the function is called dom2time--translating presentation to data :).",1214175606

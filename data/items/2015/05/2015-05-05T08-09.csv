That&#x27;s something I am trying to change.<p>This is the biggest problem, I think - the conception of UX without &quot;user&quot; work.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean only testing per se, but any kind of empirical or data collection work (from using anthropological methods early to strict usability testing). If a given company is not doing any of this, then they&#x27;re not doing UX at all. If they&#x27;re not in contact with the user in any way, then it&#x27;s not UX.<p>Having someone creating UIs in Photoshop is not UX and this is, I think, the biggest and most detrimental misconception of the field.",1430816378

9491514,comment,9489282,9490324,0,0,codeshaman,,,"It&#x27;s been almost 2 months since I started learning Clojure+ClojureScript.<p>The language itself is beautiful and very powerful, you feel like you&#x27;re gaining new superpowers as you learn it.
You also start to understand your imperative languages much better as you learn Clojure and grasp concepts like functional programming, data (im)mutability, runtime polymorphism and get some new insights into concurrency.
Lisp&#x27;s Code is data and &#x27;data is all you need&#x27; is an extremely powerful concept too.<p>Interactive development is a really cool thing.<p>But the path was not all flowers, I must confess.<p>I&#x27;ve struggled for weeks with the editors and Repl integration (I chose Cursive eventually), setting up the projects and the workflow for clojure, browser and node.js vm.<p>We have a tendency to try and adapt the stuff we learn to the things we already know and sometimes I did just that, trying to fit a square into the circle that I know and it never quite fits. It&#x27;s best if you &#x27;forget&#x27; all your previous programming knowledge and just go with the Clojure/ClojureScript way of doing things. 
The language (and especially the tools/libs) are evolving rapidly so check the date on the articles you read: if earlier than 2014, chances are things are done differently now.
Also, the best way to get help fast is through the IRC channels on freenet. I would have saved days if not weeks if I&#x27;ve figured this out earlier.<p>That being said, ClojureScript is <i>not</i> like CoffeeScript. While it compiles to javascript, there&#x27;s little benefit in using it as a &#x27;javascript dialect&#x27;.  It&#x27;s power is in it&#x27;s ability to be Clojure in the browser and the most benefit is when you have the tandem of clojure server and clojurescript client (which is actually one single application - go figure).<p>You can also feel that clojure is on the rise right now - there&#x27;s stuff appearing every day - articles, books, libraries and cool demos, I think programmers are just starting to grasp the true power of the 21st century lisp. It kind of feels like the early days of node.js, so things will definitely grow in the future.",1430816118

We&#x27;re stuffing computers into phones, refrigerators, toasters, security cameras, set-top boxes, and fnord knows what else. A gumstick is sufficient to serve personal content.<p>The costs come elsewhere. You need a stable Net connection (pretty easy to come by). Distributed data means that any single system loss is pretty much a non-event. Abuse and bad behavior are far bigger issues, all the usual suspects: child pr0n, adult pr0n, copyright violations, threats and bullying. Policing those on a fully-distributed infrastructure would be a nightmare (maybe we&#x27;ll just give up that fight).<p>Identity and credential recovery are actually pretty big issues. I could see a market where these are actually turned to a benefit, through localized service provision. A local business or enterprise with an interest in knowing who you are and/or establishing your identity might take on the task of maintaining base nodes. It would depend on costs and benefits. Retail, banking, insurance, healthcare, comms provider or other local institutions. Possibly education or government (there are those of us whose first Internet experience came by way of college or university, though we&#x27;re starting to die out). And as I&#x27;ve observed elsewhere, &quot;Who are you&quot; is becoming the most expensive question online.<p>Craigslist comes to mind. A <i>very</i> small segment of activity funds a great deal else on the site, including a pretty extensive forums section (though that&#x27;s got various issues).<p>The biggest cost is almost certainly direct customer interaction. Convert this to a model where that&#x27;s already happening or can be converted to a benefit, and you may well have a win.<p>That $12-$15/mo isn&#x27;t what you need someone to _pay_ you directly for the service, but what you need to be able to recover from them, net.

9491487,comment,9487881,9487881,0,0,fberg,,,"While this book is an interesting and fairly comprehensive book on functional programming and music theory, I have the impression that the idea of algorithmic composition as expressed in this book is out of fashion now. Algorithmic composition was big in contemporary, &quot;serious&quot; music in the last part of the 20th century, but my contemporary composer friends seem to have left their Markov chains and Lisp algorithms and are now more into interactive stuff, with Processing and Arduino being a couple of the technologies du jour. It&#x27;s not a clear-cut distinction, you can of course use Haskell and FP for interactive music creation and there will be various degrees of algorithmic composing in an interactive, computer based performance. But the possibilities of pure, computer generated music have largely been explored, decomposed down to sample-level granularity and recomposed using all thinkable sound generating algorithms. The cultural impact has been somewhere between weak and zero. People still prefer tonal music composed by humans.<p>I believe algorithmic composition has suffered the same fate as symbolic natural language processing. They are both interesting from an academic point of view, but have failed to produce the wanted end results. Computers have not given us new musical dimensions that anyone outside an academic, postmodernist following care to listen to. The hope (or threat, depending of how you view it) may lie in statistical approaches. Thorough statistical analyses of existing compositions and recomposition based on that, parallelling what Google translate does with natural language processing. As far as I know, there are companies and researchers working on that, so don&#x27;t throw away those Markov chains yet.",1430815780

You then have to make sure everyone adheres to this, if possible by using automated tools. As a startup, you often don&#x27;t have the luxury to be able to invest in that kind of infrastructure. You have to train people to use the language correctly, which is a huge time sink. Onboarding still is a huge problem.<p>Backwards compatibility is another big factor that has bitten people once too often. Compiler bugs, slow compile times, bad community attitude come on top of this.<p>>> If people start off thinking of Scala as simply a &quot;better Java&quot;, and only move to use its easier-to-understand features, I think it&#x27;d be a lot easier to hire people to work on Scala codebases and/or train people in the language.<p>Yes absolutely, and I agree it can be used effectively in that case.

(Here in my country, people literally sell shit for money. Elk shit, to be exact. Apparently, many Germans want to have it in their homes.)<p>But let&#x27;s say you come to this wonderful small gelateria in an Italian village. The ice cream is amazing. The setting is amazing. Your experience is breathtaking. Naturally, since we&#x27;re all entrepreneurs here and all that jazz, you think &quot;I wonder if there&#x27;s not a commercial value in this&quot;. So you start making some kind of ice cream cones or whatever. You make advertising which creates a longing for that experience, that we all kind of know (perhaps even from my few faltering words) of Italian ice cream on a trattoria somewhere in Tuscany. You sell the ice cream to people.<p>Now, did you expose more people to that original gelateria? No, you didn&#x27;t! You sold them on the idea, and they got some pretty boring ice cream to eat in their pretty boring home. And you got the money.<p>That&#x27;s an approximation of what I&#x27;m afraid might happen if you succeeded in convincing the creator to &quot;monetize&quot;. But it&#x27;s ok, you won&#x27;t do that; first off, he&#x27;s not here and what&#x27;s more he&#x27;s obviously got enough talent to make whatever money he wants to, should he so decide.<p>Edit: In my original reply, I didn&#x27;t mean &quot;train&quot;.

Continues through various naval encounters during the Napoleonic wars, and into attacks on german-held Norwegian territories during WW2 - ending with 1st Airborne landing at Oslo and Stavenger.<p>While very few of these are actually actions against Norway, they are on what is today Norwegian soil, which is the general theme of the book.<p>Chile is similar, in that while there&#x27;s very little against Chile as a nation, there&#x27;s plenty of attacks against the Spanish territory that became Chile, starting with the sacking of Valparaiso in 1578, and ending with british fighting with chile to establish their independence from Spain.<p>The general theme of the book isn&#x27;t &quot;we&#x27;ve attacked every country on this list&quot; - it&#x27;s more that if you put a pin on the map for every british military action listed through the book, a good 90% of today&#x27;s countries will find a pin within their territory.",1430814671

9491392,comment,9488532,9489912,0,0,pdkl95,,,"Nothing in the DOM spec indicates that there are scroll bars or anything else about how the user is interacting with the scrolling position of the page. The window.scroll* functions talk about pixel or line dimensions, and not how the user&#x27;s scrolling interface works or how the user interacts with that interface.<p>For example, some common methods are:<p><pre><code>    * scrolling with a mouse by clicking on a traditional scrollbar
      (this is what is being reimplemented)
    * using a scroll wheel or trackpad drag
      (compatibility is *often* added for this, but not always)
    * dragging touchscreen    (support varies, getting better)
    * using the arrow keys    (sometimes supported)
</code></pre>
..and a few of that almost always break when scrolling isn&#x27;t left to the user agent:<p><pre><code>    * PageUp/PageDn
    * some other key to page down, such as the space bar
    * a browser extension to auto-scroll the page slowly
    * accessibility tools of various types
    * no javascript support
    * the foot pedal I made out of MIDI keyboard sustain pedals and an
      old USB keyboard that is mapped to a non-standard X KeySym and
      bound as an alias to PageDn in firefox (it&#x27;s Meta in emacs)
    * the scrolling UI for next year&#x27;s Cool New Gadget that we cannot
      support because the device doesn&#x27;t exist yet, but the manufacturers
      of the device can add support for standard HTML/DOM features
</code></pre>
Also, even in the case where the UI <i>method</i> is guess correctly, the details may be different. For example, I set firefox&#x27;s mousewheel.default.delta_multiplier_y to 500 so each scroll wheel click is a much larger movement of the page, because my mouse wheel is not a mouse wheel - I use thumb buttons for scrolling because the normal wheel was causing RSI problems.<p>The basic problem is a common misconception about what HTML, where the client (via their User Agent) controls the presentation. As they are in the hands of the <i>users</i>, there will always be a lot of variation as those users tailor their tools to their personal needs. The only way to maintain any particular presentation feature across all clients is to turn the WWW back into TV. The alternative is learning what can be specified by the page (pixel scroll position) and what is NOT in the spec (how the user and their User Agent interact), while remembering that any of these features may not be implemented the way you think they are.",1430813434

I am aware of the programmer&#x27;s urge to <i>over-optimize &quot;all the things&quot;</i> for the million requests per second. I think I get that many times.<p>My issue is that, while learning, you want to make the best choice when it comes to the users data. My take is if <i>one</i> does not full understand a component of the stack, <i>one</i> takes precautions. For example, I might not be the best on setting up a couple of mysql servers doing replication and monitoring the whole lot. However, what one can do is use a service like RDS, where it takes backups for you, and you can restore, or spin up a new instances etc etc. Which is nice.<p>Having switched to Mongo a while ago (using Compose), I feel that I don&#x27;t have that much of control.

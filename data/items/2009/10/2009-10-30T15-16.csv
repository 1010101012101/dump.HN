912214,comment,911170,912109,0,0,amalcon,,,"Interestingly, ""smart"" is only equated with memorization in artificial situations (like academics and trivia shows).  Case in point:  if you ask people who's presently the smartest person in America, they might say the jeopardy guy (I actually suspect a lot of them would say Hawking).  If you ask who's the smartest person in American history, the overwhelming response will probably be Einstein (except a few who will say Hawking, or -- very rarely -- Tesla).  Einstein was a notorious problem-solver.  Certainly, if you asked someone if they'd prefer their child to grow up to be like Einstein or like the Jeopardy guy, they'd probably pick Einstein.<p>Likewise, I don't think the author was implying any sort of conspiracy.  I probably used the wrong word.  I should have said that there's no real effort on anyone's part to promote memorization over problem-solving.  Memorization is more prominent in these artificial situations because it's easier to train and test, rather than because people think it's superior.",1256917859

Sprint has major problems from the lowest levels of customer support all the way up to management (Nextel merger?) Apple would have to gut the entire company. Sprint has no presence outside of the US so Apple would still have to deal with carriers and would still have to produce a GSM/LTE iPhone. Verizon has already committed heavily to LTE and AT&T is leaning in the same direction. Unless AT&T has a change of heart WiMax is going to be doomed in the US.<p>It would however make sense for Apple to cut a deal with Sprint. Sprint roams on Verizon's network so if Apple were to produce a CDMA iPhone exclusively for Sprint they could sneak into Verizon's network through the backdoor. Sprint is desperate so they probably would accept almost any terms from Apple. Sprint's monthly package costs are more reasonable than both AT&T and Verizon and this would attract a whole new market to the iPhone. Additionally Apple could offer the same CDMA model unlocked, unsubsidized, for use on Verizon's network. (if Verizon didn't want to make a deal)",1256916458

912130,comment,909449,909636,0,0,xiaoma,,,"What is this ""decline"" in traditional Chinese characters you're talking about?  Unlike the PRC, Taiwan and HK both have universal literacy.  Residents of Taiwan in particular are amongst the most voracious readers on the planet.  According to one study I read, only the Japanese are reading more.  Not only that, but mainlanders are now increasingly familiar with traditional characters, due to the influx of HK/TW music videos and movies.  The opposite is not true... not even in HK.<p>Whatever the reasons you have for disliking traditional characters, it's important to recognize that the simplification process involved a trade-off.  Characters became faster to write by hand, somewhat more phonetic (for Mandarin speakers), but recognizability was sacrificed to a degree as was semantic information (e.g. swapping the 燕 out of 嚥 and slapping in an 因).<p>In reading, the important thing is how distinct a character is from another, not how <i>simple</i> it is.<p>Look at these character pairs (traditional/simplified)<p><pre><code>    義 vs. 叉    /    义 vs. 叉

    無 vs. 天    /    无 vs. 天

    廣 vs. 廠    /    广 vs. 厂

    術 vs. 木    /    术 vs. 木
</code></pre>
When it comes to hand-writing, which isn't nearly as important as it was in the past, most people do use some simplifications for speed.  Most aren't as extreme as the PRC simplifications were, though.  In truth, simplification still hasn't met its original proponents' goals of promoting widespread literacy, while the areas using traditional characters achieved those goals without changing their writing system.<p>The Taiwanese Americans you were speaking to were almost certainly aware of all of the above, but they might have been too polite or just too off-guard to point it out.",1256915623

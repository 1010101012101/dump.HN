If that motion is granted, which is reasonably likely (though never certain), it will be time for Apple to clarify what support and coverage it gives to the sued app developers.<p>I know from at least one of them that he is NOT covered by Apple. If that continues to be the situation, the advice may unfortunately have to be at some point to sign Lodsys's license agreement if that results in dismissal from the lawsuit or helps avoid one.<p>For Android developers, the question is what Google will do. So far they say nothing and do nothing. If Apple's motion is granted, the question must be asked why Google doesn't intervene. One of the accused apps is an Android app (""Labyrinth for Android""). If Google doesn't protect Android app developers, they will also have to consider very seriously a license deal with Lodsys.<p>I have seen Lodsys's license agreement. I would recommend that many app developers share the cost of having it reviewed by a lawyer (rather than get into Patrick Igoe's claim chart stuff, which is neither convincing nor useful to those who can't afford a multi-million-dollar lawsuit over that question). If a lawyer agrees that the license agreement is reasonable, which in my personal opinion it is, then that's definitely better than going to court.<p>Patrick Igoe also came up with a ""divided infringement"" theory, which I rebutted on my blog. Apple apparently doesn't believe in his theory either, so why should you?",1308124530

2656300,comment,2656218,2656282,4,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I sympathize with you as much as anyone can who's not in your exact situation. The new law stinks, and unfortunately, a lot of finance-related startups aren't affected by it because they've already come up with workarounds for this kind of thing. (BankSimple, for example, just provides a software interface; funds are managed through a regular banking institution.)<p>However, I'd like to second the notion of taking your ball and going elsewhere, even if it means opening up some kind of satellite office. Why not another country? Chile, for example, has been getting lots of press lately for being startup friendly. They'd probably love to have your product down there. Yes, it's a smaller, more limited market, but so what? You'd have the opportunity to get in to an untapped market with a product that already works. You could keep pumping the product into the U.S. press in the meantime with an angle that editors will love to run because it'll sell copies faster than hotcakes: U.S. innovation is moving to other countries because of stifling laws. (Regardless of your opinion of that point of view, the fact is that it's one that sells magazines and other print publications right now.)<p>In all seriousness, in your situation, it's what I'd do. In Go parlance, right now you're trying to defend from a weak position. Give up that territory now, before you're any more invested in it, and focus on building a strong position elsewhere on the board, and then attacking from there.<p>And you could still continue U.S. operations on other products and projects. You, personally, wouldn't need to relocate. With your track record, you'd be a shoe-in for Startup Chile, which would mean you'd get access to a small amount of capital ($40k IIRC) and all kinds of help during their next application round.<p>As far as the Valley goes -- well, fuck 'em. The scene in the Valley is entirely self-interested; if its revenues aren't directly affected by something, it just doesn't care.<p>Getting pissed off at the situation, while certainly understandable, won't help you to think more clearly about it.

When people say stuff you disagree with that is <i>true</i> you can't call it FUD. Your claim ""Oil and business lobby groups are undoubtedly better organized and better funded than most everyone else"" is pretty clearly false if the amounts featured at exxonsecrets are any indication; they're a pittance compared to the funding the alarmist groups get. Like, that Cato page (again) says Cato got $125k <i>since 1998</i>, which averages out to roughly $10k/year. There are only a couple groups on the list getting the kind of funding that could even <i>plausibly</i> affect their agenda; all the others are just on the list for rhetorical value. Like, Group X said something we don't like once or hosted a lecture by somebody we don't like and Exxon gave them a $5k grant once, so we're going to connect the dots and claim nefarious motives.<p>Again, rather than do a point-by-point, I'm just going to pick one. You hilite that CEI wrote an article titled ""Liberal 'Scientists' Lead Jihad Against Global-Warming Skeptics"". Yeah, the title sounds sensationalist - titles often do that, but get over the title and actually read the damn article. It turns out to mostly be a debunking of...the effort that produced the exxonsecrets site! Here's the article:<p><a href=""http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=20573"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=20573</a><p>Quote:<p>====<p><i>In 2006, UCS decided to attack ExxonMobil, the worlds largest private energy company, over the issue of global warming. It also decided on its tactics: It would demonize the oil company by comparing it to cigarette companies. ExxonMobil, said UCS, was adopt[ing] the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics ... to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue.<p>In a paper issued Jan. 3, 2007, UCS accuses ExxonMobil of funding front groups opposed to the climate-alarmist agenda of groups such as UCS and of former Vice President Al Gore. The company, said the UCS report, had distributed $16 million to 43 advocacy groups from 1998 to 2005 to confuse the public on global-warming science.\nLets leave aside the fact that $16 million over eight years cant match the $2 billion that the federally funded Climate Change Science Program spends each year on global warming, or even the $4 million annual budget of just one of the many well-funded global-warming advocacy groups, Strategies for the Global Environment (the umbrella organization for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change).[...]</i><p><i>UCS doesnt focus its attacks on the actual work produced by the organizations it targets. Instead, it tries to discredit its opponents by using ad hominem innuendo. And thats what gets the attention of the media. For instance, when astrophysicist Sallie Baliunas determined that the Earths temperature had actually been warmer at earlier times in history -- a premise endorsed by a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel -- UCS ignored the research but attacked the researcher personally, noting that Baliunas was affiliated with the George C. Marshall Institute, which UCS said had received $630,000 in ExxonMobil grants for its climate-science program.</i><p>=====<p>>And there looks to be about 150 of such organizations, with employees working all day, every day, to make sure that their organization continues to receive funding from businesses to whom a carbon tax is a major threat.<p>Ahem. One of those organization is a <i>university</i> that gets occasional $5k grants. $5k probably gets a nice thank you letter but does not get you employees ""working all day, every day"" to make your interest theirs. Another dozen random links I clicked were to organizations for whom the documented contribution of Exxon is $0. If you think there are 150 organizations on that list that are <i>heavily influenced by</i> Exxon, you've been snookered by a PR effort.",1308122313

Firstly, controlling access to continuations makes sense, since they can be a world of woe.  Second, continuations alone don't give you any parallelism: that CPS helps you understand the goroutines does not mean that the semantics of goroutines can be understood purely in terms of continuations.<p>See Shivers, 1997, Continuations and threads: Expressing machine concurrency directly in advanced languages (postscript), <a href=""http://www.ccis.neu.edu/home/shivers/papers/cps-threads.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccis.neu.edu/home/shivers/papers/cps-threads.ps</a>",1308122105

Unilateral.<p>Better would be to think about an internationally accepted (within the UN framework) mechanism to deal with these attacks. Define what is permissible and what is ""over the line"". Then define required actions and accepted sanctions when an attack occures.<p>Governments will always blame it on some ""hackers"". But a mechanism could define how a government MUST procede when a grave attack is carried out from within its territory. Maybe it MUST accept that law enforcement of the target nation has the right to check equipment used in the offending nation.<p>Overall, such an international mechanism should be set up to make it more difficult to sneakily carry our those attacks and hide behind some ""hackers"" accusation.<p>However, I doubt that the US would be willing to submit to such a mechanism. Because I believe they would be sitting more often on the offending site than on the target site. Until now, the US has not even submitted to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and similar important mechanisms to stop and procecute attrocities against humanity committed during war. The US knows very well why they don't submit to such a court, of course. Same would most likely be the case for any international mechanism against government cyber crimes.",1308121536

A last-minute rule change in the auction declared that licenses would be granted on a first-come, first-served basis to anyone with completed paperwork and $355 million in cash.

A proper auction will end up selling spectrum to those rentiers who expect to get the most profits from the spectrum out of the public, and (likely) can convince banks etc. to borrow enough to buy it. That in turn will set a cost floor, and winners of the auction aren't able to reduce prices below the cost of the capital. But by selling the spectrum cheaply, telecommunication benefits have potential to be spread more widely, because the cost floor is lower.",1308121234

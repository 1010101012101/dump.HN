There have certainly been several interesting articles on clojure performance, and work done to improve performance for native data structures (transients). I, and no doubt many others, would be genuinely interested in performance studies on more complex concurrency problems I've seen so far.",1256865284

The industry we operate in is very narrow and while losing thus customer alone would hurt us a lot, having someone there say negative things about us could destroy us. I have already written off this customer, because if nothing else, the stress of having to manage a corrupt person while not indulging in corruption is not worth whatever money we make off them. But we would prefer to not get vilified in the industry because of someone else's character flaws.<p>I will find out about how to anonymously report this. I am thinking I could do it at least after a few months so at the very least it's not obvious who did it.",1256865219

This seems (based on my University education) to be increasingly true even in disciplines like Math and CS.<p>Beginning in grade school, the ""smart kids"" are those who memorize things, not those who solve problems. I'm better at rote memorization, but I pride myself on solving problems.",1256865177

Hot girls don't go for male hyper feminists. He's simply a confident male who has figured out that making smart girls happy (thru fun comic strips starring smart girls) tends to get him laid. In this he is no different from any man who tells a gal a joke to help her relax.<p>Criticizing a wildly popular work of art known for weaving complicated math and science topics into quality jokes is dangerous to begin with. There is so much danger that the reason you don't ""get it"" is because its over your head and you don't know it. To then express the criticism with such poorly-written captions is just sad.<p>XKCD forever.",1256865140

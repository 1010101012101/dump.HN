684026,comment,683807,683989,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"""Object oriented models are fine if you write one application. But they tie functionality to data very closely and that makes repurposing of data for seperate applications much more difficult. So how do they analyse their data or use it in more than one application?""<p>This was an extremely poorly-written and poorly-researched article. One problem is that the projects being discussed are not object databases in the sense of storing straight-up serialized representations of business objects.<p>Take CouchDB for example; the basic ""thing"" you store in it and get back from it is a JSON object, which is a set of key/value pairs. In this sense it's not too far removed from SQL-based DBs, because you still choose which bits of data you're going to store (the keys in the object). It departs from the SQL point of view in not requiring that all the records have the same schema, and in not having a representation (at the data-storage level) of relations between records.<p>This turns out to offer some big advantages: in my experience, the number-one cause of unwieldy SQL is a schema that's had to grow over time to accomodate ever more edge cases. Maybe it's been done through lots of nullable columns, maybe it's been done through lots of related tables or some other mechanism, but it frequently has to be done and ends up making the database painful to work with.<p>CouchDB throws that out the window: edge-case records simply go in like anything else, and if they don't have some particular field present in other records, so what? The ""query"" is actually hitting a map/reduce in which the ""map"" function can take whatever action it wants with a record that's missing some particular key. It can skip that record, it can spit out a default value for a missing key, it can do anything it likes.<p>""I'm convinced that data has a different life cycle than procedural code and therefore needs to be expressed in a simple, uniform, reductionist model independent of all application code.""<p>Simple and independent, yes. Reductionist and uniform, no.<p>To run with CouchDB as the example, those assumptions are thrown out because CouchDB essentially adds a layer to the stack. Traditionally, you have application code over <i>here</i>, querying data over <i>there</i>. In CouchDB, you have application code which queries a CouchDB view which returns data, but the query doesn't necessarily know anything at all about what the actual data in the DB is, or how it's structured (or even if it <i>is</i> structured in any sensible way; maybe it's just a bunch of random key/value pairs). The view layer is the part which cares about that.<p>And views are not static (or mostly static) things like the schemas in relational DBs; views are free to evolve over time, you're free to add or remove views in response to changing needs, and <i>the underlying data never has to change as a result</i>. And so you don't need to agonize over the most efficient way to reduce your data to a uniform schema. You don't need to ""migrate"" your underlying data storage representation to change the types of things you can store or the types of queries you can run.",1246521275

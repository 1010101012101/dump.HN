83187,comment,82949,83136,0,0,nkohari,,,"I live in Northeast Ohio. My major concern is that if I try to shop around my business plan in my area, investors won't understand half of what I'm talking about. I'm not speaking from experience, mind you, but the area is not exactly a powerhouse for Internet companies. The VC firms around here are attenuated towards other industries, like biotechnology and polymers. I'm pretty sure it would be tough to convince them to invest in a 25 year old's web startup when they're used to investing in companies that have patent-protected manufacturing processes and $10 million in sales.",1195911961

That means you're roughly as beholden to investors no matter where you are.  And stupid as many SV investors are, they are on average smarter than those outside it.",1195910359

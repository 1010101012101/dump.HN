A skilled immigrant can get a permanent residency visa in 1-3 years, whereas a grandparent might need 5-10 years. In the US, the quota system is disproportionately biased in favor of relatives - something like 70% of all immigrants. The only path for skilled immigrants is H1-B, which has an annual cap of 65,000 visas.<p>For example, Canada issued about 250,000 PR visas last year. 150,000 went to skilled workers and entrepreneurs, whereas only 65,000 went to family members.

Your reply reminds me of a thread I read on the arocket list, discussing the rationale behind the new Ares program.<p>The most interesting thing about it, to me, was that the engineers from the private sector just couldn't seem to understand the political constraints that the government managers work under.<p>I've only ever worked at small to medium-sized private-sector software companies. It's fascinating to get a look into public institutions and the way civil-servants make decisions.<p>As a hacker, there's a real danger of only considering engineering constraints, and dismissing organizational or political constraints on a problem or program. I often see bright techies make suggestions that are just naive from a political or organizational perspective. Suggesting a plan that would work great ""if only the government weren't so clueless or corrupt"" is no plan at all, if you actually have to work with the government.<p>This is not a direct criticism of pg's essay.

Perhaps when Wine reaches parity with Windows (and I can see that time coming), but even if that particular hurdle is overcome, from a usability perspective it's going to take a big effort for GNOME to reach parity with Windows, let alone manage to make enough commercial impact to overcome the familiarity that the average Windows user has. Hell, even in terms of system administration, managing a set of Windows machines is supposed to be much easier than a set of Linux machines. Perhaps the difference is we're going to have a time where people choose Windows instead of having Windows as the only choice, and that's a positive step forward.<p>Oh, and while Microsoft would rather have people paying for Vista licenses, XP licenses still means money in their pocket as well. We're still at a time when they're primarily competing with themselves. If people use Windows 7 for a decade, they're still getting the license fees on basically every PC unit sold.",1239484810

By which I mean not that it has to make something physical, but that it has to have one thing it sells to many people, rather than doing custom work for individual clients.</i><p>Open source is inherently not a product -- at least, not in the sense of being something you can sell to many people.  The frequent cry of ""but we'll make money selling support"" ignores a critical fact: There aren't enough hours in the day to get rich by selling support contracts.<p>The one ""open source"" company which was successful at making lots of money -- MySQL -- wasn't in fact an open source company: They made their money selling a commercial product, and they just happened to use releasing a GPLed version as a cheap advertising mechanism.<p>I strongly support open source software; but a startup which builds open source software?  It ain't a startup.",1212854364

211554,comment,211294,211467,0,0,hhm,,,"Thanks for your advice; I've been raising rates for development but what I'm afraid, is that sometimes I'm very busy with projects for months, and then I just can't work in other projects... And if other clients ask for development at that time I just can't offer them it then. I'm afraid of slowly losing those clients, of course (that's why now I only ""offer"" consultancy, because then I don't break any clients' expectatives, and now and then I just start development for some months, in a project for some of those clients).",1212853855
211553,comment,201373,201373,0,0,slakinduff,,,"1) I have found it impossible to establish relationships with others (seemingly like myself) online. It plain does not work. I'm not sure why... it just won't go. It doesn't make any difference how much you have in common or what your accomplishments are. Try and drum up a discussion or introduce yourself cold to someone in SV or at MIT or anywhere else, on say, LinkedIn. You're a nut, an intruder. I doubt this will ever work.
2) There is an chasm separating intellectualism and ambition that is difficult to understand. When I read Bill and Dave, I was taken back by the ambition of early Stanford engineering faculty. But today? I know too many at universities with stunning intelligence, but still have that profit-is-evil and corporations-are-bad crap from the 70's. It's like some weird religion. Talk about ideas and that's fine, but AS SOON AS YOU MENTION ACTION, it gets ugly and they shut down. That's why most MIT grads still work for Harvard grads. It's too bad, but this is why Cambridge will likely never become some kind of SV.
3) The power and action in SV you describe, is cold and lifeless and without meaning. Maybe exciting like a thrill park, but meaningless. That's why startup successes leave the founders in a panic to hitch the next ride, fast. What you say about the message in SV is true, but if your ambition was to take action and do a startup because you wanted to do something with meaning, better go somewhere else because in SV meaning has no meaning. No one cares about meaning. Ideas are nothing more than pancakes - flip 'em until their brown on both sides. And so in this regard, the message in SV may very well be EXACTLY like that in New York, with the only difference being that value is attached to the means by which the wealth is gained - independently. Have you thought about that??? That in SV all they care about is money like in New York, but gaining the wealth by independent means is what matters. You could test this - offer to help someone free of charge. See how much they despise feeling indebted to someone else, however slight. It's just a theory.",1212853849

I just think it's good to know who lives on my street, and the folks I don't know are the ones who drive in and out of the garage in the SUV and never say hello.  It's their right to do so, but I think it weakens the community.",1212852005

808922,comment,806176,806550,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"So, the API of these auto clean up objects is high level. Now how high level is the implementation? If you wrote it yourself (you sound like you did), and the abstraction has few or no leak, I bet you had to write insanely low level code to achieve that.<p>I see only one reason to do that: you need performance so high that no garbage collected language could provide it; and the application is so complex that you have to write high level APIs. Not to mention that your application has to be basically bottleneck-free, or you would have used a garbage collected language, it's FFI, and C/Fortran for the tight loops.<p>To my eyes, that is a tiny niche. It may even be void. The ""pure low level"" and ""pure high level"" niches are both better filled by simpler languages. The ""low <i>and</i> high level with bottlenecks"" niche can be filled by a combo (a combo is simpler than C++, in my opinion).<p>Now, there is a huge niche best filled by C++: the use and maintenance of C++ programs. This is my current day job.",1252318923

However, it doesn't work when the company has multiple revenue streams and doesn't break them out in their published accounts. In that case, if the company runs separate sites for each revenue stream, you can use Alexa (or similar) to get an idea of the traffic percentage to that sub-site and use it as a crude proxy for revenue.",1252318899

808911,comment,808830,808830,0,0,halo,,,"I'm not convinced this is a particularly useful exercise because most changes are the evolution of what came before. You're trying to create a neat package of discrete changes when the real world is continuous and evolutionary.<p>Take ""Internet search will be an extremely important and profitable business"", for example. But Yahoo and AltaVista were both important and profitable before Google even existed, and their existence is because of the web's lack of built-in search, which was a design decision, for example. If you'd told me 15 years ago that the most popular and profitable website in the world was a search engine making money through delivering ads, I wouldn't have been particularly surprised.",1252318254

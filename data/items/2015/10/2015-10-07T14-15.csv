Because it read like an undifferentiated rant against all typography.<p>If it was only about kerning, why did you set up a huge strawman about monospaced fonts implying that you would by fine in a world with only monospaced fonts, and that readability is not really a thing, and then going on to set up some analogy about relationships that is utterly unfathomable in its irrelevance.

I used one for my own company.<p>Like a domain registration they also usually provide anonymity by declaring themselves as your office address. That&#x27;s legitimate too as many contractors don&#x27;t have an office and don&#x27;t want thier home address published publicly on the uk companies register. That isn&#x27;t a fraud.<p>The BBC makes much of the weird ownership structure, but it is not that crazy. The structure described, 2 companies that basically represent people owning a company that basically does work is a tax efficiency. If the co owners own it directly and take thier money as pay not dividend, they pay more tax. If they take it as dividend not pay, it is split by ownership not hours worked. Better for both directors to be companies that charge the main company per hour for work done and then extract the dividend from those personal company seperately. I wouldn&#x27;t do it as it has some problems like disguised employment but if compliant it is a tax efficiency not an evasion, and not a criminal activity.<p>I dunno, it&#x27;s like saying a secure document destruction company is suspicious. It&#x27;s just a company that provides a service that most users need to do normal productive business.",1444229807

Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> Our team is distributed around the world. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at our largest office in Brooklyn, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386...</a>",1444229420

So its sort of a good thing to give the doctor as much info as possible but this rarely happens as pharma sales person Barbie and Ken could care less.<p>Pharma sales have strict compliance but guess who enforces those compliances? The pharma companies. Not the FDA. So guess what they use the compliance issues for... to get rid of older employees or to screw over other companies (ie tattle telling).<p>Its completely fucked up.",1444229389

The involvement of &quot;Moldovan forces&quot; came much later, because when the first incidents happened Moldova did not had an army but only a police force which definitely did not had the competence to perform large scale drills like separation of a (newly declared) country in halves! The first causalities were the Moldovan policemen in a Tiraspol police post. I don&#x27;t know where you get your sources from, a reference would have been welcomed.<p>&quot;As far as I know the &#x27;necessary natural preconditions&#x27; for bloodshed are fairly low you just need a couple groups angry at each other and some guns on one or both sides and the lack of an inhibiting leviathan. That certainly existed in Transnistria without Russian involvement.&quot;<p>If you go that far consider that loosely controlled armed groups existed all over Russia itself and nowhere it was treated as possible cause for genocide or whatnot. The preconditions that I was referring to is the base (usually ideological in nature) on which an irreconcilable dispute can grow. This wasn&#x27;t the case in Moldova because Moldovan authorities were very open to peacefully address the kind of issues that Russia claims were central in the Transnistrian conflict. Just look at the Gagauzian Autonomy and take it as a reference for settling a minority related issue without the involvement of russian tanks!",1444228867

The proximate cause for thinking about this was the second edition of the book came out yesterday, and I&#x27;m in a reflective mood.<p>I&#x27;m extremely grateful for being part of this community.

The more sites use the same public CDN, the more users benefit. But if a user doesn&#x27;t have the file already, it&#x27;s a loss. So, tradeoffs.<p>On caching- if you make one JS file and one CSS file for each page, then there is no caching between pages but only necessary info is downloaded for each page. You could make one JS/CSS file for your whole site, but then there are unused assets on each page, and it becomes more difficult to simplify CSS and could increase layout thrashing.

10346058,comment,10339175,10339175,0,0,zaroth,,,"As a client-side hashing approach, I think it&#x27;s a bit overly complicated but probably not fundamentally flawed. I would use a singular hash function to produce the byte stream, instead of introducing a PRNG and seeding it from the hash functoin just to get a byte stream. But the bigger conversation is, what role can client-side hashing play, either as a full-on replacement to server-side hashing, or perhaps just to augment the server-side hashing everyone is doing today?<p>Stepping back a minute, it&#x27;s helpful to consider the fundamental reality of almost any password validation scheme. In this case we are storing a &quot;public key&quot; on the server, but it is more aptly described as the &quot;password validator&quot;. Almost all designs will have such a thing (a notable exception is PolyPassHash which cleverly avoids a one-to-one mapping of users to validators, and uses this to try to defeat some offline attacks, with some interesting trade-offs).<p>If you combine public information, the password validator, and the correct password, your &#x27;password validation function&#x27; will complete and return 1. Therefore, if you have the necessary public information (i.e. domain name, username, whatever else is stuffed in the hash) and you steal the password validator database, you now have everything you need in order to run the so-called &quot;offline dictionary attack&quot;.<p>In SRP, an obvious inspiration to this CBCrypt design, the password validator database is basically computed entirely by the modexp() work required to generate the pub/priv keys. There is no additional/configurable key stretching which can be applied other than choosing the bitlength of the keys.<p>Here we have a configurable round of hashing (Scrypt or PBKDF2) which is applied before the key derivation step. This provides additional protection against offline attacks, depending on how hard the work factor is set. History has shown us, a key detail in ensuring secure password storage is actively managing the hashing function and work factors over time, or else watching Moore&#x27;s law strip away any protection we thought we had.... So the next key question is, how do we actively manage and maintain a sufficient work factor?<p>When evaluating a hashing function, one key question to ask is can we add to the work-factor of existing passwords offline (without having the password in RAM) or do we need the user&#x27;s password resident (somewhere, client or server-side) in order to recompute a new hash with the new work factor? In this case, by design it&#x27;s impossible to offline harden the existing passwords. You would need to first login the user, verify their password, and then recompute a new hash (perhaps transparently, perhaps with some UI component if it is too slow otherwise) and re-derive and update the key server-side, in order to change the work factor.<p>But really, the primary consideration with any client-side hashing design, is how to support the extremely wide array of devices which will need to register/login to your site, and what&#x27;s the user experience when they click the Login button?<p>From CBcrypt.cs, where the proof of concept is written in C#.NET using BouncyCastle&#x27;s Scrypt library:<p><pre><code>   /* cost 4096, blockSize 8, parallel 1, cause SCrypt to take ~175-350ms on Core i5-540M, 2.5Ghz
    * This is in addition to the approx 100ms-200ms to generate ECDSA keypair.
    */
</code></pre>
Now, in reality we are going to be running Scrypt in Javascript on a mobile device. I found what seems to be a highly optimized implementation [1] and plugged it on Dropbox [2] so I could point my browser at it to see how slow just the Scrypt ran. On my laptop it was taking about 800ms and on my iPhone 5 about 2500ms. I would say that means for about 25% of the mobile population this function runs about an order of magnitude too slow for comfort... it will impact user experience, it could impact bounce rate, etc. This doesn&#x27;t even include the ECDH part of the calculation.<p>This is definitely the hardest question to answer with client-side hashing, or even simply &quot;sever-relief&quot; hashing where a portion of the overall hashing may <i>optionally</i> be pushed to the client, particularly during DDoS type events. How do you identify which clients are sufficiently powered to reasonably perform the hashing, or what kind of UI needs to be presented if you could be potentially locking up a browser for 5+ seconds while the hashing is running? Users are not well trained to expect logins to be slow -- a stall in the browser is almost always a reason to simply resubmit the form. It would be great if users associated their browser tab locking up, their fans spinning to full speed, and their battery power plummeting with &quot;Whoohoo, this site is ROCKING a awesome work factor!&quot; but in the real world we see that companies want hashing run on powerful CPUs server-side, with the capability to offline-upgrade hashes over time.<p>The final nail in any client-side hashing approach is when the claims start to cross over to &quot;server never sees the password&quot;. I don&#x27;t see this as a valid argument any time the code to perform the hashing is being sent over the same trusted connection from the server itself. There are corner cases, for example if you are shipping compiled and signed code which is hashing client-side, or if you take special precautions with browser plugins to ensure you are running a specific build of the Javascript, but that simply doesn&#x27;t apply to 99.99% of use cases, and so I personal dismiss those benefits as not likely to be achieved in the real-world. What we&#x27;re left with is technically a sub-optimal user experience with additional trade-offs. So in conclusion, I am currently quite bearish on client-side hashing on the web in general.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://github.com/tonyg/js-scrypt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tonyg/js-scrypt</a>

I guess it is a spectrum but I still feel that if someone asks me to do something that I&#x27;m being a nice person if I do it, I guess others might be devoid of that. So if invited to do something I normally go, but I only originate plans if I feel I&#x27;m doing it for others e.g. if someone is visiting I&#x27;ll setup a dinner for us all. At the end of a week when I&#x27;ve been busy I cab be annoyed at how much of my life is spent doing things for others, but I do know that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t do anything at all for myself.<p>I&#x27;m married and I wouldn&#x27;t say I am because it&#x27;s something expected of me. I think I want to be healthy mentally later in life and I know I can put the work in to give my wife a happy life, also that I didn&#x27;t hide the way I am from her. If I didn&#x27;t do these things it would be equivalent to just kind of giving up and I guess I haven&#x27;t done that so I do these kind of things for future me who I want to be in a good place. I do love, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite the feeling love is to others but love/loss are recognisable.<p>I work to succeed and for financial security basically, I can&#x27;t fathom a job I &quot;enjoy&quot; but in my mind besides paying bills it&#x27;s like a game and I win if I&#x27;m successful. A good way to think about it is when a big project finishes it&#x27;s a bit weird for me because I don&#x27;t really get happiness or pleasure or a sense of achievement from it, it&#x27;s kind of like a vaccum. The day a system goes live is no different from day 1 on the project. Within the vaccum I just get hyper-critical of my performance I think my brain is thinking it&#x27;s important to improve for next time and just immediately focusses on what it needs to do to make that happen.<p>I do watch films/games, although not that much, but I like being distracted and having something to do. I watch twitch and sport where I do find it easy to support teams. I would never be upset after a result in sport or anything, I don&#x27;t get nervous before or excited after a win but I like the pattern, which players are good/bad, analysing tactics, following the story etc.<p>Reward mechanism - I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything in my life like that I could google it but not sure what it means. I don&#x27;t do anything to reward myself at all.",1444226801

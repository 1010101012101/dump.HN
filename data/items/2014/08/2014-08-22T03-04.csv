He makes an unfounded leap from the biological result that cancer seems to be an intrinsic property of genetic processes in cells (and the statements &quot;You have to interfere with fundamental pathways&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a web of interactions&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s very difficult to do&quot;) to the assertion &quot;will probably never be completely eradicated&quot;.  Difficult is not the same as impossible.<p>He follows with more sensationalism: &quot;You carry a time bomb in your body when you&#x27;re born,&quot; he said. &quot;It can explode early in life, or middle age or later.&quot;<p>I suppose it&#x27;s understandable; he&#x27;s probably just trying to get some publicity for his team&#x27;s long-running research on hydra.  And even he admits &quot;that doesn&#x27;t mean that, with a patient who develops cancer, there&#x27;s nothing you can do.&quot;<p>But then the hedging of &quot;probably&quot; and &quot;completely&quot; was discarded by the article writers for a more sensationalist article and headline.",1408679987

And I would say that&#x27;s something that should happen fairly soon with the advent of Bitcoin.<p>To understand why regulations always make it worse for the consumer and what the alternative might be, try to imagine how a society would work without a state. That is, imagine there&#x27;s no way a state and government can ever emerge. How would society organize itself. Come up with solutions. And surely you will find ways that are much more elegant and humane. These days, people see problem and their first reaction is apply government to it: &quot;we have poor people that cannot afford healthcare, therefore government!&quot;, all the while every possible example in the world points out that only in places where government was less pervasive, poor people had more opportunities to rise and climb the ladder.",1408679832

8210828,comment,8209966,8210587,1,0,zacman85,,,"Hi Billy,<p>Founder of imgix here. The comparison image is just meant to be moderately informative. We will be following up with a detailed performance outline as more data comes in. You can compare the progressive JPEG image against the WebP or JPEG XR to get a sample of what the ratios might be for a standard JPEG. Besides, a surprising number of websites still serve wildly uncompressed and unoptimized imagery. We help websites that are serving uncompressed JPEG and PNGs all of the time.<p>Furthermore, what should be understood (and I will clarify in the post) is that apart from the example image, which is designed to show the comparative compression ratios of the file formats, the data we report is based on the images that these companies are ALREADY serving. We analyzed our logs for what the image size is that they are currently serving as JPEGs and PNGS at the same size and simply enabled content negotiation for those same sized images.<p>With regards to the Vary header. You are right that the cache fragmentation of varying by Accept or User Agent would be extreme. This is why we do not do this. Instead, we perform normalization on the request and generate a specific &quot;content ID&quot; that takes into account any number of input signals that should be normalized and varied on. We can expose this as a separate header to folks who want to Vary on if folks want it. Finally, if you are serving directly out of us, none of this really matters. There is no web server involved. We handle all of the hard work on our end.<p>I disagree that content negotiation is the wrong approach though. The fragmentation we see across all of the input signals (e.g. format support, device pixel ratio, user agent, etc) is already so extreme that the best answer is to serve dynamic responses for images. If you want to stay within in the browser prefetch stage, which is critical for front-end performance, you have to make decisions about the content you want to serve at the server. This means potentially serving variant content under a single URL. We serve targeted responses for text content all the time across the web. It is not clear from your argument as to why this same treatment should not apply to imagery.<p>Happy to discuss further,\nChris",1408679765

8210814,comment,8209523,8210525,4,0,liamca,,,"ChuckMcM, you are absolutely right.  Nailing down QPS rates are an incredibly tough thing.  Not just for Azure Search but also for most Search engines that I am aware of.  Things like #&#x27;s of facets, complexity of queries all play a part in what a search engine can serve up from a QPS rate.  When we say ~15QPS we try to point out that this is based on an average index of the ones that we have seen from our typical customers.  Certainly some customers may see way more QPS on a single search unit and others will see less.<p>The main markets (or scenarios) that we target with Azure Search are eCommerce Retail, User Generated Content sites (such as a recipe site or Hacker News) and internal organizational apps. The interesting thing about internal organizational apps is that we are seeing more an more users are finding that search is a natural way to navigate and explore their data.  Users are typically far more knowledgeable of using search to explore their data thanks to engines like Google and Bing then then are with say SQL.<p>We actually don&#x27;t have an official SLA yet for this preview. That is one of the goals of this public preview which is to really determine what we can realistically promise for our v1 release.<p>Yes, privacy is a thing for sure.  It is interesting that you say lawyers because we have had a number of companies in the law field that have wanted to use Azure Search.  Things like indexing of case documents is quite popular from what I have seen. In many of these examples (and also with Helathcare especially), privacy or more specifically encryption at rest as well as compliance (such as HIPPA) often become critical.  As of today we don&#x27;t have either. We don&#x27;t have encryption at rest and we do not have HIPPA compliance for Azure Search.  Of course, this will be a goal and I guess we need to start somewhere.  The encryption as it relates to search is actually going to be a really hard thing to do properly so that will be an interesting thing for the future.<p>By the way, WikiPedia is one of the datasets we often test with our service.  Feel free to ping me as we have a loader for the WikiPedia dataset that I could look into sharing with you if would you like to play with it and Azure Search.

And who made most of the things illegal that produced those crime-ridden communities? You guessed it, the state. Besides, which places are usually most secure and locked and fenced? Again, it&#x27;s state property, not private property.<p><i>> They&#x27;re created through legal process with the consent of the population</i><p><i>Population</i> is a very abstract collectivist term. First of all, even if the majority thinks something is a good idea it by no means should lead to other people being forced to comply. If 90% decided to shoot the rest of the 10% in the head, would you still argue it&#x27;s okay to do so? Second, saying that force is required so that the rebellious minority complied is inaccurate: if you remove that threat of force, I guarantee you (and I believe that after careful consideration, you would agree with me), the <i>majority</i> would stop paying. Therefore, the threat of force is the major factor, not just some minor necessity.<p><i>> requiring unanimity will get you nowhere in terms of having a functioning society. Some decisions are hard but necessary.</i><p>That is a statement, not an argument. Why do you believe that only through taxation a functioning society is possible? Why is it a necessary thing? Why do we need unanimity and why can&#x27;t people spend their money each as they please? I guess, a great way to try and at least think of an alternative solution would be imagine a world where having any kind of state is practically impossible (say, anyone who proclaims itself a government employee dies of a violent diarrhea on the spot) and try to think of ways a society would organize itself.

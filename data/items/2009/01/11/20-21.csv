Despite the fuzziness of the term, I think Objective-C would meet most any bar that didn't specifically require the language to be interpreted. The only thing I can imagine being an issue is lack of support for closures, but a) it's coming to the language, and b) it's not radically more expressive than what objective-c already has to offer.",1231707276

I don't mean that producing requires more psychological investment and effort; that's a given, in any case. I mean that society makes it much easier to fill the role of the consumer than the producer. You can consume cheaply and easily, as if the world is begging people to consume.<p>Producing, in any meaningful, useful, and psychologically sustainable context, is very difficult. Most people don't get to do it. At the very least, you need an audience. Realistically, you also need people to pay you to produce, which means that your odds of getting meaningful work are long (unless you're the only one skilled enough to do the interesting work, the people with the money take the meaningful projects and throw you the scraps). Consequently, 85 percent of people cannot attain work that is more valuable or interesting than watching TV. This is why we're a nation of non-producing consumers.",1231707170

My point is that, if you want a successful company, you need to keep the financial side in focus too.  Gates, Jobs, and Ellison had the business focus from the beginning.<p>OTOH if the monetary side is of little or no consequence, the Open Source community is the way to go.

On the other hand, it sound an awful lot like <i>""there are worse things in the world than sitting at a cushy desk for 10 hours a day, whiner.""</i>  The latter seems to undermine the former.<p>One of the best jobs I've ever had was manual labor:  I was a bellman for a hotel.  My primary job responsibilities included lifting heavy luggage in 100-degree heat, being yelled at by cranky guests, and running around non-stop for 10-hour shifts.  What made it great?  I was almost completely autonomous, and I got paid a little bit of money every time I did some work.  There was almost always a direct consequence when I did good work, and nobody told me how to do my job.  (My boss didn't even work on the same shift!)<p>I've worked a lot of much more ""comfortable"" jobs since that time, and I've had a lot of time to think about why that luggage-monkey job was so much better than nearly all of the intellectual gigs I've held.  So far, I think it boils down to a simple point:  there's no worse tyranny than being told how to think.  No matter how much luggage I lifted, I was always free with my thoughts.  But when you work in an industry where your <i>thoughts</i> are your primary output, it's inevitable that someone (or some<i>thing</i>) will try to consume <i>all</i> of them.  When that happens, you're on a path to burnout.",1231704508

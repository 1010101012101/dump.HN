1131342,comment,1131304,1131304,0,0,lsc,,,"Yeah, allmost all AUPs say ""we can fuck you and there is nothing you can do about it""  - but most of the time, you expect the company to behave reasonably.<p>Speaking as someone who has to write AUPs, this is something I spend some time thinking about.<p>Sometimes it's pretty obvious, like the guy is selling fake rolexes, etc... but sometimes it's more subtle.  I mean, I don't want to be a haven for people breaking the laws, but I also don't want to be a pushover that kicks off legitimate users who have just pissed off people who like to file abuse reports.<p>This is, I think, why a reasonable AUP and set of policies is important.  It should be simple for me, or for someone who works for me who reads the policy do decide how they should react to a particular abuse report.",1266407917

1131333,comment,1130243,1130599,0,0,ilitirit,,,"I think there is far more to it than that.  Take for example the question of creation.  It could be possible that our Universe was created, but not designed (<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2006/08/5027.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2006/08/5027.ars</a>).  Under those conditions, the creator would not be able to intervene in our actions (unless he/she/they destroy the Universe), so they couldn't really be classified as evil or immoral.  Which also leads to some interesting questions:  If this Universe was created by beings in a laboratory, and they somehow managed to convey this information to us and threatened to destroy the Universe unless we worshipped them, how many people would actually do it? Etc etc.<p>Either way, as far as ""God"" goes, colour me apathetically agnostic.  Nothing meaningful can be said about the existence (or lack thereof) of undetectable entities, so I don't concern myself with them.  But unlike many atheists, I don't care enough about the topic to proclaim this view.",1266407223

1131330,comment,1130984,1130984,0,0,Patient0,,,"The ""Is my husband a cheat"" riddle is actually very well known. It's just the Blue Eyed Islander puzzle in disguise: (<a href=""http://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html</a>) also known as the Muddy Children puzzle. Discussed here too: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)</a><p>and here: \n<a href=""http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/the-blue-eyed-islanders-puzzle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/the-blue-eyed-islan...</a><p>In fact, a whole book has been written about it and related issues:<p><a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=8240"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&#38...</a><p>It's a fascinating riddle because it introduces the subtle concept of ""what somebody knows about what someone else knows about what someone else knows about X"".<p>But such a well discussed and complicated puzzle therefore also makes a bad, or at least ""unfair"", interview question. If you've heard it before, read that book, read Terence Tao's post on it... etc.. you'll easily ace this riddle.<p>If you haven't heard of it before, it's going to take you way longer than just a few minutes to get your head around it.<p>So as an interview question, it's testing what you ""know"", not how well you think.",1266406734

What happens when you try to do that is you get a compiler error, because it won't implicitly cast from, say, bigint or unsigned int down to signed int, for example. That's not necessarily a defect, that's just a constraint.<p>This contrasts with the overflow defect which would cause the mergesort routine to fail when given an otherwise perfectly valid input.",1266406121

Rather there are certain core facets that are necessitated. If certain aspects of your Catholic belief went away your belief in that particular religion would change (e.g. if you couldn't believe in the Trinity, you wouldn't quite be able to consider yourself a Catholic, I think). As I should have qualified my original statements more, I'll qualify I don't think any religion is a monolithic set of beliefs, I'm quite aware it's rather fluid and flexible as you describe.<p>I'm also not discounting someone discovering new tenets via that same type of self-investigation.<p>I'd be quite interested to learn more about such self-questioning, as well as what limitations if any you impose on yourself.",1266405727

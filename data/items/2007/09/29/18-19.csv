Users and user management, and shared auth across all services (theoretically...Joomla is a joke on this front...nothing useful uses the native user interfaces, they're all bridged applications--at this point our ""Joomla website"" is actually almost entirely non-Joomla apps bridged into Joomla, and Joomla just makes things like adding new content or new applications harder).<p>2. Applications sharing a single API.  This is least true with Joomla, unfortunately, as it's got the most applications.  So, the more apps a CMS offers, the less well-integrated those apps are.  In my past two websites I've needed: shopping cart, forums, issue tracker, wiki, and FAQ manager.  All but one of those is a bridged app in our current website.  They were all integrated, by some definition of integrated, in the OpenACS variant of the site, but OpenACS is a nightmare to work on--second-system syndrome has set in with OACS and it could be years before a Firefox-style simplicity revolution occurs for the codebase (if it has the community enthusiasm for such a rebirth to occur).  To be fair to OACS, now that I've switched to Joomla, there are several things that OACS got right that Joomla fails miserably at.<p>Short answer is that, so far, every time I deploy a CMS, I end up wishing I'd just picked the best of breed applications I needed, and modify them to share a single auth session and state and use the same style.  I'm pretty sure that, in the long run, will save a lot of time and offer a better user experience.<p>Of course, the simple fact is that I really don't need a CMS.  I like (the idea of) the applications that come with some of the bigger CMS systems, but the CMS itself is useless to me.  Even in a reasonably large company where a CMS seems like the right idea, I found that no one could ever be convinced to use the CMS to add content.  When switched to a simple wiki, the website exploded in usefulness to everyone, and everyone started contributing content.  CMS systems are just too ornery to use to add content.  I've always dreaded the process with all of them except OpenACS (which allowed flat files to be part of the content of the site, unlike other CMS systems that insist on having it in the database).  So, the more time I spend with CMS systems, the more I think lots of people are chasing down a deadend road, and I've followed them on more than one occasion.<p>Can you tell I'm a little frustrated with the state of the CMS world?",1191091955

Drupal is actually next on my list of CMS systems to waste hours of my life on making fit my needs...I was kinda hoping it was better than all the other ones I've used.  (You see?  I'm sick.  I have a real problem.)",1191090740

Imagine the outrage if Apple or Microsoft sold desktop PCs that allowed you to connect to the Internet only through Comcast -- and then, if you tried to use Earthlink instead, the company would shut down your machine. Or what if Ford allowed you to drive your new Explorer only to Wal-Mart to buy your groceries; if you went instead to Whole Foods, a company official would come by and slash your tires.""",1191090726

This contrasts sharply with the average entrepreneur, where part of the appeal is escaping professionalism.""<p>There's a subtle point you missed here. Many of these women were asked to order lunch because the male thought it was the woman -- of lesser position -- who should take lunch orders. There's a difference between doing something because everyone is sharing mundane tasks in a startup and being singled out for those positions.<p>Those women were absolutely right to assert their status there in a corporate environment -- and in a startup environment as well if a woman partner is subconsciously being relegated the mundane tasks for no other reason than that she's a woman.\n",1191090085

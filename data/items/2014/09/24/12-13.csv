8361155,comment,8360388,8360388,3,0,drfritznunkie,,,"I regularly tested the &quot;email regex du jour&quot; at my previous job whenever these types of articles came up. IIRC, it was against 15+MM known good email addresses, and probably double that in known bads and nearly every one tested had its issues. [edit: we had something like 150,000 distinct active domains, and probably 1/2 that of distinct MXes (if you rolled up all the google-biz and microsoft hosted stuff)... if you think getting your email delivered by gmail is difficult, try a school district in Wyoming that appeared to have a 300baud connecting it to world running an ancient version of Groupware that rejected email according to the weather report as far as we could tell...]<p>Most people working on the code for that sign-up page (/what have you) neither have the regex-fu necessary nor the understanding of email to write the regex correctly... So you get a lot of shitty regexes (especially large corporations) that don&#x27;t support apostrophes or dashes/plus signs in the local parts. And it doesn&#x27;t matter how good your regex-fu and RFC comprehension abilities are, there are a <i>lot</i> of broken implementations out there and blocking a subscriber because of their broken system isn&#x27;t a great business.<p>It took awhile, but eventually we switched our signup forms to do a couple of very effective things beyond a very simple address regex:\n1) auto-suggest for common misspellings of our most common domains (gmal.com, yaho.com, etc.)\n2) while the &quot;please re-type your email&quot; gave us enough user delay, we did a DNS lookup of the domain, then an MX lookup. If there was a problem with either, we passed an error to the user like &quot;Please double check the domain of your email address...&quot;\n3) check for domains you know have moved. We were B2B, so if you watched your bounces closely, you&#x27;d know that asdf.com was moving to hjkl.com, so you could update your existing records, but people have serious muscle memory, and it&#x27;s worth reminding them on the signup page.<p>I was working on tying in our bounce database (you <i>are</i> keeping a record of all your bounces, right?) so that automatically flagged domains would prompt the user with an error like &quot;We&#x27;ve been unable to deliver to your email domain recently, if your email address is typed correctly, we recommend using a secondary email address if you have one...&quot;",1411563524

But maybe in the future, and because of my main point:  It&#x27;s fully possible for the planning to be rock solid and lead to a successful product with low risk.  That&#x27;s the main point -- it really is possible, indeed, in applied science and engineering, nearly standard.<p>That the examples were not commercial products need not detract much from the main point -- again, we can plan just on paper and have a low risk, high payoff project.<p>But now we have <i>enhanced</i> opportunities:  The math I assumed can be cheap, for someone with an appropriate math background, dirt cheap, fast, fun, easy, and low risk.  Then for the <i>product,</i> I assumed that that is just software.  So the guy who does the math also does the software -- we&#x27;re still in the low budget area.  Next, the product needs computer hardware, but now enough computer hardware to execute 100,000 lines of code can be less than $2000.<p>If the <i>product</i> is just a Web site supported by ads, then for just a focused start, where I agree with Altman, might do quite well:  E.g., maybe the start up sends Web pages of 400,000 bits per page.  Each page has on average 5 ads.  From the Mary Meeker data at KPCB, maybe get paid $2 per 1000 ads displayed (CPM = $2).  Maybe have an Internet connection with 25 million bits per second upload bandwidth.  Maybe half fill that 24 x 7.  Then the monthly revenue would be<p>2 * 5 * 25 * 10<i></i>6 * 3600 * 24 * 30 / ( 2 * 400,000 * 1000 ) = 810,000<p>dollars.  That&#x27;s enough to fuel <i>organic</i> growth.<p>So, on average, how many Web pages sent per second?<p>25 * 10<i></i>6 / ( 2 * 400,000 ) = 31.25<p>Depending on the project, that\nmight take several computers at $2000 each, but\nif early on send just 1 page a second, and for some projects early on one computer could do that, and get monthly revenue of<p>1 * 2 * 5 * 3600 * 24 * 30 / ( 1000 ) = 25,920<p>dollars\nso that in one month have free cash flow enough to buy computers enough to send 31.25 Web pages a second.<p>The 31.25 Web pages a second is a lot of Web pages per month, is<p>31.25 * 3600 * 24 * 30 = 81,000,000<p>So how to justify this?  Well, as we assumed, the first good or a much better solution for the problem is a &quot;must have&quot;.  The problem has been selected so that we can attack it essentially just with math.  We do the math, as theorems and proofs, and check the proofs carefully -- fairly routine and low chances of errors for a well trained pure/applied mathematician.  We convert the math to software and check the software -- again, fairly routine with low risk of errors.  Now we have the <i>product</i>, and it is a &quot;must have&quot;.  Then we go to Altman&#x27;s lecture and use what he said about viral growth.  And we use the assumption that the problem is such that many people want the solution (I hope I made that assumption clear also).  What&#x27;s left to do?  Get the checks from the ad networks.  Yes, very much do need to meet the assumptions, find the solution, write the software, etc., and if can&#x27;t then return to (1) and try again.<p>Once I had a project that looked pretty good on the alternative approach, but the software was going to be too much work because I&#x27;d need to write a lot of code for a lot of data collection and with too little information about what the APIs and interfaces were or would be.  So, I dropped the project.  That is, back to step (1).<p>You are correct that nearly all the successful, famous projects I listed were, yes, routine, but expensive to execute.  And for a start up, we need projects that are cheap to execute.  Do such projects exist?  I believe so.",1411562099

Most SLC tends to be rated for 100K cycles and 10 years of retention; assuming a roughly inverse correlation, at 10K or 1K cycles the retention goes up considerably to a century or more.<p><i>The consumer market is similar: Most people don&#x27;t ever buy replacements for failed drives - they buy a newer computer.</i><p>That is true, but the long-term implications are more subtle; the fact is that most people don&#x27;t backup, and quite a few of them keep the old drives (that were still working when they were replaced) around as &quot;backup&quot;, with the implicit assumption that the data on them will likely still be there if they ever decide e.g. that they wanted to find an older version of some file they had. With flash memory, this assumption no longer holds.<p>On a longer timescale, we&#x27;ve been able to &quot;recover data&quot; from stone tablets, ancient scrolls and books, this being a very valuable source of historical information; and most if not all of that data was probably never considered to be worth archiving or preserving at the time. More recently, rare software has been recovered from old disks ( <a href=""http://www.chrisfenton.com/cray-1-digital-archeology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chrisfenton.com/cray-1-digital-archeology/</a> ).  Only the default, robust nature of the media made this possible.<p>Despite modern technology increasing amount of storage available, and the potential to have it persist for a very long time, it seems we&#x27;ve shifted from &quot;data will persist unless explicitly destroyed&quot; to &quot;data will NOT persist unless explicitly preserved&quot;, which agrees well with the notion that we may be living in one of the most forgettable periods in history.

The neuromorphic computing research is interesting but for the time being the real advances in the field are being made with more conventional hardware and I&#x27;m not convinced we yet have a good enough understanding of this field to create an effective new hardware architecture for it.<p>As for cloud computing it certainly has advantages for many types of customers but I think many of the large businesses that represent the lion&#x27;s share of IBM&#x27;s customer base will be wanting to maintain their own computing infrastructure for the foreseeable future.  They simply will not be willing to trust 3rd parties with their sensitive data, especially in light of the lack of legal protections in the US for data that is in the hands of 3rd parties.<p>So where does this leave IBM&#x27;s current (or prospective) customers ?  x86 is gone.  If IBM&#x27;s strategy is to push POWER as the way forward, that would be great, but are they really doing that or are they going to let POWER wither ?  Will customers need to put Lenovo hardware in their data center to manage their POWER systems ?  Some customers probably won&#x27;t be willing to do that (in the US, at least, for other countries trusting Chinese vs. US companies may look like comparable risks).<p>I suspect that a major selling point for IBM&#x27;s software and services has been its ability to provide the full range of hardware needed to run a data center, from servers to SAN storage.  If their transition plans involve giving up this advantage then I think this transition will be a very rocky and risky one that will result in many of their customers looking elsewhere.",1411560422

However, I&#x27;ll try. :-)<p>In essence, maven comes from Yiddish, and it means &quot;one who accumulates knowledge&quot;.  Economists spend a lot of time studying mavens and their habits.<p>Mavens are the people who will analyze every big screen TV on the market, pouring over data, correcting consumer report articles on minutia, and looking for the best deal.  They&#x27;re also the ones who analyze flight itineraries looking for the best combination of layovers and low fare, and they are the tiny fraction of people who actually read the prices on goods in a supermarket and will complain when the supermarket writes &quot;special offer&quot; on something without actually lowering the price, thus holding the market to account.<p>The interesting thing about mavens is that they not only pour over this data for their own purposes, but they actively share it with the world (even if &#x27;world&#x27; only means &#x27;other people they talk to directly&#x27;) at large in order to help others, consciously or unconsciously.<p>The work of the few obsessors benefits everyone because markets don&#x27;t &quot;get away&quot; with conning us.",1411560379

If you are a game dev looking to break into the industry, you <i>do</i> need a lead - something good to show off what you can do - but really all you need is a demo of your capabilities, and with something like Unity you can get something out the door really quick. You just need to demonstrate competency. And you should probably give that one away.<p>Then if you actually intend to make a legitimate project, of scale, with huge developer costs et al, go kickstart it. If you don&#x27;t have the finances to gamble on if or if not enough people will voluntarily give you an arbitrary amount of money effectively as a donation for making the game <i>after</i> the fact, find out if they are willing to give you a fraction of it beforehand. If not, your game would not have sold anyway.<p>And if you say something along the lines of &quot;they have no audience, how can they kickstart?&quot; then I ask you how they can sell their game in the first place, if they have no audience.

When I worked at Timeout.com they were importing information about hotels from a large number of sources. For some insane reason, they were storing the data in MySql. Processing was 2 step:<p>1.) the initial import was done with PHP<p>2.) a later phase normalized all the data to the schema that we wanted, and this was written in Scala<p>The crazy thing was that, during the first phase, we simply pulled in the data and stored it in the form that the 3rd party was using. That meant that we had a separate schema for every 3rd party that we imported data from. I think we pulled data from 8 sources, so we had 8 different schemas. When they 3rd party changed their schema, we had to change ours. If we added a 9th source of information, then we would have to create a 9th schema in MySQL. We also checked the 3rd party schema at this phase, which struck me as silly because this did not mean that step 2 could be innocent of the schema, rather, both step 1 and step 2 would have to know the structure of those foreign schemas, but it was necessary because we were writing to a database that had a schema.<p>The system struck me as verbose and too complicated.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that most of the work involved with step 1 could be skipped entirely if we used MongoDB. Simply import documents, and don&#x27;t care about their schema. Dump all the data we get in MongoDB. Then we can move straight to step 2, which is taking all those foreign schemas and normalizing them to the schema that we wanted to use.<p>For ETL situations like, NoSQL document stores offer a huge convenience. Just grab data and dump it somewhere. Simplify the process. Your transformation phase is the only phase that should have to know about schemas, the import phase should be allowed to focus on the details of getting data and saving it.",1423496265

I already owned 1-4 on DVD, but needed #5. I could not find it. iTunes, Netflix, and other streaming services didn&#x27;t have it. Stores were sold out. I did spend more time than I thought it deserved trying to find a way to pay for this content. Then I gave up and torrented it. The kicker? iTunes removed the movie about a week before this.<p>My other random perspective on torrenting/piracy is this: the industry will often use the price of the digital good * number of downloads as the figure for the loss of profits. However, this gives them way too much credit. They don&#x27;t have the magic oracle or the distribution system to price each sale individually so as to extract the maximum amount of money from every buyer (Alice thinks the movie is worth $6.82 while Bob thinks it&#x27;s worth $9.13). I argue that if there is a million downloads of a movie off a torrent site, that does not mean a million lost sales. I imagine it&#x27;s closer to 0 than 1m.

She was delayed walking and as a result had low muscle tone.  Her attention (eye contact, joint attention) was also poor, which made learning other skills difficult.  Since very young she would hyper focus on objects like strings and would tantrum when you try to transition her to new task or object.  The objects were usually not appropriate or typical and her interaction with them was not considered typical (repetitive behavior).<p>She now walks, has great eye contact and joint attention and is learning new words everyday (though still has some speech issues).  She also plays more creatively and appropriately with toys... it&#x27;s really opened up so much for her.<p>Mostly these are play based therapies.  The difference is the way that tasks are broken down.  For a lot of kids you have to master and work on REALLY basic steps for a long time before moving to even basic things (like stacking rings or requesting an object).<p>Any kid would benefit from these therapies, there is no magic to them.  It&#x27;s time and observation.  We set goals for her then work with specialists to break down the operations and work with her to master fundamentals.  Each new skill tends to unlock all sorts of other skills.<p>ABA is a trial based therapy that has a lot of good and bad information out there about it.  It is basically what I just described but in a much more structured and documented manner.  It&#x27;s one of the more researched methods of treatment and has been proven to be highly effective.  It&#x27;s again tailored to the child, so there is no good way of describing other than to say that it emphasizes mastery of skills, errorless learning (no negative responses for wrong behavior) and intense hours (some kids do 40 hours of ABA a week alone).<p>As I mentioned, each kid really has their own set of issues, so it&#x27;s tough to say what will work for each kid.<p>I read a few Behaviorist books when she was diagnosed.  A lot of the therapies/techniques are really just good parenting advice.",1423494366

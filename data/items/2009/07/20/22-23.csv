715369,comment,714816,714816,0,0,amohr,,,"I think there is one glaring flaw in the paper wherein pg assumes that nobody would write academic papers if there were no structure of competition necessitating such papers.  I have two problems with this:<p>1) I know several people who do indeed love writing these dry analyses - what they dislike is the academic format.  Given freedom of style, I think there are very few topics that you would never find anyone willing to write about.  For illustrative purposes, here's a google blog search with the same parameters as his academic search\n<a href=""http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=gender+identity+narrative+discourse+transcend&btnG=Search+Blogs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&#...</a><p>2) I think it's blatantly fallacious to assume that there is nobody in the world that wants to do a particular job.  There are certainly garbage men who enjoy their work.  Of course, this number doesn't really live up to our need for garbage men.  But that's why different jobs pay different amounts.

715364,comment,715166,715166,0,0,grellas,,,"A few general points from a lawyer who has worked with tech startups for a quarter century in Silicon Valley:<p>1. If your startup is looking to raise VC funding within the next year or so, consider WSGR or Cooley Godward or any similar large firm that is in NYC. They will be looking for companies they deem ""VC fundable"" and, if your startup meets this criterion in their judgment, they can and will make valuable introductions to their network of VC firms with whom they deal. This large-firm approach is not particularly flexible but it works very well for the right startups. Their expertise is beyond question, and such firms do offer deferred-fee arrangements as a matter of routine for the right startups.<p>2. If you are looking to stay more flexible and nimble in how you approach the next year or so, consider a boutique firm that specializes in early-stage tech startups. I don't know the NYC market at this level but would imagine that such firms exist. You will most likely find a good one via referral from other professionals.<p>A boutique firm will tend to give you much more flexibility in how you approach funding solutions for the company. It is a good option if you do not necessarily want to feel pressured to take on VC funding early on. VC funding at an early stage can be a mixed blessing because that is precisely the point at which you will receive the least favorable terms for your funding.<p>3. Avoid ""wannabe"" startup law firms. It seems that all sorts of little firms now want to say that they are startup specialists. A few are but most aren't. If all you see (e.g., on their websites) is marketing lingo couched in very broad terms, you need to be cautious. In general, any law firm worth its salt in the early-stage tech field will be expert in handling the types of issues I discuss here (<a href=""http://www.grellas.com/faq_business_startup.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grellas.com/faq_business_startup.html</a> - these tutorials may help you quite apart from your search for a law firm, since their goal is to educate founders about early-stage issues in particular). The firm should also be expert in doing funding rounds, IP and e-commerce legal work.<p>4. Very few startup lawyers will do direct trades of services for equity. It usually is a bad idea for tax reasons for the startup because it puts a high price on your founders' stock and limits your ability to offer quality incentives to your key people.<p>The much more common practice is a deferred-fee arrangement. Under this type of deal, the firm might extend, say, up to $20K worth of credit for legal services which does not come due until the earlier of some defined time period (e.g., 6 months) or first funding. In exchange for incurring the credit risk, the firm will take some small percentage of founders' stock.",1248128717

Even if our technology didn't improve fundamentally past what we know how to do now, we'd have at least a century before we <i>had</i> to go get more resources elsewhere, and we already know how to do that (though we'll need a lot more engineering to actually do it, of course).  Meanwhile, the more people there are, the more engineers and innovators there are.  If we don't get hit by an asteroid or literally destroy ourselves, the future is pretty damn bright. :)",1248127276

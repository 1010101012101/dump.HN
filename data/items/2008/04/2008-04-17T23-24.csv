and users is not comparable at all with a service like Facebook. You're talking about an OS that comes pre-installed in the computers most people use, they generally don't know how to keep it updated, much less remove it and install a different one. Anyone can join a new web service.<p>Oh and btw part of the reason Google stays at the top (at least with regard to revenues) <i>IS</i> because they're at the top. Having an enormous inventory is a big part of the ads business.",1208475437

Geim's group has in the past used ""exfoliated"" graphene (basically the graphene is just peeled off with a bulk sample with scotch tape) And made some amazing discoveries that connect solid state physics to relativistic quantum field theory because of graphene's unique band structure. But for making electronic devices where you would want to pattern ~10^6 transistors, the exfoliation process is very hard to control and seems unlikely to scale well.  When someone can produce a graphene sample the size of IC die call me.  Still it does seem to have a lot of theoretical advantages over silicon, GaAs et. al. (especially the possibility of ballistic conduction)",1208474176

3558683,story,,,5,8,famousactress,"Ask HN: My 14 yr old sister wants to learn to program. Best option?",,"I've been developing software professionally for a long time. Mostly server, SaaS, web stuff in the healthcare space. My half-sister is 14 years old, extremely computer literate, and an avid gamer (WoW, and some other MMORPG stuff that I'm not familiar with).<p>She's recently come to an understanding about where games come from, and wants to learn to program. Of course, she's interested in game development. The Intro-to-Programming, and AP Computer Science classes at her high school have been cancelled.. and I'm struggling to find the best path for her. Like a lot of kids her age, she doesn't always stick to things she gets interested in, and I'd really like to set her up with the best possible chance of having an encouraging experience.<p>She wants to take a class that's structured and scheduled, since she's already struggled with some self-paced online tutorials, etc. I think an ideal setup for her would be a curriculum that's targeted to people her age, and uses exercises that get her building programs that do something more fun than multiplying matrices.<p>She lives in the San Diego area, in case that's helpful.<p>Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.",1328554728

3558672,comment,3557620,3558445,8,0,hugoduncan,,,"Pallet was actually born out of frustration using chef to automate a website at my previous startup. The initial versions actually used chef solo, and added jclouds for node provisioning (we actually demo'd this to Opscode, back before Fog was integrated in knife). I am by no means an expert in Chef, but Pallet intentionally makes a very distinct set of design decisions.<p>For instance, the reference to ""copy/paste"" you mention, and which is easy to misinterpret.  Recipe reuse in chef is very much at the source code level - checkout a recipe and edit it for your specifics. Pallet places much more emphasis on using recipes (or crates as we call them) as library functions, in cleanly versioned packages (jar files). This allows you version your recipes, add them as dependencies to your projects, and cleanly separates the configuration data from the recipe code.<p>On a perhaps more fundamental level, the push model seems to be much more suited to automating configuration across nodes - eg. getting your haproxy pointing to your web frontends. While this is somewhat possible in Chef, it is left to the user to achieve. In Pallet there is first class support for this sort of cross node configuration. It makes it easy to have mixins, that say ensure a node is monitored, or it's log files collected.<p>A couple of additional advantages of the push model are that it leaves you free to use API's without having to push credentials for those api's to all your nodes and allows you to use Pallet for command and control.<p>Finally Chef and Puppet are both great frameworks. Pallet is a library.<p>Hopefully this outlines some of the differences in approach between Pallet and Chef/Puppet. The use of clojure was certainly not the driving force, and I hope that wasn't the main message that came across.",1328554630

You have a positive outlook on what you can accomplish, and that's undoubtedly a good thing.<p>But, to be frank, the skills required to access my example problems above are not trivial. Let's consider the autodidactic route for computer vision:<p>1. You need to be cozy with linear algebra, convex optimization, calculus, and algorithmic complexity if you even want to understand prior research. This, alone, is 1-2 semesters of course load for a full-time student.<p>2. Then, you need to survey prior research to gain awareness about what already exists. You'll hit Google Scholar, search for papers, and have to circumvent article paywalls.<p>3. After that, you'll need to code your own framework (non-trivial) or convince other researchers to share their source code (very non-trivial--almost impossible, given that they might monetize or license their work, or their university owns said license).<p>4. Then you need to collect data to test your CV algorithm, iterate on it, etc.<p>Universities overcome <i>all of these barriers.</i> Hence, it is unrealistic to suggest one can produce cutting-edge CV work by themselves (or without university help).",1328552546

Firstly, you claim that you aren't worried about revenue right now. That's not a problem if you're doing this as a hobby, but since you are calling yourself a start-up, you better have some idea on how to monetize it.<p>Secondly, you appear to be scraping your data. Being in the automotive software business myself, I know that at least Cars.com and AutoTrader expressly prohibit scraping. Furthermore, I know how much they charge per month for their listing data and if you aren't interested in revenue (as you say) then you will have no hope of paying them for it. The data costs are significant. And since you are a quasi-competitor with them (as far as eyeballs go), I seriously doubt that they will see it to you anyway. That leaves scraping, which has no long-term future. They actively deter scrapers. And FWIW, AutoTrader will soon stop selling their data to any providers period. (Their purchase of vAuto makes selling their data to vAuto's competitors a bad idea.)<p>Finally, the way you ""hide"" cars is seriously flawed. It works great for commodity items, but not at all for vehicles. There are many factors which impact value. Price and mileage are but two. Installed options and packages are HUGE determinants of price. As is the type of engine, transmission, condition, one-owner status, etc,etc. You've picked two which admittedly make sense at a high-level, but a serious car shopper that knows exactly what he is looking for will simply find this annoying.<p>Anyway, good luck with your project. It's a great idea and I really do like the UI, but I think you need to take a realistic view of your business model before you invest more time and money into it.",1328552522

If that's the case, there's no point discussing this further, however, lets go ahead anyway.<p>> Most of your argument boils down to ""jQuery makes it easy for shit developers to write shit code, therefore you shouldn't use it"".<p>Shit developers will write shit code regardless of a library, just as good developers will write good code. The problem is that jQuery provides an abstraction to what's actually happening, and how the DOM treats events in the browser. The present status-quo of jQuery code boils down to abuse of innerHTML=""foo"", and binding events onto individual elements rather than bubbling up to a parent listener.<p>As I said, the culture around jQuery propagates the web with sub-standard code simply because it attracts cut+paste+tweak developers who don't really understand jQuery, never-mind what's going on behind the curtain, or how to use events in such a way that can lead to long-term maintainability. It discourages best practices because it's really good at hiding reality from developers.<p>Even if you're a good developer, why should you use jQuery? You aren't necessarily getting anything more done than usual if you know what you're doing and using a micro-framework under 10kb, or expand your framework with one of the modular fameworks that let you do so. Don't like Sizzle selector engine? Use something else.<p>> Compared to what? What parts are slow? Keep in mind it needs to support legacy browsers like IE6 before you answer those questions.<p>Compared to plain old JavaScript. Almost all of it is slower, modifying the DOM, binding events, AJAX has been known to expose memory leaks (an on-going problem in other places as well), jsperf is full of people who set up test cases to see the difference between jQuery and vanilla JS: <a href=""http://jsperf.com/browse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/browse</a><p>Two contrived examples, feel free to explore some more...<p>1. <a href=""http://jsperf.com/queryselector-vs-getelementbyid-perf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/queryselector-vs-getelementbyid-perf</a><p>2. <a href=""http://jsperf.com/modern-js-vs-jquery-append"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/modern-js-vs-jquery-append</a><p>Legacy support should not be a unilateral feature that every browser has to fell the pain of, it goes against the grain of progressive enhancement practices. I don't really buy into the whole ""we have to support IE6"" any more that it's now under 1.5% everywhere that's in my market. However, legacy support can easily be provided through polyfills that append the DOM methods, and standard JS object prototypes, sometimes these are called shims as well, it supplements a broken legacy browser-native API with something that matches modern implementations, or in some cases, normalizes spec implementation discrepancies. This means I don't have to check for activeX object every time I goto make an AJAX request, or other costly things.",1328551762

Say you have a button in the top left quadrant and your mouse around the bottom right corner. Now you move the mouse to point over the button. In doing so your initial move is quite ample towards the button. From speed and direction the OS could infer that you want to reach the button and ever so slightly steer your move towards it. This would be reevaluated at each 'step' across the move, giving a smooth, spline-like movement, and as you get closer to the button, its virtual size would grow ever so slightly, so that if you rush to the click and undershoot or overshoot it by a few pixels, the click still get registered. Even when there's nothing of interest on screen this system would still be registering samples, but doing NOOP, hence the preservation of the delay in a game situation.<p>Such a scenario would be impossible to do so close to the hardware as it would have no knowledge of the GUI. I have not even the foggiest idea if OSX does something even close to that but hey, you'll never know.

That's the nature of the small sample size. I'm not convinced that money plays a bigger role in the playoffs for a given team than in the regular season.<p>One valid consideration, in the context of the 2002 A's, could be that they built their success by adding wins on the margins. Put another way, the 2002 A's on average were one of the best teams in baseball, but the playoffs put greater emphasis on the ""top"" of the team, or the best players. That A's team was short on all-star talent, but made up for it by adding wins at the margins. But adding 2 wins by intelligently selecting a fifth starter doesn't matter in the playoffs, because said fifth starter will pitch out of the bullpen, if at all.<p>However, baseball is radically different than it was in 2002 and I don't think that still applies to the same extent. Almost every team is using the kind of player evaluation that Beane was using in 2002. There's still some fogey Joe Morgan types that just happen to be running baseball teams now, but they are by far in the minority. So now you have to be even smarter than Beane was at the time (see Friedman and the Rays) to be competitive on a budget. But the way Friedman et al. are doing it now isn't subject to the same implications as the way Beane did it when RBI was considered a good metric for talent evaluation.",1328551225

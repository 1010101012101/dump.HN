Aspiring actors and directors know that there are many others waiting to take their role - if they don't agree to the terms (however terrible) there are plenty of others waiting to take their place. Hollywood is a monopsony. They are a cartel whose absolute control of the market makes it more difficult for ""the heart and soul of Hollywood"" to pursue their dreams. Breaking up the Hollywood cartel would make things easier for aspiring actors and directors.<p>Second, while ""war may rarely be the solution"", that doesn't mean that there is no place for war. If the other side is willing to do whatever it takes to destroy you, you have to fight back or be destroyed. SOPA/PIPA showed that music and movie industry have absolutely no sympathy for legitimate internet users. If it comes down to a choice between accepting the SOPA/PIPA and fighting the media industry with every tool at my disposal, I'll choose to fight any day of the week.<p>Finally, Ben Parr brings out the ""what about the masterpieces?"" argument. He misses the point that masterpieces like Schindler's List and Planet Earth exist <i>despite</i> Hollywood, not because of it. The movie industries are not interested in taking ""unnecessary risks"" on a movie that may turn into the next Citizen Kane. Remember, ""masterpiece"" movies are not often popular or profitable. It's much safer for studios to fund yet another proven, moneymaking sequel. Breaking up the Hollywood cartel would allow those with higher tastes for risk to enter the movie funding business, making it easier for future masterpieces to gain funding.",1327114798

3492420,comment,3491542,3491897,2,0,skb_,,,"Well nothing is a full substitute for TV/movies, just like nothing is a substitute for novels. But the question is, is it an overall stronger form of entertainment? I'd say that video games definitely have the potential to be, the industry itself is already bigger than Hollywood and rapidly approaching the book industry [1]. And the market for games just keeps getting bigger that there is no point in trying to dissect why games are not a fit for certain people. It's still unexplored space as Minecraft, GTA, WoW, farmville and the Wii have shown. Make the right game and you can potentially gain a new audience.<p>And I'm not dodging your assertion either, because games can also be passive. I've spent god knows how many hours watching Starcraft II games - well more than I'd like to admit. That's a game that was built with spectators in mind. I probably enjoy watching the game more than playing it, as wonderful as it is. Apparently so do other people, TwitchTV is evidence enough.<p>1 - <a href=""http://vgsales.wikia.com/wiki/Video_game_industry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vgsales.wikia.com/wiki/Video_game_industry</a>",1327114652

3492409,comment,3490101,3491402,5,0,moldbug,,,"Both very insightful parents.  Note also that the TV/radio/press oligopoly (""mainstream media,"" if you will, though we could also say the ""WP: Reliable sources"" monopoly) receives a <i>huge</i> hidden subsidy in the form of confidential government information.<p>Ie, it's legal in practice for government officials to leak to Punch Sulzberger, but not to Julian Assange.  This makes it very hard for the latter to start his own competing ""WP: Reliable Source.""  (Just how do I become WP:Reliable anyway? Or how do I lose the privilege, if I abuse it?)<p>You could fix this hole by enacting a media equivalent of the SEC's Reg FD: the government must release all information to everyone at the same time.  Short of this, the mainstream press is best considered as a government organ - almost every story is the product of privileged information which leaves the journalist captive to his ""source.""  If he writes the wrong thing, the source stops sourcing and the journalist's career may well be over.<p>More broadly, those who attribute SOPA and the like solely to electoral corruption are seeing the moon but not the sun. Corporate bribes are certainly one form of institutional power in the American system, but not the only form or even the strongest.  In most areas, in fact, there's a permanent war between unaccountable corporate bribery and unaccountable bureaucratic tyranny.<p>What makes SOPA and the IPR area so awful is that the lobbyists and bureaucrats are both on the evil side.  Certainly no one's bribing the State Department to twist Spain's arm on IPR legislation.  State doesn't need or accept Hollywood's campaign contributions - it's a permanent agency.",1327114296

You could distribute the machima via a youtube like service that is specific for machima.<p>You might even get a completely new form of media, because it is not necessary to distribute a machima as a straight up video.<p>Viewing it could be like 'ghost' mode in an FPS, viewer gets to pick the angle from which the drama is watched.<p>If you read 'Count Zero', one of the ideas there is that going online into a 3D chat didn't really catch on until there were realistic human faces.

Read even the Wikipedia page about the ""Roaring Twenties"" and then tell me that the amount of change in that decade was slower than now.<p>Let's take some examples. Your baseline is the cell phone. The first commercial mobile phone was in 1983, so you're suggesting a time span of about 25 years. (Before 1983 it was possible to connect a two-way radio through to the phone system, but that's not the point you're trying to make.) By 1988, friends of mine had car phones. The StarTac phone came out in 1996 and marks the start of ""widespread consumer adoption."" But I would say that it took until 2005 where it started to supplant having a land line.<p>The first commercial (pre-built and for consumer use) radio receiver was in 1920. That marks the start of the ""golden age of radio"", which ended when TVs became more popular in the late 1950s. Surely that was as fast as the uptake of cell phones.<p>Semiconductor transistors were invented in 1947. ""Transisterization"" was so fast that crew of the Minnow had a transistor radio (in 1964) and no one was surprised by it. Transitors made entirely new categories of technology possible, so that we had a transistor-based game console (Pong-style ""tennis"" and ""racquet-ball"") in ~1975.<p>The first commercial (synthetic) detergents were introduced in 1933 (that's when Dreft was introduced) and ""by the 1950s, soap had almost been completely replaced by branched alkylbenzenesulfonates."" Not bad for 20 years! Actually it was bad, because we then found out it wasn't that biodegradable and had to find a replacement.<p>The neon light was first presented in 1910 and ""became very popular for signage and displays in the period 1920-1940.""<p>Prohibition lasted for 13 years in the US, and had a huge impact on daily life. That surely counts as an enormous change.<p>Cosmetics didn't become popular in the US until the 1910s, and the flappers of the 1920 used it with a vengeance. (WP says that previously it was too closely associated with prostitution, but the post-war trend was a reaction to the previously popular demure look, and that ""[a] skewed postwar sex ratio created a new emphasis on sexual beauty, and because of the influence of Hollywood.)<p>All these big changes took place on the same time scale as the cell phone. How then do you measure the amount of change now, and compare it to (say) the amount of change in the 1920s? When was the last time that most people were not ""tired of learning how to use new stuff""?",1327113550

It is important to separate the talented from the studios that profit from artists work.  The studios (and by extension production and distribution) are the ones that Y Combinator has declared 'war' on.  Other industries are being disrupted in a similar fashion.  This is nothing new.  I think many in this community realize the damage that the MPAA and the RIAA can cause now.  Why not hasten their demise through a process that is already playing out?",1327111809

But unlike YouTube, this site would be pay per view and 100% of the content would be provided by teams of content creators. No backroom licencing deals.<p>The end user pays a fixed monthly fee for what they watch. After you watch a show, you must rate it before you get to watch another. That means 100% of viewings are rated. At the end of the month all the shows are ranked according to the ratings, and the portion of the monthly fee that goes to content creators, would be divided according to the rankings.<p>OK, maybe this is more like Netflix than YouTube. The UI is not as important as the system of acquiring and paying for content which is directly tied to viewer rankings. You would need to have a multiple factor ranking system so that cat videos with shot with a shaky video camera can rank high in entertainment value but low in quality and thus earn less. Also a longer show should earn a bigger share than a 2-minute short.<p>There are other types of things that would also work for this YC request, but I hope to see this as one of the ones that YC funds.",1327111782

3492284,comment,3491542,3491874,4,0,derekp7,,,"My general retort to ""it's not stealing"", is that it is theft of service.  Say you went to get a hair cut, and didn't pay for it.  That would be stealing the service.  Same applies if the provider of a service splits the purchase among multiple buyers (like an actor in a play, performing for a 1000-seat audience).  Anyone that snuck into the theater would be stealing the service.  So by extent, the same should apply to the larger case of produced works (single creator, multiple customers splitting the cost).<p>On the flip side, it doesn't necessarily follow that every one who enjoys the benefits from a created work actually owes the creator anything.  Like if you are listening to a CD at a friends house -- does every one in the room then own the artist?  Or anyone who admires public architecture.  So historically, it has come down to that if there is money to be made off of a created work, it is the original artist that should benefit from it (in the case of publishing books, music, etc).  That model works (morally) as long as producing copies of a work requires enough capital investment & individual unit costs so that the publisher is almost guaranteed to need to turn a profit off of each unit -- some of that profit should go to the creator.  But that model breaks down when you have zero cost / no profit sharing between individuals.  Now we are back to the pre-publishing era again.",1327111667

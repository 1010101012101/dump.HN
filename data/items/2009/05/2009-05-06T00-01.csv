I've been an ER nurse for years, and the most rewarding times of that career have been when I can work my tail off to keep a donors body going long enough to harvest the organs.

We are a startup company in stealth mode and we're working to win the Techcrunch50 (www.techcrunch50.com).  To win, we need the creative talents of a graphic designer to help us out.  It's about six weeks work, starting now.  We don't have a cash budget but we can ""pay you forward"" (see job ad).  It doesn't matter where you are located.  Here is the job ad http://www.seek.com.au/users/apply/index.ascx?JobID=15352696
I'm aware that finding a designer without payment is a challenge but we want to change the world and we need to be relentlessly resourceful to get there.  We'd love to hear from you.

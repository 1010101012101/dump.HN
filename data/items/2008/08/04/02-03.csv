265922,comment,265842,265842,0,0,eugenejen,,,"I was thinking of something like yours for a while. But mine is more close to accent training for several different languages. I think you don't need to avoid monetizing the service. Instead, if the stuff is good and easy to use, your contribution by removing heavy flash cards gives users more convenience.<p>In real life, people help each other as friends. But since we can not help each others as strangers, so we exchange money. When you have money and you really like your service and users, you will put the money into making your service better because now you have resources to hire more people to deal with something that volunteers, users community won't/can't. And you still can have money for yourself to live a good life, and I think they won't mind that and are happy that because you deserve it!<p>Also, you somewhat underestimate the chance that your learning tool is really better than flashcards and help students learn better. Think about this: there are probably around order of 100 millions kids in the world that need to learn English in schools. Maybe 5 millions of them really want to learn English well for their future careers and they will invest their time and money to learn it well. While your contribution to make 5 millions people have a better time in life. They may just buy a set of flash card for $10 for a semesters and throw them away, meanwhile your service is fun and they learn much faster and better. So in order that your server can handle the traffic, you can just price it as the flash cards and see how people take it.<p>Begin of edit:<p>Your product is not Microsoft Windows. You don't force people to use it. You don't bully your competitors. So you should not feel guilty of taking money for your achievement.\nIf you really want someone else to take care of it. Make it open source and see how the world react to it.<p>End of edit.",1217818566

265919,comment,265897,265914,0,0,wheels,,,"Well, it depends on why it's being attacked.  My feeling is that Perl is an under-appreciated tool because it's not cool to like Perl.  In the post I don't really try to defend Perl's actual flaws, which are many, but to point out to an audience that presumably mostly doesn't know Perl, that it can be really useful for some sorts of tasks.",1217818140

But I still had to look around for about 15 seconds before I found what I was looking for.<p>The way that the Craiglist headings are designed is really great, actually.  With large headers you lose vertical separation, and this is especially valuable in visualizing  the ""search | categories | cities"" split.<p>The Craiglist design may not be a happy accident of bad web design.  I think it was done very carefully.",1217817679

I Facebook component to the site would be a great way to get the site out there in front of people, and it would also help with the login issue.

I assume that logging in is only to keep the votes uncontaminated, but you said that you wanted to make this site more fun than statistically valid, and seeing the login requirement was not fun for me.<p>Later impressions:<p>This site has the potential to be an interesting/fun way to spend some time, and if I could A: see the predictions before voting (ie. just being able to browse and see what most people think about a specific subject), and B: not have to log in except maybe to participate in a discussion afterwards, then I would be very likely to use this site as a way to pass some time.<p>Also, a thumbs up for having a ""correct users"" section. I think the possibility of getting the predictions ""right"" and being able to be respected everywhere (on the site) as an accurate predictor is another fun angle that will attract and keep users.<p>Final impressions:<p>This is a startup, and by definition is designed to earn you money. Is there a plan for this in the future? Do you think ads are the way to go, or maybe sell the results to marketing agencies (for targeted subjects and users)?",1217816937

Fun over.<p>I completely understand why you'd want to limit your voting to actual registered users. Nevertheless, I'd try to find a way to let visitors pretend to participate. How about tracking votes by non-registered users in a separate tally? When I click to vote, I get a screen that says ""Thanks for voting!"" and has two sets of results: A ""low-quality"" set that includes all the non-registered user votes for the last 2 hours (or 12 hours, or 24 hours, or -- if there haven't been too many -- the last week) and a ""high-quality"" set that only includes registered users. Next to the registered user data is an explanation (""these are the results that really count"") and a link (""join our site if YOU want to cast votes that really count!"").",1217816301

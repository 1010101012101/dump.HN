As a 25 year old, I'm finding this is true of about half the people I left High School with.<p>Like buying almost anything, it's possible to pay a lot of money but still end up with something crap.<p>The real shame is that kids are not taught to think about education in the same way they they would consider the value of any other purchase.",1337342312

I'm no historian but in this book, people from Soviet states like Lithuania seem to not be considered 'Soviet' in some sense - this term being limited mostly to Russians proper.<p>On the 'innocence' point, I'm talking by Soviet legal standards. People <i>were</i> found guilty of all sorts of ""crimes"" at the time, but many were also never found ""guilty"" of anything and were merely picked up at random to meet labor requirements at the prison camps. In this book, they're split into ""real criminals"" (so murderers, thieves, etc), ""politicals"" (people who were targeted for their political affiliations), and then everyone else, including the innocents or <i>relations</i> of the aforementioned groups.",1337342219

I think it's a cop-out to not get bigger/better laid out offices.<p>Developers need to write code either alone or in pairs. Large places breed interruptions, killing productivity. All these experimental ideas with unassigned offices where anyone uses them when they need to don't work either because people will simply squat on them.<p>If you want your developers to do actual work instead of being distracted, give them individual offices + lots of shared meeting space with whiteboards. This is the gold standard. Anything less (e.g.: n developers per office) will reduce productivity.<p>Here's my formula:<p><pre><code>  productivity = hours_per_week * total_developers * (baseline + (1-baseline)/(avg_developers_per_office^ALPHA))
</code></pre>

I play a lot of 80s games on original hardware, but also (when i'm not at home) on my laptop/ipad/android in emulation. Games I have been playing for almost 30 years are locked solid in my mind; every enemy, path, <i>timing</i> has been set in my brain. I can play those games blindly on original hardware. But not on emulators. For people playing these kind of things for the first time this is not an issue; for me it's not being true to the original. The quirks which were in there are supposed to be in there. Horizontal shooters which had visual/audio issues in the original game because the end boss was actually too big for the poor Z80 + VDP to do fast enough, is now suddenly smooth in the emulator in case you lose the edge of attacking it when the computer is in pain. More fun or not is not the issue here; correct emulation is important to preserve all millions upon millions of carefully crafted assembler instructions on the platform of choice.

And then as you have a family it just goes on and on...<p>So it happened that I went with relative of mine to check out a luxury flat he was about to buy here in Bangalore. As I was checking out the flat with him, he asked me if I would buy if I had the money. And then he asked me to reply with an honest opinion. I paused for a moment and replied... That I would like to buy it now, but I would like to buy it now just because you are buying it. And I'm comparing myself with you, but If I were you and in your shoes then probably I would like to buy what somebody else in your peer group might be buying it. And that might mean a super luxury flat.<p>I realized a simple fact. We are never free. We are always a slave to the question that the author asks <i>Everything will be perfect when .</i><p>We will never be happy because we need money to solve our problems and buy all we want to buy, no amount of it is ever sufficient.

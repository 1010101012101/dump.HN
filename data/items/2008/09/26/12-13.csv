It's not trying to improve Erlang but rather expose Erlang features to those who  don't quite grock Erlang's idioms. Programming languages evolve because someone, perhaps a fashion-conscious fanboy even, took a little from this language and some of that language and mixed them together. You may not agree with the result but it may suit others just fine.",1222433893

I think C++ is a great language, if used with caution, and I will use it right away in projects where C would normally be used. Specially with useful libraries like STL and Boost being available.<p>Most plain C projects are reinventing the wheel many times. Linked lists, hashtables, reference counting, OO with function pointers. I'm sure those projects shrink at least 33% in size when they would be using STL or Boost. I've certainly seen that in my own code.",1222433554

Given how many companies they fund, how much time do they actually spend with each company? How do they scale the model without diluting experience?<p>Most VC's, even poor ones bank on 2/10 paying for the failures, otherwise they go out of business. Has YC provided > 20% success rate - I don't know, I'm asking? How does YC even define success?<p>Sequoia and YC do not have a monopoly on technology success, far from it. There are many thousands of excellent, proven technology investors around the world available to work with.

But he doesn't seem to have much beyond that.<p>He also neglects the point that turning power -> useful work done is more efficient for electricity from a battery, which is pretty relevant. And for fuels, is more efficient in bigger engines/power plants.<p>Wikipedia tells me diesel engines get in the region of 45% efficient, petrol 30%, electric 90%.<p>That's a lot of room for transmission loss.",1222430760
315956,comment,315631,315631,0,0,marvin,,,"This seems to be related to laminary flow separation <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_separation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_separation</a>. The news article doesn't give too many details. Under certain aerodynamic conditions, the airflow separates from the barrier it is flowing around, forming ""bubbles"" of vacuum that increase drag considerably.<p>From what I know of aerodynamics, improvements in when flow separation occurs will not have much impact on fuel consumption. Flow separation only causes increased drag at low speeds. At higher speeds, the phenomenon doesn't occur - the problem at higher speeds is that the airflow remains attached to the surface, but flows turbulently instead of smoothly. The ideal wing has smooth (laminary) flow over the entire surface, without any flow separation. This has thus far been unachievable in practice. For all I know, this new theory might also address this problem, but it hardly seems like a revolution is in the works. We have a decent understanding of these phenomena already. It's more related to statistics than engineering.<p>The point with the rugged surface of golf balls (or turbulators on airplanes) is to force the laminary air flow to become turbulent. Flow separation only occurs when the airflow is smooth. So we accept an increase in drag to prevent an even bigger increase in drag.<p>Perhaps we could improve the aerodynamics of cars (cars move at low speeds), but I doubt that flow separation is the main barrier to better fuel efficiency here.",1222430721

If you are finding progression at work slow and thinking of another job, think before you leap. Probably the most important thing to remember is like booms, recessions end.<p><i>""...

6878734,comment,6875842,6875842,1,0,analog31,,,"In my view, the impact of the President&#x27;s message will not be on those of us who are already teaching our kids programming, but on the kids who live on the other side of the digital divide, and have nobody around them -- parents and even teachers -- who are fully aware of what programming consists of. Many parents think that programming is dangerous.<p>I agree with the folks who have suggested that something like a semester of C randomly inserted into the existing curriculum will be a waste. Instead, the &quot;every American should learn code&quot; message should stimulate debate about what &quot;code&quot; would actually consist of if applied intelligently to the K-12 curriculum.<p>How about music class? So much of contemporary music is programmed. Create music in Scratch.<p>Replace some obsolete math exercises with explorations using spreadsheets or computer algebra software.<p>Let kids use Scratch to write their own data acquisition programs for science labs, via S4A.",1386644270

6878713,comment,6875842,6877654,5,0,mediaman,,,"Besides what others have mentioned with respect to helping people discover an otherwise undiscovered talent for engineering, coding, if only at a more basic level, has a tremendous impact on average office workers&#x27; productivity.<p>Consider a company I am intimately familiar with, which is a typical manufacturing company. There are accountants, customer service, salespeople, production schedulers, marketers, inventory managers, production foreman, maintenance technicians, material buyers, human resource staffers, and so on. A typical set of functions that could have been picked from any number of hundreds of small or medium sized manufacturing companies. Due to the company&#x27;s size there are no dedicated programmers as might be found in a larger company&#x27;s IS or IT department.<p>But in nearly all work areas, a person&#x27;s productivity is greatly leveraged to their familiarity and comfort with technology, including the ability to develop a set of instructions to assist in automating tasks within the computer. And because their productivity is leveraged to technology, those who are more capable with that automation are typically also paid more.<p>It is surprising how many opportunities there are for at least basic levels of programming in many different areas. Consider the following examples:<p>- A material buyer needs to know anticipated raw material needs by product, based on order backlogs. She develops a little VB script to tell her how much to order of each type of raw material, based on types of products in the order backlog. She then enhances it to consider price discounts, shipping quantity breaks, supplier lead times, and additional factors, to maximize material inventory turns while minimizing the material outages.<p>- An accountant develops a basic script to assist in forecasting cash flow to the business, to help manage the company&#x27;s operating line of credit, lowering the business&#x27;s interest costs and identifying potential cash flow issues well ahead of time.<p>- A maintenance tech develops a database to track issues with machines, replacing paper tracking. After six months, he uses database queries to begin identifying patterns among the hundreds of maintenance issues, to help create a set of preventative maintenance procedures to minimize expensive downtime.<p>Are any of these using Ruby on Rails? Are they using algorithms that one would learn in a Computer Science curriculum? Likely not. Many of these tasks are on the wrong side of what the audience here would even consider &quot;coding&quot;: it is just creating a simple database, or using some simple VBS, or maybe even nothing more than some more complex than usual formulas in Excel. And yet they are skills that are woefully absent from the vast majority of the population, and yet which would greatly enhance their productivity and earnings.<p>Would the majority of workers benefit from formal training of computer science theory? That is debatable. If done the way many CS 101 classes are done, it could even hurt, by creating fear of the topic at an early age.<p>But there is a basic level of competence that would enhance the productivity of a great many number of workers, that is absent today. That basic level of competence would include the introduction of how a database works, basic office automation scripts, perhaps mixed in with some fundamentals of simple data analysis with computers.<p>A typical office or production candidate demonstrating even these simple skills is highly attractive in an interview, and I believe that any country&#x27;s industry would be far more competitive with a population with these skills than without.",1386643973

There is powerful emotional energy to be harnessed, but a lot of us (maybe just me, but clearly others too) have no idea how to manipulate it effectively, so we typically go without it.

Clearly this is a broader human problem- our inability to contextualize things, to see the bigger broader picture except when it&#x27;s too late, or when we&#x27;re unexpectedly inspired.<p>Is meditation the solution?

Sure enough, that post not only dropped off the first page (a first page which contained month-old submissions), but it was effectively banished from the “Hot” ranking entirely. I felt bad and removed my downvote, but that post never really recovered...<p>While testing, I noticed a number of odd phenomena surounding Reddit’s vote scores. Scores would often fluctuate each time I refreshed the page, even on old posts in low-activity subreddits. I suspect they have something more going on, perhaps at the infrastructure level – a load balancer, perhaps, or caching issues.&quot;<p>This is partially due to vote fuzzing. More to the point, votes go into a queue and the removal of the downvote might not cancel out the previous action for some time.<p>As a result, this suggested flaw will supposedly let somebody successfully snipe puffins from the new page of a small sized birdwatching subreddit before they ever get a fair shake. I think if somebody would attempt this sort of manipulation further they would find it an ineffective strategy, there have been (probably constantly are) attempts to game Reddit before and this seems like an excellent honeypot.<p>Beyond the narrow set of circumstances during a very small time window the flaw disappears, yet if you try to abuse this you&#x27;ll stick out like a sore thumb.<p>The true horror expressed in the OP is that the ordering of posts in the purgatory is not strictly logical - the post ranked 10042 should really be ranked 10041.

It has advantages like stabilising the economy and encouraging investment. I&#x27;ve never heard a serious economist suggest that moderate inflation is anything but good for the economy, and I&#x27;ve heard plenty tell me why deflation is dangerous.<p>Inflation is important because economics is all about creating incentives. We have property rights because it gives people an incentive to work hard and takes risks. We have patents because they give people an incentive to explain how their invention works. We have a market economy because it means that if a company wants to gain market share, it has to create value for the consumer. In the same way, central banks try to maintain low levels of inflation (~3%) because it encourages people to invest their money in profitable ventures, rather than just leaving it under the mattress. Investment is the way wealth is created, so it should be pretty obvious that deflation is bad for the economy.<p>Notice that I&#x27;m talking about the economic health of the country, not the individual citizen. If you&#x27;re only concerned about immediate short term benefits, you should push for zero taxes, high deflation, and the gold standard. But that&#x27;s penny wise and pound foolish.

Of course M1 is an approximation, but that&#x27;s how science is done. You get to understand how your model behaves, and you may say &quot;Well, X is a bit higher than it should be, but that&#x27;s because M1 assumes a linear response, and we know that&#x27;s not quite true&quot;.<p>Bayesian model averaging entails P(X) = P(X|M1)P(M1) + P(X|M2)P(M2). It assumes that either M1 or M2 is true. No conclusions can be derived from that. It might be useful from a purely predictive standpoint (<i>maybe</i>) , but it has no place inside the scientific pipeline.<p>There is a related quantity which is P(M1)/P(M2). That&#x27;s how much the data favours M1 over M2, and it&#x27;s a sensible formula, because it doesn&#x27;t rely on the abominable P(M1) + P(M2) = 1",1386641622

Learning programming is basically a battle to simply keep putting your face in front of the code.

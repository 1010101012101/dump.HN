The other day, I was watching the Martha Stewart show, don't ask why, and she mentioned her Twitter account, asked how many had an account, and encouraged all who did and didn't to follow her. This morning I'm watching the Today show, and one of the anchors mentions Twitter and how it's blowing up. This, on top of the fact that many big time celebrities are using the service, has definitely convinced me that Twitter is here to stay, at the very least, as a wildly successful media tool.",1237431548

The regulations that handled this have been dismantled over the years.<p>As I pointed out in another thread, AIG's assets have not had losses and the relevant regulations have not been dismantled over the years.  (In fact, AIG had to register as a bank because of new regulations.)<p>What happened to AIG is that the mark-to-market for those assets, which are behaving exactly as predicted, went away.  (AIG's portfolios are not taking a foreclosure hit because they cherry-picked.)  That took AIG's credit rating down and then the covenants kicked in, requiring AIG to pay money that it didn't have.",1237431474

522775,comment,522307,522676,0,0,seekely,,,"From my experience, Google's customer support for it's paid Google Apps could use a ton of improvement,to the point where I think it is a significant weakness exploitable by companies with similar paid services and better support.  They are really difficult to contact and their support navigation always frustratingly leads you to one of their help pages instead of a number or email address to use.  And if the problem is not a service outage/emergency, you must go through email which takes days to get the typical generic and unhelpful response.<p>I love all of Google's services, but I am/was incredibly frustrated that we actually paid to use their services and then they left us out in the cold when it came to a shortcoming of their infrastructure.  We started with a domain for Google Apps and purchased 6 accounts on the domain.  A year or so into using their service, we realized we needed to switch our primary domain from ourhabit.com to habitindustries.com.  Both the domains are owned by us, and habitindustries.com was at the time setup as an alias on our ourhabit.com domain. Turns out, Google Apps does not support the switch.  And not only do they not support it, there is no migration help  to move emails or remove the risk of losing email while you transfer over to the new primary domain.  And the real kicker? They made us pay for all 6 accounts again on the new primary domain even though we would no longer would be using the old account. If you aren't going to support a basic feature (which is called for again and again and again on their forums), don't make us shell out another $50 per user to mitigate it.  Thank god we only had 6 users at the time.<p>Sorry for the rant, but seeing the claim of 24/7 customer support really set me off :)",1237431413

If I found that someone I knew had such an interest, I'd probably never speak to them again. If I had kids, I'd keep them the hell away from such a pervert. But <i>illegal</i>? For having copied some files, but having had nothing to do with the crime involved in their original creation? Those pictures are depictions and records of a crime, but they do not embody it.<p>The whole concept is ludicrous and I can't believe I am so alone in pointing that out. If you have a picture of a murder, and I copy it, we haven't somehow created another murder out of the ether. If I possess a picture of someone doing illegal drugs, I don't magically become partially responsible for the drug use. I think a reasonable person would agree up to here with everything I said. So why does all rationality fly straight out the window when it comes to a crime that happens to involve a child? The arguments weren't valid before, but change the subject to an emotionally charged topic and suddenly they make perfect sense?<p>I just don't buy it. You can't cut and paste pictures of crime, and in doing so create more crime. You can't create more crime by viewing a recording of crime. I am utterly baffled why anyone would argue otherwise.",1237431380

522766,comment,522728,522728,0,0,jerf,,,"I disagree strongly with making ""security"" step 4. By the time you finally get around to making the app functional you may have fallen into several fundamental traps that require massive work to get out of the hole.<p>The vast, vast bulk of security holes are due to simple things that are easier to get right even in the prototype stage than to retrofit later. Concatenating strings into an SQL statement is <i>harder</i> than using a proper library for escaping. Properly escaping HTML isn't that hard if you know what you are doing <i>and</i> plan for it in advance, but is hell to go back and fix later. Buffer overflows are easy to avoid today by using secure libraries or languages in the first place but can be very difficult to fix in an audit phase. Even things like implementing a basic role/capability system are a lot, lot easier to implement from the beginning than to try to retrofit, and they are not hard. If you have some experience and know what you are doing frequently the right way has been made easier than the wrong way anyhow.<p>If you are still at an experience level where you still have to think about how to properly encode an SQL query value... well, charge forward I suppose, but I promise you, you will pay. There's no way around that.<p>Concerns with a similar pattern: Handling string encoding. You will come out ahead if you start out aware of how encoding works and how to handle it, rather than trying to retrofit it later. Internationalization: If you know what you are doing, it is not significantly harder to do at least basic internationalization first (a string table instead of typing a raw string, with a bit of work you can make it an emacs macro so it costs one whole extra keystroke per string), and retrofitting it is extremely hard. If you encounter one particularly hard string, label it in a comment and bail if you're in a hurry, but you're still ahead for having thought about it and having everything else set up properly.<p>If you feel you should object to my point by saying ""But those things are too hard!"", you're missing my point. For someone with decent experience, they <i>shouldn't</i> be. I don't have to think too hard about any of these things even in my prototypes. (Except encoding, which is hard to think about because it's a hard problem, even for a prototype, unless you are blessed to be working in an environment that has a sane encoding story.)",1237431011

522761,comment,520836,522650,0,0,unalone,,,"I have an undying dislike for standardization, because it's what influenced my application decisions and I'm not very happy where I am. So there's definitely some bias.<p>That said, I (and a few students in my college who were in the same situation as me) had a very, very low grade point average considering I wanted to apply to snooty upper class schools. (A 3.1 unweighted means you have a hard-as-hell time getting into any of the really elite places.) Beyond that, many colleges wanted SAT 2s, and I bluntly refused to take any more standardized tests senior year. I was sick and fed up with taking tests just to place into schools. I still think it's a terrible system that wastes students' time for the sake of assigning a number. And so I, and many other extremely bright and talented kids, ended up merely going to a good public school, hoping that it would be what we wanted out of college. As it turns out, a lot of us are dissatisfied. And it annoys me that a lot of kids that aren't as comparatively bright as that tiny group got into much more prestigious schools, because while we were doing our own things (one kid went to Colombia senior year to do work with their science labs, another was a multiintrumentalist in a variety of different-genre bands, so on and so forth), other kids were spending every minute of the day studying and looking for ways to peak out their GPA. The kids who were cramped and rebellious and spent their time going their own way as decisively as possible almost all wound up at public schools (the musician went to Rutgers, the scientist went to Penn State, I and a few artist/musicians went to TCNJ), and while the schools we're at aren't <i>bad</i>, they're certainly mediocre compared to what the best schools have to offer. We wound up there because we hated the useless, monotonous system and so our scores were lower and while I think if I could do it again, I'd make sure to do better in school - it would have been worth the tedium - I hate that that's the choice, either play to a really shitty system or get subpar results. So in my mind I imagine a system that focuses exclusively on finding those exceptions to the rules.",1237430573

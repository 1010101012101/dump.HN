The data structures do not have to be mutable. It&#x27;s a trade-off, of course, because you can&#x27;t pass somebody just part of a data structure (like a sub-map) and have them mutate it there, but I think Clojure has shown that in practice this isn&#x27;t really much of a loss.",1410047390

Ideally, good object-oriented code should always prefer immutability over mutability, should prefer interface polymorphism over inheritance polymorphism, should prefer has-a relationships (the OO version of composition) over is-a relationships (subclassing), and so on.  Much of this was originally figured out a very long time ago.<p>So the issue isn&#x27;t that these standards don&#x27;t exist; it&#x27;s that they aren&#x27;t widely understood among users of object-oriented languages.  That, in turn, is because OO is so widely used by so many programmers, including a lot of people with very limited formal training in computer science, that most users of OO languages have very little exposure to any of the literature about what constitutes well-crafted object-oriented code.  Certainly less so than in FP, which benefits (in this department) from the fact that it hadn&#x27;t even begun to escape the ivory tower in any sort of serious way until just a few short years ago.  In short, object-oriented programming is a victim of its own success.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that the first really widespread object-oriented language wasn&#x27;t particularly object-oriented, either.",1410046742

8279861,comment,8279370,8279573,4,0,byuu,,,"I&#x27;ve been quite disillusioned with C++ myself as of late. I am currently writing a wrapper class around shared pointers to objects with inheritance (which embed their own private implementations, which also utilize inheritance) so that I can pass them by value and use operator. for method chaining. The SFINAE used for construction from base objects to these shared pointer wrappers is something out of the ninth circle of hell.<p><pre><code>    template<typename T> struct Shared : std::shared_ptr<T> {\n      template<typename U> struct is_compatible {\n        typedef char yes[1], no[0];\n\n        template<typename V> static yes& test1(typename std::enable_if<std::is_base_of<std::shared_ptr<T>, V>::value>::type*);\n        template<typename V> static no& test1(...);\n\n        template<typename V> static yes& test2(typename std::enable_if<std::is_base_of<element_type, typename V::element_type>::value>::type*);\n        template<typename V> static no& test2(...);\n\n        static constexpr bool value = sizeof(test1<U>(0)) == sizeof(yes) || sizeof(test2<U>(0)) == sizeof(yes);\n      };\n</code></pre>\nAnd from the function binder:<p><pre><code>      //value = true if R L::operator()(P...) exists\n      template<typename L> struct compatible {\n        template<typename T> static constexpr typename std::is_same<R, decltype(std::declval<T>().operator()(std::declval<P>()...))>::type exists(T*);\n        template<typename T> static constexpr std::false_type exists(...);\n        static constexpr bool value = decltype(exists<L>(0))::value;\n      };\n      template<typename L> function(const L& object, typename std::enable_if<compatible<L>::value>::type* = nullptr) { callback = new lambda<L>(object); }\n</code></pre>\nAnd yet ... when actually <i>using</i> the library, it is a thing of beauty.<p><pre><code>    struct TextEditor : Window {\n      MenuBar menuBar = {this};\n        Menu menuFile = {&menuBar, &quot;File&quot;};\n          MenuItem menuQuit = {&menuFile, &quot;Quit&quot;};\n    \n      VerticalLayout layout = {this};\n        TextEdit editor = {&layout, Size{~0, ~0}};\n    \n      TextEditor() {\n        StatusBar statusBar{this};\n        statusBar.setFont(Font::sans(8, &quot;Bold&quot;)).setText(&quot;Line 1, Column 1&quot;);\n\n        HorizontalLayout findBar(&layout);\n        findBar.append(Label(&findBar, &quot;Find:&quot;));\n        findBar.append(LineEdit(&findBar).setBackgroundColor(Color::Yellow)\n        .onChange([&] { searchFor(text()); }));\n        findBar.append(Button(&findBar, &quot;Clear&quot;)\n        .onActivate([&] { findBar.widget(1).setText(&quot;&quot;); }));\n    \n        menuQuit.onActivate(&Application::quit);\n        edit.onChange([&] { updateStatusBar(); });\n      }\n    };\n</code></pre>\nThere is no need for any memory management, or any usage of pointers. We build UIs, and everything gets automatically released safely when nothing is referring to it anymore. We can declare named objects that we can use later, or we can create dynamic objects and pop them right inside of other objects. We can destroy and unparent things whenever we want. And it&#x27;s deterministic, reference-counted GC. No pauses for a tracer. No dynamic typing anywhere, all errors are at compile-time.<p>I highly suspect that C++ is unreasonably complicated and that all of this rvalue-reference, variadic template, meta-programming, dynamic-casting polymorphism, is all just voodoo that isn&#x27;t applicable to general programming. And yet, being able to do it gives me amazing expressive power to write awesome libraries that I could never hope to accomplish in another language.<p>Until I find a language that&#x27;s even in the same ballpark as C++ in terms of performance, and offers similar expressiveness, it really doesn&#x27;t even matter how bad C++ can be for library authors. There&#x27;s no other viable option right now. D is the closest we have, but its complexity already rivals, if not exceeds, that of C++.",1410046343

It's actually the law for Apple to make as much money as possible given any legal and ethical way it can.  Suing another giant tech company over legitimate patents is ethical.  The system is designed so that a trial determines if the patents are legit.  This is what happened.  If you don't like that, then fix the fucking patent system.  Quit whining that your favourite tech company lost.<p>Companies are not teams, they are simply the manufacturer of a product that you either bought or chose not to buy.  If you don't like the way a company is legally and ethically running it's business, then change the law.  Don't boycott the company who is succeeding best at working within the framework provided.",1346507998

The default method of installing applications on Windows and Mac is to download an executable from the internet and run it as Administrator. The default method of installing applications on Linux is to get them from the package manager, and binaries downloaded from the internet don't have the execute bit set by default.<p>I don't mean to say that Linux is totally immune from malicious software, but it's a much harder target. You're in the position of having to either get malicious software into the repositories, convince users to do something arcane and atypical with binaries downloaded from the internet, or exploit security vulnerabilities in installed software on an OS with a package manager that auto-updates everything to the latest patch on a regular basis. None of those is anywhere near as easy as ""click here to see Anna Kournikova naked"" or exploiting known Java vulnerabilities that Apple was kind enough to leave unpatched for like a year.",1346507996

4463660,comment,4463526,4463624,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"I don't actually agree with that. Capitalism is ruthless. The winners <i>do</i> put the losers out of business. That's the moral justification for IP: without regulatory intervention, the winners are often not the generators of the IP. That has become more true in the age of the Internet, where a lot of natural monopolies are emerging, but it was probably always true. Size begets growth, coalition-building is inevitable (leading to conglomerates) and those who can't make nice with the big players often get crushed.<p>The problem with capitalism is that it's not stable. People who become rich and powerful (and their generally useless heirs, friends, and hired-gun managers) don't actually want to live in a capitalist world, so they use their social connections to build a private safety net, which hampers innovation. Corporate bureaucracies have more in common with the Kremlin than a Silicon Valley startup, and even Silicon Valley isn't <i>that</i> innovative, because it's increasingly controlled by a well-connected VC/media social elite. Most people wouldn't want to live in pure capitalism, and the corporate elite especially doesn't want it. They want to keep what they've got.<p>The problem with the problem with capitalism (or the problem with not-capitalism) is that every alternative to an at least mostly capitalistic economy is terrible. Command economies are not desirable.<p>Most thinking people are essentially (small-l) libertarian. My use of this word has nothing to do with the current usage (conservative who likes pot). By libertarian, I mean the opposite of authoritarian: belief that people should, all else being equal, be free to do as they wish rather than controlled by a governmental or corporate authority. (Authoritarians believe it's intrinsically impossible for most people to do anything good unless told to do so by a central authority.) The problem is that libertarianism begets capitalism begets conglomeration begets corporatism. It's the Iron Law of Oligarchy. The only solution I can see is the Western European social democracy (i.e. a socialist infrastructure to provide a safety net, but a capitalist engine for innovation and to maintain individual freedom). You need enough of a welfare state to keep people from being exploited by emergent corporate power, but enough capitalism (economic freedom) to keep innovation alive.",1346507745

Information is one of these things. Information is a means to a lot of other ends as well.<p>I look dimly on people who say ""Capitalism is driven by X"" where X is some narrowly defined band of things. From Rand to Marx, theories that look like invariably turn out wrong, sometimes disastrously so. In economic speak, an incentive is anything that a person in question might want. The desire to acquire information and the rewards of using it are one kind of incentive. It's common for random econ pundits to try to redefine ""incentive"" as ""greed"", and this should be the first clue that they either don't know or don't care what economists actually think.",1346507407

4463632,comment,4463526,4463526,12,0,michaelochurch,,,"Capitalism has its problems, but its critical selling point is that, if it works well, you don't need official approval to do business. In the USSR, it was a crime to compete with the one established business: the state. Fusions of state and business power (whether from the left, as in communism, or from the right, as in fascism) are almost always bad. The major win (practical and moral) in capitalism is the right of the individual to interact with the market without official approval.<p>If you look at corporate hierarchies, however, you see that they're run internally like command economies. Headcounts and projects are written up and assigned by gloomy, bureaucratic committees detached from the actual heartbeat of the business. You're assigned a role, and if you try to ""compete"" by seeking a different role or starting a skunk-works project, most companies will fire you or otherwise work to shut you down. Companies are statist in the extreme.<p>Corporatism is a system designed to give the best of both systems (capitalism and socialism) for a well-connected, parasitic social elite (called ""the 1 percent"", but really they're about 0.2%) and the worst of both for everyone else. You see this, for example, in commercial air travel, where you get Soviet quality of service but the bizarre, unpredictable pricing you'd expect from a runaway market (that is actually not so much a ""market"" as an algorithm designed to fuck you over).",1346506812

He did very well in all of these, was not ""fast tracked"" to anywhere, and tried, on his own, to enter university more than 1 year early. This failed, largely because French was not a strong subject for him. He studied it in Munich, where it was a lot less important than in multi-lingual Switzerland. After half a year of schooling in Switzerland, he passed the university entrance exams with flying colors, both in sciences and humanities.

This could be far more exciting than all the low cost FDM (fused deposition modeling) 3D printers like the rep-rap. It could achieve a far higher resolution than similar priced machines.<p>The only potential drawback of SLA at this price point is the cost of the resin. The FDM machines use very low cost ABS plastic wire, the resin for an SLA machine could be quite expensive. It will be interesting to see what resin they have gone with and if they have found a relay cheap one to use.<p>Very exciting!<p>Formlabs website: <a href=""http://www.formlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.formlabs.com/</a>",1348480757

4563923,comment,4562912,4563675,1,0,josephlord,,,"Apple may not be positioned to harm Google massively but I don't see that is really their aim.<p>Google clearly has done and still does some real useful innovation but I think that you are massively overstating their effectiveness on that front.<p>What is innovative about Google TV?  The first version was a shit concept implemented badly and advertised by lunatics.  I understand the second version is better but I still don't think the concept is right (I've not used the second version so it may be quite good now).<p>Android?  I'm not saying that it isn't good or doesn't have some innovations but it isn't in a different class to iOS or even probably WinPhone.  Can you explain what is really innovative about it.<p>Wearable computing - toy so far. Do I think that it will be turned into a mass market product in the next 5 years.  My bet is no.  Also IF Apple was working on such a thing they wouldn't tell the world until it was consumer ready so there isn't necessarily a lead.<p>On line advertising, peta byte scale data analytics - these are tools used against me as a customer (or am I the product).  They are the reasons that I don't use Gmail or want an Android phone.  Do I trust Google more than FB - hell yes!  But they know too much already from my search patterns, maps use etc.  I don't want to give them any more.<p>I could go down the rest of your list but it would get tedious.<p>It also seems to me that cult going gaga these days isn't the Apple one but the Google one.  There is far more vitriol, anger and negative comments about Apple products than raving praise for them.  Your post is not in that category but it shows what I perceive as an unhealthy level of reverence to Google.",1348480700

You can't require 5 years of experience in a technology that's only 4 years old.  You can't require 5 years of experience in a dozen different things.  I won't speculate on the reasons behind these inflated requirements, but they are definitely inflated.<p>Also, you can't take a set of requirements and carbon copy it for all of your positions.  The difference between a junior position and a senior position should be more than just a year of experience.  Likewise, the requirements for positions like architect, developer, and tester should not be identical except for ""architecting"", ""developing"", and ""testing"".<p>In the end, though, you should view job postings and resumes as a very weak filter.  People are going to lie, from small tweaks to outright falsifications, and you're going to have to use other means to weed the liars out.  Interviews, training, and probation are going to be your tools here, and no amount of inflated requirements or expectations of ""professional honesty"" are going to change that.",1348480663

If you get an exception you didn't prepare for, your code fails, not silently but very loudly. The argument to have is whether this is better or worse than your code silently continuing to do all the next steps even though the first one failed.<p>(FWIW I agree with the article, but will say it's kind of surprising to see that point of view from a python programmer given the python approach to type-checking)",1348480199

I tend to use one or the other depending on the task at hand. They're both of good ""pedigree"", xdebug has been around now for about 10 years I think and so has a good amount of history behind it, and XHProf which XHGui is based on was developed by Facebook and used against their code base which is probably somewhat larger than yours (though hopefully better written!). At then end of the day they're both pretty easy to get up and running (and of course they're free), so I would suggest giving them both a test run and see which you prefer the feel of and which better suits your needs in terms of the information it gives you for your task. Given that you look like you will need all the help you can get, you might even end up using multiple tools like this to get as much insight into the code as you can. If you do, be aware that they can often interfere with each other (or so I've read, I've never tried those two on the same code base at the same time) so you might need to deploy them on separate virtualised but identical environments with the same code.<p>Edit: Just to say, I usually use XHGui for profiling existing code and code in production, and xdebug for profiling <i>changes</i> to code and code under development. But thats just because thats how the tools ""feel"" right to me, and there's no reason why you can't do both with both.",1348480015

E.g. my previous^2 job was essentially a message-processing system; it had a bunch of loops that took messages off queues and processed them one at a time. If processing any given message threw an (uncaught) exception, it marked that message for retry or as failed and carried on.<p>You could certainly argue for handling each message in a separate process a la erlang, but this approach worked well for us.<p>I think <i>checked</i> exceptions were a mistake (IIRC Gosling agrees), and Java could do with better support for multiple return values (which exceptions get abused for), but I like Java-style runtime exceptions.",1348479787

Perhaps someone should have corrected me when I first misexplained it in my blog 3 months ago (<a href=""http://groovy.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Blog02#13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groovy.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Blog02#13</a>).<p>There are, however, other issues that go back much longer. During 2006-2008 I wasn't welcomed but instead ignored then ridiculed by many in the Groovy community. Besides the public stuff, there was much more through back-channels, which appeared to be instigated by the project managers. Regarding Groovy++ and static compilation, I started building ""GRegexes"" atop it so had a stake in its success. So when in July last year, those project managers started a parallel project under VMware control to do the same, it looked like they were again squashing anything not under their own umbrella, despite advertising API transformation hooks allowing others to independently plug their own functionality into (Codehaus) Groovy. I started speaking out publically about their behavior then. Not wanting to give up on Groovy, I started building a version atop Clojure around December last year. Lo and behold, within a week after 8 years of neglecting JSR-241, the Groovy project manager starts writing a tool to generate a ""TCK"" from the Codehaus Groovy tests, from which he intends to generate a ""spec"" automatically. Whatever tests the current version of the Codehaus implementation of Groovy happens to pass at the time becomes the latest version of the ""spec"". Any changes to the ""spec"" will effectively be discussions on the Codehaus mailing list and Jira issues.<p>After all this it looks like VMware don't really want anything related to Groovy that's not under their own direct control. Other languages <i>embrace the anarchy</i>: Perl has CPAN, and v6 has a spec with different implementations. Ruby has gems and an ISO spec with many implementations, and Rails was built <i>outside</i> Matz's control afaik by 37signals. Haskell has Hackage and a spec with many implementations, but the VMware project managers seem to be discouraging independent development like Groovy++ and GRegexes, and even stonewalling regarding a spec. I have only respect for your contributions to Groovy, as well as those of Cedric, Paul, Jeremy, and others I don't know about, but I have a lot of mistrust with the non-technical overlords at VMware. Perhaps that was how I misread what they said about the two jars in Groovy 2.",1348478250

4563836,comment,4561973,4562349,1,0,6ren,,,"A subtle advantage of static typing is documentation: you can see what kinds of arguments are required.  This can also be used in auto-generated documentation, creating hyper-links to the type and implementations. (I noticed this in python docs vs. javadocs.)<p>There's an old question: which benefits of static typing are needed - and are they worth it? (to the extent that static typed languages are successful).  Performance is obviously important.  But if dynamically typed languages were <i>fast enough</i> for most needs, would the bulk of users switch to them? (note: it doesn't matter if static typing is faster still, just that dynamic typing is fast enough.)<p>Would it follow the long-term trend, of performance being traded for developer productivity? The real question behind this being whether dynamic typing actually increases developer productivity (and if so, for which tasks).  Obviously, dynamic typing requires fewer keystrokes, less up-front design, and is more flexible (when iterating lean/agile).  But static typing prevents some bugs, aids documentation, and helps manage projects as they increase in size.<p>However, this may be moot. We're no longer getting the long-term increases in single-core performance, so this trade-off may no longer apply.  And, note: we do actually have <i>some</i> excess performance, and what has happened is in some cases it is absorbed by dynamic languages (python/ruby on serverside), and it is used to create smaller computers, lower performance, using less wattage (smartphones/tablets). iPhones use objective-c, androids use a java variant.<p>Maybe we've reached a point of equilibrium in the trade-off, if we include the end-user's demands?<p>BTW: I'm personally at home with stating typing, but I can't remember the last time it prevented a bug for me. (other people using it in others ways might have different experiences).<p>PS: to give another answer to your question: Flash's ActionScript 3.0. It's javascript plus optional static typing.

They're just a different mechanism for communicating failures across function calls. You can code with exceptions the same way you do with errors.<p>Really the two styles of error communication are very similar. The default behavior for exceptions is to abort and let the parent deal with it, but you have the option of continuing on instead (catch). The default behavior for returned errors is to keep going, but you have the option of aborting and informing the caller. In either case you have to examine the code you're calling or its documentation to find out the details of what could happen when things go wrong.<p>Exceptions have the advantage of the abort-behavior requiring zero code, but it may be less obvious to beginners what is going on. In either case, people just don't like to be surprised, so they prefer what is familiar.<p>In C#, which has Tasks for concurrency (very similar to goroutines), an uncaught exception in a Task will bring down the entire program at some non-deterministic time, unless you make sure to observe it somewhere. So generally you're using some extension method so that invoking doSomething() in a Task looks like:<p><pre><code>  Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { doSomething(); }).OnException((ex) => { /*log it*/ });\n</code></pre>\nEither that or you just make sure to catch anything at the root of your Task block.",1348478026

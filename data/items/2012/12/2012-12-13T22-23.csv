Apple could certainly have improved its existing Maps app if they were willing to play ball with Google.<p>You speak like you have authoritative information on the negotiations between Apple and Google on maps. Your comment could be taken seriously if you backed it up with sources, instead of dressing up your personal opinion to sound like a fact.",1355439597

4918618,comment,4918038,4918350,5,0,rayiner,,,"> But the demand for lawyers is completely cultural.<p>I don't think that's the case. People think that the U.S. has a lot of lawyers because we're a ""litigious society"" but I've never seen evidence suggesting that Americans are more likely to sue than other sorts of people.<p>I think the demand for lawyers is more structural than anything else, and there are a lot of dimensions to this. First, the amount of conflict rises proportionally with the number of interactions between people. This means larger societies have more (superlinearly more) conflict than smaller ones, more active economies have more conflict than less active ones, and heterogenous societies have more conflict than homogenous ones.<p>Second, different countries use different mechanisms to accomplish the same tasks. The U.S. is at one extreme--we use private litigation to handle things like employer/employee disputes that might in other countries be handled by a complaint to some sort of board. Litigation is, by design, the way to challenge most government action. In the regulatory regime, we skimp on government enforcement of things like financial or enviromental laws, and write in ""citizen suit provisions"" to allow private enforcement.<p>Third, the demand for lawyers depends on the structure of the economy. An economy based on financial services, which can result in expensive and complex disputes, needs many more lawyers than one based on agriculture.<p>Fourth, the number of lawyers in a country isn't directly proportional to the amount of conflict within the country itself. A country that hosts numerous multi-national corporations will have many lawyers working on disputes that actually arise in other countries. Moreover, a country with a sophisticated legal system will be asked to resolve disputes that only have a tenuous connection to the country. The U.S. is also a net exporter of legal services, in conjunction with its export of financial services. American firms do work for Brazilian companies doing IPOs in Brazilian markets. The reverse is never true.<p>An example of an (industrialized) country that has 1/10 as many lawyers per capita as the US is Finland. Can you compare the US with Finland? The US has 133 Fortune Global 500 companies, Finland has 1. The US has 9 cities as large or larger than Finland. The U.S. is extremely heterogenous. Finland is extremely homogenous. The US has to alter its laws to limit the number of foreign cases coming into New York City's courts (a city 4x as large as Finland). An American (or sometimes UK) firm is involved in some way in nearly every major IPO that happens in one of the world's large financial markets. How many Finnish firms are involved in American IPO's? Etc.",1355439566

Because those millions of users have all been trained to expect to enjoy the service for free.

4918599,comment,4916629,4918079,2,0,shawn-butler,,,"You are conflating ethics with morality and choice/action with effect.<p>The question posed was why do Bad things happen to good people?  You noted that, from I assume a scientific perspective, bad things are just often random occurrences that people artifically label as ""bad.""  My response is that Bad things are not random and result from a deviation from the natural order and that our sense of that wrongness from those deviations is not supernatural.<p>To put it in a more realistic scenario  (I only used torture previously because even non-human species have been shown to avoid and punish torture).  Let's say I begin to suffer from chronic dehabilitating headaches and these headaches force me to stop doing the charity work I have done all my life and I become depressed to the point of contemplating suicide.  I have no family history, genetic disposition, history of drug abuse etc.  What I did do was build a house in 2002 that used imported drywall from China containing volatile chemicals that have been emitting sulfurous gases, carbon disulfide, carbonyl sulfide, and hydrogen sulfide which have been absorbed into my body altering my chemical makeup ever since.<p>Is it by a random path that those molecules found their way into my body?  Or is it a result of the actions of people disregarding their sense of wrongness?  Yes.  Am I also free from fault?  No.  Because I am part of and have benefitted directly from a culture that values paying the least at any cost and doesn't properly price environmental damage/costs into the marketplace.  I could have built my house smaller for example paying a higher price for building materials.<p>I could speak to your other example of discrimination by sexual orientation in the context of natural law, but I would face immediate downvotes and this isn't really the place for that discussion.<p>We will just have to agree to disagree that human ethics hasn't really progressed that much in the last few thousand years.  Natural law persists but what humans value obviously alters over time.  That is, how strictly a culture decides to punish acts of torture of animals is a reflection of the culture, not evidence of its wrongness or the nature of the act.  Personally, I believe that the slower rate of progress in removing Bad things from happening is largely that say unlike physics or chemistry, there is no way to improve the pedagogy of morality.  With the introduction of mathematics and the creation of a universal language for scientific understanding progress at a remarkably faster rate was achieved in the last few hundred years because it is easily transmitted between generations.  The only way moral education is imparted from generation to generation is by example.  You can't educate morality beyond telling stories and parables and living by example so positive changes more in accord with natural order are limited in scope by time and geography.<p>I think if you surveyed those people who justify torture in our time if torturing their children was wrong, you would find overwhelmingly that that they would say it was, but that they believe they have a right or should be able to do it to ""others"" based on some circumstance (such as they did some other Bad act).  Doesn't mean they know that the act of torture is any less contrary to the natural order or that it won't have consequences as a result, just that they are choosing to value something else greater (and, wrongly I might add).  Similarly if you asked someone eating an omelette how it tasted before and after you gave them the experience of the conditions in a factory chicken farm, you would generally get a very different response.  It has been shown actually to alter the perception of the taste of food in subjects and induces disgust, that is how tuned to the natural order humans are.",1355439227

Anyway, I talk about my original aims for the project in some other comments.<p>Based on the dozens (at least) of papers published each year that use twitter data, I'm pretty sure it's kosher to use public posts. You might want to double check with your irb though.

While easier divorce may have led to an increase in equality for women, it has also had an immense negative impact on children.<p>This isn't the result of divorce being more accessible, this is the result of how difficult it is to be a single parent and how little support you have on a single income while providing all primary care for your kids. The fix for that is to address systemic issues regarding class, gender discrimination, reduced access to family planning, health care access. Even by the chart you provided, single father households have not grown dramatically since the 1960s/1970s since women end up being primary care given for children in a majority of cases, whether by desire or by cultural default.<p>I agree with you 100% about awareness of cost, but easier access to divorce and a lessening of the cultural expectation that women be married has simply made existing problems more apparent to society at large, which is a good thing in terms of identifying where we need to fix social inequalities.",1355437657

I don't know if they would find it if I hid it away somewhere. Any suggestions on where else I can put it?<p>> But, a better approach might be to ask the user when they first visit this tab what grade they are in, save that, and then provide a button in the navigation bar to change that setting. (You can try using an action sheet for this.)<p>Good point - I'll probably implement this. One thing, though - for teachers that teach multiple grades, it might make it harder for them to find the different schedules at a glance. Then again, I'm not sure they really check the schedule in between each class.<p>> But, even more importantly, just like your grade, you probably don't change your schedule type very often! In fact, as you noticed since you put it at the top, unlike your grade (where everyone is probably evenly split between grade), most people all are on a normal schedule, and then everyone changes to weird ones once in a while. .... A better format for your schedule screen might be something along the lines of the weather app, where you flick to page between the different schedules.<p>Well, we have a PM activity schedule every Friday - but pagination might still be a better option.<p>> I might be wrong here, but I don't see the point of moving assignments around.<p>This allows for prioritizing - whenever you add an assignment in, it goes to the bottom of the list. However, if it is, for example, due before something that is above it, I like to move it up.<p>> I think the help text said I should be able to delete things, but I couldn't get that to work.<p>In regular mode (not manage mode), you can press and hold on an assignment to bring up the edit/delete menu. The modes are confusing - but I want to keep reordering and have it separate from the regular mode.<p>> Make it so I can check off an assignment by tapping anywhere in the entire table cell.<p>Good point - I'll do this.<p>> But, don't move anything around when you tap on them, just leave them there checked or unchecked.<p>Good idea - I think I'll remove the sectioned table view but move the completed assignments to the bottom (much like Clear).<p>> First, my guess is most of the time, people are going to get hall passes for one of the options in the ""List"" view.<p>Not really, actually - I usually use a hall pass to go see teachers, and I have to type their names in.<p>> I like the design of your custom ""List"" box, similar to your ""Jump"" view, but it's very different than the rest of the app and remember: if you're being clever like this, you probably need to simplify! iOS already has controls for this type of problem: the spinner.<p>I don't really like the look of spinners, but the list box might be a bit of an overkill. I'll look in to replacing it.<p>> Instead, they need things at 5-minute precison.<p>This is probably correct for times longer than, say, 10 minutes. However, for shorter times, 5-minute precision might be too limiting.<p>> I would move ""clear"" and ""submit"" to the left and right corners of the navigation bar.<p>I have them at the bottom to follow the natural flow of view - you fill out the form from top to bottom and hit submit.<p>> Also, its weird that you have two ways to ""clear"" a hall pass, though this might be a quirk with your school.<p>Now that I think about it - the clear button seems kind of useless. I'll get rid of that.<p>> Red isn't bad, but I'd dial down the saturation a bit since bright red is a danger color.<p>Red is our school's color. The saturation might be a bit high, though, so I'll change that. I just used the default red navigation bar that came with PrettyKit. Overall, though, I'll work on trying to come up with a single color scheme.<p>> I'm not sure where your buttons came from for Hall Pass but they are a little weird and are not standard iOS-styled buttons.<p>Yeah - they're BButtons (<a href=""https://github.com/mattlawer/BButton"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mattlawer/BButton</a>). I saw them on CocoaControls and thought they would be kind of cool. They may be overboard, though.<p>> I think it is a little too small as the ""Tap here"" text is up too far against the edges of the control.<p>I do think it is too small - I'll try to make it larger while still fitting in the toolbar.<p>> When users launch the app they will see the calendar tab as the app opens and the table view will ""pop in"".<p>I'll look in to doing this.<p>> Think about what your users will actually use.<p>Great point - I was hoping that the feedback feature would be useful for this.<p>> How did you get into this?<p>After 6th grade, I developed a simply prototype of an app to handle the hall passes. My technology-education teacher saw it and asked me whether I would be interested in developing a much broader app to replace the agendas. This kind of got me started - I asked my classmates for what they would like to see and started developing those features.<p>> Were your parents involved?<p>Not really - they gave me some feedback and encouragement, but not any help with developing the app.<p>> How could we get more kids like you to try hacking on their iPhones?<p>I think startups like makegameswith.us (and CodeCademy to some extent) are helping with this. Having a computer science class (or teaching programming in, say, tech-ed) as early as middle school would be great.<p>> Great work and keep it up!

You don't want to concede ground to your competition. Now if they want to fight for it that is a entirely different story.<p>Apple would never make iTunes for Android though, so it's an unfair comparison. I have every reason to believe that Google would be willing to have its Maps application be the default.<p>I don't think any actual users realized that Google did not write the code for the previous Maps application, it makes no difference who writes the code. It was Google Maps, that's all that mattered. Apple already has exclusive rights to approve all iOS applications, so having a third party write the code would not be any more of a risk than shipping an internal app everyone knows is powered by Google.",1355436302

Take Dribbbble - folks follow, share, meet, and eventually collaborate with total strangers, following basically the same script I did 10 years ago. One of the qualities of successful online communities is their ability to catalyze connections between individuals through external channels - not just comments on a photo thread, but sharing IM, SMS, meatspace. Older communities like bikeforums.net are living artifacts of the old model. Some newer communities, like Meetup, race you through the first couple stages. Facebook works very hard to keep you inside.<p>I think my personal investment in communities has simply become focused on more immediate circles.

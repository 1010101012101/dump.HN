My current job is cushy but very badly paid.<p>By cushy I mean they have flexi time and let me work 100% from home even though the office is less than 10 miles away. The boss is not pushy about deadlines and the work is not challenging.<p>By badly paid I mean I make about half of what I should be at my level of skill and experience.<p>I live in a small town. I could move to a big city and get more money, but I think my happiness level would drop. I really like it here. Life is good.<p>Of course, at least once a week I start getting paranoid and thinking that the company will eventually go under (we&#x27;ve had a few rough patches) and I&#x27;ll have to move. And then I&#x27;ll have spent 10+ years being underpaid with nothing to show for it, and it won&#x27;t look good to a potential new employer. I worry that I&#x27;ll be too old to be employable. That I should move now for my families sake. But then, I wonder how many successful well paid programmers look back over a career and think &quot;well, I&#x27;m glad I spent less time with my family, because now I have all that extra money&quot;<p>As for the work, as I said, it&#x27;s not challenging. I&#x27;ve been tinkering with computers since I was a child, and its been a natural career path for me. I really don&#x27;t think I could have been anything else, it was always going to be code. There are moments when I think I&#x27;m wasting my life standing in front of a monitor for 8 hours a day, but there are worse jobs, and I have to put food on the table. And that&#x27;s really a complaint about society in general, not an issue with my particular choices.<p>I code outside of work hours, making apps and web-services mostly for my own use. I&#x27;ve never been very good at making money off any of them, but that&#x27;s not really the point. I do it because it&#x27;s who I am. My worst nightmare (sad but true) is coming down with some kind of a medical condition that would prevent me from typing or looking at screens. It would kill me.",1454320776

There is nothing to fix here. You could say, &quot;if they are unhappy at the end, there <i>is</i> something to fix&quot;.<p>Most rational people don&#x27;t understand this because of the <i>logic</i>: you don&#x27;t want to produce a future unhappiness.<p>Let&#x27;s take a softer example: in a winter morning, how should you dress up?<p>Well, a rational mind would look at the weather forecast, open his window to feel the outside temperature and dress up accordingly.<p>But some other people won&#x27;t care. The &quot;effort&quot; required to make the right decision is too high, the gain is too low, why care after all?<p>For those people, there are three outcomes possible:<p>1. they took a good decision without the information and will be happier than the rational guys, because they did not have to care about taking the decision and the outcome was good<p>2. they took a bad decision but still it was not worth the effort and even if they got a little cold during a few hours, they&#x27;ll make it at the end<p>3. they took a bad decision which they must turned into bad enough consequences so that they should have cared (eg. they got cold)<p>And the best is that in category #3, a rational person would learn from what happened and avoid to reproduce it, but being irrational allows the person to not learn from its experience.<p>The conclusion to this is that since most of our decision making in everyday life is rational, it is hard to understand those who don&#x27;t act the same way. Also we all are more or less rational, because that&#x27;s what society forces us to be in respect of the others. But some topic, like how to spend money, or dress in the morning are left to one&#x27;s freedom, and must not be controlled by some higher rationality.<p>Nothing proves us that the irrational outcome won&#x27;t be better that the rational one. What if outcome #1 <i></i>is<i></i> the most realistic one?<p>We are too rational.",1454320756

If you get good enough result at final high school exam you can study at public university on a free course. If not (or if you prefer to study at evenings and weekends) - you have to pay. Roughly 30-50% of students study for free. The stereotype is that free education is better (because the paid courses set bad incentives to teachers to let pass everybody, and because they will admit anybody who pays).<p>The effect is - in general kids from well-off families do better at school and don&#x27;t have to work when they are 18 - so they study for free and get a degree that&#x27;s worth more in labour market.<p>Others pay for studies and often have to work during the day, and study at evenings/weekends, and in the end they get a degree that&#x27;s &quot;second class&quot;.<p>IMHO it&#x27;s still a better system than USA (I&#x27;m not familiar with UK system so can&#x27;t compare), because the competition for students means that universities can&#x27;t charge outrageous prices like in USA.

So I was eager to see what have changed in the mean time and whether that would change me my belief that C++ is the worst language I ever used .<p>After several tutorials, text books, learning the new features in C++ 11 etc, my mind has changed. C++ is a horrible language trying to get better. Beyond the usual crap and total disregard of good design that this language and its libraries exhibit , it does not fail to suprise me something like fstream.good() to detect that the file has not reach its end , its just blows the mind.<p>But C++ is a necessary evil in my case, so the torture continues.",1454318893

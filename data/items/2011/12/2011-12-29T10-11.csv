In fact, they stated several times that they were not the same, and made it quite clear that you would not be getting Stanford credit of any kind for the class. For the database class, I did receive a ""letter of achievement"" or somesuch from the professor, but it was a letter from the professor and not from Stanford. For the Machine Learning class, I didn't even get that.<p>In the database class they did say that this class wasn't terribly different from the real Stanford class, but that the Stanford students would probably be assigned a bit more of the problems that were particularly challenging. Those questions, however, were pretty much the least valuable questions in the entire class, since they had little relationship to any kind of query you'd ever use in the real world. I.e., they're the kind of question that teachers like to put in there so that you can have a more distinct grading curve. In any case, the database class was a fair amount of work, so I don't think that it is likely to make a Stanford education seem too easy.<p>The Machine Learning class, on the other hand, never made any claim at all of being remotely like the real Stanford class. Their only claim was that it would give you a good foundation to use Machine Learning techniques in the real world. That is a completely true statement. As it turns out, however, Stanford <i>did</i> offer the free Machine Learning class that I took as a real Stanford class for those at Stanford who wanted an easier version of Machine Learning.",1325155523

But I wonder what kind of game can truly be write-once, run-everywhere, and considered ""fun"" on all platforms.<p>A few major challenges:<p>- Designing a game that is fun and intuitive to play with a wide variety of input controllers (touch, mouse, keyboard, joystick).<p>- Handling the entire spectrum of screen resolutions, from older iPhones to high-end desktop computers. The game would also probably need to work in both portrait and landscape modes.<p>- The QA effort alone could be huge. Testing on quirky desktop browsers or buggy Android devices alone could be a dealbreaker.<p>- I'd argue that the time spent trying to figure out a game design or technical workaround for a particular platform would be better spent focusing on one platform and making the game more fun. In my experience, trying to make a fun game involves a lot of trial and error and iteration, and I personally don't think I could do it if I also had to keep in mind multiple distinct target platforms.<p>I can envision a couple one-button games like Angry Birds or Tiny Wings possibly having a chance, but even in those cases, I'd argue it'd be better to nail one platform first and then incrementally add other platforms instead of spreading oneself too thin.",1325154844

My impression is that most people don't know how, aren't able to, or generally won't retain digital information that long - so I don't mind spending money on paper, if it means that person (or their kids) will call me in 3-5-10-20 years instead of looking for someone else.<p>Paper and physical things also convey a lot of information - not just their literal content, but also cultural/social and economic information. When someone spends a tenth of a cent spamming me with some crappy E-mail, I notice. And if someone spends $5 or $10 to send me nicely designed marketing material on nice paper, I notice. I'm not saying that dictates my buying decision - but I know that I'm willing to spend money on marketing if it's to the right person who's likely to do business with me, and if I can tell someone spent real money to reach me or communicate with me, it demonstrates that they're seriously interested in interacting with me.<p>Nice materials also suggest permanence/longevity and success - I'm pretty wary of spending a lot of money with an organization that appears to consist of one guy with a laptop and a cellphone and a $20/month VPS - because I don't feel very confident that he'll be there if I need post-purchase support, or I want to buy another one of whatever he's selling.<p>If I talked to someone who said ""I don't have a business card but if you give me your e-mail address I'll get in touch"" I would suspect that the person wasn't very committed to their business/profession if they couldn't be bothered (or couldn't afford) to spend a little money on business cards. It <i>would</i> make an impression - but not necessarily a favorable one.",1325153270

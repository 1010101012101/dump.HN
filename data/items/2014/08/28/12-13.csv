Imho, many would probably be fine with other people listening in on their phone calls, or going over their browsing history, if the only effect of that would be terrorists getting caught.<p>The problem is that currently there is too much potential for the surveilance data to be comercialized or abused for trivial legal matters.<p>I think much of the debate could be settled by alowing the public to scrutinize the surveillance process, and putting any abuse of the data (i.e. its usage in non-terror-related situations) under extordinarily humiliating punishments (like denationalization).",1409230783

Path tracing is an embarrassingly parallel problem but only under the assumption that the entire scene description can be accessed.<p>When a light ray strikes the ceiling it can bounce off towards a vase that is on a diffuse table which scatters the light in all directions. So the calculation for this light ray needs to know the shape and material (BRDF) of all the objects that interact with the ray.<p>Before sending out the ray from the camera into the scene it is unknown what objects are going to be hit along the way - as you can imagine is a difficult problem to optimize for. The usual solution is to just distribute the entire scene.<p>On a single computer there is no problem, the entire scene is usually present in memory. On multiple computer it is more difficult since you will end up distributing large amounts of data (scenes can be multiple gigabytes).",1409230607

Whatever respect you&#x27;ve thought you&#x27;ve earned doesn&#x27;t see to be there, does it?<p>Another issue: you now have competition as a technical director, and if you are, as it sounds, great at tech and not so great at politics (you were, after all, blindsided by this), you may not like what&#x27;s going to be happening at your company.  E.g. one story of Netscape&#x27;s decline and fall on the browser side is their acquiring an unsuccessful company and the people from that company somehow managing to wrest control of the development of the next generation browser, and abjectly failing.<p>I.e.

Have you planned out a solid structure that will enable teams to grow? Have you strong knowledge of technical architecture and infrastructure as well as software development? I could go on. Is this all part of your role as technical director?<p>Maybe you have all of these things, but the main thing you called out was that you have &quot;built software that only a few people could have done&quot;. Being CTO of a 450 person company involves a lot more than just building software. Again I could be misreading your situation, please clarify if I am.<p>It sucks that your boss said he would never hire a manager for tech, but by the sounds of it the company dynamic is volatile with acquisitions. As for whether you should quit, no one here can tell you whether you should or not. Why not raise your grievance with your boss and make the case for getting what you want, and then make your decision from there. Just be sure you actually know what it is that you want - if you want to keep primarily building software a CTO role may not be for you.",1409230465

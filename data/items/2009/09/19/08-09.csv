831791,comment,829268,831707,0,0,Confusion,,,"Although I can't see the original comment anymore, I can imagine it: I was probably thinking along the same lines. Let me try to explain thoughts of the 'hand-waving and pseudo-philosophical' kind:<p>The main problem with Hickey's presentation is that it is unclear how well he actually understands the philosophy he cites and especially how thoroughly he investigated the alternatives to that philosophy. He presents a single view and doesn't debate it, while it warrants a book of its own.<p>Something you can see clearly in students of philosophy, psychology and those 'softer' subjects, where multiple truths seem to exist, is that they tend to change opinions and general outlook along with what they learned last. The last thing they read made an impression and it is the first thing on their mind.  This lasts until they reach the point of enlightenment, where they notice this fact and start to integrate their knowledge. But not everybody reaches that point, by having studied enough philosophy.<p>Now you can be a world class physicist or computer scientist: that doesn't make you a good philosopher. In fact, great scientists have been known to espouse some pretty strange philosophies, whose implications they obviously didn't fully grasp. In light of that, Hickey's talk brings to mind the crackpots waving Kuhn's 'paradigm shift' around, without actually understanding it.<p>It is also unclear how relevant the philosophical grounding is for the actual contents of his talk. If he left all the Whitehead quotes out, wouldn't it be a better presentation? If so, then he's guilty of basically an argument-by-authority: trying to prove his notions about time in programming are good, because he can call upon someone of the stature of Whitehead. I'm not convinced that isn't the case here, although I'm sure it was not the intent.<p>I think all this 'philo-babble' detracts from the actual point he is trying to make. You're bound to get into endless debates about Whiteheads notion of time and such, while losing sight of the fact that Hickey makes a few practical points that most people probably agree on. A thorough analysis of time in object oriented programming does not need to be a full fledged philosophy and it definitely seems like hubris to present it as such. Hickey should stick to what he knows best and perhaps give some pointers as to philosophies supporting him, instead of making that his main point.",1253348820

I deleted it, not because I disagreed with what I wrote, and certainly not because I wanted to ""game the karma system"" (could anything be more asinine?), but because when I took a step back and looked it over, it wasn't a tone I really cared to strike and it didn't seem likely to lead to a good discussion.<p>I often use HN in this way. Something bothers or puzzles me, I don't know what it is, so I write about it until it's out of my system. On rare occasions, I then delete it.<p>Google indexed it, so perhaps my ""flawed viewpoint"" can be brought back from cache someday for that ""brutal down modding"".<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=gruseom+hickey+pretentious+pseudo-philosophical+deconstruction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=gruseom+hickey+pret...</a><p>Obviously I wouldn't have deleted my comment if I had seen yours.",1253348621

831783,comment,831180,831180,0,0,derefr,,,"But to get back to the conversation that prompted this thought, the same thing could be done with a .dmg; instead of requesting to move itself when a program finds itself unzipped in ~/Downloads, a program could prompt to copy itself to the Applications folder and relaunch from there if it finds itself running from within its disk image. To imagine the dialog, the buttons would be ""Copy"" (default), ""Copy, then Eject and Trash this Image"" (for convenience), and ""Run from Here"" (or perhaps not—there's no really good reason to include it.) You don't have to include the decision between ""Copy and Run"" or ""Just Copy"" because the program is already ""running"" (from the user's perspective); they double-clicked it, didn't they?<p>But because they see the program as ""running"" from inside the image, they might try to launch the program <i>again</i> from within the .dmg after it had already been copied (if they didn't choose the Trash Image option.) Thus, the program should probably check for a copy of itself in /Applications and exec(3) it if it exists <i>and is the same version</i>, to avoid the lag of re-installing on every start. Though, since you want to kindly escort the users away from the .dmg, it might be better to present another dialog with the options ""Run from /Applications"" and ""Copy Again"" (to overwrite the old app—in case of a bad install or somesuch), giving them a small speedbump and a hint about where to find their app. The we-already-did-this dialog could even offer to automatically add an alias of the app to the Desktop or the Dock, ""so you won't have to see this again.""",1253348373
831782,comment,831643,831643,0,0,jacquesm,,,"This brought up some traumatic memories from very long ago.<p>To make a long story short, such a key would have come in fairly handy at some point in my life (only we didn't have 3D printers then).<p>The longer story:<p>In Amsterdam, in the early 70's they were building a subway. This led to all kinds of bad feeling between the people and the municipal government culminating in riots on the 'Nieuwmarkt' where a bunch of houses would have to be torn down.<p>My dad was there when it happened and spotted a police issue pair of handcuffs on the ground after the melee.<p>He picked them up and took them home as a 'souvenir'. A little while later he had to go on a trip and an uncle came to look after us.<p>I found the handcuffs and tried them on my one hand first 'crrrrclick', ok, that was fun. Then - of course - the other arm. I showed my uncle who thought it was funny but told me to take them off.<p>Slight problem, they were on pretty solid, I'd pushed the ratchets as far as they would go. Now panic set in, causing my wrists to swell. My uncle freaked out too, searched everywhere for a key (which wasn't there) and finally had to call the police to get me 'liberated'.<p>They were definitely not pleased and after releasing me took their handcuffs with them and issued a fairly stern warning and had my dad report to the station for another lecture upon his return.",1253348292

Aren't there a million web designers out there they can interview instead, or am I just missing something?<p>I know they had a ""Part 1"" (which my computer is utterly failing to access right now or I'd verify the following), but from what I remember, it was about how they use Clojure, and there's an entire scalability angle to get that I'd rather hear.",1253347863

So if typically you find that you can push 300 Mbit out of a box you can expect to get around that much inbound or a bit less, depending on your application.",1253347467

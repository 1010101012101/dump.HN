593995,comment,593323,593475,0,0,caerwyn,,,"Here's the relevant quote from the acme paper by Rob Pike, ""Cedar was, however, the major inspiration for Oberon [Wirt89], a system of similar scope but much smaller scale. Through careful selection of Cedar’s ideas, Oberon shows that its lessons can be applied to a small, coherent system that can run efficiently on modest hardware. In fact, Oberon probably errs too far towards simplicity: a single-process system with weak networking, it seems an architectural throwback.<p>""Acme is a new program, a combined window system, editor, and shell, that applies some of the ideas distilled by Oberon. Where Oberon uses objects and modules within a programming language (also called Oberon), Acme uses files and commands within an existing operating system (Plan 9). Unlike Oberon, Acme does not yet have support for graphical output, just text. At least for now, the work on Acme has concentrated on producing the smoothest user interface possible for a programmer at work. """,1241528256

593980,comment,593020,593569,0,0,stcredzero,,,"The C DLL was one of RSA Data Securities reference implementations from about a decade back.  The Smalltalk guy could ask the VM implementor for goodies -- like 32 bit and 64 bit bit-arrays and various primitive operations on them.<p>So long as you keep an entire algorithm in one method, and restrict yourself to certain optimized operations, the resulting JIT-ed code will look like it was produced by an unoptimized C compiler.  There will be no Smalltalk message sends.  (This approach is a bit fragile, though, since you have to have esoteric knowledge to maintain code like that and keep the same level of optimization.  Most of the time, you'd just implement a speed-critical operation like this as a DLL in C to be called from Smalltalk.  Smalltalk/X has a different approach -- you just inline C code in your Smalltalk method.)<p>Combine that with naive memory management in the C code, and you have C code that loses a benchmark.  Mind you, that was bad C code -- reference code only has to be correct, not fast.<p>""Smalltalk is Slow"" usually a sign of ignorance or trolling.  For lots of problem domains, the advanced commercial Smalltalk VMs are pretty darn fast.",1241527004

Potentially you'd be able to follow the map all the way to libc at the north pole ...<p>Why? Because it'd be a great way to visualize the way projects fit together. It may even help us better identify projects that bridge the same gaps, which may be an opportunity for collaboration between the teams. Or it may shed light on an especially sparse area, where more projects need to exist. If anything, it could be a great way to become more acquainted with things we indirectly use on a daily basis.<p>What do you think?",1241526595

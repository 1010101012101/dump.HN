205635,comment,205572,205628,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Precisely. For all the hackers ignoring it, there stands the simple fact: people reuse passwords over and over again, for bank accounts, email, and everything else. I don't know what the stats are, but I'd bet if you randomly query people in, say, your or family, you'll find quite a few. At least I did.<p>So while capturing a password over HTTP and replaying it gives access to someone's karma in a site like this, once you actually know the plaintext password you could, for many people, use it to break into otherwise secure sites (even using SSL), like gmail. This has serious reprecussions.<p>Finding a password over the wire is just like finding password: <something> in a closed drawer. Sure, you don't know what it's for, but were you malicious, you'd be able to try a host of different places.",1212292553

205632,comment,205572,205572,0,0,curiousgeorge,,,"huh? whatever you do on the client machine you're still open to a man in the middle attack . hashing passwords simply make it more difficult for eavesdroppers to figure out the original password, and keep people from passing potentially sensitive information across the net in cleartext.<p>use SSL for things you need to keep secure, like credit card payments. If you can't set that up, outsource stuff to a payment provider like Paypal until you get your house in order. Otherwise be more clear about your security concerns in your write-up, so people know WHAT you are trying to solve instead of HOW you are trying to solve... something.",1212292393

I'm personally not working a full time coding job yet because I'm still in school and I still have quite a bit that I want to learn just hacking around on my own smaller projects.<p>The fact that the concept of a salt isn't totally automatic to him or that he misspelled nonce only means that he shouldn't be designing security systems right now. There is a lot that we can all learn, some of us just have farther to go than others.",1212292332

Attackers who can observe raw traffic can hijack it (if it's the '90s) or redirect it (if it's 5 years ago, and in Brazil, and money is involved --- just to make it specific).<p>Look, we're locked in an Internet message board death struggle and neither of us are going to concede anything, so let me just finish with this tangent:<p>If you tried to sell an app to a Fortune 1000 company that defended against passive-only attackers but left logins open to active attackers, and they contracted out a 1 week 1 person web pen test to make sure your app was safe for peripheral customer data to go inside, you'd get dinged for this and you'd cut a dot release.<p>If, instead of cutting a dot release you explained why it was worth them moving ahead with a pilot that defended against passive attackers, you would Lose The Sale. Seen it happen.<p>I don't much care about your Hacker News password, but lots of you write applications, and I've seen some of the most unlikely (message boards, bug trackers, blogs---err, content managers) wind up in security audit hell.

In fact, I explicitly stated that I was <i>not</i> saying that the suggested mechanism was a good idea.<p>But even if only 0.0001% of attackers are limited to passive-only attacks (and I suspect the actual value is higher -- more like 0.1%) then the suggested mechanism is 0.0001% more secure than transmitting the password in plaintext -- which invalidates your assertion that it ""provides no additional security"".",1212291068

205608,comment,205318,205601,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Huh?  Have you seen a Linux system in the past, oh, I dunno, 12 years?  Package management on Linux is the absolute best available.  apt-get/dpkg and yum/RPM pretty much rule, and you'd be nuts to choose Mac OS X package management (or the absolute lack thereof) over either of them.<p>There may be many wonderful things about Mac OS X, but package management is not among them.  And, interestingly, it <i>is</i> one of the wonderful things about Linux (excepting the mildly retarded distributions...which shall remain nameless, but they rhyme with ""Gentoo"" and ""Slackware"").<p>The interesting thing about package management is that until you've actually spent some time with a better solution, you'll think great things about a significantly inferior solution (Mac OS X, for example, where a ""package"" is effectively just a big ball of crap that spews out across your system on install, and can't be verified, uninstalled or upgraded cleanly, and can't really deal with dependencies).  After spending 10 years with systems that <i>know</i> where everything is on the system, and what the dependency chain looks like for every installed application, and can upgrade/downgrade/uninstall anything using a single command, I sit down to a Windows or Mac OS X system with what can only be described as dread.<p>It's the one thing that would absolutely be a deal-breaker for me, with regard to using Mac OS X heavily (particularly for development).  The big ball of crap packaging is just too painful.",1212290156

4090550,comment,4090298,4090298,16,0,latch,,,"Part of the answer is Java itself. It's verbose, static typed, and requires a lot of boilerplate code to do properly. The fact that classes are a compile-time concern, rather than a runtime concern, is just such a drag. You end up with interfaces you don't really need, only so that you can inject them into constructors so that your app is properly decoupled and testable.<p>Part of it is a framework issue. Struts is horrible...absolutely, stunningly horrible. Your controller is an XML file (seriously). Freemarker (the main templating language) makes ColdFusion look awesome.<p>Play is better, but it seems built for the way websites were created in mid-2000. JSON is still a second-class citizen. Static actions are a weird choice given IoC is achieved via DI in a static language.<p>Edit: I should add that there's also the persistence story. Anyone who's done [n]Hibernate knows that it's, at best, a mixed blessing. Even Java's NoSQL drivers are verbose compared to their dynamic brothers (first-class hash support is a big issue here, for some drivers in particular). I'm not sure something like Sequel would even be possible to write, and the AR implementations are, again, limited by the compiled-time nature of the language and the inability of bend the syntax into a nice DSL.<p>Java also lacks lambdas, and generic support is weak. And what's up with int vs Integer...the list goes on and on.",1339317685

On my brother, there is a small hole on the cartridge that light is passed through to detect the toner level.<p>My printer is at 3200 pages on the starter toner because I put a piece of tape over the sensor which makes it believe it is always full of toner.<p>New printers from Brother which I bought the same model for my in-laws, have solved this hack.  But you can buy a replacement gear online for a few bucks, it pops on, and then you have access to the same method I used to trick the printer.<p>Once the stater runs out, I will get a toner replacement and also tape the sensor.  Even if it prints a little light, all it takes it taking the cartridge out and shaking it a little.  This will buy you another month.<p>If you are on Mac OS X or Linux and access the printer through CUPS, ( not sure about Windows and how to access these settings ) and you can set the DPI to a lower rate and put it in toner saver mode.

4090534,comment,4087259,4089361,2,0,Legion,,,"I agree with you, and my Vim setup is loaded with plugins.<p>The power of Vim is, first and foremost, Vim. A good set of plugins is simply for augmenting Vim and/or tailoring it to your desired workflow.<p>The plugins I use could be broken up into groups. The first group are the ones that add truly valuable core functionality to Vim. This is the smallest group of plugins by far. I consider the ""fuzzy finder"" plugins to be in this group (Command-T is the one I use). These plugins add meaningful, widely-applicable functionality to the editor.<p>Then, there are the ones that are convenience plugins. An example is ack-vim. It lets me run ack from within Vim, and provides the ability to jump directly to files in the result list. I am, of course, perfectly capable of running ack in my terminal. But this makes using ack slightly more convenient.<p>Next are purely aesthetic ones, like colorschemes. Not important, but pleasant.<p>Finally, there are the updated language configurations - the things that provide language-specific syntax highlighting, indention, and so on. Vim already comes bundled with these. Adding them as plugins simply allows you to pull the very latest versions of them. Nice to keep these up-to-date, but unless your Vim build is old, you'll already have pretty recent versions of these.<p>I would miss these plugins if I could never use them again, but when I use a different editor, I rarely find myself missing <i>plugins</i>, but I find myself missing core Vim very badly.",1339316862

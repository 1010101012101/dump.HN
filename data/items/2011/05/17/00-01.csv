I would say, ""If you need to hide something from me, that's cool, but I'm going to know that you hid something and I'm going to ask about it, so keep that in mind.""  The purpose of the monitoring software would be to provide an opportunity to analyze the potential consequences of my kids' online activities.<p>Of course, imagining and doing are very different things, so ask me again in <i>n</i> years after I've actually started a family and see if I actually followed my own advice ;).",1305593995

If you file a worthless patent then no-one will be interested in your innovation and there will be no-one to sue.  If however you file something valuable you would expect to potentially have lots of people to sue.  In your example the question arises, why have so many people trespassed on this patent?  We know they have an incentive - it is valuable.  But why in this hypothetical case did they trespass?  Did they think the patent was breakable?  the patent holder weak?  the market opportunity so great that they would build now pay later?  Perhaps they didn't find the patent?  So many questions.

Oh, and we're not going to tell you about the patent we've got a licence for which means you're going to owe somebody else another 0.575% as well. Good luck making a living on that.""<p>Thanks Apple... You're making the decision about whether to invest my time in iOS app development for my clients a lot easier...

Equity should only be given to people who are making a long term commitment to the project, and use cliffs, etc.<p>Typically IP only covers code, design, etc. it doesn't cover ideas, so an idea for a pivot wouldn't be protected by IP law regardless of who came up with it or where. If you decide to build a startup based on your pivot idea just don't use any code, designs, etc. from the weekend unless you've got some kind of agreement in place for it.",1305590515

At least that's how baseXX has been used to far (I searched the web before doing this), and I am in favor of sticking to that naming convention. Agreed?<p>Now, whether we could come up with such streaming algorithm I'm not sure. I tried solving this problem, and this is what I came up with. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough to go the other route... I guess you could simply slice the incoming stream into a set of chunks, each small enough to make bigin base62 conversion fast (which is square of the size of the chunk), and yet large enough to obscure the occasional loss of space at the chunk boundaries... I guess that would be an option...",1305590498

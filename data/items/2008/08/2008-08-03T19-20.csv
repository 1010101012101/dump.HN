I'd be surprised if any sane person held it against him, but I know that there was a Canadian psychologist who was turned away at the US border because he wrote an essay about using LSD for research purposes, <i>four decades ago</i>, when it was legal.",1217793150
265689,comment,265567,265653,0,0,gruseom,,,"On the contrary, I have zero interest in the oppositions you set up. I said nothing about ""lifestyle"" vs. ""VC-funded"" businesses, and neither did the OP (other than gratuitously name-dropping 37 Signals at one point).  Approximately, you're telling me that I'm involved in a war between pandas and oranges because I commented on a post about dinner plates.<p>I spoke so harshly of this post, not because I have any opinion about whether startups ought to seek venture capital, but because it says things like this: YC <i>""hire as many gullible young naive programmers as possible and work them to death""</i>, and <i>""Who will end up really getting the spoils out of any of YCombinatorâ€™s work?  Paul Graham.""</i> These statements are demonstrably false. Worse, they are falsehoods which anybody could easily learn are false with just a little research.<p>Then there's this whole other level of nastiness. Paul Graham thinks that <i>""designing and building is for chumps""</i>. He wants to <i>""make the big bucks and sit on [his] ass""</i>. He (by implication) <i>""can't wait to screw over the next guy""</i>. Are you telling me that I am wrong to call this ""personally ugly""?<p>Clearly, you and I have very different tastes in writing style. More importantly, I object to your reasoning that if I criticize someone who is doing X (combating and casting enemies), I must also be doing X.",1217793049

265685,comment,265560,265661,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>I think the same is true with criminal records. If everyone sees how prevalent marijuana use is, eventually society will stop demonizing it. In the case of other crimes, perhaps you can explain yourself out of the shame.</i><p>This sort of assertion I tend to doubt. Many of the people who seek to demonize and preserve the criminal status of marijuana have, in fact, used it, although they defend their behavior with pithy excuses like ""I was young and dumb"" or ""it was the '60s; it was different back then"". Society doesn't demonize the rare vices, unless they are dangerous to innocent people, e.g. pedophilia, so much as it lunges for the common ones. What do the morals police stand to gain from crusading against, say, a blue-and-yellow-striped-dress fetish? Virtually no one has such a fetish, so it gives them no power base. Premarital sex, on the other hand...<p>You might hope that people with rigid moral stances might soften them when they discover good people who live differently, but the fact is that a lot of these people are more inclined to turn against old friends than to revise their opinions.<p>The issue with vice voyeurism is, moreover, not one of acceptance so much as privacy and professionalism. Pretty much everyone accepts that sex is a part of normal life, but no one would want to have his/her sexual history available on the Internet, nor come up at a place of work.",1217792650

265682,comment,265508,265508,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"It's a reasonable question. In fact most of the internet industry is based on advertising, even Google, Yahoo and MSN.<p>It seems like there are 2 models. 
1) Provide advertising users really want resulting in clicks 
2) Provide a service to important to consumers/businesses they can't live without it and are willing to pay for it<p>Right now mostly everyone is working on 1) by trying to be the company who can sell another business a ""guaranteed"" customer.<p>A few companies (like 37signals) are working on 2) but that's much harder for a number of reasons. Until the internet is more embedded in our lives it's harder to provide a concrete value. Because the internet is so friction-less it's very easy for someone to compete with you reducing your share of a small market. Finally even now it's mostly middle class to upper class people with good internet access, dramatically reducing the market size (Exxon obviously sell to everyone).",1217792211

Google should really anonymize most usenet postings done > 10 years ago.",1217791524

But I completely agree.<p>There are two strains of culture in Cambridge, ""you should be smarter"" which is why I love living here. And ""you should have two PHDs"" -- which is very different and unfortunate message. It's almost the opposite of the Valley, which speaks so reverently of the Harvard drop-out.<p>The best thing that those of us who live in Cambridge could do is keep the culture focused on ideas and less on diplomas.",1217791237

 * centrifugal force to extract water<p>It looks like by adding the plastic chips the surface area and frequency at which the laundry is beaten is increased. This allows for the reduction in water.<p>Depending what kind of ""plastic"" is used it may be something biodegradable.<p>The stains and smell associated with dirty laundry is because of the foreign contaminants in the cloth. If those are removed and absorbed by the plastic particle then the clothes won't smell any more.<p>Personally I wonder how many plastic particle would 'escape' each wash though. That could be a bit of a pain. But this seems like a great improvement to washing machine technology.",1217791178

Hobbes as a motile, living, thinking being exists entirely as a figment in Calvin's mind, projected into the object of the toy tiger.

Loopt is obviously one.  There's another that's almost as old but is building something so big that they haven't launched yet.

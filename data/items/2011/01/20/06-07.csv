2122937,comment,2121428,2121692,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"It is something of a problem in the teaching of the early stages of math, as opposed to arithmetic.  Most people like to have motivating examples, most people like to see that what they are doing is relevant, and that it makes sense.  Trying to tell people that F=>X is true, regardless of X, offends most people's sense of what's reasonable.<p>Consider.  Suppose that in a tennis match each point is won or lost independently of all other points, and suppose further that the server has a 95% chance of winning each point.  It seems reasonable to assume that the probability of winning the game from a winning position is always greater than the probability of winning the game from the beginning.<p>But this is not true!  The probability of winning the game from 40:30 up is less than the probability of winning from Love All (99.986% vs 99.991%).<p>Some students, even those who are quite competent at probability and can follow the calculations, find that this offends their sensibilities and decide that it's all rubbish.<p>People get very upset if you contradict their common sense.  To claim that the sentence:<p><pre><code>  If n is an integer and both even and odd, then n=17.\n</code></pre>\nis true gets some people really confused.  The hurdle of understanding why it's true needs to be passed, otherwise most of math will remain unattainable.<p>(edited to add the actual probabilities)",1295506691

I bet any decent entrepreneur could find $300 million savings per year in the California state budget.<p>In Australia there was a big push by a coalition of major retailers to force international internet sales to be taxed at the National Goods and Services Tax, which is 10% - or to exempt them from sales taxes for items under $1000.   This backfired as everyone laughed at them, pointing out most people purchased on the internet for savings of 50% or more, and then asked how they were going to track every shipment into the country and collect tax on it.  As a double insult, the major retailers actually paid for a campaign to advertise that people can make big savings shopping at their online competitors.  You couldn't make this stuff up.<p>The only law that I think should change in California with relation to sales tax is that it should be illegal to advertise a price without sales tax included - in other words, all advertised prices should be inclusive of sales tax.

2122899,comment,2116532,2116904,0,0,bugsy,,,"The last time I looked into the empirical evidence on this in primary school, the finding was that class size makes a big difference if there are 13 or fewer students in a class because the teacher can use a style where he spends individual time with each student. But from 15 to 40 it flat lines because the teacher has to switch to lecture mode. So, unless you can reduce class size to 13, there's no benefit to doing it. And there really aren't any schools that are taking it that far. So they might as well ramp up to 40 students (above this discipline and control becomes a problem in K-12) and use the salary savings to buy textbooks or other materials, things that many school districts are now opting out of because their administrative, salary and other such costs are now so high.<p>Many countries that do better achievement wise than the US (assuming measured achievement results are valuable, which is debatable) have large classroom sizes in primary education. Japan's average is 40 students:<p>> The 1999 Pennsylvania State University study done by Suetling Pong concluded that the effect of class size on achievement is very small. It compared ten industrialized nations other than the U.S. and found that students in Australia, Flemish Belgium and France did significantly better in larger math classes. Class size had no effect on students in Canada, Germany, Iceland, South Korea and Singapore. And students in Japan, who consistently outscore U.S. students in math and science, frequently attend math classes of 40 or more students. source: <a href=""http://www.edreform.com/Archive/?Debunking_the_Class_Size_Myth_How_to_Really_Improve_Teacher_Effectiveness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edreform.com/Archive/?Debunking_the_Class_Size_My...</a>",1295504945

No text was added to the question page notifying competitors it had changed.  No confirmation of the change was officially made, afterwards.\n(You can verify this independent of my comment by reading the competition walls, or googling - the question was called 'power overwhelming').<p>Another issue - while they were technically correct - was where they said input to the first question would be <i>whitespace</i> separated, and give training examples showing it <i>space</i> separated, but then the test problems were <i>Newline</i> separated.  While its debatable whether Newline is whitespace (I'd say it is, but it typically doesn't match \s) this change from the training examples to the test confused a lot of people - and its bad programming competition form, to trip people up in the input specification.<p>Finally, due to the slew of problems in the round, they closed the round early, without warning. This upset competitors who came to submit their solutions, to find that the round had already closed.<p>AFAIK, they still have not clarified whether competitors from that round that answered questions will progress, or will all have to redo it.<p>Communication - including on topics such as rules - has been sporadic, and either via e-mail, or through posts left on the wall - sometimes in comments on the competition wall, rather than in organised FAQs, or using the facebook notification system.<p>Answer upload has also been temperamental for certain browsers.<p>But posing a programming competition question to 1000s of competitors, where the actual question is mis-specified - that's a very big error.<p>Rescheduling the succeeding sub-rounds at the last minute also inconvenienced a lot of programmers who had taken time out of their schedules to do it.<p>Its a programming competition, and its just for fun - but I'd like to think they'd do a better job considering the volume of contestants, and the wide external audience.",1295503650

Who wants to spend all that time reading the instructions for a test I might not even bother to take?  I clicked the link to download an input file, and then realized that doing so caused me to fail that question.  Not a good experience.  After encountering  something else that was the slightest bit confusing, I just gave up on the whole thing.",1295503590

If you work in SF you can live in Marin. It is often faster to go from Marin to SOMA than it is to go from the Sunset or Richmond to SOMA. I can't say it's a quick commute from the SC mountains to anywhere, but the option is there. I know Apple has a shuttle bus from Santa Cruz to Cupertino, maybe other firms do, too.<p>NYC metro is not great for stargazing but I was surprised that there are nice places for hiking upstate, and in NJ and CT. Even Vermont and the Berkshires are accessible for weekend trips.",1295503542

Unfortunately, Mac OS X has no equivalent to Direct2D (that's enabled for production, that is). You can enable hardware accelerated layers on Linux via about:config; they work, but they're disabled by default due to frequent driver crashes. You do get something approximating Direct2D on Linux Firefox via XRender, if your graphics drivers support it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2010/05/fast.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2010/05/fast.ht...</a>",1295503407

The main problem of the von Neumann machine is gathering and <i>transforming</i> enough materials on its own. If we need enormous amounts of ore and factories to do that, so does the machine. It would need to be mindboggingly <i>huge</i>, also because it needs enough fuel to reach new sources. A tiny machine won't work, because it can't refine it's own materials. Really, the practical problems are being hugely underestimated.",1295503335

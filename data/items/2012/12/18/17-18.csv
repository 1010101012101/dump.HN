Then there's the problem of actually tracking the rhino 24x7, through night and bad weather, while ensuring that the base station and recovery team stays close.<p>You'd also need skilled pilots / operators to keep the UAV on station and interpret what's on the screen and, once again, you'd need more than one per rhino to enable 24x7 shifts.<p>Once you factor in the number of UAVs, the dispersed recovery and handling teams and the need for skilled operators, you could potentially be speaking of 75 000 UAVs and a similar number of teams and pilots / operators. Even if we assume that UAVs with sufficient endurance for this task could be reduced to $500 000 each, that still results in a capital cost of nearly $40 billion, over and above the sure-to-be-mammoth operating costs. So it's not feasible.<p>A better approach is to fit each rhino with a GPS tracker, which is being done, and to use ranger patrols augmented by technology like UAVs and ground radar to attempt to spot poachers moving in the parks.

Python forces me to sprinkle the code with a thousand tests for whether or not the field is initialized yet, or write extra code to define things like defaultdict instances (with syntax that I always have to look up, and which in my experience most python programmers don't understand).<p>Not to mention that if I want to use an OO syntax for that data structure I have to write extra code defining a class for it (and inevitably be yelled at by the pythonista security branch for all the __whatnot__ methods I forgot to define).<p>Python's comprehension/generator syntax is nice, though, and doesn't have a clean analog in perl.  One thing it does do well is chaining up ""filter"" operations on aggregate data structures in a clean way.  And that has value and is worth emulating.  But honestly most of the rest of the language is junk compared to perl or ruby.",1355851051

My guess is that people don't know how much worse fried chicken sandwiches are for you compared to grilled chicken. A big part of fast food is deep fried french fries, which are mostly sold in ""large"" sizes due to value meals. There is also the soda element. I don't think most people realize how many calories are in the soda they get at fast food places, again, most likely in a ""large"" size.<p>2) A cheeseburger from McDonald's isn't that bad. But sandwiches like burgers have lots of ways to start pilling up the calories. Add an extra slice of cheese, toss on some mayonaise, maybe a little bacon. Pretty soon, you're hitting or going past the 1k calorie level.<p>So yes, a cheeseburger from McDonald's isn't that a bad (300 calories). A Angus Bacon Burger with large fries and a coke is a pretty bad meal (1600 calories).",1355851020

This will most likely be minutes.""<p>Everyone seems to hate on the DRM, thinking that it's just a business decision that is not at all integral to gameplay, but they all seem to be forgetting one key thing:<p>The new SimCity is, at its core, a multiplayer game!<p>Sure, it's a multiplayer game with the majority of the user experience dedicated to non-social, intra-city interactions. But your city lives within a global economy, and if it's possible to mutate your offline state without mutating your online state, then sync becomes a huge problem.<p>Consider the server that models a consistent virtual entrepreneur who's moving or visiting from one city to another (which the new AI actually might do, from seeing the videos). Now, say the destination city goes offline for hours. Both the source city and the destination city could end up <i>believing</i> that the virtual entrepreneur is helping their city grow. If the offline time period is short (i.e. the ""minutes"" that the developer refers to), then the offline city can ""snap back"" to the correct state much as laggy players see themselves jumping across a map in a shooter. But if it's a long offline period, they could be snapping back in a very visible and jarring way. And it's near impossible to test all of the edge cases unless you can make assumptions about maximum latency before a disconnect.<p>The developers can only be faulted for not <i>communicating</i> the intricacies of an MMO to their audience well enough. Instead, they allowed their game server to be characterized as a DRM device, and tried to respond to criticisms as if it was just a DRM device.<p>I want to be able to play Skyrim offline. But I have no qualms about WoW disconnecting me if I go offline for more than a few minutes, or if I tried to log on with a stolen or copied account. I'd expect them to do the same to other players who did so. On that note, we should really just be glad that they're not making SimCity a subscription service!",1355850725

4938359,comment,4935679,4937673,1,0,Zak,,,"<i>Well ok but what is the purpose of the gun amendment?</i><p>To reduce the likelihood of a totalitarian state. It was written by people who had recently participated in a violent secession from the world's largest empire. Self defense against ordinary criminals was another factor, and the Supreme Court has ruled that individuals have the right to own weapons for that purpose.<p><i>I can see the purpose of the ""Free Speech"" it makes sense today more than ever.</i><p>Limitations on the right to free speech are active political issues today. There has recently been a major push to limit ""blasphemous"" speech in western Europe and the US, for example. Source code as speech when the code does something governments want to regulate, like cryptography or DRM circumvention is not an entirely settled question, to provide another example.<p><i>What if unpopular rights are those that kill children</i><p>I count at least six out of ten amendments in the Bill of Rights as likely to have led directly to children dying. Free speech has led to violent action. Availability of weapons makes violent people more deadly. Four more amendments protect the rights of those accused of crimes, some of whom are required to be released when they would otherwise have been jailed. Some of those have killed children after their release.<p>Rights that are just a little unpopular don't need so much protection. The important rights all have the potential to get people killed, as does the lack of them.<p><i>Ok but doesn't that imply that the founding fathers somehow foresaw the advent of nuclear arms, school shootings, the internet and created a concise set of laws that would prevent us from sneaking in laws by creating loopholes.</i><p>Of course not. That's why we have courts.<p>The courts try to apply the original intent of the Constitution to modern situations. The authors of the Fourth Amendment probably couldn't have imagined laser microphones, but the courts have held that using one (or anything else high-tech) to eavesdrop on conversations you have in a private place is just like a search and requires a warrant. In other cases, the courts have limited the application of rights to new, unforeseeable technologies. The Supreme Court ruled, for example, in DC v. Heller that the Second Amendment doesn't apply to unusual and dangerous weapons; it protects the right to own handguns, but not nuclear warheads.<p>It is, of course perfectly reasonable to have a discussion about whether a right protected by the Constitution has a place in a modern society or if it should be eliminated or changed. My original point in this discussion is that we should not want it to be trivial to bypass Constitutional rights, e.g. by banning ammunition instead of guns because it would then become trivial to bypass any of them, at any time, for any reason.",1355850169

4938356,comment,4934131,4934815,1,0,pc86,,,"A stolen weapon used to commit a crime does not constitute a crime on the part of the original owner. In my state there is no legally required way to store a firearm. Shooting someone accidentally certainly leaves the person operating the firearm open to civil litigation, and possibly criminal prosecution. I don't think anyone has every implied otherwise. All the regulations that have been mentioned refer to <i>purchasing</i> a firearm. If you want to require rifles be locked up at night, make the argument that it will help prevent theft. Don't make the argument that someone can't purchase it in the first place.<p>I'm not a ""2nd Amendment absolutist"" as you put it, no more than I am a free speech or free press absolutist. I have no problem with licensure or registration so long as it's not prohibitive, and you will be hard pressed to find gun owners who say there are no responsibilities associated with gun ownership. To get a license to carry a concealed firearm in my state requires $20 and a few weeks while they do a cursory background check, depending on the county. To get a handgun or rifle takes half an hour for a phone call background check.<p>If politicians like Sen. Feinstein would stop talking about banning weapons wholesale that had nothing to do with any recent tragedy, and instead talk about a national level of firearms reciprocity (while requiring locations like NYC, Chicago and DC to come up to par), you'd see folks on the Right move quickly and decisively to supporting more common sense gun regulations.",1355850145

It sounds like a sign of true independence for the man who ""thinks for himself"", but what does that really mean?<p>As I grew in maturity I realized the foolishness of that statement, because nobody truly ""thinks for themselves"".  Sure, we're using our own brain to enact a decision unique to ourselves, but the vast complexities of how we are influenced by others and our own past - through parents, family, friends, actions (or inaction), stories, the books we've read, the movies/TV we watch, the music lyrics we listen to (I could go on) - really means that our decision-making is heavily skewed by the influences we have consciously, or otherwise, allowed to shape our minds.  It really makes you wonder how much we can truly ""think for ourselves""<p>Once I realized the notion that ""thinking for myself"" is really just a fantasy, I started to understand the importance of the old phrase ""GIGO"" and how important it is to choose (as best as possible) who will influence my thought processes.  With that said, I think it's more than wise to look to masters in every arena of life for wisdom and influence to help us to ""think for ourselves"" when the time for choice arrives.",1355850057

600740,comment,600281,600472,0,0,alain94040,,,"<i>underestimating Google</i>? I place Google pretty high up on the scale of having smart people. Really high. Like #2. Actually, the only people that can beat extremely bright engineers at this game are mathematicians. That's what Wolfram does (remember, Mathematica?).<p>The complexity that mathematicians can compute is at least an order higher than engineers. Think of Linus vs. grandma struggling with 3 lines of HTML. The same gap is between the brightest of engineers and a good mathematician.<p>So that's why I place Wolfram #1 and Google #2, for that particular space (computation). But if you are a bright engineer and never got exposed to good mathematicians, you may just not even be aware that there is all this realm of knowledge above your head.",1241846480
600739,comment,600668,600668,0,0,gcv,,,"About 18 months ago, I ported a project I was working on from C to C++. I, too, wanted a few C++ features to simplify life, mainly to use the STL, but also for inheritance in a handful of places. I got what I wanted, but I have since concluded that switch to C++ was, on the whole, a mistake.<p>First, don't discount the longer compilation times. After learning Lisp, I became rather addicted to the rapid turn-around time of compiling code at the level of individual functions. I can tolerate C because, with a relatively clean build setup, it compiles quickly. g++ on my project is between 10 and 20 times slower than gcc. This means that, as I make minor changes, I'm more likely to have to wait a while for a build to finish. This means I'm more likely to slack off in between builds. This kills (my) productivity horribly.<p>Second, auxiliary tool support on Unix leaves a lot to be desired. I sprinkle my code with templates in places where they promote readability, and I use STL containers. gdb, at least the version I'm using, does not support displaying data in STL containers. This means that when I have to track down a problem with data in a map, gdb can't help me. I have run into nasty problems for which I had to write custom print-this-templated-structure-to-log code. In addition, g++ error messages which involve templates absolutely suck. Luckily, I can quickly figure out what I need to change just by looking at the affected line.<p>After thinking through these issues, I concluded that C++ wasted more of my time than it saved. YMMV, of course.",1241846434

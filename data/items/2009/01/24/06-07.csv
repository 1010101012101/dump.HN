I know that I am most productive around the afternoon, so if it was shut down then, it might make a difference in my productivity. If it was shut down around 9:30-11:00 p.m., it probably wouldn't do much for my productivity because I'm not usually doing much work anyway at that time. This would of course depend on traffic peak and where most of the users were located.",1232780001

The funny thing is that I jumped on the CSS bandwagon early (Netscape 4 era) because of the obvious benefits.  Now I find myself disgusted at what the community has become.<p>They live in their inbred web standards blog world where they have a very polished view of what is ""semantic"" and what it means to separate content and presentation.  All the while completely oblivious to the ecosystem in which web standards live and the constant tradeoffs that must be made in any software system.<p>Ignoring what should be obvious: there's precious little semantic information in an HTML document.  The standardized tags are all but completely presentational.  Naming CSS classes strictly according to some pedantic definition of ""semantic"" meaning ""not presentational"" is deluded.  First, because we add classes to things because need a hook for presentational purposes.  Second, because 99% of the time, the actual goals of writing HTML/CSS are presentation, concision, maintainability, and maybe SEO.  It turns out you should name your classes descriptively, which may align with a semanticist's notion of best practice 80% of the time.  But then the remaining 20% of the time they'll rip you new one for use class=""red"" instead of using a half-dozen ""semantically pure"" names like class=""slightly_more_important_block"", class=""second_heading_in_a_row"", class=""something_i_just_want_to_be_different"", class=""sometimes_i_just_want_to_be_different"", class=""why_web_design_sucks_in_96"" and class=""i_love_you_man""",1232778891

447831,comment,446881,447684,0,0,celoyd,,,"On spirituality: Yes, a lot of thinking about global warming resembles apocalypticism and moral panic. Some of it is downright horrifying. But that people argue for something incorrectly doesn't make it incorrect. (And apocalypticism and moral panic are presumably adaptive behaviors.)<p>On acceptance of engineering solutions: Are they really verboten among more than a few factions? Do you have numbers on how many people are an in the alarmist category v. AGW believers like me who accept or encourage engineering solutions? I don't, but I bet it's not as bad as you suggest. Alarmists, like all borderline kooks, are overrepresented in the press because they're fun to read about. I think almost all of us are sane enough that we want the best solution to what we think is a serious problem.<p>On environmentalism pork in AGW policy: This is a problem. Some of that ethanol stuff, for example, is reminiscent of the rumors that drafts of the Patriot Act had been sitting on a shelf for hears. But for some other measures, there's a more charitable interpretation of the fact that environmentaists were asking for them before we were at the point of crisis.",1232778699

447820,comment,447435,447435,0,0,RobGR,,,"I used Plan9 for a while, I had a project going with some other people that involved a lot of distributed access, and Plan9 was pitched as solving a lot of our problems from the start, that we would have to hack around if we used anything else.  (I describe the project down below, for the curious.)<p>The title, ""Plan9: why no compelling successor to Unix has gotten of the ground"" presumes that Plan9 is better than Unix.  Plan9 sucks, and is a waste of your time.<p>The thesis of this article is that Plan9 was better than Linux, but Linux was good enough no one had a big enough reason to switch to go to the trouble; this fails to take into account that Plan9 was dead before Linux ever got out the door.<p>One reason for that was the license.  For a while it was under some Bell Labs license that no one was sure was ""open source"" or not.  As the Lucent took over the labs, and then had troubles itself, there was a lot of uncertainty about it.  At some point the license was changed or clarified or something, and the new license could possibly be interpreted as allowing you to re-license it under the GPL, and there were rumours and hints that Rob Pike or some other iconic figure had told someone the goal of the license was to allow that, but it was obfuscated to get it past corporate lawyers. That didn't inspire confidence.<p>At one point in my life, I am embarassed to say, my goal was to spend the next year sitting down and reading every single source file in Plan9, putting a GPL or LGPL license on it, and then re-distribute ""Plan9-GPL"".  I was convinced the license allowed it, and I figured that if I did it and was the obvious target for a law suit from Lucent and I was not sued, then Plan9 would take off.  One good thing about Plan9 is that the total number of lines of code is low, one person could do that.  However, like other powerful computer systems, sometimes there is a lot packed in few lines.<p>The user interface is worse than TWM.  It's main editor basically requires that you constantly have one hand on the mouse and hunt and peck keys with the other hand, as if it was designed by one of those old computer illiterate people who can't type and clutch the mouse in a death grip the entire time they are in front of the computer.  Certain people in the Plan9 ""community"" talk about rio like it is something better than Windows 2.0 or Commodore 64 GEM, and make a lot of jwz-like snarky comments about X, but it isn't.<p>I suspect the reason for this is that no one actually uses Plan9 on a daily basis.  The headers of emails on the 9fans mailing list indicate that everyone except for a few holdouts uses Outlook.  I think they edit their files in windows, and copy them to Plan9 via ftp or samba.<p>I wanted to document how to set up a ""node"" for our project in painstaking detail.  As a result, I repeatedly wipped a disk using dd if=/dev/zero from tom's root boot floppy, and re-installed again.  A few weeks into my experimenting, they updated Plan9 and it lost the ability to write the MBR, so I had to fdisk from a linux each time.  This remained a bug for nearly two years, causing me to realize that in all probability, no one in the Plan9 developer community was installing any new computers.<p>That was a shock to me, as I had invested a lot of money in hardware that would run Plan9 (specific video cards and wireless cards, mostly) and a HUGE amount of time.  When I saw some poor dude post on the 9fans mailing list 18 months later or whatever wondering why Plan 9 wouldn't boot after a clean disk install, I knew it was dead and that all that time was wasted.<p>I believe that most instances of Plan9 are currently run in VMWare on Windows desktops.  If you are doing operating system research, and operating systems are the interface between application code and hardware, and you need a two layers of closed source between you and the hardware just to get started, you have failed.<p>It may have once been a framework for some cutting edge experiments in operating systems, and maybe still is.  The C compiler it has is fast and nice, at least compared to gcc of the 2002 era or so.  If I had some reason to write a C compiler, I would dig up the 9c code and take a look at it, and possibly start there.<p>I liked a lot of Plan9's ideas, but the whole experience made me appreciate linux a lot more.  I don't think that Linux needs to take the best ideas from Plan9, Plan9 needs to steal the mediocre ideas from Linux -- like command completion, how about porting emacs or vi or nano, the basic stuff that allows you to get to working on the cool stuff.<p>The people involved with Plan9 seem very interested in the interface between application code and the operating system, and less interested in the operating system -- that's why they run Plan9 in Xen on a Linux computer.  However, for people interested in that, they don't seem write much code that uses that interaction.<p>========<p>P.S.: The project was to make this giant tit-for-tat resources trading system - we were starting with wireless access, so that if a person put up a wireless access point, you could use it only if you had a wireless access point at your house that was also open to the first person to use; next we were going to do offsite storage, so you would make a few gigs available to the system, and get a quota of a few back, but your stuff would be distributed and replicated accross many other people's drives thus resistent to disasters; and then a cpu trading thing similar to folding@home type systems; and so on.  There was no business plan, our goal was to change the world not get rich (the participants came out of Austin's Cypherpunks group).  We had a lot of excitement and hype going on, and it died due to interpersonal fighting (if you know the Cypherpunks from that time period you know what I'm talking about).",1232777686

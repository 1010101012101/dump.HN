There is plenty of choice and it is not like 37Signals dominates in any way.  They are far from the dominate leader in there space (and they don't claim to be).<p>I don't believe they have a lifestyle business, they have a very good business that is profitable and growing.  They might not claim to be out marketing & promoting, but it sure does seem like they have plenty of marketing and promotion through ""submarine"" tactics rather then overt (here is our ad) methods.",1213217841

If everyone that upmods actually thinks the posts are valuable enough to upmod based on the content and thinks that other users would benefit from the content, then that’s fine; it’s just that there’s a lot of great content out there, and it seems as though certain posts get upmodded more simply based upon the source.<p>The upvotes that people give this ""joke"" (it’s not really meant to be funny at all), regardless of how often they’ve heard it before, probably means that they agree with the sentiment, and as members of the same community have the option to make that vote as they see fit. Hopefully they don’t upmod because they find the post humorous. It’s meant to be commentary on the state of the community, and your negative responses only seem to validate the point further.<p>Interesting how the net’s anonymity results in much sharper criticism than you find the real world. For example, you would never call a joke stupid if someone you had just met told it, regardless of how many times you’d heard it before. Something to consider, especially given that we’re all here to focus on the same goal: learning from one another, gaining valuable insight, growing as a community. Not disrespecting one another.<p>I may not have been a registered user for very long, but I have read HN for quite a long time before that, and am just as immersed and interested in the startup community as any one of you. I agree that, if anyone cares about karma, a formula that gives karma based upon length of time they’ve been a registered member of the community is a cool idea..

Microsoft isn't either, and yet they were able to REDUCE costs by getting a custom-designed processor for the XBox360 (yes, I know that had its share of flaws).<p>Intel doesn't do custom designs, that isn't their business model. There are some companies that specialize in that sort of thing, like IBM. There are a number of fabless semiconductor developers that have been quite successful this way, including nVidia. Even SUN doesn't do its own semiconductor manufacturing, for years they relied on TI for that part.<p>Also, Apple acquired the company PA Semiconductor, which includes several folks with a lot of experience in designing processors (some of their products were among the best in the business, like the Alpha series), so it's not like Apple would be starting from ground zero here.<p>I'm not sure that it's necessary, but if Apple wants custom functionality for upcoming mobile products, it might be worth it in the long run. If they just wanted inexpensive, high-performance, general-purpose processors, the best route for the foreseeable future is probably to stick with x86. I don't think it's likely however that x86 will be able to compete with the ARM in the ARM's niche anytime soon though.",1213215241

Of course you can already do the same sort of things with JavaScript. If SquirrelFish makes it to the iPhone (it would be silly not to) all JavaScript apps will receive a huge boost in performance.<p>Plus Flash most likely wouldn't have access to many of the features native iPhone apps do.<p>Jobs simply hates Flash and Java. I talked to someone who did some advertising work for Apple, and they had some Flash thing that Steve needed to approve, but supposedly he <i>refuses</i> to install Flash on his computer, so they had to do a screencast just for him.",1213215099

They're not growing on trees (last I looked from my perch).  A couple of questions for you to think about.<p>Do you have the experience in the space you are trying to attack?  If not, you best be looking for someone, either technical or not, who does, who can speak to the market, and investors about the market (or angels FROM the market).  Also, what's your next milestone?  Is it your first paying customer, or is it a demo that will not be launch ready?  What will his/her first milestone be?  Is there enough work at present to keep a biz person busy in exchange for the equity?  There will ALWAYS be enough todo's on the list of the developers...  In short, are you sure you're ready for a non-technical founder?<p>BTW: my cofounder is non-technical (I'm sure he'd love to see me describe him as such).  I asked him aboard before I'd written even a hundred lines of code.  Why?  Because he knows the market well and has professional experience / knowledge that I, or likely any other hacker, couldn't hope to pick up in any reasonable amount of time.

5748974,comment,5748365,5748475,4,0,lotharbot,,,"You're exactly right.  When I try to make myself look attractive, I aspire to my own standards (and my wife's).  When others try to make themselves look attractive, they aspire to their different standards.  We modify a lot of things about our own looks, which may not be as blatant as hair dye: clothing, hairstyle, makeup, facial hair, eyewear, and of course our own facial expressions.  This means others have a lot of opportunity to boost themselves according to their standards, and penalize themselves according to mine.<p>Likewise, I'm more likely to have a ""good life"" than others by my own definition.  I'm more likely to be ""educated"" than others in the fields which I consider education important.  I'm more likely to find the ""right balance"" between work and family, or between present and future, or between hope and realism, because I'm aspiring to exactly the point which I consider ""right"".<p>Generally, people tend to do better according to their own standards than others' standards, and are thus more likely to be ""above average"".",1369198786

What I've learned personally is that efficient programmers who plan things out and focus on best practice tend to keep their code very DRY and understandable for others to catch onto. The sloppy programmers end up having to race to the deadline in order to refactor and sometimes redo their code because the end result was close but not correct enough for passing to a client. While I like the idea of saying ""f-it"" let me program I love thinking about efficient problem solving, it actually makes me continue to think and IMHO makes me a better programmer.",1369198768

5748971,comment,5748766,5748925,2,0,lifthrasiir,,,"I have once used OneTab. In the end, it was totally useless for me since it completely destroyed my external memory in the form of browser tabs. Hiding inactive tabs was definitely an wrong solution.<p>My two cents: The human behavior on tabs is surprisingly akin to garbage collection. Therefore I think we need some solution inspired by the incremental, generational GC. Gradually disappearing tabs may be such solution, for example. Many tabs are created in a group, and such group is garbage-collected altogether; pinned tabs behave like a statically allocated memory; the GC has to be able to determine if the tab is created in the context of other tabs or it is independent to others; if <i>I</i> don't want tabs to be disappeared then I can go to the tab for the extended period to signal the GC not to hide this tab for now; etc.",1369198730
5748970,comment,5747961,5748212,1,0,stcredzero,,,"<i>> That's dangerous, because you have no way of knowing if you have 100% coverage without doing static analysis</i><p>You are right from a theoretical standpoint, but I'm not so sure this fits with how web applications are known to run and the patterns development usually follows.<p>Developers who shove an object of one type in an instance or temporary variable one time, and a different one another time are usually doing something bad, even in dynamic environments -- unless there is a specific interface involved. Just because ""duck typing"" is fast, doesn't mean that it has to be loose.<p>The point, actually, is to discover where types are being misused as much as to discover what the types are.<p><i>> The lesson is: don't let tools change code semantics based only on black-box testing.</i><p>I'm also advocating this. However, it seems like you're mainly familiar with dealing with types in statically typed environments. In dynamic environments, the developers still need to know the types. Often, there are hard and fast rules only enforced by convention. This is indeed a source of errors, but by and large, programmers are very good at managing this. In other words, very often, the programmers will <i>know</i>. I see environments like Dart as a way to eliminate such conventions, but still enable very fast prototyping in the beginning. (Ultimately, static types are better for maintenance.)",1369198724

5748967,comment,5748856,5748856,3,0,btilly,,,"I assume you mean programming language.<p>If you're a programmer, it is good to periodically learn the basics of new languages.  You won't be expert in them, but it is less work than you probably fear, you'll know how to find your way around, and you'll come back to your main languages with greater perspective.<p>Whether it makes sense to learn one for your startup is a different question.  Beware of the fact that while working on a startup there will always be plenty of opportunities to engage in yak shaving.  (See <a href=""http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gs...</a> if you don't know what yak shaving is.)  Letting yourself get consistently sidetracked is a quick way to fail to produce anything.<p><i>However</i> it is also true that there are many technologies that your startup might benefit from which require you to know specific languages.  For example you might want to use Puppet, but that requires you to know some Ruby, which you might not know.  (Ditto Chef and Python in the same problem space - so you get a choice of new languages to learn!)<p>With all of that said, here is my answer.  Ask yourself why you want to learn the language, what the benefit will be, and how long you'd give yourself to do so or pull the plug.  Decide that up front.  If you decide that it is a worthwhile investment of your time, then plunge in, but DON'T TRY TO MASTER IT!  Instead recognize that for whatever you need to do you likely only need to understand some <i>subset</i> of the language.  Try to identify that subset, learn that, and then get done what you need to get done.  (A reasonable way to learn that subset is to focus on learning what seems necessary to start working on your problem, then learn everything that you encounter as a blocker while trying to solve said problem.)<p>But put boxes and limits around this task.  Because your goal should be to get something out there and iterate.  Anything that distracts you from that goal needs to be removed for that goal.",1369198702

5748963,comment,5747961,5748784,1,0,dietrichepp,,,"When I started seriously working with JavaScript, I decided to try to conform to community standards by using JSLint.  I was shocked by how terrible JSLint was.  It offered corrections for very straightforward constructs such as:<p><pre><code>    var count = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (some_func(i)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
I have no idea why JSLint would tell me that I should move the definition of ""i"" to the top of the function (am I supposed to pretend I'm writing ANSI C for obsolete compilers?) and its insistence that ""++"" is evil in both uses above is equally ridiculous.<p>I love static analysis, I like tools that automatically format source code (indent, go fmt, emacs), but JSLint is just annoying.",1369198624

(1) This is just semantics, but the compiler is not ""smart"" and does not ""figure out"" types.  It uses a straightforward type unification algorithm (should feel natural to anyone who's programmed in Prolog) with a monomorphism restriction.  (2) The type annotations you add may be different than the types that the compiler would deduce in their absence, and these annotations may in fact be necessary in order for the program to be correct.<p>Your question about Lisp has already been answered, but I will expand.  The type checking can be done at runtime, at compile time, or at some combination of bothit is not always possible to deduce the type of function arguments at compile time in a language like Lisp.  Obviously, (+ 1 ""ABC"") is an error, but not all situations are so obvious.

At this point in my life (late 20s), my time is one of my most valuable resources.  So, the last thing I want to do is spend that time effectively preparing for a data structures and algorithms exam.  Each time I sit down to brush up on the details of Prim's algorithm or the exact implementation of quicksort, my eyes glaze over and I start thinking about how I'd much rather be building or tinkering with something.  So that's what I end up doing.  The interesting thing is that actually building stuff is good enough to get you an interview, and, even though you've proven that you can actually code, you get funneled through the same inane interview process.<p>And here's the kicker: none of this truly indicates if you have an exceptional software developer on your hands or not.

Meanwhile, I know several excellent engineers who were rejected.  Everyone knows the process only kind of works.<p>SV loves to complain about a talent shortage.

Who made the call for the case to be reinstated? Airbnb is a great service, I don't see why local Governments like New York are so against the idea. I can see why personal driver services like Uber are somewhat under scrutiny, but the only person who has something to lose is the owner of the property being rented out on Airbnb, not the person staying nor the city the property resides in. The whole situation reeks of lobbyist propaganda and cash.",1369196335

You don't need the Dart VM built into a browser for your Dart application to work; it already works today.<p><i>What would it take to get these vendors to add support?</i><p>I think that likely they would want to see more applications written in Dart. If a big company (like Facebook, for example) wrote a large application in Dart, other browser vendors would see both that big name developers are using Dart for their applications and they'd see the performance boost that browsers with the Dart VM built in take advantage of[2]. This would make it more compelling for them to include a Dart VM in their browser.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.dartlang.org/2013/03/why-dart2js-produces-faster-javascript.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.dartlang.org/2013/03/why-dart2js-produces-faster...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://dartlang.org/performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dartlang.org/performance</a>",1369195934

But I see Dart more as a <i>refined/upgraded</i> Javascript -- some additional language/toolset features like Objective-C or C++ do for C.<p>Advantages of Dart over Node.js or CoffeeScript or plain Javascript?<p>1. ""Batteries included"" -- instead of reliance upon assortment of modules, OO system built in, better DOM utilities than jQuery (query returns a first class object), functional like Javascript sans the <i>function</i> keyword).<p>2. So nice that you can split a project across a whole bunch of code files, yet it will condense and minify into one efficient javascript file. Yes, there are tools with all the various Javascript frameworks to accomplish this, but then you're reliant upon of hierarchical library dependencies that sometimes can be brittle.<p>3. Can run server side just as Node.js with a powerful VM, without the need (though certainly possible and optional) to install a plethora of other libraries.<p>I think it hasn't taken off because up until recent months, the language  and library has not been stable enough for production development -- libraries have changed a lot and most of the code in all of the Dart books published to date will not run at all now (though the Dart SDK comes with a tool that can help migrating code).<p>There are still some sore spots I hope get addressed -- primarily, on server side, need for built-in DB libraries and on client side, JSONP/CORS that is as easy as jQuery makes it.

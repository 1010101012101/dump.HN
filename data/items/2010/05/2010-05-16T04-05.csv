But even in the long term, let's imagine that every stoner in the United States has undeniable proof of their ongoing possession and use of marijuana made public. What's more likely to happen--that the DEA will swoop in to arrest <i>all</i> of them or society will realize that would be silly and hypocritical?

Second generation cleaned up the design a bit, was at least competitive on price, and had a feature that iPod's <i>still to this day don't have</i>: the ability to sync wirelessly...<p>...but was Microsoft ever really that into Zune?

If they were really determined, I think they could've beaten Apple.<p>But, then, if they were really determined I think they'd have to do something radical...like change their name. I mean, come on!

Sure, changing their name would mean throwing away practically priceless brand identity, but I'll bet you it would improve their ability to compete with Apple in the consumer electronics market. What's that you say? They'd be stupid to toss the brand behind their Windows/Office monopoly just to compete in consumer electronics? Well, maybe...maybe they don't <i>really</i> want to kill the iPod...maybe the Zune was a half-hearted, ultimately misguided attempt...<p>...maybe they don't have the <i>guts</i>. I did hear about this one company that changed its name and abandoned the best selling personal music player so that they could introduce a new model with less capacity at a higher price because they believed that flash technology was better than mini-hardrives and then held their announce their annual developers' conference wouldn't cover their operating system even as sales of it are better then they've ever been before...<p>GUTS!",1273985815

Maybe what you are saying is that most programmers aren't good enough to build those kinds of products, or would just rather stick to their knitting and weaving. That I would agree with.<p>Most of those were huge projects, but if you break them up in to little pieces some of them were artwork, most of them were bricks.

Your tastes only narrow and exclude people. so create.""<p>As for the programming is a science or art debate: It is' of course wrong to make such a dichotomy. People who draw a thick boundary between these two, I think, appreciate neither art or science. Programming <i>is</i> a science, it's true, but it also is a thing of beauty, much as a game of Go, or a beautiful mathematical theorem. Any scientific endevour you do passionately is worth to be called an art, I think (and vice versa). Let us not make the mistake that John Keating makes when he says:<p>""We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, ""O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless... of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?"" Answer.

I refused to join Mensa even after I could have, does that make me ""not gifted""?<p>I think the truth of the matter lies somewhere in the uninteresting middle, and depends a lot on what school you go to, how much you apply yourself, and other factors. Sure, you might learn some things from school. Are these really things that you couldn't learn outside of university walls?<p>Just saying that a Bachelor's degree isn't helpful to a lot of people doesn't make anyone anti-intellectual, any more than advocating squeaking through a 4 year degree in ""University Studies"" at Podunk U. makes you pro-intellectual. Being an intellectual is a mindset. A Bachelors degree is a piece of paper that says you did whatever was required to get said piece of paper, which probably didn't involve being an intellectual 100% of the time. That what's I was trying to get at with my unfortunately-snarky-sounding Mensa comment above.<p>I realize that this part of your comment might actually have been suggesting that if we declare a Bachelors as useless for a bunch of people, the masses will decide that stupidity is an acceptable state of being. If that's the case, I think we should be honest and admit that someone squeezing through a crap degree just because everyone says he should isn't going to cure him of whatever problem allows him to look at learning  and knowledge with such a care-free attitude. If someone isn't capable of understanding why learning is important or, worse, is looking for any excuse they can find to tear down people who value education, there's a problem that's being ignored way before they even think about entering college.",1273984867

1351383,comment,1313791,1346100,0,0,jemfinch,,,"> When people talk about ""genericness"", or ""generic programming"" in front of me, the first example they give to me is the parametric polymorphism of the STL.<p>The STL embodies (and accomplishes) far more than parametric polymorphism.  As far as I know there is no other language with as comprehensive a collection of <i>container-independent</i> algorithms in the standard library.<p>> The fact that template are Turing complete doesn't hide the restrictions they come with (like how they interact with inheritance). I know they have others goals than mere parametric polymorphism. I even admit that I don't understand these goals. I just say that one goal wasn't met: simple parametric polymorphism.<p>And you're still wrong.  Templates achieve parametric polymorphism <i>and more</i>.  I can write a simple, templated, singly-linked list class in C++ which can do everything the same `'a list` in ML can do.<p>> About lambda lifting being a (simple) syntactical transformation, please stop. You're right, but in a trivial sense: every compilation process is a (less simple) syntactical transformation. That includes lambda lifting, ghc's crazy optimizer, and every static compiler on this planet.<p>I was making a greater claim that you seem to understand.  Lambda lifting is a <i>simple</i> syntactical transformation.  I can explain the entire transformation in a paragraph or less.  I can offer example code of the transformation off the top of my head with ease.  All lambda lifting does is make explicit what closures allow to remain implicit.<p>Your following two paragraphs are a fairly obvious attempt to change your original, wrong statement into something defensible.<p>> So, a language without lambdas doesn't treat functions as first class citizens.<p>Ridiculous.  A language without lambdas is just that: a language without lambdas.  Remove lambda from Python, and you remove only the ability of a Python programmer to define unnamed functions.  Functions remain first class; their binding rules remain exactly the same.  The <i>only</i> difference is that now programmers must give a name to all their functions.",1273984488

Has any critic in any field, maybe since John Ruskin? I know Ebert has had a rebirth in the tech community with his speech synthesizer and Twitter account, but really the guy opined on a syndicated basic cable and newspaper column for 25 years. His only significant innovation is the ""Thumbs Up/Down"" rating. Certainly famous, but influential or valuable? At least as it relates to a comparison with film makers of the day?<p>As a thought experiment, think of all the movies you can for the last 25 years, good, bad, weird. Probably a fairly large list. Now think of all the insights, or ""Thumbs"" ratings you can remember from Ebert? Or any other critic? How do they match up?",1273983462

You could also get out and talk to your potential customers, find out what their problems are and what it would take to solve them, then build what THEY think is right. The nice side effect is you'll already know who the consumer is.<p>As a customer, I do have a stake in something when I put down my credit card. If a company doesn't respect me as their customer, you bet I will not be repeating my business.<p>However, the business can (and SHOULD) decide if they want me as a customer.

It's simple enough (ignoring the more complicated mappers) that it can be described fairly easily, and serves as a good example of implementing an emulator for a 2d console.  As for the programming language, I'm having a tough time figuring out how best to present the examples to people; generally I write emulators in languages with heavy metaprogramming, e.g. Nemerle, Boo, Scheme, but these are all fairly tough for a standard programmer to learn along with emulation.

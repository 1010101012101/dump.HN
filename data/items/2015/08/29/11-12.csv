If you&#x27;re interested in working with good people, you should be coaching your staff to develop their skills. That process makes it fairly apparent to you who&#x27;s a good performer and who isn&#x27;t, and who wants to improve and who doesn&#x27;t.<p>If someone&#x27;s getting to fifteen years, for example, and only then discovering that they&#x27;ve got to make cuts and don&#x27;t <i>know</i> who to keep.

There&#x27;s two ways this is apparent:<p>1. They are able to use dedicated tools other people have written. Those tools exist because the problems they solve have been faced with many other companies before, and someone sat down and developed a product for it.<p>2. They employ a lot of juniors (which is why they are big), and are able to offload a lot of the routine tasks in a project to those juniors (called &quot;leverage&quot; in professional services). Unless you&#x27;re very high up in your organization yourself (e.g. C-level), it&#x27;s likely that those juniors are the &quot;consultants&quot; you see. The types of tasks you describe (writing simple scripts and creating PowerPoint presentations) are exactly the types of things a junior would be charged with.<p>In contrast, high-end consultancies tend to be small, and they consist almost entirely of highly skilled and experienced people, who are often times partners or equivalent. They often have to write their own tools and develop their own processes and best practices due to the relatively unique nature of the issues they tackle.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: all good consultants are also very good salespeople.

First, the issues that were resolved was making wording clearer because the FSF was concerned that it was confusing. There was no fundamental changes to principles of the policy so there should be no implication that Canonical was somehow falling foul of GPL licensing. For clarity, as the post you linked to shows the FSF would like more done.<p>Second, the comparison to RedHat is completely unfair because the two companies follow fundamentally different strategies. Ubuntu has a single code-base, RedHat has a commercial and a free code-base. This means Ubuntu has a single IP policy to deal with both commercial and free usage. Whereas you sign a standard commercial subscription agreement, or a different agreement if you use RHEL in other ways. For clarity, I&#x27;m not besmirching either approach, I&#x27;m explaining the context of difference [0].<p>Thanks for adding that they were fixed.<p>I think you were generally trying to support this point:<p>&quot;I suspect quite a few Redhat employees will take strong offense to your comments on them not caring about Free Software&quot;<p>Which I fundamentally agree with you on.

Disclaimer: I&#x27;m no sources of power expert ;) Just a person who&#x27;s intrigued.<p>- Meditation: nowadays it seems a bit more mainstream, but I still think doing Vipassana or other body-scan related techniques is a source of power. The idea of emotional intelligence felt like a concept, but when I actually felt a tangible improvement, I understood the concept intuitively.<p>- Mental simulation: this is more a generalization of meditation. But if psychology shows you can learn to play piano just by vividly imagining it, it has merit, since you can now learn it anywhere.<p>- Specialized communities: Hacker News is a prime example. It&#x27;s the first time I learned so much about tech (despite studying CS). Evaluating a community is a matter of its own though.<p>- Interdisciplinarity: this is more domain specific but it works for me in uni. I learned my academic writing thanks to psychology classes and learned LaTeX from CS. Combining the two allowed me to improve my writing in ways I never imagined. A natural consequence is that I get higher grades during interdisciplinary courses (e.g. serious games).<p>- Geo-arbitrage: we all know this one. Living in a cheap country (e.g. somewhere in Asia), while working for an expensive country such as the US.<p>- Good peer to peer teaching: I owe all most of my dating skills to one person who taught me after years of small successes and reading a lot on the topic. Finding the right teacher is the hard part.<p>- Six degrees to separation: I tried it once as an experiment. I didn&#x27;t reach the person I wanted to reach, I was impatient as well.

For example, machine learning algorithms to write awesome music to MIDI and then you adapt it to your taste as a music producer.<p>- Game development for the Rift: it&#x27;s not massively adopted yet and game-design approaches need to be reinvented a bit.<p>Anyone who wants to share or give feedback? :)",1440847049

Forgive me for a bit of a rant, but I think that understanding how to interpret this story actually helps make his point better.<p>The message isn&#x27;t to be innocent of scientific knowledge -- it&#x27;s to be innocent of evil. And that evil is immediately made manifest not just in Eve blaming the snake, but perhaps more heinously by Adam blaming not only Eve but God: &quot;The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate&quot;. Adam and Eve demonstrate a renunciation of self responsiblity and ultimately, of the gift of free will that they have been given, for the sake of trying to falsely appear blameless. Contrast this with the new Adam, Christ, who takes the blame of others upon Himself (even though He is blameless) demonstrating not just His divinity but _what humanity truly is_.<p>So we see that the message of the fall, once fully illumined by Christ, is really that we ought to love one another by covering one another&#x27;s sins (isn&#x27;t this forgiveness?) It is in this that we become God-like: not by simply eating of the tree. And if we use only our rational minds we might not ever arrive at this point, because to make oneself responsible for things one isn&#x27;t responsible for -- whether it is problems others face or the outright wrong things other people have done -- is beyond rationality and is instead both truly human and divine.",1440846945

Today, the view is much more nuanced. Science is based on a few assumptions and interpretations that have been the study of what&#x27;s known as the philosophy of science[1]. Just to get a taste of the difficulty of going from science to knowledge, read about epistemology and, especially, the Gettier problem[2]. The paradox raised by the Gettier problem is not interesting in and of itself, but it strongly ties what we know or think we know about the world, to what we are and what we think.<p>This inseparable connection is a source of more modern views on the relationship between science and knowledge, like phenomenology[2]. If you want to translate these views back to scientific, or mathematical terms, you can see the essential problem a brain — i.e. a computer — introduces into the universe. Due to universal computation, a universe may contain a material approximation (that it is just a finite approximation matters little) that is more general than the containing universe itself (as it can contain any universe), and thus more general than the laws of nature, which are particular to the “host” universe. This makes subjective experience, namely the inner workings of the computer, not secondary to objective experience, namely the laws of the host universe. The mechanical construction of the computer bears little relevance to the to the computation -- or simulation -- the software is carrying out. Truth, therefore, can mean different things depending on which universe you are talking about, and neither can be said to be secondary to the other.<p>The scientific method has, obviously, been extremely useful in uncovering certain types of truths, and extremely unhelpful in uncovering others, that cannot be said to be of less import. Since we live in a world constructed by our software, it makes little sense to say that it is the laws of the host universe that matter more (except in the sense that they can kill us, or interfere with the software, but that only makes them important -- not supremely important).<p>[0]: Although the modern reincarnation justifies itself through utility rather than a deeper philosophical justification, namely, science is useful in the physical world, hence science is the &quot;best&quot; form of knowledge (accepting the supremacy of the physical world as either an axiom, or a materialist belief that smooths over definitions of reduction). You can call this &quot;utilitarian epistemology&quot;, namely the view that &#x27;what we know is what we can use&#x27;.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)</a>",1440846366

As a co-founder in a startup with a VC funding, now, I&#x27;m realizing that doing it without VC funding can be even better idea.

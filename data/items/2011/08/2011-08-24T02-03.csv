This isn't the best, but it's not the worst, either, at least not if the interviewer expects a conversation rather than a ""perfect"" answer.<p>If you fail the interview because you assumed ""integer"" meant the wrong thing, then maybe you deserved to fail. You should have asked what the interviewer meant. They could have meant mathematical integers (possibly only positive ones), 32-bit ints, 16-bit ints, ""bignum""-style integers, etc.  If you fail to ask for clarification, then at best you deserve to have the interviewer choose a different definition and then reveal that after you've wasted time assuming 32-bit ints. Ask for clarification and don't simply assume when there are multiple possibilities.<p>And you're neither correct nor especially clever for answering 2^32 if the interviewer tells you the question is about 32-bit unsigned ints. 2^32 is not a valid unsigned 32-bit int.

2919226,story,,,1,0,caffeine5150,"Why does the iphone lack basic setting apps?",,"I recently switched from an Android Incredible to an Iphone 3.  The Android was not as stable as the Iphone but the platform had some very useful utility apps - namely, there were (many) apps that would allow me to adjust the screen brightness from the home screen, which I need to do regularly.  Incidentally, the auto brightness really worked on the Android and seems to do nothing on the Iphone.  Also, there was an app to show the state of and quickly cycle the ringer between off, on, & vibrate.  (I am constantly forgetting to turn back on my ringer switch and it's odd to me that there is no indication on the screen of its state.)  Beyond that generally, the Android seemed to have much more of these types of practical utilities. My question is, from a developer perspective, is there a reason that Iphone apps seem to skew toward 'soft' or 'fun' applications and lack such basic utilities?  Or is it just that Iphone doesn't allow developers to access such settings?",1314153695

Closures, that is, the implementation structure which stores along with a code pointer the references or values to which local variables referenced by said code are bound, have been in Java since version <i>1.0</i>.  Otherwise you could not write code such as:<p>class foo { final static int bar = 6; static class baz { int bla() { return bar; } } }<p>and expect ""(new foo.baz()).bla()"" to return 6.<p>What Java <i>is</i> missing (and I suspect what the author is conflating closures with) are <i>anonymous functions</i>, which require closures to function properly for the same reason inner classes require closures.<p><i>Closures are not anonymous functions.</i> Closures are an <i>implementation detail</i> which allow anonymous functions (among other structures) to act as expected in statically-scoped languages.<p>Scheme has anonymous functions and closures.<p>Java does not have anonymous functions but <i>does</i> have closures.<p>Emacs Lisp has anonymous functions but does <i>not</i> have closures (and thus does not exhibit static scope).<p>BASIC has neither anonymous functions nor closures.<p>(It is worthwhile to note that there are other methods for implementing static scope such as alpha-renaming but they are usually much less efficient than closures.)",1314153484

A more serious issue, as an example, is that good teachers are actively driven away by petty bureaucrats. Those that remain are severely constrained in the good they can do. With the advent of endemic standardized testing tied into bonuses and tenure, classes have devolved into regurgitate the answer mode. That issue, of really excellent  teaching being punished or prohibited, is only one of many many problems in the system. Easy fixes don't work because there is not just one thing that is the problem.

Paying with a monthly data cap effectively overlays an economic decision over each interaction you have with the internet. ""Do I click this link? How much bandwidth will that use?""  Even though I think most people probably would end up not thinking about it on a link-by-link basis, they do have to devote some mental power to monitoring how much of their data cap they've used, how much they have left in the current billing cycle (especially under billing regimes that charge way higher marginal costs when you exceed the initial cap - e.g. most US mobile phone voice minute plans).<p>It's just annoying.  Even though it seems like tying the price of something to your use of that thing is the most efficient way to bill, it just sucks because then you have to think too much about every use: text messages, AOL hours, phone calls, until these things got so cheap that they weren't worth metering, all were in that category.<p>Personally, I suspect there's some behavioral economics ish at work here that is measurable, like...you know how some hotels and cruiseships have all-in prices?  I bet people are actually willing to pay more for the same amount of consumption with the 'unlimited' plans because they enjoy not having to worry about it.  This would also be pretty easy to test with cruiseship or all-inclusive resort data where they also sell other a la carte packages.<p>I have data cap plans on my phone and iPad, and I don't really mind them, but its only because I know that they are effectively unlimited: I never come close to using up the cap level of data.  I don't watch Slingbox on my phone, etc.<p>I tell you what really burns me up though: the fact that even though I am paying per-gigabyte transfer fees on my iDevices, AT&T wants me to pay <i>more</i> money to tether to my laptop.  Why the fuck should they care?  The data is the data.  I understood when the idae was that a tethered laptop would use assloads of data on the nominal ""unlimited"" plan exceeding their modelled costs, but...dude, I bought data transfer.  why do you give a shit which device the packets end up on?

One optimizes for average karma by not commenting on stories that are older or less popular, as those are likely to produce a 1 or 2 rating due to lack of eyeballs. However such comments are often interesting and useful contributions, and it hurts HN to discourage them.<p>A possible solution is to scale by the number of people who look at the comment, although this might be difficult to do well. You could probably get better results by estimating a regression containing the following variables: age of post, score of post, number of comments, average score of comments in the thread, and the depth of the tree in which the comment was posted to get a good determination of how many points an average comment in that situation would get.",1314151498

It's much easier to do in a language that allows for easy creation of closures. Such a system wouldn't be impossible to construct in C++; you could create an ErrorHandlers object that is passed as the last argument of every method and contains instances of some kind of ""RestartCase"" object. But I cringe at the amount of boilerplate that would be required to support such an approach.",1279058394

That is, objects that <i>already existed</i> are linked together through fields inside the object themselves. Since you're probably already operating on the object, it's not quite as bad for cache performance as the container style lists. Further, since the objects already exist, the memory allocation overhead is minimal. All objects of that type need an extra pointer, but there's no allocation required to add something to the list.<p>This is how the Linux kernel maintains just about everything. It's also how I've implemented lists <i>inside</i> of an allocator: <a href=""http://github.com/scotts/streamflow/blob/master/streamflow.h#L225"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/scotts/streamflow/blob/master/streamflow.h...</a>",1279058241

1512862,comment,1511990,1512466,0,0,Xurinos,,,"No?<p>My EE classes were about logic gates, flip-flops, and other abstractions.  Logic gate chips are abstractions on some complex stuff that you do NOT have to worry about in CS (the real stuff -- resistance, etc).<p>EE, as served to CS folks, is another approach towards understanding &&, ||, ^, and so forth.  You get a firmer grasp on the relationships between logical things.  For example, it should be trivial for you to see that !(a && b) == (!a || !b), and you can transform your complex conditional statement to whatever is most readable.<p>For that matter, should you have to work with assembly, what you learn of these logical abstractions will help with optimization.<p>Another point... Especially in introductory CS courses and in most algorithms courses, we focus primarily on sequential approaches towards problem solving.  In EE, things are, by default, parallel.  They have to force sequence (where necessary) with such mechanisms as flip-flops.  Exposure to thinking the EE way actually helps with abstract problem solving in parallel software development.  For example, software ""pipelines"" are modeled much after the hardware circuit pipelines.  OpenGL?  Functional programming?  Many similarities.<p>I remember very specifically coming up with a good heuristic towards solving the big P/NP problem that came from a realization I made from playing with the EE logic stuff.<p>What about synchronization?  Locks?  You have handy API for this stuff, but, as evidenced by a lot of bad programming and fear of parallel programming in the last 20 years, people do not actually know how to use these tools, much less how they work.  And the EE guys work with this kind of thing regularly; they already have a number of answers that we can use to model our software.<p>Finally, if you ever have to develop software that helps in the operation of circuit boards, dealing with FPGAs or microprocessors, the EE knowledge helps you and them debug interaction problems (the most common problem being that of timing and how to synchronize all those parallel events).  I know... been there... was thankful for the background and was able to help dig into FPGA code to find the subtle problems quicker.<p>Just to toss in the authority argument, isn't Sussman an EE guy?<p>So yes, a certain exposure to EE is valuable for students of CS, primarily for the exposure to other ways to approach everyday CS problems.",1279057257

I think that's the real gotcha of programming.  The programming languages today probably are better described as ""good generalizations"" of the operations available on a CPU, and the abstraction leaks quite a bit when doing certain things like needing to deal with synchronization.  If our programming languages were designed to be perfect abstractions, there'd probably be a subset of the english languages that could described/translate everything to machine code, but that's definitely not the case reality today.

'Design' too, is nothing more than creative problem-solving.  
Anyone is engaged in the act of 'designing' as much in figuring out the best way to tie shoelaces in record time - as figuring out user interaction in a computational setting.

What you get is an overabundant chunk of information that contains more of the ritual language-specific circlejerk, than the info you're actually looking for.<p>This situation is all over the undergrad academia. For a math major, numerical method algorithms described in advanced notation is ok, as long as you are fluent in it. But when I take CS courses and see the same presentation, I get very confused. For god's sake, these people are going to spend more time on Novell manuals, than on the graph theory. I could have learnt all these algorithms, if I didn't need to chew through all that theoretical packaging and generalization. Instead I spend all my time to dig through precise definitions just to get one or two concepts, when I could have gotten them all, if representation was good enough.<p>I don't think that CS undergrads don't need precision offered by scientific approach. I think there comes a time when you feel the need for precision. But this time won't come when you only know quicksort in java. You have to gain a broad specter of examples before you can set off to learn about big O analysis. Because this kind of analysis is about comparison. Learning is ineffective when you compare one algorithm with a blurred idea of another.<p>I might sound like a confused student, but what I'm trying to say is that there should be one unified, simple and consistent source of algorithms in understandable languages. I have the large algorithm encyclopedia from Springer Verlag, and it polluted with all uncertainties of the modern CS studies. It shows us the perspective fields of study, but it's too abundant to explain simple ideas. Same thing is about Wikipedia.

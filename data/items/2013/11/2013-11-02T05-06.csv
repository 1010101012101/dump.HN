6658328,comment,6657072,6658185,1,0,throwawaykf,,,"<i>> Where did I say that? </i><p>Hmm, I read that as a precursor to your later arguments.<p><i>> &quot;We did not enter the search business, Jobs said. They entered the phone business. ... This dont be evil mantra: Its bullshit.</i><p>Ahh, OK, a bit indirect, but I can see where you&#x27;re coming from.<p><i>> The rest of your post comes down to a disagreement on basic principles for which we will never agree.</i><p>But that&#x27;s exactly my point! You and many people here pass judgement on things based on their own principles as if those were a given! I try to present an alternate perspective because it&#x27;s hard to come by around here.<p>Now, even if asserting opinions as fact is taken as a reality of forum life and overlooked, there&#x27;s another thing irks me: when it comes to patents, those opinions are almost always poorly informed, and my agenda really is to spread more awareness. This is also why I try to support my points with studies instead of regurgitating talking points put out by tech media outlets.<p><i>> I have opposed software patents for decades, far longer than I&#x27;ve been a Google employee (indeed, I was attracted to Google because of its stance on software freedom)</i><p>Yes, Google certainly is one of the stronger proponents of free software. But you should ask how much of that is because it conveniently aligns with their business strategy (see: Spolsky&#x27;s &quot;commoditize your complements.&quot;) And again, it would be useful to keep Google&#x27;s antics with Motorola in mind. I do not say this to disenfranchise you with Google -- it is indeed an excellent company to work for -- but more from the perspective that an employers&#x27; stance on IP should not affect an employee&#x27;s opinions. The employer is acting in their own best interests. So should the employee.<p><i>> possibly even a lawyer or an employee of IP vultures.</i><p>Heh, no, just a geek with a very strong interest in IP. I did previously work with a very IP-focused company, which is where I picked up my patent background, but this was the proverbial little guy that had been ripped off by the big guys, almost went under, and only managed to prevail through patents. Thus I have a very different view point on these things.<p><i>> All the other attempted utilitarian justifications are bullshit. They might hold for pharmaceuticals, or other industries where it may take 10 years to R&D a drug, but the idea that software patents represent extreme risks and expenses in development is ludicrous, and anyone who has written more than a few thousand lines of code knows that.</i><p>Any 12 year old can write a few thousand lines of code. <i>Which</i> thousand lines of code to write to provide the most value is something that only comes with a lot more insight.<p>Ask yourself: how much do software companies invest in R&D? See that war for talent out there? How much does it cost to retain the best talent? How much does the free food and health insurance and perks cost in addition to the 6-figure salaries? What are Google&#x27;s biggest expenses? Would you call that a trivial investment? Now think about what that investment gets you, and whether that&#x27;s something that a company can reasonably want to protect.<p><i>> The VC justification is bullshit too, I founded, raised funding, and sold two startup companies without patents.</i><p>Just because you did it that way doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the best way. I posted studies showing that it&#x27;s easier to get financing if you have patents, <i>and</i> companies with patents are more likely to have successful exits. Sure, your experience is valid, but that does not mean others should deny any advantages they can rightfully take.<p><i>> The concept of predatory pricing makes no sense for something owned by the public (open source).</i><p>Nit-pick, but most open source is not really owned by the public. Especially not Android. Not when it takes an Amazon to fork Android.<p><i>> I would argue that if companies battling it out is creating and giving away knowledge or information to be owned by the public and freely copied, then it is a good for society and is exactly the kind of thing we want to be encouraging.</i><p>Couple of things:<p>1) If it&#x27;s knowledge you created all by yourself, you can give it away all you want. But if it&#x27;s simply a rehashing of knowledge somebody else created, not so much. This is essentially the purpose of IP, which you&#x27;re free to disagree with, but society in general has decided to support it.<p>2) If giving away knowledge was such a great thing, why doesn&#x27;t Google open source <i>all</i> it&#x27;s IP? Think about where you draw the lines.<p><i>> Your vested interest is in protecting corporate interests against the public it seems.</i><p>Oh no, very much no. I don&#x27;t have any vested interests yet, but if I do, they will be very much in <i>my own</i> interest rather than any corporation or any public. That may seem selfish, but I have seen with my own eyes time and again how the public and corporations will take what they can get and give back nothing if they can get away with it.",1383371955

It&#x27;s usually at the top that people bring their own team in.<p>With the second position and the USB wireless incident, I would say that you need to look at what led to the firing. I find it very hard to believe that a company would just fire someone without their already being an agenda for it. Did you do this before? Did you try to circumvent security before this in other ways? Were you getting along with the team? Were there issues of fit? Did you feel you were being productive? All these questions exist and should be answered.<p>It&#x27;s very likely that you were on the chopping block and the company was waiting to get you out the door. It may have worked very nicely for them that you give them a nice easy rational for firing you without having them to pull the trigger.<p>It&#x27;s been my experience that when a company is ready to fire you or lay you off, the time you come in the morning, when you leave, how long your lunch breaks are, etc. all become sticking points.

Vanilla Android and timely updates were what Google were pushing for the GNex, but these days it seems to mostly be serving as vague mid-range price pressure? The only real common thread for the phones seem to be that they were primarily Google dev devices.<p>And while it might have been an implicit promise, sadly, I don&#x27;t think long-term support (or any customer support, really) was ever much in the cards.<p>FWIW my Google devices (from G1 on) have all eventually migrated to CyanogenMod, where they&#x27;ve run better than they ever did on stock.  While CM isn&#x27;t rushing to 4.4 (the plan is to land 10.2/4.3 before starting work on 10.3/4.4), updates have always lasted longer than I&#x27;ve wanted to keep using the devices.

As for &quot;allow a client&quot;, i think you are confused.  Lawyers analyze and assess risk and legal implications. We tell this to the client. The client gets the final say, and makes business decisions.   If you live in a world where you need a lawyer&#x27;s permission to &quot;expose yourself like this&quot;, i suggest you run :)<p>B. Yes.  A lot, at least in the US (other countries, more questionable).  The general principle you are looking for is &quot;legal estoppel&quot;. You don&#x27;t get to promise people they can use something, and then try to stop them legally when they do.
This is true whether it&#x27;s patents or contracts.
 While most deals of the patent cases deal with sales, the case law is fairly clear on this exact point (IE that unless you explicitly disclaim an implied license, you won&#x27;t get to give something to someone to use and then claim using it violates your patents).  It just would be legal estoppel for a different reason other than sale.",1383371243

6658300,comment,6657621,6658268,2,0,ktsmith,,,"> Common core curriculum (in CA, not NY, but they seem to be similar), but not Pearson tests.<p>Yeah, the whole point is that if both states are implementing common core they should be the same. If you look at the NY Common Core standard it&#x27;s a word for word match with what is posted on achievethecore.org and commoncore.org. Where the differences lie is in the curriculums that each state, and even each school district within a state, choose to buy and then how the schools implement it. I&#x27;m seeing some schools being extremely strict and enforcing scripted curriculum on teachers such as that provided by Success for All and other schools allowing teachers leeway to teach how they feel is best for their class each year so long as it&#x27;s consistent across the grade level (all teachers teaching the same concepts at the same times).<p>> I do have a problem with the attention her district pays to testing, but not really with the curriculum per se.<p>Has California, or specifically your school district, implemented performance based pay or bonuses? That&#x27;s in a trial run here and there have already been complaints about increases in test focus at the schools in the trial. A big part of the performance evaluation is based on test scores.<p>edit: I should note that there&#x27;s the common core standards and then common core curriculums. The curriculums should be compliant with the standards but aren&#x27;t the same thing. So NY and CA should both be adhering to the same standard while they are free to use different curriculum (and almost certainly do from district to district).",1383370998

This is covered in the dev policy, and has been for a long time.  Their are non-assertions/grants on file for a number of companies now.<p>As for whether Apple owns any patents on LLVM core, Chris Lattner himself told me Apple held none, which is why they had not filed a non-assertion.<p>Apple may or may not hold patents on LLVM code that is not &quot;in tree&quot; (so yes, they may have non-public frontends or backends they own patents on), and I never specifically asked about the clang frontend, but I trust Chris enough to know that if there was in-project code, be it clang or core or whatever, he would have followed the dev policy and Apple would have non-asserted them.",1383370211

I don&#x27;t plan on making money from it right away. I would love to, but at the end of the day.. It comes down to what is reality, which in this case for me is that I will not be making any/much money off of my site. I&#x27;ve looked at alternatives to how I can change this and will continue to do so. Kudos to you for managing to keep your idea going for this long with little to no hope. Maybe I will have to be just like you and just keep at it only because of the love and passion you have for your own product. Best of luck to you on your new project(s)",1383368474

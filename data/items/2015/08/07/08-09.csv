Protectionism has historically worked exceptionally well to develop your own industry, as a matter of fact, all the big players heavily used protectionism in their time to nurture their industry before being big (England, USA, China, South Korea). You just cannot compete with an on-going industry while starting from scratch, so your industry will never take off.<p>Protectionism is only good if you&#x27;re already the best in town & want to be sure that you keep the upper hand, but it helps in no way the under-developed country.",1438937923

For continuous data, you can often do better even with a simple Gaussian mixture model. Other than that they are cumbersome to train (the gradient needs to be approximated), and the for continuous variants training can be unstable unless you use very low learning rates.<p>They were very popular for unsupervised pre-training a while ago, but the utility of pre-training has greatly diminished. Unless you have a ton of unlabeled data and very few labels, it&#x27;s not worth the effort. And if it is, you are better off using autoencoders for pre-training anyway. They are conceptually much simpler and easier to understand, and you&#x27;ll get roughly the same results.<p>If you want to get started with deep learning, focus on feed-forward and recurrent neural nets instead, you&#x27;ll get much more useful knowledge out of that. For most of the common deep learning use cases there is no need to bother with RBMs anymore.",1438937908

They are acting intentionally and rationally.  But their monopoly is hurting others, so we (er, the EU) convict(s) Google of malice.<p>However, another plausible position is that Google is merely behaving <i>negligently</i>.  There are some studies (paid by competitors, sure) showing users <i>dislike</i> Google promoted content and products.  Those products should probably have their A/B tests ended, but nobody has the guts to pull the plug (and willpower to evolve the effort into something else).  Knowledge Base has sucked away ~30% of Wikipedia&#x27;s traffic, which thankfully has not <i>yet</i> hurt donations.  Google certainly doesn&#x27;t want Wikipedia to fall apart.<p>If we want to draw a parallel to Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly, we could point out how IE was initially a good product but then fell behind the competition.  Pushing it on consumers not only hurt consumer choice, but (over time) locked users into a poor experience.

Are you typically eating much of this?<p>For interest and discussion I&#x27;ll paste in my notes on Fenugreek:<p>________________________<p>Fenugreek - scientific name Trigonellafoenum-graecum - Year 2 Term 1 Week 1 Cardiovascular System Continued<p>Fenugreek has a very broad and often under appreciated action including mucus dissolver, digestive tonic, nutritive in convalescence, lowering of blood glucose levels, galactogogue, anti-inflammatory, lymphatic decongestant and liver tonic. The liver tonic action is specifically helpful in improving liver fat metabolism and via this action Fenugreek assists in the lowering of cholesterol levels.<p>The colour of Fenugreek extract is similar to bile (doctrine of signatures) and although Fenugreek is only a very mild cholagogue it is well indicated in the patient with bile deficiency and raised blood cholesterol because it improves the liver&#x27;s fat metabolism. A subset of patients with raised blood cholesterol have the problem due mainly to blood sugar disorders (typically hyperinsulinaemia for many years followed by exhaustion of the pancreas and relative insulin lack and or the development of insulin resistance. When the pancreas is exhausted and fails to secrete sufficient insulin levels to meet the bodies needs or when insulin resistance begins the patient has type 2 diabetes.) In all these stages of blood sugar dysregulation Fenugreek is well indicated to assist in controlling high blood glucose levels and to act as a liver tonic and cholesterol lowering agent. About 50% of all patients with raised blood cholesterol will have blood sugar dysregulation as part of the aetiology. The lymphatic system is also involved in fat metabolism and Fenugreek will improve the lymphatic involvement in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Summary - Fenugreek is mainly indicated in raised blood cholesterol with bile deficient liver disorder, blood sugar regulation disorder or lymphatic circulatory congestion. The liver and lymphatic aspects are well illustrated in the iris analysis of high cholesterol patients with the characteristic yellow deposits over liver, gall bladder, lymphatic rosary and lymphatic overlay. Light coloured stools, digestive intolerance to fatty foods and erratic blood glucose levels are also indicators for Fenugreek in raised blood cholesterol. Fenugreek also has an empirical use to improve overall lipid metabolism and to act as a blood vessel detoxifier which will assist in the dissolving of atheroma deposits in the artery walls. This action is indicated in coronary artery atherosclerosis and in carotid artery atherosclerosis which has a propensity to lead to stroke when deposits dislodge from the carotid atheroma and are transported to the brain. The majority of these patients are current or past cigarette smokers who would not have developed the carotid artery disease if they has not smoked. Fenugreek tea (short decoction) is mildly active in improving liver, cholesterol, atheroma etc but the main preparation needed in these conditions is an extract 1: 1 or 1:2 taken over many months and years. The most commonly used CV combinations utilising Fenugreek are; raised blood cholesterol with liver dysfunction and bile deficiency - Fenugreek with Fringe Tree, Dandelion Root, Globe Artichoke, St Mary&#x27;s Thistle (and usually Guggal Guggal / Garlic capsules) ; raised blood cholesterol with blood sugar disorder / elevated blood glucose Fenugreek with Goats Rue, Gymnea, Fringe Tree (and usually Guggal Guggal / Garlic capsules) ; raised blood cholesterol with marked lymphatic congestion Fenugreek \nwith Echinacea angustifolia, Clivers (and usually Guggal Guggal / Garlic capsules). Refer to Year 1 Term 2 Week 1 Hepatics for more information of Fenugreek.<p>________________________<p>My notes go on further but comment length here is restrictive.<p>Definitely interested in what the HN community has to say about this sort of information.",1438935544

Last system i saw, which was pretty old, had at least half a dozen from what i could tell from my end of the system, probably even more internally inside or behind other components. Modern cars also use flexray, LIN, MOST and all other kinds of buses. The reason for this is safety, bandwidth and that the delay jitter on a highly loaded can bus can be relatively unpredictable for high frequency control requirements like suspension, traction and other engine related control.",1438934645

It's even worse.<p>The hack the creators of SC4 used to get around the problem of traveling the same path twice in one trip is responsible for a large waste of CPU cycles. Essentially, the hack allows the Sim to ""forget"" how he got to a certain location and start a new trip to the final destination. The downside is that this is that all of the information from the previous leg of the trip is lost, and the algorithm must run again. There isn't a 1:1 ratio between the amount of citizens and CPU cycles wasted, because as your city grows the path each citizen must take becomes more complex and consumes more cycles.<p>You can read more about it <i>here</i>, at a third party fan site.

5247314,comment,5246003,5246276,17,0,KMag,,,"Incorrect.  Even malware targeting write-once-run-anywhere systems is rarely write-once-run-anywhere itself.  The actual shellcode of the exploit is almost always native code, or a native binary dropped on the filesystem via a directory traversal bug.  The attacker typically has to determine the system being attacked and use system-specific shellcode, even for system-independent vulnerabilities.  The JIT or bytecode interpreter is rarely directly leveraged by the exploit code itself.  In other words, the shellcode is almost never bytecode.<p>Write once run anywhere isn't the problem.  Write once run anywhere is just a feature that greatly increases the number of machines with a given piece of vulnerable software installed.  VMs also tend to be big complicated pieces of software with a huge attack surface, and tend to be written in unsafe languages (C/C++).<p>If 99% of all browsers used very similar versions of libpng, all with the same vulnerability, we'd see this same problem.<p>Software monoculture combined with poor incentives to write secure software is the problem.<p>Edit: since write-once-run-anywhere languages tend to be more safe, it's a shame that more VMs aren't written in (subsets of) their hosted languages.

(It's also odd to cite the MOOC rate and then instantly change tact mid-article to analyze instead paid classes with an online component that are offered by colleges: it likely gives readers the idea that the paid classes for credit offered to enrolled college students also have a 90% attrition, which is not established.)<p>Significant numbers of people who enroll in MOOCs do not intend to complete every class they enroll in. And that is perfectly fine. There are various reasons. Some are curious about the material. Some are only interested in watching some of the lectures. Some are teachers checking out the MOOC scene but not wanting to spend the time to do assignments. Some are 10 year olds doing it on a lark. Some are people who realize they don't have all the requirements after trying a few problem sets. Some sign up weeks in advance but by the time the class starts they have forgotten about the class, become too busy, or lost interest. Even among the serious students many will sign up for 10 classes at a time, then end up sticking with the ones they find the most fun or interesting. None of these cases are where the class has failed.<p>The real numbers to look at are the number of people who successfully complete the programs. These numbers are astounding and encouraging. Often 6000 students each time will pass with flying colors. There are no tuition based programs that come any where near that level of amazing success. In many cases the classes have provided to thousands of people throughout the world, at nominal cost, Ivy League quality classes from colleges such as Princeton, Stanford, Harvard, MIT and Yale. Most of these are people who would never be able to attend these universities or have access to this teaching.<p>As far as the unmotivated students, they also fail at a high rate in brick and mortar classes as well. Excepting the top colleges that pre-filter out unmotivated applicants, college attrition for freshmen is very high nationally. 37 million americans have started college but left without completing a degree. Nationally half of people starting college drop out. This is for people who are at least motivated enough to be willing to pay for the experience and arrange their lives so they can physically attend classes in person.<p>What percentage of MOOC enrollees that start with the needed prerequisites and have a serious intention and time to complete the class completes it?

Those who can afford to pay, are on a health plan - the bulk of those who aren't on a plan are financially compromised and likely to default on their debts. This encourages a wild inflation of quoted cost to compensate.<p>- This further drives people to health plans. Barring the ultra-rich, no one is able to afford health care at ""free market"" prices, making health plans the only reasonable route forward.<p>In short, what's wrong with people paying out of pocket for basic services is that ""basic services"" at market rates will set you back $300 for sore throat.",1361310000

Nesting elements is dead simple in HAML:<p><pre><code>  %ul\n    %li\n</code></pre>\nyields<p><pre><code>  <ul>\n    <li></li>\n  </ul>\n</code></pre>\n> some syntax has been introduced to discourage it (the end of line pipe),<p>The end of line pipe is for when you have very code that goes with a single element. From the docs:<p><pre><code>  %p= @this.is(way.too.much). |\n      code(""and I should"").   |\n      really_move.it.into(    |\n        :a => @helper)        |\n</code></pre>\nUsually, though, this should go into a helper, because your templates shouldn't have that much logic in them.<p>> or you're told to just... use plain HTML.<p>This makes me think you don't know what you're talking about. Again, it's easy to nest elements in HAML. You wouldn't drop to HTML just because you want to nest elements.<p>> Want to interpolate variables? That's probably built in, which is great until you try changing it back to plain HTML, and then have to scan for all the interpolation, which is now plain text.<p>Of course it's ""probably built in,"" interpolation is core to any templating engine. Interpolation is dead simple, as well.<p><pre><code>  %ul= some_variable\n</code></pre>\nI'm not sure what you mean by ""turn it back to plain HTML."" At what point can you turn any template language back to plain HTML without having the interpolation be a problem?<p>> There's likely so much focus placed on ""one-lining"" everything that you have to do silly things just to actually make the template readable, when it wouldn't be a problem in HTML.<p>Do you have any examples of this? In my experience, whitespace-significant template languages do more to discourage one-line operations. Instead of doing this:<p><pre><code>  <ul><li></li></ul>\n</code></pre>\nyou're forced to break it up into multiple lines:<p><pre><code>  %ul\n    %li\n</code></pre>\n> Never mind the total lack of portability and, especially these days, requiring a copy of Node just to run the damn things. Which is fine until you realise you shouldn't need to add a full on javascript VM to your development dependencies.<p>I've never used a template language that didn't require some programming language to evaluate. Usually they require the language that the entire project is being built with; e.g., HAML assumes you are writing a Ruby project.<p>There are a lot of framework tools that require some sort of precompilation, too. If you're building anything reasonably complex, you're probably going to want to be able to split your files out into smaller chunks, which means using something like Less/SASS for CSS and require.js for dependency management. All of those have external dependencies. Or do you really not care to compile your disparate JS and CSS files into a single download?<p>> That so many of these attempts at 'HTML templating languages' exist is probably testament to the fact that no one agrees on what one should look like.<p>Isn't that a great thing, though? Diversity in this means the technology hasn't stagnated.<p>> They've actually been staring it in the face all along: plain old HTML.<p>I have no idea what you are suggesting with this point. What does HTML actually offer as a templating language? There's no built-in variable interpolation, no built-in template segmenting (e.g., rendering a partial), and no built-in control structures (loops, conditionals, functions, etc.). Once you've added all that in, you either have another template engine that requires something like node.js to precompile for performance reasons, or you have a mess of spaghetti that only the creator knows how to maintain.",1361309997

For one thing, there are alternatives to Ubuntu on the desktop. For new users who are not completely helpless with computers Linux Mint LTS with MATE is likely a better choice than Ubuntu. MATE is very Windows-like; there's a lot that can be configured through the GUI in that DE and, FWIW, I have had a good amount of success converting Windows users to it.<p>As for those who are ""so inept [they] only use a browser"", well, not all of such users can afford an iPad, especially not in those parts of the world where they have both significantly higher prices on iPads and a lower average income than the US (e.g., Eastern Europe), and even Ubuntu with Unity delivers great value to them.

Think Google Analytics for Facebook Pages, Apps, etc.<p>One of the things I built that term was a tool to visualize user retention, implementing triangle heatmaps, which I believe were invented in-house by Danny Ferante.<p>The idea here is to exploit the very quick visual pattern matching we're able to do as humans, and turn that into actionable cohort analysis. From the screenshot in the article (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/qBbkZv8.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/qBbkZv8.png</a>), I think we can agree that it would become unwieldy with a large number of datapoints.<p>Compare this to <a href=""http://imgur.com/sOQ4vrm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/sOQ4vrm</a>, a screenshot of the triangle heatmap generated for tcreech's Cover Photo Finder Facebook App. The x-axis represents the cohort (the set of users that installed the app on the same day) broken down by day instead of by week like the article (hence patterns are more granular). The y-axis represents number of days after installation. Each datapoint is then coloured to represent the percentage of users that return to the app on (installation date + number of days).<p>A number of patterns are captured quite easily:<p>- A vertical pattern is local to a specific cohort. A new promotion or redesigned sign up page often results in this.<p>- A horizontal pattern is local to a specific vintage. If your app has a trial period that expires after 7 days, then you'll see your retention plummet across all cohorts horizontally at y=7.<p>- A diagonal pattern is local to a specific date. If your app is down on January 2nd, then there will be a diagonal blue line (0%) across all cohorts.<p>I wrote up a work term report for the University of Waterloo detailing triangle heatmaps: <a href=""http://zeroindexed.com/triangle.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zeroindexed.com/triangle.pdf</a><p>Video released by Facebook explaining triangle heatmaps: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=3707283286197"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=3707283286197</a>",1361308881

I've written a fair whack of plain HTML, whilst having used some preprocessors before, so I have some thoughts.<p>Writing plain HTML purely by hand is a pain. A massive pain. Don't do it. If you're writing HTML by hand, you're writing well over half of what you should be writing. There are tools out there that help, my number one favourite being ZEN coding.<p>ZEN coding is a set of tools, namely an abbreviation engine, for writing and manipulating HTML. The abbreviation engine allows you to write CSS selectors in place that ZEN will expand for you, which alone is extremely powerful. For example, the if we want 2 unordered lists of 4 links, we can write:<p><pre><code>  ul*2>li*4>a\n</code></pre>\nThis would be expanded to:<p><pre><code>  <ul>\n    <li><a href=""""></a></li>\n    <li><a href=""""></a></li>\n    <li><a href=""""></a></li>\n    <li><a href=""""></a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=""""></a></li>\n    <li><a href=""""></a></li>\n    <li><a href=""""></a></li>\n    <li><a href=""""></a></li>\n  </ul>\n</code></pre>\nZEN further provides hotkeys for navigating the blank spaces in this generated code where I'd likely want to fill something in.<p>This is just the start though, it really comes into its own when you realise the power of Wrap abbreviation.<p>ZEN coding dramatically increases the rate I can write HTML and it did this within a couple of days. I remember when me and a colleague would receive a Word doc which had to be completely marked up. My colleague would take it up using a hacked together solution - he wasn't a very good programmer but had more HTML/CSS experience than me. This would take him around 2 hours to complete (70+ page doc). When he left, it was down to me. I completed it in the same amount of time using just ZEN coding (I'm not crazy though, I did write a better tool which cut that job down to 5 mins).<p>I advocate it so much I demand any new starter to learn it as a priority - the difference in productivity is phenomenal.<p>With ZEN coding, I don't need these abstractions. I can just write HTML and I don't need to recompile every time I update it.<p>I urge you all to try it. It will change your perception of writing HTML. Funnily enough, I now find it therapeutic.",1361308624

If the doctor wasn't there, chances are it wouldn't have been picked up on. Even had he been rushed to hospital, his chance of survival would have been pretty low - heart attacks are still a major killer in the 2010s where even in London, which has the highest survival rate in the UK for heart attacks that occur outside a hospital, the survival rate is only 30%. Keep in mind though that survival rates have increased significantly over the last fourty years with advances in diagnostics and treatment as well as improved defibrillators etc.<p>Your grandmother's case is a more clear cut case of failure. Waiting times have long been a problem in the NHS, but it's a matter of resource contention, and it's a problem which they're trying to improve with the guarantee that patients should start treatment within 18 weeks of their first appointment and that tests should be done within six weeks. The only, very rough, numbers I can find for the US suggests that scans and tests are normally done within seven to twenty weeks when cancer is suspected. Even in the US, the problem of resources exists - there's only so many hospitals that can perform certain types of scans, and only so many doctors who are capable of properly interpreting the results. The thing I can't comment on is whether or not the physician who saw your grandmother should have treated it as a higher priority or if, given the symptoms that were presented, it would be reasonable to assume that there was a benign cause and it being cancer was pretty remote possibility. If it's the case that his prognosis was obviously wrong given the symptoms, then there's a case to be made for malpractice, or at least a complaint to the GMC and/or NHS trust.",1361308293

They are recorded, but students are expected to attend the live lectures, which involves signing into a chat server much like IRC.  Relying on the recorded lecture archives often means missing out on live group activities conducted on the chat server during class.<p>It was an excellent program, superior to my on-campus undergraduate engineering school experience in some aspects.  In particular, I appreciated how the chat-based lecture attendance allowed students to ask and answer questions without interrupting the professor, which allowed us to learn from each other.  In cases where students might not have an answer, the chat transcript allowed the professor to answer questions during breaks.  There were also a set of web-based forums for each course, where students could hold discussions and ask questions between lectures.<p>The only downside is that the live online lecture model has sort of ruined me for the recorded video model of online education.  I keep signing up for Coursera classes and then not having the motivation to watch the lectures.",1361307705

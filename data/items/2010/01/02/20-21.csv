1027645,comment,1026615,1026888,0,0,silencio,,,"I feel somewhat obligated to reply because I originally tweeted this (and with a title similar to the above).<p>I didn't do this to kick the guy while he's down. It's that on Twitter I knew enough people working in various roles in startups and even just most companies that I thought this would be a good warning to all of them of what never to do. You don't <i>ever</i> publicly accuse your competitor of outright ripping off your idea (if that really was the case, take them to court, but it's clearly not appropriate here). You don't publicly attack your co-founder because it didn't work out for whatever reason. You especially don't do either one in an email to a group of pretty tech-savvy and possibly well-connected people and then go on to attack said group when they don't respond favorably because oh noes, they're being unfair to you. All because you wanted to tell them about your new startup.<p>Pratt seems to want to get more connections and more interested eyes looking at his new project for funding and development and more, and he's not helping his case by acting the way he does. All this bad press could have been prevented if he had edited out most of his original email. It should have been something like ""Hey, remember me, we might have met before at a previous BarCampLA...I was one of the guys behind Fundable. I'm now working on a new startup called PDXCell, and I'd appreciate it if you'd check it out!"". Not this burning-all-bridges tactic. I tend not to talk much at BarCampLA events, but I've still met people there looking to fund startups, talented developers/engineers/hackers, marketing types, and more. That's a lot of potentially useful connections that will now remember this guy as someone never to work with.<p>So while some of the comments here might really be kicking the guy while he is down, I saw this link as an educational moment, especially to HNers that might someday (if not already) find themselves tempted to do the same. I'd hope Pratt realizes what he's doing wrong eventually..",1262465800

Frustrated by the absence of evidence provided by charities that they are delivering the goods in terms of their charitable ends, the pair decided to use their data-analysis skills to evaluate charities' effectiveness. They were appalled at what they found. Evidence-based charity lags far behind evidence-based medicine: virtually no charities do randomised, controlled trials regarding which interventions work. In fact, almost no charities collect any systematic data on whether or not their well-intentioned activities are actually doing any good.\n""""""",1262465626

Finally the developers have it easy"" but when I got to the slider and date section, I suddenly realized how backwards the web-standards really are in comparison to developing desktop-apps. Everything from Visual Studio and Office to wxWidgets has had these tools in their toolboxes for years. I've used the comctl32 date picker for a decade now. I placed a slider control on a VB3.0 form in 1997. Thirteen years later the web still doesn't have either and every single travel website has to implement it on their own (badly).<p>Instead of feeling excited over the new features of HTML5, I feel kinda sad that there still isn't a way to create live datalinks, sortable/filterable tables, listviews, tree-views, and real comboboxes (editable text + listbox) on the web without having to hack something up. Google made a great push towards replacing desktop-apps by creating a really fast browser but that doesn't make it any easier for web developers to create apps that work as well as desktop-apps. I once spent a week writing my own scrollbar and even as I wrote it, I knew I was wasting resources. However, it was a necessary feature for the project and if HTML scrollbars triggered the different events like those in almost any desktop platform, I wouldn't have had to write one from scratch.<p>I think it's great that the iPhone/Safari shows the most appropriate keyboard but compare the controls that iPhone SDK app developers can use vs. those that the iPhone web-app developers can call and you will see why HTML still has a very long way to go. And honestly, I don't see why a damn combobox has taken so long when almost every single web-app has a need for it ( <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1278431/why-does-html-5-not-have-editable-combobox-or-local-menus-built-in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1278431/why-does-html-5-n...</a> ).",1262465200

1027574,comment,1026983,1026983,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"I have one company that uses Google Voice and one that uses Grasshopper. Grasshopper allows you to easily set up a local number and/or an 800 number (you can also import your own number, for instance you GV number). It allows you to setup ""lines"" (press 1 for support, 2 for sales, etc), which can forward to other numbers, record messages, have on-hold music and a hunt group, etc.<p>So, to really answer your qustion, I think it depends on what your startup is. If it's a B2C company that really only needs its own number for support issues and whatnot, you're probably good with just a GV account that forwards to your cell phone. If it is a B2B company though that needs to sound established and professional, I'd consider setting up an 800 number with a multiple-line answering service like Grasshopper, even if every line only forwards to your cell phone for now. This also makes it very easy to scale once you start hiring people.",1262462555

Yes, brackup appears to do snapshotted backups.  No, tarsnap is not brackup.  Yes, there are some similarities in the implementations.  Yes, I believe that tarsnap is superior to brackup; there are several reasons for this, including being better at recognizing unmodified data within modified files.  There are also several other points where I believe that tarsnap is likely to be superior to brackup, but I haven't read enough of the brackup code to be certain exactly how brackup does everything.<p>If that doesn't answer your question... could you elaborate a little bit about what you'd like to know?  (Maybe two words instead of one...)",1210152623

The more passive 'casual users' would use your service for free and communicate very little with you, if at all, about your business.",1210151735

As is learning anything that forces a different way of doing things.<p>Interesting that the article mentions changing ""which thumb is up."" When I was a kid a decided to switch from right thumb up to left, and now it's the only way I do it, and the opposite feels awkward. So on many lateral dominance tests I show up as left-handed, but I'm fully right-handed.<p>I also never knew ""kaizen"" was so much of a technique than a word that just means ""improve for the better,"" nor do I recall it being used specifically as a name of a technique. Not so sure if the article really had to introduce a foreign language to seem more mystical: this is age old wisdom.",1210151220

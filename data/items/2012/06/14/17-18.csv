4112653,comment,4111817,4112128,2,0,Domenic_S,,,"There is a whole spectrum of profitability between not profitable--ramen profitable--yacht profitable. IMO, a startup worth funding needs the money in order to scale, because what they're doing is working and they need to grow it. If you need <i>operating</i> cash, the cheapest you'll get is a bank loan (if you can get there) or even cash advances on credit cards.<p>Some businesses won't scale or won't scale well, which can be a perfectly fine situation as a 2-5 person startup. If I had a 2-person startup bringing in $500k in profit/year I'd be a happy camper, even if it couldn't scale further than that.<p>I think a lot of founders see investor acceptance as a certain validation to their business, when really it is a classification of their business. Investability isn't perfectly correlated with viability. Consultancies might be the perfect example of this -- they can generate major major cashflow, but you'd never want to be an <i>investor</i> in one. Doesn't mean consultancies are bad businesses, and YC's rejection doesn't mean yours is bad business either.",1339696770

4112634,comment,4111817,4111817,2,0,tylermenezes,,,"As someone who's both conducted interviews for an incubator, and been through the YC interviews, I think you're focusing on the wrong thing here. ""The team"" goes a lot beyond paper qualifications, and I think a lot of your shortcomings are there if anywhere:<p>* You changed your answers quickly before your interview because you hadn't thought them through before-hand.\n* You weren't confident.\n* You weren't committed. This is the big one for me. If this is a great idea, why is putting your PhD on hold conditional on getting into YC?<p>YC often accepts startups with ideas they don't like. We got a phone call right after walking out the door even though half the partners still weren't convinced of our idea. The important thing isn't having amazing figures at the start, it's being able to think things through. The YC partners can help with tuning to get the most impact.

Even casually you can see the difference<p>What difference are you referring to?  If you're talking about clarity/pixels, the source format is as important as the projection.  Academy and super 35 waste a lot of space on the frame.  Super 35, which was really common for big time movies a few years ago because you could use spherical lenses, actually requires an intermediate step making it anamorphic for projection... which makes it <i>less</i> clear on the print.<p>The only 35mm source format I would argue provides higher resolution on 35mm than a 4K projector is going to be anamorphic (aka Panavision or 'Scope).  It requires no intermediate step before projection.  It looks like Nolan is shooting Dark Knight Rises anamorphic and 70mm for the IMAX stuff.<p>Other than resolution, the blacklevels of film are higher and there's weave on film.  Plus, unless you only go to high end theaters that take projection seriously, your typical projector jockey at the local AMC can barely get the movie in focus.  I once saw Saving Private Ryan projected with <i>no matte</i>.  So every time an effects shot came on, the top and the bottom were cropped.  Non effects shots had full frame.

In that case, its upstream NTP servers will jump and the local ntpd will slew the clock smoothly over the discontinuity, IIRC.<p>OTOH, if your system is aware of the leap second and if you're using the system clock to calculate intervals (i.e. t2 - t1), expect possibly negative or zero intervals over this timeframe. If you're calculating rates over a roughly 1-second interval, divide-by-zero bugs are definitely possible.<p>On a related note, does anyone know what the Oracle and OpenJDK JVMs do with respect to System.currentTimeMillis? They <i>claim</i> it's number of seconds since the epoch, which would imply this timer will not encounter discontinuities. The only ways I can think of to achieve that are by reading the system clock state to look for the leap insert/del/doublecount flag, or read a copy of the leap second table.<p>[edit] You may be asking, ""Why would anyone use a system of time in which two numbers could refer to the same instant, or one in which a given number could refer to <i>no</i> time at all?

Given that it takes plenty of math to translate a number like 1339696998.435347 into a human-readable date, I think our computers should just be keeping TAI to begin with and make the whole process easier on ourselves; but so many systems assume UTC or POSIX time that we're stuck with it.",1339695886

Think of xbox Kinect-type sensors embedded into everything.<p>Writing solid C code for all those systems will be too hard. We also definitely do not want an serendipitously-designed language (Javascript). Yes, that leaves Python Ruby and so on, which brings us full circle. Go will compete with those languages but not in the domains that are evident today. Not in web browser, and not in a new! improved! web server. It seems to me that Go is a forward-looking design, aimed to meet the challenges of the everything-connected world of tomorrow.<p>To make tomorrow happen, we need a better C. Go is that.",1339695395

4112518,comment,4111817,4112358,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"You should ask ""Why?""<p>It sounds from your previous comments that you are a traffic acquisition play for these providers. You do the leg work and bring them customers, and for that they give you a cut of the action.<p>Its not a bad place to be, but it isn't necessarily a 'viable' place to be. For each customer you bring to them, how much do you make initially? Does the customer come back to you or do they start dealing directly with the vendor? Who answers support calls? What happens during an outage, do you get paged or the underlying cloud vendor?<p>If you don't make a whole lot per customer you have to make it up in volume, and you have to be sure that <i>you</i> are not spending more to get to that customer than the customer pays you. If the customer can cut you out of the loop, you have to know when they are likely to do that and why (volume requirements? custom configurations? etc) and generate a way to predict their exit. That will give you insight into their 'lifetime value.' Finally you need to figure out what is the barrier, if any, to someone else being in your space and going after the same customers (is your offering unique? protectable? etc).<p>Once you know those things then you know what sort of revenue you can expect for 1 customers, 10 customers, and 10,000 customes, and what it might cost you to acquire 1, 10 or 10,000 and by subtracting the second number from the first number, you can figure out how much money you have to pay staff and for facilities, and if you subtract off that cost and the number you have left is positive, then that number, as a percentage of the number you started with, can tell you if this business of yours makes any sense at all. Greater than 15% you can live off it, greater than 50% and you'll be able to expand into adjacent markets, greater than 80% and you'll grow like Google or Microsoft in its early days.",1339695338
4112517,comment,4110480,4111642,3,0,comex,,,"> (Remember that the real impetus for adding them to Unix\nwas X11 and its big and badly-factored libraries, which most of us aren't blessed with.)<p>Really?  Today we are very much blessed with quite a few large libraries - not just X but Qt on top of that and KDE on top of that.  WebKit.  ICU.  These come out to dozens of megabytes.  Static linking would add somewhat less by eliminating unused symbols, but you'd still end up with massive bloat for your GUI processes; maybe with today's disk and memory sizes and SSDs that's not the end of the world, but it would be a rather pointless performance drag.  That's not counting the difference between Go and Plan 9: I count 4,000 odd binaries in my PATH; if they each had the 1 MB overhead of hello world in Go, I'd be out 4 GB, more than I pay for the entire set of libraries on my system (with some redundancy).  (And I hope you don't mind waiting for your programs to compile; despite the Go compiler's vaunted speed, it actually takes over 4 times as long to build hello world as clang for the same in C, the vast majority of which is spent in the <i>linker</i>.)<p>Security?  Today's security environment requires frequent patches to library code.  If you have a system to automatically re-link all the programs that link against libraries with security updates, great (make sure you don't miss any, such as manually compiled or copied binaries); otherwise, your system is impossible to keep secure.",1339695337

It really looks like no one with an up-to-date PLT background was consulted in the design. I agree 100% with Andreas Rossberg (who now, somewhat ironically, works at Google):<p><i>It is ironic that their motivation is to tame and restrict the use of exceptions, and then they replace them by something even richer and much less structured.\nI fail to see any pros of this proposal. It seems mostly equivalent to exceptions, i.e., you can easily express raise/try/finally as syntactic sugar, and likely the other way round. But it is (1) much more ad-hoc -- you cannot give a simple reduction semantics for this, (2) much less orthogonal -- tying `defer' in with function definitions, (3) dependent on mutation -- for recovering and returning alternative results, and implicitly in the semantics of `defer'.\nOne consequence is the loss of beta-convertibility, which means that you as a programmer cannot take an arbitrary piece of code and turn it into a function anymore, or vice versa, eliminate a function by inlining its body. Such abstractions/refactorings are impossible in general under this proposal, or at least require transforming the relevant code in potentially non-trivial ways.</i>",1339694721

This is not a complain; I can understand that the interface of a app is limited to the worldview and needs of its creater. So if he uses an image for a button without an alt/title attribute is because his needs and worldview lack the knowledge that those attributes can be useful for people who can't see images.<p>A program can be made decently accessible without much effort, one needs to make sure only couple of things:\n1) That every element is accessible via keyboard, and\n2) every element has a textual information directly/indirectly attached to it stating its purpose.

And we have advisory services for new companies not familiar with the rules of patent litigation, and patent market intelligence for those who want to keep up with what's happening.",1339693513

7971847,comment,7970781,7970781,4,0,jastanton,,,"I have been playing a lot with Polymer over the last 4 months or so. Here are my thoughts:<p>From what I can tell Polymer works closely with the Chrome team and the features that this &quot;framework&quot; offers are really just upcoming tech that is being built into chrome and is being made available by Polymer. Things like web components, html imports, templating etc... are built built into the browser so the longer you use polymer the less of polymer you will use.<p>When I describe polymer to people I say it&#x27;s an opinion layer on top of upcoming tech. And in addition to that everything is polyfilled to some older browsers, but right now is aimed towards the evergreen browsers.<p>When you ask &quot;should I use Polymer&quot;, what I hear is, &quot;should I get a jump start on the upcoming future of the web&quot;? Lets be clear here, Mozilla, IE, Chrome etc... are all merging on these technologies. Object observers, templating, web components etc... are all emerging, Polymer is just one way you can use them now and tie them all together in an opinionated way. If you don&#x27;t like it you don&#x27;t have to use polymer you could just use plain ol JS and achieve the exact same solution, just slightly more verbose and with less support.<p>Now as to wether or not you should use it? Depends who your audience is. If you need a huge wide support from old browsers, probably not. If you&#x27;re doing tooling for your company then yeah I would, it would be great to get used to the way the web is migrating towards. Just keep in mind everything is still solidifying, so there might be some awkward corner cases or something, but honestly it&#x27;s just plain old Javascript soooo it&#x27;s pretty vanilla so you shouldn&#x27;t have too much difficulty if you know JS.<p>Last thing I have to say about Polymer. It&#x27;s going to stretch the way you think of the DOM and JS. The way everything is structured and the way you should be thinking about it is that every DOM node should be considered an instance of a class. The DOM node exposes an API and away you go plugging and playing into the rest of your JS. It&#x27;s really fun once you get used to it. This will really stretch you when they introduce the ajax api as a DOM node. wat. Crazy things are happening, some good, some will need to be changed.<p>Full disclosure I work at Google as a software engineer that specializes in frontend, so I am exposed to this a lot though I do NOT work on the project. That&#x27;s about it :)",1404232777
7971846,comment,7965197,7969475,2,0,ilyagr,,,"There&#x27;s nothing wrong with what you are doing. There is no law that states that all open source libraries in the world should be perfectly documented, and have a set of tutorials that would gently teach anyone as much as he wants about how to use it. Writing documentation and/or tutorials is hard work,  and the larger your target audience is, the harder and more time-consuming it is.<p>I don&#x27;t think your library will be generally useful to a large audience until you or someone else writes better documentation for it. But you don&#x27;t have to target a large audience. It&#x27;s quite likely that when someone else has the same problem, it would be faster for them to reuse your library than to write their own. They might even document the process.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m qualified to give any specific advice, but here&#x27;s some general suggestions which may or may not be to the point. If you are sufficiently motivated, you should decide who your target audience is, and write enough documentation for them. For example, for an advanced audience, it might be useful to say a few words the general design of your library, explain which problems your library does solve and (more importantly) what the limitations of the design are, perhaps outline anything in the design that is strange or unexpected, but useful from your experience. The most important thing for them to know quickly is whether your library can actually solve their problem (which is probably slightly different from the problem you solved), whether it is actually faster to use your library than to roll their own. If they really need to, they&#x27;ll figure out the rest. The end result might be closer in style to a CS paper than a tutorial.<p>Oh, and one thing you really should fix: it is annoying that the haddock documentation is not available on Hackage at the moment, and probably not searchable on Hoogle as well.<p>Again, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with your library, you are doing a good thing open sourcing it, and any time you put in describing it and explaining it to people is valuable. Just keep doing more of what you are already doing.",1404232757

7971833,comment,7971112,7971112,1,0,mjfl,,,"This past year the (now) rising junior class had the highest number of females that we have ever had in the Physics major. We had all of the things mentioned in the article: significant collaboration outside of class, a community of students outside of class who were all friends, and what I thought could have been a &quot;critical&quot; mass of females for them to feel not alone. However the hope for the record number of female physics students deflated with a pffft as I learned that 7/10 of the girls in this class were dropping the major. The majority reason cited: it was too difficult. Perhaps it was, the physics program at my school is known for being rigorous and difficult, however I feel that it is not the right thing to do to fault my department for its difficulty, it is part of our good reputation. In this way, I think it is more important to inspire a passion for physics <i>before</i> coming to college, so comparatively less females drop when the going gets tough.<p>Perhaps it would be a good idea to add a parallel track for the less competitive students, &quot;easier&quot; classes that don&#x27;t go into the same depth with the material. I sort of cringe at that option, but some departments I know have done that, and it has raised female participation. It does raise the question of how far one can get while in such a track. Physics is unique in that there is a relatively defined mountain you need to climb in order to be recognized as &quot;educated in physics&quot; (I&#x27;m thinking the Griffith&#x27;s books, Taylor&#x27;s Classical Mechanics, and the other big ones) and you really need to put in some blood and sweat to get through them. I&#x27;d worry that you could not get through any of them to any significant level if you insisted on ease of learning. Definitely not far enough to go to physics grad school, but perhaps far enough to get a finance job somewhere...<p>Relating this to coding. Perhaps there is too much emphasis on rigor than there needs to be in current curriculum. Not everyone is going to become a computer scientist or chief software architect. Perhaps it would be better to have more project based courses that are open ended in a way for people to just make what they want instead of &quot;rise to a challenge&quot; which admittedly some people just don&#x27;t have the motivation to do.

In large scale problems it does raise its ugly head and these bugs are difficult to catch because the code is mathematically correct. Using double mitigates the problem to an extent (but then floats are faster for SIMD vectorization).<p>Another side note, I have gradually come to realize and appreciate the unique position that Fortran holds.

7971705,comment,7969902,7971120,3,0,simonster,,,"I think you are getting at this above and what I&#x27;ve written below is somewhat redundant with srean&#x27;s followup, but to clarify, <i>writing</i> vectorized code is mostly orthogonal to using SIMD vector instructions to compute the result. A sufficiently smart compiler can turn a loop into SIMD instructions, and these days most compilers (including LLVM, which Julia uses) are pretty good at that.<p>The problem that Julia solves here is that many scientific programming environments <i>require</i> you to write vectorized code, because they are interpreted and so looping through the elements in a vector incurs massive interpreter overhead. In some cases, this can make your code much more difficult to understand than if you wrote an explicit loop, but even when it does not, it often forces you to give up performance that could be obtained if you could write the code in a devectorized manner.<p>For example, consider the problem of calculating the variance of a sample. To calculate the variance in MATLAB, one might write:<p><pre><code>  mu = mean(x)\n  sum((x - mu).^2) / (length(x) - 1)\n</code></pre>\nAlthough I don&#x27;t know the details of how MATLAB optimizes this code, I do know that it has roughly equivalent performance characteristics to Julia code that first computes x - mu, then computes abs2(x - mu), then sums along the result. With an interpreter, you can&#x27;t do much better, and this is actually how the MATLAB var function does it. In Julia, we compute the variance as:<p><pre><code>  mu = mean(x)\n  v = 0.\n  for i = 1:length(x)\n      v += abs2(x[i] - mu)\n  end\n  v / (length(x) - 1)\n</code></pre>\nThis is several times faster than MATLAB&#x27;s included var function, because the computations performed on each element are cheap relative to the cost of memory access. If you wrap the loop in the @simd macro and add @inbounds to eliminate the bounds check when accessing x, the LLVM loop vectorizer will actually take that loop and translate it into SIMD instructions, making it even faster. (The @simd macro is necessary to tell LLVM that it&#x27;s okay to vectorize, since accumulating into n variables and summing them at the end gives different [but usually more accurate] results compared to accumulating into a single variable due to floating point rounding.)<p>The promise of Devectorize.jl is that you will be able to write the first code fragment and have it transformed to the second, which would be neat indeed.",1404231471

One line of code. Building a multisig transaction locally?

7971703,comment,7969666,7970805,1,0,logicallee,,,"This is good, let&#x27;s analyze a bit more.  It sounds like you know what you&#x27;re doing. (I don&#x27;t.)<p>1.  Note you get bitcoins during your manipulation as well - so how much did you overpay for the bitcoins that it took to get you the $67K discount?  I count that you achieved a 1.37% rise in price, so even if you put in your full $800K at the higher price, that cost you $10,960 in overpayment.  There is a direct relationship between the amount of move that you cause, and the amount that you overpay.  So the question is, what that relationship is - we have to compare it with the profits from the NewEgg orders at the manipulated price.<p>1b.  Also note that there is a chance you can sell some of them back at a slightly increased price if NewEgg confirms your order quickly, as you&#x27;ve just filled all the lower-price bids on the exchange you just manipulated.<p>If nobody knows about your manipulation directly, you might even cause a bull run where people think the price is just going to go up and up - you only meant to manipulate it to a brief target price, not caring about the price fall after, but maybe you can sell at a profit as a follow-on effect.<p>2. On the other hand, $67,700 discount on $5M order is nothing – it doesn’t cause the price to fall below wholesale, so there’s no reason to do the manipulation, since NewEgg isn’t offering cash, it’s offering product.  The question then becomes: how much would we have to increase „1a” (the $10K ”fee” you paid for a 1.37% drop) by, to cause an, e.g., 15% drop, 20% drop, 25% drop, 30% drop, 35% drop, 50% drop, 75% drop, 80% drop, 95% drop.  That would be interesting in table form.  The drop would have to be high, as the manipulator would have to get product below wholesale price.<p>3.  $5M is not an upper limit.  In a distributed way, there’s no way many customers couldn’t place $10M in orders together.  However, they would to coordinate and play ball with each other: if any of them knows that manipulation will happen trying to corner a shallow exchange market, they can take the other side of the transaction.  If they know that at a certain time, $15M will be spent on manipulating the spot price for 15 minutes, they can just set aside $15M to place on asks on the other side.  So it’s quite dangerous, especially if the price movement is intended to be high.  The element of surprise would have to be high.<p>This seems mostly a theoretical exercise, as in practice NewEgg could fail to honor prices that are outside the previous day’s intraday, or that sort of thing.<p>Still, I&#x27;m curious how the numbers would work.",1404231452

There&#x27;s a fairly significant bunch of young mathematicians who develop software and do extensive computer exploration to identify interesting patterns and attack hard problems in combinatorics.  But learning to be actually good at this requires a significant investment of time, meaning that our programming problem solvers are even further removed from the trendy world of algebraic geometry.  Just yesterday I was hearing a story of an algebraic geometer who worked with the late, great Alain Lascoux.  Lascoux did some interesting computations, which the geometer dropped in his talk without mention of where the numbers came from. He was quite resistant to think of the skill of actually computing these numbers as a real skill with merit...<p>There is a real need for problem solving; it can illuminate new directions when the combinatorics of combining existing theorems becomes exhausting.

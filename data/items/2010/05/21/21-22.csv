They start with a bang but they also realize Version 2 of a product, at its core, is strikingly similar to Version 10. I don't think they feel pressured to dominate a market probably because their business model doesn't require it. The iPod was a bit of a fluke in that sense. It had a lot more to do with the competition losing than Apple being hell bent on domination. Google on the other hand, like Microsoft in the past, needs to succeed with big volume.

And in fact Dylan got both multiple inheritance and operator overloading right before Java existed.<p>Method ordering is the most significant problem with multiple inheritance. You arrive at the simple (just use the lexical ordering of the superclass list) or the more complex (Dylan's method ordering, now also in Python) purely by reasoning logically. I'm pretty sure someone like Guy Steele would be able to figure this out.<p>Operator overloading: what could possibly be worse than x.multiply(y)? You either have a fixed list of operators that you can override by defining a method in a class, or you have an expandable set of operators for which you can specify the precedence and which way it associates. This is not a hard problem.",1274478778

It's important they say what they <i>have</i> to say (""won't be ready for six more months""), rather than what they think the customers want to hear (""coming really soon""). Be precise, not vague/subject to interpretation. ""Six months"" may be ""soon"" in a certain context, but as a customer, to me ""soon"" means ""the next 10 minutes"". They should instead be more precise.<p>It feels like they take me for a fool; I do understand and accept that projects slip schedules etc., but I don't enjoy being exposed as a naive fool every few months when the Wakemates wake up and make a ""coming soon"" blog post. In their last blog post, they said, ""coming soon, but this time we learnt from our mistakes, so our projected ship dates are even bogus, we are actually going to <i>beat</i> the dates we posted!"" -- <a href=""http://blog.wakemate.com/2010/04/01/first-units-shipping-new-store/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wakemate.com/2010/04/01/first-units-shipping-new...</a> -- so now my <i>expectation</i> is that they in fact <i>beat</i> the date they posted, and if they simply met their second commitment, I'd still feel like they screwed up! This is them setting themselves up for failure. Further, they invalidated the brownie points I would have handed out (""wow, they promised date X, but they actually beat it; maybe they're not so lame after all!"") ... if Wakemate shipped <i>right now</i>, they still don't get the brownie ... (""they promised they would beat the Sep 2010 date, and hey, they just beat it. whatever"") ... kinda sad side-effect which probably wasn't thought out before they made the blog post.<p>After <i>all this mess</i>, there is no space left for sympathy; ""oh, building hardware is hard!"" - sure it is, but if you make me look like a fool in the process, I don't really care if it's hard or not. The value of setting expectations is vastly under-rated, in my opinion.<p>Edit: And the blog post title could not have been more inappropriate - ""WakeMates are shipping!"" was the title - I clicked that to see where to get my tracking information, and instead I'm told ""Oh, wait until Sep 2010"".

Aubrey de Grey's degrees are not in the life sciences, and to my knowledge he's never been directly engaged in a biological research project.  Those of us who have done aging research understand how ridiculously difficult it can be to do things that sound simple on paper, and De Grey isn't even making proposals that are simple on paper.<p>On the other hand, he seems to be a smart, well-intentioned guy who has spent a lot of time developing a theoretical knowledge of how biological systems work.  De Grey's not going to spend your money on coke and whores, and he's not going to spend it developing the ultimate power crystal.  He's just underestimated the difficulty of solving the problem.<p>So if you think aging is a disease and not a natural process, it's probably underfunded and you should consider giving him money.

Reading and studying a lot about energy I do believe at this point that the real inconvenient truth is human production of CO2 is causing global warming.<p>The problem I have is all the focus on CO2 emission regulation. I do understand the politician they like to have some tool to regulate our energy consumption, but I am starting the conclusion that this whole cap and trade approach is the wrong road.\n\n<p>Some article describe this idea all the way to the next ponzi scheme, where the rich getter richer and the poor will loose out. As it is so massive in its approach that it is easy to envision how some people and corporation will make lots of money out of this. But the core issue on how to dramatically reduce energy consumption is left on the outside.<p>Am I a forming wrong ideas here or just read the wrong articles?\n",1274475695

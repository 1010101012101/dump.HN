The chance of flipping 8 heads in a row is 0.39% but given you have already flipped 7 heads the chance is now 50%.<p>The space for becoming successful is not directly predicated on the number of people attempting to or have already become successful, it is predicated on a whole set of traits, events and actions out of and in your control. Your chance in succeeding is not 1% or some other stupid number, it is an unknown quantity conditioned on your  circumstances. By tweaking those in your control you can increase you chance of success to a higher (or lower) number.<p>As you state, to become a billionaire for the sake of having some power of 10 of an abstract quantity tied to your name is a pretty empty way of life. Not to mention the justification for such a disproportionate distribution of wealth (unless you can argue that such an allocation allows a more efficient redistribution than otherwise, rarely the case) is frankly, unnecessary and possibly detrimental.<p>Anyways, seems to me that the solution is to have your definition of success be more meaningful than an arbitrary number and to realize that at any given point there are a set of goals that are more realizable than others, picking those which maximize some short term p(success) which also taking you closest to your long term definition of success is all it takes. It is the journey and not the destination that is important.<p>With constant engagement, feeling of moving forward and a wholesome but necessarily <i>subjective</i> notion of value then at any time you will be successful while at the same time becoming more successful. This to me seems to be pretty obvious and I have seen this advice in multiple forms in many places. Yet the original post and many others suggest this is not commonly held sense. This I do not understand.",1282389765

1622589,comment,1621767,1621767,0,0,abalashov,,,"From the point of view of a Soviet immigrant to the US, the predominant public reaction the author describes is quite bewildering.  It is hard for me to imagine how an 8 or 9 year old child riding a subway could be the basis of a sensational news story;  if anything, 8 or 9 sounds like a seasoned, advanced age.<p>I came here when I was 6, in 1992, and did quite a bit of my growing up subsequently in a well-tended, well-watched family-oriented graduate student housing facility on the campus of a private university.  Not exactly the 'hood.  My parents, as all the (predominantly foreign) residents there, were busy graduate students trying to make it on a ~$10k/year stipend with student visa-based work restrictions, and, being in the humanities field, faced quite daunting demands to excel so distinctively according to the rules of their field in order to have a stab at staying in this country after their visa ran out.  So, of course, they were busy working/studying until 10-11 PM.<p>Never in my wildest dreams as a Moscow child could I have imagined that leaving me alone in that highly enclosed, heavily security-patrolled, communal environment full of watchful neighbours and fellow parents would be considered ""child neglect"" under Indiana state law, nor that, in fact, it would be so until the age of 12 to leave me home alone for _any_ amount of time, strictly speaking, as a statutory matter.<p>In fact, I was one of the very few children of ex-USSR or Eastern European extraction who was not, at some point during this tenure, essentially kidnapped by university security with no notice given to the parents and placed in a foster family for a few days while the shocked and aggrieved parents were badgered with saber-rattling about child neglect by whatever state agency.  I avoided it narrowly by a stroke of luck;  on many occasions, e.g. winter nights, when I was playing outside - in the dark! - at the precarious hour (!) of 8 PM, I saw the university cops peering out of their patrol cars, eyeing me like prey. Honestly, these keystone cops were a far greater danger to my welfare than any conceivable predator.  They were often unpleasant and openly contemptuous, amplifying the psychologically traumatic fear of police and other martial authorities that is already built into any child of Soviet parents by inheritance.  To this day, I still have this reaction to cops that I must surely be ""guilty"" of something, even though I'm innocent.  The way that they provided foundations for that feeling, with their hostile dispositions, abrasive lines of questioning, etc. was a lot more injurious to my development as an individual than free association with other kids until mid-evening in a protected communal yard.<p>It is difficult to imagine a safer environment for a child than the kind of place that this was.  If there were ever a place where there were some adults around at almost times, and neighbours you knew and could count on in case of an emergency, this was definitely it.<p>The stream of sanctimonious busybodies from the state child/welfare agency that would occasionally come around to harass these poor, tired foreigners was just unbelievable.  Now that I've lived in Georgia for 10 years, I make an analogy to what Georgia's agency - DFACS (Department of Family and Children's Services) - spends its time doing in predominantly working-class Hispanic-occupied trailor parks and poor black neighbourhoods down here.<p>Some of this is just an incorrigible cultural and institutional defect, as other comments have pointed out.  Another important difference with the USSR specifically, though, is that we had households with two working parents for a lot longer than has been normative in the US;  our entry of women into the workforce dates back almost to the revolution, in keeping with the Marxist gender equality premise.  So, Soviet society developed institutional solutions and accommodations[1] for this relatively early.  A necessary consequence is that children had to lead a parent-independent existence much earlier in their lives than if the premise of a full-time stay-at-home mother is granted.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Russia#Pre-school_education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Russia#Pre-school_...</a> -- see the paragraph (""The Soviet system..."")",1282389276

It’s impossible to get such a effect with a digital camera or color film in an analog camera. You can only get it when combining different exposures.<p>Also, digital cameras have no shutter lag, at least not noticeable. The problem is autofocus, that’s what takes time.<p>Pretty much all non-DSLR cameras use contrast detection for focusing. The lens quickly shifts from the closest possible focus distance to infinity and the camera looks for contrast changes on the picture. If the contrast is high the camera knows that the picture is sharp. (This leads to dismal failures whenever you want to take a photo of something with inherently low contrast like a white wall.) DSLRs use optical phase detectors which give direct distance readings, the lens is then shifted to the correct setting. (As you can imagine, this method is faster than contrast detection.)<p>This process just takes time. That didn’t happen to you with older cameras because they don’t have autofocus. All you have to do is remember to focus long before you plan on taking the picture, that was the case when you could only manually focus and that is still the case today.

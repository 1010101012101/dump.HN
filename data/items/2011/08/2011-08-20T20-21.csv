My idea of a downvote is an article where I felt I lost IQ for reading it. In the case of the kid’s mistaken result, is there any question his research and theory were interesting? Does anyone honestly feel stupider for having read about it and considered the possibility that he was correct?<p>Quite honestly, almost everything that makes it to the front page of HN is wrong. We talk about software development, startups, muse about whether Apple is brilliant or is lucky enough to have lame competition, argue about Haskell and Erlang... All stuff that is non-empirical and therefore unfalsifiable.<p>How does that stuff get a free pass to be on the front page of HN without peer-reviewed research backing it up? I’ll tell you how: We’re smart enough to know that all of that stuff is probably at least partly wrong, but if there’s something in there that makes us smarter, it’s worth reading and upvoting and discussing.<p>If the kid’s ideas had in them just one thing that made us smarter for having thought about it... That’s a win, that’s worth upvoting and repeating. Why wait for peer review? As long as nobody ran out and dropped a million bucks on manufacturing solar arrays, what’s the harm? If anything is wrong with an article, a day or so later, all of the flaws will be corrected. And thats exactly what has happened here.<p>Thinking about this, I don’t see a problem with the “blogosphere” or with HN upvoting and tweeting and repeating the original article. Thank goodness we don’t put everything through a peer-review first. I’d say things are working just fine, and I encourage every other thirteen year-old kid to experiment and publish.<p>No harm, no foul. There’s nothing in there that’s more wrong than anything I’ve ever said in a blog post or a comment, it’s just easier to prove where empirical science is concerned.

What price could you ask for those shoes? Also imagine that your neighbor could buy the same robot for the same price you paid it, let's say the equivalent of 1,000 times the price you wanted to sell your shoes at. What would happen?<p>Robots don't get paid for their ""work""; it's their owners and their operators that get the money. Moreover, robots don't vote, but workers do. Between (imperfect) market competition and (imperfect) democracy, goods that are created with very little human work and that aren't very rare will always command very little prices compared to work-intensive goods, if the system is given enough time to adapt.<p>So we could end up in a world where one massage by a (human) masseuse will be worth 1,000 shoes. That wouldn't be such a big problem. The real issue is how fast we get there: People need time to adapt, to retrain, to give different relative values to different things.<p>What is really disrupting is a change that is too fast. But in the long run, even if we'll all be dead, as Keynes said, it won't be automation that will create world misery.

2907680,comment,2906121,2907580,1,0,nxn,,,"> However, the rendering or parsing in a dynamic language like JavaScript or Python typically takes one line of code. The equivalent in something like Java can be horrible. [...] you still have the problems of how to describe that format.<p>I'm not familiar with Java, but in the scenario I illustrated it took 0 lines of your own code to receive a JSON structure, and one line to return one. That's outside of defining the structure itself (creating the class; what I think you mean by ""the problem of describing the format""), but generally you'd want to do the exact same thing in a dynamic language to make working with the structure easier. Example: you still define model classes in a Django app.<p>> ... and how to handle errors where the incoming JSON doesn't match your expected format in some way.<p>I don't see how you wouldn't have the same exact problem in a dynamic language. You can't just receive input and know magically what to do with it, you need to have the input be in a defined/expected form in order to process it. This to me is outside of dilemma of dynamic vs static because it is a problem in both approaches.<p>>  I suppose you could simplify common cases by determining the expected format using reflection if your language supports it, but that's not going to be powerful enough to cope with the general case without providing some sort of metadata as well.<p>Right, in the scenario I gave the framework looked at the signature of the controller, saw that it expected to receive an object of such and such type, and told the serializer to use the JSON data to create an instance of that type. I'm not sure what more metadata would be needed to make that work? I suppose if you get a parsing error you can just use the exception handler in your client code because the client submitted data in the wrong format, etc.<p>> In short, I'm still waiting to find a library that can parse arbitrary incoming JSON within a statically typed language without at best requiring the programmer to repeat structural information that is already implicit in the code that uses the resulting object.<p>Defining a class once and saying you expect to receive an instance of it is not ""repeating structural information"" in my opinion. I can only see it as being ""repeated"" if you look at the initial JSON data structure as sort of the type itself. I personally look at the role of JSON to be a ""data container"" and not a ""structure descriptor"", but if that's the way you like looking at it, well then yeah, dynamic typing is going to be your best bet right now. The closest I can think of is Haskell's type inference which constrains types based on how they're used in the function, but even then the types have to be defined at compile time, and it will not just create one for you that matches what you're trying to do at run time -- it just accepts already defined ones based on whether they meet the constraints gathered from the code.",1313873224

2907673,comment,2906121,2907614,1,0,nirvana,,,"I think the pids are getting confused.  When I say pid, I mean an id for a combination of a given function and some data, an instance, a fake sort of process that is facilitated by my code invoking the function with the data from its mailbox, whenever there is a message sent to the function by another ""process"".  I'm not talking about erlang processes or ""real"" processes.  So, you wouldn't have the problem of the ""pid might not be allocated yet"" because you would allocated it.<p>example in pseudo coffeerlangscript:<p>init-> \n pidOne = spawn(functionA, argumentlist),\n pidTwo = spawn(functionA, differentarguments),\n contextSet(""pidOne"",pidOne),\n contextSet(""pidTwo"",pidTwo),\n lookupData(bucket, key, pidOne),\n lookupData(bucket, key, functionB).<p>functionA(message) ->\n doStuff().<p>So, the here you're ""spawning"" two processes. For a function to act like a process it is written such that it takes any messages it get as arguments.  I could set up their own contexts too, so ""contextSet"" in pidOne and pidTwo would be unique namespaces.  LookupData, instead of taking a function to invoke, takes a process, and sends a message when it has retrieved the data off of the disk.<p>FunctionB could send a message or to pidOne and pidTwo (which it can find in the context).<p>So, the init phase is here, and later the start phase will be called.  But the thread of execution would be: init, then the database queries happen in parallel, when they are successful, pidOne gets a message and functionB are called (possibly running in different environments.) FunctionB sends a message to pidOne and pidTwo, both of which are invoked with these new messages.  When there are no more messages waiting for any of these pseudo processes, and no more database queries or other long running processes running in parallel, then the next phase is called.<p>If you're saying there's a better way to do this, my ears are open, I just need a little more explanation.",1313872961

Outside of erlang, (and some equivalently obscure environments) little attempt has been made to make concurrent processes manageable, and this is why you see the predominance of event-based systems.  We're in a multi-core era and and you can't really say you're ""concurrent"" when your event model only runs on a single core.<p>While I think, if your choices are the typical thread support and its problems and an event based system then events are the way to go... I believe the great majority of developers have decided to use node or twisted, et. al, either because they'd never heard of erlang, never understood its strength, or weren't willing to deal with the initially alien looking syntax.<p>I think this is a mistake, but rather than fight it, I'm working on a solution that allows coffeescript to run within a distributed system based on erlang. I've had to provide some work arounds and conventions for the coffeescript developer to follow a sequential programming style, but have the ability for coffeescript to really run concurrently on multiple CPUs or multiple machines, with a common shared state.<p>(I described some of this here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2906290"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2906290</a> and went into the architecture a bit more here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2848647"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2848647</a> )<p>Granted, it is easy for me to say it should be done a different way, and until I publish code it is all talk.  I'm very aware of this... but I would like to suggest that there really is a difference in erlang, and that events are a compromise that don't inherently actually allow for concurrency.  Concurrency is a better solution, isn't that hard to do now (if you write straight up erlang) and I'm working on making it even easier (if you're willing to be constrained a little, bit, but I think the popularity of node.js shows people are willing.)<p>If it seems I'm shilling for my project, I am a little bit, but I'm also wanting to get it out there so that if I'm making a mistake maybe someone can identify it... or be inspired to build a better way on top of it.<p>If you want updates, I have a twitter account @nirvanacore that only talks about this project.",1313871304

(xp tablet edition).<p>Eventually I gave up and reverted to using a clip board with 20 sheets of paper.  Paper was just a better technological solution to the problems I had.<p>Things that I _really liked:  \n>Being able to annotate and write on a Word Doc or on a scanned document with a stylus was really, really nice.<p>>Not having to keep 20 pieces of paper organized was huge.<p>>Having a large screen that was internet connected if I needed to look something up on the fly was amazing.<p>>One Note is _really, _really nice software, and completely developed with that type of computer in mind.  Being able to annotate a doc, and add sound, video and handwriting was amazingly cool, and quite intuitive.  Built in features like the calculator, and table creation were quite astonishing.<p>>Handwriting recognition was quite trainable, and fairly easy to use after a while.  Generally, I didn't have to use the handwriting recognition at all, I could just write down notes in One Note.<p>>Stylus use was a huge plus.  I can't stand writing on an screen using touch only.  I've tried tons of different on screen keyboards, and I've never found one that I like.  Annotating things or writing by finger painting has never been good for me.<p>Things which stopped me from using it:<p>But, where the model broke down completely:<p>>Username and password inputs.  The handwriting recognition in XP tablet was built around recognizing entire words, not combinations of symbols and words.  So, trying to get a username that wasn't in the dictionary recognized as such, and then getting a password filled in while not being able to see what was being typed in the password field were complete dealbreakers after several months.  What I usually ended up having to do, was bring up the onscreen keyboard, and click 25 to 30 times to inpute my uid/pwd every time I had to log into the hospital's software system, which timed out every 4 minutes unless I was active on it.  So, I ended up logging on to the system with 30 clicks, about 10 times an hour, which was infuriating.<p>>Portrait vs landscape.  I carried the tablet around with me in portrait mode all the time.  Using a tablet/stylus like a clipboard/pen is extremely intuitive.  Desktop applications generally expect a landscape orientation, however. It's hard to carry a tablet in landscape mode and write with one hand...  it gets really easy to drop the tablet.<p>>Weight, and battery life were also pretty big concerns.  I worked 12 hour shifts.  I don't think that there has been a battery / portable computing device combination that has been created that can stand up to 12 hours of constant wireless / touchscreen use that is portable.<p>All that being said, I'm looking forward to seeing Windows 8's touch first approach to these problems.  I also suspect hardware manufactures know something the rest of us don't.  A walk down a Fry's netbook / laptop aisle in San Jose shows a _ton of touch screen enabled laptops and netbooks.

They're not though, and they're probably not for the fact that they're dynamically typed and that often causes chaos when there's that many people involved and communicating with them becomes a job in and of itself. The more you have to spell out things in your code the less likely another person will misunderstand its meaning.<p>Anyway, I personally would still prefer a statically typed language just for the added compile time safety. To me the ""save + refresh browser + manually check if change works"" process of development is way more tedious than having to work with type constraints that fail to compile if they don't make sense. That and decent type inference really helps in 90% of the cases where static typing seemed tedious to me.",1313870781

2907580,comment,2906121,2907468,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Of course just about every language has a freely available library for working with JSON, and that is one of the main reasons to use JSON in the first place. However, the rendering or parsing in a dynamic language like JavaScript or Python typically takes one line of code. The equivalent in something like Java can be horrible.<p>Even if you have a library that can parse JSON according to some known format and give you back a nice object of some known type in your static type system, you still have the problems of how to describe that format and how to handle errors where the incoming JSON doesn't match your expected format in some way. I suppose you could simplify common cases by determining the expected format using reflection if your language supports it, but that's not going to be powerful enough to cope with the general case without providing some sort of metadata as well.<p>In short, I'm still waiting to find a library that can parse arbitrary incoming JSON within a statically typed language without at best requiring the programmer to repeat structural information that is already implicit in the code that uses the resulting object. It's just that architectural issue I mentioned before, where converting from a freeform format to a known object type in a static language essentially requires you to do all the parsing and error recovery up-front whether you want to or not. Perhaps someone has come up with a clever approach I haven't yet encountered, but I don't see any sign of it in the documentation I looked up quickly for the libraries you mentioned; they look downright painful to use compared to dynamic languages from the code snippets I saw!",1313870687

2907574,comment,2906455,2906455,2,0,nopinsight,,,"From my analysis below, especially on simple math about taxation and the nature of democracy, it seems Martin Ford is wrong.<p>Suppose that the production of almost everything (clothes, furniture, etc.) and most services is automated to the degree that the process itself costs almost nothing, but still requires raw materials to produce. The scarce factors would be raw materials, energy, and key human resources (product designers, system engineers, roboticists, venture capitalists, etc.). (There will remain certain services that are not automated, but these require only a small fraction of the population to provide.) The main earners would be those key people and the owners of raw materials and energy resources. We can suppose they make up a small fraction of the population. These people will earn huge income and can afford many luxuries of life. Some portions of their income will be taxed and distributed to the mass.<p>Since much of the production and distribution costs will be eliminated, more and better products/services can be provided. Let's say four times more or better than in the current world. Even though the rest of the population receive only a fraction (say 25%) of the income through governmental distributive scheme, this could be equal to the total amount that the current production creates. In a democratic country, political pressure will mount to distribute enough income for everyone to be fairly satisfied with their material well-being and something like 25% is a rate that the riches will likely accept. Since the riches will comprise a small fraction of the population, they will be pampered in a lot of ways, not unlike in the current world. The key difference is that the middle class and the poor will become one and the same since the jobs of most current middle-class would have been automated away. (We are talking about the economic aspect, there might still be differences among these two classes based on education, family background, for example).<p>Overall, this would be a world where say 5% of the population designs, analyses, manages, and faciliates automation, 10% provides services that are not yet replaced by automation, 3% owns raw materials, 2% governs, and the rest lives pretty well-off at least for non-competitive products. The 80% might not get to own beach-front properties or products designed exactly to their personal tastes (which require work from good designers), but they will live materially better than most of us now.  How they choose to spend free time would be an interesting issue to explore. I am optimistic though that the world where most people are free to pursue their own interests without needing to work on things they don't enjoy will be a better world. I’d love to see this actually happening sooner than later.<p>In conclusion, if the automation is significant enough to put the majority of the population out of work, it will also likely create such a large surplus that people will be materially better off through reasonable tax rates on the productive workers and capital owners. A caveat that might ruin this utopian scenario is in the case we and supercomputers in the future cannot find a way to live sustainably given the raw materials and energy resources we have access to from this earth (or other planets).",1313870546

If, in a given phase, you have some data, you add it to the context, it will be there in the next phase.<p>It would be easy to have an API that is along the lines of ""in the next phase, call this function, pass it this data"".  I could make an API that does that, or you could put the data under a key in the context, and then call that function at the beginning of the next phase.  IF the set of functions you'd like to have called that way varies from request to request, they could be stuffed in a list under a key, and you just process each of the functions in that list.<p>I think it will be quite possible to provide something equivalent to closures, via an API, though I can't yet say how syntactically convenient they will be, but really not too bad, I don't think.<p>On further thought, I think it would be quite possible to do actor style message passing... I'm focusing a bit much on the mechanics of implementation right now, and not making this transparent, but the context could easily be used to manage a set of mailboxes and ""processes"", where, in each phase, or even between phases, whenever a message is available in a mailbox, the function that it was sent to gets woken up and executed. In fact, not function, but process.<p>So, I can add an API that provides an actor model interface. The actors can be identified by a process ID, they can send messages to each other (addressed by PID) and include arbitrary data, and this can happen in concurrently in coffeescript.",1313870488

Ok. That means that the kid has shown a way to orient the cells so they get sunlight for a longer period of time. If evolution is anything to go by, his approach likely reveals a local minima for maximizing the time that sunlight is collected.<p>Is that worthless? No, it is not. It may well explain why trees orient their leaves the way they do, and there could well be practical applications. If your solar array produces more than the peak power you need but the cost and energy loss of storing the power are significant, you may well want to use a pattern like this that mimics what trees do.<p>What impresses me is that the kid noticed something in nature he hadn't noticed before, read up on it to see what was known about this pattern, and then went out and measured to see whether what he had read was accurate. Once he had verified what he read, he then figured out how that knowledge might be applied. In doing so, he discovered something that, while obvious in hindsight, is not something that would necessarily have occurred to someone trying to figure out how to maximize the time for solar panels to deliver energy. I think the kudos are appropriate, even if the stories are misleading.<p>An important point here is that in any news story about something that you know a lot about, there are always errors. Always.

At its core, it's premised on the idea that threads are inherently easier than events, because they produce straight-line code and automatically handle tracking the state needed across a transaction. If that's true, then the article says threads are just as good as events once we solve all the problems that make threads dangerous or slow.<p>But it's not a given that threads are easy. In particular, as anyone who has spent time doing high-performance threaded code will tell you, there's the effort you have to put in to make sure your threaded code is correct, and then the 2x more time you have to put in to make sure that it's efficient; in particular, you have to do synchronization without effectively serializing all your threads. Which is a huge pain.<p>I think this is gradually becoming a moot point, as modern languages --- all of which have some kind of anonymous function and some approximation of closures --- allow us to write evented code that looks and feels like straight-line code. jQ callbacks in Javascript are the most vivid illustration of this idea (I suppose the node.js people are carrying that even further; I haven't played with it).",1313870409

The default with logstash was to store each field, and then the whole text so stuff go quite large for our web logs. Also the Kibana interface was pretty buggy. Parsing our logs (~2k entries) a second doesn&#x27;t work well with Regex so in our version we do a bunch of substring stuff. I&#x27;m excited about Kibana/ES for the rest of our logs over with their recent hire.<p>When I looked at StatsD and Graphite last time I didn&#x27;t really see an API. I really like the model of data being queryable and returning nice serialized format like json (like OpenTSDB does).

Another &quot;let&#x27;s-act-like-everything-is-happiness-and-rainbows&quot; post.<p>In my experience, most of the time someone says &quot;this is shit&quot;, it actually is, and it&#x27;s indicative of serious failures in the hiring/training/code-review/management process.<p>The only ways that companies improve at those processes are by pointing out the shit, calling it by its name, and figuring out the best ways to keep it from happening again.<p>Having a &quot;this is shit&quot; culture can be GOOD -- it can hold people accountable and promote a culture of excellence.<p>> <i>In the end it is a culture that values negativity rather than focus on solutions.</i><p>That doesn&#x27;t follow. Call it shit, <i>and then fix it</i>.<p>> <i>Start by understanding the code, and then find ways to improve upon it.</i><p>That means that, instead of fixing the underlying problem and making people accountable for their work, <i>you</i> take on the burden of cleaning after other people&#x27;s shit? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>The author is correct when they say:<p>> <i>Don&#x27;t blurt out negative assessments of others code for no reason, and with no understanding. ...Start by understanding the code</i><p>But that goes without saying. Don&#x27;t be too quick to judge when you don&#x27;t have the facts. But once you&#x27;re sure the code is shit, it&#x27;s ultimately counterproductive to hide that. Most employees will only start writing better code once they&#x27;re expected to, and strongly held accountable -- like most people&#x27;s performance in any job.<p>PS: To be clear, I&#x27;m not talking about disagreements over coding styles, etc. I&#x27;m talking about code with obtuse function names and no comments. I&#x27;m talking about CSS that is hack upon hack upon hack filled with negative margins and !important&#x27;s. I&#x27;m talking about JavaScript that pollutes the global namespace by programmers who refuse to use &quot;var&quot;.

You can not open an Chrome app in a tab anymore. Basically, you now have an extra window whenever you open a chrome app. This is very annoying since when you click on the existing window the app is hidden in the back, you have to flip through your windows on the mac to find the app you just opened again.<p>-Javascript execution permissions are very strict, and no longer follows that of a normal webpage.<p>The result is, you can no longer build an HTML5 app and prepare it for the chrome store, you have to specifically change the code to package it.

It is unreal if you see it.<p>Following the news and hanging out with my old friends talking about the energy policy in Germany I learned very quickly how messed up this is now.<p>A kWh is now 34cent and continues to explode and it is not surprising given how the German politician approached their energy policy. It is a long article with lots of depth, but this statement captures the core of the problem, Swedish utilities have an interest in maximizing their return on investment. This is different in Germany, where the most inefficient technology at a given time is the most heavily subsidized.<p>Twenty years ago when I graduated with my EE I learned about the challenge of storing efficient and cost effective energy in the GW and that has not been resolved. This energy policy is a good example when a free market with demand and supply is ignored. The politician do not understand the technical details, have lots of special interest influencers and set policies in place which can have some really negative long term effect. The thinking is they just can overrule a market by subsidizing, but this works only to a certain level. I am all for renewable energy, but I do think it has to be done in a competitive way otherwise it is unsustainable in the long run.<p>It is really bizarre to read that a country investing billions in a zero emission energy solution now increases its CO2 emission by 2 percent. When I visited I heard the story from the wind turbine on Borkum as well and though that something went seriously wrong here, but as always when politics is involved no one is accountable.",1378400017

You won&#x27;t have any collisions unless you do some kind of precise coordination between them. In fact, you likely only have a shot at getting the same timestamp if you call from different threads, because just executing the instructions to read the current time takes long enough that two calls in a row will get different values.<p>> TL;DR: microsecond timestamps do not provide sufficient entropy for uniqueness constraints over common workloads.<p>See, that&#x27;s the part I have a problem with, because I&#x27;ve had quite the opposite experience (without even having Cassandra involved).",1378399693

This is why <i>that&#x27;s what happened</i>: PayPal doesn&#x27;t just steal your money and leave, they put various restrictions on your account that mitigate the risks involved in your business.<p>The most simple thing that they can do, and which tends to be the first recourse (and thereby the one that, if you don&#x27;t go insane with a public rant you can negotiate down from) is a 180-day hold.<p>If you call PayPal, however, and demonstrate that you shipped these products, showing some kind of documentation of shipment, PayPal will release your funds immediately.

You&#x27;re concluding that because 1/x startups succeed, the odds of each person&#x27;s startup succeeding is 1/x. You can see this clearly if you ask what the probability is that someone is over 6 feet tall. Although 1/x people are, the probability for each person is either 1 or 0. And while no one&#x27;s chances of succeeding are 1, the startup case is closer to the height example than to rolling dice. Someone like the young Bill Gates would have a much higher probability of succeeding than a person selected at random.)<p>More convincing evidence of this (and evidence that this analogy applies to the case of startups) would be to compare the probability of someone who has already succeeded at a startup working on a new startup versus someone who has never worked at a startup before or has failed in their previous attempts.

If you do bother with the username/password, you have to store <i>those</i> somewhere (remember, automated system). So now instead of running psexec directly, you have to have a tool that grabs the password file, hopefully decrypts it, <i>then</i> runs psexec.<p>Also, iirc, using the psexec interface from Linux in a Linux->Windows connection does not work (a wrinkle in the original story is that it was a Linux->Windows connection).<p>[1] <a href=""http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/psexec"" rel=""nofollow"">http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/psexec</a>",1378397046

It is not possible to solve for &quot;Does there exist a strategy that, regardless of opponents play, guarantees maximum profits&quot;. You can solve it for not losing money, but you cant solve it for making the max amount of money.<p>Trivially it&#x27;s not possible to write software that beats any opponent (because what would it do playing against itself?) . Less trivially, any game that has a finite amount of decisions (and limit hold-em does) has at least one Nash equilibrium, so there exists a strategy that will at least have you break even.<p>The way to solve the game is to calculate your odds of winning based on previous actions and ensure that you take actions that make any future decision of the opponent have the same outcome (to reach a Nash equilibrium).<p>That strategy hasnt been calculated yet, but the best limit players are most likely playing very close to it, at least if you compare to the best no-limit players playing no-limit (the variable amounts possible to bid in no-limit multiplies  the possible strategies massively).",1378396833

But the benefit of not having to worry about unexpected changed or sometimes referencing something you didn&#x27;t mean too is great.<p>The added performance can come from the equality checks. Like, do not do anything if newState === oldState. This has added benefit with something like React where you can use shouldCOmponentUpdate, which we returned false, will not call the render function. It can increase performance drastically on complicated things.",1442239191

I am regularily hosting Hoffices and am part of the group steering the Hoffice network and so far I&#x27;ve never heard of any of the problems you mentioned happening... Hoffice is completely based on gift and trust principles. This assumes that people who get invited into your home won&#x27;t sue you afterwards, if some kind of accident happens. But this is of course not certain and a host might take a certain risk here.<p>In terms of taxation I believe that there is no real threat, as one of the basic premises is that you host without charging money for it. It&#x27;s a gift to all people participating. In return you get the a group feeling and motivation to work from your guests. Furthermore Hoffice includes a potluck lunch culture, where everybody contributes to a buffet. As home working as such is not taxed, I don&#x27;t see why homeworking together should be.",1442239124

Already we can see you&#x27;re not quite clear on what the problem is.<p>On the other hand, <i>cutting</i> down a forest to make room for a farm might well be a good idea, but probably not for only &quot;a few years worth of farming&quot;.<p>Why would someone operate a farm for only a few years when it <i>could</i> produce him wealth <i>indefinitely</i>?

Public transport is irrelevant to the earlier discussion. If bad decisions are made in that sphere, blame it on the government.<p>> <i>A simple metastable suboptimal state example is extreme income inequality - it took years to get out of another metastable state - more sensible income distribution</i><p>&quot;Metastable&quot; sounds like a term some academic self-proclaimed philosopher might use.

When I started, I provided support for another product, but over time became familiar with all of the tools and eventually managed the technical support team.<p>We would frequently get support requests from companies asking for ways to detect and/or prevent SoftICE, and we had some nice reply templates trying to break it gently to them how there was no practical way for software loaded after SoftICE to reliably stop a determined user from debugging and/or tampering with it.<p>The SoftICE tech support issues were always the tough ones.  We had a small team of elites who would slog through those issues while the other team members could only wonder what they were talking about sometimes. :)  Some companies even resorted to shipping hardware to the team to help reproduce and resolve tough issues.<p>My favorite memory though is when I was learning SoftICE and I  grabbed one of the guys and asked them if they could help me figure out a weird issue with it.  As we walked over, I shared with them that every time I broke into SoftICE, my CRT monitor would shut off, and it wouldn&#x27;t come back on until I closed SoftICE.  I asked them if it could be some sort of new countermeasure.<p>They looked at me with that disbelieving look one shares with a mere novice, and sat down at my computer and pressed Ctrl-D.  Click! Off went the monitor.  Their eyes bugged just a bit and they tentatively toggled the power switch just to make sure.  Dead.  With hesitation, they typed the command to close the SoftICE window and blinked as the monitor hummed back to life.<p>As I said though, these guys were good.  After hitting Ctrl-D a few more times and watching the monitor switch off and on, this person didn&#x27;t let the mystery send them down any rabbit holes.  They immediately went fishing for the monitor power cable and traced it to the plug where they found a suspicious looking box it was plugged into.  As they looked back at me with a glare, I guiltily held up the remote control for the power switch and fessed up.<p>Good times.",1442238741

10215014,comment,10213547,10213547,0,0,cryoshon,,,"Uhh, I think Thiel doesn&#x27;t understand what is going on here. I am going to respond to a few excerpts.<p>&quot;The question is, can you change those probabilities into different numbers? The reason we invested in Stemcentrx at a valuation that would have been higher than many other biotechs we looked at is that we felt the whole company was designed to get these probabilities as close to one as possible at every step, to get rid of as much of this randomness or contingency as possible. That is something that we found deeply reassuring.&quot;<p>Broadly speaking there are two strategies for drug research: shotgun, and sniper rifle. If we&#x27;re being honest, shotgun is the dominant method specifically because 10 chances is far safer than 1 &quot;really good&quot; shot that may or may not produce a really good drug. The one shot wonder shops usually fail early stage when they can&#x27;t produce a chain of positive data from one funding round to the next. Biotech startups are longshots-- I would say that they are probably even longer shots than a software shop specifically because there can be unknown physical constraints of biology that can silently ruin an otherwise great idea, leaving other people to make the exact same mistake repeatedly after you&#x27;re gone. Reducing inconsistency of your results is a core of the scientific method, practiced everywhere, but doing so effectively is hard when you don&#x27;t have full understanding of any one component you work with. It isn&#x27;t random behavior, it&#x27;s just not fully understood behavior.<p>&quot;One of the very unusual things they do is graft human cancer into the mice. It’s a somewhat more expensive way to do this than studying cancer in cell culture. It’s a somewhat harder structure to build. But drugs tested this way are much more likely to work in humans. They convinced me there is a surprising amount that has gone wrong with the cancer cell lines people have been studying. &quot;<p>Literally everyone who is serious about making oncology drugs does this technique. It&#x27;s a staple. I guess it&#x27;s &quot;unusual&quot; if you aren&#x27;t accustomed to the methods of biotechnology, but rest assured, this trick has been well-known for quite a while-- it is not a magic bullet, but it&#x27;s better than alternatives. Cancer cell lines are known to be poor models in a number of dimensions, which is great because we can anticipate their shortcomings. Mouse models also have shortcomings that are somewhat well understood, but don&#x27;t confuse this for a slam dunk. There are still many (most?) cases in which drugs developed from mice won&#x27;t transfer to humans.<p>&quot;But if biotech companies tend to invest money in ways that are pseudo random, then a lot of it must get wasted. You end up doing things where you say, “I am not sure it’s going to work.” Well, that sounds like a wasteful thing to do. The standard excuse that biotech companies have is that, “We don’t know if it’s going to work, so we have to do it this way.” That has to be inefficient.&quot;<p>Is this guy serious? You&#x27;re never sure if it&#x27;s going to work in the laboratory! Research is mostly &quot;try something new, then try another new thing when that fails.&quot; It&#x27;s &quot;wasteful&quot; because it&#x27;s guided trial and error, and you don&#x27;t have full totalitarian control over any of the variables. If you think you are investing in a new biotech company (or old, really) that has escaped this paradigm, I have a series of pyramids to sell you.<p>&quot;This idea was very much in my mind by the time we invested in Stemcentrx in 2012. They had an annoyingly complicated problem, all these pieces you have to bring together, and they said, “We are just going to do it ourselves.” That is a mind-set that I very deeply share. I don’t want to name names, but there are other companies where, in some ways, this was the key thing that failed.&quot;<p>All biotech problems are annoyingly complicated, and the prerequisites for trying to solve problems are also annoyingly complicated. There are some extremely well funded companies that can do everything in house, but it&#x27;s the wrong way to go about a startup-- even a lot of the larger biotechs contract stuff extensively. Why have problems with simple things that should work when you could contract them out and not worry? You can always bring that capability online in parallel in your own company at a later stage when you have more breathing room. It&#x27;s a huge hassle to buy equipment, hire and train your own people to perform a task that someone else can do better and cheaper.<p>&quot;The big picture is the question of whether biological science can be transformed into an information science. Can something that seems chaotic, fractal, and generally random be transformed into something more deterministic and more controlled?<p>&quot;I think of aging and maybe just mortality as random things that go wrong. The older you get, the more random things happen, the more breaks. If it’s not cancer, you could get hit by an asteroid. So on some level, technology is trying to overcome the randomness that is nature. That is a question on the level of a company. Can you get rid of randomness in building a company? But the philosophical version of the question is whether we can get rid of randomness in its entirety and overcome the randomness that I think of as the evil part of nature.&quot;<p>Nature isn&#x27;t random! Nature is complex, cryptic, self-referential, and chaotic, but it&#x27;s deterministic at the level of biology. &quot;Random things happening&quot; is not a proper understanding of age-related decline; aging is the long-term compounding interest of metabolic byproducts. It really stuns me that Thiel&#x27;s understanding of these things is so apathetic to reality.",1442238506

However, it is well known and documented by themselves that their culture has values that avoid risk and those that take risks are looked upon as foolish and shunned for failure. That&#x27;s more a collective decision made by their society and one that can be changed over time or individuals can choose to deviate from.  Their economy has seen stagnant growth because there just isn&#x27;t the start-up culture you see in other countries. Just look at the web design of a typical Japanese web site if you want to see how adverse the culture is with experimenting with anything new once they find something and establish it as standard.<p>Disclaimer: Also, there are no real judgments being made on a culture being risk adverse either. Obviously, that carries its own advantages that has probably greatly benefited their country over time. However, anything can be detrimental if taken too far to an extreme. Obviously, if no one ever takes risks or deviates from accepted norms of how you do things, you are less likely to find a new way of doing something or as quickly adapt to changes in the economy. If you want to encourage entrepreneurial businesses, its a cultural value that will need to be dealt with, where as it probably has great advantages in an normal office culture or an island nation where there are few natural resources and everyone lives in tightly packed spaces.",1442237482

Men and women working side by side has been normal or at least not noteworthy for a couple hundred thousand years... a couple decades of men only manual labor factory buildings was the weird oddity.  What I&#x27;m getting at is the innovation isn&#x27;t &quot;allowing&quot; women to stop eating bonbons on the couch and go to work, the &quot;innovation&quot; is all male manual labor assembly line factories died out and blew away, so things are now back to more or less normal with men and women more or less working together more or less most of the time plus or minus geography and climate and individual worksite and individual instantaneous work task.  Aside from fixations on imaginary pasts that never or rarely existed in the first place but fit a modern political axe to grind.  Men and women not spending time together is really pretty weird on a long enough time scale.<p>This also shows up in the car predictions.  Burning basically all our fossil energy resources in a century or so is really weird behavior, so the results are going to be very weird and very temporary and very dependent at any instant on the trajectory of that very rapid burn rate and very rapid economically viable depletion rate.  There&#x27;s a classic graph that shows fossil fuel use over the history of our species as a flat line around zero with a crazy vertical line blip right about now.  You can&#x27;t make long term trend predictions about a random sized and located momentary blip.<p>Finally an aspect of naming games.  We have reasonably cheap extremely safe 500 mph self driving machines that we sit in while reading legacy newspapers just like we always claimed we&#x27;d have, we just call them jet airplanes instead of calling them cars.  That doesn&#x27;t mean the prediction the machines would exist was wrong, or that we don&#x27;t sit in them and read newspapers today, it just means we insist on marketing them under a different name, not exactly a major miss for the prediction.  So predictions of everyone having electric cars will basically be correct in that average peasants like us will use electricity in the daily grind of life, even if some marketing guy insists on calling it the electric minivan or the e-Bus or the Apple iStationWagon, OK whatever its still basically &quot;everyone uses electric cars&quot; in practice.",1442237442

Could everything still work if they were separated?<p>2. What do Vector2 and Vector3 look like?  What if they say &quot;int a, b&quot; and &quot;int a, b, c&quot; respectively?  If a perfectly-aligned &quot;new int[total]&quot; would have fixed the problem, it should have been tried from the start and the code refactored accordingly to not necessarily use structure types to look up the data.<p>3. Conversely, are Vector2 and Vector3 complex classes with special constructors (or equally important, <i>could they someday become that way</i>)?  If so, even a &quot;fixed&quot; memory-allocation solution will be equally fragile to maintain because there is a responsibility to ensure that constructors are called correctly.<p>4. What is the memory profile of the rest of the application, e.g. how many Mesh objects themselves are created and <i>is the entire approach to managing Mesh objects wrong</i>?  Maybe the focus on optimizing one piece has missed an entire problem somewhere else that is more fundamental.<p>Clearly the original code has bugs but it is also only 14 lines, the fixes for the bugs are straightforward and the right solution (after other analysis) may well have been to remove the code entirely instead of doing the same thing in a different way.

I only noticed the use of void-pointer arithmetic and lack of alignment processing.<p>I would say the code doesn&#x27;t go far enough.  Instead of using `std::unique_ptr<char[]>`, it should define some kind of memory_block abstraction (using `unique_ptr` internally), where the copy constructor and `operator=` both do a byte-wise copy of the data.  Then alongside `make_contiguous`, you would have an analogous `copy_contiguous`, where the base case of `make_contiguous_helper` would instead call `memory_block.resize(total_size)` and the base case of `copy_contiguous_helper` would call memory_block = other_memory_block. This would remove the boiler-plate code for the copy constructor in Mesh, which can instead be:<p><pre><code>    Mesh::Mesh(const Mesh& other)\n      : memory_block(copy_contiguous(other.memory_block,\n                                     positions, other.positions,\n                                     indices, other.indices,\n                                     vertices, other.vertices))\n    {\n    }\n</code></pre>\nand similar for `operator=`.",1442236920

A person using extremely expensive equipment that is owned by an institution cannot value it within their individual budget, even though it has a &quot;price.&quot; The cost of access is the membership in that institution, which is not the same and may be priced in terms of service hours or political weight.<p>As our economy hits more extremes of abundance vs. scarcity, decoupling of value mechanisms is a likely future step. Mainstream economic theory already has some accomodations for types of goods and externalities - it&#x27;s not too radical to imagine a theory that recontextualizes them.",1442236459

They all rely on &quot;economics&quot; in the sense that they are quantifying and describing the dynamics of economic activity. Thoughtful libertarians know that these measures and models are representations of reality, not reality.<p>In fact, a fairly important figure in &quot;neoliberal&quot; thought is Hayek. Hayek (and Hayekians) argue that not only is the economy difficult to quantify and describe formally, it is impossible.

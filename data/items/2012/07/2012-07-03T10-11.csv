In other words, it refuses to enforce a libel judgement if that judgement could not have been made under US law.<p>Meanwhile, the extradition at issue here boils down to a treaty which permits extradition if the alleged act would be a crime in the UK.",1341313156

By default, DNS system doesn't support failover because multiple A records will result in round robin. So there are two possible solutions: 1. Use a DNS with health checking so that records can be changed dynamically for failover. 2. Use Anycast for load balances to broadcast only healthy nodes with the same IP prefix.

4193482,comment,4192133,4192133,36,0,grey-area,,,"The problem here is not one of competence or failure to think through implications. Facebook know exactly what they are doing, and you can be sure the potential implications of these changes were debated at length within the company at a high level. They were taken precisely because of their implications for non-technical users, not in spite of them - FB has replaced users contact details because they want Facebook to be the only way most people can contact others online.<p>Facebook have always wanted to replace the internet entirely with a system they control. Hence the walled garden approach with incessant prompts to signup to view content, the use of address book import to spread virally, the use of beacon to track and announce users activities, the use of like button js to track activity, the launch of Facebook apps and single sign-on to attempt to corral web developers within their ecosystem and make them dependent, the launch of a competitor to email/IM etc etc.<p>This latest move with email is simply the latest in a long line of moves consistently attempting to steer users into spending all of their online time within the confines of Facebook, it is entirely consistent with their past behaviour and we should expect similar moves in future.<p>So the arguments about how they could have done this differently, or whether Facebook has made some mistakes here are largely irrelevant - they will always push to own your data, email, photos, and digital life, because it's in their DNA, this is not a mistake, it's a pattern of behaviour - they can and will control your digital life if you choose to hand it over to them. Consider the quote from FB on the way their FB email works:<p><i>Regarding the ""email loss"" this may actually just be confusion around the Messages Inbox: By default, messages from friends or friends of friends go into your Inbox. Everything else goes to your Other folder.</i><p>All messages which do not come from FB contacts go into a folder which is effectively a junk folder - they want you to use their email for everything (hence the recent changes), they want your address book to contain nothing but FB contacts, they want you to forget email even existed, and they want you to encourage your friends to join FB so that you actually receive their messages. That won't work for all their users of course, but their hope is that they keep enough of the user base on board that they can dominate the internet and replace email with FB and the web with a network of sites where they control login and user info and all roads lead to FB.<p>So replacing email with FB mail wherever they can, hiding other contacts and trashing user address books is not a mistake, it's part of a broader strategy, one which is not in the best interests of their users, but which they hope most will go along with anyway.",1341313110

The very question is <i>absolutely</i> predicated on this; the question has no point otherwise. Answering it at all risks accepting the (invalid, IMO) premise.<p>Rather than say we are slaves except for those things we are permitted to do (and those permitted things need justification), we should be free except for those things we are not permitted to do (and those proscribed things need justification).<p>I think an oppressive state is the only reasonable implementation of the former.

4193474,comment,4193029,4193326,3,0,rdl,,,"It's undeniable that the added complexity of AWS makes it harder to predict how it will behave in any specific failure condition, which is one of the basic things you want to work out when designing it.  ""Traditional"" infrastructure is hard enough (especially networking), and still fails in unique ways, and we've had 10-100 years to characterize it.<p>Having a common provisioning API in a bunch of physically diverse centers IS a huge advantage for availability, cost, etc, though.  If you have 100 hours to set up a system, and $10k/mo, you have two real choices:<p>1) Dedicated/conventional servers: Burn 10 hours of sales and contract negotiation, vendor selection, etc., plus ~10-20h in anything specific to the vendor, and then set up systems.  Get a bunch of dedicated boxes (coloing your own gear may be better at scale but 10-20x the time and then upfront cost...), set up single-site HA (hardware or software load balancer, A+B power, dual line cord servers for at least databases, etc.<p>2) Set up AWS.  Since the lowest tiers are free, it's possible you have a lot of experience with it already.  1h to buy the product, extra time to script to the APIs, be able to be dynamic.  You could probably be resilient against single-AZ failure in 100h with $10k/mo, although doing multi-region (due to DB issues and minimum spend per region) might be borderline.<p>In case #1, you're protected against a bunch of problems, but not against a plane hitting the building, someone hitting EPO by accident, etc.  In case #2, you should be resilient against any single physical facility problem, but are exposed to novel software risk.<p>The best solution would be #3 -- some consistent API to order more conventional infrastructure in AWS-like timeframes.  Arguably OpenStack or other systems could offer this (using real SANs instead of EBS, real hw load balancers in place of ELB, ...), and you could presumably do some kind of dedicated host provisioning using the same kind of APIs you use for VM provisioning (big hosting companies have done this with PXE for years; someone like Softlayer can provision a system in ~30 minutes on bare metal).  Use virtualization when it makes sense, and bare metal at other times (the big Amazon Compute instances are pretty close) -- although the virtualization layer doesn't seem to be the real weakness, but rather all the other services like ELB/EBS, RDS, etc.)<p>Basically, IaaS by a provider who recognizes software, and especially big complex interconnected systems, is really hard, and is willing to sacrifice some technical impressiveness and peak efficiency for reliability and easy characterization of failure modes.",1341312854

Now suppose friend Y also demands twenty dollars, and accuses me of violating my offer when I refuse it<p>That's a false analogy. The government has a different responsibility to it's citizens than you would have to two of your friends. You are free to treat your friend differently based on any arbitrary criteria you choose...it's a relationship that is an extremely poor model for understanding how government works. The fact that you would bring something like that up, does not bode well for your argument that your ability to reason is intact.<p>The Government has a responsibility to treat all of it's citizens exactly the same. If it treats one group differently it has to have some pretty solid reasons. In the United States, the ""default action"" is that you are free to pursue your life as you wish unless the state has a compelling reason to stop you...furthermore if the Government extends some privilege to some ALL must have the opportunity to pursue it, if only in theory.<p>> There is nothing to take away; gay rights activists are not just asking to be left alone<p>This is extremely specious reasoning. By that rationale many atrocities of history are justified...the slaves wanted us to expand our definition of ""human"" and ""free man"".<p>> Furthermore, no punishment is made due to ""brain chemistry""; we are not testing individuals and discarding them based on the presence of certain biological markers (either externally or internally visible)<p>This is  based on an extremely dubious and narrow definition of ""punishment"".<p>> We are simply choosing that we do not want to incentivize, endorse, or equalize permanent homosexual coupling as we do with permanent heterosexual coupling.<p>Yes precisely. Except the government can't just randomly decide to ""incentivize"" one life style over another for no particular reason. We ""incentiveize"" a murder-free life style because it's necessary to have a functioning society.<p>There's absolutely no evidence that homosexuality is harmful to individuals or society at large. There's no reason to <i></i>actively<i></i> discriminate against it, which is what is going on.<p>At some point in time, some group of people sat down and decided marriage was between a man and a woman...that was an act of actively discriminating against another group of people. It's natural that it takes an action to rectify it....just as slavery couldn't be stopped by all the white people suddenly deciding to be nice to black people.<p>The sorry state of marriage rights in this country exists only by virtue of how indifferent and ignorant the general population is. The good news is that just as we look back in horror at the times we burned people at the stake, the people of the future will look back at the time we finally started to respect people's personal lifestyle choices.

4193430,comment,4193230,4193320,4,0,ubernostrum,,,"There are several levels of traps here.<p>One is a form of magical thinking -- the idea that ""on the internet"" should grant some sort of mystical immunity from jurisdiction. There's a fairly large body of pretty well-settled laws and treaties for deciding whether a country has jurisdiction for potentially-criminal actions that cross national borders, and for deciding whether to extradite to that country. That's exactly what's applying here.<p>Another is <i>wishful</i> thinking: wanting a system that extradites for things HN thinks should be crimes, but doesn't extradite for things that HN thinks shouldn't be crimes. The plain and simple fact is that it doesn't work that way; we can wish that the laws regarding, say, copyright were other than they are, but wishing won't make it so. Only <i>actual changes to the laws</i> will make it so, and extradition treaties are not the laws that would need changing.<p>Finally, there's the trap of assuming that this sort of thing -- a vengeful, powerful figure abusing the most convenient jurisdiction to punish someone -- is somehow new, or is unique to the US. Libel tourism is a relevant example here, since the UK is often a very friendly venue for those who seek legal revenge on critics/dissenters. It also ties in quite nicely with the second point above, because it has resulted in other countries actually changing their legal systems to bar enforcement of UK libel judgements.",1341312021

You're generally not allowed to run backup generators 24x7 in most areas.<p>It's different if you're in the middle of nowhere, but even then, maintenance issues would be prohibitive.<p>(It would be so much fun to build a big datacenter next to a hydro dam; you'd get both pretty high availability hydro power and the HV feed going to civilization could be used in reverse to bring power if the dam goes down; pick a site where the power goes off in two directions to two grids and you've got 2 grid feeds plus local hydro plus anything like diesel onsite backup.  Then you just have issues with getting diverse fiber in, but maybe along the HV routes.  Northern Oregon/Southern WA is essentially this -- which is why Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and more are putting huge facilities there.)<p>As an aside, you need to test your generators with actual load.  AC is a little more complex than just ""on or off"", too.  The ""real"" way to do this is to do periodic tests with a load bank (basically a huge resistive load which converts the electricity from the generators into heat, although if you were smart, you could get big pumps and pump a pond instead, which could be used for something useful later).  Most people don't, they just spin it up, or sometimes they use facility loads for test, which is good in some ways, but if the test fails, the facility load drops, which makes people sad.  Backup power can fail in all kinds of exciting ways other than just not delivering power, so it's possible you'll switch to generator, generator will fail, and you won't be able to switch back, or in some cases, generator will kill your UPS and drop your load.  The bigger the system the easier it seems to be for really weird things to happen, but the more individual sets of equipment you have, the higher the chances that at least one will fail in some crazy way.

One hour of <i>flow</i> is but the climax of weeks of pondering, small tests and trials, and general weirdness where one is zoned out of the rest of life :-P Almost like showing a video of an olympic 100 meter dash to an alien specie and calling it ""autonomous motion of bi-pedal earthlings"".<p>What you might be interested in, however, is how various programmers setup their environment for optimal hacking.<p>(fwiw, I just came back from the coffee shop where I wrote a faster lookup database for the Mindmax GeoCity IP database with CLISP and notepad, to save on laptop battery.

I'll be honest - I wouldn't hire you if I had seen that written publicly like that :(<p>I sometimes think that one of the major failings in our industry is that we toe the corporate line and never stop to think like a cracker. That's why I have my job - because I do. Some people see plain text passwords as a ""making life easier"" issue, whereas for me it is a major weakness at the core of the security chain. Throw all you like in the way but, at the end of that day, the passwords are there in clear text waiting for me to find it. It doesn't matter how many different ways I can or cant compromise a site: all I need to do is do it once...<p>And anyway, my point was less about this specific issue than about how I think you address it wrong. The hashed passwords issue is one you can dress up for a client so they think they get value for money. If they get nothing except a green tick on the ""critical errors"" page then you leave them with the feeling that they are missing something. Hashing passwords should be fixed - and we can get them to fix it. And at the same time they get something meaningful from their audit :)",1241302836

AdBlock Plus shouldn't have forced the issue by making it even more of an ""island"" war. They should have started with this kind of blog in the first place before escalating on the technical side.<p>Note that NoScript could easily change their scheme to move further into their island where AdBlock Plus would be forced to invade fully-- it's in no one's interest to escalate before diplomacy has been worked through.<p>The last thing we need is the light-smattering of gray Firefox addons (who are at worst showing some adsense ads) to be forced to push things deeper into darker areas.<p>Imagine if this was Symantec and Trend? Microsoft or Apple? Do you really want them to be fighting technically on your machine? In principle, it's just fundamentally bad for us to encourage that kind of behavior. They should use diplomacy, and shine lights in the dark areas before escalating technically.<p>Yes, NoScript reacted to the escalation fiendishly. I just don't think it was responsible on AdBlock Plus's side to escalate technically on such a minor issue when diplomacy/communication is so much better for everyone.",1241302315

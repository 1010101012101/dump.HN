7598939,comment,7595098,7598335,2,0,sparkie,,,"I suspect the parent thread was dreaming of a framework where languages with arbitrary syntax can be mixed and matched in user-defined ways.<p>Haskell isn&#x27;t necessarily that language, partly because it still requires centralized coordination of development of these &quot;extensions&quot; to ensure they&#x27;re interoperable - that is, there is only one <i>parser</i> for the language and its supported extensions, and many of them are build into the compiler rather than added as libraries, except those extensions which are done through quasi-quotation, such as with MetaHaskell, or some EDSL. Even that has it&#x27;s own problems, and you&#x27;ll have issues parsing if your quoted language happens to have delimiters which conflict with Haskell&#x27;s quasiquoting delimiters `[| |]` - producing syntax which cannot be parsed unambiguously (perhaps very rare or unlikely though).<p>Perhaps the biggest hurdle of having a modular language is that we do not understand how unambiguously parse the combination of two or more syntaxes. We only know that composition of two CFGs results in another CFG, but with no guarantee of unambiguity, and other parsers such as PEG rely on ordered choice, where the computer can&#x27;t decide which choice you really want.<p>What makes lisps great for composition of languages (or &quot;EDSLs&quot; in market speak), is that it bypasses the parsing problem by asking you to just write your language directly in terms of the syntax tree which a parser would generate - and perhaps use macros or other functions to simplify the use of that tree. Instead of a language being vocabulary+syntax, we create new vocabulary for what would be done through syntax in other languages - and we can thus refer to it unambiguously. Similar can be done in haskell too, through regular functions and quotation.<p>The parse problem is only really a problem because we&#x27;re stuck with this silly model of &quot;sequential text files&quot; to describe code, and we&#x27;re required to limit our languages such that a parser can take one of these text files and make sense of it. When we break out of this model, and use intelligent editors, we can reach the point where syntaxes can be composed arbitrarily, because we can indicate where each new syntax begins and ends. Diekmann and Tratt have demonstrated how this can be done while still appearing much like traditional text editing, which they call Language Boxes.[1][2]<p>Language Boxes only provide the means to compose syntaxes, but handling the semantic composition of languages is left to the authors of the languages which are being composed. Haskell is perhaps a good choice of language for providing the kind of glue needed here, where we can decide where languages can be composed based on the types returned by their parsers.<p>[1]:<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMzrTb22Ot8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMzrTb22Ot8</a>, [2]:<a href=""http://lukasdiekmann.com/pubs/diekmann_tratt__parsing_composed_grammars_with_language_boxes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lukasdiekmann.com/pubs/diekmann_tratt__parsing_compos...</a>",1397667481

This is more a coincidence of wording than a StrongLoop marketing line]<p>When StrongLoop talked at my south bay node.js meetup group, BayNode[1], at Hacker Dojo last month, they demoed Zone.js. Before demoing though, they asked if anyone in  the group had &quot;solved this&quot; to which I made it very clear that, &quot;Yes, I did about 2 years ago with trycatch[2].&quot; Their response could be summed up as, &quot;Oh?&quot;<p>Long story short, not only does my async try/catch library solve this, I can say with near certainty that it solves it in a better, more consistent, more tested, more battle proven, more performant manner. We use trycatch at LinkedIn and have not had to worry about async error handling since.<p>Additionally, adding it to any control-flow of your choice is trivial, as I have done with my stepup library[3]. Further, their main bullet-points are about enforcing the callback contract, something EVERY control-flow library should be doing, (I previously went into more detail here[4]) and the primary reason for the popularity of promises since they formalized this contract.<p>In fact, I teach these core contract rules in my monthly week-long node.js bootcamp I give here at LinkedIn[5], and the only thing they have to do with control-flow is that your control-flow library of choice should enforce them, as stepup and promises do. I do add a few rules:<p>* Function that takes 2 arguments: 1. first argument is an error, 2. second argument is the result, 3. Never pass both, 4. error should be instanceof Error<p>* Must never excecute on the same tick of the event loop<p>* Must be passed as last argument to function<p>* Return value is ignored<p>* Must not throw / must pass resulting errors<p>* Must never be called more than once<p>Long story short, domains are broken, try/catch is insufficient, use trycatch because I solved this problem over 2 years ago and have been perfecting it since.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7598983"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7598983</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/BayNode/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/BayNode/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/CrabDude/trycatch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/CrabDude/trycatch</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/CrabDude/stepup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/CrabDude/stepup</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7020054"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7020054</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/CrabDude/10907185"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/CrabDude/10907185</a>",1397667281

Consensus changes in the network? What defines documentation, or state?<p>When you say &quot;100% predictable&quot;, I think you might be discounting the fact that most services change as they run, and while they may have a finite set of operations, those operations&#x27; outcomes vary depending on input. Determinism does not work so well in network services. On top of that, most services are sufficiently complex that there does not exist enough tools to support them in a completely automated way.<p>Or, maybe I should modify my original statements to say that disposable services <i>do</i> exist, but are only useful short-lived with very specific use cases. I don&#x27;t see the point in handicapping yourself for some theoretical ideal of predicable operations. Even with unpredictable services in an undocumented state, they can be managed to work quite well in the real world and happen to run gigantic pieces of infrastructure without issue.<p>I don&#x27;t find containers to be the cheapest way to scale. The old model of just running a bunch of random apps on a single host is really cheap scaling. Containers just reduce the size and scope of the host and take process-level resource management to the host level, which has been done decades ago in the OS, but it didn&#x27;t really catch on too well.<p>In order to dynamically adjust the load on your JBOA (Just a Bunch of Applications) platform to make it as efficient as possible, you adjust the distribution of requests to your services, versus containers where you adjust the distribution of your containers. Of course it depends on whether your app stack/services is designed properly, and since they seldom are it&#x27;s not always very efficient in practice. What you consider cheap will probably change based on what kind of crap you have to manage.<p>In any case, how you use SSH is totally up to you, and it does not have to result in evilness or undocumented state.

Replace &quot;information software&quot; with &quot;web applications&quot; as you read it:<p>&quot;I suggest that the design of information software should be approached initially and primarily as a graphic design project. The foremost concern should be appearance—what and how information is presented. The designer should ask: What is relevant information? What questions will the viewer ask? What situations will she want to compare? What decision is she trying to make? How can the data be presented most effectively? How can the visual vocabulary and techniques of graphic design be employed to direct the user’s eyes to the solution? The designer must start by considering what the software looks like, because the user is using it to learn, and she learns by looking at it.&quot;<p>The act of creating a solution IS the hard part, not tweaking CSS properties or knowing how to integrate Bootstrap components just right. All those things should just get out of the way and let creatives do the important work, without bogging down in the implementation details.<p>In case you&#x27;re interested, I wrote a bit more about this on our blog a while ago: <a href=""http://blog.webflow.com/designers-will-rule-the-web"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.webflow.com/designers-will-rule-the-web</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/</a>",1397666182

The potential name space for memorable, usable, easily-typed handles is much larger than the list in the baby names book, and there is value in avoiding collisions.<p>As my own public name is two of the most common first names and one of the most common last names in the Anglophone world, I am not altogether unfamiliar with the disutility in using a common name.<p>Aside from that, in the real world, we have a host of disambiguators available to tell the difference between two individuals with similar names.  There is no particular reason why a site&#x27;s user handle would need to be unique.  The data store should probably be keying everything on a serial ID number anyway.  Just as the DNS exists to associate names with IP numbers, a handle resolver could use disambiguators as needed to minimize disruption of the user experience due to non-uniqueness.<p>If you log in from a new device with a new IP address, you might be asked &quot;Which &#x27;kathleen&#x27; are you?&quot; once, and get a small &quot;I&#x27;m a different &#x27;kathleen&#x27;&quot; link thereafter.  If you&#x27;re a giant like Facebook, there is probably more utility in allowing people to have short, non-unique user handles with an on-demand disambiguation system than in a system required to enforce user handle uniqueness.",1397665973

I&#x27;m not forcing you to write a book, nor saying you <i>absolutely should</i>.<p>My point is that if people like you, who are definitely more knowledgable than most in this area (<i>most</i> is very important here), communicate their experience, then everyone benefits. If nobody wants to write about crypto because nobody feels qualified, we&#x27;re at a dead end.<p>When a person does write content, someone somewhere will tear it apart, for pretty good reasons: getting it right is very difficult, as you say. But that&#x27;s precisely the point: to learn from our mistakes. We&#x27;re not dealing with raw science, but real life implementations of theory, and this is where things usually break, as shown by your critique. The value of the book is pedagogical, not necessarily scientific.<p>If you have anything to say about crypto (and you clearly do), then say it. We&#x27;re all the better for it! And contributions like the ones you gave here are needed. I just find the general attitude a little tiring, I&#x27;m not trying to force you into writing :)<p>Lastly, the most important thing, to me, is that I, as a chemist, can get on the internet and learn about these concepts from someone who understands them better than I do. Having a discussion about such topics is essential. Your contribution might not be in the deep theorems of academic cryptography, but they sure are appreciated by others like me.

7598747,comment,7598559,7598559,17,0,danso,,,"Let me preface this by saying: I have the upmost respect for the Webflow developers and designers...they&#x27;ve created a highly-functional web app with the purpose of enabling creators...the process to make such a full-featured web-browser product with such a range of capability is astounding.<p>That said, I disagree with the implication that Webflow, and  similar products, solve the problems of code, e.g., the phrase &quot;Do xyz without writing a line of code&quot;. Knowledge of code does constrain non-developers, but in the end, that is not the <i>hard</i> part. To use a quick example: the mechanics of baking responsiveness into a new site from scratch is significantly easier than the conceptual process of &quot;What information and features should be prominent, or excised, in the mobile view of our website?&quot;...and in my opinion, that latter problem is something that people can get into without knowing how to write code.<p>So despite the technical strength of the Webflow product, I don&#x27;t think that it makes things easier in the end. Instead of &quot;code&quot;, a newbie has to learn a whole new interface, a whole new set of iconography/terms (used for buttons, subheads, etc.), and last but not least, a whole new set of quirks inherent to the Webflow program. And when they become experts at this, they have spent 50-90% of their cognitive ability mastering Webflow, and the remainder understanding the creative and technical process of web development.<p>At some point, isn&#x27;t it just better to learn <i>some</i> code? Not 10 years worth, but something in between that and &quot;0 lines of code&quot;. I&#x27;ve used Webflow, and I&#x27;ll repeat again, it is an excellent web product in execution and design...but the problem it attempts to tackle is just too <i>big</i>, and the abstractions it offers may ended up hindering creators in the medium-to-long run.",1397665824

However, the objective of my idea needs to be satisfied, so I am absolutely continuing to work on the idea with a bit more urgency now that I won&#x27;t have YC guidance and connections.<p>My project is <a href=""http://www.MyAdversity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.MyAdversity.com</a> - A mock-up of how my profile would look is at <a href=""http://www.MyAdversity.com/profile.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.MyAdversity.com/profile.htm</a><p>The idea is to have a central hub where employers with available positions and applicants looking for a job connect. Unlike current (and highly successful) services that attempt this while obeying the status quo of hiring, MyAdversity will provide two huge and beneficial differences:<p>(1) Employers will hire the best person for the job far more successfully. Applicant profiles will already be screened and sorted. So an employer simply has to search for qualities and skills they&#x27;re looking for in an applicant, and a ranked list of applicants will appear with the best match first. An applicant&#x27;s profile will provide the employer with most information that is sought by a conventional interview. Therefore, employers will be able to focus their time on conducting a better interview that likely includes a sample of real work the applicant would be assigned if hired.<p>(2) Applicants will have a level playing field when pursuing a position they really want. The screening process does not depend on the inaccurate filters employers use today to save time, nor does it weigh so heavily on pedigree. Applicants will be judged by who they are, what they&#x27;re passionate about, and what they&#x27;re capable of. Applicants should have hope that if they acquire the skills to competently perform the work at their dream job, that they have a reasonable chance to be hired.<p>Even though it&#x27;s only an fleshed out idea with a first iteration mock-up while I code the actual MVP for beta, I&#x27;m not in stealth mode. If anyone steals the idea and executes it better than I will, then the objective will be satisfied, and I&#x27;ll be grateful. That is my main goal. I greatly appreciate any feedback you may have. Congrats to all of the groups who were chosen for an interview, and best of luck!",1397665505

Silicon Valley prices but with god-awful weather. (Look here <a href=""http://weather-explorer.com/compare?USAF=745090&WBAN=23244&USAF2=724030&WBAN2=93738&period=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weather-explorer.com/compare?USAF=745090&WBAN=23244&U...</a>) \nThe house price to median annual income exceeds a factor of 5 in any neighborhood without an hour plus commute.<p>The coolest place to live is DC, but it has an AWFUL, CORRUPT, INCOMPETENT city government and horrifically bad public schools.  Violent crime is a problem too, but the residents don&#x27;t like to admit it.  My good friend was shot in the back walking through his neighborhood. He didn&#x27;t die, so it didn&#x27;t even make the news.  The police, naturally, never caught the perpetrator.  He is currently walking around DC and likely feeling very empowered to commit more violence.  My other buddy has been mugged 3 times at gunpoint.  He moved to Maryland.  My brother&#x27;s wife was punched in the face and had her purse snatched.  As she lay on the ground sobbing, the local racist asshole kids crowded around her laughing and calling her a &quot;stupid white bitch.&quot; She had a broken jaw and it took 15 minutes for someone to actually help.  This was the &quot;up and coming&quot; neighborhood of Columbia Heights.<p>The suburbs here are AWFUL.  Overpriced, congested on all days, even weekends.  The culture in the suburbs is not like in other places I&#x27;ve lived.  Unlike in the city of DC, the people in the suburbs here are rude and keep to themselves.  Its a notoriously hard place to meet people.  Perhaps they are all angry and miserable because of the traffic, which is horrific.  Expect an hour plus commute each way.<p>Or you can take the Metro.  The Metro is awesome, until you factor in the fact that the union here prioritizes employees benefits and pay over the integrity of the system.  I won&#x27;t even go into how this contributes to the decay of the infrastructure, but trust me when I say that if you bring a person in a wheelchair to DC, do not count on any elevator at the metro stations actually being operational.  Also, expect significant delays one day out of 5.<p>Your developers will be constantly being tempted with high-paying job offers by government consulting gigs.  Due to the extremely high cost of living, they might take it.  The fact that these jobs are awful, mind-numbing bullshit with strict 9 to 5 schedules doesn&#x27;t mean anything when they have a kid on the way and can&#x27;t afford the rent in Arlington.<p>That being said, I do love the tech community here. It is my refuge. The only downfall is you run into a lot of so-called developers who are just .NET recipe corporate drones who can&#x27;t do FizzBuzz when you interview them. But then you meet the brilliant amazing but bored kid leaving a consulting firm.... and all is salvaged.... But I can&#x27;t handle the rest of it.  I&#x27;m done.<p>Fuck DC.",1397665249

7598674,comment,7597090,7597090,15,0,abruzzi,,,"Once upon a time, when I was younger, I felt very strongly that I needed a computer with everything replaceable.  I wanted to replace a CPU when it got too slow, new graphics card, upgradable RAM, storage, etc.  But I found that in the end while I&#x27;d make small upgrades, I still replaced my computers at close to the same rate.  That because some standard that was built into the old machine was no longer fast enough or wide enough for newer uses, or an interconnect standard changed (think ISA, to PCI, to PCI-X, to PCI-e)  The other reason is while i could upgrade some parts, I couldn&#x27;t upgrade all the parts, and pretty soon those parts were now two or three years old.  They were no longer as reliable as a brand new system.<p>I wonder with these modular phone ideas, if we&#x27;re looking at the beige box PC industry all over?  And whether it will be a good fit to mobile or whether you&#x27;ll buy your modular system in a year, and then find in another two years that there is a new modular interconnect version without backwards compatibility, and gradually you won&#x27;t be able to find modules that work with your current frame, so you have to replace that, and maybe the some of your old modules don&#x27;t work with the new frame, so you have to replace them at the same time.  Like a lot of beige bok PC geek, you&#x27;ll end up with a drawer of old modules in a drawer that you hardly ever find a need for, but you cant bring yourself to throw them away unless they&#x27;re actually broke.  The smart person will just buy all new modules when they replace the frame (that what most people did when they replaced their beige box, because why upgrade but still carry over that old junky graphics card).  Pretty soon your at a point where the primary benefit of modularity in not upgrading pieces, but the ability to spec exactly the phone you want when buying.  But in reality there are a lot of phones on the market now, and you can come pretty close.<p>I don&#x27;t know that this will be the case, but its how I&#x27;d bet it would end up playing out.",1397665159

You&#x27;re insuring that the maximum you&#x27;ll pay for coffee every month is $45.  If you think of it that way, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal, and doesn&#x27;t come with a ton of friction (you&#x27;re more than likely already carrying a smart phone).  Now you certainly could pay less than $45/month on coffee with coupons, but this takes away the hassle from both the consumer and from the coffee shop.<p>I&#x27;m curious if the discount being offered to individual coffee shops is negotiated or if it&#x27;s a flat rate.  I would imagine that each shop charges different amounts for a cup of coffee, although maybe it falls around some uniform distribution.  Certain locations probably skew one way or the other though;  does a cup of coffee cost more or less in midtown or the financial district than SoHo?",1397664829

Currently the full command that gets added to the crontab is something like `/bin/bash -l -c &#x27;minicron run ls&#x27;`, I use /bin/bash -l so it&#x27;s easier to get working when you are using something like rvm for managing ruby versions. The command then gets run by minicron in a pseudo terminal so I can capture output line by line or even character by character and send it on.<p>At the moment the hub only knows about jobs which you create via it or for when you first run a job it gets created, so if you ran `minicron run ls` manually from server1 a job called ls on server1 would be stored in the db. Currently there is a potential for them to get out of sync yes, I had some ideas about how a push/pull type sync feature could work but I ran out of time to work on it. It&#x27;s definitely something I want to improve in the future though!<p>Yeah, so the hub knows about any &#x27;schedules&#x27; i.e cron expressions that you set up from it, so if you set up a schedule of &#x27;* * * * *&#x27; i.e every minute and that cron doesn&#x27;t execute every minute it will send an alert via email/sms/pagerduty if you have enabled them. It does this by polling the database for executions in the background. I&#x27;m sure a way to expose those alerts to Nagios could be added.<p>I hadn&#x27;t heard of rcron, I will have to look into that.<p>Yes and I agree!

For 5% to compensate you for your sacrifice in this scenario, the company would need to be worth $900,000.<p>One of the problems employees face in Silicon Valley is that the valuations on angel and venture-backed startups are exorbitant, so the equity is overpriced.

The material we found was sufficient for us to recreate the private key and impersonate the server.<p>As you may know, OpenVPN has an SSL/TLS mode where certificates are used for authentication. OpenVPN multiplexes the SSL/TLS session used for authentication and key exchange with the actual encrypted tunnel data stream. The default TLS library for OpenVPN is OpenSSL. Since OpenVPN uses the OpenSSL library but merely passes through the TLS traffic to OpenSSL, this means that OpenVPN is exploitable using Heartbleed, in theory. However, until now there hasn&#x27;t been any solid evidence that private key material can be extracted from OpenVPN just like it has from some web servers.<p>This was the server setup we used:\nUbuntu 12.04 (VM using KVM)\nOpenVPN 2.2.1\nOpenSSL 1.0.1-4ubuntu5.11<p>Our exploit is decently weaponized, and while the code is an abomination that even Eris would be embarrassed to present, we believe it may severely impact those who have not already upgraded. Therefore, we will not be publishing the code. Nevertheless, you should assume that other teams with more nefarious purposes have already created weaponized exploits for OpenVPN. Just to be clear, we don&#x27;t intend to use this exploit ourselves. We merely developed it to examine the practical impact on OpenVPN as part of our incident investigation.<p>To our knowledge there is currently one published proof of concept script that checks an OpenVPN server&#x27;s vulnerability to Heartbleed.<p>Private questions that are not requests for the exploit can be emailed to stromberg@insto.org or admin@mullvad.net (PGP: 0x2C62E8AE).<p>Best regards,<p>Fredrik Strömberg, Co-founder of Mullvad<p>(edit: Formatting, because I&#x27;m a HN noob.)\n(edit[?]: Giving up on the formatting.)",1397664558

In DC, a small drip coffee or pour over runs around $1.80 or so. It&#x27;s $85 a month for the plan that includes lattes and other more expensive espresso drinks.<p>A small latte usually runs around $3 or so. An espresso might be $2.25-2.50. Two small lattes a day (not a lot of caffeine) would save you a ton of money a month with this plan.<p>If you drank even one cup of coffee a day, you&#x27;d save money with this, with either plan. A lot of people drink a cup in the morning and the afternoon, and that&#x27;s where the savings really add up.<p>I&#x27;d personally be more interested in a hybrid plan that got me unlimited black coffee and a certain amount of espresso drinks a month. I know they have a more expensive plan with  espresso drinks, but I don&#x27;t want that daily. How about a $65 plan?<p>It&#x27;s a great idea though. If you live and work in an area with coffee shops supported by this, you can basically have a monthly fee that covers all of your coffee needs. You can also no longer worry about having any coffee equipment in your apartment. Saving space is important to city dwellers.<p>If this came to DC, I&#x27;d strongly consider signing up for it. It&#x27;s a great way to encourage people to go to non-chains, and to make paying at non-chains easier. Many of the big chains, including Starbucks, have long had ways to pay for drinks with an app. That&#x27;s part of what this product does, and why small coffee shops would want to get on board.",1397664162
7598579,comment,7595440,7597481,1,0,bpeebles,,,"I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s two types of &quot;intentional&quot; complexity. There&#x27;s the complexity that comes about because we feel like some actions should receive preferred tax treatment over others. So, tax expenditures like student loan and mortgage interest deductions and so on. They had some complexity because &quot;we&quot;, as a government, decide to do that.<p>But the darker side is the complexity that exists to let people with enough income and the means to obfuscate their true tax rate. We may have a top marginal rate of 39.6%, but even people who have a huge income pay nothing close to that. And it&#x27;s in high income people&#x27;s interest to keep it that way. It&#x27;s <i>also</i> in the interest of the companies we&#x27;re talking about to keep the tax code complex both because they&#x27;re run by high income people <i>and</i> if the general population has a sense that the tax code is super complex for themselves, they&#x27;re more likely to use tax preparers even if they actually have very simple taxes or just mildly complex.<p>So, yes, with a huge economy the tax code is going to be very complex. That&#x27;s just politics and the nature of the beast, but there&#x27;s <i>more</i> complexity than there needs to be because of interests who drive it to complexity for their deadweight gain and strive to keep it complex.",1397664149

So, I used the inflation calculator at <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm</a>, and then I plotted electricity prices from 1990 to 2012.<p>See, this is the problem with data. &quot;Lies, damn lies and statistics.&quot; The period from 1990 to 2000 can&#x27;t help you because electrical consumption significantly increased over that period.[1] From 2000 to 2012 you take an upward sloping graph and try to flatten it by adjusting for inflation. The problem is, it still shows an inflation-adjusted increase of ~10% from 2000 to 2012, and over the same period the inflation-adjusted median income was on the decline.[2] And that&#x27;s before you account for the loss of personal wealth resulting from the dotcom bust, 9/11, the housing market crash and the consequent lack of credit availability. And even then, all you can say is that electrical consumption failed to increase significantly. There is no reduction over time, the number of MWh generated even increased slightly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.davemanuel.com/median-household-income.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davemanuel.com/median-household-income.php</a><p>> after thinking about it a bit, I think residential electricity usage for lighting should be a great test case for Jevon&#x27;s Paradox.<p>> Unfortunately, although I can find current data on residential electricity usage for lighting, I haven&#x27;t been able to find any historic figures.<p>Test cases are meaningless anyway.

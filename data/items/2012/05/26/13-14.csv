Generate a user friendly coding and transmission protocols that would make sharing data between users simple and secure<p>d. Make cyber space a congenial and secure environment without the threats of being hacked and bruised.<p>It is time that Internet privacy is protected and cyberspace made a congenial and secure environment for anyone to transact their business asserted Mr. Beracah John Martyn, Marketing Director for Owtsar Technologies. We have conceived this system putting into use the enormous experience we have gained through the year in developing good encryption protocols, sharing methods and office utilities. Combining all of them together we have put Makaseh in place.<p>Social networking, chats, sharing documents, files, online businesses, even placing information on the web for users without being harassed by manipulative SEOs are the features that will be available free to all users.<p>The enterprise version with corporate emails, documents and file sharing and management will be offered for a small fee.

Even if gold isn't useful as a medium of exchange, gold is still useful and has value because it has practical applications due to its high conductivity and corrosion resistance.  Although gold's value is highly inflated due to speculation, gold still has a ""minimum value"" due to its utility in the area of electronics.  If everyone one day decided ""gold investment is stupid"" and began dumping it, there would still be demand for gold due to the electronics market.  Ditto for silver and platinum.  These metals have value because you can <i>do</i> things with them.  There will always be demand for these things, just as there will always be demand for iron, copper, and other non-precious metals.<p>Bitcoin is like currency in that it only has value because a group of people have collectively decided that it has value.

This site has a decidedly strong bias towards do-it-yourself, but to me, the point of an internship is to acquaint yourself with people who are a few years further down their career path than you. They've been in your shoes and can help guide you. Try to figure out which boss or coworker will be a better mentor.

These are fundamental problems that you get when you gather humans into groups and knowing how to beat them is critical. In a big company you can see them all while a small company hides them better out of necessity.<p>One other thing to consider is that because big companies are able to take bigger risks they are a good place to get a jump in responsibility early.

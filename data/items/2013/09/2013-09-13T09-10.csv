Unless you believe that years of TV and radio had no impact, then clearly an impression has value.<p>The difficulty is that valuing that impression accurately and linking it to outcomes is hard, while linking clicks to outcomes is much easier.

Hater: It&#x27;s fast and easy because it doesn&#x27;t check if it&#x27;s written data correctly, which leads to corrupt data.
Lover: Well you could always turn on the write lock.
Hater: If you turn on the write lock, it becomes slower than normal SQL databases.
Lover: Well you&#x27;re just trying to use it the same way you use SQL. MongoDB is great for some problems and not so great for other problems.
Hater: What problems is MongoDB better at solving?<p>And then that&#x27;s the end. I&#x27;ve never heard a convincing use case for this thing. If you can change that for me and give me one, I&#x27;d be delighted to listen.",1379064563

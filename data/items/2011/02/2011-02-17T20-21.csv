""Fiber on mag-safe power port"" can eliminate (doesn't have to) the Ethernet port and adds _any_ future ports that can be multiplexed into fiber's bandwidth.  PoE on the other hand can't eliminate the power port due to:<p>1. PoE devices are not common.<p>2. Ethernet port will never be as ubiquitous as the power socket.<p>3. PoE 2009 is rated 51W max, macbook adapters are rated 60-80W (45W for Air).<p>4. Say future PoE comes out with 110W rating, Apple can't and won't trust all vendors to follow the standard to eliminate something as important as the power source.<p>If the PoE does not eliminate the power port, it adds nothing to existing macbooks.",1297976362

One, returns on safe investments like bank savings accounts are basically zero. Two, there's a lot of great free info on the web now for people to self-educate especially regarding entrepreneurship and angel investment, as well as more tools like AngelList and more social event series like Meetups and code jams and contests that help facilitate bring people together and leading to new enterprises and deals. Third, the top 10% wealth-wise have even more discretionary money now than they did in the 90's, and that combined with an increasing sense that the US salaryman has no guaranteed future anymore, so we we have to increasingly look to making FU/retirement from entrepreneurship and investments rather than doing the 9-to-5-til-yer-60 thing.",1297975090

Citizens of a society need to be able to speak candidly without fear of reprisal. That's just the way it is because power attracts the corrupt and the corrupt will use their power to silence dissent. Egypt could not figure out all of who was posting things against the government, so they just shut down the whole internet to try to stop anonymous speech. In the US there seems to be more control of networks and Palintir is a defense contractor that sells software to figure out who is talking to who and what their real identity is. I am sure Palintir will be making lots of sales to governments right now that don't want to see the middle east revolutions that are occurring right now happen in their own tyrannical dictatorships and corporatocracies.<p>The HBGary scandal involves multiple companies, not just the token one (HBGary) which has been ""thrown under the bus"" as a sacrifice and distraction. This is going on right now in other companies as well, so punishing HBGary doesn't slay the dragon.<p>Corporations and governments are gaming the anonymous free speech system by astroturfing, persona management, sock puppetry etc. There are armies of people posting fake opinions in an effort to manipulate public opinion and steer it towards agendas which are not sincerely held by the people posting them. They are posting only because it is their job and they are being paid. This activity is very destructive to democracy because it alters things from being the true will of the people. It is tantamount to election tampering.<p>It is critical that the public develop a response to this in the form of tools for identifying this activity.<p>One excellent tool is Anonymous's randomly discovering and the publishing incriminating emails. This activity is beneficial to democracy. However, its success is highly dependent on random chance and luck. It is also very illegal. Right now law enforcement is doing everything they can to track down the people who uncovered the wide spread and insidious wrongdoing. Punish the whistleblower is probably not going away.<p>The public also needs tools which are legal to use.<p>There are efforts right now to ""build a new internet"" that preserves anonymity and thus free speech. That is good but more is necessary.<p>Another thing which is needed is for Palintir-like systems which can peek behind the scenes, uncover connections between posts, patterns of posting and patterns of speech,  to be written and open sourced. These systems can be used to identify sock puppets. They can also be used as a weapon to unmask the anonymous and attack free speech, but they are already being done to do that.

But I still think the truth is that today's monetary situation is creating an incentive to chase yields, and it is not out of the question that this is showing up in VC valuations just as it is showing up in commodities.<p>The fact that these valuations seem to be stemming more from the money others have put in (or said they would be willing to put in) <i>rather than the revenue of the company itself</i> ought to arouse deep suspicion.  Yes, I understand part of a valuation is examining the pricing signals being sent by the market, in this case VCs, for the particular company.  Still, look at Twitter.  Some valuations for it have come in at $10 billion when it's been admitted their yearly revenue is $150 million.  If Twitter were to IPO at that valuation, that means 99% (+/- for whatever other assets they might have) of their float would be <i>pure leverage.</i>  For many other tech start ups, the same sort of situation exists even if the magnitude is not as great.<p>For those down the line in the thread talking about the better development tools/programming languages/hardware in relation to this topic, let me ask: <i>how do better development tools justify higher valuations?</i>  Certainly, I'd rather be developing a web app with Python/Django today than in ASP in 1995, and running it on today's server hardware with today's replication and load balancing strategies.  There's no doubt the development cycle for many kinds of applications has been radically shortened.  Yet, the revenue model for many of these internet companies is only slightly clearer than it was in 1998.  That is not true of every company, only some; but it is true of enough that I think it is cause for concern.<p>Experimentation is a wonderful thing.  It is the only way the economy advances and people's lives become better.  Part of the ""startup industry""'s job is to provide that experimentation, and by its very nature most will fail.  The problem is when the investment community begins to pay a large speculative premium for that.

I'm posting this under a new account, because I have co-workers that also read HN and know my main alias.<p>Over the past week and a half, I have been interviewing with a company that I really want to work for. I'm currently working in TX, and the company I am interviewing for is a startup out in SF. It has been a dream / goal of mine to end up out there for the past 2 years, or so.<p>Well, things move fast at startups, and I have conducted 2 phone interviews and now they want to fly me out there on Monday to meet everyone (and, make a job offer I am assuming / hoping). The only problem is, at my current job I am supposed to demo some software we have been writing for the past few months to one of our clients who are flying in to see it. My current company consists of 7 people, and we do minor software development for auditors. Not exactly an enjoyable setup. The company I'm interviewing with is well established, so I'm not concerned about it being a potential job security risk. I guess it may technically no longer even be considered a startup.<p>All of this is happening very fast, and I feel like I'm just needing some advice because I'm not sure if what I'm about to do is the right decision.<p>I'm going to go through with the flight on Monday, and go out there. I'm just going to go for it. I don't want to do anything to delay this process and put any halt to the momentum that I have built up with them. I want this new job way too much.<p>Job offer or not, though, this would probably mean I'd have to resign from my current job, since I'd be shrugging off a meeting that has been schedule for a little more than a week.<p>I've got a phone call coming up in a few hours with the startup I'm interviewing with to discuss flight arrangements and schedule, etc.<p>Does this sound like a bad plan?",1297973289

Profit and sustainability were things that would simply happen as if by magic; the idea was to get a company out there, spend a lot of VC money marketing and building, and the rest would fall into place (as immortalized on South Park by ""Collect Underpants ... ... Profit!"").<p>Certainly there are companies today that resemble that M.O. a bit -- Twitter is useful and interesting, but their business model is still a work in progress after years. Most companies today are more sensical, are smaller in size and need less cash.<p><i>it's much worse than the last one. Valuations are insane</i><p>You obviously don't remember the dot-com boom. It's not worse; today is nothing compared to the ridiculousness of that era. A scant few companies have valuations that are questionable or appear ridiculous. They may be. But most companies -- the vast majority -- are not operating on crazy valuations. Back then, every company that began with an ""i"" or an ""e"" was worth millions, automatically. Today, we have, what, about five that are overvalued? That's a ""bubble""? No, that's just exaggeration -- and a wild misunderstanding of what ""bubble"" means.",1297972913

Samsung seems to have split their software and hardware people into competing groups.<p>There's a general lack of focus or apparent belief that their core competencies should only include one (1) of hardware or software among most consumer electronics brands, it seems.

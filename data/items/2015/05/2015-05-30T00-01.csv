2. Not <i>kill</i> them, because thats barbaric and primitive. We are better than that.

Apart from the difficulty of making a living if there&#x27;s no way to get paid - and don&#x27;t go telling me you support basic income, because I can&#x27;t pay my bills your support and I&#x27;m guessing that you don&#x27;t have an action plan to redesign the economy on any sort of meaningful time horizon - I don&#x27;t want Free Art. Free art isn&#x27;t subject to any sort of quality control, and there simply aren&#x27;t enough hours in the day to spend browsing all existing art. Putting a price on things, even if it&#x27;s just a monthly Netflix subscription fee, promotes selectivity, and as an artist that&#x27;s what I care about. I want you to be emotionally engaged with the art I make in some way (even if you dislike it; there&#x27;s lots of art I dislike that I nevertheless consider to be Good Art), but if art is free then there&#x27;s no incentive have strong preferences and so no real engagement occurs.<p>Of course, you might find a piece of my art and love it. But I would much rather sell it to you and see you express your interest albeit indirectly by buying a ticket or a copy of it. Think of how you donate to charity - you give some money to an organization or in response to a particular event or to someone on the street who seems sincerely needy to you. You could just throw a $10 bill in the air on a windy day every so often and the money would likely wind up helping someone, but that wouldn&#x27;t be very rewarding for you, would it?<p>Free Art just says that art has no economic value and therefore the time spent on it doesn&#x27;t either. It says some 3 year-old&#x27;s finger paintings are no better or worse than the expression of someone&#x27;s craft that took years to develop. It says that art isn&#x27;t important enough that you should be willing to sacrifice anything to get it, and that anyone who chooses to spend their time producing it is being self-indulgent.<p>I realize this is far from what you intended, but I think that&#x27;s because you haven&#x27;t through through the ramifications. I get that you think art is great and that you&#x27;d like everyone to be able to educate, entertain and edify themselves by making it widely accessible. But you haven&#x27;t figured out how this works for people who produce art, or what signal it sends to the general public about the value of the art. Your proposal doesn&#x27;t say anything about subsidizing artists or how any such subsidy would be funded, and even if there were subsidies then you&#x27;ve put artists in the position of appealing to a few charitable gatekeepers, who are inevitably going to take it on themselves to decide what is or is not art, while simultaneously wrecking the marketplace. You wouldn&#x27;t expect a chef to come to your house and cook a meal for free, and somehow I doubt you&#x27;d expect that chef to give away all her recipes for free. Why do you think that people who labor over paintings or music or literature or _________ should be required to forgo any economic interest in their output?",1432946855

Their ideas of the world and their place in it are shaped by old assumptions about the special role and status due to men in the workplace and in the family, but they live in circumstances where those assumptions no longer apply.&quot;<p>The author says this right after explaining what these men lost to time are jobs in factories and fields.  They didn&#x27;t lose a privileged place in society, they were at the bottom being worked to death and now they don&#x27;t even have that.  But right next to this is an infographic showing the male share of new billionaires which has nothing to do with the uneducated men the article is talking about.  It only serves to help the reader keep in mind who the real victims are.  (The infographic of the male share of prisoners appears later)<p>The author tries to give a balanced picture but to me this is a great example of how feminism struggles to talk about men&#x27;s issues in a meaningful way.  The first word of the article is a woman&#x27;s name, the first statement is a woman calling men lazy.  By the end of the second paragraph the author has painted a picture of the men the article is about as lazy, gambling and unemployed.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine an article ostensibly about women&#x27;s issues that opens up with a man explaining these particular women are good for nothing and then the author trotting out various ideas of why that&#x27;s the case.<p>edit: This is just ridiculous.  The author suggests that these men need to do more housework, like maybe that&#x27;s their real problem, they just can&#x27;t get with the program because they&#x27;re clinging to pre-feminist revolution gender roles.<p>It&#x27;s almost a dangerous view, mass unemployment is an economic problem and instead of discussing it frankly the (anonymous) author would have us focus on how backwards men are now that the patriarchy isn&#x27;t showering them in privilege anymore.

Even if it was only a chunk, not only would this have helped free up debt load, it would also go directly back to the banks that had been lending to the lower 90% all along.<p>Instead they gave money to banks to help with loans/lending, overlooking the fact that it does nothing to help consumers.

Think of a robot interacting with a toddler or a bunch of kids.<p>This is monumentally harder than scanning in front of the robot with a laser to detect geometry, measure height and approach speed and then plan a jump.  Much harder.<p>Not to diminish their work but the math and physics seem almost trivial.  Figure out the x-intercept, width and height of a parabolic path that will give you enough margin of error not to touch the obstacle.  Then do the math on the time delay between the front and rear legs based on approach speed.  Then plan the gait in order to be able to have the legs at the right point at the right time.  So long as you have a robot that can jump it&#x27;s a done deal.<p>Again, I know it is more complicated than that, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the degree of sophistication a robot would have to have to manage the real world with binocular vision.  My 9 year old kid can fly remote controlled model airplanes tooling along at over 60 miles per hour just using his eyes.  You don&#x27;t need millimeter accuracy laser measurement devices, you need to understand the world around you in some context.<p>Context: I built walking robots (not toys, research grade) over 25 years ago.  Today there&#x27;s virtually no difference in actuation mechanisms and sensors.  A lot of these programs are grant-sucking machines that are reinventing the wheel rather than making true progress.  Here are some of the things we need:<p>- True binocular vision systems that can develop an understanding of the environment to various degrees of sophistication (this is hard)<p>- Better actuators. The artificial muscle has yet to be realized. Make your arm limp on the table.  You can&#x27;t do that with a robot. You can simulate it.  But it isn&#x27;t the same thing.  You&#x27;ll actually consume power and spin gears/pumps very fast to be in &quot;limp and compliant&quot; mode.  Real flexibility and real compliance are critical for robots that need to interact with people and animals.  Every animal on the planet relies on this to interact with the environment.<p>- Better programming paradigms.  We are still typing &quot;if&quot; statements and &quot;for&quot; loops to program intelligent robots. A far greater degree of abstraction is required to truly advance the art.  No, libraries are not a solution.  We need to be able to express concepts to a machine in far more efficient terms.  How do you teach a robot to tie a knot on a rope on a table and have that robot think about using that same knot on a sailboat or to restrain a dog to a post?  Without telling it that these are options?<p>- Better means of communication with machines.  Buttons and knobs isn&#x27;t how you communicate with your taxi driver or housekeeper.  A 5 year old kid should be able to command a machine without having to rock the Linux command line.<p>etc.<p>I guess my argument is that we already know how to build &quot;parlor trick&quot; machines.  We&#x27;ve known how to do this for quite some time.  Any set of decent mechanical engineers can build a decent walking machine given a reasonable amount of time.  Making it walk and even jump is almost just as trivial.<p>Because of the way these departments are funded the truly hard and interesting work might not be done or might not see the same degree of funding.  Some of the items I listed above could require 10 to 20 years of solid dedication before the &quot;Oh Wow! Did you see that!&quot; moment is reached.  Most of the funding out there isn&#x27;t smart enough to support these kinds of projects.  And so the money goes to the guy who can put a spring-loaded plunger on a little robot with wheels and show it can jump to the top of a building.  You know, first year college physics, if not high school physics.  This does virtually zero to advance robotics but it sure makes politicians write checks!",1432944762

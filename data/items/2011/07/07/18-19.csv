2739823,comment,2738541,2738541,1,0,flignats,,,"Hey - fortunately, your problems aren't actually too bad.<p>Of course, you can take my advice with a 'boulder of salt' ;)<p>1. Afraid of patent trolls?  Well, there are a few ways to get rid of this fear.  First, if your product isn't successful, no one will care if you are infringing - even patent trolls (unless you are a big company/name I am not aware of).  Second, Let's say you do become successful and a patent troll sues you and is in the right - your product is successful, be happy about that.  You'll most likely be able to come to an agreement to use the technology or be able to build your own tech around the patent at that point and stop using the patent's tech.<p>2. This is an easy one.  When do you think you will be taking on investment?  If your product is a success and you think your company will take on investment in the near term, then make it a C corp.  Why?  Because you have to be a C corp to take on a certain amount of investment and who can invest in you.  I believe it is 1mm - but I could be wrong.  Bottom line - most successful companies eventually have to become a C corp.  But, let's say your timeline is for the long-term.  You can become an S-corp and skirt some tax laws, favorably.  An S-corp automatically turns into a C corp when taking on certain investment, growing to a certain size, or falling out of their definition of an S-corp.  It's cool if you think you need the tax savings, but if not then why bother with the headache.  LLC is the easiest to setup yourself.  It gives you full control, good tax laws, and you can easily convert into a C-corp by merging it with one when you need to be labeled as such.<p>3. You incorporate your business.  Your product will go under so many evolutions, changes, iterations, that you may not even recognize it 1 year from now.<p>Try to think of it this way;  these are all technicalities at this point.  Get these out of the way so that you are not putting effort towards these resource sucking details.  Put your attention back into your product and focus on building something great!",1310065196

If you browse to /admin and find it non-password-protected, and then deliberately use it to manipulate an application or gain access to information you reasonably know you shouldn't have access to, nobody making a prosecution decision is going to care about your nerdy protestation that there was no password.<p>You will be afforded the opportunity to argue that /admin was ""intended to be public"" in court.

Perhaps its the extent to which the law behind trademarks is directly based on its purpose (protecting consumers from confusion), whereas with patents and copyrights the link between the laws involved and the social good they ostensibly promote is much less direct.<p>EDIT:  I suppose judges also are all certainly qualified to tell whether some situation is confusing, but understanding patents often requires expert knowledge and judgement that is hard to acquire.",1310064365

2739679,comment,2738392,2739223,3,0,dkarl,,,"You can write pretty fast code in Java, so on the JVM you can use Java as your low-level language.  With Python, if you want to write fast code (at least with CPython) you have to write a C extension, which requires a certain amount of effort and expertise.<p>I personally don't know anything about Haskell, but I have heard that it has a very complicated performance model.  I.e., it's hard to predict what will be fast and what will be slow, and if something is slow that seems like it ought to be fast, it can be hard to figure out how to fix it.  (Since that was one of the major complaints of Haskell users the last time I seriously considered learning Haskell, it might be fixed or mitigated by now.)<p>Scala can also be slow or unpredictable when using functional idioms, but with Scala you can always revert to Java-style programming to get Java-level performance.  The fact that you can do that for a single function or even a single inner loop in a code file that is mostly nice clean functional code is very convenient.  One thing I hated about Jython was rewriting entire classes in Java when only a little part was performance-sensitive.  Or, equally frustrating, having a Jython class whose associated ""little"" classes (performance-sensitive callbacks such as renderers) were in a completely different place in the source tree because they were implemented in Java.",1310063475

2739666,comment,2739021,2739021,1,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Good question.  You asked it, so now I don't have to!<p>The comments are good.<p>So, yes, for my startup, I'm using the Microsoft 'stack'.  But for C#, I'm not using it!  Haven't touched it!  Instead I'm using Visual Basic .NET and .NET, ADO.NET, ASP.NET, Windows Server, etc.<p>For 'training' people, my guess is that 'basic' Visual Basic .NET will prove to be super easy for nearly any reasonably talented, interested hire to learn.<p>Why?  For nearly everything I'm doing, nearly all of the the syntax and semantics of Visual Basic (the current .NET version) couldn't be easier to read and type.<p>I also like the Visual Basic compiler, just as shipped with the .NET Framework (version 4.0).  The Visual Basic compiler is right there as file VBC.EXE, and to run it just use a command line or some scripting language (I am using ObjectRexx) to type the command line.  The command line syntax is short and easy to understand.  The compiler is fast and generates remarkably small EXE files.  The error messages are from good to quite nice.  So far I've found no bugs at all.  I'm thrilled.<p>My view is that the syntax of C# is more difficult, and so far I see no reason to struggle with it.  So, for my startup, so far it's just Visual Basic and .NET.<p>For typing in software, I just use my favorite text editor KEdit with a lot of macros.  And I make heavy use of just the ordinary desktop 'windowing':  So, when typing, typically I have about 15 windows open, 'tiled' with the upper left corners running from upper right to lower left (can always see at least the top or left side of each window and can rearrange the Z-order without moving any windows).  So, I have windows with pieces of my design, software, testing, documentation, etc. all readily available.  It's nice.<p>I'm also thrilled with how ASP.NET works when I just type in Web page software with KEdit.  So, when a browser displays a page under development, if there are Visual Basic errors then get a nice page in the browser making clear what the errors are.  NICE.  When the compiler errors are gone, then at the bottom of the Web page is a NICE description of all the work ASP.NET did with a 'control tree', various ID values, some sizes in bytes, some timings in milliseconds, etc.  NICE.<p>When finally understand from 5000 feet up basically what ASP.NET is doing, then it's fairly simple and clear and okay.<p>Why I am staying with Microsoft:<p>(1) What I Knew.  I got started on that path to Microsoft and stayed on it.  So I did a lot with OS/2, and when I changed to Windows it was, of course, similar.<p>(2) Documentation.  I am finding that my code is heavily just some 'glue' to call code from Microsoft, especially their .NET.  So, I do more reading documentation than writing code.  So, I care a lot about the quality of the documentation.<p>The Microsoft .NET documentation is enormous.  I have about 2400 Web pages of Microsoft documentation on my computer, abstracted, and indexed, and I put as comments in my code the file system tree names of relevant documentation and with one keystroke KEdit will display the Web page.  Nice.<p>But that's a LOT of documentation.  Writing such documentation is EXPENSIVE.  In simple terms, the quality from Microsoft is high.  More deeply, often the writing quality of the real 'content' needs to be improved.  I'm afraid that, without the big bucks of Microsoft, alternative documentation would be worse.<p>(3) Support.  If my startup is successful, then I will want a lot of technical support.  I'll be willing and able to pay for the support.  I am hoping that going with Microsoft I will be able to get some good support.<p>So far I've gotten some surprisingly good support for free from various experts at Microsoft via various Microsoft fora.  Of course, to get a good response, tend to need to have done some good homework and actually ask a good question!  The free support is so good that I am looking forward to some nice help when I'm able to pay.<p>For Unix flavors, I'd be afraid on each of these three points.  Afraid?  Yes.  Well informed on Unix?  No!",1310063283

Halogen lights take time to warm up and their color spectrum shifts along the way. I like them, but they don't deliver a real daylight look. Any time I've ever shot at night using a HMI people's skin looks purplish unless you add in some incandescent light to warm it up. I am <i>not</i> saying that LEDs magically solve this problem, but that their limitations as stated above are really not that bad.<p><i>The problem is that people can't tune the color filtering in each of their rooms with the expertise of a Hollywood cinematographer.</i><p>It's an awful lot easier to do now. For old-style cinematography you were basically dealing with bulbs of a fixed color temperature, gels, and a dimmer switch. Building the lighting setup so that it looks good on camera was a very complex task - in fact that's one reason that the title 'cinematographer' got upgraded to DP/Director of Photography. (There's a joke: why don't more DPs smoke? Because it takes them 3 hours to light anything.)<p>Now with an LED array, you can basically just twiddle a few knobs and get the color you like. If you're shooting video it's especially easy, because you can just hold up a color card and match it against some other scene or even have a computer do the matching for you. But even with film, you can still shoot a polaroid and get the color matching done a lot faster on a small-to-medium set with LEDs. And a lot more cheaply, too, because everyone knows that LEDs are commodity components. If someone wants to do this at home with mood lighting (say, recessed strips around the ceiling with 3 tracks of red, green and blue LEDs connected to a dimmer - something that can be done for a few hundred bucks)...well, it ain't that hard.<p>As for testing, I can simply start another thread about it if the results are sufficiently interesting.",1310062486

Very roughly, maybe there's a 4/5 chance Facebook falls back to $10B, and a 1/5 chance it races forward to $310B. Voila, that risk-neutral average value is $70B.

It's in an industry that's just ripe for disruption - online payments & selling online - so I'm even more excited about that.<p>I'm young. 21. Haven't dealt with something like this before. So, I'm wondering if anyone has had experience with this and what, if anything, you did to help you deal with this?<p>I never understood the comment ""Startups are like roller-coasters"".<p>Yesterday, I was on top of the World. Hey, we're about to be the next Craigslist/PayPal/eBay/Amazon. Today, I'm significantly lower. These hurdles are getting more insane; what's the chance of us breaking through?<p>The day before, I was up. Then low. Etc.<p>Have you experienced this personally? How have you dealt with it? Is what I'm experiencing abnormal? Appreciate if you can shed any additional light on this subject.<p>Gracias.",1310061845

I'm not super familiar with GSM, but I know for CDMA the reason SMS messages have a small fixed size is they used to go out over the paging channel. I don't think that's the case any more for CDMA.  I'm kind of surprised it is for GSM.<p>In any case, the point is there's no objective way to untangle costs in an item that has a large implementation cost but provides more than one service.",1310061695

Amish practices are ultimately driven by religious belief: the technological, environmental, social, and cultural consequences are secondary. They often don't have logical reasons for their policies.<p>Of course, there is no rule that says religion cannot be logical. Regardless, he says a little later:<p>> Behind all of these variations is the Amish motivation to strengthen their communities.<p>And then he spends several paragraphs giving a logical, well reasoned account of how various technologies (cars, electricity) were rejected because of their impact on the community.<p>Second, while carefully explaining one group, the old-order Amish, he very much mischaracterizes another: the Luddites. These were not people who simply rejected all new technology; they were protestors against the social changes produced by the industrial revolution. And their protests sometimes took the form of violent destruction of textile factories. It seems they didn't want to be mere cogs in some huge corporate machine, a sentiment I think most of us can empathize with (regardless of whether we approve of their methods).",1263322669

My own experience is that in startups, it is all about trust and trust is in fact a far more important currency than even money. But trust in a startup has a different meaning than trust in everyday life. By trust, I am talking about trusting a person’s judgment and their abilities. So after you recruit them, you need to build them into a cohesive team by developing a trust among them so that when someone agrees to a schedule or proposes a budget, they are in fact doing so knowing what they are capable of delivering and understanding the consequence if they don’t.

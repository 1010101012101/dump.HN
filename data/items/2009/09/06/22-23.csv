808237,comment,807715,808219,0,0,jacquesm,,,"True, but if you do not <i>have</i> to break stuff then don't.<p>After all, it was pseudo random to begin with, nobody made any claims as to how random it was, simply that it was 'periodical' and that the period was long enough that in a short lived program you would get the impression of random data.<p>Every programmer even halfway worth his weight in bits would know that that meant that if you needed 'high grade' random data you'd best look elsewhere, something with a longer period that downsamples to 32 bits for instance, or a hardware based random generator.<p>This has been true of the 'rand' function on a unix box as well, the period is (2^(sizeof(int) x 8))-1, that's just about the only guarantee you get. (hn eats asterisks)<p>The article linked here concentrates on the lower single bit of the output of the random generator (the rand(0,1) part of the code will generate a number between 0 and 1), but in fact completely misses the point that if you want a number that is either 0 or 1 you <i>MASK</i> out the lower bit instead of asking PHP to do this using the range option, which is meant to give you a number which has been 'scaled' down from the output of the PRNG in the php core. Right now you are probably sampling the lower bit of a bunch of float operations, not the best way to get one random bit.<p>(rand() & 1) would have done the job just fine.<p>So much for programmers that can manipulate bits, even after they see the implementation they still can't figure out how to do it properly. What's so hard about a one bit and ?<p>So, first of the article uses the PRNG in a completely nonsense way, then it is labelled as 'broken' based on a broken test and next the PHP maintainers get flak for staying backwards compatible when there was no clear need for change.<p>It wasn't 'broken', it could be improved a lot at the expense of backwards compatibility and so they chose the appropriate route and added a library routine for that.<p>I'm no big fan of PHP, but this whole thread is way over the top.<p>here is the same example but with the lower bit masked instead of doing a bunch of unnecessary float ops on the output of the PRNG:<p><a href=""http://ww.com/random.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ww.com/random.php</a><p>I would say that looks quite a bit better than the provided sample.<p>And I also don't get what the $x=0; is for at the end of the loop on the x-coordinate, never knew that you had to reset your loop variables.",1252276949

808235,comment,808134,808134,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Looking at the prices for unlocked iPhones, this doesn't come as a big surprise. The 3GS is especially expensive, at around €800 for the 16GB model, and over €900 for the 32GB one. That's a <i>lot</i> for a phone, most consumers won't consciously spend that much, just hidden in the monthly fees, which have to be in a similar ballpark to other tariffs.<p>However, I suspect the ""old"" 8GB 3G model, which is around €500 these days, has been generating a tidy profit for the operators since the release of the 3GS. I wouldn't be surprised if this pattern repeated every year: the new model is the loss leader, the previous model, profitable after having come down in price, feeds off the awareness of the high end one.",1252276779

It can't be ""ugly"" and ""used too often"" at the same time, any more than an ugly house can be photographed too often.  Also, what does ""ugly"" mean?  Illegible?<p>Personally, when I'm judging how legible a font is (how easy it is to read when it's small, for example), I have to say that Comic Sans does very well.<p>Perhaps it's a polarizing design, where some people just hate it, and it's better to bore everybody than to cause that level of heartburn to those of a more sensitive persuasion.  Is that it?  If so, who are these people, exactly?  The general public, I think, really has more important things to worry about than somebodies font choice, so who are these delicate flowers that we're protecting?<p>I would just be interested in knowing where this animosity is coming from, and whether it's based on anything real, or is it like metro-sexual fashion preference, and it's only based on ""what's in""?

Paradoxically, making craigslist better looking makes it less like craigslist.

I recommended OCaml, saying that it had all the same capabilities as Fortran (high performance, portability, compiling to native code, support for similar programming style) but also had additional features that would make me more productive. OCaml's position in language design space was perfect for a project in which a functional programmer would be doing most of the work, but a client felt more comfortable with something Fortran-like, in case he ever had to maintain it himself.<p>If I were making the decision completely on my own, I would prefer Haskell, but in-between languages like OCaml can make good compromise options.

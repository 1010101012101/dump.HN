It reads like a load of over-dramatized crap.<p>Part of what's wrong with so many of these internet-marketers is that everything seems to be positioned as various degrees of ""super rockstar ninja greatness"".  There is never any bad, unmarketable, stupid ideas.  IE: no one wants to put their reputation on the line by making a potentially bad call.  So, he won't say that your proposal was disagreeable, only that other proposals were even more ""super rockstar ninja great"".<p>IMO, if he actually had something great to offer and was bowled over-amazed-stunned at just how great an idea was, he'd find a way to nurture that, not blow it off.",1229349599

CS teaches you the fundamentals of programming, but applying these fundamentals is almost a completely different field.<p>CS to software engineering is like Materials Science to Architecture - sure you'll know what the molecular structure of wood is and maybe even the exact tensile strength of a 2by4, but you won't know even the first step to designing and constructing a house.",1229349162

398305,comment,398083,398083,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"If you want to look at an interesting example of a successful independent game designer, look at ZUN, the developer of the wildly popular Touhou Project shmup series.  You'll notice a few things:<p>1.  He's stuck to a genre that, while still quite popular, <i>does not require an enormous development team</i>.  The place for gaming startups is not in the business of the ""big players"", but working on games whose main attraction is creative content and enjoyable gameplay, not high-end graphics and enormous amounts of hand-crafted content.  Because of this, ZUN can develop roughly one game a year for the most popular amateur (<i>doujin</i>) game series in Japan <i>in his spare time</i>... and still have time to work full-time at Taito corporation!  See Braid for another example of a relatively low-budget game that made it big.<p>2.  The primary attraction of his games is probably the incredibly well-made musical scores: each game has a full soundtrack, with tracks for every level and boss fight.  This serves as a ""grab"": the easiest way to get someone's attention is a case of ""that looks cool"" or ""that sounds cool.""  His games certainly do the latter.  If you can get a talented artist, music is not something that inherently takes a great deal of time to produce, unlike enormous amounts of 3D modeling or other forms of content.  Most importantly, people simply like listening to good music while playing a game: if you find people are turning off the music to play their own during a game, <i>you have done it wrong</i>.<p>3.  In the end, remember that enormous resources and marketing are not necessary to create a game.  ZUN has certainly proven this true: he has gone from making hobby games in college to being the sole developer of a game series so popular that the fanbase has its own concert, its own convention so large it rents out the Tokyo Big Sight convention center, and makes up almost 5% of Comiket.  Yet he never did any significant marketing--his fans marketed the game for him.  And he still outright refuses to sign any rights over to a major corporation for any sort of higher-budget game or non-game adaptation.<p>Now, perhaps ZUN was lucky.  Or perhaps in one of his drunken moments (he's notorious for his love of beer), he struck a goldmine of brilliance that allowed him to become so successful.  But he's certainly not unique: the way to success for a small games developer is to make niche games and acquire a dedicated fanbase, not to aim at the <i>Halo</i> market.",1229348294

Part of the huge economic growth experienced over the 20th century had to do with population growth and consolidation as the world's global superpower. Even though the rest of the world also had economic growth, other economies didn't fare so well over the same period of time.<p>In a way, looking at the past century and assuming that the next one will be similar in terms of return rates is like expecting Google's stock to grow spectacularly over the next decade.

Thorough and honest and clear and direct. They were motivating and demonstrated just how much people can do when they put their minds to it. I read every word of every application and I learned a lot.<p>If I had 60 seats, I still would have had too many people awe-inspiring applying. Unfortunately, I have nowhere near that, and so I had to make difficult, irrational and not particularly fair choices. Alas, I’m going to be unable to work with you in 2009. There are still interviews and such to go through, so I don’t have the final group selected, but I thought the fairest thing to do was let you know as soon as possible.<p>The good news, and I hope you think it’s good news, is that you don’t need me. As I said before, I have no magic wand, no secret recipe. Your decision to just make it happen, to push forward, to change... that was the hard part.<p>Go. Do that. Blow them away. I fully expect it will happen.<p>Thanks for taking the time and thanks for understanding.<p>Seth<p>PS I’m going to post on my blog about how stellar each of you are... and I’m linking to a Google listing of applications (all of them, accepted and not).

Walking normally is more expensive (in terms of time required to cover N distance) than walking on the walkway.  The question can be rephrased as, all things considered, ""would you rather spend less time on the walkway or the ground?""  You would rather spend less time on the ground, because it takes you more time to cross it.<p>Naive proof: your normal speed is 1m/s, run speed is 2m/s (can be done for 1s), walkway moves at 1m/s.  Track is: 2m of ground, 6m of walkway.<p>Running on walkway: 2s to cover ground, 1s to cover first 3 meters of walkway running, 1.5s to cover last three meters = 4.5s. \nRunning on ground: 1s to cover ground, 3s to cover walkway = 4s.<p>Look at it this way: the normal (no-run) time is 5s.  Running on the ground chops off an entire second; running off the walkway chops off only half a second.",1229346830

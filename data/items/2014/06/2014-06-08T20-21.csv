They cycle their advertised MAC addresses every 15 minutes or so (and some provide a &quot;random resolvable address&quot; which you can use to find out the physical BT MAC address after pairing for easier reconnection).<p>From my office in downtown Los Altos, I can currently see a FitBit Flex, a FitBit One and a couple of phones -- the randomized MAC address is all that prevents someone bad from tracking them (BTLE scanners/phones are cheap!).<p>I guess you could still use the 15 minute MAC to track people through a train station or other semi-public space (to gather metrics on where people are coming from and going to).

I&#x27;m a lot more worked up about the fact that these things are already fair game when it comes to private corporations. As someone who isn&#x27;t hoping for some libertarian, trans-national world order based on the internet, I&#x27;m a lot more worried about how private companies can abuse that data than how the government can do so. Yes, the government can throw me in jail and private companies can&#x27;t, but the government has little reason to want me in jail. Meanwhile, private companies have a lot of incentive to access that data and screw me over.<p>I think the libertarianness of the whole digital privacy movement is losing a lot of potential supporters.

But the decision to _try_ to eliminate the fear can only be done after identifying and confirming that the fear is indeed unwarranted and unhealthy.<p>On the other hand, if the emotion is warranted, then it&#x27;s completely valid.<p>What I&#x27;m suggesting is that human emotion serve as a really good indicator, but they cannot be taken as the absolute truth.

It&#x27;s virtually identical to the current loan landscape.<p>Example (broad strokes):<p><pre><code>  Student Grant / yr     Minimum Coverage\n              $5,000                 100%\n             $10,000                  98%\n                 ...\n             $50,000                  90%\n</code></pre>\nCouple this with removing government backed student loans for undergraduate altogether and now you&#x27;ve got a reasonable out-of-pocket maximum spend per student per year. In this table it would be $5k for a $50k school - if the school wants any gov help they have to manage their own tuition costs.<p>Obviously this would be sort of a disaster at first and these numbers are probably silly, I have no clue what the process of coming up with these numbers and adjusting them (somewhat less than 1200% over 30 years) would even look like.",1402260779

E-gads, what a mess.<p>People today have roughly the same amount of money as they did 30 years ago. <i>The cost of college education in terms of the amount of money people directly and immediately pay has not changed</i>. It&#x27;s not like we all became millionaires. What&#x27;s happened is that we switched from grants to loans, which was supposed to allocate more risk on the student and banks, then we made sure that anybody that wanted a loan could get one, so there was no immediate penalty for making a bad choice.<p>We took a trade with tremendous uncertain future returns -- which degree I should get -- made sure everybody could get whatever they wanted, then pushed any pain far out into the future. Then we piled on by making the entire scheme immune from bankruptcy, taking out any risk that creditors might face! It&#x27;s like we just kept the grants, but forced the student to pay for his own grant in terms of future debt. It&#x27;s a incredibly terrible job of policy, no doubt, but the free market has nothing to do with it. If anything, it&#x27;s a nice little experiment on how screwed up you can make a market before some kind of feedback mechanism kicks in. We took the purchaser out of the mix, then we took the lenders out. The only thing left is the political system, which seems wedded to the policies that led us here in the first place. Continuing down this road of idiocy, next up we should try to take the political system itself out of the mix. Perhaps we could have a constitutional &quot;right&quot; to an university education?<p>I will agree with the author that colleges charge more simply because they can. That&#x27;s the way selling stuff works. You charge more until you start selling less. I will also agree that reporters (and some essayists) have great difficulty actually looking at the problem honestly.<p>This is the tragedy of our times, this indentured servitude we are placing on the next generation. Somebody is going to have to be a grown-up here and tell people what they don&#x27;t want to hear: it is not in society&#x27;s interests to guarantee the funding of little Junior&#x27;s degree in underwater basket weaving.

7865831,comment,7863827,7865707,3,0,rayiner,,,"> You are by far in the minority by having access to FIOS as well as another cable provider. Most consumers only have a single broadband provider (and if they have only one, it&#x27;s almost certainly not FiOS).<p>The point of the anecdote is to look at how far we&#x27;ve come in 20 years. We&#x27;re in a very connected area, but we&#x27;ve still come a long way in 20 years. There&#x27;s lot&#x27;s of places that don&#x27;t have FIOS now, but those folks also didn&#x27;t have DSL in the late 1990&#x27;s. The average U.S. connection, according to Akamai, is 10 mbps. That&#x27;s a huge increase over what it was even 10 years ago.<p>> The question isn&#x27;t what people use today, given the resources they have available to them - it&#x27;s what they would choose to pay for if they had access to a faster, more reliable network.<p>The prevailing trend is a massive growth in demand for wireless broadband, with limited growth on the wired side. Unsurprisingly, that&#x27;s where companies are investing their capital.<p>> There is no way that you can convince me that consumers have more choice nowadays for cable than they did 15 years ago, or for mobile phone plans than they did 15 years ago. Competition has dramatically decreased in both markets.<p>Consumers don&#x27;t have more choices for cable or more choices for wireless, but I think they definitely have more choices for internet accounting for all the different ways of accessing the internet. In 2000, in the northern VA area, we had 256 kbps DSL run over Bell Atlantic&#x27;s wires. There were multiple ISP&#x27;s, but it was the same wires and same basic service. Today, we&#x27;ve got FIOS, four different LTE providers, DSL, and Cox cable, not to mention satellite. Not everyone has so many choices, but I think the folks that don&#x27;t have many choices today had even fewer choices back in the day.<p>> [2] I can&#x27;t imagine Con Edison operating in NYC without the heavy regulation that is is subject to; I see no reason that ISPs should be any different.<p>Con Edison is in a totally different sort of business. In the last 20 years, telecom and cable companies have gone from dial-up and analog cable to DSL, digital HFC cable networks, and in some cases fiber. What&#x27;s happened to Con Edison&#x27;s infrastructure? Nothing besides basic maintenance. People say that telecoms should be regulated like power or water companies, but totally ignore the fact that power and water companies are using the same infrastructure they were using 50 and sometimes 100 years ago. Growth in electricity demand has been stable if not decreasing for decades. Growth in internet bandwidth demand has been exponential.

Is that number increasing year over year?  If so, shouldn&#x27;t that lead to a decrease in tuition, not an increase?<p>---<p>At my university, I&#x27;m convinced #3 is the real driver of tuition increase.

It isn&#x27;t &quot;new&quot; that mountains erode and become the valley floor, one need only walk along the alluvial fans in Death Valley or any mountain valley to see this happening. There are also examples of sudden changes where large sections of a mountain, in the form of a mud slide, slide into the valley floor below. The claim then that this is &#x27;unnatural&#x27; is not supported by the evidence, the tops of the mountains will sink into the valleys, its only a question of time and agency.<p>So when this occurs naturally, if it is slow enough, it allows for top soil to form, and re-form, as the mountain shifts. If it happens to quickly in nature, or by humans, it results in a lot of exposed rock. However, if you look at the Mount St Helens eruption area, you can see that having these sorts of events (even when they happen naturally) one can reasonably quickly (30 - 50 years) achieve a nominal level of topsoil and a return to fecundity. If humans are the agency for the erosion, they can also accelerate the creation of topsoil by pre-staging components which are normally provided by bacterial colonies. That results in a much faster return to equilibrium. Some examples of humans speeding the recovery can be found in the remediation of various strip mining sites around the world.<p>Bottom line is that it seems like a lot of work to create flat, and futurely arable acreage but if they have the resources to do so, knowing in advance that is what you&#x27;re doing gives you a tremendous advantage in building your &#x27;soon to be underground&#x27; infrastructure before you cover it up with the material from the mountains on either side.",1402259752

Colleges would be free to refuse to accept this, but with the exception of the Harvard/Yale type schools, any college that did refuse the public tuition would cease to exist because nobody would go there. As long as we can come up with a value for $N that keeps colleges funded without making them rich, it would work. I would submit that the ideal value for $N is much lower than the current average tuition.<p>How do you pay for this? Take it all out of military spending. There would be plenty left over, I assure you.<p>> Another side of effect with less graduates is that maybe we can get rid of the college degree requirements<p>I would argue that there are definite benefits to a more educated population.

You&#x27;d likely have a lot of <i>accidental</i> collisions between passwords that happen to hash to the same value in your restricted keyspace, but they&#x27;d be no help in finding a purposeful collision, because the <i>input</i> keyspace would be unlimited.<p>Of course, if you only have 40 bits of output keyspace available (i.e. a field with a capacity for eight base32 characters), you &quot;only&quot; need to KDF 2^40 passwords to generate a probabilistically-complete rainbow table. So, make sure to salt <i>the compression step</i> with something user-specific, e.g. The UID. One simple method of achieving this would be to have the output look like<p><pre><code>    base32(trunc(40, kdf(pw)) XOR trunc(40, kdf(pw ++ uid)))\n</code></pre>\nThis basically means that a successful preimage attack on your compressed KDF be would require a unique collision between the salted and unsalted hash outputs—effectively doubling the output keyspace one would have to search, as well as giving you the regular benefits of per-user salts.<p>---<p>...or you <i>could</i> just put the hash of a random opaque token in the password field; stand up a modern, separate server that runs a &quot;password service&quot; (in the SOA architecture sense) to keep a map of full (UID, KDF hash) pairs to the opaque tokens; and then have your web service hit the password service to (potentially) return it a token to use as the password in the conversation with the legacy auth system.

After all, the undergraduate experience was designed for aristocrats, and if people go from young aristocrat to prole in one post-graduate summer, they might be pissed off enough to take up arms and overthrow governments, like what almost happened in the 1960s student riots. It doesn&#x27;t happen that way, however, so they (the extreme leftists) don&#x27;t get what they want.<p>Lazy centrists and liberals push for widespread higher education because they believe education to be a magical fairy dust that can be sprinkled on inequality to make it go away. (In fact, tuition and credentialism and admissions-- nonacademic admissions elements being the worst offenders-- do the opposite.) They don&#x27;t get what they want.<p>Right-wing, religious nutcases throw their weight behind <i>religious</i> education because they think it will help them in their losing cultural war against modernity.

7865710,comment,7863303,7865338,3,0,x0054,,,"The most obvious example of trying to copy the design is the charge cable of the galaxy tab. Apple&#x27;s charge cable was ridiculously and unnecessarily wide, as is evident by the fact that later on they switched to the new design of the lightning cable. Samsung made their cable plug also very wide, and very similar that I personally, on one occasion have grabbed an off brand white Samsung cable, tried to shove it into my iPad, and was rather surprised when it did not fit.<p>Rather then looking at weather or not Samsung copied apple, let&#x27;s look at the motivations. Because I believe that imitating someones design because you think its the best and the most practical way to do something should be perfectly ok. However, it is wrong to copy a design of your competitors in the hopes that consumers will confuse your product for your competitors. For instance, I would call BS on Apple arguing that a black rounded rectangle with rounded corners is somehow their design. It&#x27;s just the most obvious and straightforward way of making an glass touch tablet. But then look at the power / sync cord. Can you justify that choice? No, there is no practical reason to make your cord look like that other than to make your product look more like an iPad.<p>They do say that imitation is the sincerest from of flattery, and I do tend to believe it, as long as the motivation is right. A company can look at the fact that iPads are doing really well in the market and tell it&#x27;s designers and engineers: &quot;Let&#x27;s get a few of those iPads, play with them, figure out why people love them, and than make better one our selves, incorporating some of the features that we thing people really love about the iPad.&quot; I think that&#x27;s what ASUS did with their Transformer line. They observed that a lot of people liked the simple and clean look of the iPad, and they made it even cleaner by removing all buttons. They also decided that people really want a option to have a keyboard on a tablet, as evidenced by the abundance of the keyboard cases for the iPad, so they added that function as well.<p>On the other hand, Samsung told its engineers: &quot;Here is an iPad, copy it! No, don&#x27;t bother figuring out why people like it, use those ideas, build on them, and maybe come up with something better. Just copy it. You see that idiotic, unnecessarily wide connector that only made any kind of sense when it was first installed in the original iPod, and not even then really. Copy that too.&quot;<p>So, to finish my thought, yes Apple is a bit bitchy when people copy their stuff. In case of most manufacturers I think they are wrong. In case of Samsung, I can see it, they copied Apple, and they did it for all the wrong reasons.",1402257980

We also have 3-4 providers offering 10 mbps+ LTE.<p>You are by <i>far</i> in the minority by having access to FIOS as well as another cable provider. Most consumers only have a single broadband provider (and if they have only one, it&#x27;s almost certainly not FiOS).<p>> for your average consumer, wireless service is much more important than wired service. The average Comcast customer uses 2-3 GB/month of data. That&#x27;s easily accommodated by wireless.<p>First I question that statistic (it sounds unbelievably low for someone who uses Netflix even moderately). But even if I accept that, it&#x27;s not meaningful to talk about a hypothetical world in which a user can rely on their mobile phone plan to provide this kind of service - essentially all users are on data plans that would be throttled heavily if they tried to rely on wireless service as their primary means of Internet connectivity.<p>Secondly, that&#x27;s not a great statistic to use. The question isn&#x27;t what people use <i>today</i>, given the resources they have available to them - it&#x27;s what they would choose to pay for if they had access to a faster, more reliable network.<p>I know I would be happy to pay for proper, faster Internet access, but as it is, I&#x27;m paying through the nose for speeds that are consistently 60% of what was advertised. (This is illegal, sure, but clearly TWC doesn&#x27;t care).<p>> Consumers have a lot more choice these days between cable/wireless than they did back then.<p>We have a choice between four wireless providers[0], whereas we had far more back in the early 2000s. And that only covers mobile access as far as I&#x27;m concerned (virtually no &quot;average&quot; user can use wireless networks as their primary access point[1]).<p>There is no way that you can convince me that consumers have <i>more</i> choice nowadays for cable than they did 15 years ago, or for mobile phone plans than they did 15 years ago. Competition has dramatically decreased in both markets.<p>> Those upgrades didn&#x27;t build themselves nor were they free.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that zero upgrades happened; I&#x27;m arguing that, for what we&#x27;re paying, most consumers are not getting the level of service that they should be, and that is due to a decrease in the number of market players to a virtual monopoly, without a corresponding increase in regulation[2].<p>[0] Potentially three soon, if T-Mobile and Sprint merge<p>[1] In the US, of course. Third-world countries are a different story (look at many parts of Africa)<p>[2] I can&#x27;t imagine Con Edison operating in NYC without the heavy regulation that is is subject to; I see no reason that ISPs should be any different.",1402257947

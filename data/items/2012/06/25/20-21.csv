While one may enjoy both not everyone does, also requirements based design for business logic is a different mental processes than user story based flows for UI. One is very concrete and the other is known to be pretty mushy until the user actually touches it and sees how it responds. There are developers who do not like to iterate through fuzzy details and prefer very concrete data contracts. So they are very happy to stay on the other side of the REST contract. The good part is once they get a glimpse of the new world, they realize how much better it is for all parties involved.

4158705,comment,4155124,4155917,2,0,davesims,,,"> MS tried to produce a Java with native extensions:<p>Not exactly. MS <i>replaced</i> Java's existing native extension functionality (JNI) with Windows-only native hooks called JDirect. Interestingly, it did so with these @com (EDIT: sorry, I meant @dll -- @com was related to COM hooks, which stuck around well into the .NET era as attribute hooks) method macros that, in a way, prefigured attributes in both Java and C#.<p>EDIT: If by 'native extentions', you meant the WFC classes, then yes these were <i>additions</i>, not a replacement of JNI. But these were not part of the lawsuit <i>per se</i>. The suit focused on the removal of JNI and the corruption of the JVM spec with the JDirect functionality.<p>> plus most of the features that Java programmers were begging for that Sun was sniffing at<p>'most of the features' is pushing it a bit. The only feature that J++ had over Java 1.1 at the time was method pointers (delegate). The lawsuit focused on those corruptions of Java: removing JNI as well adding JDirect and the 'delegate' keyword. This, according to the court, violated the terms of the license agreement signed by MS.<p>Microsoft lost the lawsuit, and <i>that</i> was the reason they ditched J++ and began work on C#/.NET, which built upon many of the lessons learned in J++. I think otherwise MS's plan was to continue building an ecosystem around the MSVM not unlike what they eventually built around the CLR.<p>It would be interesting to compare the MS/Sun ruling with the recent Google/Oracle ruling, as the terms of the two suits were rather similar.<p>It would seem to me that the biggest difference there is that MS <i>did</i> in fact sign a license agreement with Sun that constrained the nature of their use of Java. Google did not sign any agreement, and I wonder if this was a calculated move on Google's part, in light of the MS/Sun J++ ruling.<p>Considering the recent ruling by Judge Alsup regarding Android's similar adoption/modification of the Java spec, does this mean Microsoft would have stood a better chance by simply <i>implementing</i> J++ with no agreement from Sun at all? On my naive, IANAL reading of it, that would seem to be the case.",1340657859

The real concerns are reliability and added complexity of the cooling system. The biggest advantages are improved longevity and performance of your engine.<p>It is true that an old car going uphill on a roasty day with the A/C on may overheat, but even then it is often a problem with poor maintenance or the wrong mix of coolant.

It is up to those who have principles and who believe in right and wrong to draw real lines in the sand, and stop giving people a pass for choosing the expedient, if wrong, option. It's one thing to show compassion for people's foibles, it's another to completely abandon the duty of honest application of principles, if you have them.<p>Basically, we need to STOP saying, ""You can't blame Fox for being liars because, after all, it works."" That perpetuates the problem.<p>So, yes, the blame is on the consumer, but for every consumer that wholeheartedly believes in Fox, there are 10 more that know Fox is a liar but tolerates it because it ""works"".

GIVEN. MOMENT. If you are not generating enough, the generators would be overloaded, start slowing down and bad things would happen (frequency would lower, your own generators and/or power lines between countries will go out of phase and bang, you have a nice large several-country-wide blackout). Similar things happen when you generate too much.<p>Therefore, mentioning the current AVERAGE green production per day and consumption per day is totally out of reality, as the ""base"" energy is still provided by the dreaded nuclear, peak oil and very dirty coal power plants. In order to cover the consumption with the ""holy"" green energy, the capacity of such power plants would have to be several times the current consumption in order to generate the energy for times when there is no wind, no sunlight (night!), etc. AND many storage plants (e.g. pumped storage) have to be built. And one pumped storage plant alone (without the power plants providing the electricity into the storage!) cost the same as adding the same net power capacity in nuclear, which goes by the projections until the next scheduled shut down, no wind onsets, etc.<p>Also, please do not be fooled with the ""Austrian model"" - ban nuclear energy in the constitution and import (nuclear!) energy from surrounding countries. Or with the ""German model"" - promise to stop nuclear power plants and: a) use ""green"" government subsidies to start COAL power plants instead (yes, environmental funds are being used to build new power plants of the most dirty kind!), b) overload surrounding grids (Polish, Czech) to dissolve peak effects of current, very unstable, ""green"" sources, c) start inventing crazy things like using home water heaters running on fossil fuels (!) controlled by computers to generate electricity into the grid when the green sources are not enough...<p>Whenever anybody is speaking about noes to nuclear power or green sources, these issues should be foremost addressed. Otherwise it is the same beating around the bush, as when biofuels are governmentally subsided and made mandatory by law to be mixed into ordinary fossil fuels, but it is kept secret that the agricultural vehicles running on the fossil fuels, spreading pesticides and fertilizers made from fossil fuels, use more energy than is finally made in the ""biofuel"". However, this happens in some other country across the globe, so it is none of our business and it is very ""green"" in our ""bio""fueled country...<p>Source: electrical engineer controlling the power grid of a European country.",1340657265

I've seen ""$1bn/yr"" quoted as Google's TAC (traffic acquisition cost) paid to Apple to be the default search provider.<p>However, I've also heard that that deal is tight and carefully negotiated. With hundreds of millions of iOS devices and that kind of TAC, it would then be reasonable to guess that Google's revenue, per iPhone user, on the order of dollars, <i>maybe</i> tens of dollars, but not <i>hundreds</i> of dollars.<p>Honestly, though, Google has never sold that many Nexus devices before... they might just want to take a loss on the whole thing to demonstrate that the device is reasonable to manufacturers, try to bootstrap the market by getting initial devices cheaply to users, or even just to make friends with Asus.<p>My guess is that they just want to screw Apple. Apple makes money by convincing people that they need to purchase and then replace expensive hardware. This hardware has a lot of margin in it, enough to provide outstanding customer service and to generally spend time on software improvements.<p>In the world of PC's, there are tons of competitors figuring out how to drive the price down, but then they don't bother to compete on design. Companies like Dell make almost no money per computer: the margins in that industry don't exist.<p>So, I contend that if Google occasionally does some ""charity"" work, maintaining an OS (at a loss) an then partnering with the currently best-scaled lower-margin device manufacturer to inject some reasonable design, they can gut Apple's business ""where it hurts"", even though they probably get almost no money from it themselves.<p>This is advantageous to Google as it allows them to keep an advantage over Apple in those negations over TAC, or make it less enticing for Apple to spend a bunch of time attempting to rebuild thigs like Maps.<p>Put differently: Google doesn't need this market: they have an already bootstrapped and epic profit model. This doesn't need to make them money directly, or even tangentially: it just needs to give them an advantage somehow, somewhere, that can be leveraged to make money.",1340656384

Unlike you, I know almost nothing about heat dynamics, nor about FEA, so my comment is predicated entirely on the Sandia staff being truthful in their video (and being quoted accurately in ars's Q&A article).  I claim zero authority on the subject.<p>Your top-level comment claims that the breakthrough in this is in the thin-air gap, rather than in the centrifugal force.  Respectfully, Sandia's Jeff Koplow specifically claims otherwise, in detail.<p>Koplow claims the boundary layer is the key problem (a claim with which you appear to agree).  He further claims that when the radiator is spinning (or otherwise accelerating) that the boundary layer thins, and that in their application it thins by roughly 10x.  See the video at 1:25 or so.  And while I don't trust my under-educated intuition particularly heavily, it's very easy to imagine how accelerating the fins is fundamentally different from blowing air across them, in terms of how it affects air molecules in the boundary layer.  Again, note that you specifically claimed ""There is no difference between spinning the heatsink and moving air at the same velocity across stationary heatsink fins"", and Koplow has specifically claimed that this is not true.<p>The fluid dynamic bearing only becomes relevant as a secondary problem: if you're going to spin your radiator but not your heat source, obviously there's a transfer problem.  Apparently this is easy enough to solve, I guess?  Koplow did mention (a year ago) that they were considering adding roughness to the revolving surfaces to perturb the air in the gap to improve transfer.<p>Oh, and you repeatedly say ""they should use fluid"".  Well, first of all my little pedantic nit-pick is that air is a fluid.  But more interestingly, the article contains a link to Q&A with more technical details, in which that very subject is discussed!  The short version as I understood it is this: viscosity kills you.<p>I guess what I'm saying here is this: you started off by saying the article was wrong (about the centrifugal force), and went on to question all the design choices involved, but I think you actually skipped the bit where you read the article in enough detail to know whether or not it was wrong.

However, plausible reductions by\nindustry in capital cost, operation and maintenance costs and construction\ntime could reduce the gap. Carbon emission credits, if enacted by government,\ncan give nuclear power a cost advantage. The situation remains the same\ntoday.</i><p>... citing increased construction costs across the board, increases in interest rates during construction of recent plants, and a decline in the cost of oil and gas costs after a spike in the mid-2000s. Their base case suggested nuclear at 6.7 cents/kWh, and coal/gas at 4.3/4.1. With carbon corrections, coal/gas rises to 6.4/5.1. With capital corrections equivalent to coal plants, nuclear falls to 5.5 cents/kWh.<p>Keep in mind that US data on nuclear efficiency is limited <i>because we haven't built any new reactors</i> in the last 30 years. We're running plants a generation (and a half) behind current technology, and they're <i>still</i> this efficient. Meanwhile, extracting gas and coal is becoming more difficult, and not likely to get any easier. Just take a look at the economic feasibility studies of Alberta's tar sands.<p>MIT's opinion?<p><i>In sum, compared to 2003, the motivation to make more use of nuclear power\nis greater, and more rapid progress is needed in enabling the option of nuclear\npower expansion to play a role in meeting the global warming challenge. The\nsober warning is that if more is not done, nuclear power will diminish as a\npractical and timely option for deployment at a scale that would constitute a\nmaterial contribution to climate change risk mitigation.</i><p>Honestly, the phrase ""clean coal"" should have have been clue enough to stop reading. :-/",1340655987

Machining a reasonably flat reference surface on a CNC lathe or mill isn't all that difficult.  The question in my mind is more about how flat these surfaces have to be.

And we burn through a lot of money doing so.<p>Every mark on every blueprint gets checked and rechecked by multiple, well-paid engineers. We go through elaborate and time-consuming testing procedures. Multiple layers of redundancy are built in.<p>All of this costs. And the greater the danger, the more of this kind of stuff we have to do. Nuclear accidents are black swan events. Though unlikely, their impact can be huge. So for nuclear power, the engineering requirements are extreme. This is as it should be.<p>If nuclear power were deregulated, the industry would still have to spend boatloads to provide adequate safety. And if the industry instead cut corners, they'd eventually get bit by another disaster, and the business would once again stagnate.<p>This, by the way, is coming from a guy who doesn't work in the nuclear power industry.

I know that it can take a lot to break-up the boundary layer in any meaningful way.  In aircraft design there are reasons having nothing to do with heat transfer to want to break-up the boundary layer.  As I understand it this can be difficult to achieve across a large surface (I'm assuming at sub-sonic speeds, don't know).  They even resort to such devices as drilling small holes and literally sucking the boundary layer from the surface.  This problem is tougher than it might seem.  I am not an aero guy, I've learned a lot from thousands of hours dedicated to finding solutions to our specific problems, but I am far from an expert.  Maybe an aero expert on HN can fill-in some of the holes.<p>At some level, think about it this way:  At some point, microscopic as it might be, some of the air molecules touching the fins have to ""stick"" to the surface of the fins.  At that point air molecule velocity with respect to the fin surface is zero.  Then there are molecules that stick to these molecules one layer above, and so on.  After a certain thickness the greater airflow will win out and molecules will move at the average velocity of the bulk air mass moving across the fins.  What you have is a velocity profile from zero to the average air mass velocity. That's your boundary layer.  You can do things to make it thinner, but eliminating it is very difficult.  Techniques like impingement cooling do this to varying degrees of efficiency.",1340654588

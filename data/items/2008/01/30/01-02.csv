We would need to posit at least ten hypothetical Paul Grahams before the dangerous ability to simply define one's own functions (even redefine system functions, oh my!) and pass them around would become dangerously confusing.<p>This raises the question: is there a theoretical limit of HPGs? How many would be required before we could justify just writing machine instructions?",1201654981

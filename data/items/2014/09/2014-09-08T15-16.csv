8285498,comment,8283629,8283735,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Isn&#x27;t that a normal orbit around a common centre of mass?<p>If you limit yourself to looking at the position of one body with respect to another, the orbit will be an ellipse. A circular orbit is simply a special-case ellipse with an eccentricity of zero. This is true for any two orbiting masses -- from the perspective of either of them, the other body&#x27;s orbit will be an ellipse. And yes, it&#x27;s always with respect to the common center of mass.<p>Interestingly, mostly because of Jupiter, the solar system&#x27;s common center of mass can sometimes lie outside the sun.",1410191974

You have great talent for making arrogance and ad hominems sound polite and subtle, which is something I can strangely appreciate in a twisted sense. Well played.<p>I will respond to some things you have asked from me. I do not expect a response, but will leave them here for others to read.<p>> But again, to be fair, I do not think there is some rational method, in a scientific sense, that proves one element of any religion right or wrong.<p>There are many with that capability. The quintessential one is Kantian ethics. One other method I will mention simply because I happen to have read it recently, is outlined in &quot;The Moral Landscape&quot; by Sam Harris.<p>> How, if you want to pretend the whole of Muslim society (and that is a lot of people, even the parts of it in the US) want to &quot;live under early medieval law because their religion says so&quot;, I would love for you to show me where it says so.<p>I did not claim that the whole of Muslim society wants this, and I find it insulting that you put those words in my mouth. \nI was pointing out that opinions on upturning society are an <i>important opinion</i> in Muslim (sub)societies, as evidenced by opinion polls [1].<p>> Islam has problems. So do other religions. But if Islam has special religion status and special problems that proclude it from issues other religions avoided, I would love to hear them. Try to explain them rationally. You will see how bleak that looks.<p>I&#x27;ll just leave the general argument as to why Islam does a particular bad job as a reference frame from which to perform critical thinking.<p>First up: do not interpret what I&#x27;m saying next as any sort of defence of Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism or Hinduism. Religion is a bad place to start building a society from in the first place. I&#x27;ll limit my commentary to mainstream religions as they tend not to affect geopolitics.<p>Islam does a worse job of building an effective critical-thinking society than other mainstream religions. Some things that are uniquely combined Islam are the following:<p>- Islam has a text that is the <i>literal</i> word of God; not &quot;words inspired&quot; by God as is the case in many others. Since the word is taken to be literal, it is easier to commit apostasy as it is more difficult to hide behind interpretation.<p>- The penalty for deviating thought is death in all schools of Islam. Other holy texts also claim this, but certainly not all schools of other religions claim the same.<p>- No school of Islam has emerged that takes back on these opinions. The best of enlightenment you get is people claiming that people should get a second chance, but thought crime still leads to death.<p>Because of these issues, mainstream Islamic thinking is less open to deviating opinion, critical thinking, sensitivities, or at least the open discussion of topics. These issues make it easier to justify totalitarianism or elements thereof in an Islamic context. There is no &quot;Reformed Judaism&quot; version of Islam that is openly and widely practiced. And that appears to be a burden for every Muslim who wants to be a critical thinker and wants to build a society on freedom and progress.<p>[1]: A link directory that admittedly is focused on making a point (but that by itself does not make the point invalid): <a href=""http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/opinion-polls.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/opinion-polls.htm</a>",1410191488

Resharper does this, and will even name things appropriately for you (if the container is something like myInts or intList, it will name the item myInt).<p>Yeah, but e.g. in C++ there are many styles of for-loops. How does the IDE find out what you want to do? Different projects adopt different for styles (size_t, iterators, etc.).<p>>Is it myList.length(), myList.length, myList.Count, len(myList), count(myList)?<p>That&#x27;s a legitimate question, but how does your IDE help there? I solve the problem using a<p>&quot;<language> get length of list&quot;<p>web-search. Can your IDE answer this question? If I just type<p>myList.<p>I will get usually a drop-down menu of all the methods. But then I have to try &quot;c&quot; for count, &quot;l&quot; for length, etc. In particular I have to assume that the size function is a method which is the case in Java, C++, but e.g. not in Python. Or does JetBrains Python version (PyCharm I think) rewrite a.length to len(a)?<p>My main IDE complaint is that IDEs lock you into languages, libraries and workflows. If you work with a text editor your have to know<p><pre><code>  - the language\n  - the text editor\n  - your build system\n  - your version control system\n</code></pre>\nIf you work with an IDE you have to know<p><pre><code>  - the language\n  - a text editor (e.g. remote sessions without X)\n  - the build system\n  - the version control software\n  - the ide\n  - probably a plugin that makes your ide editor behave like your text editor\n  - a plugin for your language\n  - a plugin for you build system\n  - in general: how does the IDE&#x27;s plugin system work\n</code></pre>\nSo I like the idea of IDEs, but for me the abstraction always fails and I struggle with its plugins. I give them a try sometimes but most of them are locked into eco-systems:<p><pre><code>  - qtcreator: QT, C++\n  - eclipse: Java\n  - netbeans: Java\n  - PyCharm: Python\n  - Clion: C/C++\n</code></pre>\nIf you work with different languages, libaries and workflows it is often not trivial to make the IDE adapt (in particular, most of them have their own definition of &quot;projects&quot; and scatter you directory trees with hidden files) and the whole dev-setup gets more complicated. What do you do if you have to use a language that&#x27;s not supported by the IDE?<p>The text editor abstraction feels more honest: &quot;Look your project is a bunch of text files. I give you the following interface to explore/change this text blobs.&quot; Again, I like the idea, but good IDEs were always locked into eco-systems and these change so fast that the IDE seems always behind.

This bytecode is split into two categories - &quot;safe&quot; bytecode, where none of the operations could cause issues (read: runtime arrays bounds checks, that sort of thing), and &quot;unsafe&quot;, which includes a formal proof of &quot;correctness&quot; - that is, a formal proof that it doesn&#x27;t access memory it hasn&#x27;t initialized, etc, which the compiler checks for correctness. (Note: the kernel does not do any attempt at making a proof, &quot;just&quot; checking it) The kernel compiles bytecode to machine code before execution, with caching as appropriate (similar to how Python handles compilation, for example).<p>The advantage here is that you can end up running native code everywhere (and also potentially not having to worry about usermode <-> kernel switches, memory segmentation, etc), without having to worry about malicious code. Also, it&#x27;ll be a lot easier to port. Yes, it&#x27;s going to be slower. (Although some of that may be offset by lack of context switches and not having to be paranoid about kernel arguments, etc. Considering that the attack surface is small (&quot;just&quot; the bootstrap code and bare-bones HAL), it may be possible to just run everything in ring 0 / cooperative multitasking / flat memory model.)",1410190246

When the client receives this status, it should initiate a refresh process which trades an expired token for a new one.<p>The refresh endpoint on the server should take an expired token and perform the following:<p>1. Validate token (except expiration)<p>2. Retrieve user ID and check if token is in its issuedTokens collection<p>3. Issue a new JWT<p>4. Remove the expired token from the collection and add the new one<p>Upon failure of any of these steps, an Unauthorized error should be sent to client which then requires logging in again.<p>To prevent a never-ending build-up of issued tokens, we can set a TTL on the tokens in the issuedTokens collection. Set the TTL value to the amount of time that a login should be active for before requiring logging in again.<p>This approach doesn&#x27;t hit the database unless you keep trying to refresh an expired token. In which case you can make use of a cached blacklist of failed tokens. This can reside next to the application itself if treated as a cache layer.<p>This is definitely just a work-in-progress solution that I&#x27;m about to test out.

WHAT THE HELL WERE THESE PEOPLE SMOKING?<p>I think the head scratching about Excel&#x27;s (and probably other spreadsheets) behavior on <i>empty cells</i> is misguided.  Yes, if you have a computer scientist mindset then it might seem very mathematically satisfying to have strict rigorous logic around empty cells but we&#x27;re getting into 3-valued NULL handling like databases.  That type of extra logic checking is misplaced considering the origins of spreadsheets (e.g. Dan Bricklin&#x27;s VisiCalc) as a <i>business computation</i> tool instead of a GUI for an E.F. Codd relational db.<p>If a particular power user finds the typical &quot;null&quot; cell behavior to be &quot;wrong&quot;, he can add formulas to his cells such as:<p>=IF(ISBLANK(C3), NA(), C3)<p>... such that #NA# (Excel&#x27;s quasi &quot;null&quot;) propagates throughout any SUM() and other calculations.<p>However, imagine if the situation was reversed and we had an alternate universe where Excel propagated empty cells as #NA# instead of zero to satisfy the logic of computer scientists.  We&#x27;d inevitably have:<p>1) Microsoft adds a button wizard on the toolbar to bulk fill &quot;null&quot; cells with 0.<p>2) User forums with power-users trading VBA macros to fill in zeros of empty cells.  <i>&quot;Ugh! How do I get rid of all these useless #NA# littering my spreadsheet???&quot;</i><p>3) Microsoft adds an user option checkbox to &quot;treat empty cells as zero instead of #NA#&quot; -- which everyone ends up activating as a defacto setting.  This cancels out the strict null handling the computer scientists were imposing on the spreadsheet!<p>I contend this alternate universe scenario is much worse for business users of Excel.  In other words, you can&#x27;t &quot;force fit&quot; the concept of NULL as a default where it is not natural.  The end users will just work their way around it.",1410189726

Modern web-scrapers often have to be smart enough to incorporate almost a full web-stack of technology, since if you lack JS or CSS rendering it is trivial to hide content from you or worse give you bad content the users won&#x27;t even see (and also keep in mind the scraper has to &quot;understand&quot; CSS using its own logic, as it cannot &quot;view&quot; the result).<p>They can also dynamically alter how the page is rendered (e.g. if you&#x27;re treating DOM like a tree and going down to a specific branch, it is trivial to re-order the HTML to break that). CSS effectively removes the relationship between HTML tag order and location on the page.<p>If I had a team of engineers working full time, I could likely maintain a 90%+ good Amazon web-scraper after about a year of pure development on it (likely using something like WebKit as a starting point). But nobody puts in this type of effect because sooner or later Amazon would sue you for something obscure and effectively win via lawyers fees alone.<p>An easier solution is just to hire Mechanical Turk-like people to look at pages, note down the price, and pay them 1c/price.

Therefore, all scientific analysis is unverifiable. Knowledge of the world is completely unjustified. Not to mention our immense presumption of consistency in world phenomena when we really have no basis for asserting uniformity of nature. Read Hume on causality.<p>&quot;Belief in the Causal Nexus is superstition&quot; - Wittgenstein<p>If knowledge requires certainty, and our method of determining certainty is an infinite regress of reduction, it is like a recursive function which never returns a value.<p>Logic is inherently a comparison operator, and if logic is the only mechanism available to us, we are trapped in a purely relational analysis and it is impossible for the mind to conceive of certainty beyond a non-reasonable emotional preordained state of knowing. A feeling so powerful it is personally indubitable.<p>The premise of a singularity is invalid since it is inconceivable and the idea that causation is at any time inferred via comparison is fundamentally incomprehensible. If the premise is unclear then the argument is invalid.<p>If I say that an airplane functions on fairy dust and you make an argument about propulsion and lift, and you claim that my assertion is wrong because I have not properly performed a rational reduction and that a detail I do not understand could invalidate my entire theory, well guess what neither of us is technically correct to any degree since the test for invalidity applies equally to both of our assumptions. The concept of proof is also an oxymoron.<p>Hence, the very concept of phenomenal causation is an oxymoron. The notion of knowledge about the world is a disguise for a coping mechanism based on hope and desire.",1410189352

Those abstractions would be very useful for the signal processing and planning and those are areas that are performance critical.<p>But for code that isn&#x27;t so performance critical that you&#x27;re always thinking about where everything is in memory, you might as well just use a garbage collector and it&#x27;s easier if that&#x27;s built into the language.

Both Roboto and Droid Sans are nightmare Frankenfonts.<p>I like Roboto, but what do you find to be bad about those fonts?<p>> Font rendering on Android is bulky, blocky, and fails to consider how humans read letterforms. So, even if a designer can convince the team to license a better font, itll end up a smeared mess on users screens.<p>This isn't really true when setting custom typefaces on various views. Just subclass them and set up the typeface in the constructor and you are done. You just end up using that subclass your in layouts instead of a standard TextView.<p>> It pisses me off to look at Android because its not disappointing, the way Win8 is, but actively anti-design.<p>I'm not really sure what you mean w.r.t to text. The text views and code cover most use cases and offer ways to handle flowing text in some cases, but you can always fall back to WebView rendering text content (which is easier for writers or editors to handle when making the text content).",1361141401

It's along the lines of invasive surveillance in a totalitarian police state for the sake of ""security"". Treating your paying customers in such way is a gross disrespect. DRM does exactly that - it's preemptive policing which violates privacy and treats users as potential criminals by default. It's insulting and unethical to do so.<p>I'm not even saying that it's pointless, since it doesn't prevent piracy. DRM punishes and insults paying customers who care to buy the content, and does nothing to stop illegal redistribution and doesn't affect those who don't care to buy and pirate the stuff.

This brings the price of the 240 mile range model to $91,900, plus tax and licensing. It is not a warranty that replaces the battery if it fails. It offers no coverage before 8 years, and at 8 years one may replace at any time.<p>The 6800 3100mA 3.7V Panasonic 18650 Li-ion battery cells used in the Tesla S battery pack have an expected recharge life of 500 charges, which is just over a year if you commute and recharge daily, and is less if you do high amperage recharging such as by using supercharger stations. Most current users are commuting on occasion with their Tesla and do not recharge daily, but 2-3 times a week, so the battery, by avoiding Superchargers, will likely last 4-5 years before the range is reduced to the point that it becomes a problem. This leaves the driver with a car that has a significantly reduced driving range for years 5 through 8 of ownership while waiting for the replacement policy to kick in. (Also worth noting is that for Li Ion battery technology, battery life is damaged by high operating temperature, Arizona drivers in particular should expect shorter life, Alaskan drivers can expect longer life.)<p>Tesla does offer a $40,000 at-cost replacement for drivers whose batteries have bricked due to not being recharged properly, left in parking lots, or are more than a few years old. This is consistent with the lowest wholesale costs of these battery cells on the global market, with no markup for their added value of the battery enclosure, cooling, heating, monitoring, and recharging hardware, thus it is a fair deal and good value as Tesla is clearly not taking any profit at this battery price point.",1361140695

But cars that last longer and don't need as much repairs (theoretically) means less being built, less being repaired, less jobs all the way down the line from the manufacture of spare parts to the installation and general maintenance. \nThere are similar implications for moving from the massively complex oil industry to a much simpler and flexible electric one. Particularly if solar is the chosen source, vs. hydro or nuclear where, I think, more people would be needed in the process.<p>Lastly, a reduction of spending and resulting taxes (which for fuel are currently huge) would also have mass implications for government.<p>Maybe we don't label any of these things good/bad. They just are, and will need to be dealt with.<p>I hope people are looking at these opportunities and the implications for the economy.<p>Lastly, how do people feel about calling Elon Musk the 'heir to Steve Jobs and the second coming of da Vinci'?

Peer-pressure is responsible for most of the unwanted consumption that the author mentions. If we lived in a society where reading and debating on books was considered an accepted and revered social activity, then we would have many more people reading books than (say) watching sports.<p>I don't really blame most people for having that kind of  feeling (we are humans after all) but it does help to sometimes take a step back and ask ourselves why we live our life the way we do.<p>Ben Franklin used that kind of peer-pressure to learn new skills so it can be used for doing good too",1361138685

Or would you prefer a bank savings account, insured against loss, that produces a return of less than 1%?<p>A bank savings account is safe by one definition, but since it's an example of sanctioned corporate theft, it's not safe at all.<p>> The assumption that your money won't run out is not a given.<p>That assumption depends on the wisdom of those who run the accounts. There are any number of ways to prevent eroding the principal, primarily by paying attention to investment growth and inflation.<p>> I don't know what the story is with these retired by 30 people, but I would be willing to bet a fair number of them will find themselves broke and returning to work at some point in their lives.<p>Well, I happen to be one who successfully retired young. I wrote a best-selling program (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer</a>) in 1980 (wen I was 35), made a bundle, and retired. I sailed solo around the world for four years, had a lot of adventures, and every year I travel to Alaska in my latest boat to photograph grizzly bears. And in constant dollars, I have approximately the same nest egg that I did when I started.<p>It's simple -- all you need to do is pay attention to your investments and to inflation.<p>> You also aren't accounting for inflation, which means as you age either you're going to have to cut your expenses ~3% a year or you're going to have to increase your withdrawls ~3% a year.<p>What? No, all you need to do is adjust your withdrawals to account for inflation. That's simple -- it's as simple as multiplying two or three numbers together as in my prior post.<p>Required nest egg = desired annual income * inflation factor / investment return<p>Nest egg = $50K * 1.03 / 0.08 = $644K<p>This could obviously be rearranged to change the expected annual income instead of the size of the nest egg.<p>And if the rate of inflation changes, you change the inflation factor and recompute <i>before</i> going to the bank.",1361138568

The 440V high amperage charge also lessens the life of the battery - Lithium Ion cells don't like high amperage or temperatures. Fortunately battery replacements are only $40,000.<p>A 240V 24A charger which is much more common, and which is not paid for by Tesla so has its own terms, can recharge 18 miles of range per hour of charge, so 13 hours are needed for a full recharge.<p>A 240V 40A charger can recharge 31 miles of range per hour of charge, so 8 hours are needed for a full recharge.<p>Tesla also notably recommended that people drive low speeds on long trips to increase the chances they will see ranges of 240 miles as opposed to the 170 or so that seems to be under more typical driving conditions.<p>When one is off of the Tesla routes on the west and east coast, and driving a steady 60mph without climate control, one can travel 240 miles per 12 hour period if they have access to the higher capacity 240V/40A charger exactly every 240 miles (20 mph average speed), or 240 miles per 17 hours with the 240V/20A station (14.1 mph average speed). This is assuming there is no cold weather. If there is cold weather or faster driving, that reduces to a 170 mile range per 12 or 17 hour period (10-14mph average).<p>Tesla plans to address this with a nationwide network of Supercharger stations which will reduce the full recharge time dramatically, at the cost of shorter battery life.<p>Tesla claims that all energy for the network, which requires the ability to deliver to 4 cars simultaneously in 1 hour about 100kWh total of power per 85kWh capacity charge, will run exclusively on a small 30 kW max rated capacity installation of solar powered panels at each 4 car charge station and that customers will not only ""Drive for Free.

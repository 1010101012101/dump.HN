Your logo is pixelated, it looks like something from the CGA days.<p>The search results box is way too small. That should be the main area. You're probably thinking that the map is cool, but as someone who has written GMaps mashups, I can tell you it's not that cool. You could even get away with not showing it at all, and only popping it up onClick. Yeah, it seems cool to show Budapest when I type ""Budapest"", but frankly, I know where I live. Also, at this point you're not putting down markers anyway!<p>So, I'd rethink the layout a little.",1216796080

254137,comment,250704,253423,0,0,jerry5,,,"P.S. The portals (I worked for one of those) are a step in the right direction as their convenient UI and STP lowers the cost of a transaction in terms of human effort, but other than that add little value on top of what's offered by the banks. They are at most leaf nodes in the networks as they can't hold money even intermittently and the actual settlement still takes place through the banks. So they cannot open 'new routes' in the network.",1216795205

It was THE premier way to move money if you were involved with any sort of electronic fraud.<p>All you had to do was cash-out someone's bank account then wire the money to an e-gold affiliate, who deposits it into your online account. All transactions are irreversible. e-gold kept minimal records and after the money enters an offshore account, the government has little chance of recovery.<p>There were millions of dollars being moved through e-gold with fraud. They purposely made the process easy with as little verification as needed. Their market was criminals. I'm sure most of their profit came out of transaction fees related to fraud.<p>Where's the innovation? Their site looks like shit. They just managed to find a loophole to look legitimate and survive this long. I'm not surprised that the owners plead guilty to conspiracy to engage in money laundering.",1216794672
254132,comment,253194,253351,0,0,miked,,,">>No, software patents are a tool for trolls, nothing more. Every invalidated software patent is a victory for mankind.<p>This is much too strong, I think. I'm a co-founder of a small biotech startup with a single patent to its name. We had trouble enough raising money even with the patent. Do you think that I, or anyone else, would have put up with all the pain and the long hours in the lab if we new that Agilent or Biorad could swoop in at any moment and take our markets away from us using their marketing clout?<p>>> If, OTOH, you believe that the intended purpose of software patents was to allow deep-pocketed corporations to patent-troll their smaller competitors to death... the system is working precisely as designed.<p>Sometimes, no doubt. But Borland and that small storage company both cleaned Microsoft out for over $100,000,000 apiece, and MSFT's market cap is a bit larger.<p>A patent is a limited term legal monopoly which effectively creates a legal partnership between a government and, say, a three person startup on the one hand and, oh, Google on the other. Without the patent it's you and your buddies against Larry and Sergey and you're just bringing a knife to a gunfight. Since this site is largely devoted to startups, this would seem to be an important point.<p>I think the real solution is to shorten the terms of software patents to, say, 7 years and tighten up the meaning of ""obvious to one schooled in the art"". That would immediately reduce the patent infringement search space while still giving a small company time to build a first-mover market advantage.",1216794479

254130,comment,250704,250757,0,0,ghs,,,"""The biggest problem I see is that hosted apps are great, but these guys need the software to be up all the time.""<p>I was the Director of IT for a $250mm startup, a little under 5 years old.  We started, as almost all valley startups do, using quick books for our financials.  Very quickly issues like Purchase Orders, Expense Reports, became more important so we looked to move to an online SAAS financials system - we chose Netsuite.  Our internet connectivity grew as the number of our employees grew, until today, at 120 employees, we have a finance/procurement department of 10 people, and a 3 Mbit connection to the internet.  Our Financial software has been on the Internet somewhere for the last 4+ years, and has never gone down.  I used to be impressed that our DSL link was as reliable as our T1, until an ISP explained to me that they were probably both landing on the same equipment on the back end - just one of them was coming at me with T1 Framing.<p>This is just a long way of saying that Internet connectivity can be assumed now.  Large (very large) companies don't think twice of oursourcing their business critical functions, and, in fact, as we transition from Netsuite to Oracle Financials, we didn't even consider hosting it ourselves - found a third party and paid them $5500/month to host it for us - access over a L2L IPSEC link.<p>Anybody want to form a YC company - don't worry about the Internet Part - unless you are building a real-time/nuclear/medical/navigation/flight safety product/etc..., hosted apps are the way of the future.",1216794024

254128,comment,254021,254114,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"understanding the 3d elements of computers such as raised buttons and stacks of tabs or folders seems to be a big tripping point. They aren't sure what they can click on and are afraid to just start clicking because they think it will break something.  For them ""break something"" means when the computer does anything that they haven't seen it do before.
Simplified web for old people would probably work as just the same browser but with big instruction boxes popping up everywhere.  Google would look the same, but with a box and big arrow pointing and saying ""type what you want then click here!""
basically someone should make the paper clip of microsoft office for firefox. It would intelligently identify common tasks and offer suggestions.",1216793828

Never found an investor.  But we had working (hardware) prototypes.<p>The second one (indiebuyer.net) made some revenue but ultimately ran out of money and folded.<p>The third one was acquired by Richard Branson and is now Virgin Charter.  (That wasn't an exit, so I still haven't made any money from it.  But it's looking promising.  At least it's still in business, and doing well last I heard.)<p>The fourth one is looking pretty promising as well.  (Actually there's a fifth one too, which is also looking pretty good.)<p>So I've been at it off and on for fifteen years (we started FlowNet in '93) and I still haven't made a dime off a startup of my own.

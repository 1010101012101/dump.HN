9978500,comment,9977342,9978200,0,0,dbarlett,,,".an (Netherlands Antilles) is being phased out [1]:<p><pre><code>    The .AN top-level domain for the Netherlands Antilles is no longer eligible for
    continued delegation, as it is no longer an ISO 3166-1 two-letter code. In
    accordance with the code’s removal from the ISO 3166-1 standard, the ISO 3166
    Maintenance Agency asks users of the standard to “stop using [the code] ASAP”†.
    
    As discussed in detail in the consideration of a similar case of the .YU
    top-level domain, ICANN’s role is to be an independent technical coordinator of
    the domain name system. As such, the ISO 3166-1 standard was chosen as the
    arbiter for what is, and what is not, a basis for country-code domains. In order
    to retain consistency with the standard, ICANN coordinates the removal of the
    .AN domain in conjunction with the transition to its successor domains. In such
    cases, ICANN asks the current operator to perform an orderly wind-down and
    transition process.
    
    The proposed sponsoring organisation for .CW intends to continue to operate the
    .AN domain while transitional arrangements are executed. These transitional
    arrangements include provisions for registrants in Curaçao to transfer
    registrations to .CW; and for registrants in Sint Maarten to transfer
    registrations to .SX. The applicant calls for a phased transition to be
    concluded over a period of three years, after which time the .AN domain will be
    fully retired.

They buy goods from manufacturers, then sell those goods to consumers for higher prices and pocket (or spend) the profits. Pretty simple. They provide a great service that makes it easier for people to buy and sell stuff, and they get paid well to do it.<p>But what if all of Amazon&#x27;s customers wanted to band together and cut out the middleman? They could use their collective buying power to get the same prices from manufacturers, but eliminate the profit and just pay lower prices. It&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;d be hard to achieve. Who would run the system? How would they make decisions? It&#x27;s so hard that the customers would give up, finish buying their disposable consumer goods, watch an episode of Humans and go to sleep.<p>Or one of them could come up with a solution. &quot;Hey y&#x27;all, I wrote the software for a marketplace system to connect us all directly to manufacturers, but I know you can&#x27;t trust me to never take a cut if I run the system myself. So instead, I&#x27;ll run it on a global computer that no one controls. Programs on the global computer can never change, and no one can fake their data. That means the system will be out of my control and the rules are set in stone. It&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s system.&quot;<p>That global computer is called Ethereum, and it lets us build new kinds of software that can coordinate human interactions so powerfully that this guy&#x27;s solution just might work. You could build other kinds of apps on Ethereum too, like voluntary social safety nets, apps that let your future smart appliances talk to each other long after their manufacturer shuts down, or pretty much the entire financial industry—all without any middlemen to charge you or restrict your access.<p>If you know how to program, you should learn how to build apps on Ethereum.

Reduce the taboo and let people know that while it&#x27;s not pleasant talking about this stuff to loved ones, it&#x27;s better than the alternative. Improve mental health clinical services and subsidise the cost of appropriate medication. Raise awareness of the issue itself without getting into hysteria, so people know that it&#x27;s there and can look for markers in friends and family, but also that something can be done about it.

If a lot of people do this, it seems like it could pose a risk to Tor users&#x27; anonymity.<p>Tor works by bouncing traffic across a few nodes. In an ideal case, these nodes are run by different people in different countries, so even if a vulnerability in a server or legal action exposes the traffic across a single relay, the other nodes are not accessible to the attacker and the users&#x27; anonymity is maintained.<p>If a large number of people start running nodes on cloud services, then this centralizes the nodes under the control of Amazon or whatever cloud provider. Even if you trust Amazon (there are many use cases where you shouldn&#x27;t) a vulnerability in their cloud services could expose data from ALL of the nodes running on their cloud. I haven&#x27;t done any specific analysis on this, but my guess is that if 5% of the nodes in the Tor relay system had their data completely exposed, the nodes would include all the nodes along routes for a significant number of users. Combine this with traffic analysis and other attacks, and even more users could be de-anonymized.<p>I&#x27;m by no means an expert on Tor, so I can&#x27;t say with confidence whether or not this is a concern.

9978282,comment,9976440,9977830,0,0,searine,,,"A couple general tips : 
1. For second-wave bioinformatic analysis, stick to organisms that have a (semi) decent reference sequence. It removes untold among of noise from your eventual analysis. M. tuberculosis, for example is a good candidate as it has an excellent reference.<p>2. Human diseases always have tons of data!<p>>Are the SNPs identified in these separate geographical studies distinct or similar?<p>Human pathogens almost always show strong population structure that corealtes with human migration.<p>That means, distincit old world/new world/oceania varieties characterized by differing patterns in variation. They also show recent population bottlenecks that correspond to the out-of-africa migration, and the columbian expansion. (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n10/full/ng.2744.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n10/full/ng.2744.html</a>)<p>These kind of studies usually sequence a bunch of individuals, and then run RaXML to make a maximum likelihood tree, and run a principle component analysis to further characterize the population structure. This is usually followed by some first-pass selection scans to identify genes of interest.<p>The problem is that this is all &quot;low hanging fruit&quot;, and it is always picked by the people who did (and paid for) the sequencing.<p>> Do the metabolic pathways identified from these different strains of TB explain different viral adaptations to the host and its environment?<p>Metabolism is an essential feature to fitness, it rarely changes at the population level. If metabolic genes do change, they are usually secondary metabolism. Central metabolism is extremely conserved.<p>In human pathogens the things evolving are (in order of magnitude) :<p>1. Resistance to antibiotics/antivirals/antiparasitic. This is huge. It creates MASSIVE selective sweeps.<p>2. Host/pathogen interface. Classic red-queen hypothesis. Antigen genes are rapidly evolving to evade host defence and maintain ability for invasion.<p>3. Trasmission. Virulence factors which enhance the fitness of the pathogen.<p>> I&#x27;m sure my posed questions are either already answered in literature, not posed properly and not feasible. But that&#x27;ll be my starting point.<p>I think, with a second-wave analysis. You need to gear your questions according to the datasets you can get your hands on.<p>Start by picking an organism. Then research how many individual genomes from that species you can get. Then design an experiment around that.<p>A classic &quot;second wave&quot; bioinformatic analysis uses two reference genomes, and a sequenced population of individuals from one of the two species. The experiment performs a simple statistical test to measure the accrual of non-synonymous substitutions within a species, and compares it to the accural of NS substitutions between species. Using these rates you can infer evolutionary adaptation/neutrality/conservation. It&#x27;s called the McDonald-Kreitman test, here is a web implementation for a single-gene example <a href=""http://mkt.uab.es/mkt/help_mkt.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mkt.uab.es/mkt/help_mkt.asp</a> <-- try doing this by hand by pulling protein sequences from online databases.<p>It&#x27;s a simple algorithm, that can easily be scaled to a genome wide scan for adaptation (followed by an FDR correction for multiple testing!!!!!!).<p>The experiment for M. tuberculosis would go like this :<p>1. Either find an existing set of ortholog predictions between M. tuberculosis compared some other near species with a reference genome (preferably same-genus), or calculate them yourself with orthoMCL. Filter this to exclude everything BUT one-to-one orthologs. You can only run the MK test on one-to-one orthologs.<p>2. Extract out the protein sequence (gene->mRNA->translated protein) for each annotated gene in each of the two reference files. A GFF file (gene feature file) should be available for each reference telling you the coordinates of each gene so you can get the exons and translate them to make a protein. If there isn&#x27;t a gff, you can predict genes using genome annotation software. Match protein from genome A, to its ortholog in genome B, using the data from step 1, and put the two sequences into a single fasta file. Do this for all single copy genes.<p>2. Pull a population of 10 or so individual M. tuberculosis genomes from SRA. Align the reads to the M. tuberculosis reference. Pull out proteins like before. Match them to the ortholog sequences from step 1 and 2, so everything in all in one file.<p>3. Take your fasta file which contains M. tuberculosis reference, second reference, and the 10 or so individuals and align each protein file using Muscle (an alignment program, look it up).<p>4. Implement a MK test that can run on your aligned fasta file. Spot check it against the online single-gene implementation I linked.<p>5. Take your resulting p-values and perform an FDR correction to account for testing thousands of genes within the genome.<p>6. Calculate alpha (its on the MKT wiki article), and determine which of your significant gens have a positive value of alpha (because positive alpha means more within-species NS substituions == positive selection == interesting).<p>7. Congrats, you have done the science and learned about whats changing within the M. tuberculosis species.",1438291684

Windows 10 users are upgrading from 7 and 8.1, these versions were heavily shipped with bloatware. If it took away default browsing from Firefox, it also took away volume control from OEM Volumizer 2010.<p>2. Your browsers like IE, Mozilla and Chrome might have Malware toolbars installed. Nobody can deny that it is far too common on Windows PCs. If it opened the infected browser the first thing after update, how secure is your PC now?<p>3. Microsoft has taken deliberate steps to make Firefox the default browser <i>easier</i>. The is an entire section now in Settings that lists 8-10 typical apps like browsers and one can easily set Firefox to default from there. It is not like old days when you had to go fidget with individual settings of each browser.<p>4. If you were savvy enough to put FF as default on Win 7, you are savvy enough to change it on Win 10. People not as savvy <i>need</i> a robust unbreakable solution.<p>5. The XYZ browser you were using might not be fully Windows 10 compatible. It is absolutely weird to expect default apps to remain same after a major upgrade. The cannot give individual vendors like Mozilla or Google special treatment here, nor can they take responsibility for their development cycles.<p>6. It&#x27;s not bad for users. They aren&#x27;t defaulting on IE7. Edge is fantastic.<p>7. In 2015, browsing should be considered a core OS feature that <i>cannot</i> be broken for upgrading users.<p>8. Microsoft had a weird history of over preserving user settings. It didn&#x27;t leave them any place good. They still remain the most backwards compliant in any aspect.<p>9. Windows 10 does preserve old settings for extensions it doesn&#x27;t support out of the box.<p>But the biggest point left out in this debate is that Microsoft has made it as easy as mobile to change default apps.

If the landlords really believed the bust were 3 or 4 years out, given the sub-sub-sublease problem, they&#x27;d take startups on 1-year terms at a MUCH higher rate than established tenants who could negotiate modest discounts on longer-term leases.

But that leaves the problem of the actual  interview—the studies that I&#x27;ve seen test written resumes, because it&#x27;s possible to ensure that two resumes are identical except for one variable in ways that you can&#x27;t ensure that two interviews are identical. But it&#x27;s highly likely that the bias would carry over to any interaction with the candidates, though I don&#x27;t have any studies on hand that prove it.<p>2. Also agree that an objective method would be preferable, thanks for the link. Great read. IIRC, in the study I link in the third bullet point, forcing the person reviewing the resume to create a rubric before reading any of them greatly reduced the biased results. Having an objective process goes a long way. The point in the link about confident interviewers performing better in the traditional hiring process is definitely true, and also tied in a roundabout way to gender, funnily enough (women tend to be less confident than men: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/the-confidence-gap/359815/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/the-conf...</a>).<p>It&#x27;s definitely not the only problem—the pipeline is obviously skewed dramatically—but I don&#x27;t see any reason why tech workers would be exempt from the biases of the general population as they&#x27;ve been studied. Maybe the drive to hire more women would counteract it, like in your example—that&#x27;s the reasoning under which minority quotas are implemented, after all.

For instance, take a distributed Reddit where posts can be mappings, even by deferring the costs to the viewers in terms of small amounts of wei per view, it surely wouldn&#x27;t be enough to cover the expense of centralized permanent store (I understand Whisper is coming but it isn&#x27;t permanent enough).<p>I see a couple of Ehtereum frameworks out there using things IPFS for storage.

Write now, organize later, and use search to find stuff.<p>My setup is on OneNote, which does a really great job of indexing everything you throw into it.<p>- Start with one notebook, call it &quot;Work&quot; or &quot;Main&quot; or whatever. Put it on OneDrive or some other web-accessible location if you want (or don&#x27;t - OneNote may be proprietary, but it&#x27;s file-driven and you own your data). Create a section in it called &quot;Unfiled&quot;. Create another section called &quot;Unfiled Archive.&quot;<p>- Customize the system notification icon to create a new quick note when you click it.<p>- In OneNote Options > Save and Backup, set the Quick Notes Section to the Unfiled section you just created.<p>Need to jot something down? Click the notification area icon and you get a new note. Most of your day-to-day can live in the Unfiled section until you get a little down time, which you can use to organically sort and organize as you see fit. If something&#x27;s old and you&#x27;re not sure if you need it, drag it to the archive section. Over the years I have grown one huge notebook called &quot;Learning&quot; with tons of sections on every conceivable subject. My main &quot;Work&quot; notebook primarily consists of the Unfiled section plus a few others that have some long-lived stuff in them.<p>A few other OneNote-specific tips:<p>- Win+Shift+S freezes the display and lets you draw a bounding box to take a screenshot. I configure this to send the screenshot to the clipboard; super handy.<p>- OneNote has a printer driver. I print stuff to OneNote all the time.<p>- Interesting web pages have a habit of disappearing.

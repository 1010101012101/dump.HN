Both sites saw significant growth in 2011, but from my perspective, HN culture has been far more affected than SE. If you agree, do you attribute this to something specific that you are doing at Stack Exchange and is there something you would do differently to improve things here?<p>Some people discussed the situation on HN earlier today[1], but I think you bring a unique and valuable perspective to the issue. I have my own theory (i.e. <i>SE has a superior technical solution for reputation</i>)[2], but you have some of the most directly relevant experience.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3469453"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3469453</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3354171"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3354171</a>",1326765494

For example, since StackOverflow is primarily for concrete technical questions, overly subjective discussion questions are liable to get moved or closed; however, if you're interested in something <i>concrete</i> but still broad (e.g. how to use existential types), you're likely to be fine.<p>On programmers, on the other hand, most of the questions involve a good bit of discussion; the majority have several answers. This is because the focus of the site is different.<p>Finally, I think there's a lot of selection bias--you're more likely to remember closed questions, and the sort of questions that get shared on HN are the sort that don't really fit in StackOverflow.",1326764619

This also applies to their automobiles, appliances, etc.<p>In short, a lot of people out there have been hit with a newspaper on the nose (various times) for trying something new.<p>So, they decide to learn a new hobby (or craft), and they spend (waste) a lot of time fighting the fear of breaking things.<p>Yet, we (as in hackers) all know that one can't really do much harm to a computer with a simple approach such as the one used by CodeCademy. But non-hackers do not know that. They fear the machine (or the result of making a mistake with it (their files will be deleted! - plays in their mind)).<p>So, CodeCademy, I suggest you help people overcome such fear by showing them what they can do before showing them how to do it.<p>The terminal is fine, actually, I find that it was a genius idea. But, learning how to code is not bound to a terminal. It is bound to thinking, problem solving, abstractions. A learner cannot be afraid to break things, otherwise, they will not learn.<p>Challenge their fear (and ignorance) from the start. Instead of throwing them crumbs in the form of a simple string.length exercise, show them that they:<p>- cannot mess their computer up by playing with your website\n- will not get a virus\n- should try again if they fail at something\n- programming (not coding) takes time to learn<p>How will you do that?<p>I can point north, and tell you that Nirvana is that way, but I cannot walk the roads for you.<p>Sit back, and think about what I'm saying.<p>Help people learn how to code by helping them get over themselves.<p>I wish your team the very best;<p>code_pockets",1326764615

I mean, even as far as I've tried to isolate myself from civilization, and I've gone really far and given up almost all personal possessions to do that, I still feel the pull of the constant entertainment/what-next machine.<p>I probably don't have anything really smart to say in this, but I've noticed that the more survival shit I have to deal with, the less all of these things seem to matter.

The truth of the matter is knowing your value will get you your value.

Fuck no. But pretty soon after I finished it I had hundreds of hits from DHS, DoD, bases in Iraq, etc., and white unmarked Crown Vics were driving by my bungalow in the middle of the night.

When I went to San Fran after high school in '97, I had $1800 in savings and moved into the Hotel Nazareth, Jones & Geary, where the hookers next door and the crackheads on the street screaming kept me up all night. There was no phone. I walked to the Hilton every day in my fucking only suit, and used the payphones to call every single ad agency and design firm in the city. Went for an interview with Bear Magazine, which was terrifying (they offered me $33k, more than I make now, ironically) -- twelve giant hairy guys turning around to welcome you while you try to be interested in whether they're using Quark or Pagemaker. Took a job for $22k to spare my psychiatry bill, working for a bunch of douchebags doing web bubbgle 1.0 on Green Street.<p>Anyway, would I change in my time under the russian mob driving for bell cab?

The battle was entirely political, and armchair general troop movement stuff is completely beside the point.<p>Here's the fact:  Nobody wanted us there.

Like if we just killed enough of the bad guys, the rest of them would have given up?<p>That's not the way asymmetrical warfare works.  Every guy you kill has brothers and cousins who want to avenge him.  Losing the political battle is losing the war.  That's why we won in Iraq (Al Qaeda in Iraq were flown-in nihilists who alienated the population), and that's why we're losing in Afghanistan (the Taliban are a local movement with a local base).<p>You're seriously saying that had we invaded North Vietnam and bombed more stuff, it would have been fine?

To me, Fenn and Tom are two of the pioneers in the startup scene in Australia. I know that there were people in Australia doing startups before then, but for the current generation of new people doing startups they are an inspiration and the people we look up to.<p>When someone talks about YC in Australia, you can be sure that the name Adioso isn't too far off. I love using Adioso, even before I met Tom & Fenn. It such a cool idea and I still use it as my first point of call for looking for flights. If only they could keep adding more flights! I'm glad that they have gone back to open ended text search - that is what made them unique and easy to use.<p>As a user, you sometimes don't know where you want to go, BUT you want to go somewhere. You might know the origin destination and possibly the end destination, which makes Adioso great to use.<p>I also had an interview with an incubator in the US, and who do you turn to? The guys with the experience. So I asked Fenn for help which he was more than happy to assist with and he gave me some invaluable advice to prep me.<p>I'm sure these tough little cockroaches just won't die easily and they can figure it out.",1336446866

More scary activities.<p>As it stands, Facebook does what it does pretty well: gives people a place to communicate with each other. The walls of their interactions have a lot of holes, and you hear them complain, and you certainly see Facebook toe the line, but I think they've mastered that sport, especially as they approach 1 billion users.",1336446202

There are some social obstacles for regular cars, but once automated driving has proven itself it's only a matter of time until the shipping/delivery industry says ""wait I can have 24/7 drivers that have less accidents per million miles than the ones that can only do 11 hour days?"" Just this one case has crazy implications: 3.5 million jobs lost in a short time span, but you can order from amazon at 6pm and have at it your doorstep before you wake up, all of the trucks can drive at exactly optimal fuel efficiency, all businesses that rely on truckers will likely go under, do you need distribution centers when you have cheap, never sleeping drivers? this will take consume enormous amount of energy... and I'm sure you can think of more just for that one case.<p>Personally I think the biggest impact this will have is the energy usage one. Currently we stress about our abilities to meet future demands, but we aren't stressed enough to really innovate.  Automated driving will definitely change that.",1336446105

Robots fail only once. A single robot being programmed (""getting practice"") for a failure case is all robots getting that practice for a failure case. Also, robots are always vigilant and ready for failures, and are capable of doing emergency decisions in fractions of a second, before the humans would likely even know something is wrong.",1336446013

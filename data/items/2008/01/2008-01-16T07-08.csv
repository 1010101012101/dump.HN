While I can come up with tons of use cases, I honestly don't recall an actual visual image in m head of a laptop with 2+ USB devices connected at the same time. And the only time I see someone sticking a CD/DVD into a laptop is to watch a movie, which doesn't stop me from thinking about replacing my CD/DVD tray with an extra bay battery (ThinkPads rock).<p>And Duo 2 1.6Gz is too weak? That's just insane. Software has stagnated for at least 10 years, lagging behind hardware like crazy. What is that guy running today that he wasn't running 10 years ago? I have a CPU scaling frequency indicator in Gnome menu that 99.9% of the time shows me freaking 800Mz - yes, that's a typical frequency my 2.2Gz Duo 2 is running at.<p>The only time I wish I had a faster PC is when I do batch conversion of a bunch of RAW files from my camera. But it's like doing backups - pushing gigabytes around... And even that I am doing on my ""big"" PC where I need more screen real estate.<p>The only thing this laptop is missing is UltraNav found on ThinkPads. An enormous productivity/ergonomics booster, something that will keep pe glued to Lenovo forever.",1200470136

It's been inspiring to watch how they handle various issues as they grow, and yet try to keep the atmosphere.   Sure they've made some basic mistakes which can be criticized as ""unprofessional"", but any company can do so.  As the number of customers grow, you need to hire more staff and I think it gets difficult to keep the high standard.<p>When you start up a company, probably it consists of only smart people.  As you grow and you have to hire more staff, some junior, and it'd be getting difficult to for you to track what everyone is doing... how will you handle the situation?",1200469851

You're still getting an inferior experience to the guy with Blu-Ray, especially if he has a 1080p capable set.<p>That said, highly compressed 720p is still going to be an upgrade to a lot of people over a standard DVD. Perhaps only obsessives like me will care.",1200469809

Some people say the post is too light-hearted, a few say they're leaving, and another large group appreciated and enjoyed the post. It's hard to tell whether the result is a net gain or loss of business, but I certainly wouldn't be quick to say that it is definitely a bad thing.",1200468825

I'm looking at alternatives to using relational databases and information about how to avoid data corruption (features analogous to transactions) is scare.

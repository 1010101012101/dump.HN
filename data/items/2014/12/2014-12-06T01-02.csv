I am not in anyway speculating about what happened to Ezra.<p>That said, as a diabetic myself, I am answering this really only to your question, &quot;How can type 2 diabetes kill a person after only 1 year of being diagnosed? What the hell?&quot;<p>First - there is a very high correlation of age and aggression of disease progression within people with type 2 diabetes.  What I am saying here is, on average, the younger you are when diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, the higher the likely hood of early/severe complications.<p>Second - uncontrolled high blood sugars can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis which can be fatal.  This can come on very quickly.  Additionally; if a diabetic goes into diabetic ketoacidosis and pulls through they become at a much greater risk of having this happen again in the future.<p>Third - Dead in Bed Syndrome - This is the sudden death of a diabetic in their sleep and accounts for the deaths of 6% of all type 1 diabetics under age 40. This one is highly tied to Type 1 diabetes, but can also occur in Type 2 diabetic that require insulin therapy.<p>I&#x27;m terribly sorry to see him go and not for the Ruby/Rails or programming community that so looked up to him, but for his family and his son to him he will always be irreplaceable.",1417830954

Stabilization (from technical reliability POV) is all good and fine, but - for instance - is there a way to easily find out containers&#x27; names and links, and exact forwarded ports, from the API without regexping `docker ps` output and &quot;tcp/1234&quot;-like strings that should be meant for human eyes only? Is it still Docker&#x27;s official position that CLI is only official interface, and using HTTP API is frowned upon? Is all information about a container available in `docker inspect` or API equivalent, or do I still need to parse `docker ps` to find out about names and links? Does the registry/index mess ever going to go away, did it even make sense (other than vendor lock-in) at some point? Since Docker and registry API is HTTP, why can&#x27;t I use http auth (even implemented by an nignx proxy) instead of certs (which are fairly new) or centralized index for authentication? It should be as simple as using `<a href=""https://user:pass@IP/…`"" rel=""nofollow"">https://user:pass@IP/…`</a> URLs, what&#x27;s the problem with it? While we&#x27;re at it, why on Earth is HTTP Docker endpoint specified as `tcp://IP:PORT` rather than `<a href=""https://IP:PORT`"" rel=""nofollow"">https://IP:PORT`</a>, which would make it possible and easy to proxy, use http auth in an intuitive way, and <i>generally reflect how it works rather than obscure it</i>?

Just stumbled upon the following quote and read the corresponding article.<p>> Programming language comparisons usually focus on the brevity and expressiveness of the language. If the solution to a programming problem has fewer lines and is “easier to understand” or “clearer” in one language than another, that is an argument for using the former over the latter. This comparison is useful if one supposes that the art of programming is primarily concerned with writing programs. It isn’t, of course. It is mostly concerned with debugging programs.<p>- <a href=""https://codewords.hackerschool.com/issues/one/why-are-objects-so-hard-to-debug"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codewords.hackerschool.com/issues/one/why-are-object...</a><p>> In summary, then, every concept that object-orientation brings to the table makes debugging harder.
>  If you believe (as I do) that the majority of effort a programmer expends is devoted to finding and fixing bugs, then an imperative programming approach will be more efficient (in programmer time) than an object-oriented approach.",1417828507

Maybe in our home we&#x27;re just more selective grocery shoppers than most, but I would never use them for meat and even much produce. Meat, for example.. I&#x27;ve asked for boneless chicken breasts from the butcher and instead i&#x27;ve gotten prepackaged shrink-wrapped, and recently I requested a single double-cut beef tenderloin and instead got 2 single-cuts. In both cases, InstaCart made amends (50% refund) but I have a meal to cook: I don&#x27;t want a refund, I want what I ordered.<p>Another reason we couldn&#x27;t move totally to IC is how they handle credit cards. We get 6% cashback at grocery stores using the Amex Blue Cash card. (And have a 5% cashback Visa for the stores that don&#x27;t take Amex). Unfortunately, IC charges come thru as internet services, not grocery. So that&#x27;s a 6% price increase right off the top, in addition to mark-ups on products and delivery fees.<p>We purchased their &quot;prime&quot; and will continue to use the service, but i still have the dream of being able to replace all my in-store grocery shopping.",1417828343

Doesn&#x27;t &quot;a strict set of rules set by humans&quot; refer to the PageRank algo alongside rules for spammy content, nd rules like whether meta keywords are set, and so on, all the little rules that feed into deciding where a page that matches ranks in the resultset. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s tweakable by engineers..?<p>&quot;The Knowledge Graph is just a way of encoding the world&#x27;s structure.&quot; Precisely. Very well said. &quot;The world may reveal its structures to our neural networks, given enough time, data and processing power.&quot; But that&#x27;s the point, NNs don&#x27;t have to perform this uncovering because we do the hard work for them in the form of Wikidata and Freebase and what have you. I don&#x27;t get what you think is brittle about this.<p>I was referring to the very recent article[1] by Gary Marcus, I need to quote a good chunk:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;To anyone who knows their history of cognitive science, two people ought to be really pleased by this result: Steven Pinker, and myself. Pinker and I spent the 1990’s lobbying — against enormous hostility from the field — for hybrid systems, modular systems that combined associative networks (forerunners of today’s deep learning) with classical symbolic systems. This was the central thesis of Pinker’s book Words and Rules and the work that was at the core of my 1993 dissertation. Dozens of academics bitterly contested our claims, arguing that single, undifferentiated neural networks would suffice. Two of the leading advocates of neural networks famously argued that the classical symbol-manipulating systems that Pinker and I lobbied for were not “of the essence of human computation.”&quot;&quot;<p>For Marcus the symbolic system in AlphaGo _is_ Monte Carlo Tree Search. I&#x27;m saying that for the so-called Semantic Web the symbolic system is the Knowledge Graph. This Steven Levy article[2] from Jan. 2015 put the queries that evoke it at 25% back then. I figure it&#x27;s more now and growing slowly, alongside the ML of RankBrain.<p>[1] <a href=""https://backchannel.com/has-deepmind-really-passed-go-adc85e256bec#.buzg3l31l"" rel=""nofollow"">https://backchannel.com/has-deepmind-really-passed-go-adc85e...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://backchannel.com/how-google-search-dealt-with-mobile-33bc09852dc9#.ty3qr8b4l"" rel=""nofollow"">https://backchannel.com/how-google-search-dealt-with-mobile-...</a>",1454741590

The other 3D package mentioned are therefore easy to use without reading a manual or tutorial. Everyone who used one of those programs can easily switch to another one.<p>Blender UI with it&#x27;s non standard might be productive for certain professionals who invested considerable amount of time.

Do you need to have both vesting and buyout provisions, or is vesting preferential to buyouts, or do you not need vesting with a sane buyout policy?",1185122732

He's even said something to that effect: part of his advice to me was to make sure I can setup a corporate structure that'll survive the departure of founders or key employees, because things do go wrong, and the company is his dream.  Perhaps there's a lesson in there: don't let your identity get so wrapped-up in your company that it becomes only <i>your</i> company, one where other people don't feel like they have a chance to make a difference in it.  Come to think of it, I've heard similar things from other (failed) entrepreneurs.<p>You're right though: I guess I just need to go with my gut.

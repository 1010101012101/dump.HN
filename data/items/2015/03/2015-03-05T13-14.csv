You don&#x27;t tell a joke like that where there is even a small chance unintended people will here it.<p>But a lame joke based on &quot;dongle&quot; sounding like a dirty word? That&#x27;s a joke that could be told on a children&#x27;t show on TV and not even draw complaints from parents in the Bible Belt.<p>This kind of humor is acceptable for a general family audience on prime time television. For instance, in The Simpsons episode &quot;Bart, the Mother&quot;, Bart raises a pair of lizards that are an illegal invasive species, and Skinner is explaining why they must be killed.<p>Skinnner: It&#x27;s already wiped out the Dodo, the Cuckoo, and the Ne-Ne, and it has nasty plans for the Booby, the Titmouse, the Woodcock, and the Titpecker.<p>Similarly, in the episode &quot;You Kent Always Say What You Want&quot;, where Kent Brockman says a very nasty swear word on live TV, and apparently has gotten away with it.<p>Grampa Simpson:  I can&#x27;t believe Kent Brockman got away with it. Back in my day TV stars couldn&#x27;t say boobie, tushie, burp, fanny burp, water closet, underpants, dingle dangle, Boston marriage, LBJ, Titicaca, hot dog or front lumps!<p>Heck, I could easily see a &quot;big dongle&quot; joke being told on NPR on a Saturday morning by Garrison Keillor during the annual &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot; joke show (which is hilarious, BTW).<p>If your reaction to overhearing such a joke is anything more than rolling your eyes at the childish humor, your offensiveness sensor needs recalibration. I&#x27;ve heard that getting a pet can bring calmness and help you recalibrate. A bird could be a good low maintenance pet for this. I recommend a Titpecker.",1425563880

Moving the goalposts does not help clarify the reasoning nor refute the point about haecceity.<p>That a person cannot tell two things apart is also accidental for the mediaeval philosopher. God can. Omniscience gets us the Locational history. Of course this means the universe contains three things: two spheres and God. That would be a given for any public opinions expressed by Scotus or his contemporaries.<p>The obvious move to defeat Haecceity is to postulate a universe with two Gods. Alas, the medieval philosophy logically precludes this: Two omnipotentencies is a contradiction and the Council of Nicea dogmaticcally solved that a millennium before Scotus&#x27;s time.<p>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying then yes we are saying the same thing.",1425563866

And somehow, this is supposed to be OK? Why? Because she&#x27;s part of certain minorities, as she&#x27;s so keen to point out (jewish, black)? Because of her gender?<p>If a &quot;white male&quot; had done anything like this, how do you think the world would have reacted?

Maybe he secretly seeded the hate groups.&quot; - Without giving any kind of tentative evidence, she&#x27;s accusing him of funding hate groups, and downplaying her fault in his bad fortunes.<p>- She claims she feared for her life after hearing Hank make a silly forking joke. In a crowded audience, she thought he was going to kill her, right there. What the hell is that about?<p>- Quote: &quot;Hank’s actions resulted in him getting fired, yet he framed it in a way to blame me. If I had two kids, I wouldn’t tell ‘jokes’&quot; - Seriously, if every father who ever told a mate a poor joke with some sexual innuendo were to get fired, we&#x27;d all be out of a job. Let him who is without sin throw the first stone.<p>- She snarkily claims that Hank is devoid of sympathy or empathy towards other human beings, while ironically being incapable herself of empathizing with his plight. She just goes on to repeat that all of this is his fault, including both of them losing their job, and all the threats she has received.<p>- It also sounds (especially at the end) like she blames him personally for being born into an unfair world, where he was born with more privilege and opportunity than her, but that&#x27;s bringing us a bit to far off topic.",1425562713

It is binary:you are a good person or you are a bad person. All this based on the myth fully internalized by both Paul Graham and Jessica herself that she can just judge character. They don&#x27;t even care to try to understand it, they just assume she has this superpower and we all shall trust it.<p>My point is not being a good person doesn&#x27;t matter on building companies. I too firmly believe it does. A &quot;fraternity of good people&quot; can be very powerful. I try to keep close to myself only good people, including doing business. I also mentally veto bad people that could possibly give me good business. But I don&#x27;t judge them on character so quickly and so often.<p>A recurrent topic here in HN is how language limit and direct thought. In english the verb &quot;to be&quot; is used in two situations that are very different, and you can realize that if you speak a latin language. Myself, I speak portuguese, and we use to different verbs to translate &quot;to be&quot;. We use &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot;. &quot;Ser&quot; is for something more permanent. &quot;Estar&quot; is for something more transitory.<p>So when in english you say &quot;Your friend is ugly&quot;, you can tell is you judge the people as ugly for life, I mean, he just isn&#x27;t handsome, he is ugly, he must accept it. Or if you are actually meaning that he is ugly right now. He chose the wrong outfit, the wrong haircut for him or that simply he isn&#x27;t as astonishing as he use to be. To mean that you must add a time stamp, like &quot;Your friend is ugly today&quot;. So this phrasing and using of the verb &quot;to be&quot; in english nudge you to a very binary way of thinking. And people&#x27;s character are not binary. Jessica might vet a very good person as being bad, just because in the day of the interview they were pissed that they found out that an ex has cheated all relationship and they were feeling more beligerant and raging than usual. And that was judged by Jessica&#x27;s superpowers as &quot;being bad people&quot;.<p>All great arguments for culture and atmosphere were lost to me because of this judgemental stand.",1425562361

Bullshit. Her Victorian sensibilities were offended over a crass joke. And now she&#x27;s engaging in histrionics after the fact to justify her response.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m really sick and tired of the pervasive image in America that all men are rapists and child molesters. You talk to a woman on an elevator, or you accidentally make eye contact with a child that isn&#x27;t yours for a brief second, and everyone assumes you&#x27;re a sexual predator because penis.

I would never attempt to deny that there is a systemic patriarchy in place, or that white privilege exists, but tying every perceived injustice in the world to these braoder issues undermines the real issues that affect millions of people on a daily basis. As has been pointed out here by many other commentors, the behaviour of Hank and his friend was clearly outside conference guidelines and their being reprimanded for it is absolutely correct. Attempting to tie that to some sense of white (no race element to this story at all), male enitlement is absurd and frankly does a disservice to both the civil rights and feminist movements. When humour is made at the expense of a person in a position of relative weakness it is wrong. When she overheard someone else&#x27;s (admittedly unfunny but by no means directly offensive to any race/gender/sexual orientation)joke and took offense then that was her personal reaction. Making her displeasure known to conference organisers was absolutely within her remit but turning herself into some sort of &#x27;crusader&#x27; for a vague idea of &#x27;rights and justice&#x27; in a public forum is problematic for me. Your article has done exactly that, by &#x27;casually&#x27; mentioning the use of smart phones in the Ferguson case you are obviously attempting to equate what was, let&#x27;s be honest, a minor case of a clash of senses of humour to the killing of a young man by the police. That is despicable. You then go on to mention the race of Lindsey Stone, despite the fact that it has no relevance to the case which she became known for. This sort of linking of every case of offensive public behaviour with what are real, and long running, issues of race and gender equality serve only to perpetuate a mentality of &#x27;us and them&#x27; and undermine real cases of racism and sexism that still occur around the world on a regular basis.",1425561316

It looks like &quot;theseness&quot; to me. :/<p>On a more serious note, the property that makes it so that one sphere is itself but is not the other is generally conceived of counterfactually. If I were to enter that universe and stand on one of the spheres, I would immediately suffocate. But, the sphere playing host to my corpse would be easily distinguishable from the other sphere. Similarly, it&#x27;s easy to imagine scratching the surface of one of the spheres -- it seems unlikely, in that hypothetical world, that a symmetrical scratch would simultaneously develop on the opposed sphere.<p>Assuming the spheres are in a conventional three-dimensional space, and that they are not perfectly uniform but contain irregularities at the atomic level, then they will necessarily be distinguishable from each other. All that&#x27;s necessary is to look at their orientation to each other. Every atom in one sphere will correspond to an identical atom in the other sphere. But if they are &quot;identical&quot; in an absolute, 3-dimensional coordinates sense, then the atom on &quot;sphere 1&quot; (without loss of generality ;) ) that&#x27;s closest to sphere 2 will correspond to the atom on sphere 2 that is farthest from sphere 1, which is an asymmetry. If they&#x27;re mirrored, such that the closest atom on sphere 1 to sphere 2 corresponds to the closest atom to sphere 1 on sphere 2, then they are distinguishable from each other by reference to the euclidean arrangement of corresponding sets of atoms. (To say this another way, you&#x27;d have to rotate one of them to get it to be identical in terms of euclidean positioning -- or if they&#x27;re really mirrored, it might be impossible to rotate one such that it matched the other in terms of euclidean positioning, which is a major difference.)<p>If this hypothetical universe actually contained nothing but two perfectly uniform iron spheres, we could say a couple of things:<p>1. Sure, there&#x27;s no real method of distinguishing one sphere from the other sphere. But,<p>2. This universe does not obey the same physical laws as our universe, so there&#x27;s no real reason to expect it to have the same haecceic properties.<p>3. Furthermore, there are no lessons to be drawn from the two-iron-spheres universe that can be sensibly applied to the universe we live in.",1425561176

And one that would fall apart under its own brittleness quite quickly.

Laws will always have some ambiguity, values precede laws and thus there are &#x27;just&#x27; actions that go against the written law, interpretation is a necessity in human matters, the legal system evolves with the changes in the world and can never be all-encompassing, Judges have at least some training in these matters, language is ambiguous and evolves and is the medium of law, etc.<p>And fwiw, it sounds like the &#x27;joke&#x27; was actually a statement about the public markets, and produced evidence to show that the automated trading systems we have can be destabilizing. This evidence, in the form of a joke, is memorable, and can be recalled and used by people during a time that they may be building consensus or making decisions around these matters. And then those decisions may become laws, superseding the ones you&#x27;re interested in enforcing.

I think these gentle reminders by peers in practice will whip everyone into a frenzy of hunting for negativity, naming negativity, blaming for negativity, being defensive about negativity, judging and feeling judged, anger, outrage and despair with constant accusations and counter accusations about the definition of negativity.<p>Some negativity is normal and natural and okay.  HN wants less of it, so they should just ask people to make their own self assessment of their post <i>at the moment of posting</i>.

I can be the cynic and &quot;think critically&quot; and think you&#x27;re just trying to come up with justifications for your snide remark after the fact. OR I can be charitable and believe that you&#x27;re being honest, and really were trying to not be negative/overly cynical and instead acting as a reminder.<p>What you&#x27;ll notice is that in your original comment you were not charitable to dang. He made a very clear statement that this change was not a reply to a specific comment. And your reply to that is effectively &quot;you&#x27;re not trustworthy&quot;. You are reinforcing this last point in your most recent reply by reiterating that dang&#x27;s &quot;job is to censor comments ...&quot;. Inferring that someone is untrustworthy is the opposite of being charitable, and falls squarely into &quot;negative&quot; territory.<p>You may feel that &quot;calling someone out&quot; and thus reminding people to &quot;think critically&quot; justifies the negativity of calling someone untrustworthy, but it doesn&#x27;t. If you can&#x27;t demonstrate how dang has shown himself to be untrustworthy, then all you&#x27;re doing is slinging mud. If you know of an incident where he&#x27;s been untrustworthy, then the constructive thing would be to say &quot;Unfortunately I don&#x27;t really believe you dang because you&#x27;ve proven yourself to be untrustworthy [here, here and here].&quot;<p>And if your base reason for adding the comment is to remind people to &quot;think critically&quot; how patronizing is that to everyone that reads that? Why are you making the assumption that we&#x27;re not thinking critically? Why do you feel it&#x27;s your role to make sure that us readers are thinking critically?<p>Do you see the inherent arrogance in your comment, and thus how that adds to its negativity?<p>I think a corollary to the &quot;don&#x27;t be gratuitously negative&quot; guideline, is &quot;don&#x27;t write as if you know better than everybody else&quot;",1428104739

I meant this in a broader context than errors. As a simple example, manual memory management exposes more details than GC. There are many languages that care dearly about errors, as you&#x27;ve rightfully pointed out.<p>I broadly agree with the rest of your post. Error handling is hard and tedious, and programmers don&#x27;t like doing it. I myself had an embarrassing bug in `rustbook` where I did `let _ =`. I only intended to start off that way!

The last three languages I&#x27;ve learned to fluency have all, in various ways, been very concerned about errors: Erlang, Haskell, and Go. Yes, they have widely varying opinions about what to do with them, but they all agree that you have to be fairly constantly worried about them. You can&#x27;t sweep them under the rug; you need a strategy, and you need to deal with the resulting issues head on.<p>Despite their differences, what I feel like I&#x27;ve learned from them is that historically speaking, the vast majority of popular languages and their communities have been downright cavalier about errors. It&#x27;s often in all the little details rather than a consistent, stated design goal, but the presence of various nils and nulls, APIs that will happily return empty strings for paths instead of errors, and all kinds of APIs and libraries that seem to be subconsciously written with the belief that returning an error is a failure on the part of the library and will go to what now seem to me to be absurd lengths to somehow keep klunking along in the presence of already-manifested failure. Even for languages that think they&#x27;re being really good with exceptions, I find that when I go back to them, they end up using the exception support to &quot;permit&quot; themselves to be sloppy and hope the exceptions will pick up the pieces... and they often don&#x27;t. Not because of some theoretical weakness, but because allowing developers to think they don&#x27;t have to think about the error cases means precisely that they don&#x27;t!<p>People are used to errors not poking them in the face until deploy time. It seems to me there&#x27;s a strong, broad motion towards developing languages that will in one way or another force you to deal with them at compile time. It&#x27;s a culture shock for people, but, I&#x27;ll tell you this, get really good at Rust or any of these other languages and go back to any of those other languages, and you will find your code changes in those other languages to suddenly look a lot more like your Rust does anyhow, which means this putative disadvantage of Rust evaporates anyhow. Once you see how sloppy you were being, it&#x27;s hard to go back in good conscience.",1428102866

Used for large distributed mission critical systems.<p>I think there&#x27;re at least these problems with Haskell:<p>* The language is badly designed. See the number of extensions which aren&#x27;t standardized but widely used. See also obvious problems such as requirement to use renames when importing code, and problem with record names conflicts which isn&#x27;t solved for years.<p>* The focus of the language isn&#x27;t correct. Lazy evaluations creates a lot of problems both in program performance and complexity of the compiler. The most important parts are pureness and side effect control.<p>* The language is already obsolete. Many its constructions and related complexities are redundant if we unify type and expression level, and get as a result dependently typed system.<p>I hope some language in the future will implement these ideas, and we will have a widely used pure functional dependently typed language with explicit control of effects.<p>I see two candidates for such a language:<p>* Pure script - it&#x27;s Haskell done right, compiledd to JS. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t support dependent types.<p>* Idris - it&#x27;s the language which I describe, but I fear that it&#x27;s impossible to create a widely used commercial language without major industry players&#x27; support.",1428102167

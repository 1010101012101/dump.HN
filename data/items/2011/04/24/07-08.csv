It is typically used when the context that the pointer is\n  currently a child of is going to be freed and you wish to keep the\n  memory for a longer time.\n\n  NOTE: It is possible to produce loops in the parent/child relationship\n  if you are not careful with talloc_steal(). No guarantees are provided\n  as to your sanity or the safety of your data if you do this.\n</code></pre>\nThere's also talloc_reparent where you explicitly choose the parent to change.",1303631719

2478482,comment,2477758,2478325,5,0,FooBarWidget,,,"No offense intended, but I have to say I was a little bit disappointed by halloc. I expected it to use a custom allocation scheme, like malloc()ing large chunks of memory in one go in order to reduce malloc() time and space overhead and to increase locality of reference. Instead it looks like it just malloc()s every object separately. I'm sure some people will find halloc useful, but in my C++ project where I already use smart pointers I didn't see any advantage in using halloc.<p>It doesn't look like talloc is any better.",1303631617

His views are radical, and toning his messages to make them more palatable down would be dishonest to who he is.

As a matter of fact, asking for investment is a sure fire sign investors look for...to know when to pass.  Investors invest, people that know their ass from their elbow in your field advise.  Once you start showing your product and explaining your vision for the next steps...preferably with some user data, investors will ask if you are looking to raise money (if they are interested) and potential mentors will ask what they can do to help you out.

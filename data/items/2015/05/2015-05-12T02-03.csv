9529318,comment,9524536,9527612,0,0,uxp,,,"That&#x27;s good for you, and I fully support your decision, but I wish to posit an argument about Sony and their numerous &quot;debacles&quot; over the past decade starting from the CD Rootkit.<p>Do you remember when Sony went after GeoHot, George Hotz, and fail0verflow for his and their reverse engineering of the PS3 and the outrage and virtual pitchforks that were raised with others touting that they too would never purchase a SCEA/SCEI product again?<p>Remember even more outrage that was raised after PSN went down and it was revealed just how incompetent their internal network security was and how they allegedly stored unencrypted user information and used significantly insecure and broken cryptographic hashing algorithms?<p>In both instances, people said that they were done with Sony. Yet, the Xbox One has had significantly less adoption than the Sony PS4. Please note, I&#x27;m not going to argue that the people that said that they were no longer purchasing Sony products are the very same people that bought a PS4 over an Xbox One, but I am arguing that these people had a minuscule to nonexistent effect on the overall repercussions against Sony as to not matter.<p>Searching for &quot;Xbox One PS4 Sales&quot; brings up hundreds of articles ranging from just after launch up to this very day with month-by-month numbers landing from a 1.4 million unit difference in January of 2014, to a 1.7 million difference between the PS4 and Xbox One in the second quarter of 2014, and estimates at that time of 9 million PS4s sold globally versus 5 million for the Xbox One. An article from October of 2014 pegs the PS4 at a 40% lead over the Xbox One. This is a significant difference. Apparently, no one else cares how draconian or insecure a company treats their data, because only a few people remember the short term disasters over the long term entertainment value they receive from the products produced by these companies.",1431399490

For me, it breaks down to neurons & symbols, well-known scientific domains. While I may not be right, it&#x27;s not difficult to come up with plausible explanations for the phenomena humans experience. Most of the mystery comes from it being very difficult for most people to even define consciousness. Much of the syntax we have for it (in the west, at least) is cobbled together from various religions, spiritualities, and extremely, extremely dense philosophers read by few and understood by fewer.<p>You might find Richard Hofstadter&#x27;s Book &quot;I Am A Strange Loop&quot; illuminating if you find my explanation meager.",1431399135

The staff can answer questions about the car, but not about purchasing (pricing, financing, etc). If you want to buy one, they direct you to visit teslamotors.com.<p>In no case are people in a state prevented from buying a Tesla car. The buying experience is the same everywhere: go to teslamotors.com, configure and order a car, and either pick it up or have it delivered to you after it&#x27;s been manufactured.<p>As for the legal aspect, the federal government does have the ability to regulate interstate commerce, and federal law preempts state law. When there is no federal law, however, the states are free to regulate in that area.

The NMADA (New Mexico Automobile Dealers Assocation) has made sure there are laws on the books that make it impossible for Tesla to not only open a store in the state, but also they can&#x27;t open a service center.  Even though on Tesla&#x27;s own website it shows a map with a &quot;Coming Soon&quot; icon for a service center in Albuquerque, it really isn&#x27;t coming any time soon because the law forbids Tesla from opening a service center.  So owners in New Mexico are kinda screwed.  Some of them don&#x27;t even realize it.  If you are a Tesla owner in NM, and you need service some day, you have to call Tesla and have a service person come from either Phoenix, AZ or Denver, CO -- 7+ hours away by interstate. And if your car has to be taken back to one of those service centers, you&#x27;re looking at significant expense because of the flatbed transportation. Not to mention hassle.<p>All this to protect a bunch of sleazy old boy network car dealers who don&#x27;t want Tesla educating the New Mexico public about how bad they have it with dealerships and service centers.<p>I wish the FTC would talk about the service angle as well.",1431399055

Obviously this means there will always be a larger percentage of scammers here than normal. The other big issue with the community driven method is that people can&#x27;t really take their lumps with a temp ban. Make one bad decision and it will haunt you<p>As people spend more and more time inside virtual worlds the natural progression is for people to trade in-game items for cash. If someone could make rent just playing WoW and selling items, there in-game time would skyrocket! Unfortunately game companies are pretty against this with the only real exception being Valve.<p>The biggest argument against cash trading is that it ruins the markets for &#x27;normal&#x27; players who don&#x27;t want to grind gold. Markets in general are hard but throwing in the requirement that they also have to be fun makes the challenge extremely difficult. Competing against bots just ruins the market aspect of the game for most players.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is but I think a core issue is that most companies don&#x27;t think of structuring the game around the economy and item entropy. This leads to weird inefficiencies and massive inflation when players and bots alike start grinding gold heavily. The only game that really comes close to fixing this issue is EVE Online. Their market is fairly well built and expensive items can disappear in an instant making runaway inflation not as much of an issue (though still very present).<p>It&#x27;s an annoying problem from the traders prospective because fraud runs rampant and there isn&#x27;t a ton we can do. Sites like mine help raise the bar required to scam large amounts of money but without the game companies support it will always be an ongoing battle.",1431398235

The issue is you couldn&#x27;t <i>charge end-users</i> 1000x more for it, or even 10x more for it, so it doesn&#x27;t make any sense for private actors to build: ISPs can&#x27;t reasonably capture value generated in the economy at large.<p>From what I&#x27;m told, the US built much of its actual fiber-miles count in the late 1990&#x27;s when projections were that bandwidth usage would grow exponentially for a long time, and we were &quot;running out&quot; (with a high profit margin on each small step forward to add to the supply).  Then we figured out how to do wavelength division multiplexing and all of a sudden an existing fiber could carry 100x more information.  This led to the existing players going bankrupt, and the &quot;Dark fiber&quot; era, ten years of overshoot before we started digging fiber lines again domestically on a large scale.<p>This oversupply enabled the Internet in the US to blossom.  Last-mile issues were all that existed for the longest time.  If we had spent that decade bottlenecked for lack of backbone & backhaul bandwidth, constantly bumping into saturation of the existing links and frenzied construction of new links, the Internet would be a very different place.  A more metered place, with a very high degree of rent-seeking by the existing players, and a lot of bandwidth-intensive web ideas killed in their cradles.<p>Apparently in some other developed countries that joined the Internet scene after this boom & bust, the government made it a priority to provide both backbone and last-mile connectivity on an infrastructural basis without much regard to profit, to even better success than the US.",1431397736

9529141,comment,9528531,9528531,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"Great work guys, but correct me if I am wrong but it seems the reasons you decided to build Deku (if I am understanding what you have written) did not seem to be anything other than you were not a fan of how React doesn&#x27;t take a completely functional approach to building components. Is that an appropriate assumption to make based on what you have written in your article?<p>I feel a little disappointed to be honest. Because as I was reading, I was expecting to read that you somehow had created a dom-diffing algorithm and matching library that was more performant than React.js, but really it just came down to the fact you didn&#x27;t like how React.js looks. I was rooting for you from the beginning, expecting to see someone had created something superior to the much hyped React, but it didn&#x27;t happen.<p>I don&#x27;t want to hate on what you&#x27;ve done, looking through the code reveals that you put some considerable effort into Deku, but it makes me wonder if that effort could have been spent on perhaps learning the inner-workings of React.js and adapting it to your needs in its own fork. But having said that, Deku to me only has a few slight differences to React.js, the way components are built in Deku in comparison to React.js doesn&#x27;t appear to be that dramatically different.<p>I don&#x27;t want this comment to come across as yet another cynical HN commenter, but I just cannot see anything comprehensively different to existing solutions. I hate seeing talented development hours going to waste that could have been used to make an already existing project better.",1431396101

But there&#x27;s only so much you can do to reign in the chaos of the bazaar.<p>The Docker workflow certainly has its merits.  It&#x27;s great for narrowing dev-prod parity and repeatability.

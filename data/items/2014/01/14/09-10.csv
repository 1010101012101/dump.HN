7056145,comment,7054975,7054975,3,0,alan_cx,,,"I see PC sales, as they have been, as a sort of blip bubble, which happened while proper simple consumer devices were developed. Now we have such devices, PCs are less and less necessary for day to day uses. So, as time goes on the PC sales should shrink back to the people that actually need them. But then the problem there is that PCs would become more expensive since the volumes go down massively.<p>My experience has been like that. 20 (these number are very guessed) years ago, no one cared. 15 years ago people began to get interested. 10 years ago, everyone in my house had to have a PC. Now, most of us use tablets or phones, but we still have 2 PCs that get used when tablets are not appropriate. I personally use a PC 95% of the time. One of my kids who is a heavy gamer uses his PC 99% of the time. The rest of the house, however, use tablets 95% of the time. All those old PC are now gone. (Much better round the house now, less desk space and wire required. Mrs Me is now much happier!! Also, less power consumed. Less noise, less heat.)<p>The bit that bothers me is that back when all my kids used PCs, they nosed around the machine and discovered things like programming. Using a tablet is so focused, that natural discovery is lost. The tablet is just a thing they to use to consume. Another problem is that if a tablet user asks about how to program, they have to leave the tablet that they are used to and have to sit at this big PC box thing, which is for them a whole mental shift, and is there for possibly off putting.<p>But overall it seems to me that PC sales will and should decline in favour of tablets because PCs are OTT for the task of consuming the internet. Game wise, consoles are over all easier to use.<p>Using a PC is or was like using an aircraft carrier instead of a speed boat, until someone invented the speed boat. Now most people buy speed boats, and the navy can have their carriers back!!!!",1389691943

7056088,comment,7055923,7055923,5,0,steve_barham,,,"There is a detailed analysis of the feasibility of such systems in general on the following web page:<p><a href""http://www.nigelhewitt.co.uk/diving/rant/#gill"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.nigelhewitt.co.uk/diving/rant/#gills</a><p>Quote (following an explanation of the quantity of oxygen in solution in sea water at depth, vs. quantities required to breath, yielding a requirement of 2000L/minute of water to be processed):<p>&quot;This raises three problems in my mind.<p>&quot;Firstly is size. If the magic box is a reasonable size, say a volume of working water is the size of my scuba tank it will have 12L of water to work on at any one moment. So 2000L/minute means that the water must be in, processed and out in 12*60/2000 seconds. That&#x27;s just over one third of a second to complete the whole process.<p>&quot;Secondly there is the fact that 2000L/minute worries me when I consider that my old 20HP outboard had an 20cm diameter prop on it. To move 2000L/minute it would have to knock the water through at 2000/31.4=63m/s, otherwise 142mph in old numbers. So my second problem is that this is a huge amount of thrust for a diver who does not wish to zoom about like a torpedo and the third problem is that that sort of power isn&#x27;t going to come from ordinary batteries.&quot;<p>Personally, I read the article as a typical design student &#x27;concept&#x27; piece; certainly, if I were a battery manufacturer that had a product 30x more energy dense than the competition, which charged 1000x faster, I would not be looking at the scuba market to make my billions.",1389690650

You can&#x27;t build any of these products well without knowing (deeply and certainly) users&#x27; patterns. Microsoft has no realistic way of knowing when it routes you to the wrong place...no continuous training data to let it feed and refine a personal assistant. Data products can be cool demos (see Siri) from a startup, but without both the starting dataset and the continuous feedback that you get by deploying these against real users <i>and</i> capturing the resulting behavior, I think they are quite limited. Continuous adaptation and learning is as important as the initial algorithm.<p>And while I certainly am looking into the future when I talk about cornering the market, I think it&#x27;s an interesting question to ask how you compete against a company like Google that starts with this much user context. How can you build better experiences when they have the advantage in data, ML expertise, and the raw computational power? The incremental acquisitions of data and companies are not the issue...it&#x27;s the web of connections that is valuable. And Google is not only trouncing Apple, their only meaningful competitor, in that race...Google is pulling even further ahead.",1389690435

68277,comment,68075,68265,0,0,ardit33,,,"It is very bloated.  Typical Java style.  Too much XML (or anotattions), lots of ""magic"" happening, without you knowing what's going on.  For complicated joins, you are much better off with just SQL  (maybe using some utilities like Jakarta's DButil).  <p>Hibernate is just another complexity with a steep curve, and it's propertary stuff to learn  (HQL ?).<p>If you must do a ORM, I like Apache's Cayenne.  It comes with a very nice utility, which creates everything for you. Much simpler than Hibernate.<p>Overrall I'd rather not use java.  Python seems a much better fit for web development, thou it's most popular framework, Django, suffers a lot of the same stuff as Rails.<p>And Ruby is an ugly language.  Too perl-ish.",1192488696
68276,comment,68075,68243,0,0,davidw,,,"I have a different take on Rails.  It's actually something that has attracted a lot of interest from Java people sick of writing too much code, as well as scripting language people who want something that's relatively clean, that basically utilizes a lot of best practices in one bundle.<p>I like it a lot, and do not consider myself one of the ""crap producing PHP crowd"".<p>Also, how can you equate Ruby to PHP?  They're very different in terms of philosophy and design.  Ruby has all kinds of nice language features that make it a pleasure to use.  PHP basically borrows things from here and there, and was never a very ""inspired"" programming language.",1192488676

68271,comment,68142,68142,0,0,karzeem,,,"Young people are doing a lot of stuff that could one day be considered ""enterprise"" software; it's just that the suits that buy these things don't trust them yet.<p>PG mentions this in his essay on colleges (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/colleges.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/colleges.html</a>):<p>""There used to be a saying in the corporate world: 'No one ever got fired for buying IBM.' You no longer hear this about IBM specifically, but the idea is very much alive; there is a whole category of 'enterprise' software companies that exist to take advantage of it. People buying technology for large organizations don't care if they pay a fortune for mediocre software. It's not their money. They just want to buy from a supplier who seems safe--a company with an established name, confident salesmen, impressive offices, and software that conforms to all the current fashions. Not necessarily a company that will deliver so much as one that, if they do let you down, will still seem to have been a prudent choice. So companies have evolved to fill that niche.""<p>Companies used to buy mainframes, because they saw simpler machines as toy computers.  Even today, big companies might write a web app in Java when they could write it much more easily in Python, because they see Python et al. as toy languages.  Similarly, there are a lot of apps out there, and there will soon be many more, that the market will one day force companies to stop labeling as toys.",1192488179
68270,comment,67934,68226,0,0,cstejerean,,,"The problem is that if it is ever sold the community will likely migrate away (unless the company buying manages to keep the same open and democratic feeling to it). I'm also curious what the potential for advertising on Wikipedia is. I think throwing up adds on Wikipedia would reduce it's encyclopedic nature to people. Not to mention that Wikipedia has received ridiculously large donations from large companies and that would no longer be true if it got bought out, so the actual costs of running it would probably be really high.",1192487899

68263,comment,67584,67593,0,0,rms,,,"You say this like the United States doesn't engage in its own brand of evil. China is certainly quantitatively worse in terms of executions and human rights abuses but both governments commit atrocities as part of a very rational attempt to maintain power.<p>In China, this requires the government to be somewhat authoritarian because the government and the people (except for the people of Tibet and Taiwan) want One China. It is only a very recent thing that all of China has been united and in the long term China will be incredibly powerful just by virtue of being one prosperous, populous nation. If China were to convert to democracy and allow free thought overnight, the economy is likely to collapse just like the Soviet Union. This is the model of sudden ideological change that China looks to.<p>In the long run, China will become more free. Hu Jintao has made a lot of progress and will only do more now that his power base is completely solidified at the current People's 5 Yearly Conference. His Tsinghua Clique (graduates of China's preeminent engineering university, their equivalent of MIT) might even be more competent leaders than the businessmen and lawyers that run America.",1192487297

The title says it all. It is designed to be the jumping off point for right-wing attackers. <p>Am I a believer? Yes, In science! Link to a science based  article questioning the conventional wisdom of climate change? Fine. Great. All for it. Bring it on. Let's debate.  But lazily link to a piece of sensationalized right-wing propaganda when this feed should be primarily about news related to the world of computers and computer science and I feel the best response is parody. <p>If gibsonf1 hates Al Gore and buys into the perverted slander built up by his political opponents and the Washington Beltway establishment, thats fine too.

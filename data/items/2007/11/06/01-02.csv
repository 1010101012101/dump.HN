This increased usage of the core products will continue to drive the growth in an organic way. <p>I don't know that there is any lock-in, Google docs allow you to freely export your files.  This new Android looks to provide a browser that you aren't forced to use Google with.<p>I really liked the Android announcement.  Getting into the cell phone market directly would be a huge risk for Google, they do not have the expertise in the hardware and manufacturing business they would require.  So they made the best move I have seen in a while, they decided to make the massive partnerships and develop a platform that they could leverage many phone maker's business.",1194313956

Their general strategy right now is to reduce costs since the money coming in is lower than expected and dropping.<p>Userplanes is an example of a product that sounds great, could have been great, and then was crippled, underused and never delivered what it could have.<p>But isn't it interesting to see such a giant fall?

The benchmarks may or may not reflect an increased performance advantage for a Rails app. <p>Or at the very least, be able to compile a Rails app into bytecode for commercial distribution.

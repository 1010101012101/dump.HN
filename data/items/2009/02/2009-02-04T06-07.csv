To do this we'd keep inventory at maybe 50 items per product cycle.<p>To keep customer's attention we'd ""introduce,"" or post, new and established products frequently. Perhaps multiple times a day.<p>I've think brick-and-mortar companies are unable to sell a lot of their product, especially upscale fashion retailers, because the price is too high. (Many are still considered successful, though.) And I'm confident retailers and suppliers will sell these ""neglected"" products at a certain price. And I'm determined to negotiate hard (but with integrity) on this.<p>I think this market has not been fully captured. There are some companies that focus on a niche (whiskey militia comes to mind), which has worked well for them. But I think there are many markets that are still untouched. But it'd be important to think and focus locally to build a great brand and company.<p>And given the current economy, people are focused on savings. I think right now, perhaps more than ever, people want to save anywhere they can. And if you combine savings with great taste, style, and reputable brands, I think you provide customers with a lot of value. I think this is what people want.<p>I think I have multiple skills to offer, though none are ""technical"" in nature, which is why a technical co-founder is instrumental. It'd be important to strike a relationship with vendors to be able to purchase these products. This is where my personality and skills come in. I'm a product/people guy, by passion. I enjoy going out and talking to others. I'm an obsessive doer who pays particular attention to the intracacies of peoples' individual personalities, as well as their common characteristics.<p>At the same time, I have considerable respect for technical people. For hackers. I think a great product guy and a great hacker would be a natural match for something like this. They'd both be dependent upon each other. They'd both drive and motivate each other to do what they love and are best at.",1233729800

Within the history of html, tables were intended for <i>tabular data</i>. The ideal of divs is to have an element that is specific to layout rather a tag for tabular data that one just happens to use for tabular.<p>Html, in general, is a messy. Html is one of the most amazing programming success stories, in the sense that it is the widely programming language by non-programmers. SIMPLE html created the web. Html that is that was so simple that the friggin w3c standards would never accept it now.<p>And the ""progress of standards"" has essentially only made this mircle lousier.

Creating the waste of space actually raised my karma on the whole, since after justifying myself enough the karma trend on those two posts reversed, and I got upvotes for some of the later posts.<p>On the other hand, if I'd left the initial two posts as they were, chances are they'd be at -30, -50, maybe -80 by now, and perhaps there'd be some huge righteously offended response like there has been in other cases where someone made a slightly caustic comment on a thread like this (I think we can both recall one case where this happened).<p>Lynch mob behaviour is real on this site.

Steve Jobs might have been a young entrepreneur, but he didn't create the iPhone at 29.  Rupert Murdoch might be ancient, but he's still a player (in all respects, apparently!).  Older people are a lot more interesting and competent than for which our industry, and our youth-obsessed culture, give them credit.<p>I would also like to note that people who get too much too quickly tend to burn out, lack social context, and suffer from other ailments which lead to general weirdness.  Pop stars aren't the only ones who face these issues.  Work is important, but you can't buy back your youth --  so <i>enjoy it</i>.  It is the single most valuable asset you have.<p>2.

465338,comment,464702,464702,0,0,NyxWulf,,,"It seems pretty cliche to quote a book in response to an article, but this article was pretty light on details and heavy on opinion.<p>A book I highly recommend to entrepreneurs is the 22 immutable laws of branding.  He cites a lot of statistics, and explains a lot of phenomenon that I have observed over the years.  Perhaps it just fits my biases but it is the best explanation of branding I've ever read.<p>Anyway, specifically in that book he principally discusses highly specific branded products versus this ""master brand"" idea.  The problem with master branding strategies is that people make up their mind about a product based on the brand, and they don't change that if it's for a new product.  A for instance is the tradition Chevy / Ford / Dodge debate.  Most people seem to be drawn to one of these brand, and they generally don't switch between them.  So even if Chevrolet introduces a brand new car that would solve someone's needs, if they are loyal to Ford, they won't cross that line.  Oddly, with a sub-brand like Corvette, it's positioned outside of that battle so people don't feel like they are crossing the picket line.<p>Other examples include Pepsi / Coke, Mac / Windows / Linux, etc.  Food companies have known this for a long time and don't prominently feature their company brand name on their food products.  Instead they focus on the brand of the product.<p>So what is the theory that underpins this belief?  Most people associate a brand name with one thing.  Quick off the top of your head, where do you buy your home electronics?  How about computers?  Where do you buy your Garden Supplies?  What about your books?  Did you know that Amazon sells all of those things?  Most people associate Amazon with books, and while they do sell those other things, the bulk of their revenue still comes from books.<p>The article claims a sub brand approach is more expensive, yet everything I've ever seen shows differently.  It's much more expensive to try to build a brand than to market the specific benefits of a given product.  Particularly for a startup, the best way to enter into a market is with a highly focused niche in an industry.  Focusing on a master brand makes that extremely difficult to do.<p>Sorry, kind of a long rant, but I really think that article is misguided.",1233728499

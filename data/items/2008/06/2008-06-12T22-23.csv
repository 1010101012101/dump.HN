But now I'd rather hack on FriendFeed simply because it serves a supserset of the same purpose and is likely just as hard (in other ways) under the hood.

216365,comment,216233,216317,0,0,thomasswift,,,"My short and fast rule Is charge about 4-6x your hourly salary of doing equivalent work. You pay more taxes, you are not receiving benefits, and most of all you are doing difficult work. Of course there are exceptions to this rule.<p>If you make $20/hr slinging code. Consulting that be $80/hr. May seem high, but really it is quite low. The big boys charge $250/hr. I think that rate is fair for small businesses.<p>If you need justification for charging a certain fee. Research numbers on how much it costs to actually hire someone full-time and all the extra costs associated with it. Time, Interviews, Job board placements, training, benefits(big costs long haul). If your being hired to do something you know and pretty much getting going on day one, they should be paying a decent sum of money for you, because you had already done the legwork, you step in and work.<p>You are also temporary to them if the contract ends(a.k.a they fire you), as employee you get unemployment(extra cost to the company), exit interviews, more time and money wasted. If you an IC the contract ends, what are you going to do. Look for the next gig, more time spent with no money coming in.<p>My favorite pricing quote is the one about the artist, name escapes me. A lady asks him to paint her caricature of face and he get out a piece of paper, paints a few lines and she says it's amazing and ask how much, he says 5k or something. She says thats ridiculous it took you five minutes. He responds no it took me my whole life.<p>I'm not saying I'm picasso or monet or whatever, but the work you do today will be added to your overall experience and knowledge that you will apply to the jobs of tomorrow, and you should be compensated for that. i also don't change $1000/min (it be nice) - sorry for rambling",1213310193

216363,comment,215527,215758,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"This was about 4 years ago.  SharePoint may have improved since then, but the main thing that I didn't like about it compared to Trac was it forced you into a single structure which was hard to change, especially if you weren't the person who originally set it up.<p>When I joined, a SharePoint structure was already established and filled with out of date design documents.  Unfortunately nobody (other than me) wanted to it bring up to date because they were already behind schedule getting things actually working.  This in itself is not suprising - unless it's specifically part of their job, whoever sets up this kind of collaboration software generally won't to spend the ongoing effort to keep it organized properly and up to date so rigid structures that look good at the start often end up looking like dilapidated housing projects from the 1970's.<p>Part of the reason SharePoint sucked was that it offered no intrinsic editing, rendering or linking features.  All it could really do is offer a place to put other documents.  With Trac or any other wiki, editing and linking pages is trivial so its less of an ongoing effort to keep up to date.  Furthermore anyone with the time is free generally free to create a separate collections of pages with whatever organization they want.  This means newcomers can easily create new structures that reflects the current engineering design while referring back to the old information.",1213310054

216347,comment,216134,216254,0,0,mynameishere,,,"It's mainly a re-adjustment based upon the diminished chances of a microsoft buyout. I own MSFT stock (bought some speculatively, expected the deal to fall through, as it did), and at this point Yahoo seems, in fact, quite dead. (I don't mean its properties, but its corporate independence.) I suspect that when it becomes <i>clear</i> that a google deal will happen, yahoo will drop another 30-40 percent. It's really that bad.<p>What's keeping it up is the continued possibility of a stockholder revolt, which is precisely what needs to happen. (Supposedly, someone was organizing it, but I haven't followed along.) The stockholders need to oust the whole board, and replace it will a cleanup crew, who'll sell out to microsoft.<p>A google/yahoo buyout won't happen. The gov't (hopefully) wouldn't allow it.",1213308855

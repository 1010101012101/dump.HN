For instance, if the Linux kernel is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation, and the DHCP client is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution, on a traditional system, anyone on the other side of your Ethernet cable can root your machine. Under Qubes, all they can do is root the Xen domain that&#x27;s providing networking -- but that&#x27;s not significantly more power than they had than by being on the other end of your network cable, since that domain does nothing other than networking.<p><a href=""https://qubes-os.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://qubes-os.org/</a><p>I&#x27;m not convinced that Linux is unkillable, though.

It&#x27;s how humans operate.<p>Transparency in pay is a way in which good people can be confronted by their bias. In any one situation, you can argue that a woman deserves less (rationally and justly -- just change the rules for evaluation so she loses [1]). If via transparency and use of data you notice that women are consistently paid less, and that your evaluation criteria keep changing, you can realize your implicit bias and change your actions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://advance.cornell.edu/documents/ImpactofGender.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://advance.cornell.edu/documents/ImpactofGender.pdf</a> , <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9120783"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9120783</a> .",1422125643

8940509,comment,8939957,8939957,0,0,paxunix,,,"You must pay attention to the details if you will ever become a good programmer (not necessarily the same as being detail-oriented).  This may mean different things depending on context: designing a system?  The implementation details aren&#x27;t very relevant yet.  Building the system?  Those details become very important.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming for over 20 years and I&#x27;ve come to think the two most important factors contributing to a &quot;good&quot; programmer are communication skill and attention to detail (both of which can be learned, though some seem innately good at both at the outset).<p>For example:  let&#x27;s say you are reviewing someone&#x27;s code.  You notice they&#x27;ve missed some null checks, haven&#x27;t properly handled exceptions or ignore some failure cases, aren&#x27;t doing object comparisons properly, etc.  They insist the code works fine (if you&#x27;re putting up untested code for review, you should be beaten), but those little things now consume the reviewer&#x27;s valuable time and head-space when they should have been sorted out before the review was ever posted.  As the reviewer, you get caught up in an endless stream of niggling little details and nitpicking, rather than focussing on the logic and design and structure of the code.  Meanwhile, the programmer feels very productive (&quot;hey, I&#x27;ve just churned out a whole new module&quot;) and moved on to the next task, essentially relying on everyone else to finish his job.<p>Missing some things like this now and then doesn&#x27;t make one a bad programmer, but consistently neglecting/forgetting them implies a lack of attention to detail and makes me wonder what else they&#x27;re missing that I&#x27;m just not seeing (slog through several hundred lines in a code review and you will inevitably start missing things (<a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/11-proven-practices-for-peer-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/11-proven...</a> )).  It also creates a lot of busy-work churn for the whole team that has to deal with that code.  They may seem to be very productive, but they&#x27;re actually dragging down the overall productivity of the team because everyone else has to point out the little things that were missed, as well as most likely re-review the code once all the small-detail changes have been made.<p>EDIT: fixed link",1422125461

8940469,comment,8934786,8939815,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I would say that the SF failure-is-good culture has good and bad influences from the VCs. They don&#x27;t care <i>that</i> you failed. They care <i>why</i> you failed. If their evaluation is that you failed in good faith, you get to call it a learning experience and you get an executive position at Google (preferably something with the authority to buy companies, so you can pay them back) or more funding for your next venture. If they judge you to have failed in bad faith, then you&#x27;re black-balled. So it cuts both ways. It&#x27;s nice that they&#x27;ll go to bat for someone they judge to have failed in good faith; it&#x27;s bad when someone gets blacklisted as having failed in bad faith (or has his successful business taken from him) because he pissed someone off.<p>Any time you replace objective evaluation of people with subjective holistic evaluations, you get a system that seems more humane and less sharp-cornered, but you also get corruption. It&#x27;s the question of which is better: sheer cold fairness or sticky warm humanness that can devolve into corruption or even a reputation economy (meaning, &quot;extortion system&quot;) if the powerful abuse their roles in the judgment of others.<p>You can look at it charitably and say that the VCs are doing good by caring more about the reason for failure than the fact of it. Or you can look at it negatively and say that it creates a culture where (a) slimy operators good at creating impressions can play politics and let their companies rot, knowing that their backers will see their failures as &quot;good faith&quot; regardless of the facts, and (b) those with power over the &quot;holistic&quot; element of evaluation evolve into reputation-making and -breaking extortionists. The &quot;right answer&quot; is somewhere between the two.<p>With Chicago, I think the problem isn&#x27;t that there&#x27;s a lack of good jobs for technical people, but that the job-hopper stigma is still very strong in finance (and that&#x27;s true everywhere; it&#x27;s not geographical, and the attitude is similar in SF finance). So it&#x27;s hard for a trader to bounce back if the startup doesn&#x27;t work.<p>If hedge funds were willing to hire people with typical startup/tech CVs-- those tend to show the brutally honest behavior of job-hopping (even at 2 years, or 6 months) if one&#x27;s career is stagnating, rather than sticking around for 5-6 playing the system or slacking like white-collar people are &quot;supposed&quot; to do when passed over, because it&#x27;s somehow more disloyal to leave than to slack for years-- then people would less afraid to do startups. The fault isn&#x27;t with Chicago <i>per se</i>. It&#x27;s with finance and the F500 world and their anachronistic hatred of the &quot;job hopper&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a lot that I don&#x27;t like about California startup culture but I think job hopping is a good thing. If you&#x27;re ambitious and it&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;ve been passed over for advancement, it&#x27;s better for everyone to move on than to stick around and suck out a salary and play against the system for 5+ years because the white-collar world thinks you&#x27;re &quot;supposed&quot; to show &quot;staying power&quot; or &quot;loyalty&quot;.<p>At any rate, I think you&#x27;re completely right. I don&#x27;t think that California is more or less risk averse than the rest of the country, nor do I necessarily think that risk seeking is even a virtue. California entrepreneurs get to look more risk-friendly just because there&#x27;s such a high frequency managed outcomes (acqui-hires and executive positions made available if the VCs judge you to have failed in good faith) that VC-funded entrepreneurs can count on one. Where it&#x27;s pernicious is when these founders justify massive equity disparities (compared to the 0.5% that the first engineer gets) because they &quot;took all the risk&quot; when, in fact, most of these VC-funded founders don&#x27;t take <i>any</i> more risk than any other corporate employee.",1422124634

8940466,comment,8939957,8939957,0,0,abathur,,,"I think it&#x27;s useful to point out that, much like with any other written language, there are two collaborative processes at play here--reading for understanding, and proofreading/editing. As someone who has a lot of &#x27;detail&#x27; trouble (I miss a lot of detail in day-to-day life), but who is also a writer, editor and programmer--there&#x27;s most-certainly a lot of room for improvement. I&#x27;ll talk about writing for a bit before I bring this back to programming.<p>Many writers have a miserable time proofreading their own work--and it&#x27;s this way because they already have a strong mental model of what they wrote. When our brain already has a strong model, it can hide a lot of detail from us. It&#x27;s really just trying to help free our attention for _new_ detail, but in cases like this it causes problems. I suspect you&#x27;re having trouble finding these minor issues in your own code, and I also suspect you&#x27;d find them more readily in code you aren&#x27;t familiar with (if you&#x27;re proficient at reading code you didn&#x27;t write--itself a muscle that must be developed.)<p>My perception is that the biggest component of developing the ability to proofread my own writing was learning to edit other people&#x27;s writing in a very exacting manner. Other people write differently than you do; when you edit them in an exacting manner, you&#x27;re strengthening processes for applying arbitrary rules, deciding which arbitrary rules are worth enforcing, and building your own sense of style. When you just do this to yourself, it can take longer for you to develop strong opinions, because you aren&#x27;t forced to encounter all of the mistakes and tics other writers make. Getting pissed off at all of the annoying shit other writers do will provide both the eye and motivation to attack your own writing with a scalpel. Learning to admire perfect pacing, metaphors, structure and word-choice will slowly prepare you to realize when you fall short. From there, it can help to apply what you&#x27;ve learned to older writing that you&#x27;re less familiar with; the gap you need to read yourself clearly will shrink.<p>In programming, I think the most succinct analog to this process is refactoring other people&#x27;s code (note: I didn&#x27;t say rewrite. Avoid that temptation.) Likewise, it&#x27;s also really useful to refactor your own code once it has become unfamiliar; you&#x27;ll both realize how you&#x27;ve grown, and identify some of your own annoying tendencies. When you invest time in activities like this, you&#x27;re building strong models of where things should be, and how they should be done. You&#x27;ll cope with common problems, and develop a sense of how code can be written to make those mistakes harder to make in the first place, and easier to spot when you do.<p>I realize I haven&#x27;t said a word about finding stray semicolons or an errant bracket, yet, but my point is: there are classes of mistake that are much easier to find when you&#x27;re reading like an editor than when you&#x27;re reading like a programmer.",1422124584

A more realistic version of the movie &quot;Limitless&quot;.<p>They don&#x27;t seem to help with creativity, and can do the opposite. It&#x27;s easy to get concentrated on the wrong thing. I knew a PHP dev on pro vigil long term, and when he&#x27;d take an extra dose of stims, you could tell. A flurry of good idea emails in the morning, then disappeared into his office all day.<p>But... One time, he spent all day trying to optimize the platform for <i>TLB misses</i>.

Why should we not want most of the population to have performance enhancing medication? As you note, the state is well aware of the effectiveness.<p>Also note that stimulants can cause psychosis over time, so there is some risk in having everyone use them all the time.

There are two issues with that:<p>(a) This isn&#x27;t a one-time pad at all, because the keystream comes from /dev/random. This is, instead, a simple stream cipher keyed from the /dev/random CSPRNG. Since /dev/random is difficult in practice to seed and run deterministically, the only mode you can run it in is &quot;one time pad mode&quot;. How close to an actual OTP it is depends on your environment.<p>(b) One-time pads don&#x27;t work well in practice. Enthusiasts fixate on the &quot;unbreakable&quot; point without having a full mental model of how a cryptosystem works. That robs them of the insight that (i) only a small part of the cryptosystem is &quot;theoretically unbreakable&quot; with an OTP, and (ii) that part is, in the history of cryptanalysis, <i>the least risky component of the system</i>. In exchange for hardening what was already the strongest component of any cryptosystem, OTP crypto makes grave sacrifices in other parts of the system that are routinely and profitably exploited. It&#x27;s a terrible tradeoff.<p>Seconding the (pragmatic) skeptical comments in this thread. Don&#x27;t use anything like this to encrypt real data. You are safer with any modern block or stream cipher than you are with a ad-hoc stream cipher, which is what this is in practice.<p>As a learning experience, though: keep at it! This isn&#x27;t a bad start at all.<p>If you like/grok how this cipher works, a great next step towards practical cryptography is to learn Salsa20, which is a very simple algorithmic keystream generator that is fast and highly regarded by cryptographers.<p>But I think practical crypto engineering is a bad next step. The better next step is to take this knowledge and apply it to practical <i>cryptanalysis</i>. Trust me: if you&#x27;re just getting started with crypto and you&#x27;re a programmer, you will get 1000x more insight from learning to break systems than you will from building random systems.

8940397,comment,8934786,8939938,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Silicon Valley is somewhat of an aberration at this point. There&#x27;s an S-curve to concentration (whether in talent, resources, or attention) and while the bulk of American cities are hurting due to a lack of software talent, Silicon Valley is hurting in its own way. It has a lot of engineering talent but a collective lack of political talent (which is what prevents engineers from organizing and getting real equity instead of fucking 1% for the first engineer) and such abysmal HR/management that an exclusionary macho brogrammer culture (that wouldn&#x27;t fly outside of VC-funded startups) has been allowed to emerge.<p>So, trying to replicate Silicon Valley isn&#x27;t a good strategy. It&#x27;s not very desirable. It&#x27;s also not possible. Not for New York, not for Chicago, not for Seattle, not for Austin. Should these cities be grabbing a greater share of the new-technology action? Yeah, absolutely. But trying to replicate the culture of a sexist, racist suburban shithole whose high priests think it&#x27;s OK to block off public beach access (cf. Vinod Khosla) is undesirable. It&#x27;s happening slowly, but that shit is <i>dying</i> (although it will take two to four decades). Why does the contemporary Valley put such a high premium on pedigree? Because when a society goes into decline, nostalgia dominates. When the Valley was coming up, it didn&#x27;t matter if you went to Stanford or UC-Irvine or a community college in Nebraska, so long as you were smart and could code. In its decline phase, you see the Stanford Welfare of Clinkle and Snapchat getting funded.<p>Talent has a natural desire to concentrate, and that might limit us to ~10 strong tech cities in the US, but Silicon Valley has blown past that natural inclination toward concentration. It&#x27;s deep into the &quot;congested&quot; territory.<p>What makes Silicon Valley is that it&#x27;s a condensation point for passive capital. Passive capitalists (teachers&#x27; pension funds that invest in VC firms) want returns, and don&#x27;t seem to strongly care about where or how the capital is deployed. The priesthood that is trusted (in error) to do so are VCs who mostly live in California, and who almost never fund companies more than 30 miles from where they live, so the job and wealth creation is limited to a small geographic area (in which it&#x27;s almost impossible for an engineer, if he&#x27;s starting now or recently, to make wealth due to astronomical real estate costs) far away from where the passive capitalists live. Now, if the passive capitalists had a vote, they probably wouldn&#x27;t want <i>all</i> of their money being directed at a small geographical area where most of them could never afford to live. All being equal-- and by &quot;all&quot;, I mostly mean &quot;return on investment&quot;-- Nebraska police officers would rather their pensions be invested in Nebraska businesses and create jobs there... rather than have that money be funneled off to California. Of course, they&#x27;d be completely happy to have their money invested in California if that would bring better returns... but VC has been a low-performing asset class for a decade-- the VCs focus on their own careers rather than building great companies or generating returns on the portfolio-- so the passive capitalists are arguably getting screwed. If concentrating the passive capital in Silicon Valley was generating decent returns, then there&#x27;d be no reasonable argue against it, but it&#x27;s not.<p>This is a long-form way of saying that I agree with you. Replicating Silicon Valley is a backward-looking strategy that won&#x27;t work in Chicago or New York. These cities, instead, should focus on their own assets. I think Chicago (or Seattle, or Boulder, or for a longer shot, Minneapolis) is a contender for being a different kind of technical leader in, say, 2030... because Chicago has an unusual advantage of a perceived playing-from-behind while actually not being that far behind; that&#x27;s fairly antithetical to the Valley&#x27;s Dunning-Kruger smug cloud... but it won&#x27;t look like the existing Valley.

The patrimonial rights can be transferred in Europe too that's clearly what you do when you make the transfer of copyright in US. As the common ground of the Berne Convention has been ratified by US and Europe, the transfer of copyright (on the patrimonial aspect[1]) is based on a common legal ground.<p>[1] Concerning the ""moral rights"" in software/computer program, it's usually not legally applicable for software.",1356209904

I'm clearly irritated by the post; that's not a mystery.  But to argue that I'm being <i>patronizing</i>, you have to ignore what I'm actually saying: we all have innate social skills, and that the author starts from the opposite premise.  He's trying to figure out why this ""developer CEO"" is so <i>different</i>, when the difference appears to be trivial (one person is asking analytical questions).<p>The original post was clearly phrased in an adversarial manner:<p><i>""Sales Guy""</i> vs <i>""Developer Guy""</i><p><i>""I, on the other hand...""</i><p><i>""Whereas he based the value of the meeting...""</i><p><i>""Where he took my generalized questions and drove them to specific topics - that was the interesting part. That let me know whats on his mind.""</i><p>Plus, there was the hint of a ""gotcha"" tone:<p><i>""That will give me the context for assessing future activities by his company.""</i><p>Basically, he's starting from the premise that this other person is somehow <i>not</i> making these social judgments; that they're <i>not</i> building a mental model of how their conversational partner operates.  That's wrong, and it's (IMO) arrogant:  his thinking rests upon the implicit assumption of The Other as a stranger.

American's likely killed significantly more civilians in European bombing campaigns than we did in Hiroshima, but anyone with a shred of moral judgment can differentiate between civilians killed due to proximity to military targets (European bombing) vs. what we would call today state terrorism -- the intent to kill large numbers of civilians at Hiroshima to demonstrate our power.<p>So what percent of those killed in the drone strikes are civilians? To what extent does the military weigh the risk of killing civilians when evaluating potential missions? Is any of this unique to drone strikes?<p>I can't come to any conclusion but that this was just a generic collection of musings to generate outrage. It has nothing to do with Connecticut.

The Facebook API maybe free - but the price you pay is to give facebook  a cheap way to find out what other use cases their data, infrastructure and ecosystem can have.

Just look back a few days ago at the instagram flip-flop.<p>This is also a part of being a member of the free-market - companies copy each other all the time - when an FMCG launches a new type of __ (insert consumer good of choice here) - its only a matter of time before all the other players launch a variant.

4957412,comment,4956625,4957267,2,0,Dove,,,"I think it's present, but not a dominant factor.  Depends on culture and training.<p>What Milgram measured was how inexperienced people react to a new ethical situation.  If he had tested people who were familiar with the context--fellow scientists--I very much suspect the results would be different.  That's true in many fields.  You might be able to intimidate a junior engineer into including a substandard part in a safety-critical area, but a senior engineer will refuse.  And then he'll quit.  It's not that he has more character; he has more experience.<p>Soldiers have a lot of experience.  If you order them to hurt people immorally, their reactions are more like the senior engineer than the junior one: measures of character, not measures of how quickly they can think about a new situation.<p>There have always been soldiers who said, at the eventual trial, that they were ""just following orders"".  I think they're generally inexperienced, but I'm sure there are cowards who think that way at the end of a career, too.  I'm sure the prevalence depends on culture and training, but that does show that the effect Milgram measured is present.<p>I do have some evidence that it isn't dominant, though.  Historically speaking, conquering armies have behaved in conquered countries pretty much as they pleased--sometimes very badly.  But to get a soldier to kill his own countrymen, it has generally been necessary to threaten him or his family with death -- mere orders have not been enough.  The soldier has a limit on what he'll do for authority, and he'll quit sooner than Milgram's subjects did.<p>It takes courage to make a high stakes moral decision correctly; I won't claim that everyone has it.  I don't know what the rate is, and I expect it varies widely by culture and training.  But I do think that in order to measure it, you need to test professionals.  Extrapolating from amateurs isn't good enough.  Perhaps a repeat Milgram would be a start: test all the same subjects again a week later, after they've had plenty of time to think about the experience.",1356208741

4957380,comment,4956998,4956998,6,0,btilly,,,"Copyright assignment has a major purpose that is not acknowledged in this article.  In some jurisdictions (I know that this used to be the case in the state of New York) it is the case that, by default, all software produced by employees who are software developers belongs to the employer, whether or not that software was developed on personal equipment, away from the office.  In those jurisdictions it is also the case that many programmers who labor under this oppressive legal regime are entirely unaware that their time is not truly their own.  They may therefore contribute to open source projects, and claim licensing on software, that is not truly valid.<p>The FSF copyright assignment process stands as a guarantee that GNU software, at least, will never encounter any issues based on these legal facts.  You may use GNU software with assurance that the legal status of that software is very, very clear.<p>What about the rest of us?  Well there is a defense for copyright infringement that basically says, ""I relied on reasonable assurances that I was not, in fact, infringing.""  That covers your past infringement.  But not necessarily future offenses.  But the risk is still low.  As a practical matter, companies rarely sue over this type of issue, and if they do, they generally have little interest in suing every innocent bystander who accidentally infringed.  So many may find the risk acceptable.<p>But Stallman is an absolutist.  He wants absolute guarantees.  And copyright assignment helps him get there.<p>Please note that I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.",1356207902

From reading it, one could get the idea that all the problem stems from GNU coding standard being archaic and not updated for modern programming.<p>Okey, I am skipping all the rant about FSF not funding software projects to pay developers, or that the GNU brand is not ""hot"", but both feels a bit silly. The hotness of a brand is transient, and in reality, only a handful number of brands inspires users and developers. I can't see how GNU would be more or less hot than say Gnome, KDE, or apache which each has a large number of projects under them. As for funding, since when did any of those organizations actually fund the projects? They role is provide help in setting up funding systems, help with tax declarations and provide further legal help.<p>Thankfully, the last link in the end (<a href=""http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/529522/854aed3fb6398b79/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/529522/854aed3fb6398b79/</a>) looks to bring some light of what the actually issues really are: copyright assignments being US only, who the ""owner"" of a community project is, Nikos' feeling that he aren't getting any tangible benefits from being under the name GNU, and last a request for more transparency in the GNU projects decision process.<p>As for those reasons, there are two I agree with and two I don't. Firstly, Copyright assignments being US only is bad and shows an inflexibility a non-profit foundation should not have. Their role is to help projects, and thus should be as flexible as possible and thus provide equal possibility to assign copyright to US or EU. Second, as for who the owner of a community project is, the answer should stare the developers in the face. It should always be the community (developers and users) that ""own"" the project and decides its fate. If Nikos' announcement had included a decision by the community (preferable in a transparent manner), it would had been hard for GNU to object. Third, Nikos' feeling that he aren't getting any tangible benefits from GNU are his to have, but legal assistance is something many projects value. If a project has no need for legal assistance, no need for help in creating donation systems, and don't feel a threat about lawsuits against individual developers, then a foundation such as GNU, Apache or other similar organization are not going to give much tangible benefits. Fourth, in regard to more transparency in the GNU projects decision process, I can only agree with Nikos. The corner pillar in a community is transparency, and GNU should be fully aware of this. If there are discontent growing because of an lack of transparency, it should be addressed and fixed with high priority.",1356207168

There used to be some great discussions of it on Usenet but it seems like maybe Google has lost them. Here are the cliff's notes as I remember them:<p>* The root cause of the disaster was a management decision to re-use the Ariane 4 navigation system without any testing for the new rocket, on the grounds that testing is expensive and time-consuming.<p>* The Ariane 4 was a slower rocket than the Ariane 5 so numbers with respect to speed and acceleration were smaller.<p>* During launch, there was an integer overflow in a system that was only needed prior to launch and continued running through the launch for no reason. I <i>believe</i> it was code to do INS synchronization. The integer overflow couldn't happen on an Ariane 4 due to slower velocities.<p>* While that system wasn't necessary for launch, the overflow caused an Ada exception to be raised, which was uncaught and caused the whole navigation system to terminate.<p>* Once the range safety system (also written in Ada) recognized that the rocket was out of control it automatically terminated the launch to protect those on the ground.<p>MISRA C people immediately leaped on the disaster claiming that ""Ada caused it,"" on the grounds that C code would have silently ignored the error. Ada's exceptions are similar to those in most modern languages and the ""exception wars"" have now pretty much been won by the pro-exception people, so the whole argument is pretty archaic.<p>Of course MISRA C and C++ are slowly beating Ada in the market even though they're an inferior fit for purpose because of the perception that the ecosystem is healthier.<p>I've also heard that the integer overflow was actually caught by the hardware itself, which generated a signal that the Ada runtime turned into a native exception. So had it been C code it wouldn't have silently ignored the problem, it would have terminated due to an uncaught signal.",1356206507

Why?<p>My point about drug dealers is that I can see having no respect for the person that deals drugs as they themselves produce harm (they could sell to kids).",1356206451

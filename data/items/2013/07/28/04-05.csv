6115675,comment,6113487,6113487,1,0,lbenes,,,"I had some experience with GnuPG and Symantec PGP and Outlook a few years back. All non-public information like CAD files were supposed to be PGP encrypted. Yet, even the engineers would send most files in plain text. I remember many times having to logmein to a clients machine to try to figure out why they couldn&#x27;t read our emails. This is why PGP never took off.<p>Until the tools take 5 min to setup, and encryption/decryption is automatically handled by the mail client, PGP will never take off. Things like the public key directory have to handled transparently to the user.<p>It&#x27;s too bad Mozilla dropped support for Thunderbird. Tight integration with GnuPG plugin could have made mainstream PGP a reality. For OS X at least, it looks like GPGMail is nearly there.",1374987259

Left and right columns are not part of the tetris field and have the same depth with the page itself (Z=0). Middle column is the tetris field with 5 playable columns which is the deepest layer on the page (Z=-2). And the tetris pieces are on an intermediate layer between those two layers (Z=-1).

My claim is that the network effects which have previously helped Apple (iTunes, iCloud, iMessage, exclusive apps etc) depend on a non-niche market share and inter-product synergy. They&#x27;re approaching a dangerous tipping point here, IMO. How many iPhone users no longer sync to iTunes, for example?<p><i>It is not obvious that Apple could win, or even survive, by going after the low end, or by being more general. Apple is great as a premium brand, but as a shoddy value brand like Samsung?</i><p>They&#x27;ve done nothing but lose ground since Jobs died. The time to try alternative strategies is now. Plus, there&#x27;s a lot of livable room between a premium brand and junk brand. Apple can continue to charge a premium over Android, IMO, but not the extreme premium they&#x27;ve enjoyed since 2007.<p><i>How many iOS users even bother with iMessage? Just install WeChat and forget about it.</i><p>Apple should care about this because it&#x27;s one fewer thing keeping people from easily switching to another brand. More and more the apps people care about are available on other platforms and that shifts the debate to cost and/or other features like screen size, stylus support etc.",1374987137

You&#x27;re addressing the issue of authentication, but there are more systemic problems to the internet than just authentication.<p>Such as, preventing network timing attacks to figure out which internet subscriber is communicating with another subscriber, by routing more directly between two peers, thus bypassing surveillance points as much as possible.<p>It should also be possible to defend against nationstate enforced network splits by introducing adhoc connections, as easily as deploying a pair of devices across borders.<p>There might ideally be a method of compensating routers in real time with some distributed currency, to incentivize the growth of this network.<p>It&#x27;s really difficult to bypass surveillance efforts by global telecoms, when most people get their internet channeled through central systems.",1374987008

His skin color has certainly contributed a great deal to his experience and experience informs our politics for all of us. Listen to his comments on the Zimmeman verdict. When people (of all races) felt he was &quot;their guy&quot; it is in part because of a certain &quot;underdog&quot; association we assign to minorities in a majority culture. And it is reasonable to expect a certain sensitivity from a person whose culture has experienced its share of struggle.<p>His work as a community organizer was more an indication of his character and concern for those who were struggling. It wasn&#x27;t about his performance. It was about his heart. And, remember, in 2008 many people were struggling. They felt he related to them.<p>You stated that his background/experiene is unremarkable, then  went on to list many of the reasons it actually is remarkable. I mean, you literally remarked on it. So, apparently we agree.<p>><i>And all his objections to Bush&#x27;s expansion of the government on the wake of 9/11 turned to be purely partisan gamesmanship</i><p>That&#x27;s hindsight.

We can&#x27;t be so sure about lions.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about higher-order intelligence, I&#x27;m talking about sentience -- the ability to experience.<p>It is rather simple now to find a program that would defeat the original formulation for a Turing test, but no one would describe them as having consciousness.<p>However, I believe it very possible that humans are doing much the same thing with a sort of sentience Turing test that we project onto animals.  They _seem_ to have experience, because they react to stimuli. But the same is true of the computer.<p>We know that creatures with basically nothing in the way of a brain, take earthworms or severed octopus tentacles, will react to pain, hide from it.<p>We also know that pain has two parts -- a conscious experience, and an animal aversion. This is made clear by the existence of Pain asymbolia, where a person gets damage to the insular cortex (a lower part of the brain), and is no longer averse to pain, despite reporting that they still experience the pain just as they did before the injury.<p>I believe it quite likely that consciousness exists in the human brain alone, and is of very recent evolutionary vintage, evolving in conjunction with language. That when humans project sentience on their pets they are basically falling in love with a biological automaton, no different from a person falling in love with a chat-bot.<p>Unless we find a reason to believe that mere programming couldn&#x27;t account for the behavior of animals (which seems increasingly unlikely, as our own rather rudimentary robots advance), it seems much more likely that evolution would have evolved the simple instinct system first -- only adding consciousness later on when it became an evolutionary necessity, as could have been the case for complex communication about qualia.",1450939728
10787377,comment,10786512,10787193,0,0,derefr,,,"You&#x27;re right; to be clear, what I was talking about above was whether the passes are decoupled at an abstract level, not so much whether the implementation uses multiple phases.<p>You can take LLVM &quot;bitcode&quot; as the <i>product</i> of clang, move it to another system with a different arch, and finish compiling the IR to a native binary on that system. This implies that the first step and second step don&#x27;t share any state other than the IR itself—meaning that flags passed directly to clang in the first phase can&#x27;t <i>affect</i> codegen, other than by influencing the generated IR; and that codegen has to treat the IR (and the environment) as its sole inputs.<p>Whereas with GCC, as far as I know, the RTL IR isn&#x27;t arch-neutral, and the GENERIC/GIMPLE IRs aren&#x27;t fully &quot;baked&quot; yet (i.e. they&#x27;re compiler->compiler step IRs, not post-compilation pre-codegen IRs.) So there&#x27;s no conceptual guarantee (even if there&#x27;s an implementation-level one) that the compiler won&#x27;t use compile-phase state to inform codegen.<p>In other words: it&#x27;s guaranteed that you&#x27;d be able to implement the switches I&#x27;m talking about in clang+LLVM. You <i>might</i> (but won&#x27;t necessarily) have to do some work to get GCC into the right shape to implement them.",1450939720

Because rewriting all that code is an economic impossibility.  There&#x27;s a very long way to go before the rate of foundational Rust code written exceeds the rate of foundational C/C++ code written.  And even if you manage to have 100% Rust and 0% C/C++ code being written, you still have a huge legacy to write, which literally costs billions of dollars (ALL operating systems, ALL browsers, ALL interpreters (Python/PHP/Perl/...), ALL compilers (GCC, LLVM), ALL web servers, etc.)<p>Honestly I think your view of technological adoption is fairly naive -- I don&#x27;t see much content here other than &quot;everyone get behind Rust!&quot;.<p>IMO the more realistic approach is a systems approach: make it so that badly written C code doesn&#x27;t completely hose your system.  I like the application compartmentalization work (Chrome style, DJB style), and capability work like Capsicum.  And LangSec work in making safe parsers.  The trusted computing base has to be reduced.  Not every line of C code should run in a trusted context!!!  Principle of least privilege.  We know (or should know) all this stuff.<p>That is many of orders of less magnitude less work / cost, and I think actually feasible.  Coherent and secure systems architecture is more achievable than everybody writing perfect C code or everybody switching to another language.<p>Another thing the Rust community should be working on is easy and efficient IPC with C programs.  So you can rewrite a secure core in Rust and communicate with legacy C/C++ running in an untrusted OS context.<p>And also fixing the mess that is Linux containers, so it isn&#x27;t so difficult to secure them (i.e. see Docker&#x27;s security issues)",1450939333

Furthermore if you have a good idea the odds are extremely high that someone else has had the same idea. &quot;Inventions&quot; are almost never worth the name. Things generally follow a natural progression (at least in technology):<p>1. Some wild-eyed visionaries (sometimes from academia) come up with crazy visions of what computing might be like in the future. This vision is usually highly impractical, requiring vastly more compute power or vastly cheaper components than exist. Further the software is the quality you&#x27;d expect from academic professors (garbage) and barely works for a few minor demos. This is the pre-prototype phase.<p>2. Someone brings a more realistic version to market. Sometimes the first to market fails badly because they arrive too soon. The product is too limited or the market isn&#x27;t ready yet.<p>3. Finally someone brings a version of the invention to market that is a sellable product.<p>What matters is execution.<p>Ericsson had a touch screen phone? So what. In high-school in the late 90s I had a PocketPC predating the Ericsson phone; it was fucking obvious back then that they&#x27;d add a cellular radio to it as soon as it became practical (I know, I carried a Windows Mobile phone for a while). They were all garbage. They took no risks. They didn&#x27;t have the animation or feedback systems that made iOS so pleasant to use. None of them even pretended to offer a real web browser - it was WAP if anything. Everything before the iPhone was qualitatively and quantitatively inferior, even if it happened to have a janky plastic touch screen. They sure as hell weren&#x27;t running slimmed down desktop operating systems with fully-featured frameworks. They ran whatever software your carrier deigned to offer at vastly inflated prices.<p>There&#x27;s a good reason the engineers at Blackberry thought the iPhone was a faked demo. There&#x27;s a good reason Apple waltz in and completely upended and transformed the cellular industry.<p>Of course this all ignores that Apple had the Newton because it doesn&#x27;t matter who had something first.

They just thought that smog levels would continue rising faster than greenhouse gas levels, so that the cooling affect that smog causes would be more significant than the warming effect greenhouse gases cause.<p>Their only mistake was not anticipating that we would actually start taking air pollution seriously enough to not only stop the smog rise but reverse it.

Like pulling teeth to hear a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, Happy Hanukkah from anyone. No one seems to know what to do, what won&#x27;t get them in trouble, or no one is celebrating any holiday at all. Do you have any ideas on why you think that is happening?<p>This is extreme, but I can&#x27;t think of a milder way to say it. <rant>Why hate on Christmas? Do they hate on Hanukkah? Do they hate good will toward each other? Peace on Earth? How can you hate something that is generally a good message? Why not just let folks have their happy celebrations? Isn&#x27;t that the idea behind tolerance for others? Must they hold someone else down to push themselves up?</rant> whew! Sorry about all that.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of The Offspring &quot;It&#x27;s cool to hate&quot; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkRJzErnRmY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkRJzErnRmY</a>",1450937136

There was a COBOL compiler for the IBM 1401 with about 79 passes.[1]  They only had 4K or so of memory, but they had fast tape drives, so each pass read the previous intermediate form, did some processing on it, and wrote out the next intermediate form. Except for the passes which did sorts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/140x/C24-3146-3_1401_cobolOper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/140x/C2...</a>",1450937135

A few months ago I asked everyone to watch the same shows in SD and 720P and pick if the 720P version was worth the extra bandwidth and the size of my library being drastically reduced. Three people picked the 720p option. But they were the three that watch very little.<p>Movies were different. I did the same thing but with 720p and 1080p versions of movies. The majority wanted 1080p even if it meant a smaller library.",1450936946

They tended to hide behind sciencese in regards the significance of their work and didn’t go too much into its importance - the English don’t like to boast in public about themselves :)<p>What is important is they have showed how you can achieve extinction - we have known for a while that it was possible in theory, but there has not been a practical way of achieving this. We now have a practical way doing this - basically there are no limit to the number of genes you can target with the CRISPR-Cas9 driver system. Target enough and the species goes extinct.<p>If this approach is implemented it will save millions of people - every day we delay means another 3000 people die.",1450936912

It just feels to risky to put that tine edge close to your knees; the screen would drop on the floor too easily. That means you will have to move the edge of the screen at least, say, 15 cm from your knees. Also, having that 'one, steep, angle' for the stand would mean that looking at the screen would be a problem.<p>So, I would guess using the stand is out. That leaves placing the screen flat on your upper legs with the keyboard in front of it. In that setup, I am still worried about the keyboard detaching from the screen, and the screen dropping on the floor. The keyboard would have to be attached fairly firmly to the screen for that setup to feel secure. It also would place the screen in an awkward location for reading: too far away, and at an inconvenient angle. So, for that setup, I expect you will want something that wraps both the underside of the keyboard and the back of the screen, and props up the screen by, say, 10 cm. I guess something like that will pop up on Kickstarter soon.",1351375062

4707357,comment,4704898,4705915,2,0,lagom,,,"If only Scala compilation weren't so slow. This is a bit off topic, but I find the difference between Scala and Go to exemplify some of the fundamental tradeoffs in the languages.<p>Scala is certainly the more researchy language with an advanced type system, better type inference, and multi-paradigm. However, its compilation is horribly slow, programming styles vary wildly, and I find its tools e.g., SBT, to be underdeveloped.<p>On the other hand, Go has constrained features and complexity, while providing higher-level features like GC, first-class functions, and simple type-inference, along with excellent tools e.g., gofmt and the build system.<p>I don't want to imply that one is simply better than the other, but I have enjoyed working in Go much more than Scala.",1351374866
4707356,comment,4701720,4704665,1,0,malandrew,,,"That's my sentiment as well (as an engineer who formerly worked as an associate analyst on the equivalent of Wall Street in Brazil).<p>The only way I could get behind the financialization of water is if there is the equivalent of a ""Water bill of rights"" which guarantees enough free water to meet the needs of humans using that water for drinking and washing up of cooking equipment. I think this is a guarantee that should extend to every single market/country in which Wall Street wants to trade water. Want to trade water in third-world Country X? Fine, but before you can make any profits, you first must set aside a cut of revenue to subsidize the minimum guaranteed amount of water per person in that country and subsidize the infrastructure to get that water to each citizen.<p>Assuming individuals have a human right to the water they need, the big risk is what trading in water will do to the cost of food. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing as it will force agriculture to start innovating on how they use water, perhaps moving into mass aquaponics or other solutions that minimize water use and buffer society against volatility in food prices due to droughts and mother nature.<p>The main risk of the subsequent rising inflation is how many people it could return to poverty. Again this is somewhere, where I think regulation could be used to shield or subsidize markets where  rising water prices will cause an increase in the number of people living below the poverty line.<p>Overall, the right to earn profits should come with the obligation to prevent poverty and improve the human condition at the bottom.",1351374845

4707354,comment,4706678,4707241,9,0,pron,,,"> This is a part of our society's disconnection from meritocracy<p>I would argue the opposite, but that depends on the elusive definition of ""meritocracy"". When people use that term, they usually mean that people's status or influence is bestowed on them based on their past performance, or ""merit"" (whatever that means). That is, a person is given a position based on his earned ""merit"", and ""merit"" is like some general currency that can be accumulated.<p>The article argues that successful organizations behave differently. They assign, or remove, roles and influence not based on accumulated ""merit"", but based on performance at a very particular task. If you're not good at this specific task, you will be immediately given another, regardless of your past ""merit"". This is not meritocracy where those with much earned ""merit"" rise to the top, but rather an organization where the goals are more important than the current job holders. It is an organization that assigns importance to collective results over the importance of individuals. I think that such an organization is hard to maintain over time because, in the end, it, too, is composed of people, each with their private interests, that may sometimes clash with those of the collective. But it is a far cry from meritocracy, that is, in practice, little more than simply bestowing privilege on horders of ""merit"" rather than horders of money, noble blood, or other more quantifiable currencies. This may actually make meritocracies worse than other privileged-class structures, precisely because those at the top can easily change their definition, and exchange-rate, of ""merit"".<p>At no point does the article suggest that General Franks was promoted, say, because he was someone's relative, or a member of the right party; in fact, nowhere is it suggested that he was promoted for anything but merit. And that is why he wasn't relieved - precisely because he was a ""holder of merit"". This is how meritocracy works. In WWII, someone would possible have told him ""we don't care what you did or can do. At this point, your particular actions are not helping our collective war effort, so you must step aside for a while"".<p>But people like meritocracy, because, for some, ""merit"" isn't hard to achieve. You get the right credentials, put in some talent and a lot of effort, and presto, you're part of the elite. People don't like being judged over and over, be only as good as their last action. They want to rest without losing their status. Only an organization where people truly put aside their egos for the good of the public can function as the article claims the military used to function in WWII.",1351374799

In a larger organization, you may have separation of programming roles so you may not have a 'Kid' at your disposal.<p>If you have a method for rapid prototyping or something which allows you to bash out a quick proof of concept.  Sometimes management needs that as the visual impact goes a long way to getting projects approved.<p>So long as you then convey to others that there are bigger long term concerns and proper design to look into when making the full version you can take it from there.",1351372000

Facebook's platform is so open and easy to get information from people and their friends, that a typical web developer could create an App that requires the user's email address upon signing in via Facebook Connect. Upon successful connection, the developer could write a script to save that email address and post some article about the user using his/her real name. This could get the users attention, attracting their friends. Once they sign in, however, the script will store their email address as well. \nHow long will this work for? Until Facebook denies the rights to your application.<p>If you want to make $5, sell that list to this guy.. again. haha.",1351371996

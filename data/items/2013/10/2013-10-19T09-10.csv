</code></pre>
The problem with this statement is, that a observed object is said to be made of a mathematical abstraction. So in a way, this is saying that a raytracer is made of C. If we look into the ELF binary, we will find shell code, if we look at the computer very closely we will find electrical signals, but we will only find C in the reverse engineered source code. So similarly, the statement should probably read:<p><pre><code>    A proton is described as made of quantum fields. 
</code></pre>
However, it is still important to remind everybody, that the popular analogy of high energy physics, particles which interact much like billiard balls, is a somewhat leaky abstraction. And this question is probably more a expression of this leaking than a question of fundamental physics. If we would make the classical analogy, that a proton is (described as) a stable field configuration, then we would probably not have the question.",1382175397

6575857,comment,6575469,6575469,8,0,danieldk,,,"<i>OO with class hierarchies is a broken model.</i><p>I am not sure whether C++ is a good target for this criticism. The most frequently used libraries (STL and Boost) don&#x27;t use class hierarchies extensively.<p>Also, some domains are easily modelled using class hierarchies, such as GUI widgets, where more specialized widgets override or extend behaviour (or painting) of more general widgets. I have programmed Qt for years, and the class hierarchy model works exceptionally well there.<p><i>Algebraic datatypes and pattern matching have been around for years,</i><p>They come with advantages and disadvantages. E.g. adding a constructor potentially requires you to update every pattern matching case. This can get quite ugly quickly if you add a constructor to some commonly-used library.<p>I do like them in cases where you know up-front what constructors there will be. E.g. lightweight error handling with Maybe/Either. Or when their visibility is limited.<p><i>Parallel programming has been around for years, and is becoming CRITICAL for modern applications. If your language doesnt EASILY support it, it sucks.</i><p>Luckily, parallel programming is <i>very</i> easy in C++ using e.g. OpenMP or Intel TBB. In the case of OpenMP it is usually a matter of adding pragmas to your embarrassingly parallel loops. It is <i>concurrency</i> that is more of a problem. C++11 has standardized lot of &#x27;old-world&#x27; constructs for threading, but it&#x27;s not as if you can find a mature technology like Erlang&#x27;s OTP or Akka on top of C++.<p><i>C++ has a RIDICULOUS amount of boiler plate.</i><p>I agree that there is a lot of boilerplate. But then the author goes off ranting about constructors. I don&#x27;t find it that convincing. There used to be a lot of boilerplate in iterator and <algorithm> use, but C++11 makes things much more compact with auto et al. IMO one of the biggest sources of boilerplate in C++ is writing libraries such that you have ABI compatibility. You usually end up using PIMPL for every class, maintaining two versions (PIMPL and actual) of each class.<p>Then, there are other languages that come with a lot of boilerplate, such as Java, but the difference is that Java is much easier to parse, process, and incrementally compile. As a consequence, Java IDEs tend to be much better at code generation and refactoring than C++ IDEs.<p><i>The same problems that make highly-parallel code a nightmare in C++ also make it an unsuitable language for security-critical, or mission-critical projects. </i><p>Yes, it is extremely easy to blow your foot of. Forgetting a &#x27;virtual&#x27; keyword can lead to subtle, difficult to find bugs. You can read or write beyond bounds by accident. Etc. These are well-known critiques. Use C++ (or another unsafe language) when it&#x27;s necessary to trade off safety for performance. Rust will probably bring performance while sacrificing less safety. But it&#x27;s not there yet.",1382174029

(If it&#x27;s raining generally people are in a really bad mood, few people want to open their door and get cold and see grey. But if it&#x27;s snowing - I always had really good leads when it was snowing. There were like two weeks of snow where I was getting three leads (around 100) a day. In either case though you don&#x27;t want to mention it to people, you want to let them mention it and make a bit of a joke about it.)<p>On the negative side, there are some areas you really don&#x27;t want to work as a girl. At the very least you want to be paired with a man, preferably an older man, when you&#x27;re doing them. A lot of people in those areas are going to tend to look at you as being... owned pretty much... by the man you&#x27;re with. That&#x27;s not a nice feeling but it&#x27;s still preferable to the alternative. I never had anyone grab me but this old guy stroked my hair once and god that was SO creepy.<p>It&#x27;s not a job I was well suited to. I was good at it but emotionally you need a certain degree of detachment or it&#x27;s going to mess you up. A lot of the girls in my team were really cold deep down, covered over with a sort of brittle humour. When you hear someone joking all the time, blustering about how tough they are, it&#x27;s generally been my experience that it&#x27;s a sign of severe insecurity. Almost like they&#x27;re reassuring themselves. Some very rough backgrounds getting by on their wits there. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they really were tough, they weren&#x27;t lying about that. But unfortunately when you go into things with the short-term idea that you can get yourself out of them because, &quot;hey, wits,&quot; you&#x27;ll almost inevitably end up getting yourself into situations where you&#x27;re <i>obliged</i> to get yourself out of them. To a large extent a pride in your wits seems to arise from a lack of a plan.<p>Some girls let other girls stay with them when they were having particularly bad times at home, and I saw that end poorly a couple of times. Some of those people are predators, that&#x27;s the thing you&#x27;ve got to remember. When you invite a predator into your home; put your arm in their mouth; you can&#x27;t be that surprised when you get bitten.<p>So, yeah. I think there are things about being a girl that make the job slightly different in some respects. Not hugely so but noticeably.<p>Also wear flats, the extra height can be nice but walking in heels for six hours isn&#x27;t fun. ^_^",1382173883

4535320,comment,4534359,4535149,12,0,geuis,,,"We aren't talking about time travel. So many people confuse the idea of FTL with time travel. General Relativity talks about frames of reference.<p>Suppose you had a base on Mars and sent a radio signal to it from Earth. It would take between 4.3 to 21 minutes to reach Mars, depending on its distance from Earth at the time.<p>If you simultaneously jumped in your 10x warp drive and set out, you would arrive at Mars in 25.8 seconds to 1min 26 seconds, again depending on distance.<p>In this scenario, there has been no violation of causality. You aren't arriving before you sent your radio signal. All that is happening is that you're arriving before your radio signal does. From the perspective of a telescope or radio antenna at the Mars base, you would view Earth in its state 4.3 to 21 minutes before, because it simply takes that long for the electromagnetic waves to get to you.<p>So yes, you <i>can</i> travel faster than the speed of light without violating causality. If you travel in a relativistic way, i.e. speed all the way up to 99.99999% of light speed, you will most certainly run into time slowing down in your local frame, while it continues at a normal frame back at your departure point.<p>But with a warp drive that works as described in the article, there is no changing of reference frames. Since you're warping space itself, the spacecraft isn't actually undergoing acceleration in the relativistic way of a rocket. For passengers on board, the clocks are going to run at the same rates as back home.",1347922350

I don't think I have to spend any time at all going out on a fishing expedition finding you examples of software that does it right to argue that at this point browser updates should be getting their own channel from MS. (Just in case I really have to spell it out: treating operating system updates as exactly equivalent to browser updates is stupid.

The reason being that I make extensive use of the vimium Chrome plugin (similar to pentadactyl on Firefox), which maps common vim keys to useful browser shortcuts (j/k to scroll, shift-j/k to switch tabs, f to enable a ""type to click links"" mode, etc). On 99% of the websites I use, I almost never need to touch the mouse, which is a especially appreciated when using a laptop with a nub mouse.<p>When websites use these common vim keybindings in an attempt to be helpful or ""hacker cool"", they completely bork my browsing setup until I disable the plugin for that site. My experience after that is usually a mix of awkwardly readjusting to the default browsing setup and reflexively trying to use vimium hotkeys and being surprised when they do something completely different. So, while Google Reader gets much ""hacker"" praise for its vim hotkeys, they make the site a lot more difficult to use for me -- there, accidentally hitting my ""scroll down"" button will scroll to the next article and make me lose my place, for example.<p>To web app developers, I completely understand that vim users that use plugins like vimium are a niche within a niche and not all that important in the grand scheme of things, but we would very much appreciate it if you bury the option to disable vim hotkeys somewhere in your site's settings menu. Very few people may be affected if you don't do this, but to those that are, it's even more frustrating than sites that remap the arrow keys, use touch events on mobile browsers, break ""middle click to open in a new tab"" functionality for no good reason by using javascript onclick events instead of standard anchor tags, or break pagedown functionality by covering up the top part of the document with a giant floating ""like this on twitbook"" bar.",1347920051

You only need one guy with the skills to take his monitor apart and modify it to feed the input into the actual OLEDs into another device. Once that happens it's game over.<p>The only way to really win would be prevent consumer playback devices from actually playing DRM Free content at all and insist that all content is signed.

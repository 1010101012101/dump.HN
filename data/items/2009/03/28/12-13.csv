The RepRap project is still very difficult to a novice user, and has a long way to go. Bre Pettis actually just started a company called <a href=""http://www.makerbot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.makerbot.com/</a> MakerBot that is working on a more commercialized RepRap. Definitely something to checkout, since they are shooting for a sub $1000 price point.",1238245013

What song should I listen to (linking to iTunes)..<p>sounds fair enough - if they can stick to it.<p>(to clarify - If you are being sponsored/monitized by the retailer and not the manufacturer - then some recommendations would be pretty legit (you'd have incentive to suggest the best song/book))  Remembering though that any attempt to ask ""where should I buy my books / music - will then conflict with that relationship with apple/amazon/etc.",1238243975
536415,comment,536310,536310,0,0,zupatol,,,"I just read the fifth child by Doris Lessing, a novel about a family destroyed by a child who is a 'throwback', a kind of neanderthal, or troll. On amazon, there is a comment from a woman who claims to have lived through that, which made me really wonder. Real life trolls?<p>And now in this article an autist is described as a warty monster from a Grimm fairy tale, and I suddenly understand what this novel is about. I am a little shocked to see an autist portrayed as a troll in a horror story.",1238243782

536404,comment,535830,535887,0,0,jlees,,,"Stuff seems slightly different here (in the UK), at least based on what I've heard from students in the US and absorbed through popular culture (ha).<p>I didn't have my own laptop most of the time I was an undergrad, and although students these days tend to have them rather than desktops, I don't see that many carrying them around/taking them to lectures/tutorials. Certainly if a student I taught whipped out their laptop I'd be amazed.<p>I was taught computer science at a fairly 'traditional' institution where we learned from OHPs, Powerpoint and printed notes rather than live code demos that you could type out on your laptop and play with while the lecturer was talking. (I recently went to a tutorial day that was run like this and it was amazing; I'm not necessarily advocating learning to code on paper, but it does help you pass exams where you have to write code on paper..)<p>Anyway, without computer labs many people out and about on campus wouldn't have e-mail or 'net access, and as others have pointed out it let us run a pretty complex setup for teaching (ML and Java through some insane whacked-out emacs customisation; to this day I use vim as a result of that teaching). I guess the general 'labs as somewhere the general student body goes to write essays aren't needed' applies, but a nice quiet room full of the sound of people typing is a great environment to get work done, and at least at the universities I'm familiar with in the UK, there's not much room for laptops. Plus laptops have distractions on, and lab machines don't.",1238242446

536401,comment,535797,536101,0,0,unalone,,,"Speaking as a guy who was single when he got a Mac, has dated since getting his Mac, and is single once again, the Mac has nothing to do with dating unless you're really desperate and willing to go after would-be hipsters. In fact, dating has no consideration when getting a Mac. You get it because it's a beautiful machine that feels wonderful.<p>I have a sinking suspicion that the people who are that sensitive to beautiful things get more dates than people who have less taste in things, but the two are not directly correlated.",1238241963
536400,comment,535835,535898,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"I recall spending hundreds of dollars a semester on books. I distinctly remember my Organic Chemistry text was well in excess of $100. The cost of a computer amortized over the entire college experience is not a whole lot compared to other costs. For most people, a netbook would be able to get the job done. It might not be ideal, but you could make it work. Even for CS majors, you could just use a netbook and fire up an EC2 small instance if you needed something more powerful. You can get a lot done on EC2 before hitting the price of two slices of pizza and a coke.",1238241838

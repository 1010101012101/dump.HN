Ultimately the stealth of the F35 is not enough of an advantage to make up for the downsides of the aircraft. In any force on force engadgment the F35 will run out of missiles and run low on fuel before the enemies, and then it will be forced to run away. A condition where the vehicle is less stealthy and also where it&#x27;s slower speed is a huge disadvantage, so it&#x27;ll just get shot out of the sky.

As a Dutch person I sympathize with your frustration, but just like the majority of the Dutch do <i>not</i> generalize like you describe I&#x27;d appreciate it if you did not generalize either. Because by generalizing like that you are positioning yourself more like the percentage of the Dutch that I&#x27;d rather not associate with than the rest of us, effectively making yourself part of the problem, not part of the solution.<p>That said I fully agree that this society needs to work on a lot of things such as immigration, all kinds of glass ceilings, discrimination (in fact, not on paper) and a ton of other aspects in which we are far from perfect. We used to be a fairly tolerant society and in the last decade or so have thrown away long term progress for some cheap political slogans and finger pointing. A single party is responsible for a lot of this and has successfully driven a wedge into our otherwise tolerant society.<p>This is a fairly common element historically, whenever there is some degree of trouble it can pay off politically to find a scape-goat. But please continue to see it for what it is: an appeal to the baser nature of those that are not smart enough to see through it and judge the rest of us by our actions rather than by the words of our co-citizens.<p>Thank you.",1403084669

I slammed it down before it could get out of control and it still managed to cut a really nasty gash into the wood before it finally stopped moving.

I roam around the office, spend time with people from other departments, discussing things, solving issues, etc. I learned early on how detrimental a geek&#x27;s profession is to their health and body. Not only your eyes, wrists, and your back, but your entire body is at risk. As we read so often, our bodies were never made to be forced to remain in a sitting posture for a considerable length of time. Obviously, it didn&#x27;t descend on me from nowhere. I learned the value of proper ergonomics and proper health management the hard way. Bad eye-sight, headache, migraines, yadda yadda. But I&#x27;m glad I learned it before things got out of hand.<p>I also try and follow a 7-minute workout routine every morning. Apart from that, I&#x27;m an active tennis player -- although, after having joined a work-from-office job (since a year), I&#x27;ve been getting less time to be on the courts than I&#x27;d like.",1403082202

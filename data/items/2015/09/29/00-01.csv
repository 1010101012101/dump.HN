One instruction, MPPEM, requests the pixels per em.  Another instruction, MPS, gets the current point size.  There are also instructions to find pixel lengths across various axes.  I&#x27;d have to think about the details but it should be possible to estimate the DPI and physical glyph size from those and then adjust the hinting accordingly.",1443488307

10294170,comment,10290436,10290436,0,0,e12e,,,"I just wish there was an officially supported way to get set up with a kotlin-first Android project from the command line. So far the best documentation I&#x27;ve seen is:<p><a href=""http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html</a><p>Which a) requires one use the IDE. Maybe not surprising from a company that sells IDEs, but it&#x27;s not my dream environment. b) Even then, one is asked to manually &quot;replace java kode with kotlin&quot; (with help of a wizard). Couldn&#x27;t we just get a script/function that&#x27;ll set up a project targeting the desired Android API level?<p>It&#x27;d be nice if kotlin provided a script/command-line utility that basically allowed the equivalent of:<p><pre><code>  android create project -a Main -p hello \\n   -k com.example.app\n   -t android-15 -g -v 1.3.1\n  cd hello/\n\n  # Note that even android sdk is broken,\n  # one needs to manually change:\n  #\n  #  runProguard false\n  #\n  # to\n  #\n  #   minifyEnabled false\n  #\n  # in build.gradle\n\n  gradle build\n  # Start emulator (android avd...)\n  # possibly (re)start adb server\n  #\n  adb install ./build/outputs/apk/hello-debug.apk \n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m still figuring out the Android/java command-line/build workflow, but I suppose one <i>should</i> be able to drop the kotlin.jar somewhere, and add something to build.gradle. I&#x27;ve yet to find any documentation how how to do that (official or otherwise).<p>Am I really the only one that wants a predictable, scriptable environment in which I can both initiate development from scaffolding supported by upstream, and have a reasonable grasp over the entire build process?<p>I mean, we all want to automate this for Continous Integration, right?",1443488213

Kind of like what Google has as an alternative to seeing its ads (can&#x27;t recall the name). Medium would be an ideal platform for this. Put a monthly fee into medium (maybe you choose how much), or just give your credit card and set a cap on how much you can spend per month, and then when you visit posts on medium, the authors get paid out based on visits and percentage read (or something similar).

10294146,comment,10290813,10293943,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Adobe used to have this feature in their typeface format and type design tools in the 1990s. The format was called “Multiple Master”, see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_master_fonts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_master_fonts</a> and <a href=""http://blog.typekit.com/2014/07/30/the-adobe-originals-silver-anniversary-story-how-the-originals-endured-in-an-ever-changing-industry/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.typekit.com/2014/07/30/the-adobe-originals-silve...</a>. (Metafont also has this feature.)<p>In practice, type designers found that making such fonts took dramatically more work, and typographers/publishers weren’t willing to pay commensurately more money. So it didn’t see much adoption outside Adobe.<p>As a result, the format died out, and we stuck with descendants of the original PostScript font format.<p>More recently, many companies (but especially Adobe) ship “pro” typefaces with separate fonts for various “optical sizes”. Again, producing these takes a lot of extra work, so most type designers don’t bother with it, and because it is designed to work with standard tools (which don’t have special knowledge of the feature), typographers/designers must explicitly choose which optical size they want to use in each context. So in theory it’s inferior to the Multiple Master format, but in practice it is backwards compatible, which ends up being more important.<p>Apple can solve this problem for their UI fonts specifically, because they have full control. Unfortunately, they haven’t offered these features for use with other typefaces.",1443487684

I have this written already and feel a little silly now, but I figure the links are good and worth posting.]<p>I am finishing up my undergraduate right now in psychology, and while I want to defend the work that is being done by cognitive psychologists on concepts at higher levels of abstraction (Many researchers working in more mathematical areas of psychology tend towards working on things like consciousness, perception, concepts and categorization. There are cool advances in it, but I won&#x27;t go too much into it in this post. I guess I&#x27;m just trying to say that you end up working with constructs that have higher barriers of entry to communicating outside of groups of researchers who get excited about modeling and the perceptual measurement theory.) I digress with that though. The main reason I wanted to comment is that your comment on understanding things like pointing hit on one of my favorite areas of psychology that has tragically always been somewhat nitch, but provides a lot of interesting connections between different areas if you take the time to get into it. There is a thread in the field of psychology that does just this kind of research, termed sometimes ecological psychology. It is often referred to colloquially as Gibsonian psychology, termed after [JJ Gibson](<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Gibson"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Gibson</a>) who is seen as the father of the field(its practitioner&#x27;s are known colloquially as Gibsonians).<p>I was lucky enough to take the Geoffrey Bingham&#x27;s (who specializes reach to grasp behavior iirc) Perception/Action course a few years back, and found it immensely rewarding.* The primary text for the course was JJ Gibson&#x27;s classic book &quot;The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception&quot;. The philosophical foundations of gibsons theory of affordances is to take a realist approach to perception. (Avoiding the troubles that mind-body dualism imposes; taking a more Heidegerrian approach). The classic mantra of the field is ask not what is in you&#x27;re mind, but what you&#x27;re mind is in. \nI wish I had time to say more now, but I need to run here.\nBut I&#x27;ll leave you with a few snippets of what I took away from the course, and some links I think you&#x27;ll enjoy,  and can furnish more if you would be interested.<p>The Archival Gibson Video Series (Whoever assembled these had perfect choice in music)<p>[Reversibility and event perception](<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVLny6Ymsk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVLny6Ymsk</a>)<p>[Optical Transitions:Visible To Invisible](<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qQLtIICXoE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qQLtIICXoE</a>)<p>[Motion Paralax and Percieved Depth](<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVSaWXqQh0w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVSaWXqQh0w</a>)<p>Disclaimer I haven&#x27;t watched this video, but the idea that perception of throw-ability may explain size weight illusions is a surprising one.<p>[Geoff Bingham - Haptics: throwing and the size-weight \nillusion](<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud9JB4NYUvA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud9JB4NYUvA</a>)<p>* I really need to digitize those notes...<p>Btw: Awesome Arm.",1443487605

Most developed countries have definitions that put around 10% of people as functionally illiterate, but also have definitions that put 20-30% of people as having very low levels of literacy, in fact the study that put Detroit at 47% puts it at roughly 25% nationwide. Further, this rate is based on an extrapolation from data from 25 years ago, done 22 years ago.<p>Lastly, the literacy as the study defines it is based on a Congressional act which stipulates literacy in English. Those who don&#x27;t know English are considered functionally illiterate in this study (and many others), despite being fully able to read and write in another language. e.g. read Spanish news, email, things at work, cooking recipes, software, manuals for their electronics. This obviously isn&#x27;t optimal, government letters in English wouldn&#x27;t be readable directly, but it&#x27;s a world of difference compared to someone who is fully illiterate (which is a proxy for general education, too, and in this case often not applicable due to literacy/education in another language).<p>Lastly the 47% figure carries a warning that it has confidence intervals larger than (-)5 at the 95% confidence level, how much it doesn&#x27;t say but not a single other city carries this warning except one which has a 57% figure, and the rest of the country (and similar socioeconomic areas) are half the rate, so I would be completely uncomfortable ever citing this figure even in the context of 25 year old data, without at least finding out the actual confidence interval.",1443487040

The justice system merely upholds the law set down and doles out what the law defines as a &#x27;just&#x27; punishment or judgment.<p>A law can say literally anything, like, &quot;Black people may not marry White people&quot;, or &quot;Women may not vote&quot;, &quot;Gay people may not get married&quot;, etc. Or they can say things like &quot;At an intersection, the left-most lane may turn left onto the street it intersects with, but not the right-most lane.&quot; It can say anything; it doesn&#x27;t have to do with &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;justice&quot;, it has to do with maintaining order.<p>The laws, once put down, are enforced, as long as they remain laws. The results of those laws being enforced will only stop once the laws are abolished (and even then, sometimes the states just like to keep going with &#x27;em even if they&#x27;ve been abolished anyway).<p>We can&#x27;t just selectively enforce or not enforce laws. Then there would be no point to the law. Then literally any local government official, judge, court, president, etc could abuse the rights of citizens or allow people to go free simply because they felt like it. And that&#x27;s not in the public interest.<p>Therefore, laws which are deemed to be unfair or unjust must be amended or abolished. But - and this is the important part - they must simply be made by decree by will of the representatives of the public, and must not always meet a measurement of justice or fairness. Not only because there are plenty of laws which simply define what the proper procedures of daily life are, but because we&#x27;d literally never get any laws passed if we had to have a philosophical discussion about the potential pros and cons of the impact of the law on justice as a general idea.<p>So why are they forcing him to make an unfair choice? Laws aren&#x27;t designed to be fair. Only the consequence of the law can be fair, according to that law. In this case, if you ask a guy if he wants to live, and he says, &quot;No&quot;, is it fair to give him death, assuming he was of sound mind and body and understood the consequences of his decision?<p>Yeah.",1443485989

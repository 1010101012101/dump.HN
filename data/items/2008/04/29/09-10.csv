176437,comment,176366,176366,0,0,meredydd,,,"So...Skype dropped the ball (didn't develop a mobile client), got their asses handed to them (by iSkoot, which did, and got a Hutchison partnership out of it) - and then decided to catch up cheap by making their own, rather than buying the startup.<p>So why should Skype buy iSkoot - especially now they've fully duplicated their one big asset? The article doesn't really make much of a case.<p>I can understand the sympathy with iSkoot, as the startup underdog - but they <i>were</i> playing in Skype's back yard, in territory that really should have belonged to the bigcorp from the start, and so it should surprise nobody when the gorilla chooses to ""build, not buy"". (Especially for such a relatively simple product...)",1209463051

I'd love to see a follow-up that deals with the ""Sideways Heaps"" that Knuth discusses in his last ""Computer Musings"" lecture (on video at <a href=""http://scpd.stanford.edu/scpd/students/Dam_ui/pages/ArchivedVideoList56K.asp?Include=musings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scpd.stanford.edu/scpd/students/Dam_ui/pages/Archived...</a>)",1209463045

176432,comment,175609,175999,0,0,willarson,,,"In mentioning that its ""the new things that give you an edge,"" are you suggesting that web2py is one of those new things? In what non-trivial way do you feel that it differentiates itself from the literally hundreds of other web frameworks?<p>Examining the documentation I found the unsatisfying answer: ""web2py is better because it is faster, it is easier to use, and it is stable and always backward compatible.""",1209461103

My kids all grew up using linux (No windows really allowed in our house).<p>""Any moron can get around Windows with no prior instructions.""\nReally not true. How often do people search and search for the right sub menu to change some hidden setting? What about the constant registry issues not to mention viruses etc<p>99% of the population don't download and install programs. Sorry, but they don't. So your argument makes no sense. For 99% of the population, as long as they can run firefox, office prog + email, they're all set. In which case Windows, Linux, OSX all work for the average joe.",1209460653

And whether it succeeds or fails, it will provide a real-world test of those assertions that ideas really are worthless, rather than just highly illiquid assets.<p>I think they have at least a decent chance - provided that the tech guys get a sufficient proportion of the equity they take that they have skin in the game.

176424,comment,176251,176343,0,0,boucher,,,"DMGs auto mount by default if you use Safari (which the kind of people you're worried about would be doing).  When they do, the window also automatically opens presenting them right away with the application.<p>In the best case, they could just click on it and the right thing would happen.  This works, but the results aren't what you'd expect usually, since the app will go away once the dmg is gone.  The exception to this is Delicious Library 2 (unreleased), the only app I know of that will tell the user the app was loaded from the disk image, and offer to put it in /Applications for you.<p>In the second best case, you are given the shortcut, and you manually drag it yourself.  Then you click applications, and then you click the app.  Perhaps a little convoluted.<p>In the worst case(and by worst I mean, worst assuming the standard default configuration), you aren't presented with the applications folder link and you end up dragging it anywhere -- perhaps the Desktop.  But, if you do that, the app still works!  That's the beauty of the app bundle, it doesn't matter where you launch it from.<p>Could the whole process be refined? Yes.  And developers are actively making it better (just like they are actively making things like upgrades better with Sparkle).  I for one, though, still think its much more friendly than any windows installation with its ridiculous wizards, shortcuts added to four different locations, and the mess that is the windows registry.",1209459783

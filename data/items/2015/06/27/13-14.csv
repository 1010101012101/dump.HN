Yes, the &quot;aid&quot; is just further loans (with lower rates), that are piled up on the previous debt (with interest on them repaid normally all these years).<p>Second, the aid goes this way: from EU taxpayers and the Greek state (its payback to the aid loans), to EU banks. The aid money are not given to Greek government to pay salaries, etc. or any such purose. They go directly to the creditors. Like the &quot;too big to fail&quot; Wall Street bailout, this is too about siphoning money to central European banks to protect them from toxic assets they had accumulated.<p>Third, this &quot;non-aid&quot; aid (essentially letting Greece near-default and then lenting them money month-to-month to repay its debt under certain conditions), was used to bully Greece to take a number of tax hikes, austerity measures etc, who killed its economy (30% unemployment and up to 50% youth unemployment, 40% loss of wages, etc) to give money for the &quot;aid&quot; loans (which never touched Greece), and to<p>Fourth, all this is even more damning considering that Germany in WWII invaded Greece, resulting in 700.000 deaths from famine, thousands of deaths from executions, and massive destruction of infrastructure. They also took a &quot;loan&quot; from the occupied country, which they never repaid, without also repaying their war recuperations. Germany was absolved from doing so in the early fifties, despite the harm they caused to Greece, because they were new cold war darlings and valuable US allies (and ditto for Eastern Germany / USSR). And what could Greece do about it anyway?<p>Here are some thinking points:\n<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2012/02/21/greek-bailout-deal-a-farce-to-benefit-banks-at-the-expense-of-greece/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2012/02/21/greek-b...</a><p><a href=""http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/06/29/spain-germany-bailout-ifr-idINL6E8HTFC820120629"" rel=""nofollow"">http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/06/29/spain-germany-bailo...</a>",1435412986

That still assumes one <i>set</i> of trust that used globally, which is completely incorrect.<p>Maybe I don&#x27;t trust $COUNTRY to handle their root certificate for most uses. Currently we handle that case by removing the cert completely. Trust, however, is <i>not</i> a simple boolean value, and maybe I do trust that certificate for $COUNTRY&#x27;s official government pages. I should be able to specify that I trust some certificate for some domain (or other, non-domain based use!), but not for others.<p>As another example, consider a local Web Of Trust. whenever Web Of Trust is brought up, people complain about the difficulty of key exchange. Well yes, that&#x27;s a difficult problem, but there is no reason that it has to be solved for <i>all</i> use-cases before anybody starts using it. Maybe a circle of (usually physically local) local friends want to have secure communications. They can share a key in person easily, and so it should be easy to give access to a private forum by simply sharing a key/cert on a USB disk.<p>We can currently <i>approximate</i> those cases, but it is not well supported, and is certainly not something that most users would be expected to be able to do. We can fix some of that with a better UI, but I&#x27;m suggesting a far more fundamental change, because actually solving problems like key sharing will not be easy, and I suspect they will only be solved once we have <i>infrastructure</i> in place. HTTP was successful because it did <i>not</i> require that everybody implements the full, fairly complex specification. Instead, we had a fluid, extensible protocol that allowed <i>anybody</i> to extend it, and that allowed for the development of a wide variety of software.<p>The problem with traditional PKI (at least as implemented) is that it assumes that we can assign an absolute trust value to <i>anything</i>. In reality, trust is relative, and may in fact have multiple values at the same time. Until software is designed around those realities, it will always be inflexible and insecure for any use case where the needed trust assumptions do not reflect the assumptions made by the authors the software.<p>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m a old-style UNIX nerd who is fine with using GPG, and I&#x27;m not sure what the UI for a dynamic-trust system would even look like. <i>sigh</i>",1435412961

Extending UTF-8 with surrogates like this is intended to be temporary, only used until the pre-2003 2.1 billion codepoint limit for UTF-8 and UTF-32 is reinstated by the Unicode Consortium. Then any software using UTF-88 can easily swap the encoding to the 1 to 6-byte sequences in &quot;reinstated&quot; UTF-8. This surrogation scheme is actually intended for UTF-16 to use as a second-tier surrogate scheme so it can encode the same number of codepoints as UTF-8 and UTF-32. I wrote all this under &quot;Rationale&quot; at the bottom of the linked page, did you read that far?<p>Hopefully, though, UTF-16 will be on its way out when pre-2003 UTF-8 and UTF-32 are reinstated so this surrogation scheme wouldn&#x27;t even see much use there.",1435412483

At home I have a Chromebox with FreeBSD and a fully encrypted disk. I have a VPS with an OpenVPN server and the required ports are forwarded to my own box. IMAP and SMTP submission require TLS so those are fully covered. Like you said though, the only thing you can&#x27;t reasonably forcibly encrypt is SMTP itself. Most of the mail I receive comes with STARTTLS but not all.<p>With this setup the VPS provider can&#x27;t see anything when SMTP happens with STARTTLS.

For instance, some people in their 60&#x27;s see that they don&#x27;t need a big house anymore and could use the extra money on their retirement plans. The tricky thing about houses is that they serve a purposes while can be used as an investment tool.<p>> As the house and underlying materials get older, maintenance and replacement costs go up, so eternal appreciation is questionable.<p>True, but in many cases what changes the value is not the house itself but the land where it is located. I agree with other commenter though, this should be a evaluated in a case by case fashion, and my over-simplification was just for discussion&#x27;s sake.<p>> I understand the long-term statistics are on your side, I&#x27;m just trying to understand the rationality of microeconomics behind it.<p>And you are right, in the short term it doesn&#x27;t makes sense because it assumes you&#x27;d pay with cash and there are better tool for investment. But if you need a place to live it might make sense to buy a house under certain conditions (you plan to stay in the area for a long time, the economy is not under a bubble, etc.)",1435410795

Not on paper, of course, but by using a real compiler/scripting engine. On the other hand, it may not necessarily be that much of a good test. Very often problems that may initially look insurmountable -- real-life problems -- just need to be put at rest for a while, until new inspiration comes along. At that point, the problem may even become trivial to solve. Joel&#x27;s test could of course revolve around simplistic fizzbuzz questions. This type of questions will, however, not say that much about a candidate&#x27;s real abilities. How to set up a code writing test that will accurately measure programming skills?",1435410659

8023638,comment,8021925,8021925,2,0,Throwaway823,,,"This reminds me of a weird calling issue I came across, but mine is obviously unrelated. I needed to make calls from America to Australia (inquiring about apartments from the Australian equivalent of Craiglist), so I was using a calling card that I typically use for calls around North America.<p>I make the first call to Australia, and the apartment was suppose to be owned by a woman looking for a roommate. Anyway, a man picks up the line and says hello. I can hear a woman in the background talking, and dogs barking. I ask for the woman by name, and the man says to hold on one second. Then he starts arguing with the woman for a minute, returns to the line and asks if I&#x27;m still there, and then says to hold one moment, and now you hear the dogs barking louder, and it sounds like he&#x27;s taking them outside because the woman is complaining. There&#x27;s also a TV or radio in the background. I think he returns again a couple of minutes later, apologizes and asks me to wait longer, but I can&#x27;t be certain. I remember after about 5 or 10 minutes I decided to hang up because I&#x27;m calling long distance, the man sounded rude, and it didn&#x27;t seem like a place I&#x27;d like to live any way.<p>Now, I call a few other places throughout the week, and get a few people on the line, and others with weird connection errors saying the numbers can&#x27;t be reached.<p>Then, I&#x27;m making a call to a number in a completely different city a few thousand kilometers away, and the same man from before answers. He asks me to hold one second, and I don&#x27;t recognize the voice at first. Suddenly, I hear the TV, radio and the dogs barking again, and get this weird sense of deja vu as things start to repeat. I hang up. I now realize it&#x27;s a recording, and I never talked to a real person the first time around. But... I&#x27;m calling a completely unrelated number, so how did I get this message again? I call the number back, and now it goes through to the actual person I was trying to reach.<p>This would continue to happen on future calls, but by then I knew the routine and would hang up and redial.<p>Any idea what was happening here? I used these calling cards all the time and never had an issue. Somehow my calls were getting sent to this recorded message when calling Australia, regardless of the number I was dialing. The recording was trying to keep me on the line for an extended period of time.<p>My only conclusion is that these cards are getting rerouted through another country or less than trustworthy business. They then forward a certain percentage of calls to this message in order to get longer call times, and higher profits.",1405136452

8023636,comment,8019918,8020221,2,0,overLourde,,,"Is that a serious question, or are you offering up a snarky &quot;yeah, and so what if they did, who cares&quot; style argument?<p>The answer is: a lot<p>But really you need to possess the capacity to conceive of at least one example of some selfish desirable evil, before you can grasp the vast potential this potent advantage of pervasive eavesdropping offers.<p>The elementary starting point in all these eavesdropping shenanigans is to imagine someone cheating at a simple card game. If you&#x27;re the dealer, and your opponent is betting real money on the outcome of the game, would it be fair for you to look at his hand, or worse, stack the deck in you favor before the game even starts?<p>But population control goes way beyond the elementary sneaking of e-mails and phone calls. Total population control would carry profound and harsh realities with it, like eugenics, human experimentation, blood sports and human spectacle, secret prisons, human trafficking, sex slaves, disappearances. Trivial things like stock market manipulation become absurd, meaningless anachronisms, as corruption is endemic to the scenario. Extrajudicial killings, summary executions, sovereign leaders can wave their fingers and have people put to death.<p>What&#x27;s it like to be a slave? That&#x27;s what the ass end of total poulation control looks like. It&#x27;s like being an olympic athlete for Iraq, and then coming home to be tortured by Saddam junior when you lose.<p>For those that benefit from total population control, every decadence awaits.<p>But, perhaps your rhetorical question is something along the lines of the &quot;human rights are inalienable, and it would be impossible for them to do special terrible things, beyond the terrible things we normally fear like chemical warfare and nuclear annihilation&quot;<p>Actually, no. Under a regime of technologically enabled total population control, there would emerge a class structure so rigid and inescapable that essentially a very small number of people would be born into a lavish, but paranoid existence, and the rest of the world would suffer a permanent crushing misery, that starts with ordinary poverty and gets worse. All of it enforced by geosynchronous satellites and atomic clocks with nearly the precision of spinning neutron stars.<p>Keep in mind that this would be a new age of technologically enforced, drone enabled population control. A North Korean gulag is bad, and it probably doesn&#x27;t get much worse than being an elderly uncle to the dear leader, and still meeting an end by kangaroo court trial and an execution where your ripped apart by dogs.<p>Unless of course, the dogs are robot dogs manufactured by Boston Dynamics (oh, wait I mean Google). But maybe they&#x27;re just drones armed with ever more accurate hellfire missiles. And that pretty much sums up the blue sky possibilities, if we fail to preserve the old-world checks and balances that are quickly disintegrating in the face of advances in modern technology. Completely obedient robotic systems enabling a truly air tight subjugation of humantity beneath an ever watchful panopticon. And wealth disparities that look like an abyssal cliff separating hollywood visions of the future from the stone age, and sociopaths enforcing the existence of the cliff perhaps for sheer amusement, narcissism, or whatever irrational human foible (bodily fluids, mandrake) worms it&#x27;s way to the surface of the human factors that control these things that now influence our lives.<p>How many drones can be controlled from a single data center? How many drones would we need to enforce a permanent world-wide police state, and surveillance apparatus?<p>Technology is a force multiplier, and it permits fewer and fewer people to achieve a great deal, and possibly much more, far beyond what we&#x27;ve considered &quot;super human&quot; in the past. But worse yet, it can mutate innocuous well-meaning intentions in perverse ways. Thermonuclear bombs and missiles have kept a lid on serious global warfare for more than 50 years, but only by virtue of two psychotic power structures promising to vaporize each other at a twitch. Is that &quot;good&quot;?<p>But let&#x27;s say the worst happens, and an evil megalomaniacal cabal implements a true robot armageddon. Wouldn&#x27;t such a terrible sociopathic technocratic regime just cut to the chase, and kill off every last human being that dissents? Probably yes. But only if artificial intelligence proves to be a stalwart companion, otherwise much of the general population of humanity would be permitted to live, if for no other reason than fear of lonliness and inbreeding, but undoubtedly humanity would still be subjugated at the whim of the technocracy.<p>Anyway, to sum up, part of the story would be a short violent transistion phase, followed by a miserable but infinitely stable, robot-reinforced tyrrany. Like a marvel team-up of Kim Jong Il and son along with Saddam, Uday and Qusay all chanting &quot;O&#x27;doyle rules!&quot; while eating hot dogs and drinking Big Gulps and watching robots rape political disidents to death in a stadium filled with their genetically engineered clones and sex slaves.<p>Dare to dream.",1405136381

You brought up mens rea elsewhere in the thread but it hardly seems relevant at the end of the day. Someone with a clear intent to screw his employees certainly is more despicable and villainesque, but the practical impact on the employees is the same even if he did so unintentionally.<p>And we can frown upon it all the same, because it&#x27;s not as if he did something innocent with unforeseen side effect - the agreement was illegal, and the fact that it was secret suggests everyone involved knew this.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m maybe willing to believe that Ed Catmull didn&#x27;t go out there with the explicit intent of screwing his employees. He may have engaged in this agreement in protection of his company, or of his work, but ultimately he (and every other SV CEO involved) kept it hush-hush because they knew it was illegal and immoral, and that the wider world would cry foul at what they were doing.<p><i>Mens rea</i> would make the morality of this more open and shut, but I do not believe it is critical to our ability to judge the impact and legacy of these actions.<p>> <i>&quot;Frequent poaching is often considered unsportsmanlike competition by business people; I know several of the companies I&#x27;ve been affiliated with have felt that way.&quot;</i><p>But yet this isn&#x27;t a game.

The demonization of him I&#x27;m seeing in this thread is disappointing because a large percentage of the people doing the pitchfork-waving would have done the exact same thing in his position. All sufficiently complex systems (the movie industry certainly one of them) evolve complex rules and strategies, and it&#x27;s remarkably easy to get lost in them and forget that these systems are built on top of people.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to think of people who do bad things as &quot;evil men&quot;, because it gives us security: &quot;I&#x27;d never do something like that, phew&quot;. In reality though there are few evil men, but many men who do evil things. The notion that some people are capable of evil while others are not is hubris, and is a great way to end up on the wrong side of the morality scale without even knowing it. I personally doubt Ed Catmull ever got out of bed in the morning and decided he was going to screw a bunch of animators and inhibit their careers, but yet it happened, and I&#x27;d encourage all the pitchfork-wavers in this thread to consider that they themselves can just as easily end up in that position, <i>especially</i> if they approach life with the assumption that they&#x27;re one of the Good Guys.",1405135528

You need to bring together a large number of users in a short time, or else everyone abandons your product because none of the friends/files/etc. they want are on the network. A BitTorrent client that can only connect to Tor-enabled peers is therefore doomed from the beginning. You need to be able to connect to all the existing non-Tor peers without compromising your own anonymity, while also providing plenty of incentives for other nodes to switch to Tor (i.e. presumed immunity from the MAFIAA). Maybe after 10 years when everyone is anonymous, then you can drop this &quot;compatibility layer&quot; and go entirely dark.<p>For a similar reason, I support your decision to use Tor instead of I2P.

He frequently makes changes to shared code that affects things I&#x27;m working on without checking with me. In fact, recently, he&#x27;s taken to deleting entire modules of my code that he feels are poorly designed and replacing them with new versions, which often have changed APIs and require work on my part to correct.

When it continued to affect my work, I tried to discuss it with him, using &quot;I&quot; statements and explaining how his behavior impacted me.

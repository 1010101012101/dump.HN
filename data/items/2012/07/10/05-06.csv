I was generally okay with Jira, at times when the backlog was under control, but if there's an issue tracker that can manage several thousand active entries without reducing you to tears, Jira is not it.<p>Bits are nearly free, but human attention is not. Human attention is even <i>smaller</i> than a physical filing system.<p>Issue-tracker interfaces may in theory be ""infinitely malleable"" but that's a yak-shaving exercise waiting to happen. Every minute a team spends redesigning or reconfiguring the issue tracker is a minute they aren't spending working on the product. That's Spolsky's point.<p>Search? When there's <i>one</i> issue in the backlog about the color of the toolbar then search will work great. But then the toolbar acquires a ""color"" palette. And then two years go by, during which people keep bikeshedding aspects of the toolbar. And then one day you'll search for ""toolbar + color"" and up will come fifty entries. Which you will probably have to read.<p>If you're a talented search jockey you can probably construct a better query to whittle down that SERP page, assuming your issue tracker has a Google-quality search backend, which it probably does not. But constructing fancy searches takes time and thought. And there's a garbage-in-garbage-out problem with search: If your issues aren't written with a sufficient level of detail, precision, care, and choice of terminology (and somehow they never are), your search won't distinguish them well. Reporting bugs well takes a lot of time and care. Writing carefully-described issue descriptions with a standard terminology takes time, even if you're a trained library scientist. And, again: All that time spent refining searches, scanning SERP pages, and writing well-crafted issue descriptions for better searchability is time you're not spending on the product.

Their numbers have recently been increased to try an accommodate the increased Monday morning and Friday evening rushes as more people are flying in and out every week. The traffic during the rest of the week has remained fairly constant. This means that profits are lower and so some taxi drivers are getting out of the business. In a free market it's possible that this inflation of service providers could happen unchecked for a time, before it is realised that there is not enough consistent work to support the new drivers. The possibility for extreme fluctuation in service provision is high, and this could have terrible consequences for anyone who happens to need a taxi home on a Wednesday evening after too many drinks at the pub.<p>It is hard to say for sure if a free market would deal with the irregular nature of taxi business in that city better than a regulated market, but I think it is clear that the purpose of a taxi system could be at odds with the outcomes of a free market. A free market could fluctuate between too many and too few providers, removing the reliability that is essential in an effective taxi service, even though the regulated service might provision a greater than optimal service cost.",1341896665

(with some adjustments for carrier subsidies).<p>They did it before with the iPod, from $99, add $50 for more storage, add $50 for a different form factor, and so on, for every price point between $100 and $400.<p>Right now, the iPod touch is at $200, the iPad at 400, and 500-800. Phones are 400-700 w/o subsidies. Pushing the iPad down into the $200 range fills out that array of devices so that there's something for everyone who has a little bit of money to spend.",1341896591

Unless your app depends on the physical size of a point, no redesign is needed.<p>So, you still have two layouts: iPhone/iPod and iPad. You have four graphics resolutions: two for each.<p>Of course, as he said, we'll have to see how this plays out in reality. Maybe a smaller iPad will turn out to suck, and developers who want their apps to be usable on the thing will have to redesign them. It's hard to say without actually testing apps at that size.",1341896510

2410545,comment,2406206,2407897,1,0,DennisP,,,"People forget that there was deflation during the Roaring Twenties, and several economic booms before that.<p>I think there are two kinds of deflation. One is just the currency getting more valuable. The other is deflation due to everyone having to stop and pay down their debts. The latter is horrible because the deflation makes the debt harder to pay off. The former is no big deal.<p>Some economists talk about the ""spiral"" caused by people putting off purchases, since they can get more for their money later. Those economists have yet to explain why people keep buying so many computers, cellphones, and flat screen TVs. If people don't actually put off their purchases in the expectation of lower prices, the spiral argument fails.<p>Finally, it's important to remember that bitcoins are not legal tender, and quite likely never will be. Deflation of one currency in the context of multiple competing currencies is going to have much less of an overall economic effect.",1302004513

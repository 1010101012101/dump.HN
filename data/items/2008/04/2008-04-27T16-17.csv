174921,comment,174890,174890,0,0,swombat,,,"The article is a bit hit-and-miss, but it's an interesting and difficult problem.<p>I personally believe that a lot of the really bad developers came onboard during the y2k+dot-com boom, and the population has been self-perpetuating and growing in enterprise environments ever since.<p>Perhaps the way to resolve this is to create some sort of exclusive society of good developers, which you can only join by personal invitation and after a thorough grilling by some developers who have already joined and who are aware that diluting the society with crap programmers is not in anyone's interest... Something like a Mensa for programmers?<p>Then good developer could be identified by belonging to this society - much like professionals in other professions are identified by memberships to such societies (doctors, lawyers, architects, hell, even engineers).<p>Daniel",1209315215

174915,comment,174893,174905,0,0,goofygrin,,,"I think you were trying to post to the article about these ""contest"" sites being possibly illegal.<p>You know, this is a case where I think that the laws, if being broken, should be broken.<p>I think that these sites are more like ""submitting a request for comps and receiving them"" more than a ""contest.""<p>Now if people are running these ""contests"" and not fulfilling their end of the bargain, then they are bastards and should be caned.<p>But for people in developing countries with great design skills (or people in developed countries that are looking for experience) these ""contests"" provide a much greater potential for income that they normally wouldn't get.<p>I think that a lot of this whining about the legality and ""morality"" of these sites and contests by the establishment (in this case the design firms and professional designers) is simply a case of them being afraid of lower cost alternatives (that might be better than them!).<p>This may be another case of p2p and digital music vs. the recording industry and the RIAA.  There will be some losers (napster) but the cat is already out of the bag.",1209314428
174914,comment,174894,174894,0,0,dhs,,,"Nice concept. I swapped a PDF on Pi-Calculus against a photoshopped Sumo wrestling match and ""The Logic of ARIZ"" against a photo of a very wrinkly old man. Personally, my interest would be sustained for longer if it were a bit more specialized, like if you could blind-swap technical/scientific papers, or short-stories. I'm not so much the photo guy, and this site apperars to be somewhat pic-biased.",1209314377

174912,comment,174775,174870,0,0,petercooper,,,"I guess what you say might be generally true for public facing staff, although I still think friendliness (or fake friendless) can appear when incentivized or required. Examples would be the hotel industry, sales (think prestige car dealerships), and any low-demand hospitality industry generally.<p>This effect is particularly true amongst the self employed who generally want to keep your business. My dentist, for example, is friendly, otherwise he knows I'll go elsewhere. My doctor, however, is not, but he's state-employed so doesn't care whether I stay or not.",1209314359

Maybe they're more ""agency"" than company, maybe in fact their name is an acronym (a lot of times those acronyms have three letters).<p>In that hypothetical example, the situation resolves itself the best way that it could:<p>The ""agency"", after reading your report about some fundamental insecurities in the product, realizes that it is currently deployed in places where the potential damage from the product being insecure is closer to ""people being killed"" than ""money being stolen"". So they pull it ""off the market"".

2403642,comment,2402870,2403367,3,0,samengland,,,"You said it - you are indeed being an arsehole in your comments.<p>Firstly:<p>""...this could be a story about when _not_ to self-finance your startup""<p>That's easier said than done. There is absolutely no point in over analysing the situation and then concluding that TinyGrab should have got ""outside funding"" and ""hired people that know more than they do"" about the technology involved - because what is done, is done. You are seriously insulting the intelligence of everyone behind TinyGrab if you think they don't already know that version one was problematic. The point here is that the popularity of TinyGrab was never predicted or planned and that it grew from strength to strength entirely organically. At no point did they think about scalability from the outset - so they acknowledged the problem and were rectifying this with a full rewrite in TinyGrab 2. They we're simply unlucky in that they were unable to roll this update out quickly enough - they were hacked before they could complete TinyGrab 2, and therefore did the right thing and released TinyGrab 2 which was very nearly complete anyway. With the lack of income and voluntary manpower they had, they couldn't have changed anything in hindsight at all. So in that respect this was not ""full of fail"" as you so crudely put it.<p>Secondly:<p>What you need to do is put yourself in the shoes of those battling to actually keep TinyGrab online, and realise that they are actually trying their best to respond to every support request and resume the excellent level of service their users have come to expect - and frankly they've almost achieved that now.<p>What you also need to realise is that those behind TinyGrab are not in it for commercial gain - they are in it because they love the product and their users.<p>Since this is a completely free service they could have very easily - and might I add completely legally closed TinyGrab as of today, with no risk of litigation against them. They would also most probably refund existing premium users, but would not be legally obliged to.<p>What they have instead chosen to do, is keep this service online, do their best to get TinyGrab 2 to the bare minimum in order to roll it out completely, and work day and night as a team to respond to every support request and @mention on Twitter to keep users informed and solve their issues individually. I think this is absolutely admirable given their 300,000+ user base and could never be described as ""full of fail"" especially since the vast proportion of their users do not pay them a penny - and especially since those behind TinyGrab work in their own free time on the project whilst receiving no commercial gain whatsoever.<p>TinyGrab will easily recover from this over the coming days - all they need at this moment in time is some moral support and some understanding - a bit of slack if you like - not a bunch of anonymous, cynical, patronising and moronic nobodies trying to tell them how it should have been done in hindsight. As I said above, it's frankly just insulting the intelligence of those behind it - any reasonable person can see that they were fully aware of the pitfalls of TinyGrab version one and were trying their best to roll out version two.

You are an experienced waiter and expect to average 18% in tips on 20 plates served over the course of four hours.   Presuming that no one orders alcohol, that's $1440 or $360/hour.  If there were no labor laws and Masa really had a free market system such as this in place, it would be rational for a waiter to pay a great deal for the right to collect these tips given that there are few opportunities available to make this much money relative to the supply of capable servers.<p>I see the internship market as similar.

That's why in my first comment, I said that not creating a new lexical scope for the loop body is the real issue here. I didn't make it especially clear that it doesn't matter whether you do that using an internal iterator or by giving for statements a statement-level scope, but of the two examples I gave of languages with mutable bindings and the ""correct"" (IMO) behavior here, Perl 5 uses the statement-level scope approach, while Perl 6 uses the internal iteration approach(for is very light syntactic sugar for map).<p>I believe I misread your previous comment as suggesting that mutability was the key issue here.

There are still brilliant and insightful comments, and there are many, many good and valuable comments. But there are also many valueless comments that nevertheless get upvotes, and there's definitely a more snarky feel. I've felt myself being dragged into that at times and had to pull myself back.  That didn't used to happen.<p>I also hang about on the ""New"" page because I think the longer-standing members should do that, and I'm really, <i>really</i> tired of the apparently endless repeat submissions of the same stories, endless re-submission of older (although admittedly valuable) items, and the rise in content-free gossip.

It is a known problem and one that the majority of sites obviously don't care about even though they should.<p>The referenced page though, as an example of proper design, is not a good solution. When resizing the window, column widths jump erratically so it is hard to keep your place; and at a comfortable column width, there is so little text it takes but a few seconds to read, and then one has to scroll. Having to scroll every couple of seconds sucks big time, even worse than dealing with small font. Furthermore, he has done something to sabotage the font resizing buttons so when I try to make the text less gargantuan, it retains the text size but inexplicably shrinks the column size. As ghastly and infuriating as sites that make me disable javascript before I can copy text. I am sure his gargantuan text looks nice on his iPhone or whatever high density display device he is using, but it is way too big on a normal screen.<p>Unfortunately, screens are now tied into film aspect ratios (as if this is what you spend most of your hours on), windows for non-film watching applications resize most easily to fill the screen to these film dimensions, toolbars are crammed on top and bottom of applications, using up even more vertical space, and HTML has no flowing multi-column support whatsoever, making good solutions impossible and small font the least worst among many terrible choices.",1301858588

I'm not saying this is acceptable, I'm just suggesting an explanation.<p>I could sort of see not having a completely bulletproof backup strategy in place, but with all the options available, I can't imagine not working with source control.",1301857830

I just recently started really looking at Hacker News (mostly because of my Y Combinator application), but I have been really impressed with the breadth of stuff posted here.<p>I am a molecular biology major and used to do lab research in this area, so I find it fascinating.<p>I will say that the U.S. Patent Office really needs a refresh in terms of who it hires. Both in terms of software patents and molecular biology, it is pretty clear that the people issuing these patents don't understand the core issues.<p>The isolation of a DNA sequence should not be patentable, any more than reading data off a disk drive is patentable. Both these technologies relied on years of publicly funded scientific research and a myriad of different technologies. This company has merely built on those findings.<p>If they have discovered a novel way to analyze the results of a specific sequence, and determined a provable correlation between a specific sequence variant and getting breast cancer, then perhaps this is an invention that deserves patent protection in the form of a commercializable product. In no way should this restrict further research in the area, however. The entire point of the patent system is to trade disclosure for protection. These guys seem like they want to prevent anyone else from researching these genes entirely, which in my mind is just plain selfish and goes against the spirit of the patent system.<p>I agree that there needs to be some benefits to companies that produce novel discoveries in the area of information technology (which is really what we are talking about regarding molecular biology and software patents). Patenting genes is not the way. Patenting software algorithms is not the way.<p>Bottom line: Our legislators need to get off their asses and adapt our laws for the 21st Century. Or we need to find new legislators who will.",1301857672

Selling them on eBay is a pain in the a<i></i>, as you have to take a picture, create the listing, etc. You can try to sell them to some comic shops but they will give you just pennies.

Users will be able to login, click on the comics of the week that they got and did not like and the comics that they did not get and would like to have.<p>I will then match the wants and gives and ask users to ship me the comics. I will check that their grade is ok and ship them to other users.<p>What do you think?",1301857423

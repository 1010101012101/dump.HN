37784,comment,37464,37464,0,0,geebee,,,"how would you categorize something like craigslist, or 37signals?<p>Craigslist clearly didn't intend to be huge at first (it wasn't even sure it wanted to be a web app), and Craig has made it pretty clear that he doesn't intend to IPO or sell (though a big chunk was purchased, by EBay, I think).  Aside from that, it does have the profile of many startups - small, technically oriented, programmer-driven, massive growth.<p>37signals fits to some extent as well - bootstrapped by consulting, but product oriented, technically oriented, programmer driven, substantial growth. <p>Neither companies seem to want a sale or IPO - they're happy to settle into a role as profitable businesses.  At that point, I suppose they are no longer startups.<p>While these companies are the exception, the approach they advocate does seem to be growing.  So maybe you call them startups and say that there are many paths - and the IPO/sale exit is more typical.  ",1185832674

37778,comment,37733,37733,0,0,simpleenigma,,,"I've been trying different things on the Internet since about 1995. Back then I was trying to create online storage, which turned out to host more adult files then anything else. Finally gave that one up due to bandwidth costs.<p>After that I tried my hand at web-based email which extended into a calendar, time and billing and eventually forums that I hosted and other people could use their own domain name with. Turned into a semi-successful business, but the management of the system ended up eating up too much of my time and it wasn't making enough to let me quit my day job.<p>I wrote an anti-spam service that was efficient and quite good at filtering spam, but the resource required to take it to the next level were not around and I couldn't generate interest in the product. This came down to a not enough hardware to get the full working prototype finished problem.<p>Some of the largest problem I had were the 800 pound gorillas that seemed to appear just before my product was ready and I wasn't agile enough at the time to compete.<p>I don't regret implementing any of the project I did, even the map server that I've tried to create about 6 times. For me half the fun is the creation and until recently I haven't been dedicated to creating a large business out of it.<p>Plus the experience and the amazing tools that have come out of the whole journey are worth more then the the time I spent on all of this.<p>Another big lesson I've learned it that I can't do the whole thing alone. Just like you need the right tool for the right job, the right person for each job is important as well.",1185830278

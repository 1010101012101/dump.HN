10944643,comment,10944183,10944337,0,0,gutnor,,,"It is not surprising for the reason you cite, but it is still interesting to see it actually measured.<p>Android dominate iOS by a huge margin, and I think it is ahead even in the high end segment. You can understand that people going for high end will spend more money on apps, but still price of apps is basically the same between iOS and Android, and iOS is not lacking in diversity including free software. So it is quite surprising that even a few buys from the middle and entry level consumers cannot offset Apple advantage.<p>And I write advantage, but I&#x27;m not even sure what it is exactly. iOS users spend more because they like Apple stuff was a nice narrative when Apple was a edgy high end alternative to mainstream. But in the smartphone world, Apple is mainstream, and yet the same behaviour is observed even with a much wider consumer base.<p>Is that because Apple brand is so strong that buying Apple change the consumer behaviour. (I have noticed that paying for stuff when you have Apple hardware is socially more acceptable. Like I bought BetterZip and my colleague didn&#x27;t blink, but I paid for the Winrar license on windows and that was considered like sacrilegious. Like buying software for linux was considered weird but not on windows) Or is it because the Apple environment is just a tiny bit better that it makes a difference at the time of splashing 2 GBP on a game ?<p>Another alternative is that it is just that the app market is catching up more slowly than the hardware market, and it is just a question of time before sanity prevail. At least for the time being, my monkey brain is happy to have the social validation to have bought the &quot;right brand of smartphone&quot; :-)",1453377550

10944611,comment,10942294,10944387,0,0,notalaser,,,"Trouble is, that part is not only evil in terms of moral -- it&#x27;s detrimental to software quality.<p>A lot of people seem to think that portability is just a way of being nice to people who use obsolete devices. Nothing could be further from the truth. First, the simple act of isolating platform-dependent (whether &quot;platform&quot; means software or hardware) operations behind an uniform interface makes software more future-proof, makes the code better organized, and forces you to think about the problem until it&#x27;s clearer in your own head.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of software that was not meant to be portable, &#x27;cause hey, we&#x27;re only going to use it on <this CPU> running <this OS> and doing <these things>. Ten years down the line, no one is buying machines with <that cpu>, <that OS> hasn&#x27;t been supported in half a decade and you have ten new customers that want different things, so <these things> are now <these 1000 things that we never thought about>. The software is now full of various small hacks and quirks and a compatibility layer has been bolted on top of a hundred thousand lines of code that make fifty small assumptions about the underlying platform.<p>As for conspiracies... I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an evil masterplan behind anything, but I&#x27;m hesitant to be happy about a big company playing an important role in a critical piece of unportable infrastructure. A lot of people jump on the &quot;it works and I don&#x27;t care about other platforms&quot; bandwagon. Suuure, they&#x27;ll say, systemd is Linux-specific, but there are good reasons for that, they use Linux-specific things so that they can be as well-integrated as possible and give the most flexibility to their users.<p>Win-win, right? Linux users win a better platform, systemd developers don&#x27;t need to be worried about platforms their users don&#x27;t care about.<p>Except &quot;systemd developers&quot; is Red Hat, a bunch of really young people who hope to work for Red Hat one day, and a community of people who have been writing SysV scripts for so long that they&#x27;ll give a kidney for anything that will put a nail in that crap&#x27;s coffin. It&#x27;s basically Red Hat and a few people that the PR machine calls &quot;community&quot;, but make no mistake about it, when the people who do it for fun go have fun somewhere else, Red Hat is still going to be the main engine behind it.<p>&quot;Platforms their users don&#x27;t care about&quot; is -- by no mere coincidence -- Red Hat&#x27;s competition. In this context, lack of portability is just a glorious term for vendor lock-in. Your infrastructure depends on systemd? Great, I hope you like Linux, &#x27;cause you won&#x27;t be moving it to something else any time soon.<p>Oh, but the options are open, you&#x27;ll move to CentOS, you say? Right -- for now, that&#x27;s an option, because the Linux enterprise market is still, by and large, up for grabs, and there are very few Linux companies that are large enough that Fortune 500-class companies can talk to. If Red Hat goes evil <i>now</i>, they&#x27;ll just go out of business. Wait for ten more years, until it supports enough projects that are too vital to fail, before you tie yourself to their platform.<p>Remember all the fun we had with SMB and Kerberos a long, long time ago? Just because they have fluffy penguins doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t go Microsoft on our asses.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t care about software quality (which is a bad idea but I&#x27;ve seen enough people who think that &quot;it&#x27;s good&quot; means &quot;it makes money for the people selling it&quot;), portability is great, it&#x27;s a free ticket to say you know what guys, fuck you, fuck your shit platform, fuck your shit licensing schemes and <i>especially</i> fuck every single one of you fuckers, I&#x27;m switching to <this>.

I wish the team would focus and just make it great.<p>Many people would complain about SQL and what not but the truth is there&#x27;s a very large number of people who are quite happy with MongoDB and the fast experience building an app.<p>However there are some really big issues that seem to be ignored:<p>1) It&#x27;s nice that its backwards compatible but some essential features are missing such as a router. Iron Router is available but it&#x27;s practically abandoned. You can&#x27;t even have URL&#x27;s such as /2 on it.<p>It makes it hard to keep an app for the long run knowing there is a risk of an essential component about to be abandoned.<p>Other similar projects include Meteoric (an Ionic wrapper)<p>2) I wish they&#x27;d focus on making Blaze work. It works. Many people don&#x27;t like react and just want an App build on V1 to work with V1.5 and V2. The lack of clarity is harmful to the use of Meteor in The Enterprise.<p>3) The build time. It used to be that Meteor built a project near instantly when a file was changed and hot code changed the page. Now it takes a good 20 or so seconds for a simple line change. It seems over the top.<p>4) Clarity and focus on direction. They spent ages pushing people to their Npm system, now they&#x27;re going back. Why not start with node_modules/complete npm support instead of flipping back and forth. The volatile state of affairs with Blaze, Npm and the general structure of an app manifests risk in choosing Meteor for an actual Enteprise grade app.<p>5) A focus on improving what already works well over adding new features and degrading the performance of existing features.<p>I mentioned the build time, but other parts of Meteor such as Cordova, Blaze, Tracker, Mongo (Meteor uses MongoDb 2.6?!) would certainly help more.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s happened but it seems a lot like the team is losing focus of what people actually like about the project.",1453375485

It&#x27;s quite magical.<p>For someone like me (I&#x27;m more of a designer who can code than the opposite), the reactivity, feedback and interaction with your code make the whole process feel much more &quot;hands on&quot;, almost like sculpture, in the sense that you are able to poke things and see them react instantly. And that makes all the difference.<p>Yes, many problems do appear once you dive deeper, but I&#x27;ve never used another tool that brought me closer to my ideas than Meteor.

They are amazing not because they add some &quot;fancy&quot; features but because they train you to think with a different, much cleaner and simpler, mindset. Before your brain &quot;clicks&quot; you feel miserable. After it does you think &quot;why on earth isn&#x27;t everybody using this??&quot; and any problem is solvable by dispatching actions and building reducers (thank you Redux!).<p>Three days ago I spent a couple of hours on Meteor&#x27;s simple-todos tutorial, trying to understand how everything was working (that is, at an abstract level). I felt great after finishing it. Two days ago I started building a service we&#x27;d like to launch within a couple of months, e-commerce like stuff. I felt miserable. Pushed the first &quot;draft&quot; with a customized sign up and I felt like I had no idea how to proceed.<p>Yesterday I spent 4 more hours, started using packages like autoform, collection2, something for bootstrap, iron-router etc. and I feel FREAKING GREAT. Again my brain clicked and now I implemented ~70% of the features with validation, defensive checks on the server for security, nice-looking popups, good overall UI... I mean, I intended it to be a prototype, maybe mocking some parts but, damn, we basically already have a MVP! In 3 days (effectively ~12 hours)! And now I already know how to implement the rest, it just feels <i>natural</i> now. Like when you have a solid plan and you think it through in your head and you KNOW how to implement each and every step of it.<p>You can hit a wall with Meteor as much as you can with any other framework (I mostly use Django).

Contractually, or legally for example?<p>A bit like the idea of crowd funded projects could accept money but not delivering anything were looked at negatively in terms of legal contracts and people paying for things and services.<p>In my case, my hobby website of a few tens of thousands of users could benefit from some extra development time (backups, caching etc) and I was thinking of Patreon rather than a paid service to reward the donors with these new features. Would Patreon be a better fit for &quot;support this and as a side effect get somewhat improved access to new features&quot; rather than &quot;I will give you X in return for your money&quot;.  Seems like a Patreon donor may consider their donation as a service they have paid for, rather than a gift.",1453374340

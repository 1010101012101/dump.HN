If someone wanted to buy REI&#x27;s business, who would they buy it from? A retailer like Target has $70B annual revenue and a market cap of $40B.

If it doesn&#x27;t violate civil rights, it&#x27;s 100% fine to me. What&#x27;s the alternative? Should an employer NOT be allowed to fire someone they don&#x27;t like? That sounds like very bad constraints on the employer. Should there be some protection system against specific reasons for terminating employees? It&#x27;s not possible from a legal perspective, because you&#x27;d have to implement a law to protect every possible reason an employer would want to fire someone, all of which would trample the rights of the employer. Any employer is as free to fire someone for hate speech as the person is for supplying hate speech. It doesn&#x27;t mean that either are free of consequences.<p>The employer controls the company. If keeping someone on board who has opposing views will lead to a worse company and more suffering, it would make moral sense to fire them.",1453759131

For example, say you have someone with 15 years of experience in system architecture and they have a Master&#x27;s degree, and are bilingual, etc. Instead, you apply for a generic software engineer LCA, with a bachelor&#x27;s degree with 3-5 years of experience. Now isntead of the LCA being approved for $150,000 it&#x27;s down to $80,000. The immigrant doesn&#x27;t complain because they&#x27;re still getting a raise and have a chance to get a Green card. Meanwhile the company is getting to severely underpay (profit!) the worker.<p>There are all kinds of ways to game the LCA system. Apply for a location in Indiana, then bring the workers to Chicago. Apply for Arizona then bring them to LA. All the tech companies are abusing the system to their own advantage. USCIS is poorly funded and hardly checks on this, if ever.",1453759025

Additionally a Python script would have to load/init the models on every call from Parallel. I agree that this is not a great demonstration of Spark main strengths.",1453756952

For them, a story was fiction (not true to life) if it taught lessons and ideas that were not true. A story was non-fiction (true to life) if it taught lessons and ideas that were true. So a simple story like &quot;a citizen robbed a merchant and was rewarded by the town for his good deed&quot; may or may not be factual (by our standards), but to them would be a fiction. On the other hand, the story of Icarus would be regarded as non-fiction, not because it actually happened in the sense that we understand historical events, but because it taught a moral truth. Whatever did or did not happen in the mundane world of day-to-day life wasn&#x27;t as important as the lens through which that world was interpreted.<p>With that in mind, they would not have placed a high priority on clearly stating what was totally real and what was totally unreal. Atlantis could have been a real city in accordance with the theory described by OP, but Plato might have adopted that truth for the purpose of crafting a political allegory that would be, in his eyes, even MORE true than some mundane fact like &quot;Atlantis actually exists.&quot; So don&#x27;t be too quick to dismiss it as false just because Plato meant it as a political allegory.

After winning the right to vote in 1965, King greatly redefined his scope of action targeting economic justice for the poor in general, regardless of skin color.<p>>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about &quot;Where do we go from here?&quot; that we must honestly face the fact that the movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society. (Yes) There are forty million poor people here, and one day we must ask the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising a question about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. (Yes) And I&#x27;m simply saying that more and more, we&#x27;ve got to begin to ask questions about the whole society. We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life&#x27;s marketplace. (Yes) But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. (All right) It means that questions must be raised. And you see, my friends, when you deal with this you begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the oil?&quot; (Yes) You begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the iron ore?&quot; (Yes) You begin to ask the question, &quot;Why is it that people have to pay water bills in a world that&#x27;s two-thirds water?&quot; (All right) These are words that must be said. (All right)<p>>Now, don&#x27;t think you have me in a bind today. I&#x27;m not talking about communism. What I&#x27;m talking about is far beyond communism. (Yeah) My inspiration didn&#x27;t come from Karl Marx (Speak); my inspiration didn&#x27;t come from Engels; my inspiration didn&#x27;t come from Trotsky; my inspiration didn&#x27;t come from Lenin. Yes, I read Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital a long time ago (Well), and I saw that maybe Marx didn&#x27;t follow Hegel enough. (All right) He took his dialectics, but he left out his idealism and his spiritualism. And he went over to a German philosopher by the name of Feuerbach, and took his materialism and made it into a system that he called &quot;dialectical materialism.&quot; (Speak) I have to reject that.<p>>What I&#x27;m saying to you this morning is communism forgets that life is individual. (Yes) Capitalism forgets that life is social. (Yes, Go ahead) And the kingdom of brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of capitalism, but in a higher synthesis. (Speak) [applause] It is found in a higher synthesis (Come on) that combines the truths of both. (Yes) Now, when I say questioning the whole society, it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation, and the problem of war are all tied together. (All right) These are the triple evils that are interrelated.<p>-Where do we go from here?

The summary would have us believe that HFT is a trick employed by giant Wall Street banks to screw over smaller players. But Katsuyama, the protagonist of Lewis&#x27; book, was a big-bank trader, paid exorbitant amounts of money to tax large block orders by pension and hedge funds, and outraged by his inability to compete with algorithms that were bidding that tax down.<p>I&#x27;m uncomfortable calling any giant financial firm &quot;trustworthy&quot;, but if you were going to pick one firm that has come close to earning that label, it&#x27;s Vanguard. Vanguard&#x27;s chief investment officer has repeatedly and unequivocally stated that HFT firms have lowered Vanguard&#x27;s costs and improve outcomes for its investors.<p>Here&#x27;s Matt Levine writing entertainingly about how the &quot;Flash Boys&quot; in Lewis&#x27; book ought to have been, based on his previous books, the protagonists, and Katsuyama the villain:<p><a href=""http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-03-31/michael-lewis-doesn-t-like-high-frequency-traders"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-03-31/michael-lew...</a>",1453755741

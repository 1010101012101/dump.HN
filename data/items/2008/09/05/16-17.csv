It's that we spend so much time bikeshedding, sketching and resketching UI ideas in meetings, trying to impress each other with our ability to divine what is going on in the head of an imaginary customer. All the while avoiding the task of observing any actual customers!",1220630974

When there is a storm bearing down it's the most important thing in the world to potentially millions of people.

In a perfect world there would be a budget to hire proper specialists, but for me, right now, I'm an army of one. And a cash poor army of one at that! So at this stage I've gotta do everything myself. It's tough not knowing how to write code- I'm actually quite interested in learning but I don't have the time, and I will never be any good compared to you guys. I'm building a prototype/demo so I can convey my idea properly in order to get funded, I anticipate doing most of the design myself at this early stage, and I'm assuming it will all have to be redone later for the reasons you already mentioned. Thanks so much for your input, I agree with you completely.",1220630603

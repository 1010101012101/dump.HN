Specifically, as automation decreases the need for human labor, then profits go up and employment goes down. This has actually been the trend since the 1970&#x27;s.

It&#x27;s time we made some real big-news progress against this horrible collection of ailments we call cancer.<p>For those who don&#x27;t want to read through the lengthy human interest story wrapping the news here, from a quick read I gathered they&#x27;re basically modifying T-Cells:<p>> <i>In their natural state, T cells usually arent able to kill tumor cells, partly because they cant latch on strongly enough. But June was fascinated by scientific papers showing it was possible to change this. A few researchersfirst an Israeli named Zelig Eshhar in the 80s, then other investigators around the worldhad discovered that you could force a T cell to stick to a tumor cell and kill it. To pull this off, you built an engineered T cella T cell never before seen in nature. You altered the T cells genetic blueprint by injecting a new gene into the cell. The new gene would tell it to build a new molecular limb. The limb, called a chimeric antigen receptor, would sit partly inside the cell and partly outside, and it could send signals either in or out. One signal it could send was: kill. Another was: replicate.</i><p>> <i>June loved this approach. So elegant. Put the immune system on steroids. What if you could train the body to fight cancer on its own? What if, instead of replacing a patients immune system (as in a bone-marrow transplant) or pumping him full of poison (chemo), you could just borrow some cells, tweak them, and infuse them back into the patient? In theory, the engineered cells would stay alive in the blood, replenishing themselves, killing any tumors that recurred. It occurred to June that one infusion could last a lifetime.</i><p>It seems this research has been going on for 10+ years. How many people have died because of the glacial regulatory pace of cancer research?",1376810840

You can find affordable real estate (especially with your budget of $2k) within Westchester.<p>A lot of people travel from New Jersey to Manhattan within a a half hour - this is a pretty good commute. But you can still live within New York if you live in one of the lower towns of Westchester and travel using Metro North. It&#x27;s a higher end train system than the subway, and it goes to Grand Central station from just about every conceivable town that would be a commutable option for you.<p>New York and New Jersey are fundamentally different. Yes, both can work for you, but one will fit your personality more than another. The outer boroughs and the lower towns of Westchester have a distinct &quot;NY&quot; feel that is still very urban and metropolitan (despite having a lot of suburbs) because it is so close to the city and within the same state.

Mechanisms are cool to watch, but they often have to be aligned when initially set up, they wear in complex ways, may have to be taken apart to be lubricated and can be very difficult to fabricate.

I&#x27;ve even started seeing junkies back near Tompkins Square Park again.  South Street Seaport was still a popular place to find a hooker at night until 9/11.<p>14th Street, in days past, was a famous dividing line for residents of the city, with many proudly claiming that they either didn&#x27;t go below it or didn&#x27;t go above it.

Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t happen... at least in any of my friends&#x27; businesses.  You&#x27;ll get people looking for a deal, looking to spend as little as possible, and not interested in coming back unless you give them the same or better deal again.  Additionally, the customers are much more demanding than regular clientele, as can be common with deal-hunters.

I can&#x27;t tell who is a meth addict and who is not. I am sure much of my charity goes to alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, meth, and other drugs. I just consider that a cost of doing business. For every dollar I give out, some subset of that money goes to __non-drug use__. I think that is a good use of my capital.<p>(2) &quot;Due to their lack of will power to &#x27;succeed&#x27; rather than lack of opportunity.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s a couple of things to say to this sentiment.<p>First, I often hear the notion that impoverished people have the opportunity to bring themselves out of poverty. That&#x27;s not true. The world&#x27;s economic system results in non-zero unemployment. Meaning there are more people who want jobs than there are available jobs. Thus there are inevitably many people who want to work but can&#x27;t get it. The only way they can survive is through charity --- from either friends, family, strangers, the government, charities, etc.<p>The last point I&#x27;ll make might be the most controversial, but it is also at the core of why I give money directly to impoverished people.<p>I am skeptical that &quot;will power&quot; exists in the literal sense. As in, I am skeptical that free will exists as much as people tend to intuitively believe. It seems to me that humans are just moist robot automatons whose actions are the result of their current physiological state and response to the stimuli on their senses. Some interesting scientific research has shown that humans can perceive more free will than they actually have. There is also some interesting philosophical arguments that suggest free will could be a complete illusion. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will</a><p>So I think it&#x27;s possible that people who &quot;lack of will power to &quot;succeed&quot;&#x27; are simply __unlucky__. And I happen to be lucky. I am smart, tenacious, hard-working, have relevant job skills and I happen to live in a society where those variables are rewarded with wealth.<p>It therefore makes sense to me to give people small amounts of money when they ask for it. It just might be the case that I am lucky and they are not.<p>I do not expect this money to solve any of their problems. But maybe the person I help will buy a tasty snack and their happiness will go up in those moments. Or maybe that person will buy a cheap ukulele and teach himself to play --- which happened the other day with someone I regularly give money to.",1376809398

Probably best to get all of the details firsthand from your potential team than to guess.<p>Now in terms of Asian/Asian-American culture in NYC, it is generally split into three groups; a) the old-timers and descendants living in Flushing and Chinatown, b) the professional&#x27;s who moved into NYC to work for the banks, c) the professional&#x27;s who moved into NYC to work at Silicon Alley/Media/Publishing etc.<p>Group a) are the people with the most Chinese culture; every weekend, extended families go have dim-sum outings at the Flushing mall with multiple round tables of family relatives. However, Flushing is a mixture of Chinese people who came to the city during the 70&#x27;s and a new wave of immigrants in the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s. So you have a eclectic mix of Chinese people who work in restaurants, aren&#x27;t as educated and also the sons and daughters of kids who were brought up in the old-timers old school Chinese household who worked their way up through the restaurant chains and became owners and sent their kids to good colleges. The old timers&#x27; culture and attitude closely resembles Hong Kong and Taiwan.<p>Group b) are the INTJ and class-A personalities. There&#x27;s a good mixture of both ABCs (American Born Chinese) and FOBs (first generation) in this crowd. A lot of my friends in this group are very ambitious and try to climb the management ladder by either obtaining a prestigious business degree (e.g., going to Wharton) or by working very long hours or by working on guangxi. As a result, socializing is very superficial. Some of the people I kept in touch since college or hang out with on weekends, I find that I hardly really know them at all; they best represent the &#x27;jing&#x27; of Chinese people as in Shanghai and the Mainlander attitude of always being calculating for self-preservation.<p>Group c) are generally the more Americanized Chinese people as they work in non-traditional fields. Although the degree varies depending on where they grew up and their upbringing. You might find some Asian Americans are willing to hang out with both Americans and Asians; some will only hang out with Asian Americans but no international Asians; some will not hang out with any Asians at all. The best way to describe this is the attitude of certain Hong Kongers toward Mainlander immigrants in Hong Kong, some will accept them, some think that they are superior because of their Euro-centric upbringing despite the fact that we all are Chinese.<p>But in general, everyone is very nice in NYC as it is an very international city. However, you&#x27;ll have to make an effort to make new friends as it is a big city where everyone hurries from one subway station to the next. But the friends you make once you do make a real friend, you can generally count on the person.<p>I hope this helps and this is only my opinion, best of luck to your transition,",1376809377

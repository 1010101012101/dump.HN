It&#x27;s encouraging to see that Science published a paper based pretty much only on sequencing data.<p>The next step is to find out the mechanism of how mRNA gets transferred from parasite to host. How does the mRNA exist stably in the inter-cellular space? Are there specialized transport proteins? How does it get through the cell membrane? Are the mRNA actually getting actively translated? Is codon usage between host and parasite similar?",1408280345
8189291,comment,8188444,8188444,1,0,lnanek2,,,"> All youngsters need to believe that they have a stake in \n> the future, a goal worth striving for, if they’re going to\n> make it in school. They need a champion, someone who\n> believes in them, and that’s where teachers enter the \n> picture.<p>The author then goes on to throw out all attempts to measure and improve education and say it needs a personal touch everywhere. When I was a student I hated all my teachers because I just read the books, aced all the tests, and ignored the the homework. I skipped class as much as I could without violating official graduation policy and read books under a tree or at a rest stop. Teachers just got in the way. Any personal touch by the teachers would have just slowed me down more than they already were and made me hate them more.<p>Let&#x27;s stop with this touchy feely nonsense and measure and improve. If you go out and run every day you may feel good about yourself, but you&#x27;ll never turn in good times unless you measure your time and work on improving it each time. You&#x27;ll do even better if you compete with teammates and rivals during practices and meets. I think this article is what happens when you let an English major or similar comment on process, something they really didn&#x27;t need to get their near worthless degree.",1408280251

8189286,comment,8185021,8188904,5,0,leoc,,,"I don&#x27;t think the Nazis felt as secure from internal challenge in Germany during their rule as they appear to have been in retrospect. In any case, whether it was really unnecessary or not, they seem (from the little I&#x27;ve read about this) to have been past masters at controlling potential domestic opposition using the rapier rather than the bludgeon, using a combination of bribery and conciliation, isolation and media control, divide-and-conquer, obfuscation and legal hoop-jumping, and judicious applications of extreme violence. Instead of flattening German &quot;civil society&quot; outright, they won the tug of war with it, dragging it along with them instead of having it pull them back. There was in fact open (though of course not, in the end of the day, <i>effective</i>) opposition to T4 from inside Germany, notably from the Catholic Church which was one institution the Nazis had to handle with some care, and Cardinal van Galen was invoking the German Penal Code against it as late as 1941. So legal changes were probably all part of the minuet.<p>I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s inevitable that the T4 perpetrators would have been punished if the Nazis had lost power at some point in, say, early 1941. The western world had been increasingly heading in that direction before the war, and to a large and increasing extent it&#x27;s arriving back there now, as evidenced by, for example, the mysterious absence of Down&#x27;s Syndrome children in many places these days. Come to think of it, many of the people implicated in T4 didn&#x27;t in fact end up facing justice after the war either.",1408279985

If you think &quot;Nazism sent people to concentration camps&quot; is not a valid thing to say, then replace &quot;Nazism&quot; with &quot;Jainism [0]&quot; or &quot;postmodernism&quot;.<p>Nazism entails the belief that a group of humans is inferior to other humans and that they can be destroyed. The arrow &quot;someone is Nazi&quot; -> &quot;someone sends people to concentration camps&quot; follows from their <i>ideology</i>.

8189256,comment,8185021,8189189,4,0,breadbutt,,,"> One of the most fervent supporters of the Davy Crockett was West Germany&#x27;s defense minister Franz Josef Strauss, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Strauss promoted the idea of equipping German brigades with the weapon to be supplied by the US, arguing that this would allow German troops to become a much more effective factor in NATO&#x27;s defense of Germany against a potential Soviet invasion. He argued that a single Davy Crocket could replace 40–50 salvos of a whole divisional artillery park — allowing the funds and troops normally needed for this artillery to be invested into further troops, or not having to be spent at all. US NATO commanders strongly opposed Strauss&#x27;s ideas, as they would have made the use of tactical nuclear weapons almost mandatory in case of war, further reducing the ability of NATO to defend itself without resorting to atomic weapons.[7]<p>It seems that even at that time, the US wanted to keep the conflict nuclear-free as much as possible.",1408278685

But by claiming you are fixing &quot;Unicode&quot; in general as the first thing on the GitHub page, you might be misleading first-time visitors. Maybe you should try to place the &quot;warning&quot; about the encodings your library does handle right at the start somewhere? And make it clear that &quot;moji-un-baking&quot; is the library&#x27;s central and main use-case, not just an &quot;interesting thing&quot; it can do.

Given you are a text mining company, you of all guys should know you loose valuable information - particularly about numbers, super- and subscript characters - with this normalization strategy. Doing NFKC on stuff like all kinds of articles, books, patents, etc. would lead to potentially disastrous results (e.g., NFKC &quot;decomposes&quot; the string &#x27;O\\u2082\\u00B9&#x27; to &#x27;O21&#x27; instead of &#x27;O_2^1&#x27; - &quot;oxygen, reference 1&quot;). In general, I think NFC is what Python and many other libraries do, while I believe NFKC should only be used when you know what you are doing (and why you need it).

While English was the default language of this group, in conversations between any two people the participants would often switch to the native language of one or the other. For example, a young man from France would greet another in English, but upon discovering that his conversation partner is from Italy, would switch to Italian. This would not find approval among Esperantists. Ironically, English proves the neutral choice here. It is often seen as a sure bet for international communication among young people in many countries, but it is well understood that other languages may serve just as well. In the Esperanto movement, on the other hand, there is an ideological attachment to Esperanto which mandates its use even if there are other, more culturally rich possibilities. &quot;&quot;&quot;<p>My experience was at large international demo-parties. I mainly noticed this for English and German, but that&#x27;s because I speak those two languages relatively fluently (Dutch is my mother tongue). The same must have been happening around me for French or Spanish (or who knows what else) as well, but I don&#x27;t speak those languages well enough to tell for sure whether they were using (say) Spanish as a common bridging language or were native speakers.<p>And yes, English is usually the sure bet. Although some of the comments elsewhere ITT have piqued my interest to perhaps learn some Spanish in the future, especially if it&#x27;s really that easy to learn. Funny, I used to hate learning language (French and German) in high school. It&#x27;s only later in my life that I found out I actually have quite a knack for it :) (I should probably blame the way it was taught, but I can&#x27;t really get that much worked up about it, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the quality of my education overall)",1408277397

My last remark was targeted at anyone reading the comment, I didn&#x27;t mean to sound condescending towards you.<p>I don&#x27;t share your belief that early libraries and frameworks have the potential to override Elixir&#x27;s broad domain. In other words, even if there will be a widely popular library/framework for Elixir, it won&#x27;t automatically negate its other strength or fitness for a wide range of uses.<p>During the recently held ElixirConf we&#x27;ve seen it used in a telecom company, also powering game servers, distributed robots, and hobby projects like an elevator controller and command-line applications. The community already has a diverse set of interests and many of us will be pushing the adoption in our respective areas of interest.<p>In any case, our best effort today would be to continue hacking and having fun with Elixir, and at the next year&#x27;s conference we&#x27;ll be able to see in which direction the trends go.",1408277337

I rarely use genius for the various annotations, but with the wealth of song (rap) lyrics, I often end up on the site. Being able to switch off annotations would be great.<p>[edit: Come to think of it, I&#x27;d love to see three modes: the current highlight, none, and footnotes (which one might hoover/click). Whenever I read annotated texts, I rarely care about <i>all</i> annotations -- I only look up the things I need to look up. And the highlights <i>are</i> really annoying when reading a text.]",1408277250

(Stalin wanted to split Europe in two.)<p>I remember that the Swedish communist party used to be staunch Stalinists until Moscow told them he was wrong.

They aren&#x27;t aware that they don&#x27;t actually own the tracks in their playlists until they try to play them on something else, or burn them to CD etc. This is an example of a paradigm shifting, with only half of the parties being aware of the shift. This is happening all the time, in all sorts of areas. The average (non IT industry) person has neither the time, nor inclination to keep up with these changes, they just want to listen to their music, look at their photos, read their email etc.<p>Yes, caveat emptor is still a legitimate rule, but the number of caveats per emptor is getting ridiculous, and no-one in power seems to think this a bad thing. It seems that it&#x27;s expected to assume that every provider (of goods or services) is megalomaniacally sociopathic, and if you get burnt by such behaviour, it&#x27;s your own fault.",1408276918

How does a kid know they want to learn math, except to see someone else able to solve a useful problem they had no idea could be solved?<p>In a thread on income inequality, someone posited that the best indicator for economic success was whether a person was read to as a child. They meant it as a holistic indicator over a number of factors, and I think one large one is that it meant the child early on had a role model for education.<p>I know for myself (anecdotal evidence, yeah yeah), I chafed very early on to learn to read, because my parents could and I couldn&#x27;t. Similarly, early on, while I could figure out some kinds of math (the basic of multiplication by seeing arrangements of windows, &quot;oh, three fours is twelve!&quot;, and then being given a toy that had the multiplication tables on opaque buttons that when pressed would show the answer, I recall other times when people were able to solve problems (long division, multiplication of 2 or more digit numbers) that I didn&#x27;t know how to solve, and I -desperately- wanted to. For a friend, who came from a rural family whose only owned book was a Bible, largely unread, it was when I introduced him to video games (RPGs), and fantasy novels, that he really began to read, and actually to purchase books himself.",1408276854

One of the most popular examples are the Klingons.<p>But what if Earth <i>is</i> that planet? Obviously it can support intelligent life, but while there&#x27;s lots of ways it could be harsher, there&#x27;s also lots of ways it could be friendlier. For instance, it would be nice if this ice age that we&#x27;re in the middle of wasn&#x27;t happening. (Incidentally, you can add that to your list of reasons why Earth can&#x27;t possibly support advanced life... it&#x27;s spent an awful lot of time nearly entirely frosted over lately. <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1225/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/1225/</a> )",1397829581

You really should only have to swing through on really tough ones.  (That isn&#x27;t to say you don&#x27;t need some strength -- picking up a heavy maul over your head is not easy.)<p>I split a lot of wood in high school, while working for a tree cutting company.  After half a day of splitting with a 15-lb head, steel handled maul you&#x27;d be unable to make a fist from the shock your hands took.  We used to have wood splitting competitions, in which you&#x27;d pick logs for your opponents.

For the rest, it&#x27;s best to be able to get productive to start saving early to establish a life where you can get ENOUGH out of life to not hit some anxious or depressive state later when you see doors closing to attaining EVERYTHING.<p>It&#x27;s efficient to be able to minimize suffering as you go versus rolling the dice that you will suddenly find a calling later.<p>Feast upon life to learn everything you can. Deconstruct suffering and you&#x27;ll find ways big and small to constantly create a life that you wouldn&#x27;t trade for some amorphous &quot;everything.&quot; The destination (goals) is usually only a milestone in the journey you are already engaged in. &quot;If you don&#x27;t stop to look around once in a while, you might miss it.&quot;",1397828882

I now really like what I do, and I&#x27;ve learned a bit about the nature of work. A few things come to mind:<p>0. The more competent you are at something, the more interesting it becomes. Expecting your first job to be interesting is setting yourself up for disappointment.<p>1. Autonomy, at least for me, is really important.<p>2. Nobody hires someone else to do the most interesting work available.<p>3. The best jobs aren&#x27;t advertised. Visibility, or self-promotion, is important to some degree.<p>The awesome thing about computing is the capital costs are so low you can short circuit a lot of the career progression.

Not Gen X, Y and Z.<p>Until the 1950s, young people in the west were expected to live with their parents until they married and settled down. Just crack open a Victorian novel. (A few HNers have noted that this is true in India, China and Japan; but it was also true in the west.)<p>This changed all at one and all of a sudden under the Baby Boomers. Young people left home earlier, travelled the world, experimented with drugs.  Let&#x27;s forget that the Baby Boomers were responsible for psychedelia, the protest movement and flower power.<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying: The Baby Boomers were a blip, premeditated by the astronomical rise of the USA in the global economy. Money and jobs were everywhere all of a sudden, endowing people (and especially young people) with the new freedom to experiment. Something that is not true now: We&#x27;re facing increased global competition from the East and the west&#x27;s manufacturing base has been hollowed out.<p>In terms of global and Western culture they were a non-stereotypical blip, the result of very particular and unusual economic and social conditions, a few flicks of the second hand on the our cultural watch.<p>So, are the Baby Boomers justified in criticising this generation for returning to former cultural values and habits?<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think so.

I have a wood-fired pizza oven in my backyard and use small, nicely split pieces of wood in order to retain some control over the fire.<p>Before buying the axe I used a four-sided wedge (basically an elongated pyramid) and a sledgehammer for splitting.<p>So, how does this axe perform? Overall, I am very happy with it and proudly show it off at every opportunity. After spending some time learning how to use it, I can report that, for some types and conditions of wood and with the right grip on the handle, it truly does split wood in the manner shown in the video.<p>As noted in the other comments, certain types of wood are easier to split than others. After my pizza oven was finished, I somewhat foolishly bought a 1/2 cord of apple wood from the apple-growing region of Washington state. This wood is incredibly dense and has proven difficult to split by any means, even after 3 years of seasoning. The splitting issue is made worse by the overall knottiness of the wood.<p>I also bought a 1/2 cord of mixed wood from a local supplier. The axe is at its best on straight, dry, knot-free pine, oak, cedar, and so forth. The vertical motion is translated into horizontal motion milliseconds after the blade of the axe penetrates the wood and the split-off portion flies to the side with explosive force, often landing 8 to 10 feet away.<p>It took me an hour or two to learn to use the axe properly, with a relaxed grip to allow the head to rotate after it strikes the wood. Wearing gloves (recommended in any case) can make this even easier.<p>The blade of the axe is not razor sharp and does not require sharpening or other maintenance.",1397827156

On top of that, there are many layers (OMX IL, stagefright, MediaCodec, OMX AL, Java Media) that interact together in a complex way and everyone messes in those layers in a different way...<p>For example, fora long time, even after mediacodec API was out (4.1), you could get the data back from the codec, but the frame format was not standardized and there were no tests in the Android validation! So every GPU was doing something differently.<p>On top of that, the hw decoders don&#x27;t even give the profile and level they support, so you have to guess them.<p>And even those days, there is no way to get a YUV 420 surface that works on most devices, even when using KitKat APIs.<p>And so many joyful things :)",1397826622

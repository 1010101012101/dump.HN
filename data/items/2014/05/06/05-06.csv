I use google voice and the GrooVe app to make and receive calls to and from land lines. They don&#x27;t need GVoice; <i>I</i> do. And I have it.<p>Then again, my GV calls connect to US numbers. On examination, the Google Voice rate to call mexico is indeed ridiculously high ($0.15 / minute -- compare the $7.14 / minute my parents&#x27; land line wanted in order to connect to China [GV rate: $0.02]).<p>But if the use case is talking to family members on a regular basis (seems likely when the cash cow is US -> mexico calls), it shouldn&#x27;t even be difficult to tell them &quot;if you use the internet, we can all talk for free&quot;.

If parking meters charged enough so that there were always at least one parking stall available on the street within two blocks of everywhere in the city, you&#x27;d never be able to charge for saving one.<p>The City actually installed the technology to set prices dynamically in a network with predictive systems so that prices can rise to keep those free spaces open.<p>But the city insists on charging so little at the meters that the very chance to pay such a low rate is worth $20.

7703006,comment,7695743,7698015,1,0,colin_mccabe,,,"I&#x27;m curious what your experience was with the LD_PRELOAD thing.  By &quot;problems with fork,&quot; you mean the possibility of forking without that environment variable set via exevpe or similar?<p><i>MooseFS targets exactly the same use case as GlusterFS.</i><p>Yeah, actually you are quite right.  I was getting MooseFS confused with a different filesystem.  MooseFS looks like it has a GFS heritage.  Kind of like what I am working on now... HDFS.<p><i>...and it&#x27;s probably not a coincidence that the file system component is the one piece of Ceph that still hasn&#x27;t reached production readiness.</i><p>Ceph&#x27;s filesystem component is reasonably stable.  It&#x27;s the multi-MDS use case which still had problems (at least a few years ago when I was working on the project.)  The challenge was coordinating multiple metadata servers to do dynamic subtree partitioning and other distributed algorithms.  Ceph has a FUSE client which you can use if you don&#x27;t want to install kernel modules, and a library API.<p>It seems that Lustre has an in-kernel server.  This might have led to some of the maintenance difficulties people seem to have with it.  (I never worked on Lustre myself.)  I don&#x27;t think this discredits the idea of in-kernel <i>clients</i>, which are different beasts entirely.  Especially when the client is in the mainline kernel, rather than an out-of-tree patch like with Lustre in the past.<p>It&#x27;s a tough market out there for clustered filesystems.  HPC is shrinking due to government sequesters and budget freezes.  The growth area seems to be Hadoop, but most users prefer to just run HDFS, since it has a proven track record and is integrated well into the rest of the project.  Moving into the object store world is one option, but that is also a very crowded space.  It will be interesting to see how things unfold.",1399354998

The city needs to charge more, in that block, at that time, so that spaces are made available and there is no need for cruising for parking. It would be interesting to see whereabouts in SF the app is offering parks for, probably not in the SFPark pilot areas.<p>Bottom line, it&#x27;s a market problem but the market is dysfunctional.

They can add another twist to it: Normally people know when they would be leaving. So they can advertise spot and time. Other users can then &quot;book&quot; the spot at the times being advertised.<p>If this becomes illegal then police can track down sellers using same app so things are flaky at that point. However I would doubt if selling information about available parking lots can be made illegal.<p>For those of you &quot;troubled&quot; by this, get this: Pretty much everything in life with short in supply is essentially an auction. When you reserve dinner at restaurant, they have adjusted their price such that their supply meets the demand. In Essence they sold the spots to highest bidders. This is not limited to private properties. When try to buy a house in the same area as great public school, same thing happens - you get priced out of the area and the goods goes to highest bidder.",1399353537

I read and write Arabic, so I use mlterm.  It is quite good, but unlike other emulators, it requires setup and learning configuration, but is very flexible.  I use Mutt to read for emails and mailing lists in Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu, and I rarely have problems.<p>In the Linux console, the situation is abysmal.  There was a project that works there, bicon from Arabeyes project, but does not understand SIGWINCH signals. This is problematic when I share a tmux session through the Linux console and X.org with my preferred WM, for example.  But to run small, mostly console programs with Arabic, bicon is old and can do some jobs for value of jobs.<p>A big problem is that Arabic input, and RTL input in general, is a problem where most devs in this space respond &quot;each application must address it in its own way.&quot;  This is why few console or GUI applications handle Arabic well.<p>FYI, Firefox was the only browser I could view Arabic language news in until like two or three years ago, on any computer for a while.

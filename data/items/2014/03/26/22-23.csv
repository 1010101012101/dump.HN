But the most valuable part of my PhD were the few years that I spent getting regular face time with subject matter experts, who walked me past the periphery of my field, to the point where I am comfortable enough publishing my own peer reviewed research.<p>You could read the literature and try to get far enough up to speed to publish entirely yourself, but I guarantee that you will miss many subtleties if you don&#x27;t connect with folks in the field. Enough that you are face a lot of hurdles trying to pass your work through peer review.

Python often lets you ignore these things but interviewers tend to be charmed by at least an attention to the possibility that your input is empty.<p>Also, it might be worthwhile to have some &quot;homework&quot; problems that don&#x27;t have solutions that are variations of the main problem.<p>For example, the stock price problem is sometimes presented as changes in price rather than absolute price.

Windows are usually dropped the height of a header.<p>For estimating many projects (painting, flooring, non-custom trim jobs), this app would be more than adequate.<p>When you get the job and go back to do the work, I&#x27;d suggest a Bosch LASER tape measure.

The only outcomes we can see is one report from a guy who says he saw a Huawei tech support account exfiltrating data that an American intelligence agency would like to have.

We could assume the NSA is the only organization with an interest in hacking Huawei because this is the only report we&#x27;ve heard about such a thing, but that&#x27;s speculating about unknowns.<p>There&#x27;s really nothing about this action that screams <i>NSA</i> specifically; it&#x27;s just being correlated with the story because the data appears to be useful for American intelligence. To say that there is no data that could be useful to both American intelligence and other parties would probably be a stretch. The only thing we do know for sure is that Huawei&#x27;s accounts were used to exfiltrate data; who wants the data, and what for, is a mystery. But what is certain is that you should be afraid of your Huawei support accounts.",1395874140

It was invented as a system for educating German professors in the 19th century, and it works well under those conditions. It’s good for a very small number of people who are going to spend their lives being professors. But it has become now a kind of union card that you have to have in order to have a job, whether it’s being a professor or other things, and it’s quite inappropriate for that. It forces people to waste years and years of their lives sort of pretending to do research for which they’re not at all well-suited. In the end, they have this piece of paper which says they’re qualified, but it really doesn’t mean anything. The Ph.D. takes far too long and discourages women from becoming scientists, which I consider a great tragedy. So I have opposed it all my life without any success at all.<p>I don&#x27;t think that I would have believed this until I got into graduate school but it&#x27;s really true.

Every person is different and you need to understand the personality of each one of your staff and it is not easy. The way you communicate with each person is a reflexion of your understanding of their personality and sometimes you get it wrong.<p>Suppose that you just realised that despite your best efforts, what you have been working on for the past year will not sell. Your board is maxing pressure on you and you decide to explore a new avenue. You now need to communicate the news to your employees, without making them panic, and to try to get them onboard to your new vision. Well I can tell you it&#x27;s hard, and it happens! It certainly happened to us more than I wished for. You are going to have to be a politician! You need to minimise the failure while painting a beautiful and bright future ahead, even though you don&#x27;t know yet whether it will work. This is probably what you refer to as &quot;Bullshit&quot;.<p>And then that&#x27;s just managing people. Managing a company is so much more than this. You make a ridiculous amount of decisions daily, and some of them will not please everybody. And some of them you will come back on.<p>Finally, remember that your boss is human too, and if he appears to be an arse at times, it is probably because he learned over time that being the best friend of his staff is a very bad idea. When a staff member is not performing, you are going to have to fix this. And pushing a staff member to improve is a lot easier done if that staff member thinks of you as his boss, and not his mate!",1395873985

Use redis and memcache to cache everything possible. Don&#x27;t even connect to the database unless you have to. Ensure that you can invalidate any cache entry easily and keep things atomic so you do not run in to race conditions. Use locking to ensure that when the cache expires the database does not get a dog-pile with multiple copies of the same query. You&#x27;d think the query-cache in your database of choice may be just as efficient but trust me, it is not even close. You can also cache higher-level objects than just simple queries.<p>Depending on your reliability requirements you may even consider treating your cache as writeback and doing batched database writes in the background. These are generally more efficient than individual writes due to a variety of factors.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on several top-2oo ranking sites and this has always been one of the main go-to strategies for scaling.

Those outside academia typically publish a bit less, mostly due to either having day jobs or pretty booked consulting careers (and in a few cases, due to secretive employers restricting what they can publish). But many are still actively involved in conferences like <a href=""http://www.aiide.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aiide.org</a>.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem mostly billed as &quot;escaping&quot; or &quot;rebelling&quot;, though. Just, some people find different careers more attractive. Some people would hate some of the bullshit involved in academia but find consulting attractive; other people would hate some of the bullshit involved in consulting but find an academic job attractive; and other people do something else entirely, like working at Electronic Arts. People end choosing a pretty wide range of different careers, all with tradeoffs. Some people choose more than one! If anything, kind of amusingly, the narrative is a bit more frequent in the other direction: people who had a senior job at a big game company and &quot;rebelled&quot; or &quot;escaped&quot; by quitting the six-figure job and going back to school for a PhD. For example, the AI lead on No One Lives Forever 2 and F.E.A.R. left the AAA game industry to get a PhD... and now is leaving academia again to go back into the game industry, but as an indie (<a href=""http://web.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/</a>).<p>I get the impression a lot of applied CS has those kinds of dynamics.

The Manjaro team as far as I know does not maintain any packages not specific to Manjaro. After using Manjaro on my laptop for the better part of a year and running into lots of stability issues over the last few months, I think that the criticism about &quot;aging packages like wine&quot; is valid. I could deal with significant breakage in Xfce for a while, but when my wireless card (supported in the kernel) was unable to reliably connect to a wireless network, I had to toss Manjaro for good. If there&#x27;s breakage in Arch, it will make it to Manjaro, and Arch packages seem to break more often these days.<p>I think that the state of Linux desktop right now is bad. GNOME3 is a pretty toy and KDE4 is ugly and (in my experience) unstable. Xfce is getting heavy, so it seems like people are all going to *box DEs. There used to be much greater diversity of well-supported desktop distros, like MEPIS, that weren&#x27;t just another layer over Ubuntu.<p>Fedora seems to be the only decent distro for development right now: Fast mirrors, systemd for reasonable boot times, up-to-date packages, no distractions or consumer focus (Ubuntu), well-supported and relatively stable.

It doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference with humans, though, because we are so adept at pattern-matching. So it seems like while a larger board would certainly make things more difficult to a human, they wouldn&#x27;t really have to make many adjustments in their fundamental strategy. On the other hand, it could dramatically weaken a computer player.<p>As to the other point raised, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any reason why it would suddenly cease to become Go if you increase the board past 19x19.

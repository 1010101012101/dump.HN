They'll simply be dropped off at a dealers lot near you.<p>It is also one of the cheapest ways to buy a new car.<p>In <i>America</i> you may not be able to buy a new car online, but the world is a lot larger.",1234605371

481001,comment,480992,480992,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Together with increased cloud elasticity we'll have to have a much more accurate billing scheme based on fractions of a second usage, the vendors of cloud services will have to address that as well as the actual performance issues.<p>At some point you'll see for instance web based applications that fire up a cloud hosted vm per user session, much like you see an httpd process fired handling a single request right now, there will be no 'database' per se for 'your' data, just your VM for that app on ice somewhere when not in use.<p>This cloud thing is only just beginning, and even though it is the worst abused buzzword of the moment I think in the long run it really is the future of computing for everything that is geared towards services.",1234604998
481000,comment,479352,480970,0,0,nopassrecover,,,"To be clear, this isn't directed specifically at the person who wrote the blog post but from my point of view to be valued in the startup you have to do more than tell everyone else what to do.  Passion and vision are great, but you should be able to use these to practical value.  Anyone can say ""let's make this really awesome video game where you can do anything"" but unless you are actualy coming up with some practical direction for the team your ""vision"" is useless.",1234604687

I've always wondered how people cope with the sheer size and format of these things. I hardly ever read a newspaper simply because the involved acrobatic puts me off. Especially on the breakfast table I much prefer a simple magazine or book that I can lay down or hold with one hand.<p>You ofcourse have a point with the spilling/dropping issue but I think a kindle could easily be made robust enough to survive a certain degree of abuse.",1234604161

480996,comment,480986,480986,0,0,cperciva,,,"There's a much simpler reason, which doesn't seem to be even mentioned in the article: You can't test-drive a car online.  If I'm going to spend $30k buying something which I'm going to use for the next 5-10 years, I want to try it out -- or try out a very similar model -- first.<p>Then again, maybe I'm just weird.  I think people who buy condominiums before construction starts are crazy, too.",1234603617

They're good for document fidelity viewing and printing but horrible for further processing and even for interactive tasks like copy and paste. We urgently need a PDF successor.",1234603542

480982,comment,480200,480839,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Personal opinion coming up ...<p>I find this attitude an incredible strength in the hacker community, but also occasionally a real weakness.  It leads to a complete dismissal of a source of information, and that, surely, can't be right - namely, the mindset and knowledge of the person making the statements. When making decisions you should use all the information available.<p>Yes, some information should be tagged as ""hearsay"" (you can't check the person's credentials) and some should be marked as ""suspicious,"" but simply throwing it out is wrong.<p>When you teach or train it is critical that you know people's background so you can pitch the explanations and demonstrations at the right level.  When you listen to someone, you should assess what level of confidence to place in what they say.<p>Work since Shannon has shown that the most efficient communication of information (as opposed to data) is achieved when the sender has an effective model of the receiver, <i>and the receiver has an effective model of the sender.</i><p>Certainly many advances in breaking ciphers are achieved by knowing more about the source.  Cryptographers know not to throw away information, even when it is suspect.<p>You can dismiss this, or go and research it.  Does it sound interesting?  Should you ignore it?  Modern information theory says you shouldn't.  You don't know my credentials, so you have to make that decision in a void.  If I told you my credentials, would your opinion remain completely unchanged?  Modern information theory says it shouldn't.<p>Yes, be skeptical, but use what information you have.<p>All of it.",1234602488

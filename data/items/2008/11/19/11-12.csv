If feasible legally - like not disrupting the copyrights on current video.<p>I particularly liked the portion where the ads on the stadium keep changing. Bill boards, static advertisements would take a whole new dimension. For folks watching the same game on TV - the TV channels can cut a deal to rotate ads over there.<p>I think one of the big display ad guys would acquire them.",1227093806

369375,comment,368476,369243,0,0,Tichy,,,"I don't see the point of the freerice game. Why don't they just donate the money directly? I suppose the rice is paid for with advertising, but all the ads seem to be from wellfare organizations, so they are paid with donations that otherwise could go into rice directly. The only time this would REALLY yield some rice would be if somebody playing the game would end up donating money to one of the sponsors.<p>Anyway, that is a bit off-topic. Yesterday I had a discussion with friends who were all very depressed about their prospects on the job market. Basically they saw it as a given that everybody would either be jobless or be forced to work 60 h weeks and take shit from their bosses. So apart from the entertainment (which I personally value, too), I think it is a worthy achievement to show that there can be an escape from living as a drone. (Too bad none of my friends were programmers or engineers, but that is another problem).<p>As for trading drink icons on facebook, I don't know. But maybe it would serve the networking and socialising of human beings, which in turn might yield other positive effects. Maybe Unicef could win some sponsors for rice by giving out free drinks to people on Facebook, for example.",1227093473

369371,comment,369337,369340,0,0,jwilliams,,,"> <i>- It is _very_ congested. There is too much text to be able to focus. More whitespace and less text will help.</i><p>Agreed - there is just too much information generally. I actually find the icons more distracting than the text.<p>The information on the left appears to be repeated in the subtitle for each entry. e.g. Points and visits. I'd get rid of all the icons and just have the simple data on the left.<p>You could also ditch some (many) of the icons. The clock next to the ""two weeks ago"" is redundant. Either make it a descriptive icon (e.g. indicating length of time) or text - having both feels like overkill... This is probably harsh, but right now the site feels like I'm looking at Wingdings in FontBook.<p>Think having top tags and top 10 side by side takes up too much horizontal realestate. I'd simply have the top 10 on top and the top tags below.<p>Probably a debatable point - But, I'd not bother with Google Ads on the front page - if you're going to have them, put them on the category pages.<p>The content of front page is going to have highly variable and as such the ads are probably going to be poorly targeted... At least with the category pages you'll have ads that are relevant and more likely to get clicks. It also declutters the front page, which is probably important as a first impression.",1227093273

8904749,comment,8901302,8903256,0,0,mikeash,,,"Contrarianism and conspiracy theories are about how you think, not about what conclusions you reach. Sometimes they reach the correct conclusions by coincidence, but that doesn&#x27;t make them good. Conspiracy theories aren&#x27;t validated by the existence of conspiracies, any more than astrology is validated by your horoscope coming true on any given day.<p>Conspiracy theories are about faulty reasoning. In particular, they involve highly inconsistent evaluation of evidence, and rely heavily on post-hoc rationalization.<p>You say that &quot;anything that counters the mainstream version of events is automatically to be dubbed conspiracy theory in the dismissive sense.&quot; That&#x27;s simply not true. What&#x27;s happening is that the only people who happen to be countering the mainstream version of events are doing so with conspiracy theories.<p>Show me some <i>good</i> arguments that counter the mainstream version of events and we can talk. Nobody has done so thus far.<p>When I talk about conspiracy theories, it&#x27;s not because people are saying the flu vaccine is ineffective. It&#x27;s because people are talking about crazy stuff like how vaccines have been pushed hard in the past decade because of a non-existent provision of the PATRIOT act.",1421513923

I prefer to give the candidates every advantage possible.<p>Yes, I agree that hiring is hard and imprecise. I generally try to ask questions on a variety of different topics, to make sure that I can find where their strengths are; if they are weak in one or two areas, that can generally be worked around, but if they come off weak in 3 or more of the areas, I generally feel that it would be too much of a risk and take too much time to bring them up to speed.<p>> I would help them to the extent of my abilities in a work situation, so I see no use in being unnecessarily difficult in an interview<p>Do you really consider this question unnecessarily difficult? I find that it&#x27;s one of the easiest, that someone without even programming knowledge but with a good technical background should be able to answer.<p>> I know many highly able programmers who wouldn&#x27;t know how to respond given so many options<p>If someone doesn&#x27;t know where to start, I give them a prompt; &quot;just focus on the networking level&quot;. If they start but miss something, I ask a follow up question to clarify that &quot;so how does it know what IP address to contact?&quot; When I ask a question like this, I&#x27;m not trying to be tricky, but trying to ask a question that should involve knowledge that just about every competent programmer should have, and see how well they can break it down, explain it, stop at the part where their knowledge runs out rather than making things up or guessing.<p>I&#x27;ve had people guess on this question, completely getting it wrong when I ask something like &quot;and so what is the difference between TCP and UDP&quot;, and I find that even worse than just saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know how that part works&quot;; if someone knows what they don&#x27;t know, they will know when to ask questions, but if they just make stuff up to try to make themselves sound more knowledgeable, I don&#x27;t know if I could ever trust their knowledge or judgement because it could be based on them just covering up a lack of knowledge about something.<p>> Everyone talking about it showing what you&#x27;re interested in is 100% wrong in my case. I am not interested in TCP, DNS, etc. I know the details because at some point I&#x27;ve needed to debug something at that level.<p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t ask this question to tell what someone&#x27;s interested in. I ask it to determine (a) if they have enough experience that they have done at least some looking into how the stack works enough to discuss it intelligently and (b) whether they are capable of breaking down and explaining a complex piece of technology with several interacting parts.<p>For the jobs I&#x27;m hiring for, understanding the basics of how the network works is pretty much a requirement. If someone doesn&#x27;t know how DNS and TCP work, asking them to debug a complex performance problem with a distributed filesystem communicating with dozens of clients over a 40 G backend network and 10 G frontend is probably going to be asking a bit much of them. Even for the more basic application development tasks, almost everything we do touches the network somehow.<p>And if someone does actually discuss the details of input getting from the keyboard into the kernel, and from there into the browser, and it handling the event, and so on, then that does provide me with information that they know that portion of the stack well; I don&#x27;t expect everyone to know everything, but I do want people who are interested enough to at least have some basic knowledge of how the fairly complex system that they use on a day to day basis works.<p>> > Yes.

If they start but miss something, I ask a follow up question to clarify that &quot;so how does it know what IP address to contact?&quot;<p>> There are much simpler ways to discover &#x27;basic competence&#x27;. Getting candidates to translate a basic algorithm to pseudo-code even.<p>Yes, you would not use this as a sole interview question. This should generally be used as one of several. My basic screen consists of: write up a basic algorithm in pseudocode, compare and contrast data structures and running times for a couple of basic tasks, the &quot;what happens when I enter google.com into my browser and press enter&quot; question, a question on designing a class hierarchy for modelling a particular problem, a question on debugging where I lead them through a problem I&#x27;ve actually had to debug and see what kinds of suggestions they make about things to look for and ways to figure out what&#x27;s going on, and then an actual coding problem where I expect them to provide real code to solve a simple problem.<p>I don&#x27;t expect everyone to be an expert on all of these. Some people haven&#x27;t ever taken a formal algorithms and data structures course, or it&#x27;s been 20 years since they did so, so they haven&#x27;t really thought about asymptotic running time in a long time. That&#x27;s OK, as long as they do well on the others. Or some people may not know much about networking, but are strong in the other areas; that&#x27;s fine too.<p>But if someone doesn&#x27;t know much about networking, or algorithms, can&#x27;t design an appropriate class hierarchy and interface, and can&#x27;t really offer very good suggestions for how they would debug a problem that we encounter variations of fairly often here, I wonder whether they really are going to be able to contribute effectively. Or if they can talk a lot about the data structures and networking, but then fail at actually writing pseudocode to solve a basic algorithmic problem (and I&#x27;m talking very basic, like you should be able to do this in a CS 101 class) or fail at actually producing working code for the simple coding problem, I feel like they may have some good domain knowledge but don&#x27;t actually have the skills necessary to actually contribute.",1421513545
8904728,comment,8904368,8904634,0,0,cynicalkane,,,"> We have to remember that for every bitcoin sold (at any price), someone on the other side of the transaction is still buying those bitcoins<p>An alternate explanation is that supply is holding out, demand is spooked, and existing trading activity has little relation to supply and demand. Economic liquidity is not equal to book liquidity and trading volume isn&#x27;t equal to the health of a market (especially when Bitcoin holders can generate fake volume at a very low cost). This is why buying assets headed south--called &quot;catching a falling knife&quot;--is a classic trap for amateur traders.<p>This is going to be especially true for Bitcoin because there&#x27;s no viable way to short it that I know of--no way to depress trading demand unless you&#x27;re unfortunate enough to own some already.

However, I wonder if perhaps you&#x27;re taking it too literally.

It was revealed that mass telephony programs were still in operation years after the Church Committee was promised they were stopped.<p>- In the <i>1980s</i> Reagan declared Executive Order 12333 which massively expanded the executive branch interpretation of what it deemed its capabilities were under the limitations imposed on it, again expanding bulk collection capabilities.<p>- In the <i>1990s</i> the Clinton Administration battled to backdoor all cryptography in the United States after strong cryptography was finally deemed to be allowed to US citizens, instead the administration requires compliance by service carriers through CALEA and a constellation of other laws to have to the ability to strip any encryption that they provide on behalf of a customer and in general solidified the Third Party Doctrine (IP laws also made it impossible to add encryption oneself). It was revealed that mass telephony programs were in operation.<p>- In the late <i>1990s</i> there continued to be leaks of abuses and overreach by intelligence and law enforcement on profile building and mass surveillance.<p>- Through the <i>2000s</i> the Bush Administration and in the <i>2010s</i> the Obama Administration pushed to expand tap-and-trace laws and the Third Party Doctrine into the digital domain. &#x27;Fusion Centers&#x27; are established across the US where they monitor the activities of groups considered to be national security threats (including The Tea Party, a third party trying to use the democratic system we have in place to gain the support of the people) and collect bulk local level information. Fusion Center databases are not at national scales, and as far as I can tell, are not considered national databases (though they will pass records as need be up the chain).

By using the micro-usb connectors on the dock to connect to the sensors someone could connect the sensors to something say a smartphone (with the module rope) or to a computer (using the micro-usb to usb-A) which risks damaging both the sensor and the device been connected to, or worse plugging either the sensors or the sensor side of the dock into a phone charger again with the use of a micro-usb to usb-A. as I&#x27;m sure you are aware people will try to connect things together in ways the designer never thought of as long as they can fit together.<p>Its fine if you have already thought of this and accounted for it by designing protection in or if the usb connectors are just been used while its in development, but if you intend for it to be used in places like schools this could be a major issue as it could quite easily damage equipment

If it did (e.g., if a major flaw were discovered in the technology to render it useless), then people wouldn&#x27;t still be trading bitcoin. We have to remember that for every bitcoin sold (at any price), someone on the other side of the transaction is still <i>buying</i> those bitcoins. If it were truly &quot;dead&quot; or indisputably flawed, trading would come to a halt because there would be no bids for something truly useless.<p>Instead, what we&#x27;re looking at with the recent price decline is simply a reflection of how people <i>feel</i> about bitcoin - and in this case, that opinion has everything to do with factors that are irrelevant to the technology (failed exchanges, criminal activity, etc). If bitcoin were a public company, of course those kinds of things would matter (it doesn&#x27;t matter if public opinion is wrong; it can still ruin your business), but since bitcoin&#x27;s usefulness and underlying value do <i>not</i> rely on public opinion, it remains unaffected at the core by any of these recent events.",1421512048

Volatility is obviously undesirable for anything that is intended to function as a reserve of value. This is why, for example, there is no discussion of oil being a reserve of value, or a currency. 
As for the example above, greater liquidity in the Bitcoin market will not automatically make it less volatile, or lower volatility enough.<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s volatility is structural (it goes well beyond the issues with the exchanges). Effective currencies have several
mechanisms designed to protect their value and minimize volatility: Bitcoin lacks them and hence it&#x27;s structurally fragile and volatile. So, Bitcoin cannot represent a reserve of value. 
Stable preservation of value is a key characteristic of a currency (this is one of the reasons inflation is monitored by central banks, for example), hence, if Bitcoin cannot work as a reserve of value, it cannot work as a currency.<p>Perhaps, other crypto currencies, in the future, may be structured with more robust mechanisms and work better.",1421512045

Gox was the only manipulator ever to have had a significant effect on the price?  Seems unlikely.<p>Maybe the true explanation is that there was all this pent-up unknown hype for bitcoin, which Karpeles&#x27; manipulation unleashed on the world like a crack that broke a dam, either to his joy at skyrocking the price or his shock and horror at skyrocking the price, and now everyone&#x27;s resetting back to pre-hype levels.<p>I still think bitcoin has value.  Even after being used and abused, and dragged through a meatgrinder that shred away every ounce of my bitcoin fanboyism.  There is true value there, and that is its ability to get money from you to me in seconds, and then my ability to sell those coins on an exchange for fiat that&#x27;s deposited into my bank account within just a couple days.  In that scenario, it doesn&#x27;t even matter what bitcoin&#x27;s current price is.  All that matters is that the exchange honors the agreement at the time the coins were sold, because the flow is that the coins go from you to me to being sold on an exchange/middleman within a few minutes.  So the current price of bitcoin is whatever it is, and I&#x27;m still paid however much I was expecting from you.<p>And it seems like a solid upward trajectory could even be built on that foundation.<p>But it&#x27;s going to take patience and time.",1421510777

Namely, do I haul or burn. I decided to sort and haul with extreme prejudice.<p>Before I took off on my hacker tourism trip I was living in a suburban McMansion. The house was large and empty; my roommate was a recent divorcé whose kids had all moved out. We were both meticulous recyclers, and I sort all organic waste out of the trash and into the earth (a brief aside: I put it all into the ground. Many in the gardening world say this is bad; i disagree because nitrogen.). The net effect was a full recycle bin (two wheel standing bin) once a week and a half full rubbish bin (same design) once a month.<p>I believe that the key to reducing landfills and capturing trapped/wasted raw materials is an at-home solution.

If being restricted to work in Germany after studying there is expected that should be made explicit. I have never heard something similar mentioned in any discussion on subsidised education, to me this is quite insidious.<p>> No, it&#x27;s the American firms deskilling American workers (by lobbying for and winning lower public American investment in education and training in order to get lower taxes).<p>> That&#x27;s my point: the Germans voted responsibly to invest in their countrymen and have their investment consumed by Americans who are staunchly refusing to produce what they need themselves.<p>If America can spend less on education and still end up with better skilled people (and better products) this still feels like a net win.

As trends change and technology changes, often times the person in the latter camp will struggle much more than the person in the former camp. Sure, the people in the latter camp are much more impressive in their little slice of the world but the person who has seen the proverbial world will often be able to adapt more quickly.<p>I&#x27;ve also found that the person with a breadth of knowledge which spans these sorts of concepts can often use that experience to form outside the box solutions (in a good way) to sticky problems.",1421510436

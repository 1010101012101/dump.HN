3134603,comment,3132752,3134442,1,0,mayanksinghal,,,"Both the points you are making, makes Google a bad marketing/strategy firm but not evil: the sentiment I was replying to. And this is being done after they have agreed to provide support for pseudonyms! It may not be their first priority - or may require significant changes in the way data is being handled to allow for security of the <i>real</i> identity. But the OP assumed that this is because of a conspiracy between the firm, ISPs and Government, and that the company is not to be trusted. I fail to understand how does this results in the conclusion that the company is not trustworthy or moral. It can be derived that company is rigid, slow, lazy and even a poor investment. Failing to provide a feature(and yes it's a feature not a right - the service is no way mandatory) that might affect a significant (in terms of their reach and not numbers) consumer base makes them a bad service provider - not evil genius.<p>Additionally, this is not the worst of both worlds. Worst of both worlds would be to selectively allow pseudonyms to some and while others have to use real identity. That not only makes the service partial, but skewed towards anarchy (using it for the lack of a replacement).<p>Given a choice between pseudonyms and real identities - the choice is based majorly on the type of culture the networks supports. For example: I tend to use the same username nearly everywhere - unfortunately I can't comment on youtube; the culture is very troll-y and I would not like to be associated <i>at all</i>. On the other hand, Buzz was quite successful in my university - majorly because it was associated with sort-of-a-real identity (Everyone was using clean & real names) which resulted in much saner, smarter interaction that was fun to be a part of. Facebook seems to have achieved the same though <i>real sounding names</i> which is the reason many blogs use their comment system.<p>[edit: typos]",1319115577

3134550,comment,3134240,3134240,15,0,tomgruner,,,"This seems extremely harsh to me. And also stupid not to value this man's contribution to the U.S.<p>In 2004 I arrived in Spain as an American and found a programming job at the international division of a sizable U.S. company. But everything was under the table, and that company did not want to sponsor a visa for me. But even when I was illegal in Spain I still had access to better free health care than the uninsured do in the U.S.<p>Fast forward to 2008, I was still living in Spain and had done some great work for a unrelated startup that was purchased by a much larger U.S. company. I was still in Spain illegally, but this major U.S. company on finding out my status was willing to help me out in any way to become legal here.<p>Spain has something called ""Social Normalization for Exceptional Circumstances"" which means if you have been in the country for three years illegally and have a company sponsor you, they will give you a work visa. You also have to be integrated in the community and speak the local languages well. So in 2008, this major U.S. company paid a lawyer and helped me through that process, something that I am exceptionally grateful for. During the time I worked for this company, my work helped bring in millions of Euros of contracts to the international division of this company in Spain.<p>Now in 2011 I still live in Spain, have the freedom to change jobs or work for myself, and after 7 more years I could become a citizen here, on the condition that I am always working and living in Spain during those years. That means 15 years from illegal to full citizen. I doubt I will stay that long, and don't actually plan on becoming a Spanish citizen, but knowing that if I had a family here and have that option is amazing. Now I am happily working for a Spanish university research group, fully legal.<p>And I have to say, I think it is disgusting to take a man, and especially his son who has lived in the U.S. since the age of two and treat them like criminals when the father has been actively contributing to the U.S. economy in one of the areas that the U.S. excels at. To criminalize this contribution is to spit in the face of all those immigrants who became American and made America what it is today.<p><i>And it is also denying the basic human rights of this individual.This clearly violates Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</i>:<p>Article 15.<p><pre><code>    * (1) Everyone has the right to a nationality.\n    * (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.\n</code></pre>\nI strongly believe that 20 years of crime free residence and contribution to a nation deserves citizenship, and if I choose to, that is what I would receive in Spain after starting here illegaly.<p><i>Edit: As noted in the comments below, actually this does not violate Article 15 at all.

We live in Argentina in large part because when we wanted to marry in 2006, we couldn't get her a permanent visa to live in the USA.<p>Her fiancee visa was in fact quickly approved, pending an interview at the US consulate in Buenos Aires. We waited and waited, called, had our lawyers call, and the response was always ""when the consulate is ready to make an appointment, they will call you."" They never called, leaving us in limbo for over a year and saddled with thousands of dollars in legal fees.<p>Eventually we grew tired of the uncertainty. I moved to Argentina, we got married, and we've lived here ever since.<p>Argentina is not perfect. But the legal status of foreign residents here is much clearer than in the USA. As the husband of a citizen, permanent residency was automatic provided I didn't have a criminal record in my home country (I don't). I am allowed to vote in municipal elections. And, now as the father of an Argentine citizen, citizenship is also automatic if I want it.<p>You might think that Argentina can afford to be generous with immigrants because it has nowhere near the load of foreign residents that the USA does, and to an extent that's certainly true. But on the other hand, Argentina has fairly large immigrant communities (from Peru, Paraguay, Bolivia and China), more social welfare services (basic healthcare is free here), and a lot less financial resources than the USA.<p>Having now lived somewhere else and been on the ""other side"" of the immigration issue, I feel indignant and outraged when I read about how my country treats non-citizen residents.",1319114609

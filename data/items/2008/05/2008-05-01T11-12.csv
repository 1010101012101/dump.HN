178320,comment,177766,177837,0,0,fendale,,,"You may well be correct - perhaps the distributed tools are easier - I need to get one of them installed so I can play around with it to figure it out.<p>That said, if people don't get version control at all (yip, there are plenty of them) then its probably going to be harder to convince them of the merits of both version control and a distributed model at the same time.<p>I have certainly learned in the last few month that changing the direction of a large team is no easy task, and convincing people to use any tool that is even slightly off the beaten track is going to make that task even harder.<p>Its sad - I wish there were more curious, keen to learn people when I work!",1209642789

Universities like it that way, it gives you good motivation to go bring home the bacon.<p>By the way, even your salary number seems low. Perhaps your numbers include teaching colleges?<p>As for summers, they are also a good time to build a startup. Most tenure review committees don't mind that sort of thing.",1209642673

178315,comment,177995,177995,0,0,pistoriusp,,,"A year ago my laptop was due for an upgrade, so I got myself a 2nd hand MacBook Pro. I had never used a Mac, and had been using FreeBSD as a development OS and sometimes a Windows machine when I wanted to play games.<p>I can honestly say that I was not a Apple fanboy. Sure, I liked the way their things looked, but a fanboy? No.<p>A year after owning a Mac... I would never want to go back to a PC. It's simply the best OS that I've ever used.<p>So, how did Apple get me to love their product?<p>Their products look nice. That makes me want to use them and bring them into my ""space."" It's the same reason I consider buying anything: shoes, clothes, cars, chairs, anything.<p>Once I started using their OS it was a pleasant and consistent experience.",1209641452

Please speculate wildly about humanity in the Memristor Age.<p>I don't think we'll have any keeping up with Moore's Law. In 5 years memristor storage will be everywhere.

And 8% is a LOT if they have cumulatively invested 4.5 man-years and you have invested none so far.<p>If they give large percentages to every new person, the math doesn't add up and they'd have little left at the end.",1209640822

178308,comment,178279,178279,0,0,bdfh42,,,"My feeling would be that 2-4% plus a market rate salary would be about right post the first VC funding round. Ahead of that, then the offer feels too low - particularly as you are effectively investing your salary on a monthly basis.<p>One mechanism you could apply - take your personal valuation of the current worth of the business IP and divide it by your notional annual salary for the next couple of years. What percentage does that come out at?",1209640689

In most places I've seen, they're happy to calculate raises using %, which means you get a whopping 20% raise on a £20k salary - which still amounts to peanuts (£24k is not much different from £20k).<p>Negotiate your starting salary as high as you can, and don't count on quick raises.<p>Here's a useful article on the topic from ever-helpful Rands:<p><a href=""http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/04/11/the_business.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/04/11/the_busines...</a><p>Daniel",1209640668

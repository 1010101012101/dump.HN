I anticipated this to be approximately a 20 ~ 30 line job.  Two weeks later, we received a scratch-built HTTP client which supported precisely one verb and two handwritten serialization schemes, with half the code containing precisely one comment in English by way of Babelfish and the other half containing very literate English comments like you would expect from code developed at a multinational with a legal department better funded than the armed forces of of most NATO countries.<p>I pray your mileage varies.",1280156355

1548156,comment,1547964,1547964,0,0,yardie,,,"Is it at all possible to change the title from Europe to Germany. Most of his complaints are German specific and don't apply to everywhere in Europe.<p>Bureaucracy: I've heard regularly bad things about the German bundes. I've heard good things about UK, Sweden, Romania, Hungary.<p>Labor: Whether you get it here or there the price of labor is only going up, but in China it's going up faster. Programmers are expensive. I'm expensive. If a better offer comes along that you can't match or even come close to I'll be out the door faster than the computer can shutdown. (Of course with my 2 weeks-1 month notice first). Don't expect anything less from the chinese. I don't know what you are working but have you ever hired anyone straight out of college? Experience costs money and mistakes costs money. Just make sure the latter costs less than the former.<p>Costs and Taxes: Depending on the European country you may not pay any taxes on revenue while in the startup phase (generally 2 years). After that it's country specific, the rules that apply in Germany don't apply in the UK.<p>Travel: Maybe as a German these things don't matter to you, but, as an American, I find Europe to be fascinating, so many different cultures, so much history, and its all packed in one half continent. When I speak to other french or english friends about SE Asia it's generally ""which beach should I visit this week?"". Little interest in the culture, history, or the language (I love ordering food in thai, but that's all the thai I know). I think a lot of people have a very romantic idea of what SE Asia is about but that's it. Plus it's huge region, you need a plane to do all that traveling and those flights aren't short.<p>It looks like you've traded one set of problems for another. I don't know what the startup will ultimately be about but I wish you luck. Also be careful, lots of people have startup ideas that fizzle out, can't get funding, or can't get any promotion because it's not from the right place. One thing I've learned about a company is that it's the people you know as well as the idea that make it a success. If you are doing it in China, then have a chinese focus because no one in San Francisco is going to care about it, until it's too big to ignore.",1280155731

I also missed somewhat longer, continuous action sequences. In Inception, every action sequence was over in 30 seconds, with everything happening in a dream (death just means you wake up), so it removed what little tension these sequences carried. (But then sometimes the in-game rules were broken, eg. the Jap. guy get shot but he doesn't wake up, so from then on shots are lethal? Well I guess not, because at the end everybody is fine after all.)<p>Interestingly, the overall plot's tension, whether the act of Inception succeeds remained, but the action sequences just didn't work. The plot's overall tension worked for me exactly until they went into yet another dream/coma state called limbo, at which point I just lost interest.<p>As PaulJoslin said, a much more effective film could have been built on these core ideas.",1280155385

In contrast, many AAA corporate and govt bonds have long lifetimes and high repayment rates (until recently, mortgages did as well).

Still to me it reflected the cultural differences between 'proper' engineers who are strict and rigorous and like to stick to proven solutions and people in software who are, in general, more wild west and in favor of change for change's sake.",1280153764

Generally you then start cheating by passing around a function pointer and a void* that is the first argument of the function, i.e. doing closure conversion yourself. You can hide this with some macros and get close to having a functional language, but it's ugly and tedious (Cfront anyone?) Also, what I'm describing here is more similar to object orientation than functional programming. It's worth remembering the following koan though:<p>The venerable master Qc Na was walking with his student, Anton. Hoping to prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said ""Master, I have heard that objects are a very good thing - is this true?"" Qc Na looked pityingly at his student and replied, ""Foolish pupil - objects are merely a poor man's closures.""<p>Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell, intent on studying closures. He carefully read the entire ""Lambda: The Ultimate..."" series of papers and its cousins, and implemented a small Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object system. He learned much, and looked forward to informing his master of his progress.<p>On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by saying ""Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand that objects are truly a poor man's closures."" Qc Na responded by hitting Anton with his stick, saying ""When will you learn? Closures are a poor man's object."" At that moment, Anton became enlightened.<p>-- Anton van Straaten",1280152968

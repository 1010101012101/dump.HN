5233758,comment,5233481,5233727,1,0,goodcanadian,,,"There has been plenty of controversy over the meaning of IQ tests in the first place. One complaint is that they test cultural knowledge more than intelligence itself. Naturally, there will be some correlation between the two, but my point is that a great deal of what IQ tests test may be learned knowledge. While your ability to learn that knowledge may be related to intelligence, it does not follow that all intelligent people will score highly on a particular IQ test. Intelligence may be heritable even if IQ test performance is not.",1361062214

Look at my peers of around the same age as me. Many are independently wealthy. Those at executive or C-level (Chief of...) positions make similar salaries, not counting stock options from public companies which generally remunerate them to a much greater degree.<p>I'm not looking for a new job, but I get head-hunter contacts often enough. From the non-startups, the promised packages are as good or better in terms of salary. Doing a startup would mean a reduction in exchange for more founders' equity.<p>I have had invitations and targeted recruiting pitches from Google starting in 2002 and running up to this year. Had I gone in 2002, I would be set for life.

This is especially true lately with lots of travel, which is not easy on my wife and small children.<p>Meanwhile, open source means living in a fishbowl, and Mozilla with its mission and people-first social movement roots means finding a business structure that doesn't loot our brand or screw volunteers by trying to cash out via an IPO or acquisition.<p>The structure that we chose was a U.S. 501(c)(3) Foundation, with IRS approval up front, but then with IRS reneging after a couple of years, followed by a fight to deny us our status and tax our early revenue that had been declared tax-free at the time by that same agency.<p>In the course of this ""package audit"", I had the joy of a personal IRS audit, which I passed cleanly (I defended myself). And Mozilla prevailed on the question of its public benefit status.<p>I don't live in Atherton or Palo Alto. I don't drive a fancy car. I'm in a house built in 1960 that was enlarged in the '70s but is modest by any standard (and very messy right now!).<p>So, do you really think I am just in this for the money?<p>This is not a boast, it doesn't make me great or even good. Like most who have some years of sustained work and credit/blame on their backs, I am little by myself. I'm much less than some truly great people who work for a good cause for no more, and often a lot less, than I make.<p>I am 100% sure that I could not persuade most of Mozilla's top talent of anything if I were merely an empty suit adding no value and sucking a big salary.<p>So it is just galling to hear your spin on thetruthaboutmozilla, which by the way seemed in that 2007 piece to say that I was worth every penny (not that I'm giving it any credence :-|).<p>If I'm right that Mozilla matters, then it matters no matter what I make or where I go. If I'm valuable to Mozilla, then my staying will help. I have to consider that too, in negotiating compensation.<p>""Know thyself"" is as important now as it was at Delphi in ancient Greece.

His comment is:<p>""For several years (2001-2005) we've already had the situation when the single browser engine (Trident, MSIE) had the dominant share of 90% and more. Indeed, this was bad for the Web as a platform, pretty much in ways the article describes.<p>However this time we've got a difference: new dominant browser engine is open-source with a very liberal license (BSD, LGPL). So anyone who is not satisfied with the development of WebKit is welcome to fork. In fact, Google has replaced JavaScriptCore (part of WebKit) with V8.<p>So is there actually any reasons for having competitive open-source full browser stacks? I believe licensing reasons (the one behind FreeBSD and Linux) is not very important for browser world (Gecko and WebKit have very similar licensing terms). And I don't see much ideological reasons that can't be fixed by forking.<p>What else? Usually developers hate abandoning their work and switching to improve competitor's solutions  especially in the open source world. Developers like the feeling of doing important stuff and money. Market share of Firefox is still quite high (~25%) and Mozilla still receives money (company is non-profit, but developers are being paid I believe). Probably for this reasons the struggle will continue for some time.<p>However it is difficult to assume that there is something useful for web platform in this struggle. Every new web standard feature requires independent implementation from two different open-source projects and the whole platform adoption process goes as fast as the slowest team goes.""",1361061288

This is about eighteen or maybe nineteen, give or take, <i>trillion</i> times more important than posting style. A long multi-party conversation is a complex beast with a lot of subtleties, by checkpointing and summarizing the state of the conversation you can ensure that people are not misunderstanding or operating under incorrect or different assumptions and you save a lot of time and effort for getting other folks up to speed as they become involved. Additionally, a lot of times there will be conversations that occur in meetings or over the phone or IM which might involve additional information or decisions which everyone in the thread at the moment understands implicitly but isn't actually spelled out, making it that much more difficult for other folks to understand.<p>Make it a habit to always be thinking ""does everyone have the same information and assumptions in this conversation?"" as well as ""what roadblocks do people have in reading this thread to get to that state?""

5233689,comment,5232415,5233386,6,0,Cogito,,,"This is still not quite correct. Let me outline the structure, and then I will try and submit a PR addressing it.<p>The first step to committing is staging what should be included.<p>The staging process specifies an <i>index</i> of files that are to be added to the next commit. When the commit is recorded, git checks every file/chunk in the index; a hash is calculated per each of these <i>blobs</i>, each blob and hash are stored in a key<->object store, the <i>object store</i>, and the hashes are written into the index of the commit.<p>If a blob already exists in the store then it is not added again.<p>When changes are made and committed after this point, the resulting blobs are then hashed and stored again. Any unchanged blob does not need to be stored again; any changed blobs are stored.<p>When a commit is recreated, it's index is evaluated. Each blob is retrieved from the object store and placed into the tree in the appropriate location.<p>The most important thing to take out of this? Rebuilding a tree from blobs is <i>fast</i>. Second thing to take out? Git only stores each <i>version</i> of a blob (be it a file or a chunk) once, so most 'unpacked' repositories are still quite small.<p>Now, this is obviously not the smallest representation of the repository, so git has a <i>packed</i> format which calculates deltas between blob files. This will calculate blob-deltas even if they are completely separated in the history; deltas are not between commits, instead they are between objects. Unpacking deltas recreates the blob objects required to build the tree.<p>The packing process happens every now and then, but it is definitely not done every time a commit is made (by default). The most visible place it is used is when transferring over network protocols (I can't recall if it is done for <i>every</i> network transfer, but I suspect it is). It is done when running garbage collection as well.<p>----<p>The reason why all this is important is as I laid out before: rebuilding trees is fast, which makes fast branching possible, and the object store allows this without exploding the size of the repository.",1361060726

Write s=sqrt(2) -- which is of course irrational -- and consider s^s. If it's rational then we're done.

5233615,comment,5233428,5233527,10,0,viraptor,,,"> As far as I'm concerned, a top-poster is either a narcissist or very inexperienced in Internet communications. Or both.<p>I bet you've not been exposed to many corporate email chains. Top-posting makes a lot of sense there. I often get copied on an email chains from which only the last part affects me. For example it will be a long discussion about some task and then I'll get copied because I'm the person who does X and need to help out. Bottom posting wouldn't work here for a number of reasons:<p>- I don't care about the project and its planning 20 emails ago - but I still may need some information from those emails. What I need is the task (at the very top) and context if required (at the bottom).<p>- If anyone tried to edit the history by removing unnecessary parts, they'd most likely remove the parts not important to them, but later on same questions would get repeated as soon as new people join the conversation.<p>- Leaving all needed parts and bottom posting / replying inline would result in 20+ levels of nesting and each inline section would become its own thread. This is just not possible to manage without some public archive with thread support.<p>Both styles have sense in different environments. I bottom-post to public mailing lists, because it makes more sense there. I top-post to other people at work where exchange==email, because it makes more sense there.<p>I used to bring up the same argument and the same quote about why top-posting is bad - but I guess I was wrong - I just didn't see the issue from the other side at that point. This makes me think that people top-posting in html on public mailing lists simply don't understand the other side either, but may adjust with time. As long as we don't assume either side is narcissistic and allow the possibility that we're not experienced in every possible scenario of Internet communication, we may just get along... Just try to adjust to the audience and environment sometimes. This may mean top-posting to some office; as well as fighting with your POS outlook to allow you to bottom-post to a mailing list in plaintext without any attachments.",1361059386
5233614,comment,5233057,5233489,5,0,just2n,,,"I disagree entirely. This is an inflammatory piece that is factually full of nonsensical claims that don't and haven't held up. It makes HUGE assumptions that have direct contradictions in practice. I don't see how anyone could take it seriously. As for not ""talking shit"" about WebKit, let's look at that one claim:<p>> Backwards bug compatibility<p>This is obviously pointed at what IE did after years of maintaining the same bugs that people relied on. The article actually figured out WHY this happened: taking a year to fix a MAJOR issue results in people relying on it. IE was always updated very, very slowly. Nobody else really had this problem, and IE is the one who instilled major flaws as ""features"" and refused to correct them later on. This very much describes exactly what Microsoft did with IE.<p>But then they try to ascribe that, somehow, with major handwaving as a problem that will be seen if everyone uses the same code base. This coming on the heels of Opera deciding to use WebKit. It's very clear they are making the claim that the same problems IE was having would be caused by WebKit. This is called talking shit.<p>The problem is that these problems were caused by a well known phenomenon: taking years to fix major issues. Google has maintained a PHENOMENAL rate of development on their own browser, and they aren't even competing with Mozilla anymore, they're way out in front. Pushes to stable are slower but Canary is updated almost daily. I've seen major bugs and regressions get fixed in HOURS. And I've seen independent players issue patches to fix problems.<p>This is a picture that is antithetical to IE. It is the POLAR OPPOSITE of the scenario under which this problem initially became so egregious. There is no basis for this claim. And to the point that we ""NEED"" multiple implementations of a standard to find where things are ambiguous, please feel free to peruse the discussion groups at your leisure. Not only are these ambiguities discussed without referencing Firefox, IE, or anyone else, but they're often resolved with changes in the implementation or, rarely, in the spec. This would be an impossibility if we all worked on 1 code base, clearly.",1361059355

Isotropic coordinates are continuous at the horizon, which is at R = M/2 (where R is the isotropic radial coordinate and M is the mass of the hole); but the region R < M/2 corresponds to the <i>exterior</i> of the horizon, not the interior.<p>The standard interpretation of this is that isotropic coordinates double cover the same exterior region (which is labeled region I on a Kruskal diagram like the one in Figure 2 on the ScienceDirect page); in other words, for every value of R < M/2, there is a corresponding value of R > M/2 that labels the <i>same</i> point in the same exterior region.<p>Poplawski's paper appears to claim that there is a valid alternate interpretation in which the region R < M/2 is a second, separate exterior region (labeled region III on a Kruskal diagram). That interpretation appears to me to violate the Einstein Field Equation, but I'm still digesting the paper (see my other posts in this thread).",1361059222

5518032,comment,5517368,5517368,1,0,jrockway,,,"The real question is: does an indelible record of transactions actually make it difficult to perform illegal activity?  I can see arguments either way, but this will ultimately the interesting question.<p>On the surface, it seems like it would be easy to send coins and disbursement instructions to a big pool somewhere.  Then someone watching the network sees a node that eats and emits coins, but doesn't make it obvious which source/destination were involved in one transaction.  (Similarly, your bank sees a check to your credit card company each month, but doesn't know or care what exactly you bought on that credit card.)<p>Even without a ""dark pool"", I don't think the block chain verification requires each transaction counterparty pair to be identified.  Imagine you print out a bitcoin and give it to someone in person.  This reduces the value of the coin, since you could have made multiple copies and the first copy wins when spent on the real network.  But people performing illegal activities already pay a lot for the risk, so this would be nothing new.<p>Anyway, I mostly stopped reading the linked article when I looked at the banner at the top of the page.",1365515695

5518016,comment,5513237,5517579,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"I've given the generally relevant pieces on my blog, with varying degrees of cover. However, naming the specific company is what I've been debating over the past year. Thus far, I've chosen not to do it.<p>The reason I'm hesitant is that good engineers (who don't deserve it) might suffer more than the management (which does). I learned the hard way that whistleblowing often hurts the more vulnerable good guys first.<p>It's a startup of about 100 people. I could demolish this company's reputation with a few keystrokes, but the executives (who deserve it) would probably be just fine. It's the engineers who'd suffer-- having a disgraced company on their resumes-- and I hate that that's the case, but such is life.<p>What happened is that there was a ""War of Three VP/Eng's"". There was an unofficial VP/Eng (call him Dan) who did a really good job. However, with <i>four</i> product pivots in three years (the CEO was an idiot, but kept being able to raise capital because of family connections) there were legacy and code-quality issues. Top management threw Dan (even though he was a true 2.0+ engineer) under the bus, and the CTO pulled in a 25-year-old protege (call him Tony) who was fucking <i>terrible</i>. He knew basic programming, but this was his first white-collar job; story was that he'd burned out of college and was in retail before the CTO ""rediscovered"" him. Tony's quite intelligent and he can talk with the best of them, but he's technically mediocre and a genuine psychopath.<p>Dan had engineer support; Tony had management support but engineers disliked him because he was an obvious case of an incompetent protege. Tony's ""rearchitecture"" fucked the company badly. I was brought in as a 3rd VP/Eng (and actually promised the title, at the 6-month mark) to resolve it.<p>There were good engineers on both the old and new teams, and resolving the technical disagreements was easy. But in March 2012 it was clear that my real reason for being hired into the company was to give management a credible excuse to toss away half of the old team. I either had to sign a bunch of documentation that'd be used to justify Pincus-type moves against 11 of my colleagues, or give up my contention for the VP/Eng role since (apparently) that's just want managers have to do. I chose the latter-- really didn't want to be managerial in such a toxic company-- but Tony convinced management that if I was throwing in the towel for VP/Eng, I should be shown out entirely.<p>This wasn't only out of ethical altruism. I did the right thing for good reasons, but I also had no choice. If I signed the papers and gotten a bunch of undeserving engineers fired (or at least put through humiliating PIPs that would probably involve equity clawbacks) then I'd lose credibility and Tony would win. Tony (angling for CTO once the existing one burned out, which he did around the time I left) teamed up with management to set it up so that I would be the one getting dirty in the Pincus move. He could be the good guy CTO and I'd be the bad guy VP/Eng, the rubber glove used for evil work and thrown away. It'd be career suicide because no engineer would work with me after that.<p>It wasn't the rewrite that killed that company. The rearchitecture was a symptom of psychopathic management and a really horrible CTO-protege-cum-unofficial-VP-Eng. Still, it makes me extremely skeptical every time I interview with a company and hear, ""We're throwing out all the old code"" because I know how politically fucked-up that often is.",1365515525

5517985,comment,5517787,5517928,9,0,FooBarWidget,,,"Phusion Passenger is an application server that supports Python (WSGI) and Ruby (Rack). It does not wrap around Nginx and Apache, it <i>integrates</i> into Nginx and Apache. From a user's point of view, it behaves like an Apache/Nginx module, i.e.:<p>1. You configure it through the web server.<p>2. Everything you need is started along with the web server, and shut down along with the web server. You don't need to start any external components and hook them into the web server. Compared to many other alternatives, this reduces the amount of moving parts and makes administration easier.<p>Technically, it runs a lot of stuff outside the web server's address space for stability reasons. All your actual apps do not run inside the web server, but in their own processes. It uses a lot of Unix technologies under the hood to make things stable and robust, though it hides all that from the user. The philosophy is that software should Just Work(tm) and that everything should be as easy as possible for the user, even if that means Phusion Passenger's own authors have to write tons of code to make it so.<p>Here are some of the things it does for your web app:<p>- It manages your processes: starts them when needed, shuts them down when not needed, restarts them when any crashed. This way you don't have to setup process supervision systems like Monit, God, Daemontools, etc for your apps.<p>- It manages your sockets in a smart way. It buffers requests and responses in order to protect you from slow clients and other network issues.<p>- It provides easy security by running your apps as the right user, so that you don't have to setup su/sudo scripts.<p>- It manages your resources. It limits the number of processes to prevent your system from running out of memory. It can automatically adjust the number of processes based on traffic, so that an app is only active when it's actually being used.",1365515189

Since technological advancement tends to make it easier to produce ""things"" in real terms, a perfect currency reflects this and makes time preference inherently valuable.<p><i>facepalm</i> If the ""natural tendency"" of capitalism is for prices to deflate, and you want time preference to not be defined by the currency, then exactly what you want is for the currency to be inflationary! Otherwise, you now have two compounding forces toward hoarding, or ""late"" time preference: capitalism, which drives future prices down, and the currency (Bitcoin, gold...) which also drives prices down -- since, when we say a currency is deflationary, like Bitcoin is, we mean it deflates goods' prices over time... Needless to say, that should fuck the economy up pretty badly, <i>by your own admission</i>.<p>To be fair, it was an interesting argument, until he just freaked out and confused up for down. Or deflation for inflation, whatever. And this is supposed to be one of the founding fathers of the Tea Party, by the way?<p>> This in turn forces the producers of goods and services to innovate in order to attract your economic surplus from under the mattress and into their cash registers, since not spending your economic surplus is in fact to your advantage.<p>Yeah, this forces producers to <i>work harder</i> in order to get <i>paid the same</i>. That this means a production glut is left as an (easy!) exercise for the reader. Extra points if you develop your conclusions regarding debt and interest under this currency.<p>To be fair, I completely agree with his comparison of Bitcoin to a pyramid scheme. It's funny how the dude has such a tenuous grasp over the most basic economics, that he gets it right <i>by pure accident</i> and for all the wrong reasons.<p>> That means that if you were one of the early adopters you get paid through the difficulty of those who attempt to mine coins later!  That is, your value increases because the later person's expenditure of energy increases rather than through your own expenditure of energy.  If that sounds kind of like a pyramid scheme, it's because it is very similar to to how the ""early adopters"" in all pyramid schemes get a return -- your later and ever-increasing effort for each subsequent unit of return accrues far more to the early adopter than it does to you!<p>You know what? <i>This is exactly the definition of a deflationary currency</i>. He just admitted BTC is a pyramidal scheme because it's deflationary! But, of course, he's a right-wing pundit, he can't admit that! What to do? No matter, some pseudo-cryptography, pseudo-physics bullshit (<i>entropy</i>, of all things!) saves the day... Now I'm just fucking screaming at the screen...

If you delay buying some good or service, because you expect it to become cheaper later on, then you are also depriving yourself of the benefit you expect from it. So, in a deflationary environment, you'll only delay buying something if you think that the money that you save is worth more than what you're losing from not enjoying the benefits of that product for that amount of time.<p>You need to eat to stay alive, and staying alive is more important to you than saving money, so food purchases won't be delayed very long. You don't need to play video games to stay alive, so you can wait for a couple of years to buy a video game when it becomes cheaper; some people do it to save money while other people decide that they prefer to pay more and be able to play that new video game right away (some even pay a premium if it is sold out, even though they know they could pay regular price by waiting a few days).",1365514111

I'll leave it at that.<p><i>If you are performing well and get poor calibration scores (which aren't secret)</i><p>You get a range for your calibration score. Whether your manager tells you the specific number is up to him, and you have no way of knowing whether he's telling the truth. Most Googlers will get Meets Expectations (3.0-3.4) which ranges from the 2nd to 70th percentile. For most, it means ""solidly OK, but not yet promotable"". 3.5-3.9 is Exceeds (70th-95th percentile) and means ""on track for promotion"" and 4.0+ is Strongly Exceeds (95+) which means ""promotable"". Almost never are numbers below 3.0 or above 4.5 used, because sub-3.0 requires PIP/termination proceedings (which are a lot of work for the manager) and 4.5+ makes an employee eligible very large cash bonuses (and, occasionally, double-promotes).<p>If your manager gives you 3.0's but positive verbal feedback, you'll think you're getting 3.3-3.4 (which is perfectly respectable) but you won't be able to transfer. Except for the first quarter, 3.0 means, ""you suck but I'm too busy to deal with the PIP/termination process""; 2.x requires the manager to do a bunch of extra work so 3.0 is understood as the ""he's awful but I don't feel like doing anything about it"" score.<p>However, there are managers who give positive verbal feedback and 3.0-3.1 ratings to keep good people captive. You didn't see what I saw. I have data but I'm not allowed to share it because I'm not supposed to have a lot of that stuff myself. It's not <i>most</i> managers who do that shit, but it's a sizable contingent and executives are aware of the problem.

In any company. Please, I encourage you to do it. You sound like just a wonderful person and I'd love to see you take a crack at it.<p>Nah... I'll tell you what happens, not because I give a shit about you, but because other people are reading.<p>If you go to HR, you get fired. Not ""officially terminated"" because the company doesn't want the lawsuit risk, but HR and your manager will make it look like (a) no one else in the company wanted you so (b) they can PIP and eventually terminate you. You won't be able to transfer because ""you have to solve the problem where you are before you move on"" and because there will be feces smeared across your personnel file. This known in HR-speak as ""passive firing"". With passive firing, the employee is technically permitted transfer but it is made impossible. It's a way to give managers unilateral termination without the lawsuit risk.<p>If you go to your boss^2, you are similarly fucked, because your boss^2 <i>picked your boss</i>, idiot. Who do you think he'll side with? If you seriously think that a boss^2 is going to take the side of an underling, then please, try to make it happen the next time you are checkmated. If you have a shitty boss, your boss^2 knows and is tolerating him because it's expedient, if wrong.<p>If you want to jump your boss, you have to go to the boss^3 or higher, and the probability of that working is low because the social distance and credibility gap is high. But you have much better odds with a boss^3 than a boss^2.

The purchase is what matters, because if the purchase is illegal that's what's putting you at risk no matter the amount of money.<p>Of course, once you start dealing in large amounts of currency - USD or BTC - that's when you start increasing risk because governments keep an eye out for large amounts of money being moved around. At that point, I think you'd have reason to be concerned about people simply tracking your large transactions towards their destination and using <i>that</i> to identify you.<p>The upside of more robust record-keeping does seem like a potential upside, though, I agree.",1365512438

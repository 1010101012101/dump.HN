Like many other Crockford-inspired takes on the subject, vjeux's article is massively bad advice.<p>Firstly, __proto__ is nonstandard, and deprecated. If you write JavaScript that uses it, it won't run in all JS runtimes.<p>Object.create is similarly not available everywhere. It's not available in Firefox < 4, IE < 9, or any version of Opera. Crockford's version of Object.create is not compatible with the native Object.create -- and if you patch it in, you may end up breaking libraries that expect the real thing.<p>But let's say you had it all sorted out, and you had a sane plan for using the native Object.create, and falling back to Crockford's implementation where unavailable ... it's still not a great pattern:<p><a href=""http://jsperf.com/object-create-vs-crockford-vs-jorge-vs-constructor/10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/object-create-vs-crockford-vs-jorge-vs-con...</a><p>Running that again today, I see that in Chrome, instantiating objects via Object.create -- either Crockford's or native -- is over <i>95%</i> slower than using a regular constructor function. We're talking about just creating basic objects here, low-level stuff: how fast you can do it is pretty important if you're aiming for high-performance JavaScript.<p>The prototype property, constructor functions, and ""new"" are the way that JavaScript objects work, and the way that engines are tuned to optimize JS code. Avoid learning to use them at your own peril.",1306601874

Needing to type ""return"" itself is a minor detail, but explicit returns are a strong sign of having statement-oriented semantics, rather than expression-oriented semantics.<p>In languages based around statements, things are done for their side-effects. Returning a value is itself a kind of side-effect, hence an explicit return statement.<p>In languages based around expressions (Lisp, ML & Haskell, APL, etc.), the <i>language itself</i> gently encourages side-effect-free programming. In Scheme, for example, you usually use a <i>begin</i> block when you need to do things for their side-effects. While it doesn't prevent side-effects entirely, it does make them stand out, and adds a subtle pressure against their overuse.",1306601252

If you work in a high-power job, I'd wager that about 1-in-8 of your co-workers is on a psychiatric medication. For a lot of people, they're like eyeglasses: a mildly annoying, but not really painful, treatment that nonetheless allows them to function at full capacity once taken.<p>Compared to real mental illness, the side effects of these drugs are minor. Real depression and panic (both of which most people never experience) are more dangerous than the milder, first-line treatments for those illnesses, which are a lot less drastic than frontal lobotomy.<p>What is important is to separate normal emotions (which can be plenty difficult, but shouldn't be medicated away) from actual mental illness. This is a tough judgment call to make and it isn't always made right, especially with regard to teenagers. For example, if you're sad because someone close to you died, this is normal and you shouldn't be on meds for it. That's not clinical depression; it's normal sadness.<p>For the record, when the dosage is right, people still experience the normal emotions (sadness when something sad happens, anger when appropriate) but don't have the biological problems (the thought loops, mental fatigue, irrational fear and anger).

First thing and probably most important, don't do this by yourself. Find a professional you can work with, either a psychiatrist or psychologist with PA assistant (PA handles the prescriptions). This is vastly more important then the maxim about walking into a court without a lawyer. Second thing; understand that the process will take time. The combinations involve just about everything you can imagine. They factor in drugs and drug combinations, amount, timing, your health, your activities the nature of your form of depression, etc. The list may feel endless, but it is necessary in order to avoid some of the negatives you mention. As a for instance an early venture eliminated 'rage' as a problem for me, but made it impossible to play tournament chess---if you don't care about winning, winning is quite difficult! The third thing is to persist; this is the most important battle of your life, nothing else matters. Most of your anxieties that you mention are either mythic or a result of your current condition.

2594682,comment,2594153,2594340,11,0,lotharbot,,,"My simplified summary/explanation [0]:<p>Several flight instruments rely on air pressure.  If one of your pressure gauges gets blocked, you can get very misleading data.<p>This guy's theory as to what happened in this case is that the forward pressure tube (pitot tube) had an ice blockage, which led to a low airspeed reading.  The autopilot tried to correct by accelerating the plane.  Since loaded jetliners normally fly slightly nose-up to maintain altitude [1], the autopilot kept that orientation as it accelerated, which led to a climb and ultimately a stall.<p>When the plane stalled, it started dropping altitude rapidly -- but with a blocked pressure line, this could misleadingly report a high airspeed due to the increase in external pressure.  As the pilots took over, they were (according to this guy's theory) trying to reduce airspeed by cutting the throttle and nosing up.  Rather than fixing an overspeed condition, they were actually making the stall worse.  They never would have realized what was happening because their instruments kept reporting overspeed.<p>[0] I'm not a pilot, but I worked in an aerospace museum's education department, and learned a lot from the pilots and engineers who volunteered with us.<p>[1] According to one of the volunteers, who was also an engineer for one of the big jetliners, loaded jetliners get about half of their lift by keeping their wings 3-6 degrees above level.  The exact angle is selected based on load and airspeed; get it wrong, and you'll accidentally climb or descend.",1306599737

2594664,comment,2594495,2594495,93,0,michaelochurch,,,"He did a better job of addressing this issue than Noah Kagan, who was talking about mild fatigue rather than real depression (yes, there's a huge difference). Let me add:<p>6. Exercise, with a mix of activities: swimming, running (outdoor is better) and strength training. He mentioned that the brain interprets social isolation as a sign of low status. It also interprets physical activity (or the lack thereof) much in the same way. Using your body (running, swimming, hiking) tells the brain that you're an alpha and that it needs to step it up a notch. Mild depression is when the body and brain go into gamma mode (more severe depression is a biological dysfunction of that system) which would be a form of hibernation, as observed in medieval mountain communities during winter, but society isn't tolerant of that, so it leads to misery. (Some mild depressives would be fine, aside from the loss of time, if they could sleep 11-14 hours per day.)<p>7. Avoid cigarettes at all costs. Use alcohol sparingly: one drink is fine, but it takes a week to recover from a night of serious drinking... and if you're coding, you actually notice the loss. Avoid drugs like cocaine and heroin like the plague. Jury's still out on occasional use of LSD or shrooms (but people with <i>any</i> history of mental illness need to be very cautious) but they certainly shouldn't be a habit.<p>8. Relax. Sometimes it's necessary to spend time in the woods and just (sorry for sounding hippy-dippy) be mindful. 24/7 Internet connectivity is not always helpful.<p>9. Read novels and watch movies. There's something healing about narrative that isn't provided by (as much as they are enjoyable to read) books about formal semantics of programming languages.<p>10. Music. It helps. I have a lot of friends who say they never would have gotten through their teenage years, or a bad turn of business, without music.<p>11. Go somewhere new, do something different. It doesn't have to be an ""exotic"" or expensive vacation; if your goal is to heal, it's better that it not be. Just a trip to visit friends 50 km away can help.<p>12. 2 weeks of real vacation, as an absolute minimum, per year. Take unpaid leave if you need to. Four weeks is best. Total productivity is maximal at 3 weeks of vacation and per-day productivity is maximized at 7-9. Europeans have it figured out: you need <i>two</i> types of vacation: exploration vacations to new places (Alaska, Cambodia, Andes) where difficulty and stress are OK and relaxation vacations where stress levels are low and variation of activity is not required. Unfortunately, Americans get stuck having to choose one or the other, and generally do only the first kind of vacation when they're young and only the second kind when they're old.<p>For the record, if you only get 1-2 weeks but can take unpaid leave without it hurting your career, you probably should. A 2% pay drop for an extra week of vacation is worth it IMO.<p>13. Fruits and vegetables. The casual arrow is unclear and probably goes both ways, but depressed people tend to eat a lot of white carbs. Americans tend to get dieting wrong, as if it's some set of religious prohibitions that have to be followed to the letter, when in reality there are few foods one should <i>never</i> eat. Instead of dieting negatively (""I won't eat X"") it's better to diet positively and replace unhealthy foods with better alternatives (e.g. 70+ percent of your desserts should be fruit).<p>14. ""Don't fuck crazy"". High-power programming/technology, as a career, is only 10-20% more time-intensive than the average job-- you haven't seen bad hours till you've worked on Wall Street-- but it's 200% more energy-intensive.

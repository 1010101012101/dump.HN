The dev side is a separate db (git could represent this), and once something is published past dev the record is copied to the production db (Riak in your case). The dbs have in-memory local machine cached versions, for speed, but also for reliability. You don't want your N machines depending on one db point of failure, so the local cached copies exist to mitigate that. (They receive updates via a multicast mechanism.)",1312520100

But at RAD we almost exclusively work in C (and assembly, for dozens of platforms). C++ inherited C's broken model for separate compilation with all that implies about physical design for large code bases.

After my credit card got skimmed a couple of times, I looked into how easy it is. For a few hundred bucks you get a magnetic strip reader / writer and you're in business cloning cards.<p>The hacks they mentioned:<p>- Read data from a card with a square reader. Whoop dee doo... a square reader has to do that  to process a transaction. They are just capturing that outside of the app?<p>- Extract the cash from a gift card - Afaik, there's nothing nefarious about this. I had a gift card for $500... paid the processing fee to square and got the cash in my account. Great hack<p>- Process a transaction without the physical card - You can do that already in square, it just costs you more.<p>It doesn't make it easier to commit fraud IN square. You still need a tax id / social security number to set up an account. And you need to have a bank account connected.<p>Really, what it makes it easier to do is to skim credit card numbers.

As the entire ecosystem I am in is built on horses eating carrots, all growth eventually turns into me making even more money: I am flush with cash and have the worlds largest silos and most interesting farm equipment.<p>Given that I have so much cash, and pretty much all the worlds strongest farmhands work for me, I decide to ""have some fun"": I build ""ok"" stuff an give it away for free.<p>I mean, sure: there's some guy out there selling buggy whips, and they are awesome, but I can just hand our buggy whips /constantly/: they fall apart, but they work, and many (most?) people don't care.<p>You could say I'm ""losing money"" on the buggy whips, but the fact that people were spending that money on buggy whips is just more money they weren't spending on carrots, so I am not losing as much as you'd think.<p>However, my ""competitors"" (do I even bother to think of them as such?... they are pretty much ants in comparison) find it harder an harder to operate in this environment: they need to actually make money on those whips.<p>Even worse, customers don't even seem to realize anymore that buggy whips have any underlying cost: or anything else, really. People who offer buggy whips for money are seen as ""greedy"", and customers even start to question why they are paying money for saddles... some even call for me to make those for free too (and why not: consider it done).<p>This turn of events is awkward, and damaging on the entire economy: I am simply going aroun messing with every market I consider smaller than me, messing with the incentives.<p>Why? Partly fun, but it is certainly difficult to discount ""power"" as a contributing factor: it is a wonderful feeling to see my bran on every product, and make everyone super reliant on me for /everything/, not kist their carrots. Hell: people even like me more, because I'm obviously so ""altruistic"".<p>Now, how can I do this? It is not that I have some awesome ""free or freemium business model"": it is only because I have a mear monopoly on carrots. If I had any serious competitors on carrots, their prices would be lower, as they wouldn't be wasting cash handing people free buggy whips (and free everything else, even stuff totally unrelated to carrots).<p>This /is/ leveraging a monopoly. If you can do something that accumulates power and assets that is only possible because you have a monopoly and you choose to actually take advantage of it, that /is/ leveraging.<p>Of course, it is also important to ask ""is it legal?"", and the answer might very well be ""yes"". Bundling, a specific form of leverage that Microsoft was using, was considered illegal, but I am not a lawyer and have no clue how comprehensive the laws were.<p>But seriously: you cannot imagine that it is an efficient use of our economic resources to have Google buying up anyone who sells something awesome (including Android: that was an acquisition) so they can give it away for free instead.",1312518353

I don't go jogging (very much) when I'm shooting for muscle gain. The reason is that it wears down my joints and this results in poorer performance when I lift. In addition, you want to avoid burning calories when you're trying to gain muscle (especially during a recovery period).<p>2. Crunches will more likely hurt your back than help you make meaningful gains. If you're doing push-ups and squats correctly and in good quantity, you're getting more than enough of an ab workout. They won't show up unless you cut body fat, anyways. You can work on that after you've put on a bunch of muscle, if that's your thing.<p>3. Curls are mostly effective for biceps, but won't really help you make large muscle gains. If you're doing push-ups, you'll get both a bicep and tricep workout along with your chest.<p>4. Improve your diet! Lots of lean organic protein, no crappy carbs or sugary snacks. Increase your caloric intake during weight training, especially during recovery days.<p>If you don't have access to a gym, the best exercises you can do for muscle gain are push-ups, squats, and pull-ups (buy a pull-up bar). These are the best for both muscle gains and quality of life - after perfecting my form on these exercises my posture/balance/strength have never been better.<p>When you're ready for the gym, there are a number of really simple but effective routines you can follow. Don't pick one that's too complex or it'll be tough to stick to. A common routine that makes the rounds is StrongLifts 5x5: www.stronglifts.com. It worked well for me (been at it for a year), but I'm sure it's not the end-all system. Heed the warnings on the site if you do it. Do NOT attempt squats and deadlifts with serious weight until you're sure your form is excellent. Take it slow.",1312518100

Lambda functions -- which is just another name for <i>anonymous functions</i> -- are a basic element of lambda calculus, which is one of the foundations of computer science (predating electronic computers).<p>In more practical terms, you need lambdas to have closures, currying and higher-order functions in general.

I remember back before cell phones were commonplace, I could remember 3-4 phone numbers in my head (home, girlfriend, parents, local pizza places) - but now that I've become so reliant on my smartphone, I can only ever seem to remember my own number (and, I'll admit - the pizza place).<p>Does it bother me? Yeah. I talk to relatives (especially of the grand- variety) who are all ""I can still remember every phone number I've ever had"", and I get a little bit jealous. I help myself get over it by rationalizing that I have access to a lot more information a lot easier, now - so I don't need to remember as much of it.<p>Having a good memory is definitely a powerful thing - especially when you want to make a good second impression.

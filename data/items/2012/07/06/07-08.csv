4206823,comment,4203286,4203722,2,0,exDM69,,,"Calling Linux ""not mainstream"" is fair enough. Calling it ""not a success"" is downright wrong and misguided. Linux is  successful beyond the wildest dreams of anyone. No-one would have believed back in the early 1990's that an open source Unix system would one day become as big as Linux is.<p>Linux powers Google, Facebook, Twitter, and a lot many other popular web sites. Linux is used on Android and a few lesser known mobile systems. Many if not most of the supercomputers in the Top 500 list are powered by Linux.<p>Hell, measured by the number of CPU's it runs on, Linux may even be the most widely used operating system today and it's been steadily increasing. (HN: anyone have any stats on this one?)<p>Go check your facts.<p>> BTW, my favorite ""Linux is awesome"" moment? Watching an inflight system in front of my seat in a Delta flight reboot..<p>We've all seen a public display with a rebooted Linux setup or stuck in bootloader. However, Windows blue screen is a lot more common.",1341561542

Imagine instead that it's your technical cofounder, who isn't quite as well immersed in the application as you, and may not get all your code idioms, but still knows their way around a compiler, and can hack in a quick bug fix in a pinch, even if the resulting code isn't as elegant as you would have done it. They know to run the test suite, even if they don't add a new test case for the bug fix. How mad should you be then?<p>The reality is that everyone here speaks English, and if the guy is editing your copy, it means he has opinions about English, which is enough to make him ""technical"" in the sense of the previous example.

I scanned it quickly and have to say that I don't think I disagree with the recommendations of that paper.  In general terms comments should not describe the mechanics of the code ""looping through all available names"" but rather the intent ""Find the user name"".<p>That comments get out of sync with code is a fact.  That they stay out of sync is inexcusable.  What I will generally do is to fully test and debug a chunk of code and then go back and annotate.  I sometimes have a ""Go comment the code"" item in my to-do list and will spend time here and there cleaning-up and clarifying comments.  The other interesting thing that can happen when commenting this way is that you can find issues with the code or identify refactoring opportunities.<p>It's like sitting down to explain what the code is doing to another capable programmer as opposes to a 12 year old who is just starting to learn how to program.  Maybe that's the best way to put it.  What do you say to an experience programmer if you had to do a code review and explain your code?  That should go in the comments.<p>If a method or subroutine is absolutely trivial then you say ""This finds the average of the voltages across these four inputs"".<p>If, on the other hand, the routine is more complex, you have to describe the overall intent ""this calculates the values of the missing pixels"" and then dive within the module to explain some of the specific techniques being used ""Polyphase FIR filter to interpolate image data for missing color samples"" or ""Bounds-limited adder to clip FIR filter data to legal image data range"".<p>In other words, you don't explain every line of code but rather functional chunks that make it easier to navigate it and understand what is being done at a macro level and why.<p>Again, my peeve is with projects that have files upon files with not a single comment.  I don't expect a book.",1341561211

It was obviously watered down, the homeworks were very (very) easy, and I retained little or nothing of significance.<p>In contrast, the Caltech class was clearly <i>not</i> watered down, and, as the material was much more focused (with a strong theme of generalization, an idea almost entirely absent from the Stanford class, as I recall) I feel I learned far more.<p>Another big difference: the Caltech class had traditional hour-long lectures, a simple web form for submitting answers to the multiple-choice* homeworks, and a plain vBulletin forum. The lectures were live on ustream, but otherwise, no fancy infrastructure.<p>So I think that some interesting questions will come up. Do we need complex (new) platforms to deliver good classes? For me, the answer right now is no -- what clearly matters is the quality and thoughtfulness of the material and how well it is delivered. Can a topic like machine learning be taught effectively to someone who doesn't have a lot of time, or who doesn't have the appropriate background (in CS, math)? Can/should it be faked? I don't think so, but I think there are certainly nuances here.<p>* Despite being multiple-choice, the homeworks were not easy -- they typically required a lot of thought, and many required writing a lot of code from scratch.",1341561185

While many people are having a lot of success, there are also many people who struggle to find a job at all. Some businesses are desperate for talented IT workers and programmers, but many of these same businesses won't give anyone the time of day unless they have a 4-year degree, several years of paid experience in IT, and / or a bunch of IT certifications.<p>I myself have been looking for a decent entry-mid level IT job for over 8 months. I have a security clearance, 9 years of paid experience in a closely related field, 58 credit hours towards my A.S. in Computer Information Systems with a high GPA, a Security+ certificate, and 15 years of unpaid experience troubleshooting, repairing, and working with computers. I've written 50+ resumes and had them edited and critiqued by someone whose full time job is finding employment for people. When I was looking I lived in possibly the best job market in the world for cleared personnel (D.C. area) and I've applied to well over a hundred jobs, many of which I'm overqualified for. \nAll I have to show for it so far is 2 interviews at companies that offered to pay me barely enough to support my family in positions that wouldn't give me the experience I need to get the job I actually want(took one of them) and another interview with a government organization that wanted to talk to me right up until I told them that I am a reservist.<p>I think that there's a lot of people out there in a similar situation, who see value in certifications because there are businesses out there who place such an important emphasis on them. From my perspective, if I ignored certifications that employers are looking for, then I'm not doing everything I can to make myself more employable.",1341561008

You should be complaining about your ability to think up interesting problems and interesting solutions to solve them.<p>.<p>Think of programming like Legos.  The only fun way to play with Legos is to pick an awesome thing to make beforehand (Say a 3 foot tall T-Rex) then figure out how to put random pieces together until you have what you had in mind.  It doesn't matter you don't know fluid dynamics, rigid body  mechanics, or structural engineering.  You don't need a physics degree from MIT to make something interesting in Legos.  In fact, the only real thing that really matters is your ability to pick something amazing to make.   You <i>will</i> learn how to make it if you have sufficient motivation.  You will get motivated because what you're about to make is incredibly exciting.<p>Say there was an amateur who managed to make a 3 foot tall T-Rex vs. a mechanical engineer who made a 10-inch high structurally sound lego table.  An audience sudden enters and they immediately warm around the T-Rex.  ""But, but,"" protests the mechanical engineer, ""my chair is built with industry best practices.  Look at that T-Rex!  It's a mish-mash of random structure.  No self-respecting engineer would be seen next to that thing.""  The audience doesn't care.  The T-Rex is cool.  The T-Rex is interesting.

The mechanical engineer chose to build something stuffy and boring.

There is only one out of a million who trains up his ability to think of something crazy new and interesting to build.<p>.<p>A personal story:<p>I went to MIT and I still didn't know how to do MVC in php properly until my senior year.  What I did know how to do was pick a fun problem then bash my head against it repeatedly until it worked.  I would spend hours perusing through the docs and obscure questions on bulletin boards until I found a code snippet that did what I wanted.  Even then, I didn't always know how the code snippet worked.  I just pasted it in and prayed to god it worked.  Sometimes it did, most times it didn't.  When it didn't, I fiddled around with the variables until somehow, somehow I made it work.  And boy, that felt great!<p>If a semi-decent programmer had looked at my code, he would've gouged his eyes out.  The redeeming factor to all my franken-code was the fact that if I did manage to get everything functional at the end, it was always a fun result.  Because it was fun, I did side project after side project.   It was an addictive cycle -- with the new skills I picked up, I could envision even more fun projects.  During the process, I learned about php, MVC, mySQL, then rapidly accelerated through to Android, ObjectiveC, Flash, HTML5, RabbitMQ, Node, and Redis.<p>.<p><i>Jiggity's Guide to Become a Rockstar Startup Founder</i><p>1.

This is about their inner workings and the reasoning behind some of the decisions or techniques being made.<p>You talk about over-commenting.  I am talking about no comments whatsoever, not even to document methods or subroutines.  I cloned this one project that was loaded with methods not used anywhere.  In fact, it had included the SBJson framework and it was being used in a method that never got called.  The issue came up because it collided with my own use of SBJson on my project and I wanted to figure out what to do about it.  It turns out that I could just delete the entire thing and it did not affect the code at all.<p>I'll give you another example.  I have not programmed in Forth in a long time.  Maybe fifteen years.  However, I do have tons of Forth code that I wrote back then for various projects.  All of it is very well documented.  I have no doubt that, fifteen years later, I could grab that code and be back in the swing of things in no time at all.  I wouldn't have to read through the code in detail and go through the process of building stack images in my head to figure out what is going on.  Without comments code libraries like that become impenetrable black boxes.<p>I could say the same about LISP.  I haven't touched it in ages.  I wrote tons of utilities and at least one major framework (one year dev time) for a variant called AutoLISP (runs inside AutoCAD).  Again, tons of comments which would allow me to jump right in and know exactly what is going on.<p>It should go without saying that trivial stuff does not require comments. As an hypothetical example, a loop that searches an array (or whatever) for a specific match doesn't need line-by-line comments.  What I might do here is, again, hypothetical, just before the ""for"" statement throw-in a comment that says something like ""Look for CRC code match in packet data"".  With that simple line anyone reading the code knows what the intent was.  I can read that code five years later and know exactly what it does without having to read backwards and forwards through the code to figure out what each variable might be, where they come from, what they are loaded with, what the intent might be, etc.<p>I also find it invaluable to document state machines (particularly for hardware --FPGA-- designs).  If you take something like a custom DDR3 SDRAM controller state machine, well, it isn't a trivial thing to read through and figure out what it is doing.  Well-authored comments can turn something that would take hours-upon-hours to comprehend into an easy read.<p>I have seen the value of good comments and code documentation many times over during my career.  Keep in mind that I am not making a comparison between sparse comments and writing a book.",1341559791

Most people seem to forget that the original intent for <i>all</i> ""IP-laws"" originally was to broaden the public knowledge and to ultimately benefit the public.<p>That private entities was incentivized with limited monopolies which they could use to profit was merely a means, not the goal. These days everyone takes for granted that the means is the goal and the original goal is long forgotten.<p>If the original intent hadn't been forgotten as well as it has at this point, I doubt we would have seen the massive expanse of ""IP-laws"" which we have seen these last decades. Heck, back in the days there was no such thing as ""IP"". People were rational enough to realize there is no such thing as ""intellectual property"" which you can possess in a meaningful way.<p>Copyright law, patent-law and all these ""IP-laws"" should be reverted back to their original intent. Unfortunately that is not going to happen.<p>The US has way too much invested in so called ""intellectual property"" to go back on this now. Look at the US these days. What brings in the money? Traditional industry? All gone. Manufacturing? All outsourced.<p>In fact all the US has left of value is ""intellectual property"". Think Microsoft, Apple, Google and Hollywood. Now imagine the current US without the likes of those, or a world where their ""property"" could be had by anyone at no cost. Where would the US be then?<p>For all the bad things IP laws brings about (and don't get me wrong, I do think they are bad) there is a reason the US (and mostly the US) is pushing so hard on copyright-law and patent-law and trying to divert us from their original intent by instilling the idea of ""intellectual property"" as a legitimate one in the public mind.<p>Right now, this so called ""intellectual property"" is the only thing the US have left.",1341558644

If the story needs fit, wiggle, adjustment, then it's either not really done, or you raise the changes as another story for the next sprint.<p>2. Done is done - it's a binary yes/no thing.

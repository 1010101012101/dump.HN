8381016,comment,8380781,8380896,1,0,Retric,,,"IMO, there is a lot more you can do when designing infrastructure from the ground up.  Near me there is an underground mall connecting around 30 buildings.  While limited, the advantage of separating foot traffic from road traffic is huge.  It&#x27;s all built down one street, but expand that in two directions and you can easily have a few hundred buildings within walking distance of each other.  Which is not only efficient, but actually promotes walking around.  No need to worry about heat or inclement weather.  Add a subway for longer distance trips and cars become far more optional.<p>Baltimore has a raise sidewalk covering a few blocks which also provides significant benefits as it&#x27;s a high foot traffic area.  However as it&#x27;s exposed to the elements and does not add space for shops. So, I suspect it&#x27;s going to be more costly to maintain long term.<p>Other options: Moving sidewalks are unfortunately energy hogs and limited to fairly low speeds. But, I suspect some raised bike lanes separated from foot and road traffic could move a lot of people at fairly low costs.  The advantage over bike lanes is safety and they don&#x27;t reduce density.  Which of course opens the door to other forms of personal rapid transit.  The important bit IMO is even 20 MPH can cover a lot of ground if your not stuck in stop and go or deal with pedestrians.",1411941305

The Plan 9 team was initially led by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, Dave Presotto and Phil Winterbottom, with support from Dennis Ritchie as head of the Computing Techniques Research Department.

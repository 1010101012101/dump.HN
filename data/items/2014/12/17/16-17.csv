You can control nearly everything from the keyboard. It&#x27;s very quick and easy to set up side-by-side windows (or side/top-bottom, and so on), and resizing one automatically resizes the other. It really helps on smaller screens, since by default everything is full screen with minimal window decoration.<p>Some nice features of i3wm in particular - well developed manual control, most layouts can be expressed as the composition of simpler layouts, and the config file is just a config file, not a full fledged program.<p>Also, it&#x27;s worth remembering that on Linux you can have multiple WMs installed at the same time. You can log in to i3wm, and if there&#x27;s something you really can&#x27;t figure out, you can log out and switch to gnome/kde/etc. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a way to switch WMs without shutting down the whole x session though.

8762977,comment,8756710,8760254,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"If the Constitution is just an enabling document, rather than a limiting one, what do we use all the men with guns for, and how did governments without foundation law function before it was written?<p>In Anglo-American legal tradition, an explicit enumeration of included elements is an implicit exclusion of anything else.  This is contrary to common sense, where if you say my grocery purchase includes apples and oranges, you might also be buying bread.  Not so in law.  If you write a list that includes apples and oranges, there is nothing else; that is the entirety of the list.<p>When the Constitution explicitly enumerates the powers of the government, it is saying that <i>these things are the only things this government is allowed to do</i>.  In practice, the government found the vaguest and broadest enumerated power, and cites it as its justification for everything else that it does.<p>With the Bill of Rights, the 9th and 10th were inserted to allay those fears.  Read the 9th again: <i>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</i>  That is an explicit reversal of the general legal principle that an enumeration is a complete list.  Otherwise, it would indeed mean that the people have no other rights beyond what were enumerated.<p>So it is both enabling and limiting.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  But as the 9th amendment shows, there was a default assumption in place that requires the 9th to be inserted to explicitly contradict.  Those people that argue that it is an exhaustive enumeration are most likely correct.  But de jure and de facto exercises of power are sometimes different.<p>If you enumerate a power that says &quot;...and anything else the Congress decides to do&quot;, then there is no limitation.  The government doesn&#x27;t even need to bother with the enumerated powers.  Just throw everything into the catchall clause, even if it could be justified elsewhere, just to save time.  And that&#x27;s what the interstate commerce clause has become.  An overly broad interpretation of that one power renders the remainder of the document largely irrelevant.<p>That&#x27;s why the Bill of Rights was necessary.  The Antifederalists thought (correctly) that the federal government would grow well beyond its initial limitations.  Madison was aware of their arguments, so in addition to the whitelist of enumerated powers, there had to also be a blacklist of enumerated prohibitions.  And it had an explicit declaration of &quot;plus other stuff we didn&#x27;t explicitly list here&quot;.<p>It should be a stark contrast.  The main body of the document was written by and for optimistic Federalists.  The Bill of Rights was written as a failsafe mechanism to address the concerns of the Anti-Federalist opposition, for when the original document inevitably failed to contain the unrestrained exercise of government power.  Some people predicted before the thing was even signed that it would fail at its weakest point, which just happened to be the interstate commerce clause (but if it wasn&#x27;t that, it would have just been something else).<p>The fact that we are now operating largely on the failsafe backup mechanism is a concern.  We have no backup for the backup.  The smart thing to do, rather than argue about the right to bear arms for illegal immigrants, is to patch the original point of failure.  Fix the interstate commerce clause to make it more painful to use as a catchall, or repeal it entirely.",1418835222

8762953,comment,8762493,8762729,0,0,HillRat,,,"Fixed-distribution stack ranking is bad for precisely the reason pointed out -- because of differences between team missions, personnel, and capabilities, the values are basically scale-free when compared across an organization. It also means that employees, particularly at the upper management level, are graded relative to factors that are exogenous to their performance (if you do a great job running a declining or static business unit, you&#x27;re likely to take a hit relative to an executive doing a worse job in a better sector).<p>Rank-and-yank arguably worked well at GE because Welch was dealing with a large, unwieldy, and poor-performing conglomerate that had a lot of room for workforce reduction. But as the company got leaner and more effective, it got rid of the practice, and it&#x27;s unclear why tech companies -- which one assumes haven&#x27;t had time to get lazy and complacent -- jumped on the bandwagon.<p>In fact, theoretically, if you&#x27;re constantly cutting the bottom 10-20% of performers, and the quality distribution of new hires remains constant, at some point you should have pulled up the overall quality of the organization. The fact that you can&#x27;t create a perfect organization by constantly cutting the lowest quantiles suggests that either something&#x27;s wrong with the ranking systems used (which there is!), or that the practice has deleterious effects on retention, behavior, and morale (which it does!).<p>Practically, this means that, as a manager, you get really good at piling up deadwood until the order comes down to swing the axe -- far easier to keep a few window-seat employees around to satisfy the Layoff Gods than to go to war every time you do your QPRs. You might also coordinate with lateral colleagues to move good employees around so you can keep them in the game.",1418835051

Figured out how to get it under test, when bugs are fixed they get tested. Every once in awhile I&#x27;d grab the most important piece of the project and put it under test.<p>Gave up after awhile. It&#x27;s a poor use of time. The app&#x27;s been maintained for years, its failure modes are well-understood. It&#x27;s stable. There are other parts of the infrastructure that need attention.<p>I managed to convince my superiors that now&#x27;s the time to replace it. Rather than devote countless hours to this time sink, I decided to stop adding to the legacy app, cordoned it off and now treat it like a Superfund site. I replaced my work machine a while back, I keep the old machine around because it&#x27;s the only thing I can work on it with. I feel like I&#x27;m putting an environmental suit and gloves on every time I open it up. All new functionality is built outside the app and interacts with it as if it were a black box.<p>We now have an agenda and a plan to replace it. And the projects I&#x27;m working on now will bring a lot more value and capability. We even got them to expand my department.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that organizational problems shouldn&#x27;t be treated like technical problems. A large, untested, legacy application that a lot of business is riding on is an organizational problem and not a technical one. They decided not to devote the resources to properly maintain it, you need to put forth the case that it&#x27;s a serious problem and that it needs more than your efforts to fix. That&#x27;s how organizational problems are solved, one person takes the initiative and gets people behind him and makes it happen. Not by being a cowboy.<p>Trying to take code that was written in one era, and bring it into another era is a huge waste of time and resources. Figure out what you need to really solve the problem and ask for the resources to do so, after you&#x27;ve gotten your ducks in a row and at least made efforts to do it other ways.

At the other end of the spectrum, if Dissent is deployed in a completely open setting that allows anyone to join at any time with no barrier to entry at all, then any user will be able to create sybils or sockpuppets just by joining multiple times, and Dissent offers no sockpuppet protection - but neither would a non-anonymous group communication protocol.<p>More realistically, groups might operate at intermediate levels of openness with different sybil/sockpuppet protection tradeoffs, and Dissent preserves whatever protection that group management mechanism provides.  For example, a group might require users to deposit a bitcoin in an escrow account on joining, which they would forfeit if the group later votes that the user is misbehaving and should be banned.

That is bad for an economy, the belief that only through constant growth can the economy work.

8762724,comment,8759291,8760971,0,0,tommorris,,,"DBpedia is data scraped out of Wikipedia and made available as RDF, SPARQL (and JSON). The scraping process is... okay. Sometimes it is great, sometimes it is really crappy.<p>Wikidata is intended to be the database behind Wikipedia. The current infoboxes that show you things like the population of cities—ideally, they&#x27;ll be driven at some point directly from Wikidata. Then Wikidata can be a place for disparate data to be placed, often directly from government and other official data sources. The US government census data would just be routinely imported into Wikidata, and then the Wikipedia infoboxes would be driven from that.<p>It may also at some point lead to the creation of an alternative to the current category system on Wikipedia. Wikipedia currently has policies around categorisation of people. For instance, we might have a category called &quot;British physicists&quot;, and a category called &quot;Jewish physicists&quot; and a category called &quot;LGBT physicists&quot; but because it would be too difficult to maintain, Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;British Jewish LGBT physicists&quot; category. See <a href=""http://enwp.org/WP:OVERCAT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://enwp.org/WP:OVERCAT</a><p>What Wikidata means is we might be able to get rid of the category system, or rather have a category system where the categories are based on Wikidata properties. So instead of having all those categories, you could have a faceted navigation system where you say &quot;Show me all the scientists, now show me all the British scientists, now show me all the physicists, now show me all the women physicists&quot; etc. etc. And you could pick any property you choose, not just the ones that Wikipedia category editors think are important.<p>This also gets rid of a whole load of politics around categories: there was a big storm a while back when someone decided to split up the &quot;American novelists&quot; category into &quot;American men novelists&quot; and &quot;American women novelists&quot;, and some of the latter decided that this was rather a demotion. Eventually, Wikidata may end up powering the replacement for that, enabling readers to find what they want without editors having to make contentious judgment calls like that.<p>Where Wikidata becomes quite interesting is that because it ends up being used by Wikipedia, there&#x27;s some kind of motivation to get it right and keep it up-to-date. It&#x27;s all too easy for projects like Freebase to import-once-and-forget. But if it is used as the basis for a public-facing project like Wikipedia, there&#x27;s hopefully some more pressure to get it right. (Obviously, how much you trust that is rather dependent on how much you trust Wikipedia to get things right.)<p>It also may end up being the centre node for pointers between databases: because Wikipedia is a reasonably good collection of everything (or, everything that a few people at some point decided to write about in a books, which is a reasonably good low barrier), then it becomes a fairly good central index for pointers to other data sources. Bibliographic/authority control databases like GND, BNB, VIAF and others are already being merged into Wikidata, as have pointers to the identifiers used in some specialist scientific databases. There&#x27;ll be plenty more where that came from.",1418832066

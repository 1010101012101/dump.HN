(We are releasing dropbox this weekend).<p>Here is our idea: there are many different cloud storage services and each of them is very good for a particular use case but not so good for other use cases. For example, Google Docs service is excellent for collaboration but not so good for storage. On the other hand, Dropbox or Sugarsync service is excellent for storage but not so for collaboration.<p>So if data is continuously synchronized between Google Docs and lets say SugarSync storage, then you can always fall back to SugarSync when Google Docs becomes unavailable and vice versa. In order words, you can use other service as a standby site in case of service unavailability, malicious or accidental deletion of files, etc.",1302814601

In English it seems that ""irony"" conveys only a rhetorical effect.<p>In Latin derived languages (Spanish, Portuguese), however, it also conveys a situation that turns out to be not what it seems at first sight; as in the Greek root eirnea (dissimulation). We call it <i>ironia del destino</i> (destiny's irony). E.g.: one would expect a site that publishes news concerned about privacy not to collect information about visitors without them knowing it.<p>But I concede that English restricts the meaning of this word.

Lately I've been using Outlook's ""Follow Up"" flag for this purpose with some success. A calendar program which showed me all of my un-followed-up e-mails, including a visual cue to remind me of how long ago it was sent, would be ideal. Also, ongoing events/projects would benefit from this style.<p>I think my ideal calendar interface would be a screen split into thirds, with the middle representing today, and the left and right sides representing the past and future, respectively, on a logarithmic scale.

In the case of Operation Flashpoint, it actually meant buying a new DVD drive that was compatible with the games copy protection as well.<p>Sorry, gamers are costumers, too. More so: they are premium customers, buying one of the most expensive entertainment products that you can get. No, I don't want to discuss this: If I bought a game and the developer takes actions that may incorrectly flag me as a pirate and then decides to _play games with me_, he is a selfish smart-ass that doesn't know a prime rule of software development: your clever scheme almost certainly has failures. Which for me as a customer means: sorry, I'm not going to buy from you again. Garry might be in the position to do so, but its still bad.<p>And if Garry wants to vent his frustration, he can do so in other ways, instead of firing a shotgun blast that may mostly hit pirates, but some if his fans as well.<p>And as shown below: there are cases where legitimate customers must work around that 'bug' to play the game.",1302813852

If it detected it was being run on a cart copier it would inject glitches at certain points that made it almost impossible to beat, including freezing the game at the beginning of the final boss fight and then erasing all the saved games. Video is below.<p>I agree with both sides on this issue. These are quite innovative techniques to protect the developer's bottom line, but they can be aggravating to some people that mistakenly end up on the wrong end of the fight. Personally, the issues you addressed, the one I mentioned and the article linked here are all common in that they are implemented in video games, which is (hopefully) only developed for entertainment purposes. I don't see much of an issue in doing so with games. Don't get me wrong, people put a lot of time and effort into playing games, myself included, and for the developer to potentially write some function that erases all my games or makes it impossibly hard to have fun using his product is mean. But, it's just a game.<p>If Microsoft was to do the same idea and erase all Word documents on my computer if it detected my copy of Office was non-genuine could potentially devastating if I didn't have backups ready. I've already been caught in their Genuine Advantage filter with a legitimate license. I'd definitely rally behind and movement to prevent office or business software from doing something like this.<p>Point being, the developer of Garrys mod is frustrated that people are taking his product illegally in order to entertain themselves. They aren't pirating the game to help cure diseases or end world hunger, they're taking it to entertain only themselves. It's just a game, and he's trying to have fun with the people that are pirating it who don't need to be using it to begin with. At least with this particular incident, false positives can be checked and remedies can be put in place for those few instances.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmyoV1bkXNI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmyoV1bkXNI</a>",1302811815

If the thumbnail you requested exists in the size you want, the information is just returned and you are not charged for the generation.  You can tell this happens by looking at the 'created' timestamp in the returned object.<p>If you request the same thumbnail twice, you will get the same one back twice; however, there is a force_new parameter that can be passed to the generate method that will force it to fetch a new version each time.<p>We do not have explicit protection right now for DoS attacks, and I thank you for raising that point.  In all honesty, the system right now is limited by our ability to handle traffic; you couldn't likely surpass a couple requests a second if you were trying, but it is something we will be thinking about moving forward.<p>I hope that answers everything for you; if you have any other questions, please let me know.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/</a>",1302811605

Recurring billing is clearly necessary and legitimate, but it's easy to abuse when there are lots of people who just aren't paying attention.

If our startup ends up going nowhere and nobody has done it by then, we will.[2] The potential is insane, IMO. It's crazy how many people we know who either <i>have</i> an iPad as their main computing device, or who would be served well by it if they didn't have to maintain a classic personal computer to back up/update the iPad.<p>[1] Syncing should still be better than the current iTunes situation if you do.<p>[2] Maybe, <i>maybe</i> we can eventually do it as a side project without losing too much focus.

Gandi and Joker are expensive, inwx is so-so and NFS is cheap but has an extremely limited selection of TLDs. NFS and Joker have terrible interfaces, Gandi's is somewhat nice, however it's just way too big, inwx's is nice (somewhat unintuitive, but fast and compact). Joker makes accidentally deleting something hard, inwx makes it way too easy. Gandi pollutes your default zone file, NFS puts a SPF record there (which I like).<p>If you've just a few .com domains and don't need a registrar outside the US, use NFS.

It certainly doesn't impair their ability to use technical measures (aka, fixing bugs) to impair your ability to jailbreak.<p>Since no one had ever been sued for jailbreaking (and similar policy was not applied to, for instance, the PS3), the practical effect of the copyright ruling was close to nil.",1302811342

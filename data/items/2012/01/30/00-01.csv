That is why people 'believed' that the sign said 'Please use other door.'<p>If you were in front of the door that is open, why say 'Please use this door.'  They will.  You don't have to say so.  People generally do not walk up to the door they do not tend to use. Hence why they assumed that the sign said 'Please use other door', since that is 1) what is most often on the doors and 2) it's illogical to have a confirmatory sign on the open door.",1327885155

It makes us feel all self-righteous to do it, but doesn't actually get to the root of the problem. Ultimately, those countries which host cheap labor and allow its exploitation are responsible for offering it. Perhaps not the true in small, powerless countries which can get pushed around by large corporations, but China certainly doesn't fall into that category.<p>If we want things to change, I think we either need to turn our eye to the Chinese government for not enacting stricter controls, or simply declare that these problems are an inevitable result of poverty and industrialization, and that the only ways out are to either return everybody to agrarian lifestyles (which is in many ways worse than working in an evil factory) or allowing these poor conditions to produce economic growth.",1327884378

3526898,comment,3525927,3526553,1,0,Jach,,,"Admittedly I skimmed the blog post but I saw a complaint against the ""Hello World"", not how to print out a string. I agree the ""System.out.print"" thing is such a non-issue. If it really bothers you, make a class in your package that's a wrapper around it so you can call Utl.print() or U.o() or however short you want to make it. Meanwhile the rest of us will get back to programming. In the few years I've done a lot of Java development it's never bothered me enough to even make a vim shortcut for it.<p>However, the ""Hello World"" criticism does make sense to me in this sense.

For [insert almost any other language (not C++)] there is considerably less. (Python is 4 facts.)

In the '90s, it was not unheard-of for programmer productivity (individually and for the group) to be measured in LoC. Java's great advantage is that it's easy to be ""productive"" (100+ LoC/day) without accomplishing or thinking very much. An actually productive day can leave behind an eye-popping 750 LoC.<p>Reading that code later is another story.<p>One language that presently surprised was Scala. I expected to hate it based on the way it was presented to me, and found most online tutorials pretty weak, but the language is really cool.

3526805,comment,3525861,3525861,8,0,driverdan,,,"Without more background info I can't give you specific recommendations but here are my general ones. Some of my recommendations are very basic with the hope they help someone so don't be insulted if you already know or understand some of this.<p>Freelancing is a Business<p>-------------------------<p>First make sure you realize you're starting a business. You may be working by yourself but you're starting a business like any other. You'll need to do accounting, marketing and sales, planning, etc. You can't sleep all day, lounge around, and expect work to get done. Make sure you're disciplined enough to do the work.<p>If you have a full time job don't quit just yet. Get a few freelance projects under your belt first. Make sure you have months of income in the bank to get you through the slow times. If you've decided to move to freelance because you lost your job think long and hard about it. Do you want to run your own business or do you just like to code? Are you prepared to chase down clients and sell your services to them?<p>Learn about billing and invoicing. Don't expect to bill 40+ hours a week, especially when you first start. There's overhead in running any business. You'll have tasks that aren't billable. Account for this.<p>You need to have people skills to run a business, especially if you haven't already established yourself. If you're not great at selling or interacting with people focus on improving these skills.<p>Build Credibility<p>-----------------<p>Your potential clients need to know you're credible. This is why many people have recommended improving your portfolio. In reality there are multiple ways to build credibility and the best one for you depends on what you do.<p>Understand your target client. You are trying to sell your services to them. You need to know what they want and need. If your client isn't technical then what good will code samples do? If your client is the CTO of a development firm how useful will a pretty website be without code?<p>In general it's a good idea to have a nice looking website with some sample work. It doesn't need to be an amazing design but make sure it doesn't look like a coder with no design skills made it. Pay someone if you have to, you want your business to look good after all.<p>The actual samples and quantity doesn't matter too much so long as it fits two criteria: it's good and it highlights what you do. If you write code have a few samples from the languages you work in. If you build basic content sites for businesses (eg CMS or ecommerce sites) put some screenshots up or link to them. If you're a designer put up some nice designs.<p>Portfolios are best for incoming leads, when potential clients come to you. They don't know who you are and are making a judgement based on your website. As I highlight below networking is a much better and more likely way for an unestablished freelancer to get work. Don't expect many (if any) people to stumble onto your portfolio and hire you from it.<p>While a portfolio style website is nice it's even better if you can establish yourself through work, video, or words. This means blogging, speaking at conferences, starting or contributing to open source projects, and hosting or organizing events related to your expertise. Establish yourself as an expert at what you do.<p>Set an hourly rate that reflects your skills and raise it over time. I recommend billing at <i>least</i> $50 per hour. Setting a higher rate actually implies credibility. That said, you'd better be able to deliver. Someone paying for your time expects to get quality work out of it.<p>You'll always have more credibility if you can meet someone in person. Which leads to networking.<p>Network, Network, Network!<p>--------------------------<p>In my opinion this is the absolute best way to get clients. Get out there and meet them in person. Reach out to people you've worked with in the past and see if they need some work done (don't steal your employer's clients though). Get on meetup.com and go to events, lots of them.<p>Don't network for just yourself, do it for others. If you run into someone who needs a designer but you write code put them in touch with a freelance designer who does good work. Help out your fellow freelancers and small business owners and they will return the favor. Even if they don't you'll be happy to know you helped a friend.<p>Try Everything<p>--------------<p>Just because people are giving you recommendations doesn't mean you can't get work elsewhere. Try everything that comes to mind.<p>Try looking through the computer gigs section of craigslist. I tried this once when I needed new clients. I emailed less than 10 people, had a few respond, and ended up with one client.<p>Get Your Hands Dirty<p>--------------------<p>Finally, be prepared to do work you hate when you first start out. You may have to accept work you don't enjoy doing to establish yourself and get experience. My first substantial freelance gig was a content site / CMS project. I hate content sites. I find them tedious and boring. I did it anyway. You have to do what you have to do.<p>Once you start getting enough work you can turn down projects you don't want to do. Find what you like, focus on that, but for now do whatever people will pay for.",1327882306

I'm not sure that was the problem, exactly, because there were some other things going on, but I was talking Adderall for almost two years, along with Wellbutrin. I quit cold-turkey and went through a long period of being almost totally exhausted both physically and mentally.<p>As I slowly recovered, I was more strict about my diet, got a lot more exercise, and started meditating. I found that vipassana-style meditation was a tremendous help.<p>This is speculation on my part, but I think that meditation really strengthens some of the areas that I'm weak in due to ADD. I think sitting still forces me to develop ""inhibition"" skills that are typically rather weak in people with ADD. Also, mindfulness develops memory skills that I've been having a lot of trouble with lately. Also, paying close attention to direct sensations and thoughts makes it a lot easier to relax, so I tend not to build up anywhere near as much stress through the day. The bottom line is that I have more energy and focus, and just seem to function a lot better when I meditate regularly.<p>I'd bet that you will get a lot of the same benefits from yoga, alone. But I'd like to suggest that you look into vipassana and see if it works well for you, too.

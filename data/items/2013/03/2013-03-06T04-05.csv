Firefox always chooses the times when I want to get something done to do the updates and so I always cancel the update (in order to do what I want). In chrome, updates happen without me noticing them which is ideal. (this also has the added benefit to devs that older versions of firefox will fall out faster and thus require less support)",1362545986

Strict TDD never says, ""those tests you wrote to test the app in the browser- those are enough; you don't need to unit test that, because you're testing all the important and edge cases we care about, even without unit tests.""

OS X machines (PPC at the time) worked nearly flawlessly.  This alone brought so many people over that it isn't even funny.<p>The weird thing is that Unix tends to be decently consistent on the CLI.

TDD is a discipline, like double-entry bookkeeping, or sterile procedure.  Like those disciplines it has aspects that are dogmatic; but that aim at a purpose.  That purpose is to help you write software fast and well.<p>To those of you who think I'm a process peddler.  You're right; I am.  I make a very good living teaching people how to do TDD.

I've worked at several over the years.  My first was in 1976; and it was very successful.  Another was in 1989, and it didn't do so well.  I've recently founded cleancoders.com a startup in video training for software developers.  The website is done entirely with TDD.

I continue to write code using TDD today.    I've seen the startup trap.  I've lived the startup trap.  I strongly advise you to avoid that trap.",1362544574

Looking at the list, the first test looks complicated. Start small or not at all. Multiplication, how hard could that be? We'll work on that one first.""<p>The examples like this that were provided were of trivial methods. Trivial can be subjective, but, to me, methods whose bodies are almost <i>always</i> 2-5 lines long, not counting calls to other trivial methods, which may account for maybe another 2-3 additional lines, are basically trivial. It's one thing when you really don't need that much code, but it's another when you have classes upon classes upon classes upon classes, etc. to do something that could be OO and be in two classes with 1/2 as many lines and still be clear.<p>""Do these steps seem small to you?

Those in the know said more like 60% was better overall but that was not really ""true TDD"". The implication of 100% ""trivial"" methods is more overhead for method calls (minor cost, depending, but can be cumulative, increase/decrease call stack size more quickly, which is inefficient), a large number of entry points (more stuff can be null/nil, cause NPE's or need checks if you don't know what is going to call it later, though that can be mitigated somewhat), and just generally too many LOC.",1362544500

I'm not even arguing that TDD is a bad practice or that testing doesn't lead to better code.

When I started developing the first version, I obsessively wrote tests. That lasted about two weeks before I deleted the entire battery.<p>Now, I believe that testing helps create good software. So why would I trash the tests? Because it was a bootstrapped startup. We had <i>no revenue</i> coming in and I was burning through the small amount of money we had in the bank. We hadn't launched our product yet. We weren't even sure anyone would give a shit once we did launch.

Especially in a small startup, the stresses the team feels are well beyond what most employees are used to and there have been several accounts of the impact of that depression.[1] [2] Teaching employees effective strategies to deal with stress or even just to talk through and help manage other mental factors in their lives seems like a logical choice for success, but again I have never heard of it and would love to hear more.<p>[1]<a href=""http://bubs.co/if-you-ever-feel-alone-in-this"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bubs.co/if-you-ever-feel-alone-in-this</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://blog.launch.co/blog/should-we-talk-about-the-fact-that-jody-sherman-didnt-just-d.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.launch.co/blog/should-we-talk-about-the-fact-tha...</a>",1362543760

Previously, every article in every version of Wikipedia had a long list of links to every other version of that article, maintained by a small army of flaky bots that clogged up edit histories and often stepped on each others' toes.  Now, there's a single Wikidata node that has the single mapping of what article corresponds to what, reflected across all Wikipedia versions.  Here's ""Tokyo"" now:<p><a href=""http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1490"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1490</a><p>And here's what it replaces, repeated dozens of times in every language:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokyo&diff=539264613&oldid=539032776"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tokyo&diff=539...</a><p>The next step will be infoboxes.

1) Deferral of fees.  There are some reasonable arguments that this can actually be counter to your best interests, but if you're bootstrapping and don't have a big nest egg in the bank, it's hard to choose someone who doesn't
2) Affordable rates.  Because even if fees are deferred, you will ultimately have to pay them
3) Relevant expertise.  I would argue that this has more to do with startups similar to you (e.g. in your industry) than it does with a particular domain like corporate law or IP.  He or she should obviously be able to serve you in diverse areas, or introduce you to the right people who will

Having a clean well-factored codebase makes changes cheaper, which means your company will have lower overhead and be more responsive to market demands.<p>As far as ""forcing you to build loosely coupled code"", good TDD should involve a thin layer of integration tests (Selenium/Capybara/Whatever), which drive out unit tests for the individual components.  If you let the tests drive your code design, and follow the ""Red -> Green -> Refactor"" workflow, it tends to shepherd you into writing small easily testable functions and objects that are loosely coupled.<p>You can also use TDD to salvage crappy code, and derive good design even after the damage has been done.

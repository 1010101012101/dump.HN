5389392,comment,5388630,5389158,3,0,etherael,,,"Potentially, but if you're dismissing free markets on account of manipulative, deceitful or otherwise fraudulent behaviour, you ought to at least hope that fraudulent behaviour never occurs or occurs less frequently in the centrally planned economy alternative. There seems to be a surfeit of evidence contrary to this statement throughout the world at the moment, so you'll excuse me if I take that idea with several solar masses of sodium chloride.<p>I still maintain the only alternative to giving people what they want is forcing them to follow your plan. Historically people who take this path frequently turned out to be wrong, and all the people who they dragged kicking and screaming with them down the path end up bearing the brunt of the negative externalities for their poor decisions.<p>At least if you give people the absolute freedom to make their own choices when or if they end making bad ones they have only themselves to hold responsible. This is what annoys me most about this whole central economic planning groupthink people are prone to indulging in. The constant pretense that it's some well known scientific fact that only ignorant hicks aren't aware of on a level similar to evolution vs creationism with their ensuing, tired middle-brow dismissals.",1363532340

Even though the deal is probably exactly the same as with Windows and laptop manufacturers - car makers probably buy tires of a specific brand a large discount, so a car with tires and without them would cost roughly the same. Yet I don't see people complaining that when buying a car they don't get to choose the brand of the tires,of the wipers or of the stereo. A car is sold as a complete package.

I used to live in a market where developers are in demand (Austin) and now I don't (Omaha). Guess what? My rates have gone up recently.<p>2) I would use google to search for ""[US tech city] web designer"" and browse portfolios online. Where [US tech city] is SF, Austin, Boston, NYC, Denver, LA, Portland, Seattle - it really doesn't matter - just pick a big city starting with the above.<p>I know some folks who have had some unbelievably good luck (repeatedly) using Odesk, even with US based designers. $300 for a website design kind of luck. There is a bit of a hassle in finding the good, cheap designers, but at $300, you can afford to miss a few times.<p>3) In my experience designers are all over the map in terms of rate, and rate is not a good indicator of quality. I've seen decent work from $25-125/hour or more, while most seem to settle around $85/hour. Don't be afraid of fixed price. It <i>may</i> cost more, but at least you know. Typically, it seems a basic web design - an overall theme (3 to 4 pages) will cost between $1,000 and $3,000.<p>4) Do not hire an agency. They are one of two things - a) very expensive b) very expensive and very bad.<p>The bottom line is to ask around for referrals, and review their work. I've yet to meet a designer who can come up with a wide variety of styles that look good. Usually, their work has a distinct feel to it (like an artist) and you're going to be stuck with that, so you better do your homework and like it.<p>And finally, my email is in my profile - I can recommend a good one in Austin.",1363531578

Unless I do something worthy of government attention I have reason to believe no human is going to closely examine my gmail - why on earth would they?<p>Therefore the only breach of privacy is by a parser collecting information for an algorithm. So I get a few ads in gmail ... 90% of the time I ignore them ... the other 10%  of the time I would MUCH rather they were targeted at my interests than just meaningless drivel! Furthermore - if the ad revenue collected by these companies allows them to continue to improve a free service I love then power to them! People bitch about ads, without considering the reality that without them most of the service we value which make up the internet would not exist without them. You can't always have your cake and eat it.<p>Lastly I would like to address the point of privacy invasion by a government body. This is nothing new! It has just become easier. I live in the UK - a tiny island with 4,000,000 CCTV cameras. There is probably an accumulation of hundreds of hours of footage of me throughout my life... So What ?! I have done nothing wrong, and if the existence of that footage allows the prevention or solving of even one crime then I'm all for it.<p>If a government body wants your data - the chances are they are going to get it. Through warrant or some other means. The acceleration of this process is not necessarily a bad thing. They are, after all, the elected officials.<p>Anyway /rant (... runs and hides)",1363531318

It seems to be more of a cursed Monopoly than anything else which is why USPS is now aggressively pursing the package delivery business. I think the post office is doing a great job with innovating and outsourcing some of their business to private sector companies. For brick and mortar's they've become much better in offering opportunities such as UPS and FedEx franchise stores. They now have computer kiosks at most post offices allowing you to easily print labels and ship a package. They've teamed up with many online postage vendors such as mail.com and endicia.com. A big part of eBay's business and ecommerce in general for small items comes from USPS flat rate shipments which tend to be a substantial discount in comparison to UPS or FedEx. Even if money is lost in order to continue first-class, it's still a necessity. In total, people are not ready to go completely paperless anytime soon. By the time that happens I see USPS being just as robust if not more so than the private sector carriers. I'm a major advocate for private sector business as its nature is to turn a profit thus requiring innovation and motivation to do so but these days it seems that gov. sector entities are getting smarter by allowing partnerships with private sector entities.

Me always thought that Google was 'better' than, say, Microsoft and if google were to become just another 'evil' organisation, that would be troubling.\nSo here is my take. The key word for me is organisation, not profit. Anybody who has been working for a big organisation for a while knows how dysfunctional and political they can be. Completely distracted from whatever 'official' goal they have, profit or not. There seems to be a natural live cycle to any organisation. Grandiosely, call it the Rome Syndrome. Start from honest and humble yet promising beginnings, growth and consolidation, peak power, decay and death. Some companies survive but get hollowed out and survive only in name (e.g. IBM).<p>In light of this, in order to not become 'evil', google has to work on its organisation. And they do, Rubin's and Huber's exit, spring cleaning etc.. Also, all the smart technology google has could allow them to avoid bloated bureaucracies, hence not becoming evil.<p>But they are no Uber-humans. So let's see.<p>Firebrand",1363530052

The reasoning is that this underlines basic choices about who is taking risk; equity investors have the most risk capital, bondholders are right behind them (based on the structure of the bond) and depositors are the lowest; philosophically this is because as an investor in equity/debt it's your job to evaluate the bank's chances of failure.

This javascript is invalid CoffeeScript:<p><pre><code>    var isLargerThanSix = x > 6 ? true : false</code></pre>",1363528902

In the job market most people participate in, there aren&#x27;t a whole lot of jobs to go around, at the moment. This means that participants don&#x27;t have the luxury of having so many opportunities thrown at them that they can afford to pick and choose between them, or to walk away from one just because a place they &quot;love and believe in&quot; more might come along tomorrow. Walking away from a paying job could mean weeks or months or even years of unemployment. Not &quot;funemployment,&quot; but the <i>real</i> kind, where you lose sleep at night wondering how you&#x27;re going to make next month&#x27;s rent.<p>In that kind of environment, you can&#x27;t blame people for taking a paying job when one is offered to them.

Customer service roles are almost always non-exempt, and non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay. Given that the author wrote she was offered a $35,000 salary and made no mention of overtime pay, it sounds like there might be a misclassification issue here. These misclassifications can be very, very costly (unpaid overtime plus interest, numerous statutory penalties, attorney&#x27;s fees, etc.) so they&#x27;re incredibly attractive to plaintiff&#x27;s attorneys.<p>> “Service provider” was a pleasant euphemism for Handybook’s fleet of freelance cleaners and handymen.

Before a phone screen, send several real problems you&#x27;ve encountered and have the candidate write what they would respond, these can be happy and unhappy customers, and they should be answerable without any special knowledge of the company, or with resources available to them (a FAQ page etc...)<p>Answers should be empathetic, recognize the emotion/state of the person on the other end and attempt to be responsive and human, and apologetic if necessary. Ideally, provide at least one actual response so the candidate can get an idea of what your company&#x27;s tone is. Some favor long, descriptive answers, others go for short, direct answers. It highly depends on your customers.<p>2. On the phone, do a live writing exercise (like live coding) see how they respond to a question and how they write while being observed. If your service/support is primarily over the phone, replace writing with a simulated phone call from a customer.<p>This is mainly to see if they can write ad-hoc, this doesn&#x27;t even need to be a specific support/service question, it could be something like, write in as much detail as possible about the last amazing meal you had. A lot of support/service is being able to respond quickly and descriptively, and having good communication skills.<p>3. Onsite, you guessed it, more writing. If you have a technical product, you can add some more technical things here that may involve interacting with your product/internal tools. Have them debug something that actually has happened in the past, or a common issue that your customers run into.<p>This can be guided, you should help them along if they need it, similar to a complex programming problem, course correct and see how they respond to guidance.",1413923236

It is the same word given a second meaning. Languages aren&#x27;t separate entities, they are intertwined and defined by the speakers. In that sense you are right, a word should mean whatever it is intended to mean.<p>Still, it&#x27;s a loanword and that implies a certain responsibility for the user, as with any loan.

Simplification might have merit, but I&#x27;m all for generalization.<p>>You can certainly regret what you did not cause. You can express sympathy for what you did not cause. I think an apology is necessarily an expression of regret for something you had a role in, however. The word &quot;sorry&quot; expresses regret, but that regret is only part of an apology when there is some level of culpability.\nApologizing on behalf of someone you&#x27;ve been associating with for a long while is regret that your impact did not lead to better behavior from them. Apologizing on behalf of someone you&#x27;ve just met seems weird to me. Apologizing for things done before you were born, even weirder.<p>What&#x27;s the reverse of the euphemism treadmill? Apology is suffering it. A proper apology would explain all the reasons for the laws, which are by the way still in action. The focus shouldn&#x27;t be on acknowledgment, but on correcting the understanding of the situation, to ease any confusion.\nTo my understanding<p>>As I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, that doesn&#x27;t mean I have a strong opposition to people doing or saying weird things - I just think we should try and be clear in our thinking.<p>Exactly.<p>Therefore words heavily rely on context and the context here was clear.

Some of your criticisms point out things which exist mainly because the piece was originally written for a class assignment. e.g. Digital audio was not covered in the course, so I added some information in order to better provide background for the detection theory stuff, which <i>was</i> in the class (and also to make the article more self-contained for the reader unfamiliar with that material). Naturally there is nothing groundbreaking in that summary, but I thought I did a decent job of helping the reader with the legwork of understanding the principles. Additionally, the references are in APA format which was required for the class but, as you point out, is not ideal for the web. I will likely tweak the web version when I have a chance so it&#x27;s a little more easily navigable.<p>The fact that the residual spectrum is uninteresting I totally acknowledge; that was admittedly an afterthought. I&#x27;m going to check out your hydrogenaudio link for details on how to better that section/figure.<p>As far as the fact that I only used MP3—that was kind of the point. I wanted to pick a seemingly low-hanging fruit so that I would have some nontrivial results to work with (i.e., cases where I could hear the difference). If I&#x27;d used high bitrate AAC and it was entirely transparent for my ears 100% of the time, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do much talk about false positives and hits and misses—talk which was ultimately the meat of the assignment, and thus of the article. The goal was, as I say in the &quot;nota bene&quot; at the top, not to say &quot;Hey, look how unreliable MP3 128 is at being transparent,&quot; but rather to use MP3 128 to demonstrate the concepts of transparency and compression perceptibility.<p>As far as converting MP3 back to a WAV for ABX playback, I hadn&#x27;t heard of that but I have to think that it would have made little to no effect for my test.

8489593,comment,8489273,8489273,0,0,codezero,,,"This is probably hard for most engineers to relate to, unless part of your role is doing support.<p>edit: when I say something is not insane or unexpected, I mean it in the context of a person looking for work in customer support. These are the things you run in to. So if you are shocked that they have to provide their own hardware, then you are shocked at the way support people are often actually treated. I&#x27;m not advocating for or supporting that.<p>The interview process and criteria for being hired have really high variance compared to engineering interviews.<p>The author of this piece made the classic, and often unavoidable mistake of being between a rock and a hard place and not vetting the company she interviewed at and ultimately worked for for a day.<p>Even if you&#x27;re not an engineer/designer/data scientist (or one of the typically highly desired people for a startup), you should be working at places you love and believe in, when you&#x27;re not, you end up having bad experiences and those bad experiences are amplified by the environment.<p>First, I didn&#x27;t find Ajay&#x27;s interview to be that weird, saying why you came up with the idea for your company and your qualifications should be expected, not interpreted as a way for the founder to diminish the potential future employee. If you don&#x27;t believe in your leaders, and don&#x27;t trust them, you are in a lot of trouble.<p>edit: I think that not having interviewed with the actual support team members is a huge red flag here as well, but owing to the author&#x27;s somewhat desperate situation, they moved forward anyways.<p>12 hour days is insane, and wrong. Having to provide your own device is not really that insane for small teams. Obviously it&#x27;s great if a company provides it, and probably larger companies should always provide a workstation, but this doesn&#x27;t come across as totally abnormal. The constant &quot;want to hear a joke&quot; and racist/sexist tone at the company is also not acceptable, but clearly was supported by the people working there at the time, if the anecdote is taken at face value.<p>It&#x27;s super easy to pay for a trial period, and as far as I&#x27;m aware, it&#x27;s not even legal to have people work for free unless you are a nonprofit or government organization, so that&#x27;s shady, even if only for one day. I&#x27;ve done two week trials that were fully paid, and it was a great way to get a feel for the company and vice versa.<p>Not having any onboarding, given that the trial was for a day isn&#x27;t too surprising, but that is clearly a problem with a one day trial. They should have absolutely been given some lead-in material to help them get prepped before starting.<p>There appear to be a lot of growing pains at Handy, which isn&#x27;t a surprise, but hopefully they can move fast and get their support/service wing to be as tight and focused as the rest of their team (assuming that is true).",1413922107

2021406,comment,2020213,2020213,0,0,tate87,,,"It seems that describing yourself as a mathematician or calling something you have written for a mathematical paper is becoming increasingly popular.<p>A math paper is something that has been published in a peer-reviewed math journal. Calling a set of notes that could have been written by a high school student for a math paper is just silly.<p>Three times in the last four months I have had conversations where someone calling themselves for mathematicians turned out to think that having majored in math and now doing stats, programming, or teaching calculus makes you a mathematician.<p>Next time I apply for a position I think I'll consider adding ""chef"" to my CV. After all, I have been cooking regularly for years !",1292748770

Kids are still planning to go to colleges next fall. Hell, I'm actually thinking of doing a second undergrad at the moment! There must be startups who are making open education platforms, there must even be people who are doing it for free, that have lots of resources.<p>Lots of us are regularly reading how ridiculously expensive school is; how low the benefits are. We all feel at one time or another how inefficient the existing system is. And it's obvious that online courses using existing technology /can/ be an effective teaching tool.

So your alarm may start buzzing in the middle of ""deep"" sleep, and you get stuck with sleep inertia.<p>Smart alarms like this try to compromise by waking you up in ""light"" sleep, or ideally in moments of wakefulness that you'd otherwise pass up and go back to sleep.<p>(If you're not familiar with the concept of sleep cycles: <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sleep#Sleep_stages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sleep#Sleep_s...</a>)",1292746562

The device has no means of waking the user without a phone in bluetooth range, so what's the upshot? I don't know that battery life falls into that category because the device would need some pretty serious upgrades, and cost would obviously increase:<p>- More RAM. Lots more. Enough to contain an entire firmware image during OTA and an entire night of sleep/movement history.<p>- More MIPS. Actigraphy isn't going to be as cheap as store-and-forward.<p>- A reliable RTC so that the device can ping the phone at the <i>right</i> wakeup time.<p>- etc.<p>If I was in their position, I'd build the device to be as dumb a peripheral as possible. Push the complexity out of expensive hardware and into software. I'd also probably have built in a sweet inductive charging pad, too, but I'm a sucker for shiny things.",1292746491

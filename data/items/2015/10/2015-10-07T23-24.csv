That is, he&#x27;d assume that something he could see how to do and could execute inside of a week would be a good thesis problem to keep a Ph.D. student busy for two years.<p>As far as the 10x programmer stuff...

I think this is bunk and am quite willing to tolerate the risk that they&#x27;ll attack again, because I feel confident about my ability to repel such attacks. I have in fact knocked someone down repeatedly, let him get back up, let him attack me again, and and a third time, until he got the message and stayed down.<p>Yes, this is dangerous, but so are a lot of things. It&#x27;s dangerous in that it perpetuates a low-level danger in time, but I prefer an ongoing low-level risk to a sudden significant increase in risk. My judgments about risk in real-world situations have so far served me very well. It&#x27;s true that any given street fight could kill, but it&#x27;s also true that it probably won&#x27;t unless you&#x27;re quite unlucky, so I see no point in altering that probability if I don&#x27;t need to. This is the same reason I avoid fights in the first place and am indifferent to mere verbal abuse or bluster - it is virtually never in my interest to initiate or escalate a conflict.<p><i>Assuming the attacker is somehow nice and should be scared away is insane in that situation.</i><p>I don&#x27;t assume they&#x27;re nice, in fact I make a habit of avoiding value judgments about people because they can so easily be misleading. My experience is that many assailants are cowardly (not nice) and can in fact be scared away with minimal retaliation. It&#x27;s both risky and wasteful to inflict more harm than is required; I do not, for example, want to become the subject of a police investigation. How you got the idea that I think those who would attack someone else on the street might be nice people underneath their criminal exterior is beyond me.",1444262158

The government claimed that Keys caused $929,977.00 worth of damage. During the trial, the defense tried to cast doubt on the total damages, claiming that the expenditures in response to the hack were not reasonable, and Tribune employees had grossly inflated the hours spent on incident response.</i><p>In a previous article from VICE, it is mentioned that the defense referred to an email from Keys&#x27;s ex-boss, which suggested (to some other Tribune exec?) “If you bill a thousand dollars an hour, that will help us get it prosecuted.” [1]<p>Maybe that statement is taken out of context...because I can&#x27;t believe that the Tribune company would spend <i>less</i> than $5,000 to do an audit of their system after it got so thoroughly compromised...then again, the Tribune company is often considered to be a shitshow even compared to news organizations in general, so it wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a news executive had no fucking clue about how much damage an online hack could do.<p>The case itself is evidence of their technological savvy:<p>Exhibit A: The login credentials for a fired web producer were not revoked.<p>Exhibit B: A web producer for a Sacramento TV news website has the same privileges as a front-page web producer at the LA Times...I know the Tribune owns both news sites (as well as many others nationwide), that doesn&#x27;t mean their web producers should have universal editing privileges.<p>So I could see the damages for the incident being $5,000+ for normal security consulting fees...but $900K+?

You get to live a couple of years longer, and suffer a tiny bit less age-related disease. The cost of that is billions in research.<p>For the same amount of money, actual, serious rejuvenation of the double the remaining healthy life span following treatments type could be built in mice by following the SENS vision of repairing the cell and tissue damage that causes aging [1]. People should be chasing that dream.<p>Inside the scientific community, it is completely rational from a short term career still have a job a few years from now perspective to be investigating metabolism and the end state of a disease/old metabolism and proposing drug candidates that might slightly alter the situation for the better. That is the proven path to getting grants awarded, to moving with the grain of the system that wants drug candidates based on metabolic alteration that do a little bit of good, and no-one really cares that you&#x27;re tinkering with proximate causes, not root causes, trying to get a little bit more mileage out of a damaged engine rather than fixing the damage.<p>It&#x27;s a mess of perverse incentives. The only way to break out of the hole of misallocated funded (or at least misallocated if your goal is to effectively treat aging as a medical condition rather than, say, gain more data on the fine details of metabolism, or further your career within the system) is to bootstrap SENS therapies to the point of showing that you get far better results for far less funding, and with far less work.<p>Fortunately this is starting to happen. See, for example:<p>1) amyloid clearance: <a href=""http://www.uclb.com/news-and-events/news-post/potential-new-approach-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-amyloidosis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uclb.com/news-and-events/news-post/potential-new-...</a><p>2) senescent cell clearance: <a href=""http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2015/20150309agingcell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2015/20150309agingcell.htm...</a><p>3) mitochondrial DNA damage bypass: <a href=""http://www.gensight-biologics.com/index.php?page=mts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gensight-biologics.com/index.php?page=mts</a><p>There are others moving into startups for development; more senescent cell clearance at Oisin Biotech, clearance of metabolic waste products that contribute to atherosclerosis at Human Rejuvenation Technologies. And so on.<p>Billions have been spent on the investigation of sirtuins and other excessively hyped alleged paths to ways to slightly, slightly slow down the aging process. They have gone nowhere, produced nothing beyond more knowledge of metabolism. It is well past time to accept that that game is broken, it&#x27;s a path to nowhere other that the comprehensive mapping of cellular metabolism: very useful for the next generation of science, but not a road to extending healthy life and eliminating age-related frailty and disease. The only way to achieve that end is to repair the root causes of aging. For so long as the majority of the research community insists on metabolic tinkering that can in principle only achieve marginal results, progress to meaningful therapies will be slow.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research</a>",1444261258

I&#x27;ve known him for about 6 years. We never talked about our families, shared pictures of each-other, shared real names, or shared anything personally identifiable apart for similar interests and vague references. After about two years of talking to this friend every day, I knew a few things: his family wasn&#x27;t rich, he lived in a crime filled area Richmond, he smoked weed every day, he loves hip-hop, and he&#x27;s not a fan of school. Now, most people with their biases and stereotypes would say &quot;oh he&#x27;s probably a young black male&quot; and they&#x27;d have a good chance of being right. Around this time we all started talking about our personal lives. I then find out that this guy is a 25y/o white male studying a masters degree in physics who sports and amazing beard. My initial image of him is gone completely.<p>By anonymizing interests, beliefs, and political standings we can then apply them to anyone of any race of any gender because we don&#x27;t know the truth.

Comments could suddenly be from anyone and we are forced to pay attention to the argument and not who&#x27;s arguing.",1444259258

Like with digital photography — this is inevitable.”",1444258921

Yes, it&#x27;s a terrible website, but not for the reasons you&#x27;re insinuating. They&#x27;ve just put silly big images in. Also the reason for all the script tags is simply that they&#x27;ve not added JQuery UI properly.<p>And the problem with thisisyourkingdom seems to be a singular plugin, the wordfence plugin, which on its own is taking 8 seconds in a request which seems to be some sort of broken logging (I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to look at the code so it might be a deliberate hang to make sure the person is really a human, but it&#x27;s a terrible way of doing it).

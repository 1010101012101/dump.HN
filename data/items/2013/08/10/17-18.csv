For example, the CSS box model sounds so simple and elegant at first, but when you add dozens of styles and elements to your page, the interaction between different styles can quickly become horribly messy no matter how disciplined you are with your CSS code. Beyond a certain number of styles, CSS inheritance turns into a black art.<p>CSS simply doesn&#x27;t scale well for anything beyond relatively simple pages. A huge part of designing web pages is layout and spacing and yet positioning and spacing elements remains ridiculously messy and convoluted (even with CSS3).<p>You could also argue that tools like SASS and LESS are in effect sticking-plasters for inadequacies in CSS.<p>I know hindsight is a wonderful thing, but if we were designing CSS today from scratch, I think it would be designed very differently.",1376157434

I think this would not be possible without the modern systematic methods, including the epsilon-delta approach.<p><i>you&#x27;re also wrong about your examples. it wasn&#x27;t nowhere differentiable functions, but fourier series that motivated lebesgue. that&#x27;s what the author is referring to regarding analytical traps ie, monotone convergence.</i><p>I mentioned fourier in another comments. Those weird functions were postulated in the discussion that arised somewhere in the same time period. I don&#x27;t know what the author is referring to, because he is irritatingly vague, especially for a mathematician.<p><i>it is also quite a leap to assert the arithmetical definition of limits solves the zeno paradox!!! i few of my colleague&#x27;s might disagree with you.</i><p>If you are familiar with the concept of a limit, you can notice that Zeno considers a limiting process of two related quantities, time and the difference in the position of Achilles and the Tortoise. Since in this limiting process time get arbitrarly close to some definite value (the meeting time of Achilles and Tortoise), but never gets equal to it, it stops being so surprising that the distance between them never reaches zero, though it gets arbitrarly close. The formalism clarifies what seems parodoxical when described in natural language. I find this quite convincing, and I never found a better explanation, altough I know philosophers still dispute this.<p>I never said rigour takes precedence over intuition.

A good web designer understands that different browsers are going to have different capabilities, and build graceful degradation into the design. A good web designer knows that screens come in all shapes and sizes, and will avoid raster graphics and px-units wherever possible.<p>CSS, from my experience, makes it very easy to do web design the right way and very hard to do it any other way. It&#x27;s just that the right way is often a little different from what people expect. If you accept that <i>the browser is the boss</i>, you&#x27;ll be a lot happier, and incidentally your users will be a lot happier as well. The trouble is people coming from other platforms or mediums often expect 100% control, and for that it really doesn&#x27;t hold your hand.",1376156819

For instance, by typing &quot;replace&quot;, I just learned of query-replace, which prompts you before each substitution for a string.

In vim, all text has to be the same size and all text has to be the same font. In emacs, you can even (with some hacking, as I remember) have different color themes for different windows/views.<p>If I&#x27;m looking at an editor all day long, I want it to look pleasant. Period. Have a look at <a href=""https://github.com/jasonm23/emacs-soothe-theme"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jasonm23/emacs-soothe-theme</a> to see how beautiful it can look.<p>Apart from that, the other reason why I&#x27;m trying to switch is that I wanted to become better at lisp and I really wanted to have an editor that I can shape like a tool to suit my needs. And I could never get the hang of vimscript. So if I already learn a new language Lisp sounds like a better investment than vimscript.<p>So far, I&#x27;m happy with emacs, though I can&#x27;t use it for all my coding yet. Most notably, it lacks a good Objective-C code completion. On vim, there&#x27;s YouCompleteMe, which does a formidable job of connecting with clang complete. I started porting youcomplete me over to emacs a couple of weeks ago but had to stop due to other priorities. I&#x27;m at a point now where I can get the correct completions in emacs in a popup when I&#x27;m over a symbol or at the end of a property (self.???). However, I still have to solve a couple of issues and it is not ready for usage yet which is why I&#x27;ve never shared it. If somebody knows a bit of emacs lisp, python, and objective-c and wants to help out here, I&#x27;d be glad to share this project on Github.",1376155828

The small key size was later discovered to be right around the actual security level the cipher provides (larger key sizes would not have improved security by much).<p>In the case of public key crypto, one of the most important things we need is to know what parameter sizes to use.

On the other hand the NSA also wants to ensure that foreign governments cannot spy on American government communications.

One of the questions was &quot;here&#x27;s a button here that if pressed, would kill a very rich Chinese person. Upon her death, you would inherit all of her wealth. You don&#x27;t know this person and you will never be associated with her death. Will you press the button?&quot;<p>At the time it was an entirely rhetorical question, and yet it generated a lot of debate and moral questioning.<p>Today the question isn&#x27;t rhetorical anymore (and &quot;wealth&quot; has been replaced by &quot;a mild and temporary sentiment of increased security&quot;) and yet the moral debate has all but evaporated.<p>How we allow ourselves to feel morally superior to 18th century aristocrats is beyond me.",1376154272

I don&#x27;t have time now to work through all the details, but my gut feeling is that for log(n) selection of bases, at least one will work for the calculation you need to perform.  But I am not an expert, so my intuition is not to be trusted.<p>But these very simple calculations show that in at least some cases, being able to compute unrestricted discrete logs will break RSA, perhaps just not in general.  Perhaps it&#x27;s another case where the modulus and exponent need to have extra conditions.<p><i>Added in edit. Again.</i><p><pre><code>  > ... you could only recover the message M\n  > if you have M = b^x (mod n).\n</code></pre>\nWe know that that equation has a solution, because M=E^d (mod n) where <i>d</i> is the private key.<p><pre><code>  > ... what base do you compute the logs when you\n  > do this attack?\n</code></pre>\nThat would suggest we compute logs base E.  Reworking the sums, and specifically using logs base E:<p><pre><code>    E = M^e (mod n)\n    log_E(E) = e.log_E(M)\n    log_E(E)/e = log_E(M)\n    1 / e = log_E(M)\n    E^(1/e) = E^(log_E(M)) = M\n</code></pre>\nStill just idly musing, but it seems right.",1376154066

For one, the asymmetry in risk and strength between a <i>manned</i> supersonic fighter plane armed with laser-guided missiles and unarmed person on the ground is already massive. Drones should only piss you off slightly more. Second, I don&#x27;t think the asymmetry is actually a problem; if you&#x27;ve decided to kill someone, you might as well do it by the most efficient means that pose the least risk to your personnel. In fact, if you have a really easy way to kill someone, you&#x27;d be a fool to use other means.<p>To me, the problem is <i>killing people</i>. Killing people is wrong and you shouldn&#x27;t do it.

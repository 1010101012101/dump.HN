With Chrome OS Google has proven thay think just as we do, but we aren't afraid, we know it will be a very tough fight but we aren't scared of them.<p>One of the big problems Google has is that their products aren't well linked. They offer Google+, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs... but it's like they were different products that don't work so good together (by the way, weeText works better than Google Docs).<p>Another problem about Google is privacy, if you read their terms and conditions you'll see ALL the data you upload will automatically become theirs. When talking about taking all your files to the cloud will you really upload your personal files knowing they will become property of Google?<p>Finally, Chrome Web Store only works in Google, if you want yo use all the apps available you have to use Chrome.

All you need is a settings.py file to run a Django app. The templating is slow performance-wise but pretty expressive.<p>I love that the Django community as a whole is pretty responsive to criticism. The 'Why Django Sucks' talk at DjangoCon is an example. My biggest complaint was the horrible User model (you cannot not have 'username' for a Django app using the User model). But they've fixed it now. The major complaint against Django is that it is monolithic, but the devs have worked hard to keep the system decoupled allowing one to replace most modules. But if you want something small Django is not the one for you I guess, and there is nothing wrong in it. One size fits all is never possible to achieve and not a good solution too.",1353150250

And small parties know you'd have to pay them if you want the budget passed. Between those, you have also some agenda you probably want to advance, and this requires majority too. So unless the principle of the ruling party is to make as litte laws and humanly possible - and don't get me wrong, I'd love such party, but it is very rare - they'd have to form a majority, even if temporary. And the temporary one is more dangerous because you'd have to pay each time you need it.<p>Italy is in no way unique at this, of course, there are many more countries with same problems.",1353150025

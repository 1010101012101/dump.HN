It gives no confidence when you start the article with a glaring factual error.<p>""The idea of battleships duking it out in the high seas is pretty ridiculous when you stop to think about it. It never really happened unless you count the Battle of Jutland.""<p>If you write such an article, you should do a bit of research and be at least dimly aware of the battles of Tsushima, Heligoland  Bight, Moon Sound etc. etc. etc. Battleships were indeed a bit slower, but when they showed up they instantly dominated the field with their range and firepower. Even in WW2, when the carrier greatly reduced their importance, battleships fought a few very important engagements, e.g. Denmark Strait and second battle of Guadalcanal.<p>It's easy to deride things you don't understand as ""tumescent penii"". But the historical fact is, for about half a century after 1890, battleships were indeed the most effective (and also expensive) naval weapons system in existence.",1306940394

Recrypt the now changed wallet.dat and you are good to go.<p>Once/if normal people start using bitcoin I highly doubt that they would even bother with the client (""Encrypt my what? Wallet.dat?

2607523,comment,2607243,2607452,4,0,gst,,,"I think the complicated decision here is how to classify Bitcoins:<p>If you treat Bitcoins as currency you would need to state the value of your Bitcoin income on your tax statement. However, when doing so you would need to convert the Bitcoin value to your government's local currency, so that taxes can be calculated. The problem here is that the Bitcoin market is still relatively small and that you have no guarantee that you can sell a given amount of Bitcoins at a given price. E.g., you may have earned 100.000 BTC in a given year. However, when you try to sell all of them on the Bitcoin exchange markets at the same time, it may be possible that you crash the market. So you would need to pay taxes in your governments currency for something that you cannot sell at the estimated price.<p>On the other side, you could only declare income resulting from selling Bitcoins for a ""real"" currency. However, I'm not sure if your government will allow this, as this would allow for ""creative"" tax statements. E.g., as a freelancer you could charge your clients in Bitcoins, but then only convert Bitcoins to a ""real"" currency if you need to buy something that cannot be bought for Bitcoins. So if you would have charged your client in USD, you would have had to pay a large amount of taxes in a given year. However, by using Bitcoins, you can delay the payment of those taxes.",1306940204

2607429,comment,2607262,2607262,61,0,_djo_,,,"This is not exactly convincing. Battleships, far from being a ridiculous idea, were a logical and necessary step for any navy wishing to project power at sea. They were so heavily armoured and gunned that for a long time, from the late 19th Century to just before WWII, the only realistic defence against a battleship was another battleship.<p>While the Battle of Jutland may seem silly, the alternative would have been a bunch of smaller ships duking it out (probably for a similar result) or only one side possessing battleships and annihilating the other side.<p>Manoeuvre warfare with a lighter fleet was not an option, as smaller vessels had smaller guns that frequently could not even penetrate a battleship's armour. So a battleship would've been able to pick off opponents at ease while they struggled to cause any damage. It's no good getting inside your opponent's OODA loop if you can't cause any damage.<p>And the technology that would have permitted another nation to bypass the idea of a battleship altogether and attack it from a different angle just did not exist at the time. It was only decades after Jutland that naval aircraft and aircraft carriers became fast and advanced enough to make the aerial bombing and torpedoing of enemy vessels a real possibility. These days missiles are the great equalisers.<p>Manoeuvre warfare is fantastically effective when the circumstances allow for it, but the available conditions, technology and personnel can sometimes make it ineffective. For instance, the German Blitzkrieg was extraordinarily effective against the static French defences in 1940, but the same forces and tactics came unstuck in 1941 when faced with a vicious winter and the Russian scorched earth style of defence.<p>With reference to the hacker context, the lesson is that simply moving quickly isn't enough. You also need to understand what a competitor's real weaknesses are as well as understand which parts of their strengths you're incapable of attacking. If your enemy has battleships and all you have are frigates, then maybe you shouldn't be fighting them at sea.",1306939084

Here's a little story to illustrate why patent trolling is so evil.<p>I used to work at a software company that has an incentive program for developers that come up with patentable ideas, e.g. algorithms. You get a token prize when ""your"" patent gets submitted -- a pencil or something like that, I don't remember anymore. Then, if ""your"" patent gets accepted by USPTO, you get a more substantial prize, along the lines of a week at some comfy resort. A lot of my co-workers asked the same question: ""Yeah, okay, that's nice, but there's a good chance that the company is going to make shitloads of money off a successful patent. A week at some resort doesn't really compare to that. Why don't you guys offer something that does?""<p>The guy who was explaining the incentive program responded: ""Because you patent an idea and that's worth exactly <i>nothing</i> until you implement that idea in a product and sell that product to customers. You had the idea, but it's the company that has the means to implement it and market it and sell it."" When you think about it, it's reasonable. Not precisely fair, but then again, things rarely are.<p>The point of this story is that software patents, just like all patents, are there to give the inventor a chance to implement the invention and make money from it, as a reward for the inventor's genius and hard work that went into coming up with an invention. That's obviously a good thing, because it gives you an incentive to invent something without having to fear that someone will simply steal your invention and make money off it.<p>Like every regulation with good intentions, it gets abused. What you said about trivial patents is just one way it gets abused. But another thing that makes it easy to abuse software patents is the duration of the patent. Twenty years is a hell of a long time in software. It practically invites patent trolling.",1306937672

That's why obvious software patents are so badthe basics of the young field weren't already claimed decades ago, the cost of ""reinvention"" is so low (one-click requires what, a napkin, a crayon, and half a beer?), and the licensing prices devolve to pure rent-seeking based on the necessity of the obvious idea.<p>What we need is some counter-balancing force that ensures patent license prices remain reasonable. Normally that's done by the threat of substitution or inventing-around, which doesn't work when USPTO screws up and allows claiming the whole problem space. The price especially needs to be reasonable for non-profit use, which is a software-specific issue made possible because our unit costs are also basically zero.

I use a low-end Blackberry (a typical phone around here), and I have a few different QR apps installed. Helpfully, the blurb under the QR code even recommended a reader.<p>Problem was, my camera/app combinations could not read the code. It was large, so I had to step away from the window to get the whole thing in focus. When I tried, people walked in front of me, blocking my view, and something (glare?) confused the readers. I gave up after a few minutes.<p>Would a better phone have made a difference? Probably. But my phone is quite typical of the type found in the target demographic. People who are exposed to frustrating experiences like mine are going to be put off.<p>I hope the people who do T shirts, scarves, etc, actually pay attention to the readability of their codes.<p>Here's someone else blogging on the Woolworths campaign - but unlike him, I doubt we will see much more QR from Woolworths for a while:

One possible solution would be to add a separate section for active comment threads. This might serve as an acceptable way to slow them down, or keep them visible longer.  However, the real time comments are a large part of what makes this site addictive, but it's also what provides a fair amount of the value.",1232841492

His answer was that Amazon has had a policy for years of not talking about competitors, not because they want to be evasive but because they don't want to take their focus off customers. Attention paid to what competitors are doing is attention not paid to what customers need next. I was deeply impressed by that.",1232841077

448533,comment,245227,245227,0,0,RobGR,,,"Here is the highest complement I can give to any computing science paper: it reminds me of certain Edsgar Djiksta's writing.<p>Here are some of the particular lines that catch my attention each time I read this (I end up seeing this presentation every year or so, through some link or forum or another):<p>""When did you last see an exciting non-commercial demo?""  When did you last see an exciting commercial one ?  It's all crap, not just the academic side.  I quit the ACM because I got tired of reading ""X 3.0 is the new X 2.0"" articles.  Remember back in the early days of shareware, when you could write a DOS program that did one thing, like a mortgage calculator, and it would get passed around all the BBS's and become famous for a couple of weeks ?  Most current programing is just that, but they are re-doing the one-off fadish programs for the newer platforms, web and smart phones and etc.<p>""Instead, we see a thriving software industry that largely ignores research, and a research community that writes papers rather than software.""  I'm not sure this is that special to computing science.  I think educational and research institutions quit mattering so much several decades ago.<p>""Linux's cleverness is not in the software, but in the development model, hardly a triumph of academic CS (especially software engineering) by any measure.""  I think the development model is very important, as important as the assembly line and interchangeable parts is to automotive engineering.  One can design the best car in the world, but if it can't be cranked out at the rate of one every 10 seconds it will never matter in the world.<p>""invention has been replaced by observation"" This applies to a lot of academic stuff theses days.  At certain conferences, there are papers presented that are nothing more than graphs of the number of papers in that field, a kind of pitch to convince people a particular field is the new hot thing.  I suppose they include their paper-about-papers in the next set of numbers for the next paper-about-papers.",1232840991

448525,comment,448378,448378,0,0,gruseom,,,"It's my fault for not being clearer, but you guys missed the point of the post. I'm not asking for advice about procrastination issues (I have some, but they're not that bad) and the general subject has been done to death already.<p>The point is that <i>given</i> that a lot of people have this problem (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=446924"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=446924</a>), here's a suggestion of something new to try.<p>Of the comments that do address the specific proposal (of shame-based noprocrast), there have been two objections. (1) Some people say they're not influenced by anybody else's opinion, or shouldn't be. I call that self-deception. (2) Others say it would be better to just stop procrastinating. Of course it would. That's like prescribing ""sleep"" for insomnia.<p>I still think it's a cool idea that would make for a fun experiment.<p>Edit: by the way, while I've facetiously emphasized the shame aspect, I don't think that's all there is to it. Lots of people have noticed that if you make a public commitment to do something, you're more likely to follow through. There's a lot of experimental data on that too.",1232839844

448511,comment,448250,448376,0,0,sangaya,,,"First off, I've read HN for a while and never felt the need for an account.  This post provided that need. Thank you.<p>""A Computer Science graduate, for instance, can often graduate without having ever written a line of html, javascript or css.""<p>In the interest of full disclosure I hold a BS in Computer Engineering and am currently working on a MS in Computer Science. I myself graduated without ever writing a single line of HTML, JavaScript, or CSS in any course and have yet to write a single line in my MS.<p>We used Assembler (16 and 32-bit, Motorola and Intel), C/C++, and Java. I never wrote HTML, but was required to write a basic web server that provided access to HTML pages. I didn't write any JavaScript, but did write code for embedded systems.<p>Point is no Computer Science student should ever write those as part of the program. For one, any student of CS worth their weight in salt can teach themselves such things. And the only time it's acceptable in the class room of a quality program is when the Professor asks for the documentation of the program to be an HTML page. In that case HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are an afterthought, not the point of the project, and not taught in the class room.",1232839142
448510,comment,448147,448147,0,0,cjwaters,,,"We have lots of people who use Paglo to monitor data center infrastructures. In fact we use Paglo extensively to monitor itself. The best thing is that it is easy to feed in custom data into Paglo and trend that alongside other information about the infrastructure. For example, I watch the side of queues in our messaging system together with the load averages, memory and bandwidth usage of key servers.<p>We also use monit to monitor and restart processes under Linux. It is great for handling a couple of services which leak memory and need to be restarted periodically.",1232838849

448508,comment,448250,448250,0,0,Ardit20,,,"I will make this comment only because I perceive that it is mostly people who are much older than me and left education a while ago that are commenting.<p>To me personally ( I have not read the article imply replying to the comments) seems that people are generalising excessively  and most importantly being very simplistic.<p>Education is a very very very big thing, education almost encompasses life itself and everything that life entails. As such it is not very easy to find the right answer to the question of: how can we best develop the youngsters of today for the skills of tomorrow.<p>For me personally I believe that the only way we can improve our educational system is by listening to the students and their criticisms or compliment for afterall it is them who are going through the day to day experiences of being taught. This approach is not perfect of course, but then hey nor is life. I simply think it is a much better aproach than allowing those who have been in a classroom 30 years ago dictating the order of the day although the posibilities are rather high that they have lost touch with the educational system.<p>That is only one part but then academia is so uterly complex as to take into consideration the hierarchical society that we find ourselves in and maybe conciously or uncoinciously upper the standart for some places while lowering it for others.Maybe against even this taking students view into consideration can counterbalance it.",1232838628

However, the fat is certainly not in the teaching staff but rather in the ""fixed costs"" - the ""bulding binge"" which the article only obliquely refers to.<p>One thing I'd like folks to consider, however. After all the fat is cut, who will buy anything?<p>The housing boom was all fat and got the economy going for six years. But without it, we're in a bit of trouble. Start cutting higher education too and what happens? Does efficiency create demand? Where is the evidence?",1232838481
448505,comment,447435,447970,0,0,kragen,,,"By 1994, when I first used Linux, it was <i>vastly</i> better than any other Unixes for interactive use.  The basic Unix software was much higher quality than other Unixes (see the original ""fuzz"") paper for some measurements of this), much more featureful (look at the old joke about GNU Hello, the ""hello, world"" program with 150 options), and much more usable (e.g. <i>--version</i> and <i>--help</i>, long options in general, tab-completion and WYSIWYG command-line editing in bash; compare to <i>csh</i> !-2:s/vresion/version/).<p>Linux defaults in 1994: <i>fvwm</i>, <i>rxvt</i>, color (in <i>ls</i> and <i>rxvt</i>), Emacs, Seyon, <i>less</i>.  Unix defaults in 1994: <i>twm</i> (or <i>mwm</i> if you were really unlucky), <i>xterm</i> (huge memory hog), black and white, <i>vi</i> (not Vim!), <i>cu</i>, and a <i>more</i> where you couldn't scroll backwards.  Also remember <i>term</i>?  You could get, approximately, an internet connection through a dialup shell account on Linux, by the simple expedient of recompiling all of your networking software to use <i>term</i>.<p>When I started using IRIX in 1994, <i>ls</i> to a terminal defaulted to single-column output; <i>find . -follow -print</i> on a directory with symlinks up the hierarchy would infinite-loop; <i>find</i> defaulted to starting from no directories and not doing anything with the files it found; etc.  It had a much prettier GUI and 3-D acceleration, though.<p>Remember also that at the time Microsoft OSes shipped with no TCP/IP support.",1232838289

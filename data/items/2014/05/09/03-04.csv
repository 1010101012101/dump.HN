Cloudflare should really consider doing this.<p>What&#x27;s more is that they are in a prime position to do this from a technology perspective too. The already have DDOS protection that does browser testing to make sure you aren&#x27;t a bot. The could repurposed that by IP block.<p>They also have enough engineers who understand which companies own which IP blocks.<p>I&#x27;m envisioning a banner at the top of my Cloudflare account that simply says &#x27;save the internet and participate in protecting net neutrality&#x27;. When I click on that I have three options:<p>- Yes. Opt in.<p>- No. Opt out.<p>- Custom.<p>Yes. Opt in: Cloudflare automatically throttle all blacklisted IP blocks. Users visiting from those IP blocks are presented with a page that explains why they are about to be throttled and tells them how to protest I.e. contact your congress representative, etc. The user is then throttled.<p>No. You don&#x27;t participate.<p>Custom: you get to tweak the blacklist. You can whitelist ranges, in case you have important business customers that you don&#x27;t want to piss off. You also get to select which of the different core blocked ranges you want to include. I.e. maybe there is a range for Comcast customers as well as Comcast offices and I find it cruel to penalise the Comcast customers, so I can unchecked them.<p>As an added bonus you can opt in to a &#x27;I want to publicise my site&#x27;. If you opt in to the protest then your site gets listed as a participant. Cloudflare can feature the big companies on the user pre-throttling warning page I mentioned earlier. They can also randomly show a list of smaller sites that are participating as well. They could also keep a leaderboard of the numbers of throttled users per site.",1399607993

If you&#x27;re doing Swing/OpenGL work, you&#x27;re not doing the sort of work that I am talking about.<p>In my experience, while this sort of development may deploy to different nix&#x27;s at different companies, within any particular company it tends to always deploy on only type of system.  Most &quot;mega-corps&quot; are not software vendors; when they develop software they are developing it for themselves.  This means that they control the entire stack, making portability <i>fairly</i> pointless.<p>When development in these organizations is done in other languages without such a &quot;portability culture&quot;, not a second of thought is given to portability.

With whitespace sensitivity, &quot;oops, I missed a brace&quot; and &quot;oops, I missed a tab&quot; is exactly the same. Your compiler/IDE would catch it, just as it would any other syntax error.

Aircraft are limited by their lifting capacity, and under most scenarios, the battery weight required (assuming conventional batteries) would exceed the maximum takeoff weight.<p>Though ships require prodigious amounts of fuel and travel long distances, I ran some calculations suggesting you <i>could</i> run the <i>Emma</i> off of LiON batteries -- they&#x27;d only take up about half her cargo capacity.  I still don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d want to.<p>I have a hard time seeing fuel getting cheaper, though among the benefits of, say, a solar-driven electricity-to-fuel synthesis using seawater as carbon and hydrogen feedstock is that the cost would be constant.  Your sunlight and water aren&#x27;t going to go away or get more expensive over even geological time, and PV is also based on an abundant material (silicon, plus dopants).  So long as population is kept in check, you&#x27;ve got an option for a constant-cost fuel supply for the future.  Even if that&#x27;s more expensive than today, assuming the net cycle EROEI is below a technological civilization sustaining threshold (estimated at between 6:1 and 9:1 by Charles A.F. Hall), we <i>might</i> pull things off.<p>Then there&#x27;s just <i>other</i> resources and pollution issues to be concerned with.",1399607773

The fundamental bet by my company is actually basically the same one that Julia makes: higher level languages combined with dynamic compilation are the only route to performance in our modern world of heterogeneous hardware.<p>My company sells a Python-to-GPU and Python-to-x86 compiler.  It matches or beats hand-rolled C and C++ for some cases, and is loads easier to deal with when it comes to CUDA work.  It&#x27;s still in its infancy, but the approach (in my mind) is definitely validated.<p>If you think about it, why <i>should</i> C be the speed king?  Most programmers cannot reason about cache coherency to save their lives and that&#x27;s the dominant performance cost for real performance.  Many of the big numerical codes follow some high level patterns of data movement; if a compiler has greater visibility into the structure of both the data and the algorithm, it has an easier time parallelizing and optimizing, than if it has to rely on the programmer to &quot;lower&quot; the algorithm to a layer that&#x27;s just a hair above RTL.  &quot;C is just portable assembly&quot; and all that.<p>Additionally, FWIW, if you really want to pick nits, a lot of NumPy is actually <i>not</i> written in C, but rather a custom macro template system which then creates C code for each of the core types (int8, uint8, int16, etc. etc.).  So even for the low-level guts, code generation (albeit a very simple mechanism) is the current approach.",1399606424

I would disagree that Motorola can be considered a high quality brand when it comes to smartphones. Yes, their recent X and G were really good phones for the price, but many Americans still see Android and Galaxy as synonymous, so I wouldn&#x27;t say Moto is high quality.<p>I&#x27;m coming from a different POV from you when it comes to laptops. I&#x27;m 20 years old and started off with cheap laptops. But I&#x27;ve always lusted after Thinkpads and now a Yoga Pro 2 after having tried one so for me, the Lenovo brand looks really appealing. I haven&#x27;t found any other hardware that appealed as much besides a Macbook.",1399791582

7728016,comment,7727358,7727706,5,0,jboggan,,,"Having previously worked in the ATM industry I can say that this is a very serious problem.<p>Physical security is a big deal with ATMs and I haven&#x27;t seen a single Bitcoin ATM yet that is physically secure.  They all utilize flimsy enclosures that are easily defeated with a crowbar, allowing access both to the cash cassettes and (more importantly for Bitcoin ATMs) the computer cage that necessarily has the private keys on it.  If someone were serious about physical security they&#x27;d be finding old NCR 5888&#x27;s or 5886&#x27;s for cheap on the used market and refurbing them to work with Bitcoin, since they have physical safes that are real deterrents.  You&#x27;d still have to relocate the &quot;cages&quot; to be inside the safe enclosure (keeping the private keys safe), but that wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal with a Raspberry Pi or other small form factor Linux machine.",1399791457

7728006,comment,7725080,7725898,1,0,etfb,,,"My major objections boil down to aesthetics and culture.  The themes and layouts that shipped with Drupal 6 and below were all eye-bleedingly ugly, really obviously designed by developers with no eye for colour, layout, white space or typography.  In those days, you could tell someone was looking at a Drupal website just from the sound of them rattling through the cutlery draw trying to find a spoon so they could gouge their own eyes out.  This carried over to the ridiculously complex menu system and the barely usable administration methods, which made it actively unpleasant to use the system as developer OR user.<p>I gather D7 has improved on this a bit, though it&#x27;s still nowhere near Wordpress in this regard.<p>The main trouble I had with the culture was that complexity was seen as something necessary for power; as in, you can&#x27;t achieve a result with a simple system.  You can only chop down a tree with a Swiss Army Knife; an axe is too simple.  This carried over into the disastrous decision to throw out all the code, including third-party extensions, in every major version update, meaning that stuff you wrote and tricks you learned for version N would be almost completely useless for version N+1.  I found that idea so totally beyond hopeless that I was forced to throw out what I had spent years laboriously learning and move over to Wordpress, which suffers from none of these problems.",1399791125

7727978,comment,7725129,7725530,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"There are multiple types of law, but all of it addresses the public&#x27;s sense of acceptable tolerances of moral behavior.  If someone immorally acquired a patent, there are or should be legal functions to provide redress. If the legal structure necessary does not yet exist, that&#x27;s why you have representatives. Call them.<p>&quot;Public shaming&quot; is not a good behavior in civilized society. Think about the patent from the perspective of the authors. Consider their motives. It&#x27;s very unlikely that the motive is &quot;I&#x27;m going to sue everyone who takes a picture on a white background.&quot; Consider the importance of a defensive patent portfolio and the likelihood that a case that actually did cite this patent would fail. It&#x27;s entirely plausible that the patent was acquired for purely defensive purposes (&quot;If we don&#x27;t claim it, a less-good entity will, and they&#x27;ll use it irresponsibly&quot;).<p>Even after all this, perhaps the authors simply have a different perspective than many on HN. It&#x27;s not actually objectively evil to have differing or uncommon beliefs on what comprises a valid patent. Does that disagreement really justify the complete obliteration of the person&#x27;s privacy?<p>I keep posting about this on HN and people keep ignoring it, but this is just another example of the rapid deterioration of civil society. If people can&#x27;t even disagree on a matter as blase as intellectual property law without getting doxxed and run out of their homes, we have a very serious problem with major ramifications for the continued existence of free society.",1399790191

This mostly relates to layer 7, which is much more complex than ports and protocol based detection. The idea is; if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re looking for (presumably a 0-day or unknown threat), then how would one find it? The answer is, research (aka analyze) the data. This ranges from Flow Data (which can date back months/years) to Packet Captures, to even Real Time Deep Packet Inspection (all relating to SIEM Solutions). In these scenarios, you would be looking for the needle in the haystack, but the needle is not clearly defined. You would have to work to identify and define it. So research does relate to identifying illegal/commercial/malware activity. Organizations that understand this are working towards implementing (or have already implemented) real time adaptive security models to mitigate these threats. This will allow them to not only identify and attempt to stop unknown Security Incidents, but also effectively investigate Incidents (forensics).",1399789760

Time cures such things.  And Motif was definitely a vendor perpetrated unmitigated disaster: the worst of it was that it &quot;succeeded&quot; in unifying the UNIX gui, which means it succeeded at stopping all reasonable work on gui&#x27;s on UNIX until the young Linux turks took over.<p>JG> And by &#x27;93 or so, the UNIX vendors actively wanted no change, as they had given up on the desktop and any innovation would cost them money.<p>DH>> The whole &quot;Unix-Haters Handbook&quot; thing was intended to shake up the status quo and inspire people to improve the situation instead of blindly accepting the received view.

I won&#x27;t hold it against you ;-).  Though any operating system with ddt as its shell is downright user hostile...<p>JG>>> The day I thought X was dead was the day I installed CDE on my Alpha.<p>DH>> And then Linux came along and changed all the rules and assumptions!<p>JG>>> It was years later I realized the young turks were ignoring the disaster perpetrated by the UNIX vendors in the name of &quot;standardization&quot;; since then, Keith Packard and I have tried to pay for our design mistakes in X by things like the new font model, X Render extension, Composite, and Cairo, while putting stakes in the heart of disasters like XIE, LBX, PEX, the old X core font model, and similar design by committee mistakes (though the broken core 2D graphics and font stuff must be considered &quot;original sin&quot; committed by people who didn&#x27;t know any better at the\ntime).<p>DH>> Cairo looks wonderful! I&#x27;m looking forward to using it from Python, which should be lots of fun.<p>JG> Yup.  Cairo is <i>really</i> good stuff.  This time we had the benefit of Lyle Ramshaw to get us unstuck.  Would that I&#x27;d known Lyle in 1986; but it was too late 3 years later when I got to know him.<p>DH>> A lot of that old X11 stuff was thrown in by big companies to shill existing products (like using PEX to sell 3d graphics hardware, by drawing rotating 3-d cubes in an attempt to hypnotize people).<p>DH>> Remember UIL? I heard that was written by the VMS trolls at DEC, who naturally designed it with an 132 column line length limitation and no pre-processor of course. The word on the street was that DEC threw down the gauntlet and insisted on UIL being included in the standard, even though the rest of the committee hated it for sucking so bad. But DEC threatened to hold their breath until they got their way.<p>DH>> And there were a lot of weird dynamics around commercial extensions like Display PostScript, which (as I remember it) was used as an excuse for not fixing the font problems a lot earlier: &quot;If you want to do readable text, then you should be using Display PostScript.&quot; \nThe problem was that Linux doesn&#x27;t have a vendor to pay the Display PostScript licensing fee to Adobe, so Linux drove a lot of &quot;urban renewal&quot; of problems that had been sidelined by the big blundering companies originally involved with X.<p>JG> Yup.  Though I don&#x27;t know the exact history there.<p>JG> I was really burned out after X11, and had an undiagnosed medical problem.  So I wasn&#x27;t in the fight for sanity when most of that junk happened; and Bob Scheifler&#x27;s personality is such that he didn&#x27;t either, and was at that point still very focused on the base system.  And SGI saw OpenGL as a competitive advantage, so PEX took a slow death.<p>JG>>> So we&#x27;ve mostly succeeded at dragging the old whale off the beach and getting it to live again.<p>DH>> Hey, that&#x27;s a lot better than dynamiting the whale, which seemed like a such good idea at the time!

7727946,comment,7727473,7727799,1,0,jsmthrowaway,,,"> Do you really run an operation where you have soldered together all of your servers, created a data center inside your headquarters, within which you run all of your mission critical CI/testing/deployment services? Because unless you&#x27;re one of a handful of tech companies,<p>The contrary. You represent the handful that didn&#x27;t, and the &quot;handful&quot; of tech companies you suggest is much larger than you think.<p>Based on this comment and the recent reply in this thread I can tell you&#x27;ve mostly worked with small-scale architectures. Third party tooling and workflows do make a lot of sense at a small scale, but the point at which you outgrow those solutions comes a lot sooner than you think. When I arrived at Foursquare the entire operation was on Amazon; when I left a year and a half later, much of it was on physical equipment. And Foursquare is not a Google-scale operation -- virtualization and customer cotenancy just have a <i>serious</i> impact on SLA that is less pronounced at smaller scales.<p>It&#x27;s easy to think your experiences represent the industry, as your comments suggest. It&#x27;s also easy to think HN represents the industry, where startups reign supreme and everybody loves working Lean Devops. The fact is, neither of those statements are accurate, and beyond a six (or maybe seven) figure architecture you start having a harder time justifying third parties financially and operationally.<p>I do use Amazon currently, just as an off-site backup for on-site monitoring that I&#x27;ve built.

An America with the additional 51st state of Germany, 52nd of South Korea, 53rd of Cuba, 54th of the Philippines and 55th of Japan? Hell, why stop there? An American claim to France would have been just as strong as a Roman claim to Egypt (namely, America claims it, who disagrees?), let's seize Canada, stop paying for oil to the House of Saud, figure out what we're going to do with our territories of Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. America isn't a true empire, but it has some flavors of one.<p>The U.S. is a weird sort of quasi-empire with military outposts and large economic interests all over the world, but in territories that aren't their own and with the notion that the countries we inhabit are not part of the U.S. in any way shape or form. Sort of like vassal states, but without all the ""pay us your tribute or we'll invade and burn your cities down"" that modern America is terribly uncomfortable with.<p>It's an interesting academic exercise to pick apart where the U.S. is and isn't like an Empire because it's not that simple.",1341208721

Is there any other reasonable way that space-derived technologies (e.g. those on this list[0]) could have been invented?<p>If the US wants to pay off it debts, maybe the first thing to do is reduce the amount spend on, for example, the military. The US spends $700+ billion dollars (or 4% of GDP) on its military[1], on something that is even less of a net benefit to humanity: killing people.<p>Surely the $20 billion[2] currently spent on NASA pales in comparison to that, and the benefit to humanity of non-military technological improvement is far larger. (Clearly, DARPA et al. fund technological improvement too, but the purpose, and first use, of these technologies is normally quite saddening.)<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spin-off_technologies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spin-off_technologies</a>\n[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_e...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA</a>",1341208713

So I think it's the thought process that counts, the education, critical thinking, absorbing lots of information, etc. Not whether you've travelled enough or lived outside the US. I do agree that many Americans live inside a kind of bubble, one built out of a mixture of propaganda and intellectual laziness, perhaps, but a perceptual bubble all the same. The Republican party, for example, I think to a large extent helps to feed it and is in turn fed from it. But we don't really live in the world portrayed in that bubble.

I guess the main reason is that women were/are not empowered enough to decide how many kids they should have. Another major factor is lack of availability/knowledge of contraceptives. Also, I think children provide the only ""entertainment""(using this word very loosely) when you have no TV, no books etc; there may also be a feeling that having many children gurantees that some will survive to carry their ""family"" ahead (many might die due to lack of access to healthcare). \nLastly, child labour.\nMost of these are purely speculative though.

Wealthy people may on average make better resource allocation decisions, but sometimes there are mistakes. Progressive taxes prevent wealthy people from gaining so much that a single mistake will be catastrophic.<p>The mechanism by which the free market performs better than a command economy is that of distributed decisions.

Amidst all this kids are considered as a somebody who can take care of their parents.<p>For the west this might sound strange, but parents are a integral part of the family. In fact family means Parents, siblings and their kids included.<p>In all this Boys are considered cash cows. Because they are perceived as somebody who can earn and feed them in old age. Girls are considered money drains, as they marry and go away to their husbands home, to never return or contribute much.

Another side is what you so easily dismiss - the history and traditions. Culture in the sense we're discussing is not something you can associate with one person. It's a collective term that basically describes the full range of learned human behavior patterns, which of course includes the baggage accumulated over the years (in some cases thousands of years) of history. Which USA doesn't have in the same degree as most of other countries, simply because it is a relatively young country.<p>Maybe I put too much stress on the traditional side of culture but coming myself from culturally very uniform background I always thought about USA as a multi-culture nation. Hence my surprise at pixie's statement. Shared media, history and education are basically common traits of every country (except for the ones that changed borders recently). Unity of values and the perception of the surrounding world may really be unique to America, though I'm not sure if putting Black people from Boston and immigrants from Asia and Mexico in the same bag as Rednecks from Florida is not an overgeneralization.<p>What you describe as a part of culture I see as a proof of multi-culturality. Can multi-culturality be a part of culture? I guess it depends on the definition. But I would argue that American culture is not uniform (of course many aspects are but I think most historically rich countries are much more uniform in that matter).<p>I admit it's kind of remarkable how everyone is religious in America. A bit less if you look at the crime rate (what happened to Thou shalt not kill?) but still. However I still stand by my previous statement - all the things you mention are not characteristic only to America. Maybe you can't appreciate it because it's a foreign culture to you but culture of many countries is just as uniform as American and often richer thanks to the hundreds of years of history. And wealth is hardly an American-only thing. As I mentioned, all these points together apply to Japan as well and many of them (not necessarily all at once) to other countries as well.",1341206507

What most folks don't conceptualize well is that the width of the timeline which constitutes ""humans are here"" is so damn small on a 4 billion year timeline as to be hard to spot with the naked eye :-).<p>But lets look at your points:\n1) You don't have a good grasp of physics but that's ok. One of the things that happens as you accelerate is that you gp through something called time dilation. Travelling a significant fractions of the speed of light will have time passing much much more slowly on the ship than on Earth. You'll want to work it out so that you approach 'c' at the halfway point, then flip over and decelerate. If you do it that way your crew will easily survive the entire trip. There is the question of energy and reaction mass, real problems and as yet unsolved, but not insoluble. We <i>can</i> and do regularly manufacture anti-matter these days, its a pretty good fuel.<p>2) You make a number of interesting assumptions here. One is that aliens are 65 million miles away. Consider that we already know that our planet is a death trap, its killed off everything several times already, so we figure out how to leave. Better we create our own environments where all we need do is scoop up interstellar hydrogen for fuel, or perhaps harvest a bit of space junk. The Earth is a spaceship that is gravity locked to the Sun. There is certainly enough material in our solar system to build something that could wander amongst the stars. And if we've figured out cellular biology, and can thus 'fix' any issues that come up, it means we can 'live' in our bodies forever via mechanical repair. If we can do it, so can other species. Imagine a flotilla of 'units' moving in parallel, carrying our alien visitors, from star system to star system. Perhaps seeing a new system every 100 years or so.<p>3) We can certainly create habitats that don't kill us and that keep things that might kill us out. Further there is a really really interesting change coming when pieces of how people work comes together in a provable way. One good thing, the health care crisis for 'rich' people will be gone. Once we've got the source code, all bets are off.<p>4) This is just projection ;-) We would go visit a society that was in its early stages of development just to see how they do it. We've been doing that with indigenous island people on the planet, I would be surprised if we had interplanetary capability and we <i>didn't</i> do that.",1341205760

SoJs occupied the smallest possible amount of space in the inventory (1 square). They also had high intrinsic value, as they were not only powerful items but also ingredients in two important crafting recipes.<p>Interestingly, SoJs lost their currency status once their intrinsic value depreciated [1]. A new mechanic, runes, was introduced, and they became the new currency. However, to my knowledge no single rune type rose to dominate the others and claim true currency status, so the current market is a bit more muddled.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.diablowiki.com/The_Stone_of_Jordan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diablowiki.com/The_Stone_of_Jordan</a>",1341205573

It's not just a fancy way of saying ""can do work quickly"" in most situations, it's more a declaration that ""ignorant people are going to constantly and unreasonably hound you regarding completion of the project and they won't be satisfied when you get it done"".

1268767,comment,1267741,1268615,0,0,philwelch,,,"No, they're separate things. Price segmentation is selling marginally different products, but making each product available to everyone. So you have Windows 7 Ultimate and Windows 7 Professional and Windows 7 Home and Windows 7 Home Professional and Windows 7 Ultimate Home Datacenter Server at separate prices, and even though the only difference is that you run a different build script, it's not the same as price discrimination because you let the consumer choose. I interviewed at a company once that made a home-architecture CAD tool. They sell about 20 different versions of the same software, all at different price points, each generated by different build settings from the same codebase.<p>Price discrimination is when you sell the same thing to different people for different prices. It's technically illegal, so universities get around it by sending you a $50,000 tuition bill and a $40,000 need-based scholarship instead of just sending you a $10,000 bill. Other forms of price discrimination include student discounts and senior discounts. Health care in the US thrives on price discrimination--the simple words ""I don't have insurance, can we talk about arranging payment"" can knock off 50% or better of your bills with some doctors.<p>Price discrimination at elite colleges means ""rising tuition costs"" are really much ado about nothing. The nominal tuition only represents what they charge rich people, which is often independent of what they charge <i>not-</i>rich people.",1271361126

The bytecode itself lends to better interpretation (and it wouldn't be useful on a general purpose PC where you have the resources to JIT).<p>> <i>what indications of Java 7 being agreed on and adopted are there that should make someone more optimistic than about say Python 3 or Perl 6?</i><p>InvokeDynamic.<p>Dynamic languages on top of the JVM are already fast. Jython / JRuby are already ahead of the reference interpreters in many benchmarks. And in real-world projects it is much nicer to drop to Java for bottlenecks than to C/C++.<p>In JDK7 InvokeDynamic provides a way to specify a handler for a call-site the JVM doesn't understand (and I think the caching is at least monomorphic). Thus it is possible for dynamic calls (with an unknown interface) to be as fast as virtual methods invocations (blazingly fast on the JVM).<p>And for JDK6 there's even a backport (using Java agents) for backward compatibility (also with speed improvements).<p>I haven't seen any real project (or any significant open-source project other than Parrot / Perl6 itself) that's based on Perl 6. And it was started when? 10 years ago?<p>And many people would argue that Python 3 only brings a couple of syntactic improvements. Only Unladen Swallow makes it exciting for me.<p>Until then, some reasons why it's not exciting for me ... GIL (no parallel threads), reference-counted (huge memory usage on long running processes), still slow as fuck for expensive computations.<p>Python is my favorite language, but I'm moving gradually to using Jython more and more.<p>> <i>losing more ground to C# (by nearly all accounts now a superior platform</i><p>No, not really.

I was replying to the sentiment that because the world doesn't consist of 100k people, you can't call 100k people's goals the world's goals. I may not have expressed that as clearly as I could have.<p>I agree; this represents only a certain type of person in the world, but again, conclusions about the world have been drawn from more specific types.<p>I just feel it's petty to focus on the title of the article, when the word ""world"" is consistently applied in narrower senses.",1271358367

And one that actually matters for open source - where, after all, the goal is for other people to be able to modify your source code.<p>But it's completely irrelevant here. If nobody is going to modify your code but you, and if you can produce apps that work great on the iPhone, why should they care whether you write it by editing Objective C or by singing Hungarian love songs into an electric toothbrush?",1271358252

'Where' is hard to google, prone to confusion in spoken communication, and very generic. For example, a conference for their market is already called ""Where 2.0"".<p>I'm wary of 'Where' as a name. Will 'Where' wear well, if whereever it's discussed we're also hearing competitors' wares emphasizing 'where' features? Where, with all these word collisions, will Where find the werewithal to forge a brand image where we're likely to see 'Where' as meaning what Where wants 'Where' to mean?",1271358139

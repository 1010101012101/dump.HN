4217700,comment,4215864,4217278,2,0,w0utert,,,"> Additionally, I'd love to take a few years off and spend more time with my family. Being tethered to a job, regardless of how much it pays, will not allow me to do that. Making a shitload of cash will.<p>This pretty much sums it up as far as I'm concerned. We all have only one shot at life on this planet, so unless you're comfortable spending all of your productive years working for just enough money to stay afloat, you'll want to save up as much money as you can, to buy yourself the freedom to make radical changes to the course of your life when the time comes that's what's necessary to 'increase happiness'.<p>I always get a little annoyed when people say or write stuff such as 'money does not buy you happiness'. In our modern, western societies, it actually <i>does</i> buy you happiness, provided you have enough of it, and don't blow it all on materialistic things. All those quasi-romantical perspectives how it's immaterial things like health, family and friends that make you happy are missing the point. It's not about money, that's just a medium of wealth, but about the opportunities you have for yourself and your loved ones to enjoy life. If you're lucky enough to have good health, family, friends <i>and</i> the financial means to make the most out of the privilege of having all that, you can be much happier than when you have to miss either one of those.<p>I realize that this may sound awfully shallow and materialistic, but it's just my observation of how this world turns. Sure enough you can be happy without being wealthy, but in the end, almost everyone would prefer being happy <i>and</i> wealthy, for the simple fact that it provides opportunities that are simply unattainable if you're happy but broke.",1341835155

The vast malware landscape would very much disagree.<p>I think that it <i>is</i> harder with cars, if only because they have to have an open gate to the heart of their system. Plug in, turn on laptop, access! Apparently that's enshrined in both EU and US law, so not very easy to overcome in the near future.<p>I do agree with the heart of your message though: this is the year 2012, and whilst as a non-security bod it's easy for me to say, <i>these things really shouldn't be happening</i>.",1341835127

That was the clearest, most rational thought in the entire post and it is unfortunate that you did not pay heed to it.<p>1. These guys have worked pretty hard and/or are pretty damned smart which was the reason they got in there in the first place. The placement opportunities reflect exactly that and that is a pretty strong incentive for them not to launch their own startup.<p>2. Getting some working experience is a very good thing because their jobs offer them great exposure and experience, a pretty strong network of people and a clearer picture of what they are up against. While jumping off a cliff might be very brave and fashionable thing to do, it might not always be the smartest.<p>The startup ecosystem sucks in India and is nothing compared to the US (I leave room for the grass is greener effect - I don't think that is the case here). Funding is hard to come by and most business don't like dealing with startups. When the odds are that badly stacked against you, a broader network of people helps enormously.<p>3. A good %age are <i>gasp</i> actually interested in their engineering courses (IITM particularly has a healthy number & tradition) and pursue further studies abroad. A few of them go on to start their own companies in the US and others contribute to startups there.<p>4. When I see the word solution, I expect to actually see a solution - not read why you think it is an inherent quality.<p>5. Never use statements like ""X group never does it"". It takes away whatever miniscule credibility the article has. Some obvious examples of IITians doing startups: Flipkart, Rabi Kisku entertainment (Rabi Kisku and Siddharth Nuni are about to release their movie Software Hardware kya yaaroon) and several several more. You just have to look.<p>6. Startups are not for everyone. Hardworking and smart alone doesn't cut it and it is not a bad thing that not all these guys are doing it. Doesn't mean they are wasting their life away.<p>Disclaimer: I was one of those Vetti 5 pointers at IITM, who took a 2.75l job in 2006 ago and I am running my own bootstrapped startup with my batchmate since 2011. If my startup fails (at my last stand), I don't think I will do a bootstrapped startup in India ever again and that has very little to do with the size of my cojones.",1341835109

4217635,comment,4215864,4216798,4,0,_delirium,,,"I wonder if that direct adjustment is actually the proper way to do it. That's implying a hypothesis that the money-happiness relationship varies due to COL, but is constant once adjusted for purchasing-power parity. But it seems at least plausible that the relationship is a different one. I'd be interested if anyone's directly studied what the money-happiness correlation is in NYC versus, say, Omaha. I wouldn't be surprised to see a deviation in either direction; perhaps New Yorkers need <i>more</i> than the COL-adjusted equivalent to be happy, or perhaps they need less. May even vary among sub-groups.<p>In my own case, I've found that the amount of money I need to be satisfied with my income tends to scale less than linearly with COL. In higher-COL places I spend a bigger proportion of my income on rent, and do more low-cost entertainment, in part because more low-cost entertainment is available. For example, I've lived in both Houston and Santa Cruz, and I was quite happy doing a lot of free and cheap things in Santa Cruz, with its  great beaches, hiking, etc. In Houston, I had to spend money for entertainment.",1341833891

But, what I've come to realize is that I am the problem. I chose this path. When I've had problems at a job, it is a result of not leaving it and making the choice to take it in the first place. Now, many of the details you don't learn until after you take it, but I would have had the same general idea what it would have been like had I taken the time to really think about it. I look forward to a time when I can find something that I'm great at, that I love doing, and I love how and where I do it.

4217566,comment,4213386,4214519,3,0,jacobolus,,,"Almost every multiplayer strategy game becomes more about the players involved than the specific game rules, once at least some of the players have a bit of the strategy figured out. And pretty much any 3 or 4 player game can be thrown by a player who decides he doesnt care to try to win himself (this is even often true in 6 player games, though it usually takes a bit of skill and cooperation from the to whom the game is being handed).<p>One way to make multiplayer games interesting is to have enough variance so that with 3 players left, the balance between a player who pulls some lucky breaks and the other two players working together is just barely in favor of the two players. If the game is well designed and the players act strategically, this shifting balance of alliances can last quite a while without either handing one of the players the game or getting boring, and winning is about figuring out how to hold your ally past the time its in his best interest to turn on you, or turning on him at just the right moment to maximize impact.",1341831825

I can't expect why the average person in India would scream ""Scandal!"" at the project's failure - the government doesn't have a fantastic track record and doesn't have the resources to attract the kind of people that can make such stuff (i.e. the Aakash Tablet) happen. The average Indian isn't so concerned about their government screwing up because that is the norm.<p>Anyway that was offtopic. The IITs have a very high average IQ that manifests itself well in the form of publications and the accomplishments of the alumni/students/faculty - they are definitely not ""education factories"" and an engineering degree from there is very respected. Pitting them against institutions with endowments in excess of 8bn is unfair.",1341831722

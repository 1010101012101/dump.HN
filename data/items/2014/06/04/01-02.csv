7843628,comment,7839602,7841072,1,0,ekianjo,,,"> And using third-party engines doesn&#x27;t directly address a lot of the other questions about Linux gaming (drivers, fragmentation, back-catalog games), it doesn&#x27;t help out with the large number of AAA games that are made on first-party engines (Square Enix uses a lot of Crystal Engine, Ubisoft has a handful of its own engines, EA games use their own engines for the most part), and it doesn&#x27;t help turn Linux into a more compelling general-purpose desktop OS.<p>Wow, a lot of points made in a very few words. Here&#x27;s my take on your comments:<p>* Drivers: massively improved for nVidia cards, probably very close to Windows performance nowadays. For ATI, I guess the state of it is &quot;meh&quot;, but it&#x27;s getting a bit better progressively. For now gaming on Linux should be with nVidia (and Intel).<p>* Fragmentation: this problem is a myth and has been debunked so many times already, I don&#x27;t want to discuss it here.<p>* Back catalog games: a lot of it can be handled with WINE with no additional modification needed.<p>* AAA games engines: Square Enix is a Japanese publisher, focused on Consoles first, then PC, and when they mean PC they only have the image of Windows because Linux is non-existent in Japan (mostly). So I would not be surprised if they were the very last ones to jump on the bandwagon. UbiSoft has become a &quot;console first&quot; publisher as well, so I don&#x27;t hope much from their side as well.<p>* compelling desktop OS: Linux in some of its best distros IS already very compelling, much more than Windows 8 where you have to relearn everything from scratch again. It&#x27;s faster, you have repositories for updates, Firefox runs like a dream on it (on the same hardware I always find the Windows version running way more slowly), and you have great Free Software for most of the uses you need, without viruses, ads and stuff like that. It&#x27;s VERY functional. Of course some people will bitch about not having Adobe products, or X or Y software, but you can always keep a double boot or a virtual machine if you really need something. Distros get updates automatically, instead of the ancient way of doing updates on Windows with service packs and the like. Since I&#x27;ve switched to Linux years ago I have never looked back, except for games and video editing. And I know I&#x27;m not the only one, and I see Linux distros improving release after release.",1401846594

7843560,comment,7842282,7842850,8,0,rkudeshi,,,"I&#x27;m not a woman, so take this with a grain of salt, but here&#x27;s some feedback on the website:<p>1) Your images are too compressed. The artifacts make it look low quality, like I shouldn&#x27;t trust the site. If you are selling upscale clothes, you should make sure your images reflect that. Maybe use PNG instead of JPG?<p>2) The logo on the top left is kind of small and doesn&#x27;t really stand out (black on white). Perhaps use a different color? Also, the font you used makes it look like you made the logo yourself. I don&#x27;t know if you did or not, but it doesn&#x27;t match up with the upscale clothing you&#x27;re selling. I know there are websites where you can make your own royalty-free logos (google &quot;logo designer&quot; or something), look into one of those maybe? And perhaps try to pick a more distinctive font, maybe something that isn&#x27;t in a standard install of Word, so it stands out.<p>3) I have to scroll down all the way to the bottom of the page (had to press spacebar 4 times!) to see actual clothing you have for sale. Most people never go below the fold and would have no idea what your website sells (especially since the name doesn&#x27;t immediately reflect Asian-inspired clothing). Your name doesn&#x27;t have to be related to what you sell (just look at Amazon), but I need to be able to immediately figure out what stuff you do sell when I first hit your homepage, either via the logo or pictures of actual stuff for sale above the fold.<p>4) Related to the previous point, why are the category pictures so huge? I&#x27;m on a 13&quot; Macbook Air and all but one of them are larger than the viewport (since you keep the header stuck at the top). I would suggest making them much, much smaller - one or two horizontal rows with 3-4 square category icons). Or cut them down to half the size they are now and move them below the Top Sellers + Featured rows.<p>5) Your titlebar text doesn&#x27;t say anything about the site. Good place to put more information about exactly what kind of clothing you&#x27;re selling (will also help with SEO). Even as simple as &quot;Janjua Clothing - Indian designer clothing&quot; or &quot;Janjua Clothing | Indian clothing | Designer clothes | Affordable prices&quot; or something like that.<p>6) Your site is very busy right now. If you&#x27;ve tried every marketing tool in the book and you still have no sales to date, perhaps it&#x27;s time to consider a wholesale redesign. It looks like you&#x27;re using some type of eCommerce plugin or CMS...do they have any other themes you could use? Perhaps something drastically simpler that maybe only focuses on 1-2 items in your inventory that you know sell well (based on other sites or locally in B&M stores or whatever)?<p>7) Take a look at other ecommerce and clothing websites and see what design stuff works for them. Rakuten, Blue Nile, Zappos, Dollar Shave Club, etc.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not a woman or a web designer or anything like that. Just a normal dude giving you honest feedback on my first impressions. Hope some of this helps.<p>EDIT: One more website I just stumbled across: <a href=""http://www.buffalobottlecraft.com/#products"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buffalobottlecraft.com/#products</a> - super simple, one high-quality picture at the top and then 8 products for sale, all shown on the homepage. This is along the lines of what I&#x27;m suggesting your website could look like. The most important thing is that this website <i>looks</i> trustworthy. I would feel comfortable buying something from this website. Your website doesn&#x27;t do that for me yet (sorry, just being honest), so even if I were in your target market, I would hesitate before buying. A good design is invaluable in conveying trust.",1401844353

Swift + playground feels like the new dreamweaver to me. Either people are gonna write ugly code that shows them what they want to do or keep building quality apps, I don&#x27;t know, I guess future will tell us. But I guess my main point was just that where I personally would try to reduce the gap between the different layers so we developers know what happens from A to Z (at least on the software side), the industry is clearly adding layer on layers such a way it&#x27;s nearly impossible to control and understand the whole thing.",1401844038

I don&#x27;t need a car, I don&#x27;t need a smartphone, I don&#x27;t need a TV, I don&#x27;t need more than a few clothes, I don&#x27;t need furniture other than a bed, I don&#x27;t need to eat out or eat expensive food/drinks, if I wasn&#x27;t working I wouldn&#x27;t even need a computer and internet.  I&#x27;m quite happy without most of those things.  I make an engineer&#x27;s salary and save almost all of it, so that one year out of college (cheap education, no loans) I now have savings that could easily last me 5 years in the bay area at my current lifestyle (counting housing/food/healthcare) or significantly longer in a cheaper area.  (Though I&#x27;m not quitting yet, I still enjoy my job and maybe there&#x27;s the beginnings of golden handcuffs there.)<p>Unfortunately for my case, I expect it will be hard to raise a family on this below-standard-expenditure lifestyle, although that is something I think I want to do.  For one thing, I can&#x27;t imagine how I&#x27;d find a wife who was on board with living without all the standard American luxuries.  I imagine such a woman exists, but I wouldn&#x27;t know where to look.<p>And even though I want to take a bunch of time off and travel the world / work on my own (zero-hope-for-profit) hobby projects, I can imagine society&#x27;s disapproval of this, and also can&#x27;t help but wonder if I&#x27;d regret it.  What if it was hard to get a job as good as this if I later wanted to go in for money like everyone else?",1401843885

Your pay comes from other people giving it to you willingly. They wouldn&#x27;t give it to you unless you were helping them somehow.<p>I think the confusion is that, as you get paid more, you tend to help people less directly. A minimum-wage fast-food worker is obviously helping people. That&#x27;s what he does. He probably says the literal words, &quot;May I help you?&quot; a hundred times a day.

He&#x27;s not directly helping people. In his day to day work, he doesn&#x27;t interact with the customers.

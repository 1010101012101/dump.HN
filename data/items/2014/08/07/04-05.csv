8146331,comment,8145785,8146292,4,0,joenathan,,,">Microsoft refused to support physical address extensions in XP<p>Completely wrong<p>&quot;The original releases of Windows XP and Windows XP SP1 used PAE mode to allow RAM to extend beyond the 4 GB address limit. However, it led to compatibility problems with 3rd party drivers which led Microsoft to remove this capability in Windows XP Service Pack 2. Windows XP SP2 and later, by default, on processors with the no-execute (NX) or execute-disable (XD) feature, runs in PAE mode in order to allow NX.[14] The no execute (NX, or XD for execution disable) bit resides in bit 63 of the page table entry and, without PAE, page table entries on 32-bit systems have only 32 bits; therefore PAE mode is required in order to exploit the NX feature. However, &quot;client&quot; versions of 32-bit Windows (Windows XP SP2 and later, Windows Vista, Windows 7) limit physical address space to the first 4 GB for driver compatibility  via the licensing limitation mechanism, even though these versions do run in PAE mode if NX support is enabled.<p>Windows 8 will only run on processors which support PAE, in addition to NX and SSE2.&quot;<p>- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension#Microsoft_Windows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension#Micr...</a>",1407387447

And I realized that life is too short to chase after these things instead of choosing to work what you want to work on but not being so hard on yourself to stop you from enjoying the process.<p>I know that every time I switched jobs, I was angry and frustrated with my current one and aimed for higher salary and title to compensate for what perceived slights I&#x27;ve experienced. But ultimately it was self-sabotaging as I was responding to what others deemed to be successful instead of what I wanted to do. And beforehand, I was too scared to do what I wanted to do because I always thought I needed more money, more time and have other parts of my life ready to tackle the problem; but really, I was just scared of failure.<p>But I think failure is the common lot of most folks, despite of what the VC promotion is; but if you can accept that and be happy with you just having the opportunity to work on your own thing and follow through, I personally found that more rewarding over money and arbitrary prestige.",1407386738

8146292,comment,8145785,8145785,4,0,zanny,,,"> could run 64-bit operating systems, which could address more than 4GB of RAM<p>I just want to vent how insane it is how the x86 ecosystem moved to 64 bit because <i>Microsoft refused to support physical address extensions in XP</i>. It was completely artificial, it was not a technical limitation. Hell, we really have no excuse to be on 64 bit even today - the improved integer and floating precision is nice, but few people cared about that. With PAE, you are only limited by the per-application address space... which you are <i>still</i> limited by today if you are running a 32 bit program. And in the Windows ecosystem, since there is so much less free software and no package management, everything is distributed as a 32 bit binary to be compatible across the board.<p>Which means in practice nobody ever needed 64 bit. And those that did had business reasons to do so. It is <i>true</i> that Itanium failed because Intel was ignorant of the massive inertial resistance to trying to bring tools across architectures - there is a reason OS/2 still exists, and that is just cross-OS, you can still use the same ASM at least. And you would always be surprised how many enterprise programs are ASM bound somewhere because some unholy desecration of coding practices goes on in the bowels of that non-source-controlled shared repository of suffering.<p>But I&#x27;m talking about the consumer space here - if AMD64 took off as the Xeon class of 2004 that would have been fine, but we made this transition for pretty much <i>no reason at all</i>. I have no idea why Microsoft thought making Windows 64 bit for the Vista release (there was 64 bit XP, but that was really rare and business focused) was easier than just supporting PAE.<p>But that is happening <i>again</i> today. Kind of in reverse, though. Or maybe it is just a precedent that was set? Apple has now opened the floodgates for ARMv8, and now everyone and their mother wants 64 bit buzzwords on their products while their phones still ship with 3GB of less of memory, and their architecture <i>again</i> supports PAE without issue.<p>Because there are performance ramifications here. You can fit less into your cache lines when every address takes up twice the space. There is a reason to try fitting your data in the smallest format possible. You end up with more pages in aggregate from all the wasted space, and thus consume more memory implicitly. And we never even got real 64 bit - x86 chips are still physical 48 bit, because somewhere along the lines it was realized &quot;64 bits is ludicrous amounts of memory&quot;.<p>I think the best part is that memory limitations are also solvable problems. If your program hits its memory limit (ie, a 32 bit binary with 4GB addressing) you can just fork a process instead of a thread, and suddenly you double your working space. It is insanely rare to have an active working set of more than 4GB where that data needs to be address-local available for access or else you suffer huge slowdowns, and even more so in routines where you cannot load balance to delegate processes that manage ranges of values that get that big.<p>Likewise, if you hit a kernel address limit (remember, with PAE, you can get anything from a magnitude to thousandfold increases in available physical memory) your problem is so huge it makes sense to have it worked on by a server farm compute cluster. Unless you tried to voodoo all that circuitry together into some supermassive NUMA system (sounds painful) which wouldn&#x27;t make any sense anyway because trying to abstract away network interconnects between disparate nodes at that scale has so much latency trying to treat it like memory when it is as slow as flash storage is redundant.<p>....<p>Ok, tangential rant over. I just think 64 bit is such a stupid buzzword waste of time, and its crazy that the industry has gone deep end on it for so long because it exploits some cultural tick in people that bigger is better. No, in practice it really does not &quot;hurt&quot; to have, but we (at least the consumer class, and 99% of business use cases) never needed it in the first place, really.",1407386042

Solving challenging technical problems<p>These seem like separate problems that have little to do with one another (there may actually be an inverse correlation, see below).<p>If you want to make an impact then create a product that solves a big problem for humanity. Programming has essentially nothing to do with this, other than the fact software happens to be at the core of most, but not all, products these days. You can make an impact by understanding people&#x27;s needs, coming up with a great solution, marketing it, convincing others to join you, and creating it. Programming will likely be a part of the above, but not the most important. And its importance will decrease with your product/company getting bigger (as will the impact any single programmer makes).<p>If you want to solve difficult technical problems then you can find lots of those in Computer Science research, either academic or industrial research labs. These are seriously challenging and can be fun to work on. However, I believe there is an inverse correlation between things that make an impact and things are are challenging research projects.

Why not push everyone to be doctors? Push everyone to learn virology? Surely, there&#x27;s more utility there? Why code?</i><p>This is a good question.<p>As microcolonel states elsewhere in this thread,<p><i>The point is that software literacy is becoming more relevant to everyday life. The point of a mathematics class is not to create professional mathematicians, it&#x27;s to provide the concepts of mathematics to students.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think anyone would disagree. So clearly one reason is that software literacy, computer fluency -- it&#x27;s all part of life in the 21st century. But why coding, specifically? The cynic in me raises his hand to posit that some of it may simply be a result of an unfortunately wide sense that &quot;computer stuff&quot; all lives in one big bag. And in that big bag we have pervasive entities like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple. We also have venture capital, flashy IPOs, Bill Gates, your mom telling her friend that you&#x27;re &quot;good with the computer&quot;, the aloof and touchy priesthood of IT guys at the office, the technician who fixed your FiOS, someone who made a million dollars selling an app, your cousin&#x27;s addiction to Candy Crush, Jesse Eisenberg sparring in his bathrobe over hundreds of millions of dollars, and the cryptic, cinematic, powerful -- albeit unrealistic -- representations of programming everywhere from &quot;24&quot; to &quot;The Matrix&quot;.<p>So there&#x27;s mystery and money and young people and bootstrapping and sudden shocking success. There&#x27;s little about the trades, factories, apprenticeship, slogging through an expensive education, missed opportunities, irrevocable career paths, layoffs, or two percent raises.<p>I think most people know it&#x27;s not all really that way. But it&#x27;s a powerful undercurrent. And when the manufacturing jobs evaporate, or the giant bank lays off 10,000 workers, one&#x27;s gaze can&#x27;t help but be pulled over to that big bag. Even the President&#x27;s gaze. Most people don&#x27;t understand the bag, but part of it -- this coding thing -- well, we&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s something a determined person could even pick up on their own. Maybe even at home. And hey, maybe some of those people will be mysteriously, fortuitously successful. Join the information economy. It&#x27;s a convenient place to lay some hope. It&#x27;s a pleasing, if specific, answer to the complicated question of what to do with obviated workforce cohorts. We used to have &quot;retraining&quot; and &quot;job counseling&quot;. Now we have &quot;learn to code&quot; as well.<p>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad thing. Some will find a passion or predilection, and a new direction. It&#x27;s good, but part of me believes the reasoning behind it is reductive, convenient, and wishful thinking at best.<p>Edit: clarity, words.",1407384459

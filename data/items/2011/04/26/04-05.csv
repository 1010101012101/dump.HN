I didn't mean to imply there was a direct cost comparison; just that part of your payment is for them to fund someone's paycheck. In the grand scheme of things it's definitely cheaper to maintain a high ratio of machines-under-maintenance to systems administrators.<p>That being said, the difference is Amazon pays an administrator to watch potentially thousands of machines of which you may be using a tiny fraction.  You're essentially paying for a very tiny fraction of an admin's time (somewhere) who isn't vested in your business nor does he care that your site is acting wonky. He's just answering and working through tickets (if you bought support).  Cloud providers can be come <i>markedly</i> less helpful the instant you (attempt to) deviate from the very carefully maintained cookie-cutter pattern they've set out for you.",1303793525

Netflix is genius.<p>|IANAL, but I think major laws would have to change to prevent Netflix from buying DVD titles and renting them by mail.<p>IANAL either, but I think you're referring to the First Sale Doctrine: The ""first sale"" doctrine says that a person who buys a legally produced copyrighted work may ""sell or otherwise dispose"" of the work as he sees fit, subject to some important conditions and exceptions. Section 109(a). In other words, if you legally buy a book or CD, ""first sale"" gives you the right to loan that book or CD to your friend. Libraries heavily depend on the first sale doctrine to lend books and other items to patrons.<p>Although studios and record labels could side-step this by selling the dvds as 'licenses.' Not sure though, would love a lawyer to explain this more.<p>""What remains to be seen is whether the studios will still take kindly to this sort of disintermediation.""<p>I always wonder what's keeping ESPN, Comedy Central, Cartoon Network, HBO, AMC, FX etc from just setting up websites.

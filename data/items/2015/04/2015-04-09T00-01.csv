9345176,comment,9338812,9341181,0,0,api,,,"We didn&#x27;t create mathematics from nothing. It&#x27;s a language that we created to describe certain patterns that we saw in the universe, beginning with elementary patterns such as counting and working up to things like calculus.<p>Mathematics is not unreasonably effective any more than English is.<p>Some of these patterns appear so fundamental that it&#x27;s virtually impossible to imagine them (in a detailed way) as being different. Maybe this is because our brains, being physically embodied, are constrained by these same properties of nature in terms of how they process information. We can&#x27;t picture 1+1=5 because we literally can&#x27;t think it.<p>Once you have a language with a grammar, you can <i>also</i> start exploring the &quot;pure&quot; properties of the language. Writers do this with written languages, constructing oddities like Ulysses and &quot;a rose is a rose is a rose&quot; and buffalo^8:
 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffal...</a><p>Since the language was induced from nature, exploring its structure can sometimes let you deduce very strong and powerful hypotheses about nature. But these hypotheses are not true (a.k.a. theories) until they are confirmed by experiment or observation. The combinatorial rule space of a language is so large it will contain an effectively infinite number of meaningless coincidental patterns, and Turing proved that the halting problem is undecidable so you can never be &quot;done.&quot; The inverse is also true: there will always be facts of nature that cannot be hypothesized by studying any language or logic system. This is the primary consequence of Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem.<p>TL;DR: Languages are induced to describe reality, therefore you can make conjectures about reality by playing with them. But not all such conjectures are true, and some things must be true that cannot be thus conjectured.<p>Edit:<p>Come to think of it, I am <i>not</i> certain that &quot;The combinatorial rule space of a language is so large it will contain an effectively infinite number of meaningless coincidental patterns&quot; is true, or at least I&#x27;m not aware of a proof of this akin to Godel&#x27;s theorem (wouldn&#x27;t this be the inverse of Godel&#x27;s theorem?). It could be that all theorems and patterns in mathematics (and other languages for that matter) either directly reflect something in nature or are isomorphic with something that reflects something in nature.<p>If this were true it would be impossible to make a meaningless statement that is syntactically correct in any language.

9345168,comment,9344634,9345060,0,0,encoderer,,,"Unless your timeframe is strictly intraday, I&#x27;d avoid the ETFs. In most cases the futures are trading in <i>backwardation</i> which just means that next months futures contract is more expensive than this months. So when they do the roll every month there&#x27;s a slight drag. This is the problem with leveraged ETFs but also a number of popular non-leveraged stocks like USO and UNG.<p>I&#x27;m curious why you think there will be an increase in upcoming volatility intraday?<p>My opinion as a trader is: markets are random, scalping/daytrading is a hard (some would say impossible) way to make a living. I like to trade options because there are more ways to win. I can collect theta (time) decay even if the price stays fixed.<p>If for example you think bond yields will increase, then you&#x27;re bearish on the bond market, so that view could be expressed by buying a calendar spread... eg in $TLT, sell the May $130 put and buy the July $130 put. The goal is that the May put decays in value while the long-dated put decays more slowly. Increased volatility will have an outsized effect on your long July option. You can do that trade for $192 per 1-lot.<p>But to be clear, that&#x27;s very different than scalping in and out of a position intraday.",1428540749

As explained above, hacking the video game access controls requires, by definition, hacking of the video game console or similar device in order to play the hacked video game.  Once the access controls for the video game console are hacked, regardless of the purported purpose or intent of the hacker, any content, including pirated games, can be played on a video game console.<p>> What&#x27;s more, console hackers may distribute their console-hacking solution to gamers that have no intention of using it for the purposes stated in the proposed exemption. The risk of piracy is even greater on personal computers and similar devices that do not utilize device-based access controls to prevent the installation of unauthorized software. The individual can use consoles to make and store infringing copies of copyrighted games and other content and to distribute these unlawful copies online to a large audience.<p>You can&#x27;t really go line-by-line through a 71-page comment, but it&#x27;s fair to say that that sort of rhetoric—conflating &quot;hacking&quot; with piracy with illegality, regardless of context—runs throughout, and is what my colleague highlighted here.",1428540516

It&#x27;s more accurate to say that you can&#x27;t trust a service which you don&#x27;t pay real money for. I would certainly trust a paid, dedicated cloud provider like e.g. SmugMug far more than a “free” service from a large company like Google or Amazon.<p>> Given the lowering cost of storage and out-of-the-box ease for shoving NAS boxes on a network and them popping up in a network browsing situation, I wonder if more people will return to local storage and processing?<p>That model has its own weaknesses: a single NAS box requires you to play sysadmin and is vulnerable to things like theft, accidents (never assume anything survives kids & pets!), and security problems. If enough people put everything on single systems, they&#x27;re going to start looking like great targets to the kind of people who make ransom-ware – once the attacker blocks your access to the only copy, you have no choice but to pay up!<p>An interesting project would be figuring out how to solve those problems – e.g. a box which did strongly-encrypted off-site backups with guaranteed minimum retention periods would be interesting both as a hedge against many of those threats and as a way to get the recurring revenue needed to support a serious software project with non-trivial security exposure. You could probably even open-source everything since the vast majority of people are more interested in paying someone to handle ops than saving a latte per month in service charges.",1428539250

(These opinions are a few years out of date, though.)<p>Thankfully I don&#x27;t actually care much about mobile support: I don&#x27;t use IRC for time-sensitive discussions, and for recreational purposes, trying to participate in a real-time conversation where everyone can type several times faster than you is, IMO, a pain; I&#x27;m faster at typing on iOS than I used to be, but it&#x27;s still just not comparable to a real keyboard.  Better to save the chatting for when I have one.  But I find ssh+screen an unacceptable solution: partly because of issues with notifications (i.e. out of the box, there are none) and copy+paste, though both can be fixed in theory, but mainly because of the latency.  When the letters I type don&#x27;t appear for 100ms or more, it really trips me up and I make a lot more typos.  I could find a server with less latency at home, but that wouldn&#x27;t help when traveling, especially on an unreliable connection - even though there is no fundamental reason chat should be latency sensitive in the slightest.  Tried mosh (ssh + prediction) as a compromise for a while, and it works better, but it has some issues and doesn&#x27;t fully hide the latency.<p>These days I&#x27;m using Glowing Bear, the web-based remote for weechat (that uses yet another custom protocol).  Latency&#x27;s gone, and like other web-based clients it has the neat feature of embedding YouTube videos and images, so I&#x27;m finally pretty satisfied with my IRC setup.  (And I can be paranoid about security and run it on localhost rather than using their website directly.)  But there are disadvantages: Glowing Bear is somewhat feature poor, it (again like other web-based clients) is relatively slow to render, and there is no native iOS weechat remote.  (Guess I could still use weechat as a regular bouncer, or perhaps try Glowing Bear from mobile Safari...)",1428539137

Yes, naturally race conditions will occur if process A competes with process B. Furthermore, why is a mediator performing business logic? The dispatcher / mediator / router / orchestrator seems to be presented as an active object in of itself. It really shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>Rather than manipulating or calling components from your mediator, you could tell a coordinator that coordinates services. Services are then where you&#x27;re housing your business logic. This allows you to structure these service calls and account for execution order.<p>>View initialization and render are separate steps<p>yes<p>> no events are fired during the app’s initial bootstrap/render process<p>sure<p>> on a given UI screen, a single top-level mediator takes on all responsibilities of communication/event-dispatching between subviews<p>> In practice, the code of the Orchestrator view becomes the centralized location and source of truth for all inter-widget communication in its purview<p>no?<p>There&#x27;s a reason why actor systems are a thing. You can&#x27;t just stuff everything into a central object like it&#x27;s a flat key/value store. It&#x27;s better (in my opinion) to form a hierarchy of responsibility. The &quot;Orchestrator&quot; should hire some subordinates and delegate work to them in an effective manner.<p>You guys must have an insane amount of business logic in your web app for any given UI screen (which as I&#x27;m understanding it is different menu options I guess? because otherwise a single UI screen is your entire app).

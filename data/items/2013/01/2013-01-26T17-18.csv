Human beings are selfish.<p>>Educated societies have far fewer children than non, to the point that some first world countries are losing population.<p>You're citing statistics without understanding the reason why. Education means a higher household income which has become less so during the recent economic crisis. The traditional reasoning, while crude, of why poor people have more kids is because they have less money. What they can do is have more sex because they don't have the money to do anything else.<p>We are at the point now where college grads have a hard time finding a job. How is more college grads going to solve the problem?<p>The gap has been widening in the US between the rich and middle class ever since Reagan.

Like saving critical habitat such as wetlands.<p>Etc.<p>Pretty much everything I first learned in the 90s has come true. And the actual numbers are worse than the predicted worse case scenario (eg climate change).<p>I personally believe we're past the tipping point. Meaning climate change has entered into a positive feedback loop where even if we stopped burning fossil fuels, atmospheric CO2, methane etc will continue to increase. Because of the arboreal forests continue to burn and the tundra continues to thaw and the ocean (the biggest carbon sink) continues to acidify.<p>To stop this progression or even reverse it, decades from now, humans will have to aggressively retool our industry to remove CO2 from the atmospheric.<p>Weirdly, I'm strangely optimistic.

It's a form of civil disobedience and governments don't like that, so they enact procedures that try to discourage people. If enough people opted out, the whole system would come to a stand-still and they would have to rethink the policy. That may mean just removing the option of a pat down altogether, in which case I imagine there will be a large backlash.

In fact, if you believe the Rand think-tank, ""first world"" inhabitants produce less offspring, and much of the developed world is facing a looming underpopulation crisis.<p>I know many Western European countries have a birthrate that is lower than the replacement rate.  This may be the case for America as well, but last I heard our population was still rising, with immigration also being a contributing factor.<p>In any event, you're right in that the answers don't come easy.

I have tried flippa, but havent had much luck.<p>What it does?
Dingadeal.com is aimed at groups of 8 people or more, we take the hassle away from your group trip by giving you a platform where hotels can tender for your group. Tell us some details about your trip and we will contact all the applicable hotels on your behalf ensuring that you get the best deal possible!<p>What it is has?
- Microsoft stack - asp.net/c# mvc, ms sql, azure. Html 5, javascript, jquery is also used in parts
- High quality design. 
- Inventory of hotels who are actively engaged in the site from the UK and Ireland. 
- Ranks high for certain keywords such as ""hen party in Killarney"" and ""group golfing in killarney"". 
- An SEO strategy that works and can be replicated worldwide. 
- 497 followers on Twitter
- 512 likes on Facebook
- Google+,Linkedin, youtube channel. 
- Good relationship with developers to continue development work. 
- In built room management and group payment functionality. 
- Explanation video - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1j3ylK00SU<p>What it needs? 
The current revenue model doesn't work. We rely on the group to complete the payment online when they usually need direct contact with the hotel before payment is completed. 
The ideal revenue model would be a mix between getting paid when a group completes a payment and offering hotels the option of being a ""partner hotels"". This would give them higher ranking on the results and maybe further information about the group such as the lead group members telephone number. You could also sell auxiliary services around the group trip. e.g. if a group planned on going to Killarney you could put them in touch with hotels, golf clubs etc in Killarney. These could be your ""partner golf club"" in this area. These services would pay a monthly fee for being included in the Dingadeal mails.<p>A number of websites with a similar idea have implemented revenue models that work. 
http://www.hotelplanner.com
http://www.iknow-uk.com
http://www.meetingsbooker.com<p>Who would it suit? 
Someone already in the hospitality sector, ideally if they were selling into this space they could add this as an add on to their existing product. No reason why someone who is not in this space,but with technical expertise could also make it a success.

We have to make some kind of differential equation that depends on a lot of details that I don't know. But from similar calculations I guess that a x1/3 factor is not very far from the correct number.

I'm not exactly disagreeing with you, just trying to say that moral judgement might be moot (except to one's self of course).<p>That said, we do seem to disagree on the definition of persecution. I do think people who believe in free access to knowledge, and who act on those moral principals, including pursuing transparency and accountability, are ""persecuted""... Case(s) in point: Bradley Manning, Assange, and every other whistle-blower in history. I've said it elsewhere too, but to repeat myself: it does not feel like a safe time to develop network software, and even simple things that geeks do can easily be considered threatening or criminal. No, we're not talking holocaust or even abortionist-level persecution, but geeks still get treated differently. Ex: the very real possibility of 35 years for a nonviolent, technically simple, and arguably moral, scripted download indicates how discriminating IT laws are. As others have noted, murderers get less in most states. (15 to 25 years, typically, before time off for good behavior.)

Teacher performance isn't even in the top ten.<p>A friend works on some sort of in school room surveillance system at the Gates Foundation. It records the teacher. Which is then reviewed and the teacher graded. By what criteria, I can't imagine. Then the teacher's performance is graded and coaching in administered. For improvement. I asked if any teachers were advising the project. No. I asked who reviews the tapes. Non teachers.<p>Yea, that'll help.<p>Even more standardized testing is another aspect of Taylorism. As every QA/Test person knows, you cannot test your way to quality.<p>The only measure of teacher performance is student achievement. But with so many factors beyond the control any teacher or group of teachers, it's patently unfair to judge teachers. And yet ask any faculty, group of students, or parents, and they'll tell you who the great teachers are.<p>PRIVATIZATION<p>The outsourcing of education is just a way to divert money meant for the classroom towards cronies. Standardized testing, textbooks, misc contracts are some examples.<p>The rationalization for corporate charter schools is that somehow the free market will make schools more competitive. Alas, free market means monopoly, not more parental choice.<p>Further, how is a private entity more accountable than government? I can attend board meetings, vote on levies, submit public records requests. But corporations can easily hide their activities, that's what makes them private entities.<p>THE FIX<p>I believe what's needed is more transparency, more accountability, more democracy.<p>Every single profession struggles with their bad apples. What's needed is a way to hold individuals accountable and some means of either correcting the problem or firing them. This applies to cops, doctors, accountants, teachers, everyone.<p>It's always an open secret who the bad teachers are. But just try to fire one.<p>A second friend was a principle for a few years. Of the bad apples, one of his teachers was assaulting his students. For years. My friend wasted three years trying to fire this person. Opposed by the district, the union, the other teachers, etc. Couldn't get it done. Violent teacher was a few years away from retirement, hey buddy, don't rock the boat.<p>Another friend works in the local school district. He recently related that people within the district admin were quite pleased they only ""had to fire"" 5 teachers out of 2,000+ in the last year. That's astonishing. I know there's more than 5 bad apples in the district. The documentary The Rubber Room shows what happens to bad teachers in NYC that can't be fired. (Spoiler: They all sit in a room every work day, doing nothing.) I have it on good authority that happens in every district. Probably in every profession.<p>One example from my experience: I wasn't allowed to fire 4 developers on my team. Pushed onto my team by my VP, who was building an empire. Completely toxic individuals (eg one Lebanese and one Isreali who would go at each other). No other manager would deal with them. Complete drain on my team's morale and productivity. I had numbers, facts, personal reviews in my arsenal. I couldn't fire them. I can't imagine how much harder it is in a public context.<p>But in truth, I don't know a specific fix is for culling bad apples. I believe this governance issue is the central management challenge in our society.<p>Meanwhile, I advocate for gathering more data (transparency) so that we can at least know what's going on.<p>(Thanks for reading this far.)",1359220836

Vine does nothing new but sets new arbitrary time limits on the videos they support.  Just like the others Vine will try to convince you that through focus groups they have found ""3 second"" videos will revolutionize video sharing and discovery, but this is nothing new.<p>Examples:<p>Threadlife: Supports 3 second videos
Viddy:  Supports 15 second videos  
Animoto:  Supports 30 second videos
Klip:  Supports 60 second videos<p>now Vine and its 6 second videos.<p>I am left wondering, what problem do all these video sharing apps think they are solving by setting arbitrary video time limits?  Short videos might increase likelihood a user will sit through a whole video, but contrary to what these apps want you to believe they are not improving content quality through these arbitrary time limits.  Further, time limits do not help users discovery quality content, so what problem have any of these apps solved?<p>The company that is dubbed the ""Instagram of video"" in the media is going to do the same thing Instagram did, improve content sharing and discovery.  Of course, I hope my start up is that company, but even if not I think it is safe to say the company who deserves this title will not get it for setting video time limits as a result of focus groups.<p>Disclosure:  I founded my own video sharing website with the goal to address the current problems with video sharing and discovery.

The only thing preventing you is ""being in competition"" (your words) with people who have more experience.<p>Don't compare yourself to people who have more experience. For example, if I were to pick up Computer Science today (late 30s) I would be happy to compare myself to 20-somethings who have a similar level of experience.<p>Of course, I have more life experience, hence other skills and perspective, and that is enough for me.",1359219771

Most digital timers squander their potential, but oxo gets that one right.<p>The modes make sense to me, so I see those as a plus.

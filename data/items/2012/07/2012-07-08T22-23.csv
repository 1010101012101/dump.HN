First-past-the-post elections essentially force a 2-party system, where the European style has a lot more support for smaller, side parties.<p>This isn't to say it isn't a US centric thought- honestly, I don't know enough about Europe to say definitively.

4215984,comment,4215036,4215283,2,0,fadeyev,,,"Hey AshleysBrain, author of the post here. Thanks for your comment. To address your point:<p>The users' enjoyment isn't really the issue. It is not immoral to play the game, nor to pay for it, nor to have fun doing it. The issue is whether the motivation of the creator are to build a product that gives their customers value, or a product that is effective at making money (there is a large distinction here). If your product provides entertainment, it is pretty much essential that your customers enjoy it, but the key is whether you abuse their enjoyment by turning it into addiction (which you can then exploit for your own monetary gain, e.g. drug dealers), or whether you aim to give them the best entertainment you can while keeping their consumption of it in moderation -- in other words: your primary motivation for making the product is the product itself, not the monetary reward.<p>I posit that Zynga falls into the former category, that is: their primary motivation is to make money (and I may be wrong, but this is not a wild assumption), and they achieve it by developing an addictive product. I also posit that this leads to overconsumption on the part of the users (again, not improbable). Making money isn't immoral, but exploiting another's loss for your own gain is. I am prepared to argue further about the specific example, and perhaps in doing so we may discover that Zynga do actually care about making a really great product, in which case I will be happy to retract it, but the general principle for which the specific example is given still stands.<p>At this point some will make an argument along the lines of: the responsibility for moderate consumption falls on individual users, not on the creator of the product. Now this is a very important point, but it is by no means a resolved question. I side with the camp that says that some of the blame does fall on the creator because it is only through the combination of their intentions to make the product addictive and the user's weakness that overconsumption can occur. My argument is that by choosing <i>not</i> to make addictive products -- that is, to make moral design decisions -- we can make products that benefit society rather than cause it ill.<p>This is not some moral condemnation of the creator, far from it, for I care about the creators just as much as I do about the consumers (I am one, after all), and as much as the question is about what products are good for society, it is also this: What products should we be building? What products will truly matter? What design will live on and be cherished after we die? Resolving those questions will help us develop a society we all want to live in and be proud to be a part of, both as creators and consumers.",1341788260

4215982,comment,4215118,4215682,5,0,bryansum,,,"Excellent reference. Papert created his own theory called <i>constructionism</i> based on the tenants of learning by doing and accumulated knowledge acquisition (genetic epistemology). He emphasized making learning tools meaningful and relevant to children, so that they could use their prior experiences to help model new concepts. With LOGO, children used imperatives to command a turtle around on screen. When things went wrong, children could ""act like a turtle"" to debug, often by physically acting out the commands themselves. He called it body <i>syntonic</i> learning, as opposed to the more traditional <i>disassociated</i> learning we typically see. Shameless plug: I recently wrote more about this in a review of the book ""Mindstorms"" that this was an excerpt from: <a href=""http://bsumm.net/2012/07/01/mindstorms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bsumm.net/2012/07/01/mindstorms.html</a>",1341788221

The Ruby standard library isn't that big, and Rails' libraries are named and namespaced intelligently and pretty much sit in the background without having to be explicitly invoked too much.<p>It helps that the main source of Ruby libraries is RubyGems, most RubyGems have a class or namespace named after the name of the gem, and there's a canonical source of RubyGems that doesn't allow you to use the name of gems that already exist.<p>> Well sure, exception handling shouldn't be the rule, but how often you use them isn't usually a language concern (except maybe with Java and checked exceptions). Nonetheless, when you do use them, having your IDE give you shortcuts to write the boilerplate code is a plus.<p>I guess Ruby exception handling just doesn't have much boilerplate code.",1341787964

Even then the Engineering Manager has to be hands-on.<p>This is how people work and it will not change anytime soon. Everybody needs weekly check-in with the company (represented by the manager) to stay in course.

With all the billion $s they can't come up with one more product - it's still a single trick pony.
There's Search/AdWords, everything else is pretty much failure in comparison. Maps is somewhat profitable, but it was bought from somebody else and it's pocket change next to Search. Everybody profits from Android, except Google.

It's maybe why the good isn't good enough in our lives. Anything we experience in a foreign land as being shockingly bad, or good, can show how out of touch we are with humanity, and our own humanity.<p>This begs a deeper issue.

Not the 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 star India we can buy and hide in while visiting pretending to take in the foreign eat pray love exoticness of it all.

From the shadow of it's dark past of brutal oppression of the masses by Indians themselves -- the masses were forbidden from education, learning trades, defending themselves from invaders and left to a life of subservience and suffering.

Short blog tutorials on specific topics are nice but nothing beats 150pp+ books that go into depth on certain topics.<p>Despite their utility, I can't help but wonder why there is nothing that you could call state of the art in programming eBooks. The best I've seen is Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke, which includes a built in console that allows REPL-like control of the code samples in the book.<p>It would be awesome if you had features like:<p>(1) Syntax highlighting. Bonus points if it supports standard color schemes that can be set in the eBook reader. Syntax highlighting makes code so much easier to read and understand quickly. If your eyes are used to the light on dark themes, most programming books are painful to read with their black on white code samples.
(2) Git/github integregation that permits 1-click forking of the book's source code to your account so you can try out and modify the exercises in a book, maybe even allowing branching of exercises so you can experiment at will.
(3) Built in REPL support that allows you to reset the REPL and ""play"" code samples in their entirety or up to a certain line in the sample and then freely code thereafter.<p>Ultimately, it would be great to have an eBook format that would be extremely useful on tablet devices, so you could conveniently learn new concepts on your commute or while sitting on your couch without having to bust out your laptop and set up an entire environment that is probably better suited for productivity in building something than learning.<p>I'm sure there are plenty of other features that could make programming ebooks much better and I'd love to hear from others on HN on what they would find useful.<p>Maybe someone looking for a Bret Victor ""Inventing on Principle"" opportunity will feel inspired by the ideas of others on here.",1341786556

The core lib is already extremely robust and performant; it's becoming more so every day. That's a lot of code to ignore.<p>Granted, there are still some JavaScript specific bits glued in there, but you could fork and not care about contributing decoupling-patches to ClojureScript proper.

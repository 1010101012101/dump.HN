Basically, Beats figured out how to cost-effectively profitably mass produce many variations on a common product to increase cool factor and consumer choice.<p>Given ambient noise, compressed audio, and always-imperfect listening conditions, sound quality is definitely not the first thing most consumers look for (notice I didn&#x27;t write listen for) in a set of headphones.<p>(I have decent reference headphones for the house, but elsewhere it just doesn&#x27;t matter.)",1408802156

In NYC I was always booked solid, 24/7, but in Vietnam it comes and goes in spurts.

I teach the LSAT, and chose to live in Montreal. It&#x27;s French, not a major city for English speaking law school admissions.<p>NYC is the major market. I would have been booked solid if I lived there. But I likely also would have hit a local maximum, doing lots of $200 an hour tutoring and teaching $1200 classroom courses.<p>Instead, I had to develop products to reach students in the USA.

For example, they often use top-level headings for each line from the title page, then put the entire book under the last line.  Whereas other books are closer to what you&#x27;d expect, albeit at inconsistent levels of detail.  For my project, I abandoned their TOC&#x27;s altogether and created a simpler format.<p>The images are also at a bare-minimum of resolution.  In some cases, higher-quality versions are available in the public domain (such as on Wikimedia Commons).  Most of the books are also scanned on archive.org, and so can be referenced there in facsimile.  These tend to be higher-resolution scans (although those are all monochrome that I&#x27;ve seen).<p>For corrections in the works proper, I have occasionally submitted corrections by email but never received a response.<p>Otherwise, they are perfect, and I thank them for their outstanding work.<p><i>EDIT</i>:  There are also rare cases (I think Seneca was the one I came across) where the id&#x27;s are not unique across the book, even if they are within the HTML files.  I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere in the EPUB specification that would require this, yet for practical purposes I think they should be made unique across the book, since the division into HTML files is arbitrary.<p>Further to that, there are some PG books that have a unique (serial) ID on every paragraph.  Again, this is not required, but it&#x27;s extremely helpful when it&#x27;s there (for anchor referencing).  It would make the whole library more usable if this were applied consistently, and the serial id&#x27;s are apparently mechanically applied.",1408800420

They keep electing the same politicians in D.C. (Pelosi, Reid, Boehner, Boxer, Graham, Feinstein, McConnell, McCain etc.), and constantly turn a blind eye to government abuses. Tons of leaders around the world are complicit.<p>It stands to reason, and should be unsurprising, that the vast majority of all relevant US technology companies would be complicit, seeing as they&#x27;re under direct forced compliance.<p>There is broad electorate support for what the NSA does (&#x27;keeping America safe from terrorists&#x27; - Joe Public), which is why it has escaped an incredible scandal almost entirely un-altered. It&#x27;s the same reason the Patriot Act still exists, despite the fact that you&#x27;re historically more likely to die by choking on a hotdog than at the hands of a terrorist.",1408798958

I haven&#x27;t used any of them myself, but people have developed specialized tools to make it easy for community members to contribute translations.

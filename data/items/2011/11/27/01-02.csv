The situation in the most companies is that IT is trimmed as cheap as possible, so what do people expect to happen??<p>Also, for some reason, IT departments seem to get or develop goals that are not aligned with the business. In my current place, IT is actually actively working to make the life of R&D departments harder.

There is huge profit to be made in labor replacement, with the effect of loss of jobs.<p>It is troubling that few readers pick up on the use of examples with <i>gross</i> jobs created and not <i>net</i> jobs created.  In this case, Amit Arahoni's 9 jobs created are gross, not net.  A more-clear example would be that of Craigslist.  How many jobs has Craigslist created?  Well, 30  jobs in gross, but likely a large negative number in net as it played a large part in displacing at least one entire industry (newspapers).",1322359131

I like the points about destructuring and having something like a let binding. Those seem like useful addition.<p>However, about half the post discusses how ""looping and conditional branching are conflated"", and the end focuses on adding a separate branching construct to what's supposed to be a logic-free templating language. So I guess what he's trying to say is he wants to add logic to a logic-free templating language. It seems like he missed the point of Mustache: Looping and branching are conflated <i>by design</i> to eliminate logic from the template.<p>About the only way I see the connection between Clojure and Mustache at all is through the potential value destructuring could bring, and destructuring isn't exactly a feature which is unique to Clojure (CoffeeScript, Scala, and Erlang come to mind). Otherwise this post is apples and oranges: Clojure macros are about as far as you can get from a logic-free templating language. I'm wondering if the additions he proposes are sufficient to turn what's supposed to be a logic-free templating language into a Turing-complete one (see this example of why XSLT is Turing-complete: <a href=""http://www.unidex.com/turing/utm.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unidex.com/turing/utm.htm</a>)",1322357531

Yet at the time he was CBO director, there were many people stating that CBO was distorting long term projections to show that Obama's health care bill saved money. And recently the administration appeared to acknowledge that these projections were (at a minimum) indeed inaccurate[2,3].<p><pre><code>  By scrapping the CLASS Act, HHS is losing about 40 percent \n  of the savings healthcare reform was supposed to generate. \n  The Congressional Budget Offices most recent estimates \n  projected $210 billion in total deficit reduction from the \n  healthcare law, $86 billion of which would have come from \n  CLASS.\n\n  HHS officials emphasized Friday that the healthcare reform \n  law is still projected to cut the deficit, since about \n  $125 billion of the most recent savings estimates are \n  still intact.\n</code></pre>\nNow, you can determine for yourself whether you believe HHS and CBO's other projections given that this program was found to be insolvent before it was even launched. Please also note that there was no shortage of people vociferously opposing[4] the healthcare bill before passage who called out this particular provision as unsustainable due to adverse selection effects.<p><pre><code>  The CLASS Act looks like a gift: It brings in $58 billion \n  in net tax revenues by 2019, lowering the deficit by an \n  equivalent amount because only minor costs will be booked \n  during that period. Under the CBO rules, the CLASS Act \n  technically covers one-quarter of the $250 billion \n  shortfall in funds needed to pay for health-care reform.\n\n  The gimmick lies in looking only at the CBO's ten-year \n  budget window. The extra revenues are an illusion because \n  of the disaster lurking just beyond that horizon.\n\n  In fact, none of the $58 billion is available to pay for \n  the House bill. The CLASS Act is so poorly designed that \n  the $58 billion reserve and all future premiums won't come \n  close to covering the generous benefits it's promising.\n\n  Here's why the mechanics of the CLASS Act assure its \n  eventual collapse.\n</code></pre>\nYou may disagree, but this is one relatively cut and dried example in which the critics of the healthcare bill appear to have been proven right. Indeed, evidence-laden, numerical critiques of this particular ""CLASS Act"" provision were all over the web along with charges of falsehood by Orszag.<p>Yet at the time when it might have moved the needle, Politifact was silent on this issue. This may be what OP is referring to in terms of a selection issue. They simply did not engage the CBO's projections, even though they were far more amenable to classification as ""true"" or ""false"" than standard political statements. They were also inarguably important.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/personalities/peter-orszag/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politifact.com/personalities/peter-orszag/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/health/policy/15health.html?ref=healthcarereform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/health/policy/15health.htm...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implementation/187697-hhs-to-suspend-class-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implement...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2009/09/03/news/economy/health_care_class_act.fortune/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2009/09/03/news/economy/health_care_cla...</a>",1322357101

That single policy is what ties health care to your employers-- in my mind, a kind of serfdom that keeps people tied to jobs simply because of health care insurance.<p>So getting tax equality by eliminating the deduction, or extending it to individuals, would rock the market.

By making it a Federal issue, we're just creating one giant bureaucracy and we all know how good those are at solving problems.<p>We should probably have a model like some European countries where the money follows the student and what school a student can go to isn't restricted by some arbitrary boundary on a map.<p>Likewise the tenure system has to go. What was imagined as a means of allowing academic freedom has become a recipe for entrenched mediocrity and stagnation.<p>Also, it's a problem that schools are largely funded by property taxes. This alone ensures a better education for the rich. I'm not sure what the alternative is but we need one.<p>As for healthcare, IMHO we're largely in this position because of the ""blank check"" model for health insurance and because of pharmaceutical patents.<p>Each country has different laws about what is patentable and what isn't. In the US, for example, nuclear technology is expressly forbidden from being patented as it is seen as a matter of national security. In India, health care is seen likewise so pharma patents aren't allowed, providing for cheap generic medicine.<p>I foresee a day when the US will swing in India's direction. Not that I necessarily think this is all good. The fact is, drugs are expensive to develop but it's also true that the pharmaceutical industry spends more on marketing than anything else (basically getting doctors and hospitals to use their drugs).<p>Also, litigation is a problem for health care. We all pay for outrageous punitive damage awards.<p>Lastly, it's a problem that insurance in the US is essentially tied to employment and large employers get that substantially cheaper than smaller employers (let alone individuals).<p>And of course the complexity and administrative overhead are huge problems, which is probably the one area that could be disrupted without government intervention.

There is a conflict, though: the more productive your job is, the fewer employees are necessary - actually resulting in fewer jobs.<p>Hopefully you have witnessed this first-hand over the last few decades. Travel agencies have been replaced by Priceline, Expedia, etc. Tax specialists have been replaced by TurboTax, TaxAct, etc. Even simple legal matters can be handled by LegalZoom and the like, reducing the need for lawyers. All manufactured media products (books, news, movies, music, games) are now transferred digitally, which eliminates the need for factory workers to produce physical products. Online banking eliminates the need for bank tellers. Countless other examples.<p>Essentially, technology <i>kills jobs</i>. We develop software and devices to handle what was traditionally done by people, and sell the services at a much cheaper rate because we don't have to pay for all the overhead that old services once required. This is a <i>good thing</i>, however.<p>Anyway, I'm all for immigration, and I'm all for tech companies. But the fact is they destroy jobs more than they create them, and are therefore partially responsible for the current unemployment rate. The logic behind this article is all backwards because of this.",1322355798

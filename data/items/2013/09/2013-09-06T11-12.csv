6339937,comment,6339414,6339840,3,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> I&#x27;m assuming you agree there should be some age cut off point, unless you think sex with infants is fine and dandy so long as infants aren&#x27;t looking to testify against the paedophile.<p>Just up front, the form of that argument will lose you a lot of respect.<p>Here are three approaches to sex with infants that don&#x27;t involve a cutoff age at all:<p>- Physical maturity threshold, e.g. menstruation / ejaculation.  In a sense, this is the approach we use to drinking and driving.<p>- Mental maturity threshold -- an infant is not capable of anything, and so is guaranteed to fall on the banned side of the line.  The biggest use of this kind of thing that I&#x27;m aware of is trying juveniles as adults.<p>- Just figure that nobody wants to have sex with infants. (This isn&#x27;t, in the literal sense, true; I believe the youngest documented mother was two.  However, it can easily be so-close-to-true-that-enforcement-is-a-loss-to-society.) This is the approach we use to prevent people from bombing trains, subways, museums, city buses, and pretty much everything else except airplanes.",1378468740

When roaming outside of the EU, you can still expect to get hit with massive charges for receiving voicemail.<p>It&#x27;s result of a quirk of how voicemail calls get routed: If you set up call diversion to your voicemail with your network, you&#x27;d not pay anything.<p>But if you fail to answer, or divert calls to voicemail with your phone, the calls would get routed to the network your phone is active in, you&#x27;d fail to answer, and the call would get routed back by the operator you&#x27;re roaming with, rather than having that operator somehow just signal that the calls should be diverted at source, and you&#x27;d  get to pay for the pleasure.<p>At least that&#x27;s the excuse the operators used.

It is a step in the wrong direction that the European Union gains more power to regulate the market in this fashion.<p>The reason operators are able to charge for roaming as they do, has a lot to do with the fact that the telecommunication business isn&#x27;t a free business. Currently only a select few in each country who are paying a large licensing fee are allowed to set up the different types of networks (GSM, UMTS etc). 
What is happening is you grant special benefits to the operators, so they are working in a protected environment. Of course they are going to charge extra if no-one is there to bid lower.<p>What the EU is doing right now is trying to fix a symptom created by an already wacky system that their member states have created themselves.",1378465505

That being said, competition at least around here for mobile/3G is extremely healthy, prices have come down year on year and the choice/availability has gone up.<p>What I fear would happen if this went into force is that many (all?) of the smaller operators would go out of business overnight as they couldn&#x27;t find a network within all continental european countries who will roam for them at a reasonable price.<p>Then you&#x27;ll have Orange/Vodafone/etc who own a lot of the infrastructure across europe leverage that so essentially they&#x27;re the only competitive player and get to set the prices however they want. They&#x27;ll sell their subsidiaries roaming at X and their competition roaming at X*1,000.<p>Just look at the US: Their networks are inter-state, and as a result of having to cover such a large landmass it is almost non competitive.

IMHO that is one problem with the age of consent: There need to be exceptions for cases where both teenagers are about the same age.

The EU is largely about breaking the borders between all these smaller countries and making trade and travel between these countries easier for EU members. Although the ease of trade and travel have certainly improved massively (no more need for passport controls, one currency for the Union), I think these mobile roaming costs are actually quite a big problem.<p>In the current situation, as a customer, when I&#x27;m on holiday in another EU country I have three options for using my iPhone on the go:<p>1) Shelling out for roaming costs, which are expensive, extremely untransparent, and seem very arbitrary. What are these costs for? Who determines what the right price is?
2) Buying a SIM-card in the country of my destination, which is cheaper but also prevents me from using my own phone number while abroad
3) Not using mobile data at all and hoping for free WiFi at my hotel or in the nearest village (which is what I do)<p>Removing roaming costs altogether means I can freely drive to France for a two-week holiday and use Google Maps or check my email on my iPhone, all within my normal data bundle, without the risk of getting a bill of a few hundred Euro.",1378465241

I know because these are some of the methods I have used over the years to make money online. I'm going to reveal some of the methods you/your friends can make money with $0 outlay because these are the easiest ones to get them started:<p>- Create FREE Wordpress Themes & sell the sponsored links in the footer = $75  150/theme (You can code HTML to Wordpress with ~30ish lines of Code although adding extras takes a little more but it really is that simple).<p>Sell 3 slots on each design for: $20-25/each<p>Sell the designer slot by for: $30-50/each<p>Offer the whole theme for: $100-150<p>Then submit the theme to 100-150 free theme places (you could even pay someone on Fiverr to do it)<p>- Sell Wordpress Themes on ThemesForest<p>$30  50/each<p>- Sell Wordpress Plugins<p>- Code PSD/HTML etc<p>Offer your services for $30-100/page & charge $50-100 extra to code to Wordpress etc.<p>- Write an eBook report<p>Write a report on some aspect to making money online etc & sell it for $7-10 on Webmaster Forums.<p>- Write a Larger eBook. Sell it on Warrior Forum/ClickBank.<p>Write a 10-20 page eBook then sell it on Warrior Forum as a WSO or on ClickBank etc.<p>- Write Articles<p>500/word articles at $6-8/each.<p>- Bid for Data Entry/Web Development/Mobile Development on 
Freelance Sites<p>Take small tasks which are easy to do & take a short period of time - $100-200 projects.<p>- Create Mobile Sites
Charge $100-500 for making existing website owners a simple mobile version of their site.<p>---<p>There's loads more but there's some quick examples to make some cash online with $0 outlay. Once they're making money online then the question is what to do next (in my opinion those methods are boring although paid Wordpress Themes etc aren't that bad of a business). The possibilities are endless and again I'll be happy to list some of those as well because some of those methods get boring after a while!",1362095954

Someone willing to sacrifice themselves for a greater, to defend those who can't defend themselves, to bring honor to their service. A US soldier serves the people first, the government second. Manning realized the risk he was placing his life in, and like a true soldier, he didn't let that knowledge deter him.

When things go wrong (and they do, it's only natural) I painstakingly pull them apart to make sure we know why things went wrong, at what part they went wrong and how we can stop or at least spot in advance the possibility of things going wrong that way again.<p>I've driven customer service to be the number one thing about all customer interactions with my company. I don't just want my customer to be happy, I want them to be backflipping in the streets happy. It's a high goal to aim for, but I feel it's an area we can strongly compete in.<p>The other two areas I'm passionate about are customer acquisition and retention. I push our sales team to provide more handholding and pre-sales support for a service company than similar companies we compete with - again, this is a customer service thing and for us service starts at the point of contact, not when the invoice gets paid (which usually comes at the end in my line of work).<p>Don't get me wrong, the author wrote what works for them, but I felt a lot of the things (like ""Work only with the best people"") are quite harmful, you're not always going to have the option for the best people, and they're not always the people that work best. Likewise the ""be on a purposeful mission"" sounds insincere to me.

If you truly believe in your actions, you take responsibility, no matter the consequences.  Such is how many in the war of independence saw it.  They knew that if the British caught them, they'd likely be tried as traitors.  Not saying all revolutions are have 'honorable causes'.

I'm not sure why anybody would think that using transform in a javascript callback loop would be faster than setting top/left in a javascript callback loop. However, it's obvious why using tranform and css animations would be faster: there's no javascript loop required.<p>If animating in javascript, every frame requires a new javascript turn, and every frame requires crossing the js/native bridge. Theoretically it should be faster to cross the bridge only once, which is possible when using translate because both x and y can be set in one crossing of the bridge, wheras setting top and then setting left requires crossing the bridge twice. However the cost of setting up and tearing down the turns required to do the animation in js would dwarf any tiny advantage gained by only crossing the bridge once instead of twice.<p>However if you instead simply use a transform with a duration and set the x and y to the final value instead of manually setting all the intermediate values, it's obvious why things should be much faster: there are no longer any js turns required to carry out the entire animation other than the first one where you set it up, and there's no bridge crossing required except for the first one, either.<p>Did I miss something here? Why would the author think that setting transform in a loop would be faster than setting top/left in a loop? They are basically equivalent.

I am curious to know which FAOstat data they used. Was it Sugar, Raw Equivalent or Sugar, Refined Equivalent? Either way, the FAO data is calculated based on production + imports - exports. They admit in the paper itself that this is not a perfect proxy (""It is thought that much of the FAO data on foods and nutrients in the food supply have limits to their reliability"") for consumption so it is alarming, but predictable to see this being termed as such by the media.<p>I don't know if it's the best series of data to use for this. I would have used a much longer series if possible because to be honest the past ten years have not seen a dramatic change in sugar consumption,  but I guess their diabetes prevalence dataset only spanned that long. But that brings up the question of the lag for developing diabetes itself, it's not like 50 extra calories. I also couldn't find if they threw out countries with weird or obviously low quality data. Israel's data, for example, is a bit strange. It goes from around 500 kcal/capita/day sugar to 230. I find it hard to believe that consumption habits changed so drastically there.<p>They also do not discuss much about why they, as non-economists, chose to use econometric rather than epidemiology or biostat methods. I also hate that their final graph is totally unlabeled and there is no option to download a format that would allow one to see which dots correspond to which country.<p>It would be wise for some of the alarmists on this thread to read the paper and this sentence in particular "" Hence, any of the findings we observe here are meant to be exploratory in nature, helping us to detect broad population patterns that deserve further testing through prospective longitudinal cohort studies in international settings, which are only now coming underway.""",1362093408

The toggle from ""alpha"" to ""euro"" seemed like a neat feature at first, but it's of course completely un-suited to fast typing.<p>Likewise, compartmentalizing typing into various groups (alphabetic chars, accented chars, capitalized chars, symbols, punctuation, etc.) is logical, but mostly incompatible with just about any modern keyboard workflow.<p>edit : after doing some further reading, I realize I was judging it based on a completely incorrect set of criteria. It's intended purpose was for non typists, single-hand typing or ""environments where conventional two-handed keyboarding does not work"" [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/keyboard.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/keyboard.html</a>",1362092568
5301700,comment,5295034,5296026,1,0,smsm42,,,"PHP arrays store zval . The reason for it has to do with references - basically, if you want to do $a =& $b; and then $a = 1 and want for $b be 1 now too, if symbol table for b is storing zval , there's no way to change it when $a = 1 is executed. However, if b's entry stores pointer to actual zval , and so does a's entry, when you change that storage to point to zval with 1 instead, both $a and $b would change. Hope I explain it clearly, hard to do it without drawing a picture :)<p>So, to receive zval , you need to pass zval  to the hash function. That's why the type in general is void , because generic hash (hashes are used for all kinds of things, not only zvals) stores void , so to receive it you pass void .<p>Just for fun, there are places in the code IIRC where quadruple pointer can be found (see zend_fcall_info_args_save for example). Pretty rare case though, don't remember any place with five-times pointer.",1362092554

5301694,comment,5300603,5301503,3,0,sprobertson,,,"Here's what I think they mean: without Scss/Sass extension, to get your main div to be 4 columns wide you have to do something along the lines of `<div class=""four columns""> ...`. With the ability to extend other classes, you could instead be more semantic and define your div as `<div id=""main""> ...` and in your Scss file say `#main { @extend columns; @extend four; }`.<p>I'd personally stick with the presentation classes for most cases though. The templates likely do it this way so you can just throw the Foundation CSS on and it's ready to go.<p>EDIT: Thinking more about it, I think a huge advantage is that if you had an already-structured HTML file, you could write up a few @extend rules and apply a grid without having to add classes to everything. (You could use this technique to quickly throw up a grid for something like <a href=""http://csszengarden.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csszengarden.com/</a>)",1362092480

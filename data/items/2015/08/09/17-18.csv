So here&#x27;s my question:<p>What is the best Linux sandbox available right now?<p>Even better if it&#x27;s something simple to use and battle tested. Main things I would like to sandbox is Firefox, Thunderbird, Wine, Torrent stuff and maybe Chrome (is it necessary? my chrome://sandbox shows YES to everything except &quot;SUID Sandbox&quot;)",1439143177

Not as many as you think.  The Veyron was Ferdinand Piech&#x27;s moonshot.  It was the automotive Concorde.  The physics involved are <i>sort of nuts</i>[1], especially when you consider it was developed in the late 90s and went into production over a decade ago.  The R&D costs were ludicrous.  They nearly burnt down the engine design building because the immense heat the engine spewed out on the test rig... yet still had to find ways to dissipate that much heat in actual use.  It was considered an engineering and research exercise that could defray some of its costs.<p>This isn&#x27;t much different.  New automotive production line and models costing serious money up front?  I&#x27;m going to die from a lack of surprise.<p>[1] <i>Consider a valve stem cap.  They&#x27;re aluminum, and weigh ~1g.  However at near 400kph, because of the centripetal force of the wheel, they effectively weigh 7.5kg at those speeds.  They also had to redesign the schrader valves so they wouldn&#x27;t deflate at those speeds.  They also had to create new TPMS sensors because even Porsche&#x27;s -- which were rated for around 350kph -- damn near disintegrated past 375kph.</i>",1439142846

Uniqueness.  What someone like me might call flaws.<p>My Toyota van is gonna be way more reliable than a Maybach Landaulet.  It can haul more, too.    Hell, if I got a more expensive Toyota, say, one of the faster lexus LS models that is more in the shape of the Landaulet,  it wouldn&#x27;t even be much any slower, and the LS is, if not affordable, at least realistic for your average silicon valley tech nerd.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that a Lexus LS really compares to a Maybach Landaulet  in the market or in people&#x27;s minds;  it doesn&#x27;t.  One is like $70K and the other is like one and a half million.    But the strongest objective advantage the Maybach has is simple exclusivity;  There are a lot of Toyotas on the road;  a lot of the value in the Maybach is in the process... and the process that makes it rare.<p>Objectively, I would easily argue that the Maybach is worse.  It&#x27;s going to be vastly less reliable than that Lexus.   and certainly, for telling time, your $10 drug store watch is vastly superior to your hand-built analog wrist-art piece.<p>And if you want to get fancy, even the cheapest cellphones these days come with time synced from GPS satellites.

One of those things where the more you learn about how it works, the more amazed you will be that it works ever at all.)<p>So... yeah, I&#x27;m not saying there isn&#x27;t value in having a hand-built art-piece; sometimes, there&#x27;s a whole lot of value.  And if you&#x27;ve got that much money, why do you really care what time it is, anyhow?

Aspirations drive people.<p>I think there is a saying something like &quot;the difference between men and boys is the size of their toys&quot;.<p>And in fact many of those &quot;toys&quot; don&#x27;t matter once you get older simply because you are in a different place in life with different needs and outlook. Can&#x27;t imprint that thought pattern when younger and quite frankly why would you? What fun would that be?<p>I remember when I was in my 20&#x27;s I was able to afford a really nice car one that I had always wanted in my teens.  About a week after getting the car I was very aware of the fact that I wasn&#x27;t any happier than I had been prior to getting the car (and actually thought I would be) and maybe even a little less so (anticipation effect if you want to call it that). I was still glad that I got the car though and have always had nice cars since and never regretted it. But part of my motivation has changed. Back then it was to get a girl by having a nice car and to impress people (used to be like that, the &quot;get a girl&quot; part many older folks will tell you). Now I like it just because its a nice thing to have. And in some cases having nice things helps with business as well in the bricks and mortar world at least.. I can tie a few deals to the fact that I drove a nice car. Plus getting random comments from strangers does provide a boost.<p>As you get old you do become more mellow because you can be more mellow. Because in many cases you have either &quot;arrived&quot; or your needs have changed. The kids college is already taken care of and all of that, have a vacation place, nice house and so on.<p>But don&#x27;t think for a second that it would be possible to &quot;not care&quot; &quot;now&quot; if the effort hadn&#x27;t been put in earlier to insure at least some financial security. And I am not talking about living richly either. But having enough that you don&#x27;t have to be concerned with money is a nice thing don&#x27;t let anyone tell you differently.",1439142000

Rereading The Jungle recently, I again found the second half almost unbearable, especially the later chapters which devolve into clumsy, thinly-veiled socialist propaganda.&quot;<p>This appears to be precisely the reaction to The Jungle which Upton Sinclair complained about; he wrote the book to illustrate the harshness and exploitation of poverty, but everyone got hung up on the descriptions of meatpacking instead. Not on the conditions of the meatpackers, mind you, but on the conditions of the meat (&quot;Oh no, not my food!&quot;)!

This isn&#x27;t really a limitation, though, because the desire to store huge BLOBs in your version control system alongside C++/etc source is utterly confused.  For large, undiffable assets like that, you want to keep them in a permanent store, kind of like the  way the gnu.org keeps the tarballs for its multitude of projects.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why absolutely nobody uses Perforce for personal projects, even though the license to do so is free.  It&#x27;s because Perforce&#x27;s day, if it ever had one, is long gone.  It&#x27;s just an attractive nuisance now.",1439140492

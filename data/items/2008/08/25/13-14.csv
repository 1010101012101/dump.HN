285887,comment,285399,285797,0,0,jsrn,,,"here is the full transcript of the Times Magazine interview with Putin:\n<a href=""http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/printout/0,29239,1690753_1690757_1695787,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/printout/0,29239,1690...</a><p>it's pretty interesting, actually. For example, Putin is   \noften quoted with saying that the Collapse of the Soviet   \nUnion was the ""biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the (last) century."" Without context, that sounds like strange, if not downright dangerous thinking to western ears. But it also can help our understanding how the collapse and the chaotic 90s were perceived by the Russians themselves:<p><pre><code>  TIME: Were the 1990s a time of paradox for you?\n  On the one hand, you say it gave you the Gorbachev\n  freedoms; on the other hand, in your statements you\n  have stated that there was a period of total collapse\n  and the tragedy of the destruction of the Soviet Union. \n\n  PUTIN: I don't see a paradox here. The administrative\n  planning system that prevailed in economic life, and the\n  complete domination of the Communist Party in the \n  political area, resulted in a collapse of the country.\n  When people no longer cared about the state they lived in, \n  they didn't need such a state, therefore there was no\n  surprise that the people couldn't care less about that\n  state. They believed that things couldn't get any worse,\n  but it turned out that they could, and did. The tragedy is\n  that people were utterly dissatisfied and disillusioned\n  because the free-for-all was declared as democracy, the\n  theft of billions of dollars was described as the free\n  market and the theft of enormous assets belonging to the\n  people were declared privatization. What did the collapse\n  of the Soviet Union mean? Twenty-five million Soviet \n  citizens who were ethnic Russians found themselves beyond \n  the borders of new Russia. Nobody gave thought to them.\n  Twenty-five million would make up a major European nation.\n  Before taking a decision, one should consult the\n  population. Do you want to live separate from the state\n  you live in now? I'm confident that if we were to hold a\n  referendum in many of the former Soviet republics, the\n  vast majority would say no. But nobody asked them. Was\n  that a democratic solution? Of such a difficult problem?\n  Well, we're not trying to revisit this but that was so.\n  Who asked us or them? Twenty-five million Russians found\n  themselves outside the Russian Federation, without any\n  economic means, amid growing local nationalism. When they\n  couldn't possibly come to the new Russia, to their\n  historical motherland, because they didn't even have money\n  to buy a train or a plane ticket. Is it not a tragedy?</code></pre>",1219672066

If I look up, say, ""Succinctness is Power"", which should bring up PG's essay on his web site, Yandex instead retrieves a bunch of pages that mention the article and also Russian translations rather than the original. So the user is left thinking that the original is not even on the web (unless she carefully examines the links on web pages that pop up in the result set).<p>They were clever enough to index en.wikipedia.org, although it is usually not at the top for some very obvious requests (e.g. try ""Turing Machine""), which is an indication of a rather poor ranking system.<p>My impression is, Yandex does not compete with Google in any way. Despite its slogan (""Everything can be found"" or something like that) it's just a limited web index that doesn't even state explicitly about its limitations.

Alternatively, you can list your tags with things to push, like<p><pre><code>  git push origin master my-tag ...\n</code></pre>\nThat might also work with --all.  If it does, you could get away with:<p><pre><code>  git push --all origin my-tag\n</code></pre>\nAs for the rest...I'm not sure what your best way forward is.  One way might be simply to don't delete branches.  They'll clutter the list of branches, but so what?  Just ignore them if you don't use them.<p>The 'git remote prune' way is probably best.  Run that, and then check for local branches that aren't tracking a remote.  That's scriptable.<p>I don't think there's a simple and elegant answer here, because what you're doing basically turns Git into subversion.  That's pretty much unavoidable when one is doing what you're doing.<p>You could be more ""distributed"" if you only worked on specific features or modules (or whatever) at specific locations.

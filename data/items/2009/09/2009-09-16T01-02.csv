825176,comment,824770,825061,0,0,jerf,,,"But the long term trends are clear: Centralized players lose to decentralized services. If you think that's not true, you need to broaden your perspective and look at more history. All those centralized services you see today? Those aren't the trend, those are the <i>remnants</i> of the stacks upon stacks of corpses of centralized services destroyed by decentralization, the only things still standing. From email, through RSS, and through Twitters eventual decentralized replacement, the march has been relentless.<p>What reason do you have to think that a pattern in place for decades is suddenly going to stop because Mighty Twitter is just so damned <i>special</i>? Think in historical terms, across the decades, and Twitter is little more than a blip in the trend. I'm sure Twitter is going to make some money before it goes, but I'm also sure there won't be a Twitter in ten years, but instead a protocol. Same for Facebook, incidentally.<p>Centralization is O(n^4) to decentralization's O(1.1^n); sure, it looks like centralization is just <i>awesome</i> for a while, but it always ends up stomped flat in the end.",1253066342
825175,comment,823925,824175,0,0,moe,,,"<i>Especially with WebGL and O3D in the works we will see the browser become the delivery mechanism for the new-old-school fat client.</i><p>I'm sorry but I fail to see what 3d technology in the browser has to do with application UIs. The two fundamental problems with HTML are the complete failure that is the box model, and the W3Cs complete ignorance of real world requirements.<p>As an example for the latter just look at the pityful HTML widget-set that hasn't changed one bit over the last 15 years. Every OS GUI toolkit in existence has native widgets for comboboxes, date pickers, sliders and various other amazingly useful primitives. I don't see any plans for finally bringing any of that to HTML. Instead we'll continue to see every new javascript framework reinvent them to varying degrees of success, along with a long list of other baseline functionality (client-side form validation, anyone? WebSocket really soon now?).<p>All the while the W3C invents fancy audio/video tags, 3d widgets, a questionable canvas API and lots of other stuff that hardly solves any real problem we developers are fighting every day, in <i>any</i> app.<p>I don't think the evolution of RIAs will wait for the W3C to get their act together. I rather think the alternatives to the browser will see a raise in popularity in the foreseeable future, as the HTML/JS combo gets maxed out and more people start looking for ways to notch the expirience up further than possible within the browser constraints...",1253066282

825172,comment,824332,824954,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>am I reading it right that there was virtually no variation in skin color 20,000 years ago?</i><p>I think the correct statement is as you say in another part of your post: there has always been variation in skin color in the human population. It was geographically segregated (forming ""races"" in the biological sense) only very recently. And even today there is a lot of variation among individuals in skin color within each continental subpopulation of human beings.<p>The usual view of evolution of skin color is that the ancestral condition was white skin under dark hair (as we still see in chimpanzees). Then at some unknown time, human ancestors became less hairy, and darker skin pigmentation became necessary. Then as human beings (Homo sapiens) migrated to latitudes with less sunlight (VERY recently) gene frequencies changed again in favor of lighter skin in some areas. (Inuit people are quite dark skinned for people who live near the North Pole and usually wear heavy clothing.)",1253066180

825153,comment,824770,825081,0,0,pyre,,,"Decentralized doesn't mean client-side. Think about it this way: What if Twitter wasn't a centralized company, but a standard protocol for software running on servers to communicate with each other?<p>Each user would run their own 'microblog' on a server somewhere. When someone 'followed' them, they would end up subscribing to an RSS/Atom but in a way that was more similar to rssCloud or PubSubHubBub (i.e. the user1 wants to follow user2 so user1's software registers a 'callback url' with user2's microblog; now when user2 publishes, an update is pushed out to user1's microblog software)<p>Users wouldn't even necessarily have to fool around with 'hosting packages.' This opens up a market for companies to provide 'targeted hosting' (hosting of a particular software package) or to create their own software package that conforms to the basic tenets of the protocol while adding things onto the interface (like games/advertisements/quizzes/etc). So the 'average user' wouldn't necessarily have to get their hands 'dirty' trying to figure out the difference between Shared Hosting and a VPS.<p>You can have servers in a decentralized setup. The whole point is that there isn't a single point of failure (in this case Twitter or Facebook). Not only that, people could (presumably) have better access/ownership of their own data and be able to back it up in case of disaster (in which case they could restore everything back to normal or migrate to a different server/service).",1253065213

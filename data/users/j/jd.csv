Some say that the best way to grow a start-up is for the founder to hire the talent he or she does not possess. In my case, that talent-deficiency list is long. But following that advice, AmericaSpace has evolved into a space news outlet with 15 very talented people. It is they who make it hum and have through their hard work built viewership to 60K unique visits monthly.<p>I am the founder and co-organizer of CocoaCoder.org, a group founded in 2003 to promote Mac OS X, and later iOS, application development. It has over 420 members. CocoaCoder.org meets weekly and presents on both hard and soft topics.<p>In 2000-2001, I worked at JPL, Section 312 as a C++ programmer. If I can say I hate a programming language, then C++ would fit that description.<p>In 1993-1996, I was co-founder of HouseWorks, an Austin, Texas based gaming company.

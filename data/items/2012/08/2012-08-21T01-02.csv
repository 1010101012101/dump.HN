4410756,comment,4410579,4410579,10,0,vacri,,,"Meh, the title is not what this declaration is about. The meat of the declaration is this line ""<i>The absence of a neocortex does not appear to preclude an organism from
experiencing affective states</i>"", which in layman's terms means 'you don't need a fancy brain to have self-awareness'.<p>(actually 'affective states' means 'emotions' in laymans terms, but in this given context, it's meant to mean 'self-awareness')<p>It's clear from the document that they already consider primates, cetaceans, and elephants to be in the 'self-aware' group with humans. This has generally been accepted for some time, both from the angle of behavioural studies and that of comparing the complexities of brains. What this declaration is really about is recognising the rather surprising result that some birds can do the behavioural part while not having a similarly complex brain.<p>Some of the other stuff in the declaration is incredibly humdrum and clearly visible to a layman. Animals are known to experience emotions - seen a happy or scared dog? An angry bird defending it's nest? The question of whether animals experience <i>emotion</i> is different to the one of <i>self-awareness</i>. Similarly, it's obvious that pharmaceutical compounds affect animal awareness - because vets use things like that all the time to sedate animals for surgery. Or if you want mood-altering evidence, check out catnip. Euphoria? vets have drugs for that too.<p>The only new thing here is ""we recognise that self-awareness can be present in birds, which means that you don't need a fancy brain (neocortex) to have it"". The stuff about emotion not necessarily being in the neocortex is very old hat, and was in textbooks when I did my degree nearly 20 years ago.<p>Personally, I'm also not fond of 'consciousness' to mean 'self-awareness' or perhaps 'sentience', because it conflates heavily with anaesthesiology. A vet can knock a dog out for an operation, after which it regains consciousness, but not consciousness, because while it was conscious before the operation, it wasn't conscious... :)",1345513660

What else could feel things like we do? This is a poor way of attacking the problem though, we only know what we (internally, as an individual person) experience. We never really question when someone says 'I'm happy'. What if it feels like something completely different? It's easier to hear 'happy' and relate to how we feel 'happy'. But that's not necessarily true.<p>We stand at the top of a pyramid, wondering if other animals, plants, forests, ecosystems, planets can experience. Think of someone who views the world entirely differently than you with essentially the same genome. Now think of what makes them happy, sad, how they see a piece of technology, what they think of when they're alone, or with their best friends, hard right? Now imagine you are completely different species, or groups of species working together, you will never, ever know what kind of experiences could be felt inside the 'mind' of a planet, or a forest).<p>It's odd thinking that people still hold the belief that humans are the only beings privy to a consciousness, we barely know what that word even means.",1345513638

Even worse - your only S3 machine could get blacklisted, and I don't see why operators wouldn't share blacklist the way it's done to fight spam.<p>So my suggestion is to have multiple alternatives instead, as in lines of defense.<p>First, a simple SSH server also running a socks and a http proxy is useful. Easy to reach and configure - some browser work better with http proxy (or was it sock? Opera only supports one but I can't remember which at the moment)<p>In the second line, you want to run the SSH server on a nonstandard port as the author does. I suggest multiplexing the port : simply run SSLH on both port 80 and 443, with the patch published on <a href=""http://rutschle.net/pipermail/sslh/2012-April/000202.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rutschle.net/pipermail/sslh/2012-April/000202.html</a><p>But that will not look like a standard SSL connection. Even worse, if you use your own certificate - operators could deny all self-signed certificates.<p>So get stunnel running on port 443 with a ""usual"" certificate instead, and pass the traffic on port 80 where you'll be happy to have SSLH or whatever you prefer - like Openvpn which can do port sharing or which can be put ""behind"" stunnel and sslh, so that you will use a standard 443 port, and do a genuine SSL connection on that port. Much better. Have some fun with burst.net - they offer you 2 IP for like $7/month : you can do some routing and give the 2nd IP address to your laptop on the other end of the tunnel. Now <i>that</i> is freedom :-) Every port will be opened in both ways :-)<p>Still, I do not believe anything of that will be enough to resist to statistical analysis. I've seen interesting tools, but if I down to that I'd better use a standard DNS tunnel (iodine, dns2tcp, ntsx, whatever).<p>Once again, multiplexing port 53 could be good to have them on different subdomains (you never know which tool you'll have on hand, or can easily recompile on the go) or to run a standard DNS server too (named, maradns, ...).<p>It will be a good idea to ""rate limit"" one of them because having too much traffic flow on port 53 to a given IP is something that stands out. (And I have seen DNS tunnels broken by a simple rate limit rule)<p>I found something interesting to multiplex DNS request in C, which name I don't remember at the moment. If anyone is interested I can dig that up.<p>Finally, deploy all that setup on at least 2 machines, using different domains and different subnet so that if one of your ""lines of defenses"" goes down (ie get blacklisted) you can safely move to the next one.<p>Total time it takes : 2 hours, then you'll always have a way out of a locked connection.",1345513041

4410718,comment,4409157,4410125,4,0,zaphoyd,,,"Assuming you arent CPU or memory limited, the bottleneck was originally largely due to gigabit Ethernet's support of unswitched hubs and as such uses CSMA to detect collisions. In order for this to work there is a minimum transmit timeslot to ensure that collisions can be detected at the full round trip delay of a ~100m network.<p>Effectively a 1Gbit Ethernet node must transmit at least 512 bytes during its timeslot. If it has that much to send then it all goes out at 1gbit. If it only has a few bytes to send (a tcp ack for example) then it must idle for a bit to make sure there wasn't a collision.<p>In theory gigabit Ethernet should perform at 1gbit for sustained transfers but much worse for workloads with more sporadic sets of smaller packets. In practice, especially on core switches and routers, modern techniques like frame bursting (sending multiple small packets going to the same destination back to back) even things out more.<p>10gbit Ethernet and above get rid of the carrier sense collision detection support all together and require the entire network to be point to point with switches. It has no minimum timeslots or packet lengths.",1345512961

4410665,comment,4407950,4410339,2,0,Kell,,,"Well. You actually cast some doubts on my knowledge of French procedural law... so since, France is a civil law country I went to the Code de Procdure Pnale. So small class about what happen when a Judge d'Instruction (which in France is an independent judge who is charged of preparing the case to be judged in a formal court. But only on serious crimes affairs, or when it's a complex affair. So it's like an ""expert"" prosecutor for serious cases which job is not to actually prosecute... but to really gather the evidence for a fair trial (he has the mission of searching evidences for and against the suspect) I will use JI to refer to this judge) want to speak to someone.<p>3 cases :<p>1 - The person is not seriously suspected of being the perpetrator of the crime investigated. He can be forced to present itself to the JI if the JI wants it. Then he will be considered a <i>witness</i>. This is Art. 101 of the CPP (Code of Penal Procedure) In the case of an external impossibility (meaning that it's not just the guy not wanting to come) the JI can actually go to the witness or hear the witness by any mean (Art. 109 CPP). So even if you are a just a witness you can be forced to come.<p>2 - An assisted witness Art.113-1 CPP (that's when there is some possibility that you are going to be indicted because you are a suspect), the difference is that an assisted witness has the right to have a lawyer, more rights etc.
If you have been identified at least by name by the victim, then you must at least be this. So at least. Assange would have been an assisted witness. It's true that an assisted witness has the right to ask is own indictment, and the JI must comply (Art. 113-6 CPP). BUT, to have the assisted witness status you must have been heard at least once by the JI. Force can still be used to present to assisted witness to the JI, and in case of impossibility etc. etc.<p>3 - Indicted (Mise en examen). A lot of rights, but also much much much more power to the JI investigating the case. And well, the indictment defined at the 80-1 and 80-2 CPP is quite clearly possible after a face to face interview between the JI and the suspect : Translation by myself ""The indictment can only happen after the first <i>interview</i> of the person in front of the JI""...<p>I could go on explaining the fine details of this law... but I think you got the picture.<p>Oh, and about your ""string of cases""... I'm really sorry to say it... but you totally misinterpreting them. I mean... radically.<p>See Walser v. France => The problem was that the plaintiff in this case was arrested to be presented to a JI, she (the plaintiff) was then held in custody of the police for more than the legal 48h (58:30 actually) and the only had her first meeting with the JI and was then indicted, benefiting of all rights and protections of the indicted (a lawyer, access to the role of events and her own file etc.). The ECHR says it right away, the problem was the lack of due diligence by the police, not the arrest in itself. The European Judges said that the maximum time to be detained before a presentation to a prosecutor is 48h outside of extraordinary situation (Like the case I cited of Medvedyev v. France, where since it was an extraordinary situation (Medvedyev and all where caught in the middle of the ocean 10 days away from the nearest French coast, so they said that since they where presented right away to a judge after landing, it was legal).<p>So clearly the Good Court of Strasbourg is not objecting the  fact that the suspect was forced to surrender to French police to be then questioned by the Judges and Prosecutors. The Wise Court is saying that police waited too long and thus abused authority. And French law was modified accordingly, creating the articles 803-2 803-3 in the CPP saying that the suspect must be presented in the legal time and quicker possible.<p>Oh... but maybe you're referring something happening at a totally different moment in the procedure. Yeah... you know, the act of surrender as a prisoner... <i>just before a supreme court trial if, and only if he had been judged guilty by the appellate court</i>. Nothing to do with the indictment, the investigation and everything. It's only that French law required that if an appellate court said you were guilty and sentenced you to a prison sentence, then you had to first go beyond bars to be able to require an appeal in front of the supreme court. This element of law has been deleted of French law in 2000, yes. But has nothing at all to do with the present case. And as I show, the Court is perfectly fine with authorizing the police to arrest people so they can be presented to a judge to be indicted and then investigated, which is exactly what is going on here with Assange... This cases are filled in the Access to a Tribunal Rights at the ECHR books, not the rights of persons being investigated.<p>TL;DR:
Omar and etc. are cases concerning the fact that in France before 2000 if you where sentenced to prison by an appellate court, you had to surrender yourself to the police in order to be able to appeal to the Supreme Court. If you were on the run, your lawyer couldn't file an appeal to the Supreme. But this has nothing to do with the present case. Since Assange already filed complaints in Sweden about decisions by the prosecutors and etc. And the ECHR is perfectly fine with an arrest in investigations, provided it is to present the suspect to a prosecutor or judge (and some other cases also).<p>Finally : Assange has a fundamental right to file appeal even if he is on the run. But the prosecutors have the right to ask police to bring Assange by force if he denies coming willingly.<p>----
Now speaking of the other comments you made :
----<p>On the subject of respect of the rule of law by Sweden and UK, you are right. Nothing impedes UK and Sweden than become worse than China on that matter. BUT, frankly... that kind of thing does not happen out of the blue. Guantanomo and Pvt Manning is out of scope, that's US, and we both agree that Justice in the US is quite needing in everything that concerns <i>""""""""National Security""""""""</i>. We are speaking of Sweden and UK here.<p>Oh and... about the special relationship... sooo if this relationship is so special... and since, I pretty sure Sweden's relationship with US is not at allll that special, why the hell would he be afraid of going to Sweden to be extradicted to the US ?",1345511630

Is that a good investment? Of course. Would you want to bet a billion dollars on it? If you had $20 billion, sure -- if you had $1 billion, probably not.<p>You can easily create a real-world analogy, a dice game where you pay me $X and roll a single die. I keep your money if you roll a six, but give you five times your money back if you roll anything else. You can only play once. How much do you bet? I hope you do bet something, because it's a very favorable game to play, but I also hope that you don't sell your car, house, everything in your refrigerator, and your dog to wager everything you have.<p>The IPO price is not really relevant since he couldn't sell at that price -- he sold nearly everything at the first chance he had, which was wise of him regardless of whether Facebook's stock price goes to $0 or $500.<p>The bottom line is that this has nothing to do with Facebook and is based solely on the mathematics of random variables.",1345511513

Needless to say, all the bozos clearly went to the Management ladder, while the technical ladder kept the people with more depth in their field, the ones who actually made stuff in the first place. However, I felt that the technical ladder had flaws as well. The higher titles (principle scientist, research fellow, etc...) were simply provided based on these people's past achievements. Once you are such levels there is very little incentive to work hard to go to a higher level, and there is virtually no risk of being fired either. So, you end up with relatively senior people who reapply what worked for them instead of trying new things and pushing new technologies or new ways of doing things. And many times when I was in touch with these people in the higher technical ladder, making presentations and all, I did not find much of what they were talking about to be very impressive or innovative either.",1345510990

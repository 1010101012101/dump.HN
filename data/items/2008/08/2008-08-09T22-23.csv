I agree that non-competes are valuable to employers, because they can provide leverage for future shakedowns.<p>The question is whether non-competes are good for the worker or innovation or society in general. I think it's clear that they only hurt these things.",1218322592

272008,comment,271680,271680,0,0,mhartl,,,"Traffic jams may have complicated causes for any fixed number of cars on the road, but it's worth noting that they don't often have traffic jams in rural Kansas.  The fundamental problem of traffic is that there are too many cars on the road, and that's because road usage is priced too low.  The predictable result is queueing, i.e., traffic.  Most of the fancy investigations into the psychology of drivers, etc., are simply higher-order corrections to this basic 0th-order result.",1218322079

There aren't a lot of cases where somebody can reproduce an important new product from scratch without bringing over mountains of documentation.<p>If somebody can take the bare idea, go to a competitor,  reproduce a product, and get it out to market faster than the original company, then the previous company was probably doomed anyway. This does happen from time to time but let's face it --  this is a GOOD thing.",1218321930

271994,comment,270809,271608,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Advertisers pay for a well characterized audience (which Google infers from the search terms). Who is in the audience matters quite a bit, which is one point of attack on Google: when you only have 1% (or .01%) of their audience share starting out, you are better served if that 1% represents a significant fraction of a particular market or type of buyer instead of a representative cross section of Google's total audience. That's also a potential point of attack on eBay: you have to take a niche approach. This is often a more reliable way to gain traction than ""first/early"" or ""get big fast."" Even better if the niche is initially non-customers or customers whom existing players don't find attractive so that are less likely to mount a competitive response.",1218321022

271983,comment,271680,271784,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Right. For example, say you have a street network with a main street at capacity (IE, stabilized at crowded, but endurably so), and four outlying streets that eventually lead to the same destination, but have a less appealing route (slower, toll stops, plagued with potholes, pick one). The outlying routes may not be crowded at all, but if the main road is widened, it will probably absorb even more traffic from the outlying streets.<p>You could make this into a graph problem, if you like, or draw analogies to finding parking.",1218319779

But that&#x27;s not why they&#x27;re killing themselves. That&#x27;s just one more thing to push them over the edge. Behind it is a fundamental problem, and it&#x27;s that problem that&#x27;s making them vulnerable to something that seems trivial.<p>Please try to understand that.",1431003554

9504683,comment,9502015,9503309,0,0,rmxt,,,"Thanks for the insight. Might you be able to guess how the Bluetooth on/off/on and visible settings work for visibility for passive listening? If my phone is linked/paired with my Bluetooth headset but not visible to other devices, is it still noticeable by the passive listening devices?<p>From what I understand with WiFi and Google Location Services, if you have WiFi &quot;on but not connected&quot;, your phone is regularly sending out messages to any router that will listen saying &quot;Are you SSID x, y, z, a...etc.?&quot;  Android phones record this information, i.e., SSIDs pinged and your coarse location, and report this back to the mothership so as to improve the estimated position of all of these SSIDs/router MAC addresses. Theoretically, if I understand what you&#x27;re saying, is that there could be hardware devices that require no input from the user: the routers themselves would be noting who (i.e. which phones/MAC addresses) ping them asking for which SSIDs and record those as they progress through a space. Put enough routers in a space and you can triangulate based on RSSI....is that the basic idea?",1431003540
9504682,comment,9499457,9504272,0,0,DanBC,,,"You are framing the discussion in a certain way, and then attacking other people for things they haven&#x27;t said, and doing so aggressively and from a position of staggering ignorance. The fact you cite Laing is telling - he&#x27;s almost totally discredited now.<p>1) when you find someone who is actively planning a suicide you have a choice.  Keep them alive until they get to a professional, or treat them yourself. You wouldn&#x27;t (I assume) stick a pen through the eye of someone having a heart attack, but that&#x27;s the rough equivalent of what you&#x27;re recommending people do to suicidal people.<p>2) treatment for suicidality has two components. i) keep them alive until meds and therapy can take effect.  ii) give them meds and therapy.  Suicide <i>prevention</i> is wider.  If you&#x27;re talking about suicide prevention as a public health measure you should probably state that.  If you don&#x27;t know the words to use to specify what you&#x27;re talking about that should be a clue that perhaps you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re fucking talking about and should perhaps be a bit less arrogant.<p>3) as part of keeping someone alive until they can get help: there are things that we know mostly work, and things that we know mostly don&#x27;t work.  &quot;Low grades? That&#x27;s a bullshit reason to die! They&#x27;re not that low; you can retake them; I got worse grades and I love my awesome job so your career path could be like that!&quot; is something that we know mostly does not work.  We know because we talk to survivors of suicide.  Since there are 112 Americans per day who die by suicide we have plenty of people to talk to. If telling people their opinions was bullshit did anything to change their minds you and other people wouldn&#x27;t be having this discussion - you&#x27;d have changed their mind or they&#x27;d have changed yours.<p>4) reactive depression is still depression. It&#x27;s still an illness. The cure for reactive depression is to change the thing causing the reaction, but also provide evidence based techniques to build resiliance.<p>5) if just telling people they were wrong worked we wouldn&#x27;t have had such a high deathrate from anorexia. About 1 in 5 people with this anxiety disorder die from it (this number is going down)<p>> be an 21st century American thing, were individuals must absolutely remove any societal and personal causes for their situation. In these parts of Europe we find it OK for friends to help us see clearly what&#x27;s trivial and what&#x27;s not, and we had similar philosophies down to the time of Epicurus.<p>There are reasons for the high death rate to suicide in most (but not all!) parts of the US, and this probably is not one of them.  Decreased access to treatment; poor quality treatment; judgemental and stigmatizing views; increased use of criminal justice instead of mental health treatment; easy access to means and methods; etc etc.",1431003539

One issue of mercury poisoning is that the body has no way to get rid of it - it gets stored in the fats, IIRC. Unless you&#x27;re a mammalian mom. Then the body gets rid of mercury through your milk. Mercury is most lethal at the infant age. So in short, most dolphin mothers&#x27; firstborns die [0].<p>Anyway, perhaps the carbon fibers are actually toxic, and the only way the spiders can get rid of the material is through their silk?<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/02/11/revealing-cove-dolphins-toxic-secrets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/02/11/revealing-cove-do...</a>",1431003425

Databases, syslog-ng, elasticsearch and the systemd journal all have a defined format with plenty of tools to access the data in a more structured way (eg. treating dates as dates and matching on ranges).<p>I agree the issue at hand is not just binary vs. plain text, it&#x27;s more &quot;how much you want to structure your data&quot;.<p>The classic syslog format is very loosely defined, with every application defining its own dialect, each with its own way to separate fields and handle escaping. To fix that you could store the log data as JSON as many online services are doing. But once you have JSON, grep is no longer enough to properly handle the data even if it&#x27;s still plain text. Now that you have both a quite verbose format on disk and the need for custom tools, why not store the log as binary encoded JSON (eg. something like JSONB in PostgreSQL)? Or make it even more efficient with an format optimized for the specific usage? Add some indexes and you get more or less what databases, ElasticSearch and the journal do.<p>Also keep in mind that most of the logs right now gets rotated and compressed with gzip, I&#x27;d doubt that the above binary formats are less resilient to errors than a gzip stream.",1431003213

Which implies they are being printed in non compact form aka prettified. Thats a problem in the pure text world too. And hurts worse when it happens there. Its kind of an apples to oranges comparison.<p>Json log files should ideally print using compact form (which will never have raw newlines) so each entry only takes one line, which is then separated by a raw \n<p>If that practice is followed each line will represent the complete json object. So you can then pipe the file through jq, Perl, python etc one line at a time.<p>Printing prettified json to a log should be avoided because it then requires having to reconstitute individual events syntactically before being able to grep for an event. if pretty output is desired pipe it through a prettifier.<p>Config files are a different story, those should most definitely be pretty printed with one atom per line for nice diffability and the best read and editability json can offer.

These Z±1 neurons have pathways to various other nearby other potential Z±1 neurons; a connection lighting up between Z±1 neurons that don&#x27;t have a straightline connection over the XY map could detect different shapes. Then the Z±1 layers and their connections could be creating highway maps between both Z±2 neurons and diagonally-offset neurons that don&#x27;t &quot;fit in the grid&quot; we&#x27;re imagining here (remember, we&#x27;re in 3D and neurons don&#x27;t form a homogeneous grid, so this is all abstraction anyway).<p>These second-level connections, arguably identifying something like shapes, have connections in such a way that the next level up detects something else, etc. (insert magic we don&#x27;t understand),  until the detection results in recognizing a specific object, while the side-channel connections we haven&#x27;t mentioned yet but kept occurring at every level connect to a different side-channel ZY map for, say, the position of the object (with its own layers of processing that eventually connect to the object concept neuron so that the &quot;position&quot; is associated with the recognized object), and/or perhaps other side-channel maps or parallel XY mappings for various other things. And of course, a lot of these things connect to completely different parts that we ignore here, and a lot of the information indirectly makes its way to the conscious mind in this way; the brain doesn&#x27;t compile a complete vision report and submit it to the conscious mind in one download, it&#x27;s all using the same hardware.",1431002961

Because they can afford to, with a pipeline of thousands of qualified candidates enough of whom will be OK playing along with Google&#x27;s timeline in exchange for the significant CV boost, higher salary, prestige, experience, etc. The same applies to university applications - a lot of people will spend fortunes in time and money to try and get into Harvard, Stanford or MIT because the upside of having these schools on the CV is so high. Both prestigious jobs and universities (whether or not they should) do open doors, allow you to raise more funding and faster, to get higher positions all things being equal, to get your CV read in a pile of 200...<p>So it comes down to valuing each position&#x27;s Net Present Value (NPV) and the probability of it being a success, and deciding whether this is the most attractive use of your time and money. Let&#x27;s say AirBNB has an NPV of (an additional) $3 million over the next 10 years thanks to the network and career boost, and you have a 5% change of getting it, the value of taking the interview is still $150k. Assuming you weigh negatives 9x as high as positives (can&#x27;t remember where I read about this cognitive bias), if the interview has a total cost (including opportunity cost) of under $16k it is worth doing. Of course, at 5% chance of success per position, it&#x27;s probably worth applying to more than just AirBNB.",1431002954

From other comments you seem to have taken a fairly non-standard definition of purity and I&#x27;d encourage you to stick with the normal one as it&#x27;ll let you talk about more interesting things—see further comment on (viii).<p>I don&#x27;t think (iv) is open at all. The fact that you can encode everything as function passing is an interesting trick, but it&#x27;s merely one of several (you can, e.g., also encode everything categorically or via supercombinators and graph reduction, which turns out to be more practical for lazy languages). Function application is just one really well understood semantic foundation.<p>I find (v) far more subtle than you make it out to be. The standard static/dynamic types divide is silly because both sides are talking about different things. The static side wins completely because honestly, taken at face value, they don&#x27;t claim that much. All languages are typed, some have interesting type theories, some compilers reject programs which are syntactically OK but violate the type theory.<p>(viii) is interesting. In my mind, you&#x27;ve conflated this with what most people would call purity---however, monads are merely <i>an</i> implementation of effect typing/purity. Others exist and are experimented with. Also, composition of monads always works as desired... there&#x27;s no strange edge-case to it. It&#x27;s merely that they don&#x27;t compose like functions in a simple way. When you examine what they would entail you learn that they ought not to as well.<p>(ix) HKTs are sort of a gateway drug to type-level computation. It&#x27;s remarkable how many languages just more or less let their type-level language wither and die. I&#x27;m not claiming that HKTs are a slam dunk victory, but I would be willing to bet that the evolution of languages will lead us to (a) having them universally in the next two decades and (b) wondering why everyone was so hung up on HKTs---I mean, I suppose I can understand singletons, but HKTs?

It&#x27;s a trade-off. And it might be just an opinion, but for me it&#x27;s not a good trade-off. Learning English was a one-time endeavour for me. But binary formats and tools have to be learned separately.<p>About what you put in the log message: You can also put different fields in a line of text. Not getting the advantage or trade-off here.<p>About the internationalisations: As non-English developers we force all our systems who have logging internationalisation to English system language so we have a common ground for the messages. Understanding the English message is nearly no burden. Log Messages are Event triggers, either in code or in a developer&#x27;s/admin&#x27;s mind. If I get a log message in my native language I don&#x27;t know which event that triggers, which makes it actually harder.<p>Really. I don&#x27;t know any non-English person who considers log internationalisation a good thing. Fighting anglocentricism is a very anglocentric topic. Outside of UK/US that&#x27;s a non topic. We (non-English people) are happy that there is a language we can use to talk to each other and we don&#x27;t really care how it came to be that widely known.<p>And even if you don&#x27;t speak English, I don&#x27;t see the advantage of parsing \x03 instead of &quot;Error:.*&quot;.

Rather than grepping for what is almost always English text, one can query a language-independent set of fields, and then, if a suitable translation has been done, see the event in one&#x27;s native language.<p>When applied widely throughout a system, this leads to the internationalisation of log messages.

9504433,comment,9504204,9504381,0,0,4ad,,,"Calling C code from Go is something you do as a last resort. It breaks some desirable properties of Go programming, like fast compilation, cross compiling (at least without effort), and static binaries (without serious effort). Code called through cgo will never be idiomatic Go code, unless perhaps if hidden under an abstraction layer which takes time and effort to write and adds overhead.<p>On top of that, the cgo overhead is significant, not only in time, but in threads, so you&#x27;d want it only for big chunks of data and program accounting for it.<p>Another advantage of Go crypto is having been written in a memory safe language, and with runtime bounds checking. The assembly fast paths break some of this, but not most of it.",1431000168

Terrorists are interested in using terror to achive<p>BUT the US government ran a study in the early sixties, called the &quot;Nth Country Experiment&quot; [2], that took a few recent physics PHDs and paid them to see if they could develop a design for a nuclear weapon.

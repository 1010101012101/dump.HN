In this case, the shipped default leaned more toward convenience than security. There are tradeoffs involved.<p>GitHub provides codebase hosting to thousands of projects, some of which are private. They have a large public attack surface. And they're business which takes money. And they're probably making millions. This should imply certain things to it's management team. It's reasonable to assume they'd take security very very seriously. Perhaps not need bank-like level security, but still, pretty well up there.<p>Any Rails app developer has had the ability to unilaterally go into their own codebase and fix/close any security vulnerabilities. This same ability does not exist for users of the GitHub webapp. (Of course, we could choose not to use GitHub, but that would be good neither for GitHub or the user.)<p>That said, security is hard and getting it 100% right 100% of the time is probably impossible.

Those novice developers failed to RTFM. If you want a framework that produces secure applications for inexperienced developers who do not read the fine manual, you are setting a laudable goal for Rails, but I hardly think that Secure even for people who are 1. novices and 2. compound their ignorance by refusing to RTFM is synonymous with security problem.<p>If you open your history book to when Rails was first becoming popular, there were many people grumbling that because it was built on top of a <i>dynamic language</i> that it was vulnerable to all sorts of bugs caused by novice developers getting their types wrong. The argument at the time was that Rails provided a certain type of freedom and power at the expense of certain safeguards. The same argument was played out when people started noticing that monkey-patching run amuck caused certain problems.<p>I agree with you that this is a design choice. If you want to say that you disagree with the choice as it was originally made, I agree with that too. I wont say  that I would have made a different choice back when that feature was first baked in, I did not write the framework.

Be among the top 10 traders on a site for a few weeks and suddenly you have a reputation: you get invited to trade on more prestigious sites, join more prestigious groups and generally pal around with community elders.

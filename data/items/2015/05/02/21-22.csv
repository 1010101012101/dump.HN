In particular, with FizzBuzz there are loads of follow-up questions you can ask to find out which way the applicant thinks.  For example:<p>* Can you clean the logic flow to avoid duplicating tests?<p>* What if the tests are actually very expensive?<p>* Did they combine the mod 3 and mod 5 tests into a mod 15 test?<p>* What if that&#x27;s not possible?<p>* What happens if you unroll the loop?<p>* When might that be a reasonable thing to do?<p>Most of these are structural questions that have analogs in live code, and serve as good starting points.  They need to be adapted for the different types of work.<p>Programming exercises are well and good, but if the applicant passes the filter, and can discuss the various issues it raises, a &quot;programming exercise&quot; is really a bit marginal.  I&#x27;d rather move on to pairing with them on some real code that they&#x27;d be likely to be working on.<p>Currently there&#x27;s no service I know of that I would trust to run a coding test for me.<p>I still start with FizzBuzz (or similar).",1430603926

9478730,comment,9476650,9478274,0,0,potatoyogurt,,,"Becoming president of school clubs isn&#x27;t entitlement. What I mean is that the culture around leadership positions in high school incubates the attitudes that Michael was complaining about. Some students do legitimately learn a lot being the president of a high school club and are able to do good stuff with it. Many students, though, just run for the resume item, to help themselves rather than really to serve the organization and help it do interesting things. And because of the way our culture treats leadership, as if it were something that can exist without context, that becomes part of their identity. They&#x27;ve been the &quot;leaders&quot; of organizations all their life (which in some cases involves little more than organizing social events), they&#x27;ve gone to these fancy schools, and now, as a result, they ought to be in charge later in life, because that&#x27;s who they are and because Harvard doesn&#x27;t train followers, it trains leaders. But just because someone is the president of a social club or an a capella group in college (not to say that this is not a worthwhile thing to do), it doesn&#x27;t give them any more right or qualification to be the leader of a law firm, or an engineering firm, or an advocacy group, or a theatre troupe. Leadership isn&#x27;t a single skill or quality; it exists entirely within a context.<p>I don&#x27;t have any problem with club presidents in general. I do have a problem with some of the ideas U.S. culture (or at least middle class upward-aspiring culture) has about leadership, and I think those attitudes do lead to a destructive form of entitlement.",1430603908

Thus, when we know a face, we possess a type of knowledge that cannot be expressed as methods or rules. We can readily use this knowledge, but we cannot explain how we do it. What this means is that the only way to acquire this knowledge is by allowing it to develop in our mind; we cannot acquire it by learning some facts.

As more of our purchases are made programmatically. and as our identities, purchase patterns, credit records, even personal environmental factors can be taken into account in real-time, free market economics will force companies to adapt pricing models that can effectively exploit each customer&#x27;s individual maximum utility.<p>Sometimes the &quot;optimal&quot; economic outcome is not the moral outcome. I&#x27;m not sure I like the idea of a world where the price of a Big Mac changes as each personal steps up to the counter and their iris is scanned to determine what they can afford. I think there&#x27;s some reasonable expectation of privacy to our purchasing history which will work itself out over the next couple decade as the technology gets more advanced, sees more widespread adoption, is rallied against, and eventually regulated to some extent.<p>Part of the problem is that bad behavior is&#x27;t often punished by the market to the full extent of the damage it causes. For example, with credit cards, some cards started changing terms so that payments were applied to the lowest interest rate balance versus the highest. It&#x27;s clearly an &quot;unfair&quot; practice but because most customers of credit card companies don&#x27;t have a clue about how interest is specifically calculated, the companies that adopted the practice were rewarded with higher profit at the expense of uneducated customers. Soon it became practically necessary for all credit cards to apply payments to lowest interest rate balances first, because they couldn&#x27;t compete in the market if they didn&#x27;t. I think this is a great example where regulation can enforce good behavior aka &quot;fair dealing&quot; while ensuring there&#x27;s a level playing field so good actors aren&#x27;t at a disadvantage competing with bad actors.<p>I think so-called bad actors will take variable pricing a &quot;step too far&quot;. At some point it crosses an ethical line and becomes predatory. We haven&#x27;t exactly seen where that line is drawn, but certainly user-agent sniffing is just the beginning. The airlines can afford millions in R&D to develop the algorithms to exploit maximum utility, but who is there who can monetize the algorithms which <i>shield</i> customers against these pricing attacks? When the most popular browser is made by an advertising company whose existence depends on collecting these metrics, it does make you wonder.",1430602532

Contrary to what some might say, Japanese has all of the pronouns that are available in English (and quite a few more, because of its extensive built-in politeness system).  Where Japanese differs from English in this regard is that it allows you to drop pronouns (or rather, the sentence subject altogether) in places where English requires you to specify a subject, and it sounds stilted and unnatural in Japanese to specify a subject when it should be clear from context.  So although you can say both &quot;am I wearing the jacket?&quot; and &quot;are you wearing the jacket?&quot;, it&#x27;s much more common to hear &quot;wearing the jacket?&quot;  This can introduce ambiguity in some situations, but most of the time people understand each other perfectly well.<p>Other opportunities for ambiguity:  there is a common verb that means both &quot;to finish&quot; and &quot;to do accidentally&quot;, depending on the context, and a verb conjugation which means both &quot;to make someone do something&quot; and &quot;to let someone do something&quot;, also depending on the context.

9478613,comment,9478363,9478363,0,0,jackgavigan,,,"I was CTO of a dot-com in 2000 when the Bubble first. We had to close the company down and I ended up taking a contract setting up web servers and application servers and doing the security for online trading systems at Deutsche Bank. I discovered that investment banks are very quick to embrace new technologies that give them a competitive edge over their competitors. At the time, that included techology and software that was coming out of the Internet sector - I personally deployed Red Hat Linux, Apache/Stronghold, Netscape web server, Tomcat, Weblogic and nCipher during the 2000-&#x27;02 timeframe.<p>So, there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that a significant chunk of revenues found its way from the investment banks to companies like Red Hat and Netscape. Whether that was a &quot;make or break&quot; contribution is another question. They may have contributed to the success of a company like Red Hat but I think it would be a stretch to say that Red Hat would not have been successful without orders from the financial sector.<p>As well as financial innovation (i.e. creating CDS, CDOs, etc.), the investment banks and hedge funds also do technology innovation. They were crunching &quot;Big Data&quot; more than a decade before it became a buzzword, and using clusters and grid computing, graphics cards and FPGAs long before Bitcoin arrived on the scene. Go read <i>The Predictors</i> by Thomas A Bass, to read how a group of chaos scientists made a killing in the futures markets.<p>Some of those technologies end upo making their way into wider use but, while their contribution to the world&#x27;s tech stack is significant, I think it&#x27;s dwarfed by the new technologies that are created by non-financial-focused companies, like Apple and Tesla.<p>On the second question, I would question your assumption. One of the ways the financial system could shrink in size is through technology.<p>But, going with your assumption, my answer would be &quot;Probably.&quot;",1430601541

There have been meetings between the attorneys for both sides and the court to work out issues of case management, and rulings from the court on case management issues.<p>Oracle filed a motion asking to dismiss on two grounds: (1) if everything the plaintiff alleges is true, it does not amount to the crimes Oracle is accused of committing, and (2) the plaintiff waited too long to file, and has run into a statute of limitations problem. A ruling on this issued 2015-04-22, and is probably the most interesting development since the case was files.<p>Oracle lost on the first part of their motion. If all plaintiff allegations were proven true, they would constitute the crime plaintiff alleges, according to the court.<p>Oracle won on the second part of their motion. The alleged acts in their filing were long enough ago that the statute of limitations applies. The court gave the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to fix this. If plaintiff fails to do so, the case will be dismissed with prejudice. (Dismissal with prejudice means it ends. Dismissal without prejudice means you can try again).<p>I don&#x27;t know if this signals anything or not, but the court noted that the case management conference scheduled for the day after this ruling was to still go on. Maybe that means that the court thinks the plaintiffs have a good chance of amending the complaint to avoid the statute of limitations issue, and so expects the case will continue?<p>I&#x27;d expect the next newsworthy event to be in late May if plaintiff cannot figure out a way to amend the complaint to avoid the statute of limitations issue. If plaintiff does amend the complaint successfully, that probably won&#x27;t be newsworthy, and the case will continue. That continuation will still mostly just be motions by the parties maneuvering to try to get favorable evidence in, exclude unfavorable evidence, and get favorable interpretations of the law, and the judge&#x27;s rulings on those motions.

Which is not really that clear cut, statins have a lot of side effects that are downplayed by the sellers - and a lot less potential upside in otherwise healthy people with high cholesterol (because the fundamental cholesterol test given is flawed, the better tests are more expensive and harder to read (variables like cholesterol size and such matter a lot, but not even in the standard test))<p>So sure - get health checks done. Then be prepared to spend weeks or months double checking what your doctor is telling you, and possibly getting 2nd opinions and more tests.<p>Personal story: Head health test. High A1C. Diagnosed Diabetic, despite being a very fit triathlete who hasn&#x27;t drank soda in 6 years and eats < 20g of sugar a day. Literally had near 2 weeks of full blown panic attack. Tried to change my diet to crazy low glycemic index food and eat 8 times a day to try and get my A1C down without medicine.<p>2 weeks later got into a 2nd doctor for another opinion. Turned out my test was just bunk. A1C is fantastic. Apparently it happens all the time (a bad test). My first doctor did not tell me this at ALL.. just told me I was a diabetic and to stop drinking so much Soda.<p>My takeaway?  If not showing signs, don&#x27;t bother with routine tests. Too many medical quacks.",1430600689

Don&#x27;t make up a question because you think it&#x27;s the same thing as your actual question. Otherwise you&#x27;ll waste people&#x27;s time because they are answering the question you asked - regarding a single line - rather than the question you mean - several files of GPL code.<p>I gave three answers. The BSD one was the second.<p>My third answer, regarding &quot;mere aggregation&quot; should suffice. The GPL says:<p>> A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#x27;s users beyond what the individual works permit.<p>In a court of law, should this be taken to trial, can you demonstrate that the historical code is not combined with other code to form software which is not compatible with the GPL? If so, you&#x27;re free and clear.<p>You elsewhere asked:<p>> So, if I distribute GPL code in a project&#x27;s history as documentation, but not in the final version, am I required to license my life&#x27;s work as GPL, and not BSD?<p>NO! NO!, and NO! As alain94040 wrote, &quot;The GPL is not <i>that</i> contagious&quot;. The resulting program produced must be redistributable under the GPL.<p>You control the copyright to your code. You can have it be whatever you want. The GPL is only enforced upon the production of a program, and only because the GPL component is part of the result. So long as the resulting program can be redistributed by downstream users under the GPL, there&#x27;s no problem. You can put the code in the public domain, or the MIT license, or the Apache license, or anything else which is compatible with the GPL. It&#x27;s your code and your copyright.",1430600627

I could have been a lot worse off had I continued to pursue treatment.<p>That said, in a state where anxiety is controlled and my health is now stable, it&#x27;s still important to be aware of changes and new symptoms, and to have an annual standard physical with a doctor you trust and stick with consistently so they know you and your body over time.

I identify at least two groups of people -- &quot;users&quot; and &quot;crackers&quot; -- with different goals and interests. By their own admission, the &quot;crackers&quot; (i.e. &quot;people who remove the copy protection&quot;) actually get a kick out of these protections schemes; the harder they are to crack, the more enjoyment they get out of it. They even state crackers seldom play the games they crack, and that most of their enjoyment comes from the actual process of finding and bypassing the DRM. You could say that for them, the &quot;game&quot; is actually the cracking.<p>In the end they state the effort was worthwhile, but I&#x27;m not so convinced. True, they claim the majority of a game&#x27;s earnings happen in the first few weeks of a game&#x27;s release, and if they can stop the crackers for that long, it&#x27;s a win. But it also took them almost a month of programmer&#x27;s time to stop a crack that appeared a few months after release. Also, the DRM itself made debugging and testing the game very hard, particularly because the effects of the DRM were designed to look like bugs! So at least for the players and legit users of the game, the DRM is a clear lose: a convoluted protection scheme that made the game harder to test and therefore made bugs/design errors more likely.",1430600432
9478548,comment,9478355,9478355,0,0,ColinWright,,,"A question for the author.<p>In my personal experience, a significant proportion of the people applying for programming positions have been unable to write programs.  And as the original articles about FizzBuzz say, not just unable to write big programs, but unable to write even small programs.<p>I want to make sure I don&#x27;t waste my time or theirs, so I need a quick, effective filter to allow me to terminate an interview early, assuming they&#x27;ve got that far.<p>Currently I sit them at a laptop, or allow them to bring their own, and ask them to write a program in the language of their choice to perform a simple task, similar to FizzBuzz.  Depending on the position they&#x27;re applying for I will sometimes be a little more specific about the language, but usually I&#x27;m pretty relaxed.  If someone can program in any language then they&#x27;ve passed this filter and we can get down to bigger issues such as system design, decoupling, testing, logging, debugging, inter-process communications, security, and more.<p>I need something that is so simple that it won&#x27;t faze a nervous, inexperienced applicant.<p>For information, we&#x27;ve asked some applicants to submit as part of their application a program in Python that will, given a parameter of length <i>n,</i> print all the strings obtained by deleting a single character.  Thus their program should print <i>n</i> strings, each of length <i>n-1.</i>  One applicant did so, and then when asked in interview about his program he couldn&#x27;t identify the place the argument was first used.  It turned out he&#x27;d had someone else write the code for him.<p>I&#x27;ve also had an applicant refuse to do it, claiming to be too senior to be bothered with such trivialities.  He said he was an analyst and system architect/designer, since that&#x27;s what we were asking for.  So I invited him to perform a cost/benefit analysis of a trivial test to decide whether a reported bug actually existed, and he ended up arguing that a test such as FizzBuzz is the right thing to be doing.  He then did it.  And we hired him.<p>The FizzBuzz test is not intended to discover if the applicant can program.  It&#x27;s intended purely to identify those who genuinely cannot program.  At all.  And it&#x27;s amazingly effective.<p>What would you suggest?",1430600411

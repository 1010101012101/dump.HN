7128217,comment,7125546,7125546,1,0,hangonhn,,,"I wonder how they&#x27;re going to navigate that since companies in China must be 51% Chinese owned.  This is why Chinese cars are often joint ventures between foreign and domestic car companies.  Chinese car companies would love nothing more than to acquire advanced electric car technology because they&#x27;re so disruptive.  They can in a flash disrupt all the technological advantages foreign car companies have in their technical know-how around gasoline and diesel engines.<p>If Tesla&#x27;s IPs and manufacturing capabilities end up in Chinese hands, all foreign car companies would be so screwed in China and possibility else where.  The Chinese have shown a lot of boldness in their infrastructure projects.  I can imagine them building charging stations throughout the country in just a few years.  Once that happens, all gasoline cars would be at such a disadvantage.  The relative efficiency of electricity generated from power plants vs. gasoline cars could have a significant effect on China&#x27;s oil import (their major Achilles Heel) and pollution.  China has no qualms about nuclear power.  BTW, China also has the world&#x27;s biggest automobile market.<p>The Chinese would love to have a Chinese Tesla.

Immoral design, which is also bad design, is the opposite. It takes life by stealing time; it impoverishes by pretending to be more than it is; it does not last; it deceives, harms, enrages and degrades. The difference between the two lies at the origin of the work, when the designer first establishes their true goals and decides whether it is to satisfy their destructively selfish aims, or it is to be something higher, something that respects and elevates people’s lives, something that they are not ashamed to put out into this world because they know that their heart lies in the right place; and if they fail to achieve what they set out to do, it will be but an error of affection, not ill work laden with guilt.",1390787691

7128163,comment,7124139,7127215,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"No not at all. IMO that has nothing to do with intelligence/education. The issue is twofold. First, most voters in Ukraine have known the USSR and it does skew their views. The &quot;good old times&quot; seem too good to let go. The propaganda machine was strong back then and the idea that Russia could lead the entire region into its former glory does have some appeal.<p>Second, the people with ties to both Russia and Ukraine might actually believe that Ukraine is just a part of Russia and that its independence is a temporary thing. The two countries have a very long history that is full of intertwined interests, population mixing, etc. Remember that Kiev was a prospering city from where the ruling class moved to a tiny fortress up north called Moscow.<p>I do not buy &quot;Ukraine is a Russian territory&quot; mostly based on the treatment that the Ukrainian nationals in the USSR received: artificial feminine, oppression, active suppression of Ukrainian culture and language, etc. The biggest hurdle here IMO is that Ukraine has not been independent for very much of its existence and has only known democracy in the last 23 years. The people have no sense of how a democracy is supposed to look, feel, and work. I think that once people who lived in the USSR are replaced with the generations to follow things might improve slightly. For now this is all really a struggle to find the Ukrainian identity. To put this into perspective think of the US in 1800. Not exactly a stable or peaceful time, is it?",1390786765

For example, to a working water supply and sewage system, to the banking system, to telephones, to health care, to parental leave, to the judicial system, to weather reports, and so on.<p>Some of that can be worked around, like by going off the grid, but not all.

If you don&#x27;t have access to the court system, then what do you do when your neighbor decides to move the fence 3 meters closer to your house?<p>Indeed, I can easily consider a government based completely on the threat of the withdrawal of services rather than force. Some very rich people, and certain groups like the Amish, may be able to go it alone. Otherwise, the switching cost of leaving government services will be too high.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s reasonable to think of government as synonymous, even poetically speaking, with coercion by force.

As a friend of mine always likes to say, trade is like technology: you can think of other countries like a machine where you put in one kind of good (exports) and get back another (imports).  So why would you want to impose a special tax on this machine?  Economic theory suggests that to do so would be inefficient.<p>The only valid reason for protectionism is strategic: e.g. having the ability to make things for yourself in case other countries cut off supply.  The US is by far the world leader in military technology so I don&#x27;t think this is an issue.",1390785565

I can only think of a couple of singles but they were very catchy (Last Friday Night and California Girls).<p>I tend to view rock and pop and most other mainstream genres as simply one super-genre: modern song. It amuses me slightly when rock fans look down on pop music when really the difference is very small.",1390784576

The broad parameters are &quot;something to do with Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)&quot;, which is a field that tries to straddle the fine line between contemporary AI and sci-fi AI, without erring too far in the direction of either too incrementalist to too pie-in-the-sky. More specifically on the &quot;methods&quot; side, they have people who are known in both statistical ML, and in the recent resurgence of neural-networks known as &quot;deep learning&quot;.<p>You can discern some more about their general direction by looking at courses they&#x27;ve been involved with, talks they&#x27;ve given or sponsored, etc., but as far as I know (and I tried to probe a few months ago through a friend who knew someone there) their actual product / business / etc. hasn&#x27;t really been leaked, or at least not leaked widely enough that I could find out about it.",1390784550

I&#x27;ve personally been thinking about forking the pre-AGPL version, or just writing my own.  I&#x27;ll probably just write my own.<p>(I&#x27;m looking to extract audio clips from video files by using the subtitles and timing information, to create listening flashcards.  Since Anki doesn&#x27;t really do this, not reusing their code isn&#x27;t really a big deal.)",1390784450

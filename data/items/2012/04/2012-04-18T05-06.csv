If the intent is really to treat everything as donations then every tier should include ""acknowledgment as a backer"". As it stands today it's only stated for $1000+ level and that's not really acceptable if you consider everything a form of donation. I saw very little in the description or ""rewards"" that really treated backers as genuine donations rather than just simple pre-orders (that includes access to betas and/or user testing). It was rather confusing compared to nearly every other project I've contributed to on Kickstarter.<p>You're right that the tiers can't change much now, but the way it was structured and worded is indeed discouraging. I know I was certainly discouraged as a result, and I'm currently on the fence as to whether to contribute now or wait and see how it turns out. If this project doesn't succeed in making it's goal I would really recommend looking at the more successful software projects in detail and notice how they go out of their way to message and recognize backers in a way that makes them feel like their genuinely contributing, even if only in spirit, and orient their rewards accordingly. Adding buttons, logo stickers, t-shirts, posters, etc. are the kind of things that a community of supporters will desire and from what I've seen so far, go a long way in encouraging larger donations.<p>edit: removing suggestion to rollup rewards due to their potential for complicating things.",1334728572

3856679,comment,3854715,3855342,2,0,Lazare,,,"Increased the value by $X?  Oh heavens no, that's far too optimistic.<p>You see, one of the joys of being a homeowner is that you have the option of improving your house so it's better to live in...for you.  That might mean granite countertops, or that shade of fuchsia you LOVE on the bathroom walls, or a hot and cold running Pepsi, or a built in movie theatre, or a library, or...well, whatever it is you, personally, like.<p>We can assume that - unless you screwed up or got ripped off - that you personally value whatever improvements you make at more than their cost.  ""Wow, the main hallway is a halfpipe so I can practice my skate moves!  I'd have paid $50k for that, but it only cost me $30k to have it built!  SCORE!""<p>But, human taste being what it is, the next guy probably doesn't value whatever you built as highly as you do.  Pretty much everyone likes stuff like having a closet in every bedroom; that's why houses tend to have them.  But not everyone really cares about having a mirrored ceiling in the kitchen (perfect for cake decoration!).  The fact that every house doesn't have them is a good sign that most people value this ""wonderful"" feature as being less valuable than the cost to install it.<p>Which is why, as a general rule, and with a few very specific exceptions, any improvement you make will always add less than $X to the market value.  There's a few areas where you <i>might</i> be able to break even or even gain on the deal.  If there's a gaping hole in the lounge, fixing that is probably worth it.  Sure the next owner could fix it too, but you're going to have a hard time selling it like that.  If you have vintage 1970s shag carpets and avacado wallapper, this might also be a good candidate.  (Although you might luck into finding a buyer who'll pay <i>more</i> for the nostalgia value, I guess...)<p>But everything else (and especially any remodelling of an otherwise perfectly functional kitchen or bathroom just to add nicer fittings, which is stupidly common mistake) is almost certainly going to lose you money if you're just looking to sell the house.  If it costs $X, it will (almost) always add much less than $X to the market value.",1334727838

3856632,comment,3854441,3854441,1,0,CLORO,,,"While I concur that objectivity is important, I would not completely discredit that there are severe economic concerns with cyber crime. I've seen first hand vast amounts of intellectual property being obtained illegally through coercion and manipulation of private and federal systems. Working in a position to detect and prevent you'll find often that the victims are not aware of their losses nor the secondary conditionals that drive associated costs. Most cyber crime in't as clearly defined as say a list of credit cards stolen from a services provider. These are the models you can somewhat quantify a worse case estimate for. All that's required is that you tally up the limits on all the cards and say the potential was for x amount of monetary loss. Is the number a realistic answer or projection? Not really, often it's way out of touch with reality, the question then becomes how do you define realistic loses?<p>It's true that there aren't models that can clearly and appropriately estimate losses for an entity. This is due in part to the large costs that aren't a known in that exposure of credit card numbers. Addressable's such as client confidence, the manpower and time to disseminate information to the victims, the time spent eradicating all flaws being levied by the actors which alone are not inclusive of your overall downtime and even public shame, all items hard to quantify a numerical value for. We can argue about models, but the truth is there is never a model for every scenario. You can only go by speculation and assumption. So it's with that understanding that I somewhat allow an inflated estimate of real damage. If at the end of the day, the horror stories read online push users and admins to educate themselves, even if out of fear of overly estimated loses, I see no harm.<p>Personally, I fell the more appropriate response is to give clear guidance as to how these incidents were born. It's only through proper education of users and admins alike, that we'll be able to stymy those attempting harm.<p>In concurrence with your comment, there is no doubt that there is sensationalization on the part of everyone at play. Antivirus and malware removal manufacturers want to project an image of fear. It's this sense of fear that drives their market. However inappropriate it may be, it at least drives discussion. It's only with proper education that users see the difference between realistic threats and the hollywood movie projections.",1334726431

There's nothing unconscionable about conditioning a sale on ""don't share this with the world for free"" terms.<p>* Piracy has had a massive disruptive effect on the music industry. It isn't that technology simply devalued the professional skills of musicians (it did that, too). Much of what's happened to music with technology <i>wasn't planned by the industry</i>, but rather abetted by it once it started happening. That's why we have one dominant iTunes Music Store; they got to be the first mover on ""downloading music not for free"" when the whole industry was getting shellacked by pirates.<p>* The tech industry is fundamentally more heartless and efficient than the music industry was. Lowery thinks musicians had a better deal under the labels than the tech giants ""by accident"". It's not an accident: tech companies are much better at extracting surplus value than most industries, and they're merciless about it. And I think for the most part (with the possible exception of Apple) he's right: the tech industry could give a flying fuck about the economics of professional musicianship. The musicians could all go broke tomorrow; they'd get their pageviews somewhere else.<p>Ultimately, and this is pretty navel-gazey and arrogant so I apologize in advance, I have a diagnosis. At least with regards to the geek mindset. We're bullies. It's ironic, since so many of us got picked on in school, but the prevailing attitude among technologists is ""if you can do it with a computer, it's pointless to reason about whether you should do it"". Maybe it's because my particular field spends so much time discovering things people <i>really shouldn't be doing with computers</i>, but this is an especially aggravating and hollow attitude to me. It's bullying when you break contracts, promises, and the law just to get convenient access to a piece of music by a guy who's making less than a McDonalds manager; it's especially bullying when you tell him he should get a better business model. ""Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself!""<p>Man, what I wouldn't give to hear Steve Albini's response to Lowery's rant. They had to have met; Andy Mason worked at Electrical Audio before he started ThePoint.com, where Lowery worked. It blows my mind that the lead singer from Camper Van Beethoven worked for Andy Mason in Chicago at ThePoint.com.",1334725381

When Zuckerberg was forced to make an IPO, he did everything in his power to minimize outside control. I also believe(not sure about this), that Zuckerberg still retains majority control of the company.",1334725338

I think their primary concern must be to release a basic thing out first and then iterate over it. This way they will get both contributions and the product going.<p>Decide what your design goals are, define what code and quality goes in and out of your repo. Build something basic, release it and then iterate. Contributions and donations will follow. But if you are expecting mass adoption for a tool designed primarily for Clojure then, Clojure itself is in low adoption stage now. On top of that people who use clojure wanting to use will be fewer(Emacs + Slime really works well). So the initial payment model with only Clojure support may not bring them much money. This definitely has to be a platform like Emacs. And then the money can come from upgrades, major revisions.<p>Also it would have been nice if language used to extend this was Clojure itself.<p>We desperately need some modern GUI candy on an Emacs like editor which can be extensible by Lisp.",1334725255

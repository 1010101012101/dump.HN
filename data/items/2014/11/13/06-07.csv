Yet this very seamlessness, which had rendered physical mail an expensive novelty, might as easily be viewed as porosity, and as such created the need for the service the girl provided. Physically transporting bits of information about a grid that consisted of little else, she provided a degree of absolute security in the fluid universe of data.

The scope of transactions supported by a system is a different set of considerations from the level of consistency it provides. Bigtable is consistent but only allows for transactionality at the row level.<p>Optimistic concurrency control is nothing new and Percolator layered transactions on top of Bigtable years back. Furthermore, TrueTime -- allowing for comparatively low-latency update across a globally distributed set of DCs -- is the real innovation in Spanner, not the use of optimistic concurrency control.<p>Honestly, I am not sure what this article is trying to claim, except perhaps that per-node performance has been improved.

Although significant heterogeneity in some of the main effects&#x27; analyses limited ability to pool effect sizes across some studies, a number of pooled effect sizes were calculated. When compared with no treatment, exercise resulted in small weight losses across studies. Exercise combined with diet resulted in a greater weight reduction than diet alone (WMD - 1.0 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.3 to -0.7). Increasing exercise intensity increased the magnitude of weight loss (WMD - 1.5 kg; 95% CI -2.3 to -0.7). There were significant differences in other outcome measures such as serum lipids, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose. Exercise as a sole weight loss intervention resulted in significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure (WMD - 2 mmHg; 95% CI -4 to -1), triglycerides (WMD - 0.2 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1) and fasting glucose (WMD - 0.2 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1). Higher intensity exercise resulted in greater reduction in fasting serum glucose than lower intensity exercise (WMD - 0.3 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.5 to -0.2). No data were identified on adverse events, quality of life, morbidity, costs or on mortality.<p>> The results of this review support the use of exercise as a weight loss intervention, particularly when combined with dietary change. Exercise is associated with improved cardiovascular disease risk factors even if no weight is lost.",1415861230

It&#x27;s like a perfect storm of terrible voter turnout, but not by chance, since people who have lived in the same place for 20 years and are old enough to easily take a day off are most likely republican.<p>Maybe voting shouldn&#x27;t be a one day affair.

The vast majority of violent crime is committed by people who do not have a mental illness.<p>Your comment is stigmatizing and ignorant.  OP is male.  You do not seem to be askin about the risk of violence because of his maleness even though most violent crime is commited by men.<p>About one in six people over 16 have a significant mental health problem.  The US has a population of hundreds of million people over sixteen - let&#x27;s say 250million.  That gives about 41 million people with a significant mental illness.  Each year about 16,000 people are murdered in US, so even if every single murder was committed by someone with a mental illness you still have 41million (minus 16,000) safe people who have a mental health problem. But research suggests that only about 10% of mirder is committed by someone with a mental illness.<p>[1] using current UK terminology",1415858603

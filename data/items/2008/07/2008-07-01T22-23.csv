233629,comment,233172,233538,0,0,PieSquared,,,"I was the one asking the parent question (something about a comparison between Vim and Emacs). I have, since then, spent at least 20 or so hours struggling with Emacs...<p>And although I wasn't sure at first, I'm pretty sure it's worth it. Though many of the things in Emacs are nowhere near perfect (like the in-buffer terminal, blech!), it feels like something that can go much farther than Vim in terms of I'm-going-to-turn-my-text-editor-into-a-full-fledged-IDE type stuff. I still don't know if I'm going to stay with it, but I've promised to myself that I'll use nothing else to edit text for a month. When that's done, I'll decide, though I suspect by then I won't want to switch.",1214952973

233617,comment,232890,232890,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Exceptions suck, but I really think this is going the wrong way.<p>Exceptions usually suck because people are trying to graft some kind of complicated event handling system on it, to which it's not suited. Frankly, this sort of thing is better handled by co-routines. Exceptions suck because they're the often the only way to do something without more explicit control flow.<p>On top of this, we're supposed to be able to check everything and write error checked code, but suppressing errors can be surprisingly beneficial: observe, say, DRYing out deep checks <a href=""http://code.causes.com/blog/drying-out-deep-checks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.causes.com/blog/drying-out-deep-checks</a>.<p>One of the reasons GOTO sucked so much was because at the time it was all we had. Now it isn't. Explicit control flow is useful and important for certain tasks (like network programming).",1214951386

233606,comment,233172,233557,0,0,ajross,,,"But that's the wrong dichotomy.  The problem is you're stuck in a particular mode of ""usability"" analysis.  Basically, if you're the kind of person for whom TextMate (or whatever -- any GUI editor ir IDE fits the same model) is good enough, and you don't know why you would want to try emacs, you are <i>not</i> going to like emacs.<p>The point is you have to ""get"" it.  There's a point of epiphany after you've been using it for a while where you realize that you're not just changing your tool, you're changing the way you work and think about problems.  This is the moment where ""usability"" suddenly acquires an entirely new definition for you, and you're hooked.<p>But you need to junk TextMate first.  You can't just try emacs, you have to live it, at least for a while.   How's that for a zen answer? :)",1214950725

233598,comment,233103,233457,0,0,bhb,,,"Exactly. I'd still love to see real study on whether unit testing is worth it (which our survey doesn't even begin to address, since it's very hard to measure). I think some good studies on that would be invaluable, but it's nearly impossible to control for all the variables, so I'm not holding my breath.<p>Failing that, most of the ""evidence"" one way or the other is based on asking people who test or don't test - and probably most testers would say that testing is great while non-testers would say testing wouldn't catch the kinds of bugs that matter. On the flip side, you have some testers saying it's not valuable (because their test quality is bad) and some non-testers saying they are sure tests would help, but only because they imagine tests to be a silver bullet.<p>In any case, our survey was just supposed to get a rough feel for how many people were doing testing (and what tools they used). What surprised me most was that even small teams (1 and 2 people) often had a test suite. This flew in the face of the anecdotal evidence we had previously gotten from other startups (almost none of ones we have talked to use tests).",1214950276

233591,comment,233166,233569,0,0,scumola,,,"Yea, we only submitted our site to one VC group so-far, and the competition was fierce (380 submissions and only 10 were chosen for funding).  I've never dealt with Investors of any kind before, so it's kind of a new game to me.  I'm comfortable with a keyboard and a compiler, not so much with business people and I suck at golf.  :)<p>It's interesting that even this article on YC has inspired people to submit their own personal Flash websites, so we'll crawl them and index them, so there's <i>some</i> interest.  How much interest is still yet to be seen.  We're not into the 10k uniques or anywhere close to it, so that's a catch-22.<p>I'm intimidated by Google and Yahoo going into this market full-steam and us being the only bug to squash.  They might not even care about us and just roll over the top of us, but I think - at least listening to what others have suggested is that the key is to out-innovate Google and Yahoo and just do a better job.  Ask.com has <i>great</i> search results, but hardly anyone even knows that they exist.  Personally, I think that google likes that their search results are lame - they sell more ad clicks that way.  Google's search results are just 'good enough' to keep people from abandoning their site and going somewhere else.  Also all of the other web-apps give customers a warm-fuzzy about using a Google service.  I know that we have all of that to compete with, but I'm still optimistic.  :)",1214949679

74965,comment,74700,74864,0,0,vegashacker,,,"The thing is, when I'm doing anything but programming (web surfing, watching a DVD, playing music, etc.) I want the smooth, easy-to-use, pleasant-looking experience that I get on a Mac.  I periodically try Unix window managers to see how they're doing, but they honestly always seem pretty clunky to me.<p>But let's say for a minute that I did go the Unix window manager route.  What would you recommend if I wanted to have one ""mode"" where basically everything is stripped away (no menu bar, no windows, nothing -- just a shell), and another  mode which was your standard GUI?  It would have to be fast to switch between the two.",1193895959
74964,comment,74941,74941,0,0,ajkates,,,"From what you describe, it looks like there may be room for a competitor.  Before putting in the time though, do some research (if you haven't already).  Can it really be that profitable?  What percentage of the market do you plan to capture?<p>I'm often wary of startups that differentiate themselves on a cost basis when the cost is minimal ($3 in this case).  Even if the margins are substantial, the difference between $3 to get things done right, and any other lower price offered by a competitor, just may be an insignificant point of differentiation.

74961,comment,74900,74922,0,0,ajkates,,,"Yes, I suppose it is a bit bitter.  And certainly, some people find value and fun in applications; I only argue that those people are primarily high-schoolers.  In my humble opinion, alienating the loyal and valuable users, and catering to the younger users, is just asking for disaster (and perhaps a mass-exodus in due time).",1193895362

Don't go overboard on the social networking bit though.  Just take some off-the-shelf forum software and add the ability to have your competition history appear in your profile and to search for other users by competition.",1193895320

Steve Ballmer's competitive advantage is not technical; it is the flipping great wodge of cash that he possesses. He wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't use it. Microsoft's leader, like a lion, is amoral: if he can get away with something that benefits him, he will do it, in fact, he <i>must</i> do it.",1193895022

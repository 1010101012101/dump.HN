It may be that the job involves no overtime per se, but I still never liked getting the impression, early in a job interview, that the person was already looking for opportunities to take time off.

1100081,comment,1099722,1099922,0,0,briansmith,,,"Symbian isn't open sourcing any of those things either, AFAICT. Symbian will still have many closed source components similar to Android. Symbian also has components that are not open source, but whose Android equivalents are--e.g. its fonts and the font rendering code. In fact, the Symbian fonts have a very restrictive license--no redistribution allowed, usage for R&D purposes only.<p>Further, during the open-sourcing process, Symbian created new (""open source special"") implementations of some components; that is, the open-source implementations of some components are not the same as the implementations that real devices have been using. It will be a long time, if ever, before these open-source versions catch up to the production-quality versions.<p>The Android license (BSD) is a lot easier/safer to comply with than Symbian's license (EPL). And, if you actually want to read the source code, Android's code is a lot easier to jump into than Symbian's is. (I'm not saying Android's code is better or that Symbian's code is bad; I'm just saying that there are many layers of indirection and unusual, Symbian-specific idioms in Symbian's code that makes it difficult to read.)<p>Anyway, I don't understand why Symbian is so eager to start the ""who's more open source"" debate. On many points, Android clearly wins on open-sourciness. I'm sure Symbian wins on other open-sourciness points. Open-sourcing was a smart thing for Symbian to do, whether Android exists or not, and I think Symbian should emphasize the positive aspects of this change.<p>That said, it would be very cool if somebody created a table that detailed which parts of Android and Symbian are open source, component-by-component, side-by-side.",1265269871

But I think one lesson learned from Tipjoy is that merchant acquisition is the hard part about making a payments system. Increasing conversion rates is nice, lower overhead from micropayments is nice, but does is drive higher revenue? You have to prove that (or something else, like great customer service) to sell to merchants.<p>I also think this focus on pay later doesn't necessarily work for those new to the system (i.e. everyone that matters) who could still be apprehensive and hesitant to commit to a transaction.<p>The use of reputation isn't new. Spare Change had a system of reputation for those who reversed transactions. They let merchants block those with low reputations. A fun anecdote is that they needed to make a reverse-reverse transaction for those that wanted the reputation back.<p>But let me bring it back to merchant acquisition.

I can pretty confidently expect to figure out what they mean in any case I need to.<p>And yeah, the language has arguably become less Pythonic as it caters to more expert programmers at the expense of less expert ones.  From the beginning, there have been people who claimed that primitive, clear, inelegant code is worse than elegant, concise code that depends on extra language features.  Usually that claim has been rejected, but as sometimes happens in politics, the people who care enough to influence the process are not always the people for whom the process is supposed to work.  I see decorators as something of a Trojan horse through which Python became more of a language for me (a software developer who copes with, and sometimes even likes, C++) and less of a language for my customers (scientists and engineers).  Which is tragic because there are plenty of languages for software developers and not enough languages for people who just need something stupidly simple yet powerful enough for all practical purposes.<p>Still, despite the erosion of its simplicity, Python stands out for its philosophy of simplicity and its adherence to it.

Code as data is such a powerful idea,  it is independent of the underlying paradigm of the language, you can have an algol with lisp syntax and it would be lisp, you can have smalltalk with lisp syntax and it would be lisp. Code is data is the only lisp feature you can't take away from lisp, because if you add it to your language, you don't have a new language, you have a new lisp.<p>Thats why lispers are smug sometimes, they know that their language will change dramatically in the future to adapt to the new environment, its the source of lisps immortality, it is destined to be reinvented.",1265266950

Though it uses normal JavaScript objects for the stack frames (modulo some __proto__ hackery to serve as the static link), so I'm curious how well V8 can optimize that.",1265266925

In the second year, purchases fall, and in the third year there are none at all. If the second-hand market could be eliminated, books would last longer than 3 years and could be cheaper. There is a way: to produce electronic books [e-books] and kill them after a year.</i><p>That answer bothers me, a lot.

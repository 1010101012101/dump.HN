I'd love to hear any feedback from you all.  Regardless of political views, this is a historic event and I don't want to live through it thinking only what the media tells me about it.

Examples like yours are used, I've noticed, a great deal in the history lessons of James Burke (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_%28science_historian%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_%28science_historia...</a>).  He regularly describes what someone did, using an uncommonly-known name.  Then uses the name everyone knows as a fun little reveal at the end of section.<p>Why not totally off-topic... Well, he also seems to use it so that he can focus on the person's actions in the descriptive context of the person's time/inventions which he has been using up to that point.  See, if he brought in the well-known name early, then he well effectively be changing the subject from what he was talking about to what people know about the famous person.  And that harms his attempt to show a new angle on the well-known person.  This is Somewhat similar to a pseudonym allowing an position/argument to float free from the particular individual stating it, and thus be judged on its own merits.",1319122756

We've seen time and again that the RIAA and the MPAA actually do appear to be hell-bent on fucking consumers over with their lawsuits and while I dislike calling anything evil, the actions of law firms and content companies come close enough to make me uneasy.<p>As an example of a hole, none of your post addresses the point made in the article that it is often impossible to get the culturally-relevant thing that you want legally, whereas it is easy to get it illegally. Take the example of ""Lost"" that was given.<p>It is credible to make the claim that Lost was a piece of culture that was unique to the time that it was shown; it was a topic of everyday conversation and its cultural significance has diminished over time. What made Lost valuable and interesting was being a part of the community that watched Lost, in a sense. With the internet, one can reasonably claim that the community was global. If you are relegated to watching Lost several months after it has been seen (and discussed) elsewhere, the value of watching Lost is considerably lower. The artistic merit of the show was the tension of the story arc, I think, and the opportunity to discuss it with friends, colleagues and strangers.<p>When the blogger tried to follow the legal method of watching Lost, the behaviour of the content distributor ruined it completely. They delayed the showing so that he missed the global hype and destroyed the program by means of an advert for it <i>in the middle of the program itself!</i>. This is so ridiculous that it is almost kafka-esque. Had the blogger obtained the program illegally, its value to him would have been much higher <i>regardless of his financial outlay</i>.<p>The point of the original blog is not just that piracy is cheaper, more convenient and typically of low consequence. The point is that piracy allows you to participate in global culture events and results in a much better quality product.<p>You cannot equate this to stealing gasoline at all, I'm afraid. The loss of any resources as a consequence of piracy is debatable, which it is not in the case of a physical good. More importantly, gasoline is a commodity; stealing it does not improve the product. Whilst piracy results in a better-quality, more timely product, it will remain popular. The reason the legal services offered by iTunes and Netflix are so popular is nothing to do with their pricing models and everything to do with the quality of the product, i.e. the size of their libraries and that the media within the libraries are of sufficiently high quality.<p>Your last paragraph as a call-to-action is somewhat misplaced. There have been startups in this space that have been killed by the behaviours of the content companies themselves. Whilst others do appear to be succeeding (not just content distributors but content <i>creators</i>, which is fantastic), that takes a lot of time and is not something for which we can out the cultural participation of tens of millions of people on hold.",1319121723

I didn't share the music, I didn't burn the music to disks. I just acquired it to listen at home. The reason was I simply didn't have the money to buy every album of every artist I liked. Instead I downloaded the music and paid to see them live.<p>This really all changed with Spotify. A flat monthly fee to listen to as much music as I want. This was all I wanted all along. I don't care for owning music. Now I buy the albums of a handful of artists for my iPod. Then use Spotify around the house. This is the music industry adapting to the needs of the listener. Its good stuff.<p>With movies. I love the cinema and watch most movies there. I hate the cost of dvd's. If I buy a DVD I watch it maybe once a year... if that. I will watch the extra's once. The cost of a new DVD is like 12, BluRay is higher... I just don't see the value in it. There is rental but again, its bad value. It costs like 4 for one night. Often the disk doesn't include the special features. The ad's at the start of the disk cannot be skipped.. It requires a lot of planning to ensure your night is actually free to watch the film.<p>If I was in the states I would get NetFlix but where I am there still isn't much alternative to downloading a film for the single viewing or waiting 6 months till it eventually comes into the sale.<p>My main gripe is with TV shows. I enjoy US TV shows. I don't want the worlds most expensive TV package to catch them all scattered across ten's of channels. Even if I had all the channels. Watching it week by week with ad's. Boring. Even when the US season end's. The DVD or paid download version doesn't come out in my country for 6-12 months later because local TV is still waiting to show it...<p>This model to me seems broken. It is too slow and separate's fans of the show from the show itself. I download most shows I watch. I then buy the boxed set when it comes out here so I can get the extra's and support the show.<p>In my opinion piracy in terms of downloading for individual consumption is - in many cases - understandable.

I say that because I had to research whether I could use a long value as both a reference count when a struct was in use, and a free list pointer when a struct was not in use.  I didn't want to declare the field as a clunky union, but as simply ""long"".<p>I researched the issue in the C Language Reference Manual, document 007-0701-150, available on the web as a PDF.  Here are my notes:<p>""In the value structure, the reference count N is a long int, which guarantees\nthat it can also be used as a pointer to link unused values on the free list,\nwithout my having to use a cumbersome union type.<p>The standard says:<p><pre><code>  long ints are large enough to hold pointers in -n32 and -o32 mode.  Both are\n  32 bits wide.\n\n  long ints are large enough to hold pointers in -64 mode.  Both are 64 bits\n  wide.\n</code></pre>\n(C Language Reference Manual, document 007-0701-150, Appendix A, Section F.3.7\n""Arrays and Pointers"")<p>Assuming there are no other modes, I conclude that long ints are large enough\nto hold pointers, period.<p>As further evidence, the section titled ""Integer and Floating Point Types"" has\na table of Storage Class Sizes which lists the size in bits for the various\ntypes in all three modes -o32, -n32, and -64.

You seem to be of the opinion that supporting the least-evil companies will slowly shift the standard MO in the market towards less evil activities, but there's two problems: (1) This hasn't actually helped unseat the incumbent corporations, and (2) there's nobody who is sufficiently not-evil to the point where they are worth supporting.<p>This isn't a consumer-and-business problem. This is not something that can be fixed by improving consumer awareness. The problem isn't that consumers aren't making smart choices, the problem is that this market exists at all. Copyright was never meant to be abused this way, and our continued compliance towards the market and the corporations participating in it are not helping.<p>I'd like to make an analogy. Consider the bottled water market. This is a market which takes a free good (water) which is generally considered too cheap to meter, and sets a relatively outrageous price on it. The markup is justified through the packaging, quality assurance process, and a general insistence on part of the producer that the bottled water is somehow superior to non-bottled water.<p>What's the answer to bottled water? Supporting bottled water startups? Seeking out and raising awareness of disruptive bottled water producers? I'd say that the answer is simply to not buy bottled water.<p>At this point, you're gonna say that bottled water isn't a good analogy because piracy would equate to stealing pallets of bottled water.

""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."" This is the clause of the Constitution which authorizes Congress to establish copyright. This is the <i>only</i> authority under which copyright may operate: It must be limited, it must be aimed at content <i>creators</i>, not merely redistributors or advertisers; it must promote common culture. The point of copyright, as we historically know, is to ensure that artists can make money without patronization, in order to permit an artist who <i>continually makes work</i> to be remunerated for that work. The idea of a limit on copyright was to ensure that the common culture, the public domain, which was considered more important than the right of an artist to be compensated, would not be ignored; anything which is published will eventually belong to everybody and not any single person or group.<p>Know how long copyright was originally? 14 years plus an optional 14-year renewal, if the author was still alive. That was in 1790, for the ""encouragement of learning."" It was intended for copyright to eventually <i>shrink</i> as distribution improved; after all, why would we need a long copyright when authors are nearly instantly remunerated in this age of speedy international distribution? And now copyright lasts longer than most people.<p>You and I, and everybody else, have minds filled with cultural information. It really should belong to all of us, shouldn't it? Isn't it a damn shame that Mickey Mouse, after three-quarters of a century, being a character our <i>grandparents</i> enjoyed, isn't somebody we can have?

They'll shut down a pseudonymous account when someone brings it to their attention (most notoriously, the Chinese writer who was going on Facebook by his longtime pen name, Michael Anti), but they don't go searching them out.<p>The upshot is that pseudonyms used mainly within circles of friends can exist without getting hassled --- to the point that this commenter on an earlier jwz post, with numerous pseudonymous friends, refused to believe that Facebook even had a ""real names"" policy at all:<p><a href=""http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/08/nym-wars/#comment-93494"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/08/nym-wars/#comment-93494</a><p>(The largest such circle I'm aware of involves dozens of kids with pseudonymous Facebook accounts at a local middle school; I heard about this from a parent, who in turn is aware of it because their kid sometimes forgets to log out.  So much for Zuckerberg's line about pseudonymity being a marginal concern of old fogies.)<p>They certainly could be more aggressive in tying Facebook accounts to real people, for instance, by requiring everyone to ""verify"" with a credit card or mobile number after a certain period of time.

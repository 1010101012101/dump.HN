3628192,comment,3626960,3627917,2,0,0xABADC0DA,,,"> Browsers won't keep SPDY connections open forever in the hopes of someday reusing them; the ""initial connection"" case will happen quite frequently in a normal browsing session.<p>This is what boggles my mind about Spdy, the dissonance.  On the one hand Spdy is great because it does a bunch of requests on the same TCP connection, but on the other hand Spdy is great because it saves 100 bytes per connection and that's a big deal because there are going to be so many connections made?  It doesn't make sense.<p>Spdy is great because it has compression, but on the other hand Spdy is great because it requires SSL which already has compression.  Huh?<p>> I suggested the hopefully very common case of sending a very small request and getting back a very small 304. ... The whole exchange consists entirely of headers ... That would make 121 bytes closer to a 30-40% savings.<p>On a first request only.  You visit some site and only check if exactly one resource?  Not likely.  In any case, the cost to transfer 100 bytes once is irrelevant in any grand scheme of things.<p>> (Also, I'd love to see a reference for your figures on expected bytes saved through the prefix dictionary.)<p><a href=""http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~amer/PEL/poc/pdf/SPDY-Fan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~amer/PEL/poc/pdf/SPDY-Fan.pdf</a><p>The dictionary construction part is suspect though... take a look at how many times the same string length count (\0\0\0\4 for example) occurs in the prefix -- this can't be optimal.",1330063132

It might even be possible to just update to the correct branch and have mercurial automatically try to remerge your changes, though I haven't tried to know for certain. I think you're taking my suggestion way out of context, though I could be misunderstanding you.<p>Mercurial has remote-trackable bookmarks now (something I felt they needed for a long time). I agree Mercurial's branch tracking in general isn't nearly as good as git's, local branches being the biggest example. There is a local branch extension for mercurial (<a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/LocalbranchExtension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/LocalbranchExtension</a>), but having used it a long time ago I'm not sure I'm the biggest fan.<p>However, I firmly believe that mercurial is in the same league as git and both are more than good enough to get the job done, and each have their relative strengths and weaknesses. I also believe that the outspoken part of the git community tends to be overzealous and blind to git's faults and Mercurial's strengths.",1330060575

They can also build custom engines by assembling parts. Sure they can't match quality of a guy who can build everything from scratch, but get enough quality of build useful things.

Unless someone really enjoys talking and being listened.<p>I enjoy discussion with colleagues. I find, though, if more than 4 persons are involved, it is more efficient to be in a formal place or follow a formal procedure. Otherwise, 90% of time tends to be on trivial issues.<p>If lunch together is for socializing, I don't see why twice a week is not enough. I worked in such an environment before and the topics during lunch were mostly the same everyday. Most topics were not interesting. To be fair, it is hard to have an interesting or insightful talk with 10 people. The talks that made me think and made me intrigued were always with 1 or 2 colleagues. We can go out for a drink. If the topic is work-related, we can have a 15 minutes coffee break and discuss it.<p>I understand that lunch is also supposed to give people a break after working hard for 3~4 hours. But lunch together might not be a break for some people. Sometimes after constantly working for 3 hours, especially if the work requires me to be very concentrated, I just want to have a quiet lunch time, to relax, to read 20 minutes of history or other books to adjust my brain, to plan what to do in the afternoon, or walk in the sun for 10 minutes. At these occasions, lunch together and talking to other people only make me exhausted.<p>People are different. It is fine, though, if the boss wants to establish this lunch-together culture and exercise the cookie-cutter. There are always start-ups that don't require this.",1330059871

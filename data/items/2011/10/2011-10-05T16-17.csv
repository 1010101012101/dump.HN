That's probably what would happen if the iPhone had no competition, seeing how even with strong competition from Android, they still don't seem to care about using the same phone over and over again.<p>What's funny is that when HTC releases a more ""refined"" design (but still basically the same), the media is all ""oh, same old design from HTC"". But when Apple does it, ""well, they are just refining a work of art!"" or ""It's the inside that counts!""<p>Yeah right.

In this update, they decided to completely re-write the camera function. Upon starting the camera up, youll notice some rich new features. Those include an auto tilt-shift feature, a new icon that fits beautifully in your mobile devices homescreen, 4 great new photo filters, and many others. Now you may be thinking Version 2.0? Shouldnt that be a complete re-vamp of everything?, but the answer really would be no. There really would have been no point in revamping the whole thing! Ive never heard a single complaint about Instagrams UI. Even people that dont  necessarily care for the app still cant complain about the UI. I think thats why they didnt revamp the whole thing. Like MG of TechCrunch said in his blog post, Why fix something thats not broken?
And thats how I think Instagram got to where they are today.  I absolutely love the fact that Instagram  never took the all at once approach to their app. Some companies just decide to launch worldwide the first day, put every good idea they have into their app, and just hope for a good user response. With Instagram, they decided to add 1 or 2 awesome things in every new update, instead of throwing everything they have out on the table. That was the perfect approach.  Little by little, thats how they became the Instagram we know and love today.<p>Keep doing what youre doing, guys. Congrats on all the success!",1317831595

But many of us with any sense of reasoning and logic regarding Apple have pretty much known that this update was going to be almost exactly what it was. Apple is on a two year design plan. Excuse the original iPhone since that was the exception (again, not that the iPhone 5 couldn't have been one as well). But if you look at it now, it becomes a lot more clear. iPhone 3G-> iPhone 3GS (Faster processor, more ram and the same design). iPhone 4->iPhone 4S (Faster processor, probably more ram, same design).<p>Next year we'll see a new case design, and maybe it'll resemble the tapered design that has been rumored. I'm kind of hoping against it since it would be awkward to hold in landscape orientation. Something that is curved in both directions would be neat. As long as it is symetrical. The problem with a ""banana"" shape is that it would no longer sit flat on a desk and that would bother me.<p>I'm pretty happy with the iPhone4/4S case. I kind of wish it was a bit more curved on the edges since I find the metal ""mid-case"" to be a bit sharp, not a cut you kind of sharp, but it could be more blunt and thus more comfortable in your hand.

I think a bigger issue is that smartphones are turning into a mature product and there's simply less revolution to be had.<p>But my gut is with the many other people who have voiced similar intuitions:  this feels a lot like the mid-90's, when Apple stagnated in the face of clear motion in the industry, chasing old markets while new ones opened.  Is the iPhone 4S the new Centris?",1317830505

I suck at hand writing but type like a champ, and feel that ""whiteboard"" coding is more of an exercise for those who were TAs in college than someone who can show how to really code in person.<p>About 1/2 the time my suggestion to write live code was shot down.  I do fine on the whiteboard, just hate it.",1317830481

Unix wasn't exactly the purist ivory tower to begin with, then it merged with the partially compatible BSD, then we got some not-quite-Smalltalk GUIs on top of that, and now we're building elaborate web stacks on top (and/or instead) of that. And I don't even want to talk about mobile apps that in an almost unholy ceremony combine that again<p>It's a Babylonian tower made of mud (some would say camel poo).

Quantification is king.<p>Too often, however, it's horribly abused.<p>Often we seem to disregard some portion of the non-, or not easily, quantifiable.<p>This leads to all sorts of what we could at times call extra-code-icular 'premature-optimizations' or, as they were once called - 'fails.'<p>For example that ""buns"" component. In any given circumstance there are a massive swath of other factors I've rarely seen cited but need consideration. Throw in some non-/difficult to quantify factors of both risk and opportunity loss and then try to imagine potential impacts on that extrapolated low looking number, because there's always risk and always opportunity cost.<p>Take the spiffy chair and consider the potential that for some reason or other you in one of your pivots or planned or unplanned contingencies find the need to travel or base operations for a time out of a different location.<p>How's that chair equation working out now that you've got to transport it to another location? How comfy is it as you're coding on the other side of the continent from your home office because either a co-founder or an investor or a client or some other previously unknowable factor has popped up?<p>I'm not speaking as some great guru but a poor sap who's realized how many times I've upsold myself for functionality or opportunity that I've never come close to even breaking even on.<p>I know that quantitative analysis is a seductive siren. But realize that for all the beauty and power and reach of our linear equations we, to give old Rummy a shout out, ""don't know what we don't know, and that realization should play into all of your analytics.<p>Your numbers will fail if they are all you lean on. Think outside the quantifiable and learn to respect the gut and differentiate it from an over active desire to analyze yourself away from it and common sense.<p>Just because we're well reasoned folk doesn't make us impervious to marketing tricks' least of all the ones we play on ourselves landing on our own ptosis",1317830411

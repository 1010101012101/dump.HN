All of them worked a job that involved the manipulation of symbols and abstractions for the purpose of assisting other people in their jobs of manipulating symbols and abstractions.<p>Whatever is my point? you are surely asking yourself. It is this: good system designers engineer their systems around the assumption that sysadmins might screw up, and mitigate the damages.<p>Sometimes that means explicit confidentiality measures in logs, or in obfuscation or outright encryption of user data. More often it means that the only way to even access logs or spools is to stage through a management server (for instance via SSH forwarding) that is heavily audited. Some people have ""two key"" systems that require admins to cross-check each other before potentially coming into contact with hazmat.<p>This is what we should discussing.

This does of course exacerbate the original error of not keeping that data backed up, but I still felt the need to help her out.<p>So, I sat there and I thought about it for a very long time, reverse engineering the process of exactly what happens during a head crash on a hard disk platter, the head collides with the spinning platter causing physical damage to it and/or getting jammed on it and unable to reset.<p>Opening the drive and physically realigning the components required tools and an environment that I did not have access to, I did not have the spare parts to implement a platter switch out on a spare of the same model drive, and no clean room environment to do the job at any rate, so I thought <i>if this were a simulation of reality and I could just magic it back like in software, how might I do that</i> and got the image of lifting the head off the platter to reset it without opening the drive casing.<p>Thinking about it a bit longer made me come up with the crazy idea that the disk was constructed of metal, and metal contracts when cooled. Possibly this could result in the head being lifted off the platter for long enough for the disk spin up to realign the head if it was booted quickly after being cooled dramatically, but condensation would destroy the electronics on the drive and this would need to be accounted for.<p>It's kind of a crazy idea anyway and if the data is really critical and it could've been sent to a recovery specialist I would've recommended that but on hearing my idea she immediately begged me to do it. Apparently she had no idea what I was actually proposing beyond it involves the freezer and the disk or why it might work, but afterward she told me that I had that same cautiously optimistic vocal tone I get when I'm on the edge of a solved problem when we're working together and that was enough to convince her it was a surefire winner.<p>So, multiple freezer bags wrapping the drive and four hours later with said freezer on lowest temperature it was capable of, I quickly removed the drive, cut a hole in the outer bag that had not been covering the power and data connections, and put it into the system, spin up, no clicks. Rapidly booted into linux live CD and copied all the files off the drive, it kept running not only for the three hours necessary to do this, but apparently runs to this very day also (this was about three years ago).<p>She does however backup religiously now, and doesn't store anything critical on that drive anymore, and this incident was the genesis of a new dropbox customer. ;)",1284592833

One big problem is that XP has all the features most users need and a big price tag on windows 7 doesn't help. Every windows before XP ended up having large game breaking issues which meant the customer base would switch quiet fast to the new one when it came out. Sure windows 7 is a nice addition on top of XP but in terms of day to day usage most people would easily be able to get by on XP.",1284591734

There may already be a node based dns server out there, found a couple references, and am hoping the web platform is very minimal, letting me extend it later without changing the appliance itself.<p>As i dig into it more, I may have some contributions to CouchApp to make, but may just end up making the node part of it a separate open source project. Not sure if ill need to hack couchapp or not.<p>Edit: reread your comment. Will start just with couch, then add couch apps, then add simple node server front end, look at node based frameworks, then add executing js in node from the couch, then redis for caching, then add the load balancing, logging and see what features I need for apps.",1284591657

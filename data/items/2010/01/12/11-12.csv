It was in a location where the traffic was often banked back.   I wondered how many people sat in their cars, read that sign, and threw in their job when they got to work.

To date, this is the state-of-the-art in fighting spam effectively (to my knowledge), since it impacts their revenue stream instead of an ever-escalating technological arms-race. Unfortunately, they went bust, when the black-hats started DDOSing them out. (My datasource at that time was, unfortunately, slashdot; please correct for any biases / false data).<p>Has there been any development on this front? Anyone tried replicating their model?<p>(I understand if it doesn't seems a lucrative idea to this bunch; I'm just saying, there are a couple of well defined sources in my spambox, I would be willing to part with good money to see them eliminated. )",1263296408

1047290,comment,1047084,1047084,0,0,Mz,,,"I think making it personal like that would cause a great many more problems than it would solve.  For articles, I upvote them as a means to ""save"" them.  I think that's a more objective means to measure value:  I vote on articles to serve my own needs (because I value them), not to express an opinion or agreement/disagreement.  I have no idea what could be done to the system of voting on individual comments which would more closely align to that rubric.<p>I would rather not know if some individual is routinely downvoting me.  There is no way to determine if such a pattern arises out of personal dislike/spitefulness or just coincidence that they see the world very differently from me and therefore just happen to strongly disagree with many things I say.  But the ability to check for/notice such patterns would likely begin negatively impacting discussions here as it would promote ""feuds"" which likely would not remain confined to voting patterns.  I've seen a few comments that suggest that there are running battles here between specific individuals, but you get that everywhere and it seems less toxic and less obvious here than what I have witnessed elsewhere.<p>For that matter, it also might not be a good thing to know one person routinely upvotes someone in particular.",1263296107

1047280,comment,1046388,1046388,0,0,scottdw2,,,"Personally, I don't value software parents much.<p>I think they are a giant waste of money. You spend $20K on lawyers, to get nothing more than the right to spend more money on lawyers in the future.<p>That $20K could be better invested elsewhere (like on product improvement).<p>I think it would be worth considering eliminating software patents.<p>However, I don't think an ""independent invention defense"" is a good idea. It would essentially eliminate all patent protection. Basically, the absence of proof that you knew a patent existed, would get you off the hook for infringing on it. This means that as long as you had the right set of rigorous policies in place, you could operate with complete immunity from patent infringement claims.<p>If all employees were trained (by mandatory corporate training) that ""under no circumstances should you ever read any patents, ever"", and ""if you ever have any doubts about anything being patentable, direct the question to our lawyer"", and you were very strict about enforcing it, you could make a case that pretty much every invention was discovered independently.<p>That would defeat the whole purpose of patent protection. The idea is that by getting inventors to disclose details of their invention (which benefits society), that they get a monopoly on its use. Without the monopoly, there is no point in having a patent.<p>If software patents pose a fundamental problem, then I think the best course of action is to eliminate software parents, not to undermine the entire patent system.",1263294997

The entire point of the article was saying that Google is trying to make money by creating new opportunities for innovation by forcing standards to be higher. That does not equal ""<i>just want that more people will use internet, and for longer time.</i>""<p>For one- I would like to see you connect buying radio stations to using the internet `<i>for longer time</i>.`\nAnd for two- I would be shocked if Google's only business model was ""Create things which will force people to look at more of our ads"".<p>On a similar side-note. Youtube has very little advertisement- especially compared to sites like Megavideo and Hulu (kinda not related). So advertisement must not be the number one priority always.

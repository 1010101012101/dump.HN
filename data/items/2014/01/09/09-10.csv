It was as part of a set of workshops, organised on the occasion of my country of origin joining the EU. I think I saw close to a hundred maps of the world drawn in a similar manner, by young high school students, with a fairly diverse educational background (it was a public school, and there is no income differentiation between them -- schools were  financed solely based on the number of pupils).<p>There was plenty of eurocentrism in them, <i>but</i> notably:<p>* NONE OF THEM MISSED FUCKING JAPAN.

How the fuck do you miss Greenland? It&#x27;s a huge fucking white spot straight near Canada, it&#x27;s literally impossible to miss it. The only way you can miss Greenland is if you never fucking looked at a world map.<p>* None of them simply warped Asia and Africa. That&#x27;s probably because of a peculiarity of language -- there is a strong distinction in my native tongue between the Asian continent and the peninsulae in the Middle East. Some students did miss one or two of the unspeakable number of seas in there, but the Arabian peninsula could clearly be seen as such, and it was distinct from the Indian subcontinent.<p>* None of them missed... Madagascar. How the fuck do you miss Madagascar? There&#x27;s a movie with cute penguins made after it!<p>Notable omissions were the myriad of isles between Indonesia and Australia, the Behring strait was usually larger than it should have been (probably because it gets skewed in different manners under different map projections), the Carribean islands were all joined into a single, large Cuba and Kamchatka was absent in about a third of those maps.

That&#x27;s pretty much the only course where students are expected to prove theorems about the subject via proofs. In most of the other courses students are taught the formulas and techniques, axioms and theorems, but then apply them, rather than attempt to develop or prove them themselves. They&#x27;re also, typically, not shown a proof of the theorems they learn, they&#x27;re just told to accept them.<p>Wow! I can&#x27;t even imagine how that works. When I went to school (and that&#x27;s in Europe, not Asia), the notions of theorem and proof were taught in the fifth year of school (out of 12 pre-college years -- 8 in elementary, 4 in high school). That was, indeed, as part of geometry. Starting from high school, however, pretty much no formula is given without prior demonstration. Subjects where they <i>can&#x27;t</i> do that (like mechanics -- that&#x27;s taught in Physics prior to pre-calculus and calculus) are a royal fuckup. You aren&#x27;t usually expected to be able to reproduce the proofs for those formulae, but a) you&#x27;re strongly encouraged to study them, because they help you with the exercises and b) it&#x27;s usually implied that, if you can&#x27;t remember the formula, but you can prove it, it&#x27;s OK. For example, if you can&#x27;t finish a problem in a test because you don&#x27;t know the formula, but you obviously try to find it, the professor will sometimes give you full credit, depending on circumstances and following a short talk.<p>I didn&#x27;t even <i>like</i> math back then, save for geometry, but I reckon this was the most important thing I learned there. Unless you&#x27;re dumber than a toaster, you&#x27;re typically able to apply what you learned to everyday phenomenae after ten years of school; the bonus you get is also being able to reason rigorously and correctly, which is an important takeaway no matter what path you choose to follow.",1389258446

I have 3 Stripe accounts and don&#x27;t have a problem with password management, due to having LastPass, but answering simple questions like &quot;How much money should I expect to receive in transfers in the next week?&quot; requires me to do three context switches and then math.  (Also, mentioned this to support years ago, but even on a single account there&#x27;s no &quot;sum of scheduled transfers&quot; on the transfer page, which has always struck me like a number likely to be of interest to many people.)<p>This is a priority for me which is annoying enough to mention and to have bought various Stripe reporting apps speculatively, hoping one would implement it, but below the cusp of &quot;Screw it, I&#x27;ll figure out how to use the reporting API then do summary stats on a cron job and dump them onto one of my dashboards.&quot;",1389258427

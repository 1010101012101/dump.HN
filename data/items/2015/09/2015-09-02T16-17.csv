(i do not endorse this practice - but i am perhaps a little bitter because i am usually the one who spots these things and has to deal with them).",1441213189

Yes, PayPal has currently, and always has had, crappy practices when it comes to customer service and disputes. That&#x27;s not news in my books and comes as absolutely no surprise.<p>Where I got lost though is the selling of an extremely valuable asset such as shop.com (a four-letter, dictionary, brandable, .com domain) at well under value. The first lesson in fraud detection is that if it seems to good to be true it probably is. A domain that probably has a value at close to a $1M going for under $1000 would fit the definition of too good to be true. Yeah, partners break up and can do some angry things, but selling an asset at such a heavily discounted price would certainly be shocking to me. A little more due diligence on buyer side would have prevented this. Otherwise I have a 100 foot yacht and an ocean front property in Nevada for sale for $1000 if you are interested. :) I mean even PayPal warns flat out warns about these types of transactions (<a href=""https://www.paypal.com/eBay/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/fraud-tips-buyers-outside"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com/eBay/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/fraud-t...</a>)<p>To me this entire story is like saying I went to Walmart and parked my car. They have security cameras in the parking lot and I asked an employee if those cameras were monitored. The employee told me yes so I left the windows down in my car with my laptop and a wallet full of cash on the seat. I was only going in the store for a minute and I felt assured that if anyone stole them I could easily identify them and get my stuff back. When I came out everything was gone. When I asked the security guard to review the footage I could not see who the people were and could not identify them. I am now going to complain about Walmart&#x27;s security practices because of this incident.<p>The good news for the OP is that at least he has ads on his site and I am sure the traffic he is getting from this post he may make back a few of those lost dollars in ad revenue :)",1441212871

Even where there is demonstrated and measured irrationality in individual decisions though, in aggregate the distortion effects tend to be minimized.<p>Outside of these known areas of completixity and modeling deficiency, there have been several major breakthroughs in modeling and understanding other seemingly puzzling factors.

I think a combination of using square tiles where each one is Z-ordered is probably a useful combination.<p>For my ray tracer I use a single counter to scan all the pixels in an image. I feed the counter into a &quot;deinterleave&quot; function to split it into an X and Y coordinate before shooting a ray. That way the image is rendered in Z-order.

There once was a Steve Martin bit about doing one show for 1000 people for $1000 a ticket [or something like that] and then retiring. 20 restaurants at $50 a month would get you to $1000. Supporting those 20 customers will almost certainly be less effort than 50 customers @ $20/month.<p>That said, I suspect the reason scheduling wait staff is such a mess is that wait staff are people and hence unpredictable, unreliable, opinionated and moody. On top of that, the ideal scheduling solution from the scheduler&#x27;s point of view is almost certainly an automatic tool, but that requires all those <i>people</i> on the wait staff to enter accurate information...and the odds of that happening in the average ten staff restaurant that&#x27;s looking for a solution is probably zero.<p>Finally, it is probably the case that scheduling by paper and pencil or excel requires zero cash directly. The manager is on salary and does the scheduling in slack times and Excel is already a sunk cost. Again, even a $10/month SAAS is competing with zero.<p>Good luck.",1441212277

The pattern you describe results in systematic alienation of a huge chunk of our population, all kinds of social problems (including crime), and more practically a <i>loss</i> to both the companies and our country when we ignore our potential, top performers. The Navy example cited showed the women were outperforming the men left and right but the bias prevented them from moving up. Had more moved up before, the Navy would&#x27;ve possibly been more effective across the board and would continue as their judgement applied to the next group of candidates.<p>Every study I looked at on diversity in the workplace showed positive results from the more diverse workplaces. Let&#x27;s not hypothesize as you did when there&#x27;s real examples to draw on. In tech, the workplaces of larger companies that are rated best for women specifically include Facebook, Google, Qualcomm, Intel, Texas Instruments, Apple, and Microsoft. Know what they have in common? They own entire markets with massive bankrolls and constant adaptation despite highly-competitive markets that bankrupt many other firms. Might blow your mind that using the best talent rather than just white, males translates to better business decisions, better tech, more money, a healthier economy, and so on. It&#x27;s why the Nordic countries <i>voluntarily</i> did quotas in high-level business and government positions when they saw the same problem. They don&#x27;t need quotas now that things are more even and the results were similarly good.<p>Now, back to your made-up example. The most successful, innovative Asian companies open up operations in many countries hiring locals for operations, marketing, and R&D. They mix talent and ideas from all of them. They also acquire foreign companies for their I.P. and talent. The result: they make billions dominating markets. Toyota, Samsung, and Fujitsu come to mind. On other hand, there are companies like your all-Asian, male firm that avoids all other types: they&#x27;re called factories and service firms that barely make it to No 4 in their non-innovative industries. In America, we should aim a bit higher and not be left behind by foreign competition. Starting in Silicon Valley...",1441211997

The evidence shows just the opposite. We are not going to solve the problem of waste by focusing on plastic bags. With larger mammals it&#x27;s fishing gear that&#x27;s the big problem. On a global basis plastic bags aren&#x27;t an issue.&quot;<p>- Most plastic bags are made with natural gas, and not oil (and even if it were oil, 100 billion bags would be less oil than American consumes in one day)<p>- Ultimately, the amount (in tons) of reusable bags thrown in landfills every year is greater than that of plastic bags.<p>- Reusable bags can be unsanitary and have led to an outbreak of norovirus (and I assume other incidents as well, although no other figures were provided)<p>I do think this is sufficient evidence to oppose bans on plastic bags (although -- as I said before -- I am biased). In order to make something illegal, a very strong case should be made against it. Banning plastic bags would have virtually no effect on liter, global warming, landfills, or animals life.

Most heads of state and policy pushers seek to, at minimum, ensure their country keeps its current level of global influence & power. Generally this holds true whether one is right or left, but some ideological views result in different policies.<p>A population contraction breaks most existing economic models. You can&#x27;t borrow money for infrastructure improvements. Tax revenues shrink. Housing prices go down.<p>The more cynical observer may suspect that its an attempt to break some of the social welfare systems and replace them with more capitalistic alternatives.

Two or three generations forward, there should be more resources and economic wealth to make up for this.<p>An even more cynical observer may believe that the US is trying to destabilize the Middle East because this could have a negative influence on the great powers which threaten global American dominance -- Russia, China, and Europe. There may not be any logistical way for Europe to throttle the influx of refugees. Rather than setting policy Europe is just trying to manage it the best they can.

The thing the preventative ones all have in common is they impose control on the flow of information in such as way as to prevent attacks. Separation, like address spaces, is a recurring concept and technique but not the only one. So, I use the term &quot;information flow control&quot; albeit it might be used differently in academia. The other model, covered by diversity and obfuscation, is to create a disconnect between what attacker envisions and what they can accomplish to create probabilistic security. The first is great against &quot;known knowns&quot; and &quot;known unknowns:&quot; specific attacks or non-specific worries in known risk areas. The second is great against straight unknowns, esp tricks nation states devise. Combining the two is most powerful and hence my recommendation. Many models of each, which further muddles things for attackers.<p>Far as Tinfoil Chat, I&#x27;ve recommended it heartily as a project to use and improve. Markus Ottela took what he learned from prior work and our comments at Schneier&#x27;s blog (esp on data diodes & physical separation) to create a unique, solid design. He&#x27;s been posting on the blog for feedback for months, we&#x27;ve suggested many risk mitigations (eg polyciphers, continuous transmission), and he&#x27;s integrated about every one into his system. Most just ignore such things or make excuses: Markus is 1 in a 1,000 in (a) applying what&#x27;s proven and (b) not letting problems become legacy &quot;features.&quot;<p>So, yeah, I recommend it. Once my personal situation stabilizes, I plan to reimplement it with a tiny TCB on appropriate devices. I&#x27;m probably going to do a portable implementation of Send for microcontroller-style systems. Receive will be a Linux box hardened with virtualization or obfuscation security methods. Genode if it&#x27;s up to it by then. The transport will be a more hardened, cheap box with just that functionality. I&#x27;m going to use CHERIBSD, if possible, just to experiment with it. Might replace the raw, serial links with MCU&#x27;s or FPGA&#x27;s for higher-speed, one-way I/O. Optical is highly likely (good guess). Eventually, I&#x27;m going to put it in an appliance with several, cheap boards so it&#x27;s all integrated.<p>On my extensive backlog for now. But, yes, it&#x27;s one of the best and practically has no TCB. Great design. Can be reused for email, audio, video, and maybe filesharing. Will be my interim framework until my next high-assurance system is ready.",1441210691

A lifetime of rationalization does not make it not so.  So perhaps talk to an ADHD specialist - it can make a huge difference in your life, and your loved ones.<p>Ask someone diagnosed in later life, say, over 40, if they would have preferred to not be rationalizing and suffering the consequences over the last 20 to 30 years.",1441210623

10160213,comment,10158782,10158782,0,0,geebee,,,"I&#x27;d like to start by thanking Anna (the author of this post) for identifying and writing about something that I consider to be a very serious problem in tech.  While I disagree about some of the details, I&#x27;m in complete agreement that hiring practices (among other things) are a serious in our industry, and I feel increasing frustration with an industry that constantly talks about a &quot;shortage&quot; of talent while tolerating or even perpetuating practices that (in my opinion) clearly drive away talented people.<p>I recently went through the interview gauntlet, including (at one company) five hours of whiteboard exercises with a short break for lunch.  While I can&#x27;t post exact interview questions, I would say that the difficult level questions from &quot;cracking the coding interview&quot; and other sites are probably indicative of the difficulty level of my interview.  For example &quot;find the least common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree&quot; or &quot;find the sub matrix with the larges sum in an NXM matrix&quot; would be pretty typical questions (though of course you won&#x27;t know the questions in advance).   This is at the whiteboard, no programming environment to try things out,  under time pressure, in what can only reasonably be called a stressful environment.  Many people who took difficult in-person exams consider these to be among their most stressful academic experiences.  In software, we consider this to be a normal part of changing jobs.<p>I agree with Anna that the amount of preparation is considerable.  I brushed up on data structures and algorithms, but I only allowed myself three weeks (I&#x27;m employed full time, married, have kids, coach soccer, shuttle kids around to music practices, and so forth, so getting time to study isn&#x27;t as easy as it used to be).  I should have asked for three <i>months</i>.  I did get the basics back, so I could implement various tree traversals, code up a hash map, do dfs and bfs on a tree, solve binary problems, but I just didn&#x27;t get fluid enough to do this in a creative way at a whiteboard (On the bright side, I actually enjoyed the work, and I still study these things now.  I&#x27;m probably much stronger now than I was when I did my interviews.  I actually kind of like challenging data structure problems, it&#x27;s a side of programming that I kind of missed).<p>But here&#x27;s what I learned from the experience: where it comes to <i>interviewing</i> and getting a job, you really need to be exceptionally strong on the basics if you&#x27;re going to be able to solve these kinds of problems at a whiteboard in a 45 minute interview.  I know you can look up DFS, but only if you have a while to solve a problem, under less time pressure.  I you need to use DFS to solve a related problem that you haven&#x27;t seen before, in 45 minutes, at the whiteboard… you just need to know this cold.  You need to be read to apply it cold.  I&#x27;m not defending the interview process here, I&#x27;m just trying to explain to people what they need to do to be prepped for these interviews.<p>Now, I do have a few disagreements with Anna&#x27;s article, in particular around the solution of the &quot;take home&quot;.   Although I&#x27;m sympathetic to the idea of a &quot;take home&quot; exam rather than an in person, and I see some benefits, ultimately, I don&#x27;t like this approach.  This is partly because of my own personal experiences - I once spent the requested 5-7 hours on a homework assignment, sent it back to the recruiter, and heard nothing back, crickets chirping, aside from checking in with the recruiter politely even week or so, until I got a one sentence call back (again from the recruiter, never did talk to a developer) &quot;we&#x27;ve decided not to move forward with your application at this time&quot;.  I think Gayle Laakman McDowell wrote a very good summary of how this practice can become abusive - ultimately, her argument is rooted in the way it allows companies to burn a lot of a candidate&#x27;s time without a comparable investment themselves, here&#x27;s the full link:<p><a href=""http://www.gayle.com/blog/2013/09/18/companies-who-give-candidates-homework-assignments-knock-it-off"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gayle.com/blog/2013/09/18/companies-who-give-cand...</a><p>To me, I think the first thing we need to do is recognize that any &quot;shortage&quot; that tech companies are experiencing needs to be considered in the context of how tech hires.  A cynical part of me thinks that this process did exactly what it was intended to do, that it&#x27;s not about whether a candidate can find all matching subtrees in a binary tree, it&#x27;s whether that candidate can afford to drop everything to get into such mental/coding shape that they are able to do this at the whiteboard.  If they can&#x27;t, perhaps that&#x27;s a sign that they have life demands that are incompatible with what tech companies are looking for?<p>This has been a long comment, thanks to everyone who read this far.  I do think tech has a long way to go.  The problems run much deeper than the solutions I hear about from silicon valley &quot;leaders&quot;.  Until tech addresses these problems on a much more fundamental level, expect those with choice (ie., those aren&#x27;t compelled to study certain subjects and work certain jobs as a condition of getting to live and work in the US) to continue to avoid this field in favor of other professions and trades.<p>I do think that the recent focus on tech hiring is a positive sign that we&#x27;re starting to look beyond superficial fixes (&quot;make programming cool!&quot;) and more deeply at the process itself.<p>Here&#x27;s another very good blog post that addresses this: <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3043082/most-creative-people/why-software-maker-fog-creek-is-helping-its-competitors-hire-women"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/3043082/most-creative-people/why-...</a>).",1441210358

There&#x27;s been articles all over the internet on how horrible their CS is and pretty blatantly discribes their bad practices and how they haven&#x27;t gotten any better. I&#x27;m just surprised people refuse to use alternatives for online payments.  Even if paypal says you&#x27;re protected, if you didn&#x27;t use a Credit Card through their service to make the purchase it&#x27;s kind of the author&#x27;s fault for trusting Paypal to be competent at being able to resolve this issue even after it was blatantly going to be a scam.<p>tldr; I find it pretty hard to feel compassion for the author here.",1441209696

10160130,comment,10158993,10159665,0,0,jfindley,,,"I wrote a PoC app [0] a while ago to do just this - allow storing and sharing of keys, with the server holding the encrypted keys never seeing the decryption key.<p>Sharing a key involves downloading it from the server, asymetrically encrypting it with the public key of the reciever, and uploading to the server again. It also allowed sharing with groups via intermediate keys decrypt-able by multiple users.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s just a PoC - noone should use it for actually important data, and I certainly don&#x27;t promise that it&#x27;s actually secure - but it does (more or less) work.
As it requires client-side crypto, it&#x27;s not an ideal candidate for a web-service either (although one could potentially use browser extensions to make that more reasonable).<p>0: <a href=""https://github.com/jfindley/skds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jfindley/skds</a>",1441209660

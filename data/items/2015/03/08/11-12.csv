You can&#x27;t look at a byte sequence and say that &quot;it&#x27;s random&quot;.<p>Interestingly, this is less true than you might think. The mathematics of Kolmogorov complexity[1] formalizes the idea that a given finite fixed string is &quot;random&quot;. In this framework, you can have a byte sequence that definitely is random. (However, your second sentence I quoted is still technically true here as well because it is algorithmically undecidable how random the string is.)<p>(In fact one of the definitions of a random string is one that is incompressible, i.e. there is no algorithm with shorter description than the string that produces the string.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity</a>",1425815758

9165273,comment,9164881,9165112,0,0,dalke,,,"I question your statement &quot;a MOOC degree ought to be infinitely more worthwhile than any traditional college degree&quot;. (Taking &quot;infinitely&quot; to mean &quot;at least twice&quot;.)<p>Do you have any evidence for that? That is, there&#x27;s very little research to back that up. For example, <a href=""http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1902/3009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1902/300...</a> compared the two systems and found that they were roughly the same, in terms of outcomes.<p>However, that&#x27;s based on completing the course. From the paper, &quot;Although approximately 17,000 people signed-up for 8.MReV, most dropped out with no sign of commitment to the course; only 1500 students were “passing” or on-track to earn a certificate after the second assignment. For the IRT analysis we included only the 1,080 students who attempted more than 50% of the questions in the course, 95% of whom earned certificates. Most of those completing less than 50% of the homework and quiz problems dropped out during the course and did not take the posttest, so their learning could not be measured.&quot;<p>Further, &quot;It is also important to note the many gross differences between 8.MReV and on-campus education. Our self-selected online students are interested in learning, considerably older, and generally have many more years of college education than the on-campus freshmen with whom they have been compared. The on-campus students are taking a required course that most have failed to pass in a previous attempt. Moreover, there are more dropouts in the online course (but over 50% of students making a serious attempt at the second weekly test received certificates) and these dropouts may well be students learning less than those who remained. The pre- and posttest analysis is further blurred by the fact that the MOOC students could consult resources before answering, and, in fact, did consult within course resources significantly more during the posttest than in the pretest.&quot;<p>This reads like <i>if</i> a student finishes a course then there isn&#x27;t much difference based on how they learned the material. Hardly the sign of a &#x27;radically superior&#x27; education system.",1425814205

9165259,comment,9163782,9163782,0,0,logicallee,,,"In terms of behavior, we know Mike acted in bad faith: before he saw the approach, he had agreed that the challenger could use multiple files.  But once the challenger had posted them, he proceeded to download only a single file to verify its functionality, not touching the others.  It shows bad faith on the part of Mike when he chose to ignore the other files.<p>By the way in a theoretical sense Mike lost when he said he would allow multiple files and count their sizes: this is because [] is not the same as [[][][]], but consists of 3 empty sets.  You can theoretically encode a file into just a bunch of 0-byte files, without using the order of the files or their names.  He shouldn&#x27;t have agreed to count only their sizes.<p>For the theoretical encoding into 0-sized files, you can simply interpret the input file as a binary number, and then create that many empty files.<p>This is not a practical solution of course - you can only compress two bytes down to 0-byte files this way, as 2^16-1 is already up to 65535 empty files.  For three bytes it&#x27;s up to 16,777,215 files.<p>If you wanted to store 9 bytes in unary as the number of empty files, you would need 2^72-1 = 4.7 sextillion (million quadrillion) files.  Obviously that is not actually possible.  But even 9 bytes is hardly enough to interpret the files as binary again.  (Unless you can somehow get Mike to agree to the invocation - since the decompression program itself doesn&#x27;t need to store any information and theoretically could be 0, 1 or 2 bytes.)  But theoretically you don&#x27;t need anything other than what Mike foolishly agreed to: allowing multiple output files counting their sizes.<p>2.<p>There is also another theoretical way to make money off of Mike, but it is not practical.  (It doesn&#x27;t work.)  If we were not limited to bytes but could use bits, you could shave up to 5 bits off of every input file, if you figured out a way to decompress it by always prepending the bits 00000.  (Theoretically there is only 1 pigeonhole to decompression, so you do not need to store any information in the decompression algorithm and it has no minimum size).<p>If Mike is using a random source for the files, this would result in a correct decompression in 1/32 of cases.  But Mike is giving 49:1 odds (risk $100, get $5000), which is better than 31:1.  So you could simply repeat the game with Mike thousands of times, always using the same decompression algorithm, until you have all of Mike&#x27;s money.  This works better if Mike is a computer, of course.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t work at all on any actual systems, as a nibble is less than a byte and would not count as savings even if you could encode the decompression algorithm into a 0-byte (or up to 3 bit) invocation.",1425813464

I couldn&#x27;t get any response at all from the company, so I called a few numbers and eventually a random developer at Google looked up and gave me the name and phone number for the director of Google Checkout.  I posted the number in a few forums where other incredibly frustrated merchants were looking for help.<p>Instead of getting some people to respond to the messages these people apparently left, within a day, the number was disconnected.  <i>That</i> is how they tend to deal with customer service issues.",1425813257

Even more often, they&#x27;re not properly chained, in a way that breaks the interaction if you&#x27;re doing something else while the animation is still completing its cycle. If the animation is is actually masking a delay, you can <i>bet</i> the animation is <i>not</i> interrupted and/or sped-up when the data is ready.<p>There are <i>very</i> few cases were animations provide visual cues which are actually an improvement. Very, <i>very</i> few. Touch interaction benefits for more visual feedback (such as sliding), but note that sliding in my eyes is not an animation as should be directly linked with the position of the finger.<p>In the last years I&#x27;ve been aggressively disabling all kind of animations in software which serve no actual purpose. Sadly, this kind of stuff often cannot be disabled.",1425813231

When you actually hold them and use them you would never mistake them for iPhones, any more than you&#x27;d mistake a $500 coat or bag for the $2,000 example that sometimes inspires the colour or trim. You can sometimes see where it came from, but it&#x27;s not the same, nor is it trying to be.

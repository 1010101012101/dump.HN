6597647,comment,6585719,6585719,1,0,guyinblackshirt,,,"When it comes to SaaS sales, I recommend reading SaaStr from Jason Lemkin, ex-Echosign founder (grew business from $0 to $50,000,000, then sold to Adobe). His advice is pure gold.<p>Here is an initial comp plan. Visit his blog for more<p>Competitive Base Salary  But You Cover it (Including Benefits) Before Any Bonus.  Whatever you base is each month  $4k, $6k, $10k, whatever  you first have to bring in the revenue to cover it before you get any bonus.  I.e., no commission at all until you pay off your base salary + benefits, or say 125% of that months base.  Its similar to a draw, but not a true draw  your base salary is a salary.  (True draws are not competitive.)\nBut then, Pay 2x as Much in Commission.  Youll have to figure your own exact model out, but basically for us, I figured if reps paid their base first, and the losers then didnt suck up a lot of cash  I could push the full 20-22% of ACV straight to the rep as commission.  And even more if 80%+ of them all hit their plan.  Its what youd end up paying in the BigCo plan anyway.  So instead of a 10-11% commission, I paid ~25%.  But only once you paid back your base.  (The exact % may vary for you based on your unit economics).\nOne Accelerator:  Cash Up Front.  Paying 25% instead of 10-12%, but only once you pay for your base salary, is itself an inherent accelerator.  The sky is the limit once youve paid your base back.  But there was one thing that mattered when I wanted to be cash-flow positive: cash.  So I paid more for cash-up front deals.  Less for the rest (this may not matter for you if you dont do monthly or quarterly options).  And I paid a partial-to-full commission on any Year 2 cash, upfront.  That cash now was very valuable.\nPayment Upon Receipt of Cash, Not Contract E-Signing.  Later, once we were past $15m or so, this didnt matter so much.  But until then, it was my way of aligning interests.  Ill pay you a lot.  If you perform.  But only once you take care of business and take care of the company.  And get the cash in the door.  Reps hate this.  But if they are going to stay 12+ months  it doesnt matter.  Theyll see that.  Especially if the top reps are driving M6 convertibles.<p>It worked great for me.  There were automatic accelerators.  The sky was the limit for the A+ reps.  There was no need to &quot;ratchet up&quot; the plan.  It rewarded the hungry.   We still had quotas, of course.  Our initial annual ACV quotas varied from $380k or so to about $550k, and we continued to refine this over time as we got better at sales.  But quotas just weren&#x27;t as important, because the plan created the right incentives to hit these numbers and exceed them -- irrespective of what quotas were set.<p>Source: <a href=""http://saastr.quora.com/An-Initial-Sales-Rep-Comp-Plan-to-Lower-Your-Stress-Level-Increase-Cash-and-Make-Everyone-a-Lot-of-Money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://saastr.quora.com/An-Initial-Sales-Rep-Comp-Plan-to-Lo...</a>",1382518050

And you personally (with non MSR people like Jonathan Edwards) are among the few who try to help the crap we call programming which I hope you will pursue for a long time. I follow your research and your comments on HN.<p>On MS (mostly opinion here as most posters in this kind of thread):<p>I used to love MS in the 80s, because of the MSX [1]; to me that all was very open and nice.<p>With Windows 3.1 I saw something different; I was used to unix in university by then and Windows 3.1 was so horribly unstable and generally completely worthless that I thought the world had gone mad from buying and using that crap. I used to look in pity on the people sitting behind the very frequently crashing 3.1 (browsing with Netscape on 3.1 was like pulling teeth) machines as I sat behind Solaris which never crashed. Which made MS, to me, the company who releases things into the wild which do not work <i>and</i> they dare to ask money for it. I know they couldn&#x27;t really help some of that; you could crash 3.1 as easy as DOS, but software under DOS crashed less frequently, wasn&#x27;t that much of a pain to work with (one open application at a time; good for focusing too :). Matters became worse that, after a while, they had NT and still they were peddling, for money!, that 3.1 abomination on humanity.<p>With 95 things didn&#x27;t improve much (at the time it seemed it did and up from 3.1 it did, but in the big scheme of things it still crashed all the time) and by then a solid version of NT was on the market so there was not much excuse for releasing &#x27;95. I became aware of their dubious business tactics against small companies and with their partners; as a result of the technical crap they released and their tactics I got 5 sparcstation 5 machines from my old uni for free and installed redhat on my PC.<p>I try Windows and the eco system ever so often;I have a Lumia; love the hardware, not the OS; many issues I&#x27;ve written about before. I tried to like Windows 7 and 8; 7 is ok, but not more than that and 8 is... weird. I wish they would&#x27;ve just had some balls and just only put Metro  all the way with no way to go back. Now it&#x27;s just, like the Surface; neither meat nor fish; not tablet, not laptop. For a client I had to install the MS-SQL/Sharepoint/Exchange etc stack and write some software on it; I thought I liked it at first, but after a while I got into the quirks which had no documentation and not much online relief.<p>Basically; I try to like MS their products ever so often because I think their should be competition; I just don&#x27;t see any competition compared to what I use daily. And stuff like the Android patents still stings; unless they turn that back they haven&#x27;t changed since the 90s and are still evil.<p>I don&#x27;t &#x27;hate&#x27; anything though; it&#x27;s just something they shouldn&#x27;t do if they want my money.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX</a>",1382515876

6597506,comment,6596038,6596038,3,0,etler,,,"Personally, some of the stuff microsoft has been building recently looks really appealing. I want to give some of their stuff a chance, particularly their direction with tablets. I have a convertible tablet and in college used things like onenote and the text recognition it has is simply amazing, better than anything else I&#x27;ve used. I could stash an image on it, then write on top of it, then search it immediately after! So I think microsoft has had a good track record with tablet technology, and I&#x27;m definitely interested in trying out the new stuff. I haven&#x27;t yet, simply because I haven&#x27;t had a chance to test the new surface pro.",1382515446

So you&#x27;ll go there because reading every single post on Lambda the Ultimate takes too long and you want a community that does the hard work for you of picking out the wheat from the chaff.<p>Then, after about three years, articles that compare the performance of subroutine threading vs. switch statements in interpreters slowly disappear and are replaced by articles about how the new Apple product is ingenious because it&#x27;s the size of most people&#x27;s thumb.  Then comments become shorter, and you realize you no longer read the comments to gain a depth of knowledge.  Where before you were continually amazed at some people&#x27;s insight, now when you ask an honest question you are more likely to be flamed by a nerd with a chip on his shoulder that&#x27;s desperate to start and win an argument.<p>For another year or two occasional glimpses of the better articles and comments keep you coming back, but after a while you start to go looking for the next site that&#x27;s long on interesting and short on raging arrogance.<p>Then, five years after that, you might go back to the old site to see if it ever changed, and instead marvel at the cesspool it&#x27;s become.<p>As a techie, you will have this experience once or twice a decade.

63940,comment,63172,63892,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"You're making a lot of sense; I'm just saying, my experience was that it was harder to hire in the Bay Area than it has been for me to hire in NYC or Chicago, where I hire now. <p>It's also obvious that developers are more expensive to hire anybody in San Francisco than in Des Moines or Minneapolis.<p>Also, please note the bias towards founders in these discussions. A tiny team of founders is a good start, but you eventually need actual employees.",1191645809

63938,comment,63857,63921,0,0,queensnake,,,"I have to say, I'm inspired by pg's whole idea that the ultimate test of what you bring to society is what you can think up and build, and that barriers to your doing just exactly that, have fallen much lower. I'm still freakin' abuzz over that, together with the fact that there will probably soon be YC imitators, and that YC itself will expand, to make that a reality. Currently I'm contemplating 'which job to do, which would stall my career the least' (I do need one for the short term), but in the medium term even, it may be possible to work on exciting, possibility-busting ideas. Being that life is short, I can't get over the possibility that this'll be the new modus operandi.<p>This would be at the level of what the early internet hippies promised, way back in the beginning :)",1191644734

63935,comment,63857,63857,0,0,karzeem,,,"For hiring in the U.S., discrimination is legal if it's done on the basis of what are called ""bona fide occupational qualifications"".  This is the legal principle that allows, say, police departments to reject people who don't meet physical standards, or modeling agencies to reject people just because they're ugly.<p>You could make a good case that success on puzzle questions has a decent correlation with success as a programmer--that is, the ability to solve puzzles is probably a BFOQ for programmers, so it's safe from a legal standpoint.",1191643629

It has nothing to do with it being ""the most sane option"", or the ""first years being the most magical"". If it were that simple, the men would be lining up to quit their jobs for a few years of magic and then come back, no harm done.<p>In reality, the men are not keen on staying at home, and for good reason - you lose your marketability, and poetic ideas of parenthood aside, it's not all that magical to take care of a screaming, pooping kid who is too young to engage in activities that adults find interesting.<p>If am probably coming across a little harsh but having grown up female in the Eastern Block, I am predictably annoyed that the men from my part of the world are quick to preach to women what they don't want to practice themselves. If you think staying at home is so great, why do you immediately say David's wife should do it?",1215320364
237603,comment,236808,237591,0,0,sealedidentity,,,"OK, as per your theory of conformism, smart people want to be accepted as smart by other smart people. That is why they are atheist in the current times. The fallacy of this argument is so transparent in that smart people are generally considered non-conformist. That is the essence of geekiness if one can put it that way.<p>That there is god is for the theist to prove and not the atheist to disprove. What anyone who is rational chooses to believe is the sum total of his knowledge and his experience. You have lumped smart people as characterless by calling them conformist. So either you are a charlatan theist trying to get in a word sideways or someone who is truly and hopelessly wrong.",1215320299

So why should he be recognized as some ""expert""?</i><p>To paraphrase Dawkins' speech to the University of Kentucky,<p><i>The thing about being an atheist is that you don't think that ""theology"" is a subject at all.</i>  You're not an expert in fairies, but I'll bet you have no problem not believing in those.<p>Actually, since Dawkins is an expert in Ethology, the evolution of animal behavior, he is in fact uniquely qualified to talk about religion, as that is among the most odd, fascinating, paradoxical, and complex behaviors that evolution has yet produced.  In The God Delusion, he outlines many of the factors of the human animal that make us particularly susceptible to religion.<p>Theologists are the ones not qualified to analyze religion.",1215319444

237591,comment,236808,236830,0,0,rkts,,,"Isaac Newton was highly religious and he was smarter than any Digg user.  In fact, most smart people in Newton's time were religious.  Atheism in those days was associated with poor uneducated people, the same way racism is today.  Doesn't that disprove the hypothesis that intelligence causes people to be atheist?<p>Wait, I know what you're going to say to that.  You're going to say that Newton et al. don't count because they lived before Darwin.  The theory of natural selection, you say, was the first non-religious explanation of life that smart people could believe.  Before that, everyone just defaulted to religion because there was no better theory available.<p>It's a nice idea, but I don't buy it.  When I became an atheist as a teenager, I wasn't thinking about evolution; I didn't even have the foggiest understanding of Darwin's theories.  I've encountered many other atheists who don't.  Obviously, evolution is not usually what causes people to reject religion.<p>I think the real difference is that, in Newton's time, it was fashionable for smart people to be religious, whereas in our time it's fashionable for smart people to be atheist.  Evolution was just the fashion's tipping point.<p>Specifically, Darwin caused a few very smart people to change their minds about religion, and the greater bulk of somewhat smart people (who desperately wanted to seem like very smart people) followed suit.  Now anyone who wants to be considered smart will reject religion out of conformance.<p>Basically, people will believe anything as long as their being wrong has no noticeable impact on their lives.  Intelligence has little to do with it.  And the moral of this story is not that you are all conformist sheep, but that it doesn't matter.  If Isaac Newton struck out on the big questions, then you probably will too.  Just stop trying to answer impossible questions, and go live your life.",1215319043

So, what exists on a <i>non-material</i> level?<p>The existence of information implies that it has some representation in some medium.  Scramble the representation, and the information is gone. Qv, the files on my hard drive that time I used a magnetized screwdriver to put it in a new case, or the speaking ability of old alcoholics.<p>Pretty smart people sometimes get confused by different levels of analysis and then start saying absurd things.  We can talk about semiconductors or registers or instructions or lines of code or functions or programs.  It's not that each one of these conversations are the same, but they do imply one another.  When we talk about an abstraction like ""purple"" or ""justice"" or ""motherly"", we're implying all the real world examples (past, present, and future) of these abstractions, and focusing on what they have in common.<p>""Justice"" doesn't exist apart from just things, any more than ""purple"" exists apart from the typical human experience of purple light.  There's no sense in looking for Plato's Ideal Forms; you won't find them, no matter how many caves you turn around in.<p>I would argue that, when we talk about ""nature"", we are referring to all that exists, but that's not enough to know how to use the term, which is why you find that flip definition unsatisfactory.  We're specifically <i>focusing on</i> the level of analysis that involves fundamental properties of things.  Since things are the sum of their properties (in other words, ""things are what they are""), ""nature"" is what is, ""natural"" properly means ""consistent with a thing's fundamental properties"", and ""supernatural"" is ""imaginary and not real.""<p>God isn't natural, therefor, God doesn't exist. Quid erat demonstratum.<p>And that's why geeks are atheists ;)<p>In all seriousness, I actually think that this is what people usually mean when they use the terms ""nature"" and ""supernatural"".  They sometimes bundle in the assumption that supernatural things can exist (which is a contradiction) and that humans are somehow magical non-animal creatures and not a part of nature (which is silly.)<p><i>But that's an assumption that, right or wrong, not everyone makes, so it isn't correct to say that.</i><p>If the assumption is right, then the people who don't make it are incorrect, aren't they?  They might mean something vague and undefined when they say nature (in fact, I'm quite sure most do), but that doesn't mean that the soup of contradictions most people carry around in their heads is even slightly valid or worth worrying about.",1215319037

That's how it works.<p>If you want to read a site where ""we've already discussed that, so you can't publish it again"" is a valid criticism, you need to switch to reading scientific journals. I don't think that the alternative -- trying to turn news.yc into a site that behaves like a scientific journal -- is going to fly. We don't have a required curriculum that prospective upmodders must read. We don't make them pass an entrance exam. They're allowed to just turn up and vote. That's how this system works.<p>On this and other sites, I've always craved a moderation system whereby I could nominate a certain collection of modders whose votes I trust above others. For example, if I could click a button and see what news.yc would look like if only the YC class of 2007 were allowed to vote, I might be able to filter out the articles which were of interest only to freshmen in CS. Unfortunately, I've never really seen such a thing. Obviously, allowing an arbitrary set of such queries would risk creating a huge scaling problem, but you'd think that a site could offer a choice of two or three ways to weight the moderations. You could divide the incoming readers into ""cohorts"" based on year of arrival (or even other demographic information) and offer options for reading social news within your own cohort.",1215316924

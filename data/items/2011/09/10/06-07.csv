The guy I was replying to is by definition an HNer, and was talking about buying an air over a sony SB due to reinstall concerns. My ""how odd"" was in reply / directly to him.<p>2. Macs aren't ready to use out of the box. No computer is. You need to, at the very least, install all the apps you use and copy over your data. This takes considerable time. Did it come with Chrome? Did it come with Office? Did it come with (your editor of choice)? Did it come with Little Snitch? 1password? The caps-lock key switched to a control key? Inconsolata installed? No. And that's not a complete list by a long shot. Adding an hour long reinstall to this list isn't a big deal.<p>3. The x220 and Macbook air do have the same form factor from a functional perspective. They both are quite easy to keep with you at all times, hence both inhabiting the thin and light category used by most review sites. Yes the air is thinner, but it gives up being able to accept good hard drives to do so... making the x220 the smallest you can go and still get good performance.<p>4.

Fine, have fun - it's very much like rooting for a football team.<p>But seeing Mac users trying to ""cross swords"" in a feature/function battle is simply ridiculous. Try this on your notebook: write a sentence, go and change the 3rd word in it. Time yourself. Divide that by 5 (to get my time) multiply the difference by 1923 (that's how much we do this while coding), add a few minutes on top to compensate for missed ""Esc"" and ""Enter"" hits and then throw your arms up, scream in pain and anger, and be enlightened.

Does that further the discussion? No, nobody changes their mind. They just cherry pick other data that confirm their views, and question the neutrality of any data that doesn't.<p>I think most time people change their views on politics, it's by reading books, having life experience and thinking. Rarely by being convinced by someone on a forum.<p>Compare to discussions on other topics: in every HN thread about Javascript or systems security or nutrition or music theory, there's bound to be quite a few readers who actually learn something or even change their minds about some preconceived idea they had.<p>(now I'll stop rambling cause there's an earthquake here)",1315634487

2980968,comment,2979405,2979775,1,0,kb101,,,"""Technological progress should cause increasing economic inequality"" is a bold statement.  Presumably, increasing productivity <i>for everyone</i> is one of the signal benefits of technological progress.  If we accept that as true, then why can we not say that technological progress is agnostic as far as economic inequality is concerned?<p>Many of the arguments about economic inequality in this thread seem to be predicated on the notion that we are talking about comparing salaries or car brands.  Don't be jealous of your neighbor for having a higher salary or a better car, and why should he have to give up more of his money via taxes just to enhance your lifestyle... seems to be the gist.<p>But income inequality is rooted in the question not of does your neighbor have more goodies, but how do we divide the spoils of our shared enterprise.  If you and your neighbor are partners in the same firm, and you are working your ass off so that he can ride around in a Benz, things are a little different.<p>It is interesting to observe that when this argument is couched in terms immediately relevant to most of the posters here, the response on HN is quite different.  I.e. ""I have a great business idea, I just need someone to code it for 1% of the business equity"".  There are markedly fewer posters defending this notion, or condemning the hacker who wants a bigger share as exhibiting some kind of perverse socialist urge toward income redistribution, than there are posters in this thread defending the same notion expanded to society as a whole.",1315634439

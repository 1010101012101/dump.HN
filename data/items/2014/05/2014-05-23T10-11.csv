7788768,comment,7788162,7788387,13,0,koralatov,,,"As someone who has two cats, and has had a dog and a cat previously, I&#x27;m always amazed when I come across people who categorically state that animals <i>don&#x27;t</i> have emotions.  Spend a small amount of time with a cat or a dog, and it becomes pretty clear that they have moods and emotional states, albeit simpler ones that humans.  I realise that domestication will have changed animals and their environmental responses, but I find it very hard to believe that dogs or cats would have developed emotions from scratch in the ~10,000 years since they were domesticated.<p>In my experience, those who claim animals don&#x27;t have emotions are usually justifying some kind of behaviour;  in one case, it was a hunter, and another, someone who was generally unpleasant and cruel to animals.  The former was otherwise a nice guy, though I found his hobby extremely distasteful; the latter was an irredeemable arsehole.",1400842646
7788767,comment,7786910,7786910,1,0,rhythmvs,,,"Happy to read there is some interest in “Markdown 2.0” or “lightweight markup, next generation”. With adoption by big outlets like Github and StackOverflow, and dozens of static site generators built on plain text source files, marked-up in Markdown syntax, Markdown is becoming a _de facto_ general-purpose document _editing_ and _storage_ standard. With the advent of fast client-side parsers, soon it might even substitute html as a document _exchange format_, too (at least for some use cases).<p>But there is no official spec, development of the syntax grew stale (from the start, thanks to Gruber)¹, and hence the language heavily suffers from fragmentation²: people want to be able to do more with light-markup, so they build extensions, or fork the language altogether. The troubles with Markdown are discussed in various³ places⁴, John MacFarlane built a formalized comparison tool⁵, but as of yet, there is no joint effort to cooperate on a lightweight markup standard.<p>There are a few interesting projects that dare to forsake Markdown and try their luck: Fountain.io⁶ (a domain specific light markup language for playwriting), SkrivML⁷, Strictdown⁸, and z.m.l.⁹<p>Then there are, of course, the many predecessors of Markdown, which prove that Markdown (or light-markup in general) is not the imprescriptible privilege of its self-proclaimed benevolent dictator for life, and some of which are still widely used in various communities: Setext (1992), AFT (1999), Grutatxt (2000), AsciiDoc (2002), MediaWiki (2002), reStructuredText (2002), Org-mode (2003), Textile (2004)…<p>We need an extensible lightweight markup language of sorts, a “lxml”, if you will, and we need to work on it together.<p>If we want ever to succeed in establishing a true standard light markup language, the big challenge is not only to focus on extensibility, but also to reconcile the various existing and future syntaxes, and take care of backward-compatibility (with plain Markdown), as much as possible. As mentioned by quite a few commenters here and elsewhere, weeding out conflicting syntax should be the first thing to do.<p>For starters, I begun a concordance¹⁰, listing the various delimiters and patterns used by competing lightweight markup languages. (Very rough draft, though, and need to think about a way to formalize the data, to make more accurate comparisons, and consequently, better decisions on the syntax of a future xlml.)<p>¹ <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-future-of-markdown/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-future-of-markdown/</a>\n² <a href=""https://github.com/rhythmus/markdown-resources"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rhythmus/markdown-resources</a>\n³ <a href=""http://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2012/07/30/why-markdown-is-not-my-favourite-language/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2012/07/30/why-markdown-is-not...</a>\n⁴ <a href=""https://medium.com/the-future-of-publishing/495ccfe24a52"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/the-future-of-publishing/495ccfe24a52</a>\n⁵ <a href=""http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/faq.html#what-are-some-big-questions-that-the-markdown-spec-does-not-answer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/faq.html#what-are-some-...</a>\n⁶ <a href=""http://fountain.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fountain.io</a>\n⁷ SkrivML\n⁸ <a href=""https://github.com/jakwings/strictdown"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jakwings/strictdown</a>\n⁹ <a href=""http://www.z-m-l.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.z-m-l.com</a>\n¹⁰ <a href=""https://github.com/rhythmus/markdown-resources/blob/master/lightweightMarkupSyntaxComparison.tsv"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rhythmus/markdown-resources/blob/master/l...</a>",1400842609

7788758,comment,7787655,7787655,7,0,klunger,,,"I used to work in aerospace, specifically satellite data processing. A couple thoughts:<p>- Their core team does not have anyone with space experience. Success and knowledge from other sectors (looks like they all come from the security sector) does not translate. Space is a whole different can of worms. There are totally different and more constraining hardware requirements, regulations, cost levels to name a few.<p>They have some advisory board guys with the right experience, but they will need to be heavily involved to be useful to a team of guys coming from a security background (probably more than just as advisers).<p>- The costs associated with operating a satellite network are so stratospheric (badum-bum ding) that their claim about &quot;democratizing access to data&quot; is dubious. There is a very good reason satellite data is so damn expensive right now: it is so damn expensive to get in the first place.<p>They could lower some costs here and there maybe, but it would still be in the wrong order of magnitude. They would need to sell the data to a LOT of customers to be a profitable business, if they want to keep the cost of data low (this is what I assume they mean by &quot;democratizing access). They have provided hints of some potential applications, but have they demonstrated there is sufficient existing demand for this?<p>Probably not. So they are essentially trying to create a new market while footing astronomical up front costs themselves. That is not an attractive risk proposition.<p>I hope it works because it could be very cool (space! data!). But, I remain very skeptical.",1400842263

If you are interested in code obfuscation and a way to prove that a formally correct obfuscator is impossible, you might want to read a paper called “Can a Program Reverse-Engineer Itself?” [1] I worked on as an undergrad.<p>The idea is that a correct obfuscator should only obfuscate and not change the program&#x27;s semantics, which means that it can&#x27;t change constants that may be displayed to the users, like hardcoded integers and strings. If you use these in a Quine [2] structure to be able to retrieve your original code, then the obfuscator can&#x27;t do anything: it it breaks the Quine it is not a correct obfuscator, if it doesn&#x27;t then you can trivially get back the original code. And what is interesting here is that it is possible to take any source code and make a Quine which has it as a payload (it will do the same thing as the original source code except that it will also be a Quine), which is something we had done already for another paper [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/497"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/497</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/099"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/099</a>",1400842231

My wife keeps saying we should move to US, perhaps California. She thinks we&#x27;ll finally have some sunshine, lots of affordable fresh food, perhaps live in a house with garden, beautiful nature close enough to actually go camping for the weekends, and friendly and approachable people.

I hear stories from both ends of the spectrum.

But others claim that US is developer&#x27;s paradise. And while health insurance is expensive, some get it from their companies or it&#x27;s offset by the substantially higher salary. Some claim that public education system is also underrated.<p>What&#x27;s your opinion/experience with this?

In other words, it's reflection in the hyperplane perpendicular to the state you're looking for. Now let a = a1+...+aN, and define a new operator that reflects in the hyperplane perpendicular to a. And now put your system in state a, and repeatedly apply those two operators, one after the other.<p>The composition of two reflections is a rotation. The angle of that rotation is known (and quite small); the angle between the two vectors (your desired state and a) is close to a right angle; by doing the rotation an appropriate number of times, you bring the system's state vector close to the desired state. Now you measure the system's state, and with high probability it's the state you're looking for.<p>A little calculation shows that the number of rotations needed is roughly proportional to sqrt(N), and the probability of getting the wrong state is roughly proportional to 1/N. Now do the process as many times as it takes for 1/N^k to be small enough for your satisfaction. Congratulations: you've now found what you were looking for, taking about sqrt(N) time, with error probability as small as you like.",1246312781

679748,comment,679337,679337,0,0,tetha,,,"So. The problem is: 
Someone used an aggressive language (aggresive in the sense: The language does not defend the programmer from his own stupidness, but also does not hinder his freedom), used a certain feature of this language and fell on his face. Thus, the feature is bad. 
Uhm. I guess, in this logic, everything of C, C++, Python (at least) is bad, because you can easily fall on your face with the more efficient idioms. Certainly, you cannot iterate over the generator twice and you cannot iterate over an iterator twice (remember: a list can return multiple iterators, one at every time it is asked), but if you know a certain functions requires multiple iterations, well, pass it a list or a set or whatever is capable of generating an arbitrary amount of iterators  (or even do things like itertools.repeat(generator) :) ). The point remains: 
This is a feature of an aggressive language, and you need to know your code slightly better (meaning: more documentation, or more code immersion) in order to reach maximum efficiency. This point holds with pointers, with templates and with generators. But it also holds, that well-used pointers, well-used templates and well-used generators can speed up code magnificiently :)<p>So, overall, I don't really see the point of this article, besides someone who should go and use some defensive language.",1246312089

To be IFR certified, the receiver has to be able to tell when a satellite is giving bad data.  In the older units, this was done with RAIM, which basically compares what is coming in from all of the satellites, and determines if all of the satellites are providing positioning that is relatively consistent.  DGPS is a relatively simple system, and there's no way to check the DGPS signal for integrity.  Without the ability to check for integrity, the additional accuracy is useless, as the design of instrument approaches is based on worst-case scenarios.<p>Now newer IFR certified units do have WAAS, which is similar to DGPS, except the signal is transmitted from a satellite, and is based on measurements from a couple dozen ground stations, the correction interpolated in the unit.<p>There has been a proposal to implement a system called LAAS for a number of years, which would be like DGPS, but would have the integrity checks that are required for aviation.  However, it never really got off the ground.<p>As it stands, with WAAS, you can be guided to 200 feet above the runway, but this is not as good as the old analog radio ILS, which, if setup in a sophisticated way, can take a plane all the way to the surface.",1246311323

Let's look at the criticisms.<p>Undocumented: This one sticks, although perhaps Mel just never got around to writing documentation for the same reason he never got around to fixing the cheat bug. In any case, Real Programmers may not write many comments, but they do write external documentation, and often far more documentation than code.[1]<p>Unreliable, highly fragile: The story doesn't imply that the program was unreliable, and in fact the ending implies that the program was still working for some time after it was written, even though no one could really maintain it. Writing code that is tightly coupled to certain hardware features is not a good idea for most programmers these days who build on software APIs, usually at the top of a huge stack, and who want to be portable, but Mel didn't live in that kind of environment and wasn't aiming for portability. Even today, there are still places where code is written for known hardware and not on top of a stack of software that is going to be updated and patched and changed continually until the day it is no longer maintained (at which point, of course, it rots furiously).<p>Given the assumptions Mel was working under, he might very well have written code that lasted much longer, with zero maintenance, than most maintained code lasts. There are <i>many</i> advantages to portability and huge software stacks, but most programmers are so used to them that they have only the vaguest notions of the tradeoffs involved (it's not just performance).<p>Invalid: Ah yes, the hotshot programmer who thinks he knows better than the business people and refuses to implement perfectly good features because they go against his ""principles"", or ""aesthetic sensibilities"" wrt the code, or some such nonsense that has nothing to do with making the largest possible amount of money by doing something that Other People Want. Well, guilty as charged, but I am going to defend Mel on general principle here.<p>This part of the story resonates with some programmers because 1) like anyone else, programmers prefer to work on things that make the world a better place, or at least make themselves some money, as opposed to making scumbag upper management types 0.n% richer, especially if it is at society's expense, and 2) they hate the fact that they are seen as replaceable cogs in an IT machine that provides a messy but necessary service that any bunch of monkeys could do, and 3) if they <i>are</i> doing what any monkey could do, they are working on getting a job, or starting a company, where the technical envelope is being pushed to the point where it actually does matter how things are implemented, and where the problems are interesting enough that you <i>can't</i> grok the code just by skimming it, no matter how well it's written, because understanding it properly requires specialized knowledge that is not shared by every single programmer who's ever half-assed their way to a sheepskin, knows how to use Google, and hasn't burned out yet.<p>Encapsulation: Who says Mel didn't write well factored code? You can split things up by functionality in any language. Besides, Real Programmers write their own languages,[2] and the languages they write are designed from the ground up to provide more fine grained separation of functionality than you'll get in any managed bondage language that Melanie and all the rest of the programmers you can hire have been spending their careers becoming experts in.<p>Unit tests: Not going to say anything bad about unit tests, but they aren't a panacea or a guarantee that a program does everything it's supposed to do.<p>So, yeah. Times have changed. The standard stack is good enough for 99% of what you want to do now, as are the programmers that you can hire, and the costs of living outside of that ecosystem are high.[3] Still, there's something to be said for the other 1%, and I'll bet you there are still Mels out there kicking ass (not posting on HN), and I, for one, salute them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ultratechnology.com/forth2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ultratechnology.com/forth2.htm</a> (search for ""documentation"")<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2985/postmortem_naughty_dogs_jak_and_.php?page=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2985/postmortem_naught...</a> (scroll down to the GOAL discussion)<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2985/postmortem_naughty_dogs_jak_and_.php?page=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2985/postmortem_naught...</a> (right at the top)",1246309342

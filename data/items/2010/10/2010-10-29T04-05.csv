1846205,comment,1846019,1846176,0,0,patio11,,,"Affiliates typically work on a CPA basis: cost per action.  eBay is a little trickier, but it boils down to that.  They get paid based on conversions, not based on traffic.<p>Most people who sell via affiliates have what is called a backend.  (BCC does not.). It means, loosely speaking, any way for the company to increase LTV [edit: life time value, total economic value extracted from customer over the entirety of your relationship with them] after the initial sale, which is typically when the affiliate gets compensated.  eBay LTVs are dominated by he backend: I bought my first box of Warhammer figures for $20 and earned eBay a buck back in 2000.  Over the last ten years, I have been worth north of $2000 to eBay.<p>It is very difficult to know with certainty that the LTV of the kid buying the Warhammer figures is going to hit four figures because in a few short years he is going to move to Japan then drop off your radar for a few years then sell a hundred thousand dollars of bingo card software using his Paypal account.<p>So you need to guesstimate LTV for customers, within 30 or 60 or so days of acquisition, to pay your affiliates.  If you underpay, they send you less traffic and you lose.  You probably pay your affiliates <i>more than the instant revenue.</i>  If eBay figured my LTV was $1 and paid the affiliate 50 cents, they would have sent me to another site instead.  If Netflix paid only the first month's revenue, they'd lose signups to other sites.<p>If you overpay, you hemmorage money.<p>So you get really, really sophisticated about measuring and predicting LTV.  You understand your business better than any affiliate can hope to.  And when the numbers predict red ink?  You drop them like a bad habit.",1288328324

They point out that government is essentially monopolistic. If you have an enterprise that can force its customers to buy its goods then unless the people running the enterprise are perfect angels then the quality of its services will turn to crap over time. Contrast this with a competitive market where a consumer has lots of choice and service providers have incentive to provide the best quality at the lowest cost.

1846168,comment,1845918,1845918,0,0,jasonjei,,,"The author hits it spot on about Singapore. It would probably have more in common with Apple than IBM--efficiently run, capitalist (to an extent), but is more or less a one-party system, as is common in East Asia (with the exception of Australia).<p>Singapore is perhaps the best example of the so-called Apple 1984-ad state of information purity directives. OK, maybe that is an exaggeration. It is more likely the result of Asian/Confucian culture that views the State as an entity that must not be disagreed with. And like Apple, the standards are very controlled, and those found in violation with its policies are to be eliminated. [1] Like Apple, if you use the product--or the system, in Singapore--as intended, you'll find it very pleasant and easy to use. Try to do something not allowed, and you'll find very little tolerance for it and very little sympathy too.<p>A lot of Westerners find it bewildering that none of these people will fight for their rights and will let the state erode on their freedoms. That is because it is a result of Confucian influence that has taught them specifically to never be a thorn in the side to anyone: groupthink mentality. So you see that Singapore's codified laws have more in common with the first codes of history or UCMJ than the forgiving laws of the West. Speech is viewed as a privilege in almost all East Asian countries, and those found in abuse will be punished severely and swiftly, and if there are no laws that will allow them to do so, they will be ostracized.<p>Hong Kong is probably as close as you can get to a free economic state as far as East Asian regions go [2]. It's ironic--I know--that a Chinese region has a relatively free system. But Hong Kong's laws are some of the best in the world--based on Common law framework, right to trial by jury, freedom of speech until 2040. Private banks are authorized to print money/bank notes (HSBC, Standard Chartered, Hang Seng, Bank of China), and the government keeps taxes low (no sales tax and income capped at 15%, 10% if you're in medicine or education). There are no tariffs or excise, and the government sustains public services by hiring and paying good salaries of competent public officials. Hell, their Chief Executive wears a bow tie and his website is <a href=""http://www.CEO.gov.hk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.CEO.gov.hk</a><p>In fact, I was surprised that all phones in Hong Kong are sold unlocked because government regulations require freedom of phone service. Which is where I bought my iPhone. (And it should come as no surprise that Singapore sells them locked.)<p>A lot of people think Hong Kong has been ruined by China, but so far, it reminds me a lot of what a startup country with rights would entail; I would venture to say that it is poster child of libertarianism. It is more capitalist than the States (subway and rail systems are privatized), yet provides excellent government benefits (the government makes money by selling land at market value and hiring good salespeople to do it). There is still no death penalty in Hong Kong, and the judicial system is one of the most balanced in the world, with judges that have remained since even during British rule (you are not required to be a Hong Konger to sit as a judge). Hong Kong isn't as clean as Singapore, but it's certainly friendlier to do business. (many Western businesses will not sign agreements with Chinese companies on the Mainland because of its legal framework; China Mobile, for instance, has its corporate headquarters in Hong Kong for this reason). You can't be put in jail just because you write something the government doesn't like. And a whiff of cannabis won't kill you either.<p>Singapore is similar, except they are probably closer to the Chinese in their ideaology. A lot of people ask me what I think a free China would look like. I said possibly very similar to Singapore, and the truth is, there is a lot in common with China. Taiwan, the so-called Republic of China or ""free China,"" was a military dictatorship (complete with summary trials/executions) until 1993.<p>[1] You can see that this sustained China through 5,000 years of tyranny since Confucius was well-liked by Chinese kings since he sold brain-washing as a philosophy; that all must respect the parents, the state, and the teacher, because if you do all three, you'll respect me, the king.<p>[2] Edited for grammar and clarified that Hong Kong is the top ranking free economic system. The laws which are friendly to civil rights (including no death penalty which is still on the books in Japan, freedom of speech), fair application of the law, make it economically very free. However, 1/3 of the government is controlled by the Mainland, and the 2/3rds by corporate interests and the people. <a href=""http://asiancorrespondent.com/hong-kong-blog/freest-econonomy-rankings-2010"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asiancorrespondent.com/hong-kong-blog/freest-econonom...</a>",1288327351

We tend to classify people by their direction, ""right"" or ""left"" or ""liberal"" or ""conservative"", but it is a grave error to mistake the direction for the destination. I drive south to get to work but it is not in fact my intention to get to the South Pole every time I do so; I arrive at my destination and stop, and in fact if I pass it, I will turn around to get there. (It would be absurd in ideological terms to then call me a hypocrite for going from being a Southist to a Northist.)<p>And it's hard to get past that fundamental error to have some sort of ""discussion"". I am a libertarian right now, but the caricature in the post is so absurd I can't even take offense. Because I think an entity so utterly absurdly monstrous that its yearly budgetary overruns are measured in the trillions of dollars a year and it's unfunded liabilities measure in the hundreds of trillions should be cut down to size before it takes the entire world over a cliff, I want to see child labor laws repealed? It doesn't even make sense. There's not much to ""counter"".<p>In fact I actually consider myself a ""Classical Liberal"", which today makes you a ""conservative"" in terms of direction, but my <i>destination</i> isn't ""anarchy"". Just something much smaller, much more focused, much less resource intensive, and much less likely to crash the economy because there's every incentive to spend and no incentive to stop. (Which I actually consider the fundamental failure of liberalism, it in fact <i>has</i> become a direction and not a destination in practice. If you can identify some principle being used to decide when we have spent enough money on something, I'm all ears. And I mean a principle <i>in use by the government</i>, not some hypothetical principle that could be used by somebody, sometime.) If that's so unreasonable, well, I hope you enjoy the blasted remnants of the economy that results.<p>Part of the reason I want to see our government cut down to size is that when we crash the system, we will <i>lose</i> welfare and child labor laws and potentially civil order itself. I understand the impulse to circle the wagons and defend the government, but the simple fiscal reality is that if you really do like the results of a strong government capable of protecting its citizens, you really need to help me refocus it on those tasks or you'll be left with a government that can do <i>nothing</i>. Can you seriously imagine child labor laws being repealed in the US? I mean, seriously? This isn't even remotely a threat; economic collapse on the other hand at this point due to an overextended government is more like ""can we avoid it or is it too late already?"" Probability of a repeal of child labor laws is virtually zero; probability of a government without any ability to pay anyone to enforce them, rather greater than zero even if I am not yet panicking.",1288327140

Evidence in support of this is how some US citizens treat illegal immigrant workers who don't enjoy the protection of labour laws etc - it is laissez faire in action, right now. Another example is how US corporations treat labour in developing countries (such as China), and detainees from other countries. Whoa, that's getting political.<p>OTOH, we must remember that trade - like language, law and religion - are created spontaneously by human communities. Our current society didn't just create it; it appears to be innate. However, the specific ideas  of trade and civic structures that we have today are informed by centuries of experience and thought, and constitute a tremendous cultural refinement of the innate concept of trade.

3 hours and he's making money! What am I doing wrong?<p>Nothing. Take a look around his site. He is already an extensive expert in the field of user experience, with numerous successes under his belt. I am sure those successes were the product of a lot of education and years and years of hard work. He already has quite a following on his blog due to those successes. There was a lot that went on before he could start marketing something and sell it right off the bat.<p>Last summer I saw Michael Franti in concert. You may know him as the overnight success that had the song ""Say Hey"" if you listen to pop radio at all. (It has been in numerous TV shows, a Corona commercial, It was one of the songs played during Oprah's last show, etc.) I happen to know him as an artist who traveled from festival to festival year in and year out. Sometimes playing to a couple hundred people. Even before success, he was a world traveler, has played with indigenous people in the bush of third world countries with no electricity. He was a successful spoken word performer and has been in several bands that rose and fell long before he current lineup. I think he had released about 10 or 11 albums with various groups with virtually no mainstream success before the album that included Say Hey. At the concert I saw him at, he mentioned the press he was getting at being an overnight success and added, ""yeah, with 20 years in the making.""<p>So I guess you could say that Michael probably made hundreds of thousands of dollars for singing that 3 minute song. But there was a lot that went on in his life to get him there.",1288326795

After a few evenings of hacking, @dustball and I are pleased to present OpenKeyval.<p>OpenKeyval is a completely open key-value data store, exposed as a drop-dead simple web service. The goal is to make this a very easy way to persist data in web applications.<p>http://openkeyval.org/<p>As a data storage system, it's pretty basic: you can store any data you want under a particular key, and then fetch it later. You can also serve it back with a particular MIME type, so it can be used to serve small resources. The keyword small is operative here: the data is limited to 64 KiB, which is plenty of space for storing interesting data, but not really big enough for storing images or any other sort of media.<p>As a social experiment, I think it's sort of fun: there's no authentication of any kind -- just come up with sufficiently unique keys to make it unlikely that anyone else will stumble upon them. Scouts honour that anything you put here is safe in our hands.<p>I'm curious as to what people think this might be useful for, and if you have any feature requests. I'd love to see people try to build something with it -- but go easy on us, since it's just an experiment. :)",1288325815

Can you live with a slightly lower income for a couple of years? Are the benefits a deal-breaker? Obviously getting experience is your priority and it sounds like both will give you that (though it sounds like company 1 will give you more of the experience you are after).<p>One thing you didn't mention with the two companies is possibility for promotion.

He hasn't been to the doctor in at least 5 years even for a physical.  However, he eats the Ramen without cooking it and just putting the spices or flavoring on it and then crunching through it.  To be honest, it makes me sick watching it, so maybe that counts?",1288325706

You can obviously build a few with your existing crappy tools.  Rather than going through all the trouble and distraction of raising money, when you are not even sure if there is much of a market there - just start selling and find out!  You will soon know if this is something worth perusing, and you can use the income generated to buy better tools and scale up the business.<p>In the unlikely event that you start to become flooded with orders you can either create some kind of waiting list people can add their e-mail addresses to, or just increase your prices until you have a level of demand you can deal with.<p>To pull some advice from the software related start-up work, If you are not embarrassed by version 1, then you have waited to long to release.",1288325266

And it certainly isn't as useful for diagnostic debugging on changes to the code.<p>But it's in the user's language (-ish), so it's more likely to be funded and supported.

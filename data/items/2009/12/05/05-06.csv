Repurposing our core real-time editing technology to create something like EtherPad may be a very good idea. But turning Squad into EtherPad isn't.<p>The next direction for Squad is better project handling via a tree file browser, SFTP, version control hooks, etc. not adding formating buttons or making shares embedable. I think Squad and EtherPad were diverging like say Dreamweaver and Word. That's not to say we wouldn't like to capitalize on both the Dreamweaver and Word markets. :)<p>Here is my suggestion, I say you (or someone else passionate about this) go over to <a href=""http://sproutbox.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sproutbox.com/apply</a> and fill out an app for recreating something like EtherPad. If you're selected, you'd be working with the same team that built Squad. We'd donate a big chunk of real-time editing code and you'd have something up around the time EtherPad shuts down. Win Win.<p>But hurry, apps close tomorrow at 11:59pm.",1259992242

977786,comment,977526,977772,0,0,evgen,,,"I have only a limited understanding of the details of BACON, but from what I remember it was what is called a ""production system"" and somewhat akin to an evolving expert system.  Something like BACON starts out with a set of rules and then tweaks them looking for patterns that can be generalized into new rules.  Novel for the early 80s, but in practice these systems seemed to be limited to very specific domains.<p>Eureqa is a genetic programming system (running over a graph encoding, bonus points for that one :) that evolves a set of rules from basic components to fit a set of data and hopefully be able to make future predictions.  The general concept is not really new -- some of Koza's early examples of the power of GP were evolving Kepler's third law using astronomical data points as the input and evolving Ohm's law in a similar fashion[1] -- but developing a general toolkit and packaging it as a useful tool is somewhat novel.  One thing that probably distinguishes Eureqa is that I would expect the output to be more parsimonious than that developed by a production system like BACON. A system like BACON is also more complex, involving various layers of detectors and rule emitters, while a GP system can be very simple once you have figured out the best set of operators for a problem domain.<p>[1] It should be noted that BACON did these tasks as well, so they are more of a general rule-building yardstick and put GP at a similar level to the well-developed (and well-funded) production systems research of the era.",1259990695

The first version of my site was an awful lot like Baby's First Bookstore, Rails 2007 Edition.  It has gradually accumulated more features and sophistication as I've grown as a web programmer.<p>A lot of the complexity in Rails is hidden until you need it.  If you don't understand Rails caching yet, that's no problem, you <i>don't have to understand it</i> until you actually have to use it.

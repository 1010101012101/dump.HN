2855224,comment,2851470,2851797,6,0,ldar15,,,"Technology does not kill jobs: instead it allows the new jobs to be created <i>elsewhere</i>.<p>50,000 BC: your ""job"" (finding food) so dominated your life that your entire community followed it around.<p>20,000 BC: farming began. Your ""job"" is in the field by your house.<p>1700 AD: agricultural revolution. Technology allows smaller number to produce food.  This allows industrial revolution. More specifically, this creates surplus food which means people can <i>move</i>. And so jobs can move. But it also means that areas that cannot produce food competitively no longer have to. Surplus food allows jobs to move to where the water wheels and resources are to commence industrialization.<p>1800 AD: The invention of the steam engine frees jobs from the need to be near flowing water: i.e. to move to where the resources are, or where the need to be. For much of the UK this was near ports as raw materials (e.g. cotton) came by ship. Bonus if the port is near a coal field. Again, areas that do not have cheap access to transport and coal, no longer have jobs.<p>1970 AD: Oil, giant ships, containerization and ""free"" trade allows jobs to move where wages are cheaper. Entire <i>nations</i> are uncompetitive at manufacturing.<p>2005 AD: Communications revolution. International calls are free. Service industry jobs move to where wages are cheaper. Entire <i>nations</i> are uncompetitive for service industry.<p>2008 AD: Computer Vision revolution: computers can now do picking and sorting that previously required a human.<p>201X AD: Robot Dexterity revolution: computers can now do fine motor skills, such as stitching shoes. Nike finally stops using child labor.<p>What is left for humans?<p><i>Technology has been killing (but not net killing) jobs for centuries.</i><p>Is this true? Or is it the case that as technology kills jobs, the unemployed find make work? That is, even if the unemployment level in a country has stayed the same, does it mean that the new jobs that the displaced workers perform are useful, or just a drain on society? Sure in the 19th century there were new non-make-work jobs. But today? Example: people working at Hallmark stores. Example: layer upon layer of middle and upper management. Perhaps it doesn't matter: if society can support make-work jobs, because of efficiencies elsewhere, then as long as people are employed it doesn't matter how. The problem would be if those make-work jobs could no longer be supported. This is what is happening: it is not in China's interest any more to support the vast inefficiencies of the US economic system. Make-work jobs are going away.<p>Finally, WWII: we destroyed most of the world economy to the point where the US <i>was</i> the world economy (ok, 75% of it). Does this have anything to do with the US having full employment (i.e. hiding technology's job kill) - and if so, now that the rest of the world has caught up, might we now see that the US economy cant support the make-work jobs?",1312675081

2855218,comment,2853652,2854047,16,0,Goladus,,,"> Humans are visual animals, GUI's are a result of our evolutionary history.<p>Your example isn't really why GUIs are good.  Yes, humans are great at navigating a GUI, however all four of those problems are introduced by the GUI to begin with.  On a command line, you don't have to scan 1.3 million pixels.  You learned where to look the first time you ever used it.  You don't have to ignore anything, except maybe your scrollback buffer.  You don't have to find any buttons.  You don't have to identify a symbolic representation of the task at hand.  You do have to know what you're doing, which I'll address later.<p>And those tasks are NOT done effortlessly.  We may pretend it is, but frankly I have a huge problem with the clutter of my GUI.  My brain gets tired, often without my realizing it, filtering out all the extraneous crap on my screen.  I'm so much more productive with all that out of the way.  I've taken to using compiz zoom to clear out all my tabs and taskbars and menus and of course ads and stuff so I can actually focus on the articles I'm reading.<p>But yes, you do have to know ahead of time how to do what you want to do.  There is no representation to guide you, symbolic or otherwise, unless you know how to look for it.  What the GUI actually does is the last sentence of your post:  GUIs convey information.  GUIs let people learn to use something as they go.  Without a GUI, there is usually more of an up-front investment into learning how to use a tool.  That people are good at navigating GUIs is incidental.  People are good at using mechanical devices and language, too.<p>And as someone who has spent a significant amount of time helping people use windows applications, often the GUI doesn't even matter.  They still have to get help to accomplish simple things, and often wind up completely misunderstanding what the GUI is trying to tell them.<p>> However, teaching the average person to use a new piece of software is near impossible without utilizing their incredible brain power for visual recognition.<p>It's not impossible.  20 years ago, before ""UX designer"" was even a word, plenty of average, non-technical employees used text-based and command-line systems to get work done.  Students at my university had no problem using PINE on OpenVMS to read their email.  People have the ability to learn command language and program motor memory.  It's not even close to impossible.<p>But learning a formal language rather than a graphical interface is just sufficiently harder that having an easier-to-use GUI gives software vendors a <i>competitive advantage</i>.  So in the last 20 years have GUIs have evolved a great deal, and are used even when they don't fully expose the power of the software they're providing, or fail to provide the user all the knowledge necessary to use the software effectively.",1312674811

My finance buddies in IB/PE like to say that finance is the only portion of econ that actually works. The braindead portion = econ minus finance, is only good for academia, a shot at the Nobel and a job at the treasury :)<p>I actually think econ is a huge distraction net-net, because of the compelling number of contradictory narratives that cannot obviously all be simultaneously true. In that event, the only objective function is the asset price. In that sense, its important to latch on to asset prices and functions of those prices, understand how the slopes of those functions change, and then understand how the vector sum changes if you take a bunch of those products in tandem. Personally, I've been able to protect my portfolio only by not getting distracted by the underlying economic explanations( assuming those are even valid, given the dubious nature of the source ie. right-wing economist vs left-wing vs freshwater economist vs saltwater vs libertarian vs pseudo-socialist vs social-democratic vs conservative vs religious-conservative vs fiscal-conservative vs 100 other flavors ) and just focus on market    indices that matter and derivatives that hedge those indices in case things go south.<p>I will go out on a limb and claim that if you spend $100 subscribing to 4 trading forums/chatrooms ( whether day-trading or swing-trading or commodities or derivatives or fx ), you are saving yourself a lot of grief than if you spend the same $100 buying econ publications. Atleast the former opinions can be validated by simply buying/selling whatever asset they advocate ( not necessarily with real $, just paper-trade ). The latter cannot be validated at all. I remember attending a lecture where the reputed economist says unemployed people must be taxed at a higher rate because they are consuming oxygen but not paying revenue towards the GDP! That is actually very sound economics from some bizzaro school of thought ( <a href=""http://healthcare-economist.com/tag/oxygen-tax/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://healthcare-economist.com/tag/oxygen-tax/</a> ) taken to its logical conclusion! Rather than think about this dismally depressing scenario, tell me the price of such oxygen contracts and I'll see if the market is sufficiently liquid so I can take a position in those contracts :)",1312674227

And why shouldn't they?  My experience as an interviewer has been that such great things as ""decades of industry experience designing and implementing very complex systems"", or a Ph.D, or a 4.0 GPA from a top school are only very loosely correlated with whether or not a candidate can code his way out of a paper bag.  As such, it is reasonable to think that there is a profit to be made filtering out the >80% of candidates who cannot code their way out of paper bags.<p>I've never been particularly desperate or unemployed (though I did not have a job while I was in university), and I think that the few minutes necessary to solve any of these problems is a reasonable use of time if it can signal a potential employer that you are more likely to be competent than a huge majority of their applicants.

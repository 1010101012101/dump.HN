4989239,comment,4989113,4989113,6,0,shortformblog,,,"It's a nice concept (and the fact that you have ads off to the side is great because too few sites of this nature worry about business model), and I appreciate the focus on credit, but I guess my question is this:<p>Clearly the site that this reminds people the most of is Tumblr (I also see shades of imgur and 9gag in this), and Tumblr has some distinct advantages in that it allows you to create a site around the stuff you curate, and also has a few other options. But  and here's something key  you can customize the experience as much or as little as you want.<p>Does this design focus too much on the centralized angle of the site as a whole and too little on the end user? It seems like the design of this site doesn't offer much in the way of customization and doesn't seem focused on letting end users make the content ""theirs"" as much as the collective whole. This is reinforced by the fact that you discourage repeat posts  a key difference between this and Tumblr, where they have a reblog button essentially <i>designed</i> to allow repeat posts. While that kind of approach makes sense for an individual blog, if you're looking to build this out as a wider content-curation tool, you should focus on the end user pages.<p>Now, this approach doesn't need to look like Tumblr. Look at what RebelMouse does. While it's somewhat Pinterest-y, it has a few key differences, such as the ability to customize HTML and embed on user websites.<p>I guess that, if you sold this as an alternative to imgur that can do a couple of extra things for Reddit users that imgur can't, that would be an angle. But I think the reason why people use curation tools is that they're trying to curate for themselves and not the site itself.<p>Let me know what you think.",1356960637

I'm not sure if OEMs have included it in actual products, but why would they have? I might be wrong. There are separate installers available to get Busybox on a rooted Android device.\n<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busy...</a><p>They have a version of the Ash shell, Berkeley licensed, with the original notice by Kenneth Almquist. The Busybox Ash is also derived from the same origin.<p>As others have pointed out, they also have their own libc.<p>Most of these decisions seem to have been made to avoid using the GPL outside of the kernel. And a custom libc seems to entail that patches have been necessary to enable some of the standard GNU based tools they <i>do</i> have. If I understand correctly, mainly because of Bionic, you often can't just take a standard piece of Linux userland software and make it work without modifications or without including the GNU libc.<p>Also because of avoiding the GPL, the hardware driver model is different, with most of the driver logic being in closed source userland code.<p>The filesystem layout is non-POSIX-like, the way the user accounts and processes are handled is non-standard, they have their own dynamic linker, etc. Not to mention that a large part of the system relies on their Dalvik (Java) virtual machine, with a large application framework implemented in C++ and Java through JNI.<p>I'm not familiar with the embedded Linux landscape, so I don't know if this heavy avoidance of the GPL is common there. But I do know Android does not resemble GNU/Linux for these reasons.",1356959668

It also lagged in adoption of text messaging and so on. This is presumably due to the weird regulations that the very powerful telecoms companies managed to place themselves under, which stifle competition. The US never led here. In Japan, for example, gigabit to the home has been available reasonably cost effectively for almost a decade.<p>In terms of apps, there is much freer competition. I think the biggest difference here is that in the Bay Area there is a very high proportion of iPhone users, whereas in the rest of the world Blackberry, Nokia and Android dominate.

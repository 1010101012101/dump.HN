7581290,comment,7580722,7580722,2,0,pcurve,,,"I think we all know that this type of article indicting designers for lack of creativity isn&#x27;t something new.  But I certainly can related to the author&#x27;s sentiment and here&#x27;s my take on it; the number of good web designers with proper design training only accounts for a small percentage of the people producing web sites.<p>Despite web design being a visual medium, not everybody working in the industry is a visual web designer.  There are print designers struggling to make transition, there are developers doing designs out of necessity, and there are people who are learning everything from scratch.  And the nature of the Web makes it&#x27;s easy to lift and &#x27;borrow&#x27; things from other people, so you will see a lot of convincingly good designs that are not necessarily produced by designers with design training.<p>Most web work can be copied with basic use of Photoshop, access to stock photos and portfolio sites, and some attention to details.  But there is only so much you can do when you don&#x27;t know how to draw, use and mix colors, lay-out types.  This will contribute to sites looking the same.  A trained designer has much bigger set of tools and skill-set at his or her disposal.  Simply knowing how to draw well, opens up all sorts of creative possibility, but it&#x27;s a skill that takes a long time to develop.<p>So in a nutshell, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that designers have completely given up dreaming.  It&#x27;s just become harder to find great designer&#x27;s work because the denominator of non-designers has grown so large.<p>There are other contributing factors, such as increasing number of stakeholders now driving designs in the name of semantic design, usability, accessibility, codeability and maintainability, but I&#x27;m sure others will touch on those issues.",1397396846

It sounds like the code he shared was utility code, i.e. typically the kind of thing that would be fine to share if it were allowed since it doesn&#x27;t undermine the companies position.<p>He was stupid.  He should have made his intentions clear from the start, and he might well have simply gotten permission.  As is, what he stole may well have been more akin to a using company laptop solely for personal use - certainly some kind of fraud, but probably also the kind of activity that the company might well have condoned if he&#x27;d only have asked.<p>Of course, without knowing what that code was and to what extent it was written on company dime, it&#x27;s hard to say whether this was more like a bureaucratic oversight, a minor but intentional infraction, or a serious bit of fraud.<p>Regardless, it definitely sounds like Goldman really abused this guy.  Keeping people in the dark about their true worth as negotiating strategy, and encouraging single-person whatever-works-goes work ethics (which may well be a form of intentional plausible deniability given the firms history) sounds to me like they treat their employees like exploitable resources.<p>So sure, I&#x27;d hope everyone would think twice before accepting a job offer there - because they clearly will stab you in the back when it serves them to do so.<p>In other words",1397396083

It may appear weird, but indulge me. I have seen this happen over and over.<p>- Say employees are paid X amount a month. Now, with their current method, they can be slimey and not deliver, and then tell the boss it&#x27;s complicated, Photoshop, etc.. So it&#x27;s just few cards to deliver per day.<p>Maybe they have their macros, etc, to speed stuff up (not to the point of your software), but they only speed things up when they need to, and they slow them when they need a break. A card can take up an eternity, just because it&#x27;s easier to do work on the same thing for 6 hours: You don&#x27;t think much. Start the second thing for 2 hours and go home.<p>So a software that speeds this whole thing risks taking control out of these employees, because there would be a clear metric, a clear number of cards to expect.<p>It doesn&#x27;t &quot;depend&quot; on anything anymore. They can&#x27;t hustle their way around it.<p>Second problem is that, these employees make X amount a month, producing y cards.. With your software, they would <i>still</i> make that amount with 10y cards, so they have nothing to gain, really.<p>Sure, they&#x27;re making more cards but &quot;what&#x27;s in it for me&quot;.<p>There is one, additional tricky part: The boss doesn&#x27;t want it, and why..<p>The boss is paying the employee X dollars/month and the employee produces, say 10 cards/day to fill a 30 cards/day order from their clients.<p>With your software, the employee produces the whole 30 cards/day, and then what ? Sits there all day ?<p><i>Even</i> for the boss, an order can wait 3 days to fill. No problem. The employee is there, he&#x27;s being paid anyway, so whether it takes 1 day or 3 days is irrelevant.<p>The reason they&#x27;re not interested is that they don&#x27;t ship that many cards anyway, so the benefit of having your software is only marginal.<p>But maybe you can do the following.. Make your own company and gut them.<p>Or if you don&#x27;t want to, and you&#x27;re willing to force yourself upon them, you can contact their clients and ask them if they had something against your software (which ?)..<p>The software that makes a gazillion cards per day your contractor doesn&#x27;t want to buy/licence, making you wait to get your cards..",1397395587

If so, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how that effects the slow motion pogrom that includes this incident....<p>Ignoring all that, if you were successful, you&#x27;d be in for quite a surprise when the police arrested <i>you</i> instead of the innocent you assaulted, and it sure sounds like &quot;extreme force&quot; would result in your being convicted of felony battery or whatever that crime is named in your jurisdiction.  Hmmm, after such a display, once you got out of prison, you might find yourself barred from any contact from your kids; you would certainly not be setting a good example for them.<p>Side note: California <i>case law</i> (!!!) has the strongest &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; provision I&#x27;ve ever heard of, extending to allowing you to, &quot;<i>if reasonably necessary, to pursue an assailant until the danger of bodily injure has passed.

Like, in latin languages you write 2 letters and you have the difference between open and closed vowels. Certain rules then dictate when you have 2 open vowels after one another, you&#x27;re supposed to introduce a word boundary, and abrupt fall-of of the first vowel immediately followed by the second, also long (fun thing is that, of course the rules started changing. So in latin ae the a and e are short vowels, like &#x27;ai&#x27;, but in English you&#x27;d say &#x27;a-e&#x27;), which is sort-of the same in latin. It&#x27;s just in latin you write the vowel before and after the split, in semitic languages you write that there is a split. These letters make the difference between, say, kaba and ka-aba. Or agan and haganah (&#x27;haganaa&#x27;). But you&#x27;d still use the same letters for keaba, kuoba, and other words (if they existed).",1397394195

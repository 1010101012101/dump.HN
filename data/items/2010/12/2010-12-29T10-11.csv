If you are just a run off the mill dentist that takes care of mouth hygiene, then there is little incentive to make better website since you can probably better off doing local neighborhood direct marketing.<p>However if you are offering Cosmetic Dentistry, each new client can worth thousands of dollars and people will travel from their immediate surrounding to go reach your dentist practice.",1293620308

2048452,comment,2047058,2047058,0,0,srean,,,"A few odd couple short of 20 years ago, but nevertheless, Linux was a new wonder to me. Red Hat CDs came packaged with issues of a computer magazine. This was in India. 7 KB/sec was fast, and it lasted a burst or two per day. Was absolutely new to programing. Wrote a p2p service for sharing rpm packages, because downloading them from upstream was so slow. Wrote it in TCL, it went nowhere. But a few snippets of that code found its way into the tcl library.<p>Laser printers were a frightfully expensive piece of equipment and wasting toner bothered me. So went through ghostscript code to realize for the first time how beautiful code can truly be. Patched a part of the driver to handle economy mode.<p>Had it not been for FSF and open-source, I would perhaps have never learned programming. I did not major in CS, but for those who did, without FSF it would have been unaffordable.",1293620090

Yeah not only do they flicker (which is bad for your eyes, even though it is not fast enough that you can see them just like the old CRT monitors) and there is some evidence that they may be linked to eye cancer, but even if they aren't they take about 30 seconds to turn on fully, which means I have to walk the corridor in the dark (what then is the purpose of lightning? fuck if I know).

He doesn't take personally because it's not ONE article to HIM.<p>Sometimes I email the whole team, sometimes two or three people, sometimes just him. Sometimes I want him to learn something, but instead I ask on my email, based on his extensive experience in general areas of life and stuff, what he thinks about the article. Sometimes I say ""hey boss I've been reading articles about management tonight here's a dump of them"", sometimes I say ""hey boss remember last week when we mentioned X, well here's more, what do you think?"".<p>Actually that's a pretty good strategy, asking ""what do you think, please share your wisdom and enlighten me"", or ""a friend passed me this article saying it's good but I'm not sure yet, what do you think"". You get the idea. This is good because the boss likes to be seen as a reference, a bastion of smartness, but it's bad because he might see you as someone who doesn't know stuff, and worse, someone who constantly admits that (some realpolitikal companies don't like this behaviour).<p>Anyway, just always send stuff.",1293619054

As far as I understand this, you can't explain the structure of the Ulam spiral in a trivial way. You are correct that there is a trivial part to the spiral: diagonal lines alternate between odd and even numbers, therefore all the primes lie along diagonal lines. However, the structure is much richer than that.<p>The question is why certain lines have lots of primes and not others? why is a given polynomial so rich in primes, while other similar ones are not?
That's what some of these conjectures are trying to prove.",1293618583

I talked to my doctor about it and he now has me on adderall instead, and the only side effect I experience now is loss of appetite - and I'm overweight anyway.<p>I'd like to mention that people should be very careful about seeking treatment with psychoactive drugs.

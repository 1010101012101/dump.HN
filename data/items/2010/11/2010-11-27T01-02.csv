What will they be doing all day to earn half or more of the profits of the company?<p>Or do your friends have money, but no knowledge of the industry they intend to start a company in, no network, and no sales skills?<p>Or do they suck at sales, have no network and no money, but really know the industry?  Who's going to pay for servers, the engineer who is also giving up thousands and thousands of dollars in opportunity costs?  Who's going to get them in the door to do their terrible sales pitch to potential customers?<p>Non-technical business people have to be ready to hit the ground running just as hard as the technical people.  Having amazing business people really is half of a successful technology company.  As a result, having shitty business people basically ruins your chances.<p>Finally, to address your point, how do you think you get a meeting with VCs?  You just show up at their door and they cut you a check?  Either you have an in with them through your network, or you have to sell them on your idea.  But you say your friends only have one of (money, network, knowledge, sales skills).  So, if they have the network they can get in the door, but not get any VC money, or if they have sales skills they can get the deal but can't get in the door.  However you slice it up, it's fail.<p>No, I don't think this conflicts at all with the HN vibe.  HN is HackerNews.  Paul Graham was writing books on Common-Lisp well before he got into the entrepreneurship game.  If anything, HN is about giving awesome technical people the skills they need in business, not hand holding wanna-be entrepreneurs who can't contribute (not that all business people fall into that category at all, but I'd wager all the ones who are trolling the internet to find people to do work on their 'great idea' do fall into it).",1290823169

1944023,comment,1942154,1943228,0,0,icegreentea,,,"Not exactly an expert on heraldry, but I'm fairly fascinated by it.<p>The British Royal Coat of Arms, which is the say the coat of arms of the Royal family does not have anything equivalent to olive branch. Rather, it's a coat of arms to depict the 'linage' of the United Kingdom. The triple lion represents England and is form Richard the Lionheart's Coat of Arms, the single lion represents the Scottish crown, and then harp Ireland.<p>Remember, coat of arms were originally meant to be more or less unique identifiers for armored noble men. The British (and many other European coat of arms) are direct results of centuries of Royal Families merging, changing, redesigning their heraldry. Their message/symbolism can be 'constructed' as much as history allowed them to be. The Great Seal (and coat of arms) of the United States was designed. A few people sat around and decided what to put on it and what it would represent. The closest to that happening in 'old Europe' would be the royalty trying to figure out which third cousin (only half joking) to marry, or what land to invade and exactly which method to use to join the coat of arms.<p>Seriously, I think that in heraldry is interesting stuff. An attempt at a system that codifies a which relationship between visual and written display. In case you never knew, every piece of heraldry has a written description that describes the piece of heraldry 'precisely'. That is to say that if you follow the rules, then any drawing that satisfies ""Or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules"" (Scotland) -is- the Scottish coat of arms (in theory anyways). For example ""Or a lion rampant"" means golden lion in the rampant position. Doesn't matter how you draw the lion, as long as its recognizable as a lion.",1290822958

While many claimed discrimination, what it turned out to be a slew of different issues. Except from his lecture, taken without permission:<p>Why Are Female Faculty Members Underrepresented at Research
Universities Relative to Liberal Arts Colleges
1. Gender differences in preferences for teaching vs. research
2. Perceptions by female PhDs that research universities are not hospitable environments for them
3. Perceptions by female PhDs that there is more gender discrimination
against female faculty at research universities
4. Actual gender discrimination against female PhDs in the hiring process and against female faculty in salary, tenure, promotion and resource allocation decisions at research universities
5. The difficulty of combining family and career at research universities<p>The remainder of my discussion is going to focus on the last explanation and discuss some policies designed to reduce these difficulties that have been implemented at the University of California. However, before doing so, I want to stress that issues relating to the conflict between family and career that professional women face are not unique to academia. For example,
1. Why are female lawyers underrepresented among the partners of large law firms?
2. Why are female doctors underrepresented among neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons and overrepresented among family practice physicians and pediatricians?<p>National Research Council Committee (that I served on) Survey
In 2004-2005 the National Research Council Committee on Gender Differences in the Careers of Science, Engineering and Mathematics<p>Faculty surveyed departments in research universities in six disciplines
– biology, chemistry, civil engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, and physics. A second survey surveyed over 1,800 faculty in these departments. Among its major findings were:
1. If a male and a female apply for the a position, the female is more likely to be invited for an interview
2. If a male and female are both interviewed for a position, the female is more likely to receive the job offer. Hence
3. Female under representation relative to their share of the new PhD pool is due primarily to their not applying for jobs at research universities as often as males do. Furthermore
4. Female assistant professors in these fields are more likely to leave their positions than their male colleagues prior to being considered for tenure. Given that they are considered for tenure, they are more likely to be promoted and receive tenure than their male colleagues, but their
average time until receiving tenure is longer than their male colleagues’ average time
5. There were no differences in the probabilities of being promoted to full professor or the time it took to receive this promotion.

  people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have
  the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and
  you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don't know
  quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort
  of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of
  interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and
  what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence
  because you might say, ``The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.'' I don't
  know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work
  with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although
  people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work
  on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.

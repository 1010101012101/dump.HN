131233,comment,131131,131131,0,0,fiaz,,,"I think this is a brilliant business move.  It keeps the overall experience of all that you would call 'iPhone' contained exclusively by Apple; this dramatically dampens the chaos that could be potentially introduced by having too open of a system.  This exclusivity factor has served it well with the overall experience called 'Mac OSX' (I excluded 'Macintosh' on purpose because everything prior to OSX was a waste of time - ESPECIALLY my own!).  The iPhone platform is powerful, and letting loose that power in the wild could cause serious issues for the overall 'iPhone' experience (think of unwanted software rendering your iPhone <i>experience</i> worthless).<p>Apple is paving a new path with iPhone and the whole experience of iPhone.  The last thing they want is for that experience to degrade because of too much chaos.  This goes against the grain of geek culture where diversity is king (and I have ALWAYS subscribed to this rule).  But in the long run it will server Apple and iPhone users very well.<p>As another example, the 2008 Subaru STI is an overall dream machine that allows you to mod the hell out of it so that you can beat a Ferrari in a quarter mile competition, but which one will get you laid more often?  Which one of these cars will cost more in maintenance fees?  The Ferrari is far less practical, but it has its utility as a unique experience factory.  The iPhone is not a superior product but it is a superior experience in this same way.<p>The second you see an iPhone whipped out in public (forgive the poor imagery), you see a symbol of experience and quality, not a smart phone ('smart phone' is what I think when I see a Blackberry).  I REALLY hate to admit it, but there is a certain status associated with being an owner of an iPhone in that the whole experience it represents is vastly superior to any other experience for any other phone (disclaimer: I do NOT own an iPhone, I own a Blackberry because I need to get things done).<p>Apple is trying to sell MUCH more than a product: it is trying to sell culture and in order to guide this culture properly it needs to exercise crazy control.",1204905529

131230,comment,130979,130979,0,0,jcl,,,"""What static type systems force you to do is talk about the data flow of your code. This isn’t so that humans can understand it (though with some discipline it’s possible to create readable code this way), but so that the compiler and runtime don’t have to figure out what the data flow will be when your code is executed. It’s really a form of optimization.""<p>I've been thinking along similar lines recently, and I was pleased to see this put so succinctly.  If static typing is merely optimization, it follows from Knuth's Law that the first draft of your program shouldn't be statically typed.  The ideal high-performance language, then, is one in which it is easy to write dynamically typed code, but also one that lets you selectively type your program where necessary, without a lot of changes.  I haven't seen too many languages that do this, though; I believe Lisp allows it, as do VB, Boo, and Actionscript 3.0.",1204905297

It's dumb to outright ban pretty much everything, but I believe Apple should control everything that's put on their phones.<p>Phones can be forced to make calls through open bluetooth links, I believe it would be even worse for a contract iPhone to get a virus that forces you to call a premium rate number and netting someone thousands of dollars. At least with bluetooth you have to be in range, but with a trojan it could end up running 24/7. For example, whenever the phone goes into stand-by mode it starts the call and would likely go unnoticed for a good while, I've left my phone in stand-by for days, and have it disconnect whenever the phone 'wakes up'.<p>There needs to be serious control when a virus can make someone a profit. If it ever got to that, you can be sure the virus count would be up into the thousands as every hacker in an eastern-european country starts making iPhone viruses to net them a small fortune.<p>So yes it's dumb, there are better ways to protect the phones; for example a verification program built into the firmware and any time the verification gets hacked (if it does) they simply update the firmware and licensed software and any trojan would be incapable of running. This way anyone who wants to hack their phone can, and if they call up complaining they broke it Apple can simply give them a simple 'STFU moron, ToS violation'.",1204905104

131226,comment,131171,131210,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Or Apple could have simply implemented something similar to the Service process used in Android. A service is scheduled and will run as long as resources (memory, battery, etc) are sufficient to keep the high priority processes (the UI currently visible, etc) running. If resources become low, Android can kill off Services as needed. And there you go, no degradation of user experience.<p>I am curious as to the <i>real</i> reason why Apple neglected to implement a Service capability. The iPhone is effectively not multi-task capable and that is a monumental shortfall. I can only guess that they had too much to implement and didnt want to take the time (at least yet) to implement the service scheduling properly. Or I give equally likely probability that they simply dont want 3rd created applications to rival what Apple can make. They seem pretty anal about maintaining tight control over their walled garden.",1204904720

131210,comment,131171,131203,0,0,jws,,,"The built in applications also terminate you leave them, but no one notices (except for some browser apps where you can tell). The key is just restoring the user to the same place they were when they left. Word processors have been doing this for years. It isn't much code when you are in an MVC model already.<p>The part about not being able to run anything when you aren't the active program is more limiting. Clearly it is possible, mail gets received even when mail isn't the program, but that is Apple. I can see their point in restricting it, a single lazy coder can degrade the entire user experience and run down the batteries, but there is a class of programs that can't be built in this model.<p>If I want to write a system monitoring application to keep track of my important machines, that is easy and I can be very slick. But what if I want to be notified when there is an anomalous condition back at the server farm? If my app is running I can hold a connection and monitor it for incoming alerts, but if I'm not the running application I'm completely out of luck. I suppose the server side code could send me an email telling me to run the client, but that is a sad sad way of living.<p>I expect they will address this in the future. I can think of a couple ways...<p>1) Add a program to the sandbox that runs at startup but with brutal resource limits. Implement just the bare necessities of listening as efficiently as possible.<p>2) Make a remote notification manager of some sort. The server can make a remote call, the app runs a call handler briefly and then exits.<p>3) Do a cron-like operation where it looks at a crontab-like structure in the app's directory. Again, enforce brutal resource limits to keep lazy programmers from ruining the user experience.<p>All of these also have the problem of how to speak to the user during another program's session. A pop-up box is probably doable, you see those for carrier issues when away from AT&T and they work ok. The ability to play an audio message would be nice, especially if it ducked any existing audio.",1204903663

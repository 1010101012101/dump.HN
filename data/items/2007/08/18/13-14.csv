I've been through at least half a dozen now, and I've yet to see one survive as something other than trite, meaningless bullshit.""<p>This is best described as ""reversion to the mean"". A democratic, non-moderated site like Reddit and News.YC will start off attracting folks on the right end of the bell curve, and over time, gain traction to attract the unwashed masses. Then, someone will get fed up and go start another site, and the cycle begins anew. I'm not being elitist or snobbish; this is what I have observed since the USENET of the 1990s. It always happens.",1187445302
43782,comment,43635,43749,0,0,jmzachary,,,"""Authority (and potential for abuse) implied""? Well, I guess different things upset different types of people. Why does this have to be ""democratic community""? Is the ""democratic community"" paying the bills for the site? I'm not a PG sycophant, but I come to the defense of the site maintainers. I would rather read a sanitized and on-target news.ycombinator site than a mob-rulz reddit site. But ultimately, they serve two different purposes.<p> ",1187444942

But back in the 4th or 5th grade, I wasn't selected as ""gifted"".<p>The practical upshot is that instead of going to a different school and being surrounded by teachers who were in tune with my needs, I stumbled through a public suburban high school replete with all the drama that Judd Apatow can fit onto the screen.<p>I consider this a very lucky occurence.<p>Why?  Because it forced me to keep <i>myself</i> occupied rather than expecting anyone else to do so.  It freed me from a mindset of educational entitlement.<p>By spending this years in a regular school, I was able to learn take on a host of other activities that I found interesting at my own pace and at my own behest.  My intellectual development and curiosity drove me forward.<p>And it forced me to learn how to navigate elements of the ""real world"" that end up being speedbumps along the way.  <i>Isolation from that is a mistake.</i>  I've many friends who've learned that the hard way.<p>Now I'm a happy adult with a precocious son.  I'm getting worried about his teachers in kindergarten are going to deal with a child who happily decides if numbers are primes and points out square roots.<p>How do I teach him to learn for himself.  To realize that his school gives him a starting point for his education, and not the entireity.  To help him end become a ferociously curious individual who gets stuff done, not in some isolation chamber gifted bubble, but in the real world -- omplete with alliances and politics and emotions and conflicts.<p>It's hard.  It was hard to live through as the student, and I expect it to be hard for me to live through as his guide.<p>But it is absolutely the right place to end up.",1187444453

43777,comment,43686,43738,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I would never argue to privatize the legal/law enforcement system - this is necessarily run by the state as there are obvious problems otherwise.<p>The options I have now:  put my daughter in a ""free"" system that will destroy her future, or pay dramatically too much in a private school so that she has a chance.  I've chosen option 2.  <p>What the UN thinks is quite irrelevant as the current system is not only broken now, its been broken for decades and continues to get worse.  School isn't ""free"" now, it is paid for by taxes.  The problem is, there is no incentive for the public schools to get better, and they just won't.  In a private system, all the ""free"" money taken out of the private economy in the form of taxation would be put back into private hands.  Then parents could decide where to send their children, weighing the costs/benefits and choosing schools appropriately.  There has been and will continue to be very large sums of charitable money to help educate - I believe Gates now has the largest charitable fund focused to a great degree on education.  <p>The bottom line:  privatizing education would be dramatically less expensive (think of the immense cost of the beauraucracy now in the education system) and more efficient, and more innovative.  Why, you ask?  Because the schools would be competing for students, and the bad schools would go out of business as they should.  The good schools would get bigger and more plentiful.  The cost of education would go down as new innovative ways are found to provide quality education.  etc.<p>The alternative:  dooming our children to mediocrity in the public system. ",1187444149

They will only succeed as protocols for existing sites to cooperate. I don't doubt the large players will be slow in adopting this sort of thing, but the smaller companies can bind together.\n",1187443389

To say that only programmers can design successful facebook apps is a bit arrogant.  I'd say a lot of social users would be able to help come up with an app and make it popular, if they knew how.<p>However, almost always, you need a programmer to write something like this, as well as keep it constantly improving, since one can't just create something in a one-shot deal and think they're done.<p>If you are sure your idea is as good as you say it is, it will be worth it to learn enough programming to make a facebook app yourself, get it popular like you said you will, and when it hits big you'll be able to find tons of developers.<p>There are some business (or art) people who have dabbled in programming and made some contributions, but it is almost always 'hackers' who do.<p>I think the problem people have with this isn't just that the programmer might end up doing more work for a program that might not go anywhere, but that the ""opportunity cost"" (some business lingo) to work on this delays completion of something else the hacker is already working on (with more equity and closer to fruition.)<p>Finally, hackers would probably rather team up with another hacker (same culture, understanding of computers) than a business guy at our young age.\n",1187442951

But noone can tell me how or why that answer is a 'yes'.</i><p>Not that you have a mental illness which causes you to think like this, but you habitually thinking like that and the thoughts which support it <i>are</i> the mental illness.<p><i>It's possibly hard for you and most people to understand but when you feel out of place often you just want to leave.</i><p>It possibly is hard for me to understand, but possibly not. I've dreamed of suicide for a good half my life and got close to it on occasion, never talked about it to anyone (and hence never been diagnosed with anything) and put a front over it. I would describe myself as depressed, but not out loud. I'm also a bit stubborn.<p>I've seen enough basics about zen and similar that I when I am angry I can notice a part of my head which isn't angry, which is just observing. I've recently stumbled on self help techniques which sound ridiculous and found that just by sitting and thinking in a particular way and counting backwards, fear carried for years since childhood faded like gas from a deflating balloon. A memory which was charged with negative emotion where the mere act of remembering it triggered physical feelings is now <i>just</i> a memory.<p>Nothing fun I've ever done changed that memory. I never even realised (until recently) that said memory of a trivial event was at all significant or relevant to anything at all, it was just a part of me which occasionally popped up and I tried to not think about it.<p>It's these things which keep me interested and hopeful. It's these experiences which make me think normal people have completely massively wrong beliefs about many things to do with habits and behaviour. (such as ""other people's behaviour can <i>make</i> me feel bad"", which is just completely endemic and so basically wrong it's been written about for thousands of years).<p>Such that when you say:<p><i>By now you probably are guessing that the way I'd like the world to be (simple, happy and loving, etc.) isn't the way the world is, and that's very much the reason I don't want to be here.</i><p>I say ""I doubt it"", and suspect you might not even be aware of the reason(s) you don't want to be here - what pattern is it that you learned, that you have stored in your head, that is driving the link between ""not simple, happy, loving"" and ""don't belong, can't wait to leave""? Because not everyone has that link. So why do you have it? (and I also suspect that if you are ""most people"", you wont know what <i>kind</i> of answer to give to that question or that there could be more than one kind of answer and your brain might give you the less useful one by default).<p>If this sounds like I'm saying you should just ""get over it"", I am and I'm not. ""get over it"" implies you should steamroller through your problems and that is lame advice. I'm saying you should(?) try debugging yourself, and there's a fair chance it would be possible if you learned and practised ways to do it (and I likely don't know what).<p>Your want to escape and commit suicide is only ""right"" if you want to be running a program in your head which desires to leave and commit suicide. If you don't want that, it's a bug and should be debugged, not marked as a ""feature"" and left there. And you don't debug your head by earning lots, driving sports cars and chasing hedonic pursuits. You debug your head by looking at what your head does and trying as many things as you can think of (in your head) until you find something that changes its(your) behaviour.<p><i>With the facts given above, is it not possible that I'm just one of those people that see life differently from the norm.</i><p>JustIsADangerousWord. Do you <i>want</i> to be someone who sees life differently from the norm?<p>(Postscript for the detractors: Not a doctor, not your doctor, all IMO, yes I accept that not all things work for all people, yes I accept that some people have chemical imbalances. I don't accept that chemical imbalances are the cause of <i>most people's</i> day to day problems like fear of public speaking, social anxiety, fear of asking for a raise, feelings of insecurity, feelings of worthlessness, feelings of wanting to escape, feelings of loneliness, etc).",1296428308

Freedom from governments and your boss.<p>No, everybody is <i>not</i> ""in it for the money"". You said it yourself, actually: most people are in it for the things that money allows them to do. That is a very important difference, and it's one that a lot of people forget about.<p>Here in the US, a lot of the things from which we'd like to be ""free"" from (living in fear of health care-related bankruptcy, having to beg a boss for an extra week of vacation, being limited to absurdly short and unpaid (ma|pa)ternity leave periods, etc.) come with a hefty price tag, and as such are associated with (and often thought of as proxies for) having a lot of money.<p>In a place like Norway, many of the things that that we Americans see as perks afforded to only the wealthiest of individuals are instead thought of as baseline facts of life.<p>Is it so surprising, then, that people whose world-views are shaped by such a system don't have the same difficulties at disentangling financial cause and effect that we Americans have? They say that ""past a certain point, money's just a way of keeping score,"" and it sounds to me as though that point is a lot lower in a place like Norway than it is here in the US.<p>As an experiment, let's try formulating it (semi)-logically (it's been a while since I had logic, so if I'm getting this wrong, please let me know):<p><pre><code>    if (has lots of money) -> (freedom from financial catastrophe, and lots of social perks)
</code></pre>
In the US, the inverse is true:<p><pre><code>    not (has lots of money) -> not (freedom from financial catastrophe, lots of social perks, etc.)
</code></pre>
Because of how our system is set up, the converse is also typically true:<p><pre><code>    if (freedom from financial catastrophe, lots of social perks) -> (has lots of money)
</code></pre>
This leads us to conclude that there's an inevitable relationship between having lots of money and having the freedom that you talk about.<p>In Norway, however, the system is different, and it doesn't sound like the aforementioned inverse relationship between money and freedom is true: since you can have the freedom from healthcare-related financial catastrophe, a decent vacation policy, educational benefits, etc. all without having tons of money. Since there are different ""givens"", it's not surprising that Norwegians have arrived at different conclusions and attitudes towards money. QED?",1296427472

very well. None the less, please allow me to politely put on my ""faker""
hat for a moment to pick apart a straw-man corner case.<p>I deal with feasibility assessment, or at least I used to, so when
giving an idea some love, I'm not only expected to find various ways an
idea can work (if possible), but I'm also expected to find the pit-falls
to avoid and the weaknesses to address. It is simply a matter of
learning and stating both the potential risks and the potential rewards
so a more informed decision can be made.<p>The finding of fault, or better said risks and caveats, is equally
important to finding positive ways to interpret, implement and express
an idea. The <i>most</i> important thing is how you express your findings,
both the positive and the not-so-positive. There really is a difference
between being critical and critical thinking.<p>For example, in terms of rhetoric, your post is stunningly beautiful.
You crafted a rhetorical statement where no one can disagree with you
without being a ""faker"" but in doing so, in terms of logic, your
argument is fallacious (similar to Suppressed Correlative [1]). The
fallacy might weaken your statement but it doesn't make your statement
entirely wrong, and the clever rhetoric actually makes you look rather
sharp.<p>The people who can interpret an idea in a positive light are wonderful
to work with, so we agree on your main point. None the less, the people
who can interpret an idea in a positive way while still spinning an
iteration to politely address short comings are even better.<p>The point I'm trying to make, hopefully by example, is both the
interpretation and iteration are important, but the <i>most</i> important
part is fair and polite expression of both the good parts and the
not-so-good parts. You may not agree with my result, but at least you
know why I proposed a change to your idea, and hopefully you were not
offended by my proposal.<p>Personally, I hope someone here will take my post, find my faults, and

The only demographic that can really make that work are 20ish year olds coming right out of school. They haven't started real life yet, and have minimal obligations. Anyone else competent/qualified is probably quitting a job and has various bills and debts, and if they made the decision to do a startup, they already have some bootstrap money or a bit of revenue from a side gig, so that $15k isn't going to make or break them. For 150k however, this changes things entirely. YC can now attract a far more diverse pool of aspiring startups.",1296426914

Illustration projects are perfectly appropriate crowdsourcing projects (we've done many for startups, big Brands and some of the world's best agencies). Let me offer a few suggestions that should help you get a good result regardless of where you post your project:<p>1. Be sensitive to your budget if the illustration is complex. Many people forget that illustrations can be rather complex - and you're talking about a large illustration (which might have many components and may need to interface with other on-page elements). You'll attract better illustrators if you can stretch your budget a bit (depending on complexity, of course).<p>2. Limit initial scope. If you ultimately need a full page illustration, you might initially ask for an illustration of a portion and then narrow your selections and ask a few people to show you more complete illustrations. Asking everyone to do full page illustrations - especially if your budget is modest - might limit the number of participants.<p>3. Identify styles you like. Even more important than sketching your idea is a reference for the types of illustrations you like. Many illustrators have a particular style and if you can be clear at the beginning, you'll help them focus on showing examples of work that you're more likely to like - rather than just take stabs in the dark submitting random illustration styles.<p>I hope these are helpful and wish you luck with the illustration (and your MVP!)<p>Ross",1296426830

Most battery technologies use hydrogen as the fundamental energy storer.  The low energy state is Xx H_N, where Xx is some vehicle molecule, and the high energy state is Xx H_(<i>N-n</i>) + <i>n</i> H.  Energy is stored in the battery by converting from the former to the latter, and it is released by doing the opposite.<p>2. One of the primary challenges of making a feasible battery is that the <i>n</i> hydrogen molecules form into hydrogen gas, which is bulky.  To fit the hydrogen into a reasonable volume, it must be either compressed to very high temperature, cooled to very low temperature, or attached to a carrier molecule.<p>3. This technology seeks to solve the problem by putting the hydrogen in molecules of ammonia borane, H_3 N B H_3.<p>Is any of that right?  What is the purpose of the plastic encapsulation?",1296426762

In the real world most ADSL users find that their experience is nowhere near that.<p>Actually, in the 'real world' it's doing pretty good.

To take lines that were meant to carry voice and to get them to function at bitrates that a HF transmitter would be jealous of is not all that bad.<p>ADSL is constantly being upgraded to supply a market demand, it is not being 'replaced because it is dead'.<p>There is an awful lot of copper in the ground and will remain like that for a long time, ADSL has in this sense been a great enabler in bringing broadband to the masses, the other side of that coin has been internet over the TV cable.<p>From that wikipedia article:<p>""VDSL2 deteriorates quickly from a theoretical maximum of 250 Mbit/s at source to 100 Mbit/s at 0.5 km (1,600 ft) and 50 Mbit/s at 1 km (3,300 ft), but degrades at a much slower rate from there, and still outperforms VDSL. Starting from 1.6 km (1 mi) its performance is equal to ADSL2+.""<p>1 km is not an 'absurdely short distance' for a maximum of 50 Mbit. In practice at that distance VDSL2 (which is currently only available from a select few providers where I live) does anywhere from 20 to 40 Mbit, not all that shabby, in fact I can hardly imagine what I'd use that for and I'm a pretty big consumer. Oh, and I live about as far away as you could possibly get from the nearest POP.<p>> We're having this discussion because Bell, due to their ILEC status, was forced into agreements that favored some businesses that pandered to, essentially, the ""problem users"" who were kicked off every other network. Teksavvy didn't go to ADSL because it's such a great technology. They went to it because the CRTC cleared a sweetheart deal for them.<p>The bandwidth charges that Bell is trying to levy here are not based in reality, regardless of the position of Teksavvy, and I don't see any reason why people that simply use 'dropbox' or 'netflix' should be punished for that with these outrageous charges. No other developed country has such a backwards system. 'Problem Users' don't exist, that's simply people using the capacity of the bandwidth that was sold to them. If you don't want users to use a fat pipe: don't sell them one.<p>Anyway, this thread is becoming ridiculously indented, I'm going to let it go with this. Thanks for the exchange!",1296425255
2159330,comment,2158581,2158581,0,0,alextp,,,"I get a lot of spam on facebook. The main categories are:<p>1. Applications unwittingly installed by naive friends that post annoying updates all the time to my wall, effectively hiding the little signal in there. Each time a friend uses a new application I get more spam until I hide it. A variant of this is the unhideable notification that a friend started using a new application; getting rid of these requires hiding the friend forever. Both these examples require an action not simpler than using gmail's ""filter messages like this"" function to mark them as trash.<p>2. I have some relatively popular friends who are often unwillingly tagged in cheap promotions, religious events (they're atheist), musical events they're not attending, etc. This effectively spams all their friends with a ""this person has been tagged"" notification until they decide to remove themselves from the list.<p>3. I have also received unsolicited facebook messages of a very dubious comercial purpose that I would report as spam in gmail.<p>All in all the signal-to-noise ratio in facebook ends up being so low I have a twitter account specifically for keeping up with friends, and it ironically enough makes it easier to do the low-cost maintaining people usually associate with facebook.<p>Most of this comes from the fact that, while I mostly trust my friends, I can't trust all of them (as refusing friend requests is usually seen as very rude), and while I can (and do) hide friends, I can do nothing about the bad friends of my good friends, and those end up being a regular source of spam.",1296425216

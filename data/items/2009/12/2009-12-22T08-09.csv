The human eye reads optimally at about 70 characters per line, more and the eye has to work harder to locate and skip back to the beginning of the next line, less and there aren't enough characters for your brain to successfully pre-scan the line.

Granted, I'm only a mediocre coder, but the way I tend to program with a new API is to write a Hello World, then expand it outward. Add in one feature, test, expand it to another, until it does most of what I want. Then, I send it through a sample-set of data, and if it works, I'm good to go.
There's no way to do this with the 80legs program.<p>The second problem is that the code has to be in Java. I like Java. I use Java on my own projects. But java isn't a very fun language. I don't know many people who wake up in the morning excited because they get to write Java apps.  The thing is, the JVM supports a multitude of scripting languages.. Give us access to them.
Let me upload ruby code, with an idea, click-and-run against some sample data, and see what happens.<p>I have a old test project I worked on a year ago, that identifies images and tracks their sources.. Something like 80 legs would be perfect to ""seed"" it, and fill it up with data. But figuring out how to make it work is too much of a hassle, versus doing the crawling myself, and the speed difference isn't worth it to me. If it gets done in a week versus 5 weeks, it doesn't make change very much in the end.<p>In any event, I do wish them well. It's a very innovative program, and with some implementation work, I think it could do very well.",1261470759

1009606,comment,1009525,1009525,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Overall a pretty good, albeit quite brief, article, though the description of H.265 is terrible:<p><i>H.265 will be lossier than H.264, in other words, but lossy in ways that won't be too obvious to humans and our imperfect image-processing brains. Pause an H.265 video and break out the spyglass, and you'll find many technical imperfections compared to older codecs, but it's all about perceived quality when the moving picture is, well, moving.</i><p>The way in which loss is applied to the video is generally determined by the encoder, not the video format.  The Joint Video Team is still busy optimizing everything for PSNR, so they don't appear as if they're going to change the entire concept behind video coding just yet.  For example, we'd benefit hugely from coding-layer improvements to increase the visual energy of the video, much as Vorbis's failure mode is noisy audio as opposed to metallic warbling.<p>H.265, so far, is shaping up to be larger macroblocks, a few much-wanted improvements such as a larger transform size, and a huge amount of brainstorming that has resulted in an enormous number of really stupid ideas.  I'd give it at least another half decade before it has a chance of becoming a real spec, if only to filter out the bad ideas to find the really good ones.  There's tons of interesting stuff there though, and it's worth following if only to read the JVT [Joint Video Team] papers.<p>The real problem though is that H.265 has no chance of possibly satisfying the needs of those who really want it.  The cable companies <i>really really</i> want to be able to solve the following problems in one fell swoop:<p>1.  They want to have hundreds of channels, but can't bother laying new wire, so they want each HD channel to fit in an SD mux (~3.25 megabit CBR).<p>2.  They want to get rid of interlacing, but they also want the smoothness of motion that 60 fields per second gets, and they <i>also</i> want the marketing name of 1080, so they want to switch to 1080p60.  From what I've heard so far, H.265 won't even support interlacing, which is the single best decision I've seen out of the JVT.<p>3.  They want this all available in reasonably-priced implementations as soon as possible.  Oh, and it can't have significantly higher hardware requirements for decoding either.<p>By comparison, x264, one of the best H.264 encoders, on its absolute slowest, non-realtime settings, can make 1080p<i>30</i> look <i>tolerable</i> at about 3-4mbps.<p>In other words, they want a 2-4x improvement over H.264, for zero extra CPU cost.  They want fucking <i>unicorns</i>.  This isn't going to happen.",1261469864

1009600,story,,,17,15,dvd03,"Ask HN: How to analyse the real-time Web?",,"This seems to be one of today's extremely interesting problems:<p>How can we process an enormously high rate of incoming data such that processing latency is minimal?<p>What are your thoughts?<p>Some points to consider:<p>1. High rate of inserts<p>If the incoming rate of new data is very high, and if we store this data for any length of time, then databases tend to struggle. Why? Because, as we know, inserting individual datapoints becomes a significant bottleneck when the database is large, and the rate of inserts is high.<p>2. Computation across full dataset<p>Any cleverness on our part, to discern patterns in the data, may require our regularly crunching sequentially through all (or, at least, significant amounts of) our data. Databases are optimised for random access. To achieve this, they have overheads which mean that they are not optimised for sequential reads.<p>It is because of points 1 and 2 that industry folk are loudly singing the praises of Hadoop when they consider high rates of incoming data which requires persistent storage - (HDFS, with its low-overhead chunk archiving) and its corresponding MapReduce computation framework.<p>So, problem's solved? Not so fast.<p>Let's consider:<p>A. Inherent latency in HDFS and MapReduce<p>We know also that HDFS has an associated latency which prevents real-time analysis. This is for four reasons:
i) Data is inserted into the HDFS in chunks. Until a chunk is formed, it cannot be inserted - and, accordingly, it cannot be analysed.
ii) MapReduce has a synchronisation lock after the map function, so no reduce outputs can be given until maps are all complete.
iii) Reduce pulls output data from Map, so pipelining is made inherently difficult - even without the synchronisation lock.
iv) Hadoop processing only occurs after data is written to disk,<p>B. Order<p>We also know that whilst HDFS with MapReduce is great for unstructured data, many data streams are ordered - at least chronologically. This order can (and often should?) be exploited when processing. Exploiting this order across HDFS is not trivially done.<p>It is because of points A and B that we should probably be thinking of in-memory stream processing in addition to Hadoop - if, indeed, we believe that the community is correct in thinking that Hadoop is the perfect fit for archived data which comes in at high volume, and which also needs processing.<p>What are your thoughts?",1261469376

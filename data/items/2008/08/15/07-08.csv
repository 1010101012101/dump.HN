You are presumably in a good position to find a smart employee who is interested in your work and will be able to contribute within a short period of time.<p>If you cannot make headway in the market with two developers/proponents, it seems unlikely you will succeed alone. Not all of the work needs to be technical - there's no reason you can't hire someone and have them handle marketing/sales.",1218786793

Ubuntu has a GREAT community support and a huge list of repos, but jusst like qhoxie said, if you're developing it really doesn't matter what you use.<p>As is the case, in my opinion with anything, just how you use it.",1218786349

276854,comment,276687,276843,0,0,gaika,,,"Right, closer analogy would be object oriented programming, where some methods are standard (constructor->post, destructor->delete, copy->get, assignment->put) and some are totally type specific. The point of REST is that these type specific methods do not have to pollute your core / transport and can happily reside in your client libraries.<p>Sending email is best mapped to POST (create), not PUT (update), and the URL doesn't change for POST.",1218786304

276851,comment,276687,276793,0,0,gaika,,,"You can think of RESTful approach as an extreme case of object oriented programming when your methods are limited to CRUD.<p>Obviously there are cases when there's more than one way to change the state of the object that are only relevant to that object type. In the web world usually the full object state is already on the client so it is not a big deal. You can have your special methods in the client side library and still expose only CRUD methods in the service API.",1218785886

Yehuda Koren (the first commenter in the blog post) has explicitly stated many times that in his humble opinion movie titles and any non-explicit info has been useless.<p>BellKor, BigChaos, Gravity, and Gavin Potter (just a guy in a garage) are going to be presenting at Yehuda's KDD workshop next week. I'm sure other teams will also be represented. I'll ask them if they use movie metadata, and I'm pretty sure the answer will be no.",1218785734

CentOS is supposed to be a pretty good server OS.<p>However, I'd choose Ubuntu (and have) for this reason, amongst others: you can run the same OS on your server as on your desktop.  You might be able to do that with Fedora, too, but Fedora is not Redhat's main focus, like Ubuntu is with, well, Ubuntu.",1218785388
276845,comment,276657,276755,0,0,elq,,,"Correct. When using a latent factor method, providing an explanation for for the prediction has been essentially intractable.<p>A common post-processing step for many teams (particularly BellKor/KorBell) is a KNN. The KNN's are used to provide a sort of confidence metric and if the anyone so decided, using the KNN derived network for explanation is pretty simple and not really cheating.<p>Edit: Yehuda might have made some breakthrough - He'll be presenting a paper at KDD ""Factorization Meets the Neighborhood: a Multifaceted Collaborative Filtering Model"", the paper will probably be released after the conference.",1218785324

276843,comment,276687,276841,0,0,paul,,,"Well, I guess it depends how you define ""FIT"". It's possible to shoehorn just about any service into just about any model, but that doesn't make it a good idea. For example, sending email by doing a PUT to some newly created URL is silly. There's a reason that the english language has more than 5 verbs.",1218785196

I know it's not perfect, but it's better than the G1 that I replaced.<p>However, the one thing about this screen that I hate is the extended color gamut, primarily because there is no color management in these devices. High-gamut capabilities are great. However, since existing content assumes roughly an sRGB gamut, and this phone is closer to Adobe98, the result is blown-out greens and reds, in this case almost fluorescent. I am guessing that if Google were to have implemented some sort of gamut compensation, it would have further reduced the number of available shades, leading to more stippling and banding.",1269561043

I am not a web developer, but my guess of what's happening: active pages get cached, so 500,000 page views to the homepage uses as much server time as a spider coming across a dead link from 2002. The Onion updates frequently, but not hundreds of time a day, and there's only a (relatively) small number of 'current' articles at any given time. It wouldn't take that many dead links to dwarf the server processing time, as long as they were all distinct links.<p>As a web analyst, I can tell you that in general old, deprecated content does not get very many visits except from spiders. I would not at all be surprised if the marginal ad revenue is break-even compared to the extra server load.<p>Note also that they're not just throwing the traffic away. It's a decent 404. It's not the best I've seen, there's room for improvements, but it's directing people straight to the archive so they can look for the story they were linked to.",1269558251

In the parts of Europe I'm familiar with people seem smarter about <i>real</i> savings.  For example if you build a pile-of-sticks US style house, yes it will initially cost very little.  But maintenance, heating, cooling, etc., etc. will cost a great deal more for the whole time you have the house.

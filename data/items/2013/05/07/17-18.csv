5669573,comment,5668567,5668567,23,0,taliban,,,"I'm mbellotti's cofounder at Exversion. For me, the main takeaway of her post is just how different the YC interview experience can appear even to members of the same team. As the other female on the team, I've always found my chromosomal makeup to be a huge advantage rather than a disadvantage (especially after establishing some level of technical competence). Despite my own belief in merit over affirmative action, it's one of the biggest tools in my toolkit, frankly. Where males have nepotism, we have novelty and the promise of good PR. I would even go so far as to say it may give us a net advantage over all-male teams.<p>I digress. My own view of the YC interview is such, taking into account the magic of hindsight: that we shouldn't have depended on PB and our interviewers to drive the conversation toward market size. We should have anticipated the concern on our own and brought it up as it's something we're already used to having to defend. Should've, could've, would've -- who knows if that would've mattered, but it's my best guess. Then again, we also spent our 10 minutes successfully selling them on our team and execution abilities, which we evidently did very well based on the feedback we got in our rejection email. In fact, I don't think our interview could have gone much better than it did and I still feel overwhelmingly positive about it. Contrary to Marianne, perhaps, I feel pretty viscerally that we sell our team better than we sell our product/market fit at the moment. And with the caliber of applications YC sees these days that include companies with crazy good traction, we can't properly apply the YC priorities of yore (""great team, not much else yet? You're in!"") to our interview and extrapolate that it was our demographics that didn't get us in. As Marianne's (mbellotti's) experience shows, it is certainly something to consider, but it is just one of dozens of possibilities. It's also worth considering that demographics may have helped rather than hindered us in getting the interview in the first place.",1367949052

Every VC and angel is going to try to match what's in front of them to something they know when assessing the potential value. I have no doubt that YC will accept a great company that doesn't fit the ""type"", we spoke to lot of companies like that before we came out to SF.<p>What I'm curious about is YC's habit of ""fund without idea"" or ""fund for new idea"" ... how likely is it that someone against the traditional startup type would be given that opportunity? I don't know the answer because there's no data on what ideas people came into YC with, vs what they left with ... but it's an interesting question to me because cognitive biases are an interesting topic to me.<p>The people who think they are smart enough to think their way out of their own biases are usually the ones who fall victim to them the most often.

I'm not saying you should stay at one job forever or never quit even if things aren't going well at work. I'm saying that switching jobs because you hated your old one puts you into this continual pursuit of some higher calling / ideal job that may never come. Until you search, you're unhappy and every small minor inconvenience in a new job will encourage you to pack up and move elsewhere. Embracing the unsexy parts of life is the best way to conquer it. And then you can, over time, tweak and improve it. Whether that means getting a promotion so you're in a position that has more autonomy and more impact or leveraging the skills you learned at a job that you thought you didn't like to get a job you DID want to do at another company.<p>I just think it's a bit more nuanced -- one should not just quit their job because they dislike it.",1367947518

Sure, it's called the Windows 8 interface (formerly known as Metro) but when it gets down to it, it's actually a fairly similar methodology to previous Windows versions.  If I right-click in a blank area on that list of pinned applications, I get an option to see ""All Programs"" in addition to the pinned ones.<p>Basically, after an hour or two of using Windows 8 I became used to the new interface.

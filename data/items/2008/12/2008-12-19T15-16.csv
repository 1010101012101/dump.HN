The current worldview assumed by scientists is that the ""natural"" and ""material"" is all we have and all that can be used to explain everything.<p>Unfortunately, while this does form a powerful basis for truth in the empirically observable, it completely shatters and is horribly faulted when one tries to explain the unempirical and unobservable with only what you have.  It is an extremely powerful assumption (based on faith in a worldview) that the domain of the metaphysical is purely explained by the physical (the laws of physics and the material)... In your case, where does this concept of mind, self, and consciousness come from?  It's clearly powered by a physical entity (the brain), but the ""self"" is also clearly not a physical entity.<p>There is absolutely no proof that the system of material thinking holds water in other domains such as the metaphysical, so most of what scientists think about the mind and self come out of some seriously convincing bullshitting.  They really have no clue how it arises, and it will never be explained unless we manage to re-create a conscious entity ourselves.<p>With that in mind (pun not intended), take anything you read about how the ""self"" comes about with a serious dose of common sense.  This is where it's up to you to make a decision, because the scientists (while sounding smart), really have no more clue than you do =)",1229701005
403408,comment,403147,403147,0,0,time_management,,,"I'm philosophically a Buddhist, so I put consciousness (""mind"") first and wonder more about where the physical world comes from. Experientially, the world is not much different from a dream (except the sex is more awkward) but it has certain properties of persistence, regularity, and sharedness among ~10^11-14 sapient organisms that make a convincing case for a world of cold, hard matter that exists independently of us. But that's an illusion.<p>The physical universe doesn't actually exist, any more than a dream world does. There are probably trillions of universes in existence-- maybe infinitely many. They can't be counted, and they don't much matter because they're physically inaccessible to us. We're lucky, though, to be in an exceedingly successful universe whose laws are set (""fine tuned"") to allow for complex life. The universes that don't support complex life to observe them might be ""out there"", but they effectively don't exist.<p>Mind is eternal, but the processes it can support depend on the physical system (body/brain) to which it binds, and of course that physical system evolves and, sadly, collapses. We're extremely lucky to have our minds bound to such beautiful, powerful creatures as humans. We could've just as easily been bound to cockroaches or tapeworms (and it can happen after death in a negative rebirth, but karma's another subject entirely).<p>The transmigration of consciousness is taken as self-evident by Eastern religions, and there's actually a fair bit of evidence for reincarnation (refer to the work of Ian Stevenson). What's controversial is whether or not a mind-- or, at least, an unenlightened mind-- can exist independent of a physical body at all. The Theravadan perspective tends to be that it cannot, whereas Tibetan Buddhists believe in an intermediate experiential state called the bardo.<p><i>Am I butterfly dreaming I'm a man?

In the old systems artists who produced music people wanted to hear were rewarded with record sales and crappy artists didn't get paid.<p>With an all-you-can-eat model of music, especially for p2p distributed, how does the record label know whose music is worth more based on downloads.  There will be little incentive to sign on new or indie groups and pay them while the consumers will likely download their music anyway, assuming it is covered by the all-you-can-eat license.  New artist would be shut out of the system unless the had some sort of connection(corruption, manufactured pop group) to the record label.<p>And the record labels wouldn't even have to pay current artists in proportion their success if that success can't be measured.

As if <i>one</i> individual neuron didn't embody so much chemistry and physics and history (it's got your entire genome stored inside!) and complex behaviors (it's a tiny little <i>creature</i>!) that we can't even understand it <i>in isolation</i>.<p>I'm not sure whether to recommend Dennett's <i>Consciousness Explained</i> or to compel the questioner to work through <i>The Molecular Biology of the Cell</i>, followed by (e.g.) Hölldobler and Wilson's <i>Journey to the Ants</i> -- and then keep going -- before trying to dismiss the complexity of a network of neurons with the wave of one hand.",1229699588

Humans don't have a single on switch so much as a long bootstrap process that starts when the first few neurons start to link up and ends at death.  Although most positive changes happen by ~25 years old.<p>What we think of as consciousness is basically the neuron's that stop focusing on what is going on and start considering options that we don't directly carry out.  AKA when you actually catch a ball you don't really think about it but when you consider how you might do a better job in the future well that's consciousness.  The brain is not a fixed entity but a constantly adapting system and consciousness is really best thought of as part of that adaptive process.",1229699317

403371,comment,403287,403287,0,0,kragen,,,"To summarize, their new strategy is to make allegations of copyright infringement, in response to which, ISPs will voluntarily cut off people's internet access, without the music industry having to prove any copyright infringement in court.  Presumably if there were a free market in ISPs, this wouldn't work; the alleged copyright infringers would simply switch to ISPs that didn't have agreements in place with the music industry.  So the strategy depends on either suing the ISPs (in violation of the DMCA safe harbor clause?  There's no mention of a counter-notice provision) or internet service monopolies who can be bribed.<p>If effective, this would grant a music industry association the power to unilaterally exclude people from participating in the public sphere: no access to Google, no access to Wikipedia, no emailing your lawyer, no blogging about how the music industry is corrupt.  Given their remarkable lack of precision in filing lawsuits in the past, let alone their decades-long history of criminal conspiracies and abusive business practices, it seems irresponsible to allow this to happen.<p>I hope you folks in the US can do something about it.",1229699046

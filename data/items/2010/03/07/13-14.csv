It might be possible for some humans to survive in a movie fantasy post-apocalyptic world of pure rampaging feral aggression.  But the number would be <i>very few</i>.  It would consist of a few people picking berries and hunting rabbits in secret, and gangs of others occasionally sniffing them out and looting them.<p>In reality, in order for a human being to survive, he must have things and services produced by other humans.  He can't do it all himself.  If he wants to ensure that other humans continue to produce the things he needs, the best way is to offer something in return.<p>Certainly voluntary trade is not his <i>only</i> option.

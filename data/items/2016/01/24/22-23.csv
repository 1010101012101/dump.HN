That being said, I think that the article sets up an artificial binary between adjuncts and tenured faculty. There is a whole third leg of employment that is contingent full-time teaching. That is to say, one-year professorships, and lecturer/instructor/preceptor positions that employ people full-time, but without assurance of continued employment in the year to come (indeed, often with an explicitly NON-renewable contract). There is a large chunk of academic teaching from faculty who make an okay (not great) income for a year, but have no security for years to come, and are forced to go through an extremely grueling application process year after year (see this article from Slate.com on more about that process: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2014/09/how_do_professors_get_hired_the_academic_job_search_explained.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2014/09/how_do_...</a>).",1453676093

10964395,comment,10963401,10963401,0,0,TheMog,,,"I&#x27;ve been coding since we considered 8 bits a luxury and I&#x27;m still at it (I&#x27;m 47 now). I do it because I enjoy it and because I&#x27;m pretty good at it, plus it affords a decent lifestyle.<p>There are a couple of important points I&#x27;ve learned along the way that might help you:<p>1) Some people can code productively 24/7, but those are very few and far between. For starters, they have the skill to concentrate hard for a long time and work in an environment where that is feasible. It&#x27;s not feasible if the next cubicle over has a sales person in it who spends ten hours a day on the phone. Second, most of them tend to do it in bursts as it&#x27;s extremely hard and draining to sustain that level of concentration and effort for hours and days on end. What you see is often the output from the bursts, but you don&#x27;t see that they&#x27;re then spending a fair amount of time doing different things so they can recharge their brains.<p>2) It&#x27;s easier to do this when you&#x27;re young and pull a couple of all nighters a week. This makes you a hero, especially in places that thrive on hero-based development, but you have to realize you&#x27;re burning the candle at both ends. As you age and build up experience, you tend to be more productive simply because of your experience, but you&#x27;re also not necessarily that willing and suited to pulling 16 hour days for extended periods of time.<p>3) Most importantly, your brain is a muscle. Exercising it improves its function much like exercising your body improves its function, but it also needs rest. If you look at the way top athletes train, they push themselves hard but they also allow for sufficient rest periods. It&#x27;s the combination of exercise and rest that leads to the improvement. Take one or the other away and you either overextend yourself (and injure yourself) or you don&#x27;t grow as much.<p>Yes, I read about programming and play with languages during my off time, but I try to satisfy my need to build things (which is what initially drew me into software) by working on physical things instead. Things like building/restoring a car or motorcycle, gardening, working on the honey-do list etc. Oddly enough they&#x27;re not too dissimilar from programming as you still end up solving problems.<p>TL;DR - find a way to switch off, be it through meditation or whatever else works for you. Get enough rest and exercise the other parts of your body. Learn to recognize the signs of burning out and stop the journey before you get there.",1453675231

Just throughout the 5.0 series it has gained incredible feature support for almost anything from full multimedia faculties to websockets to a revitalized 3d rendering engine. And QML is such a breakout success in UI design and just general applications programming compared to the competition - if you have not, you must try coming up with a simple program idea and then try implementing it in QML. Compared to any other tech - GTK, HTML, even Android&#x27;s ADT the mechanism behind QML is incredibly elegant.<p>I dream of seeing a day in ten years or so where everyone <i>expects</i> right once run everywhere native look and feel applications out of Qt, a toolkit that provides you mechanism to access the full power of your target devices without having to lock yourself into whatever vendors SDK is and thus forcing you to rewrite the same program 5 times for 5 different target devices.<p>Its not there yet - just the other week I was arguing with someone on reddit about the usability of Qt on mobile and conceded it lacks a prebaked gesture support library to easily just do a two finger swipe rather than having to use the multitoucharea type to specify how two finger motion works - but it is getting so very close.",1453673613

Therefore, those addicts who are most likely to get in trouble with high doses will receive high doses, while the rest are left in significant pain.<p>> In my own case, I wrote down on my drug history that I had once had a single methadone tablet. This was prescribed by my oncologist while I was recovering from cancer some 20 years ago. I took one tablet and concluded, based on the side effects, that I’d rather die than take another. Nonetheless, one of the seven anesthesiologists that took turns deciding, a couple months ago, how much narcotic the pump would supply me “today,” took this fleeting mention of methodone to indicate that I was a dangerous heroin addict who had been on methadone maintainance. So he did the only thing reasonable. He reduced my pain medication to almost nothing.<p>This would suggest that even in 1999 the order was still your #1/#2.",1453672802

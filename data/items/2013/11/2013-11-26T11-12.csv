6800588,comment,6800384,6800531,1,0,chrisbridgett,,,"Facebook advertising has always appealed to me. The amount of parameters you can filter users to display your ads to is so specific, you can really squeeze it down to your exact target demographic. e.g. Only to users that are over 18 (so they can pay for your service), under xx age (whichever age you expect people won&#x27;t be interested), by interests (language learning!), by current location and birthplace (might be able to figure out some combinations that would be ideal for language learners. E.g. if they were born in the UK but living in France) and so on. It defaults to CPM, but I&#x27;d definitely go for CPC.",1385467084

Forcing or sneaking unprotected sex after being asked repeatedly to use a condom is pretty damned rape-y, and in some jurisdictions <i>is</i> legally rape (and by my personal definition, it is rape...consent can be withdrawn by either party at any point in the interaction).<p>So, yeah, he probably should answer for that behavior. I&#x27;d be willing to believe that one woman lied to discredit him...I&#x27;m less willing to believe that two women did so. Unless they were actually in the employ of government agencies, in which case, he&#x27;s merely imprudent.<p>Assange is, unfortunately, a very flawed sort of protagonist. Snowden and Manning seem vastly more sympathetic, to me. Where Assange has a massive ego, Snowden and Manning seem extremely humble...and I have a difficult time imagining either being assholes that force themselves on others sexually.

Back when I had comments on my blog, every article I wrote that was any good had at least one person commenting that I was a moron or some equivalent statement.<p>Great things arouse passion - on both sides.<p>Giving 10x the power to the people on the negative side just creates an environment where new ideas are discouraged, where important but difficult discourse is pushed aside, where things of true import are penalised out of the group&#x27;s attention by a few detractors.<p>There does need to be a system for flagging and removing spam articles, but if this system can (as it plainly regularly is) be co-opted to remove articles from sight just based on not liking them much, then it is broken. The people who have flagging powers are not responsible enough to use them wisely, perhaps.<p>I see at least one simple solution: lift the flagging privileges so it only becomes available to a much smaller segment of the population.

However, if we take in to account the major levers associated with a subscription businesses:<p>- traffic<p>- conversion<p>- price<p>- churn<p>- lifetime value<p>The easiest one for you to change right now is price. This will have a noticeable effect on your revenue and your profit. At the moment, $700/year gross is not enough to retire on (I&#x27;m making some broad assumptions about your lifestyle as well as the costs of the business); it&#x27;s also much less than the opportunity cost of offering your services to employers.

In your letter dated January 9, 2013, you stated that the firm is “completing the additional analytical and clinical validations for the tests that have been submitted” and is “planning extensive labeling studies that will take several months to complete.” Thus, months after you submitted your 510(k)s and more than 5 years after you began marketing, you still had not completed some of the studies and had not even started other studies necessary to support a marketing submission for the PGS. It is now eleven months later, and you have yet to provide FDA with any new information about these tests. You have not worked with us toward de novo classification, did not provide the additional information we requested necessary to complete review of your 510(k)s, and FDA has not received any communication from 23andMe since May. Instead, we have become aware that you have initiated new marketing campaigns, including television commercials that, together with an increasing list of indications, show that you plan to expand the PGS’s uses and consumer base without obtaining marketing authorization from FDA.<p>It appears that 23andMe is and has been aware of this situation for quite some time. In fact, the FDA has devoted significant time to aiding 23andMe in their process to compliance:<p>> As part of our interactions with you, including more than 14 face-to-face and teleconference meetings, hundreds of email exchanges, and dozens of written communications, we provided you with specific feedback on study protocols and clinical and analytical validation requirements, discussed potential classifications and regulatory pathways (including reasonable submission timelines), provided statistical advice, and discussed potential risk mitigation strategies.<p>The FDA in fact proposed a relatively simple solution, which was related to the labeling of the product.<p>> FDA has spent significant time evaluating the intended uses of the PGS to determine whether certain uses might be appropriately classified into class II, thus requiring only 510(k) clearance or de novo classification and not PMA approval, and we have proposed modifications to the device’s labeling that could mitigate risks and render certain intended uses appropriate for de novo classification.<p>Please keep in mind the scenarios in which the FDA attempts to avoid, in this situation. Particularly, a layman could consider their 23andMe results to be conclusive evidence for/against particular diseases and conditions, regardless of the respective error bounds for the data, and take matters into their own hands or simply prefer their results over the advice of medical professionals. Sure, there are T&C on 23andMe which state that this product should not be used in these purposes, this labeling is exactly what the FDA wants to improve. Limitations of assurance or intended use cases for products of this nature should be clearly labeled, and in a consistent manner. A startup (although 23andMe could be considered to be well beyond that stage) should not entrusted to make these decisions alone, and in fact, we do not have one such independent entity within this space, it is a growing arena within which multiple such entities are competing. It is not their business to care about other use cases, it is their business to stay in business.<p>A particular paragraph on 23andMe&#x27;s homepage says &quot;Understand your genetic health risks. Change what you can, manage what you can&#x27;t.&quot; I do see many individuals in the Nootropics/Quantified Self community interpreting their own results and indeed taking matters into their own hands. Okay, so perhaps these individuals may be of above average intelligence and are capable of behaving rationally, but this desire to improve oneself is not limited to our circle.

Maybe this will help: <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/voluntary\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/voluntary</a><p>Voluntary: <i>done, made, brought about, undertaken, etc., of one&#x27;s own accord or by free choice</i><p>-- Once again, you can easily find out whether paying taxes is voluntary by not doing so. But <i>you know</i> you&#x27;ll be forcefully hauled to jail etc, and your property will be forcefully confiscated.<p>>> Let&#x27;s say you voluntarily decide to kick a glass window. It breaks, as a consequence of that action, and you are hurt. Does that mean not kicking in windows is involuntary, simply because it sets of a series of reactions?<p>Quite the mental gymnastics going on there. Here&#x27;s a much better question: &quot;If you&#x27;re severely punished for not paying taxes, does that mean paying taxes is not voluntary?&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s another: &quot;If you&#x27;re severely punished for <i>attempting to keep your property</i>, does that mean something immoral is going on?&quot;<p>Yet another: &quot;If you <i>think there&#x27;s nothing wrong</i> with forcefully confiscating your property and punishing you for attempting to keep it, do you think you might have been brainwashed in some way?&quot;<p>>> Now, if you decide that it isn&#x27;t worth it to you to do something because the consequences of an action are worse than the rewards you would gain, it doesn&#x27;t mean that taking or not taking this action is involuntary, it means you&#x27;re probably rational.<p>You&#x27;re (still!) talking about avoiding the negative consequences of not paying your taxes, which is certainly rational, but changes nothing about taxation being extortion. In the exact same way, paying off the mafia so that they won&#x27;t hurt you is rational, but doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not being extorted, nor that extortion would be moral.<p>>>>You may have noticed the vast majority of people not being savage animals? Why would this be any different without a government?\n>>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re saying here; are you disputing that there was more violence, saying that&#x27;s not bad, or saying that this won&#x27;t happen?<p>I&#x27;m saying that the vast majority of people are peaceful and won&#x27;t harm you even if there are no governments.<p>>> It&#x27;s actually not. Capitalism is associated with a religious calling, as in the 19th century it was common for Calvinists/some Baptists to equate hard work with being more likely to go to heaven, and more money as the proof of God&#x27;s grace and favor. That&#x27;s where the shift to capitalism really started, particularly as an influence on people&#x27;s day-to-day lives.<p>Regardless of whether that&#x27;s accurate or not, that&#x27;s not where pursuing your personal gain started. Capitalism is just people doing exactly that, through voluntary exchanges, agreements and investments. All the problems you associate with &quot;capitalism&quot; (in whatever Marxist way you happen to view it) are rooted in the State, a monopoly on violence that all the richest companies rush to bribe in order to gain competitive advantages and to erect barriers to entry.<p>Remember, McD doesn&#x27;t force you to buy its burgers, and it has no army, no aircraft carriers, no police force, no secret &quot;courts&quot;, and no nuclear missiles. Companies themselves have no power, but will of course buy it as long as it&#x27;s available for purchase. <i>If there&#x27;s nothing to bribe, there is no bribery</i>.<p>>> This would be totally valid if people didn&#x27;t consistently make this choice, throughout history and today, and it&#x27;s actually extremely rare for the people to rise up and successfully rebel against it.<p>Oh? Well, you&#x27;re probably talking about &quot;Crony-Capitalism&quot; again, ie. the evils of the State + &quot;Corporations&quot; combined. Think &quot;East-India Trading Company&quot;, Wall Street, etc.<p>Why do you think it&#x27;s difficult to rebel against evil corporations that rape people <i>with the help of the State&#x27;s armies and police forces etc</i>?<p>>> It&#x27;s more likely that other powerful people want your power and attempt to take it from you<p><i>What</i> power? The &quot;power&quot; to give assignments to my employees in exchange for paying them a salary?<p>Remember, money alone is not power. It&#x27;s a means of exchange.<p>>> Actually, the main difference is a combined lack of freedom and widespread starvation.<p>Oh? Well what do you think causes and upholds both of those?<p>>> By the way, I don&#x27;t think I have a slave-master. I pay taxes, this is true, but I get a lot out of that.<p>Imagine you go into a restaurant, and you&#x27;ve got $500 in your pocket. Right after you get in, someone comes to you and announces that he&#x27;ll just take 50% of whatever is in your pocket now. Well that&#x27;s a bit strange, but whatever, you give $250 to the guy - you&#x27;re going to get food after all. Then you sit at a table, call for a waiter and order a nice steak, medium rare. You&#x27;re told you can&#x27;t have a steak, and that you&#x27;ll be served a shit-sandwich instead. You protest, complaining about having just paid 50% of your wealth and that you should get your money&#x27;s worth in return!<p>But the waiter remains adamant, and declares that you&#x27;re just going to have to settle for a shit-sandwich, and that if you don&#x27;t like it, you can go to another restaurant next door, where they&#x27;ll take %30 of your wealth in exchange for another variety of a shit-sandwich. However, now that you&#x27;ve come in, you can never be outside of a restaurant anymore. So basically, all you&#x27;ve got left is a choice between different varieties of a shit-sandwich. If you want to switch to another restaurant, you&#x27;ll first need to apply for permission to leave, which can be denied at will if the current restaurant happens to be displeased with you. In fact, if you make your restaurant angry enough, they&#x27;ll just take you down to the basement and torture you to death.<p>Now, if you see any problems with this arrangement, you&#x27;ll see the same problems with States.<p>>> Should there be tax reform? Sure.<p>How about reforming taxes to zero? Or how much do you think a shit-sandwich is worth?<p>>> Does the existence of taxation make you automatically enslaved? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Of course you don&#x27;t. You&#x27;ve been brainwashed into not thinking so. I get that it&#x27;s difficult to let go of your brainwashing, it took a while even for me.<p>>> I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re living in the same systems; in my experience, the government has trouble seizing anything at all<p>Oh there are plenty of examples. Silk Road is a recent one. Have you noticed how it&#x27;s always those naughty terrorists and child abusers that need to be stopped by cracking down on something and monitoring us all, and so on? I bet you have.<p>>> I think it&#x27;s really funny that you talk about corporations being more responsible to their customers than the government because you mention that anyone taking power has a risk of being overthrown; do you think that doesn&#x27;t apply to government?<p>Companies are responsible to their customers as long as paying for their services is <i>voluntary</i>. If a customer doesn&#x27;t like what he&#x27;s getting, he&#x27;ll just take his money somewhere else. You do this all the time in your everyday life.<p>Governments can be overthrown, sure, but all throughout history, they&#x27;ve never been <i>dismantled</i>. One group of sociopaths has been replaced with another, over and over and over again. You see, as long as there&#x27;s a throne to sit on, someone will sit on it, and the same insanity will continue. The solution is to completely disregard the throne and someone&#x27;s <i>imagined</i> authority over you.<p>Besides, overthrowing a government is preceded by years or <i>decades</i> of people suffering under tyrannical rule, and requires lots of people suffering and dying in vain. Switching from an iPhone to an S4 is a tad bit easier.",1385464482

I started with code-generation, and worked my way up from that, partly because I&#x27;ve always been very annoyed that so many compiler texts are so focused on parser theory (especially because most <i>production compilers</i> ends up with hand-written recursive descent parsers because they are easy to write and easy to add error handling to, unlike most of the ones generated with fancy tools, yet lots of texts insists on trying to teach tons of parsing theory that most people will never, ever use before touching on any of the other parts).<p>My series is here: <a href=\"http://www.hokstad.com/compiler/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hokstad.com/compiler/</a><p>(I just finished part 34 last night, and the next part goes up on my site in a week or so; I&#x27;ll shorten my buffer quite a bit over the next two months, I think - I currently have a lead time of about 5 months... )<p>It starts out fairly generic in terms of code generation, but I then got the stupid or brilliant (you choose) idea of writing a Ruby compiler, which on one hand is very interesting, on the other hand is exceedingly frustrating, and which I think lost me some focus - I really should extract the simple/non-Ruby specific sections into a separate text and clean it up.<p>In terms of other peoples series, look up Crenshaws &quot;Let&#x27;s write a compiler&quot; and Niklaus Wirths &quot;Compiler Construction&quot;.

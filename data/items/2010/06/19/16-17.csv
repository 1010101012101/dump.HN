1444895,comment,1444094,1444094,0,0,asdflkj,,,"Mathematics is a product of the mind; the mind is a product of evolution; evolution is a product of natural laws. If you want answers to these questions, it helps to look at what we are, exactly, and how we came to be.<p>In fact ""simple"" mathematics are not simple at all by any objective measure. Starting with any truly formal system, you need a stupendous number of deductions to get to things like elementary laws of arithmetic, or basic plane geometry. Mathematical proofs are not formal proofs--they are instructions for our brains. Evolution made the relevant parts of our brains the same, so same instructions lead to same results. That's why there's never any argument over whether a proof is correct, once a few people got to study it in detail. This also explains Hamming's observation that when proofs turn out to be ""wrong"" after math has evolved a bit, theorems are still usually correct. We find a new, better route to the same place in our brain, and recognize the hazards of the old route, now deprecated.<p>Okay, here is the key bit: if evolution made the relevant parts of our brains the same, that means it has arrived at a maximum, or at least a local maximum. What is the nature of this maximum? Physiologically, there are constraints on the amount of brain circuity our body can maintain. Brains consume a lot of energy, take up space, etc. So naturally, evolution ended up with a design where the same circuity can serve the greatest possible number of functions.<p>Of course, evolution only concerns itself with those functions relevant to our survival and reproduction. But there is nothing niche about those goals. If some general pattern occurs often in our quest for survival, then it likely occurs often in other quests that evolution never knew about--like building airplanes.",1276965854

(iphone notes can't be edited :( ) I think it is the best way as it is simple, easily accessible and open (text files).<p>Earlier I used OneNote and then Evernote but found out that though they've lots of features, they're pretty slow when it comes to accessing the notes.

The truth is a down economy is good for a startup because it weakens larger competitors who need large amounts of money to support their existing infrastructure.<p>Uncertainty: Job security is a myth.  Even if you work for a big company that's secure against going out of business there's nothing to say you won't lose your job tomorrow because of some cost cutting initiative.  So you really shouldn't let this become a factor.<p>Indecision: If you aren't passionate about what type of business you want to start you shouldn't start it.  So if this is a problem you should just stay in your existing job.<p>Debt: If you have good credit you can get a small business loan to ensure you have a consistent salary until you can get customers or VC money.  If you have bad credit AND debt you probably shouldn't be starting a business<p>Family: This is legit.  If you have a lot of family obligations you shouldn't start a business<p>No Benefits: Private benefits actually aren't that expensive.  I just checked ehealthinsurance.com and they quoted $79 a month for me.  As for 401(k) and such you're making a bet on your new business that it will pay out big for you so you shouldn't really be worrying about retirement for that 2 year period where you're trying to start-up",1276964533

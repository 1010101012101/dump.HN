When you are a developer on host A and decide to include a script, then you have already figured out that script is safe to include, so no bookkeeping is necessary. If a hacker has gained access to host A they can run any code they want, so there is no reason to prevent inclusion of scripts from host B. However, the developer of host B might have designed their resource so that it provides privileged user data based on a cookie. If it can be loaded into the page of host A it would give the developer (or hacker) of host A access to the privileged info of all users that frequent host B. This is why the developer of host B must explicitly publish a resource for inclusion on foreign pages.",1380624985

Pure paranoia. People sticking up for civil liberties are treated like public enemies&quot;.

I was hopefully that if we rode it out, eventually we&#x27;d somehow uncross the Rubicon. Good on you for doing so. Thanks.<p>> The main plus for javascript, is that it&#x27;s accessible to people who already know javascript, and there&#x27;s quite a lot of them.<p>For this particular context, I couldn&#x27;t agree more. The one caveat I&#x27;d put on that is that a not insignificant quantity of those people who already &quot;know&quot; JavaScript don&#x27;t really &quot;know&quot; it; they could probably be fooled for a disturbing length of time if they were swapped over to Java (and that&#x27;s not to say the languages are really that similar). Still, people with at least passing familiarity with JavaScript are numerous.<p>> The other plus, potentially, is that existing software may be able to run on it.<p>Yeah, that one I&#x27;m not buying much. I can&#x27;t think of any other top10 development language that wouldn&#x27;t have a richer software ecosystem for this problem domain. Even for the more general server-side development, the Node software library is growing fast, but it is very, very thin and represents a tiny fraction of the JavaScript software world.<p>> it&#x27;s not clear to me really what the use cases for this device are, other than that it&#x27;s a way to run javascript on hardware, and some people might want that.<p>Yeah, and even from that context, if you went with a JVM runtime, you&#x27;d have JavaScript (admittedly not quite as nice as with V8, but still enough for most people who&#x27;d want to play around with an embedded JavaScript server) along with a plethora of other languages to choose from, which I&#x27;d have to think would do a much better job of getting a broader selection of web developers <i>started</i> in the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; paradigm.<p>> My goal was, initially, to just try to turn the conversation away from language wars toward actually discussing the device. and its merits. I have clearly failed.<p>Hehe. Well, responding to questions about the language choice can do that. ;-)<p>That said, I <i>will</i> ask that question: there are lots of other efforts to package up Cortex-M microservers for sensornets and ad-hoc devicenets and bundle them with user-friendly API&#x27;s. I haven&#x27;t been able to discern what&#x27;s particularly exciting about this approach. What do you think is uniquely interesting about this solution?<p>> over time you revealed that you believe that being able to deal natively with binary protocols is a core feature of a language suited for hardware.<p>&quot;core feature&quot; means different things to different people. I look at it as a building block that a lot of core functionality for working with devices tends to build on top of, and a very important tool to have in your back pocket when dealing with a legacy device with lord only knows what fun little protocol bugs^H^H^H^Hquirks. It&#x27;s not that you <i>have</i> to have it, but not having it tends to discourage the rich development of that larger ecosystem, and in JavaScript&#x27;s case I&#x27;ve had first hand experience with it.<p>> it is a core feature of node.js, which is the api this hardware device purports to emulate. node.js is a kind of defacto standard at this point, which is good enough.<p>Agreed. My main problem is &quot;good enough&quot; is not exactly the kind of quality that makes me say, &quot;oh yeah, we obviously should choose this one&quot;. If someone hands me a Node.js server and says, &quot;talk to this air pressure sensor&quot;, I&#x27;m not going to say, &quot;it can&#x27;t be done&quot; because obviously it can be done, and without having to move mountains. But if I&#x27;d not been handed anything other problem of talking to the air pressure sensor, even if I was looking to bring on a ton of web developers with little or no familiarity working with hardware, Node.js wouldn&#x27;t exactly have sprung to the top of my mind. ;-)<p>> To my knowledge there are no standards documents for lua, python or ruby and people have no problem using those languages.<p>There are no EMCA-like standards bodies for those languages, but there are documents defining the language (though Ruby in particular seems to have a bit of the, &quot;however the runtime works&quot; mentality it is still shrugging off). That actually has been an impediment from time to time, though obviously not a huge one.<p>Lua&#x27;s language is quite detailed about bindings to the native platform and even has a specific type, &quot;userdata&quot; for unmanaged blobs of memory, and Lua&#x27;s deceptively named &quot;string&quot; type holds an 8-bit clean arbitrary set of random bytes, so not only are its &quot;string functions&quot; and IO libraries naturally capable of byte-oriented processing, there&#x27;s little friction for even ancillary libraries supporting and exploiting it. Ruby&#x27;s string implementation is similar.<p>Python has, as far back as I can recall, had support for binary IO and processing, though I&#x27;d qualify that by saying it has been somewhat hokey, though things like structs and Cython have helped mitigate it. Until 2.7.x and 3.x.x came around, I&#x27;d give Python demerits in this area, though not as bad as JavaScript.<p>> So what else is there that gives you the willies?<p>As I mentioned, there&#x27;s the probabilistic parser. When you are learning it is nice to have forgiveness, but it is much better to have each and every mistake pointed out to you. A probabilistic parser makes things less transparent. That can be worth it if you&#x27;re going with a &quot;do what you can&quot; mentality that makes perfect sense for web documents, but with hardware imprecise communications are just as wrong as incorrect ones. This doesn&#x27;t mean a language need be hard, it just means that you want to be painfully clear about what is and isn&#x27;t correct from day one.<p>Then there&#x27;s JavaScript&#x27;s bizarre and limited approach to arithmetic. Java&#x27;s lack of unsigned fixed point arithmetic has drawn some deserved criticism, but those concerns seem puny when compared to JavaScript&#x27;s quantum numbers that exhibit double/int32 duality. Not a good can of worms to open up, particularly when talking to hardware that might (per Murphy: read will) have odd numerical representations of its own. Even if you assume numbers are passing back and forth as decimal arithmetic strings, that&#x27;s a Pandora&#x27;s Box of fun just waiting to be opened that isn&#x27;t going to make the experience any easier even for programmers fairly familiar with JavaScript.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole async I/O, event driven callback model. While I personally love that model, and at first glance it seems like it&#x27;d be a perfect match for sensors and devicenets, it does come with some downsides. It&#x27;s a less natural paradigm for a lot of more novice programmers, and the way it decouples logic and injects layers of indirection in to the code can lead to confused developers when tackling new paradigms. Coroutines seem to present an initially more accessible approach to that model, and the thread model is initially often much more approachable for developers (though the popularity of Java NIO is an obvious testament to advantages of getting comfortable with I/O state machines sooner rather than later).<p>So there&#x27;s some more straight forward concerns. Again, not the &quot;it can&#x27;t do X&quot; variety, but more the &quot;we&#x27;re trying to get a fish to climb a tree&quot; variety, is this really the best way to get to the coconuts?",1380622734

I was guided by listings from Byte and Dr. Dobbs magazine and the fine folks on FidoNet and RIME/Relaynet.  I eventually learned C, tried qbasic and turbo pascal and eventually settled on C++.<p>I was initially driven by the desire to write a game similar to the first NES Zelda game, but for multiple people.  I got it somewhat working so 2 computers could play with stick figures over a serial or parallel cable.  My lack or art skills torpedoed it, but...  It was what kept the fire burning for almost 2 years.<p>I eventually learned Perl (to help out a friend of a friend with his business web site), Python (again for a FoaF), Rexx, shell scripting, awk and a few others that coincided with a move to Linux in the late 90s when OS/2 died.  The draw of games kept me in Windows machines from 3.0 to Win7...<p>If not for Joseph Carnage, Jerry Coffin, Bob Stout, Doug Azzarito and the others on the BBSs, I would not be what I am today.  Almost all gave their time selflessly in helping me learn to think and function as a professional programmer.<p>25ish years later, I&#x27;m still doing things in Python and C++ and trying to wrap my head around Haskell along with various and sundry things that fall in my lap and need doing. :)",1380622689

In a given year more than 25% of college students seek treatment for a mental health problem[1] - and given the stigma surrounding mental illness, that may be a gross underestimate. At Harvard about 40% of seniors reported seeking mental health treatment. I don&#x27;t know the percentage of women who use contraception, but I&#x27;d imagine its very high. If you&#x27;re going to provide health insurance, it should cover common medical problems. You should also cover things that are preventative so that people don&#x27;t end up needing catastrophic coverage. Paying for someone to see a therapist and take an anti-depressant is cheaper than paying for inpatient treatment if things spiral out of control. Paying for contraception is a hell of a lot cheaper than paying for an unplanned pregnancy.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Find_Support/NAMI_on_Campus1/Learn_About_The_Issue/Learn_About_The_Issue.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Find_Support/NAMI...</a>",1380621942

Few people do this, because you can expect to pay more over the lifetime of the loan, as insurance. Although the percentage has been higher now, since long-term rates were at record low levels in 2011-2013.<p>The big killer of homeowners is unemployment, not climbing interest rates. In Norway, you regardless can&#x27;t get a loan unless you are currently able to maintain a mortgage of 5 percentage points higher interest rate than the current variable rate.

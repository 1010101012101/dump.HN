I'm hugely disappointed after reading a title like that- and an article like that.

The majority are innocent but you will struggle to find too many people who will disagree With them beig investigated.<p>Being investigated for the possession of child pornography because of anonymous tips makes it far too easy to smear people and to use the police as attack dogs in personal vendettas.<p>It also basically gives the authorities carte-blanche to go and investigate anybody at all claiming there was an anonymous tip, and I think that for that reason alone this ia a bad development.<p>I realize you may probably disagree but if a person is 'so concerned' about this that they would report you but not concerned enough that they would make that report without being anonymous then it is most likely a sick prank being pulled on someone.<p>If it weren't then there would almost always be someone in the vicinity of the individual being reported that would have the balls to face the perp over this and make a non-anonymous report.<p>The lucky few child pornographers that only have cowards in their circle of acquaintances we'd have to learn to live with.<p>> If a concerend indvidual, perhaps someone who knows he guy, as worried by what he read and reported it what do the police do?<p>I would think that even a personal visit is one step too far, a simple letter that would state that the guy is because of this 'flagged' and if there is any indication that there is more to it then it might be time for doing something about it. Until then make sure that when he gets on a plane that his luggage gets some extra tlc.<p>> as I said, I can't help feeling there is a touch more to this than a busy body stalking Twitter :-)<p>You have a lot of faith in the law, which is nice.

People aren't calling web scripting languages ""the death of HTML"", afterall.<p>I'm not sure the analogy between languages compiling to machine code is a particularly good one. High-level languages compile to machine code because it's extremely tricky to create or update hardware to support high-level languages, and machine code is especially ugly. Neither of these apply to anywhere near the same extent to CSS, which significantly reduces the advantages of added abstractions.<p>I'd also be way of calling Sass a ""programming language"".

Because you can look ahead farther in chess, the intermediate scoring can be less accurate, as you have a real chance of looking far enough ahead to have turned your positional advantage into a material advantage.<p>Using the size of the board as a proxy for the number of legal moves, looking ahead N moves in chess requires evaluating approximately 64^N intermediate states, and go requires 361^N.  That means that with equivalent computing power, looking ahead N moves in chess will let you look about N^0.177 in go.

(So what's new?!)<p>When I was at Intuit, we had a VP (who was a management consultant in an earlier life) develop an ""innovation pipeline"" with checklists at each stage of the pipe line. \nAnyone who had an idea for a new product had to run through this checklist before they could produce a prototype , get some funding, time  etc. IIRC there were about a 20 questions in all and to move from stage to stage each set had to be answered in some detail. In theory it should have worked. In practice it was disaster. The answers to these questions had to make sense to the VP (who was very bright but knew nothing about prod dev or the local market, so nothing would get past her ""approval sense"") and a whole array of managers(and Intuit has a LOT of managers. Oh boy did we have managers everywhere) who had to approve of every item in the checklist  before the person who proposed the idea could start moving on it.<p>Soon enough, anyone foolish enough to submit an innovative proposal would have to send endless powerpoint slides in support of every checklist question, usually to be gathered by a set number of what Intuit called ""Follow Me home""s. When one manager was satisfied, the next would ask for more data on some other point. Then the first would have a rethink and ask for more data. People spent months gathering data for something that could have been bulit and deployed over a weekend and got <i>real</i> data from real <i>customers</i>  (and people wonder why Intuit is stagnant!).<p>What I took away from observing this ""pipeline"" in action, is that anyone using a ""checklist approach"" to <i>creative</i> work  should be well aware of its limitations.

Coleman is a software engineer who was hired by TREC in 2000. Prior to his employment by TREC, Coleman wrote and marketed a medical billing program called Clinex. While employed by TREC, Coleman, with the assistance of the doctors who worked for TREC, modified the Clinex program to suit TREC’s specific business and developed an integrated retinal practice computer application called Clinex-RE. Clinex-RE is a software program that integrated electronic medical records and image storage with a billing software component.

TREC contends that Coleman incorporated into his Clinex program proprietary information and trade secrets of TREC in order to develop Clinex-RE.<p>In 2003, Coleman and TREC entered into a Software Agreement that allocated the rights to Clinex and Clinex-RE between TREC and Coleman. Although the Software Agreement states that Coleman owns Clinex and that TREC only has a non-exclusive license to use and sell Clinex, Paragraph 8 of the Agreement provides that, “Coleman will not distribute, vend or license to any ophthalmologist or optometrist the Clinex software or any computer application competitive with the Clinex-RE software without the written consent of TREC.”",1263881598

The original IBM Fortran compiler could produce code as efficient as assembler. That was a design requirement. The issue in the early days was that -- for those who were capable -- writing machine language was quicker than having to go through the additional step (on batch processing machines) of getting the code compiled.<p>Furthermore, the original FORTRAN compiler was designed to turn algebra-like expressions into 704 machine code. What really made HLLs take off was the idea that you could abstract away the particulars of the machine. This decoupled programs written in HLLs from particular machines, it also made the abstraction layer much thicker than existed in FORTRAN I.<p>For a long time, there was performance gap between code written with contemporary HLLs and hand-tuned machine code. If you had a particularly tight loop of a program, it might make sense to write it in assembly for at least some of the supported platforms, to avoid the gap. Actually that gap still exists in some situations, but compilers have gotten better and Moore's Law has reduced the effect.<p>He seems to think that there was some fundamental cultural shift at work -- when in fact it was a matter of a slow evolution of compiler and machine technology which eventually changed the engineering calculation such that hand-writing assembler code has become a very rare activity.",1263880986

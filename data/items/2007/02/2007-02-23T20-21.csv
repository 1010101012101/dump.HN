761,comment,721,721,0,0,jwecker,,,"A meta-business model that doesn't get discussed enough- and practically never by VCs- is simple revenue based growth.  I know business leaders who absolutely swear by it and won't touch anything else.  From their perspective, if it's not making money and in the black when it's small, making it 10x that size won't necessarily make it better.  It's a well tested and respected business model if you're product and team can pull it off.",1172264283

756,comment,754,754,0,0,danielha,,,"I posted this article to extend on another one that was posted (&#34;Forget VC Money, Fund Yourself&#34;).<p>It's important to remember that a seemingly &#34;me-too&#34; site must drastically improve on the execution and implementation on an existing idea if it's to take on an established giant.<p>Or have better marketing. ;)",1172262651
755,comment,721,752,0,0,danielha,,,"Anyone can be a foolish bozo and try to sell a me-too with hype. But good VCs will be able to see this. <p>The me-toos that CAN succeed is the one that actually do it better -- they can implement an existing concept in a way that executes better or, in the case of a web service, engages users more effectively.<p>I just submitted an article from OnStartups.com that talks about this in a little more depth. Maybe this will spur some more good conversation:<p>See http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=754",1172262482

753,comment,687,687,0,0,danielha,,,"Ah, there's nothing like rampant speculation following an acquisition. Always fun stuff.<p>I must say that this is a far reach even as far as reckless speculation goes. The acquisition of AdScape more likely ties in with Google's business as an advertising facilitator. Google is on top of the Internet advertising market and it's time to look into online gaming as new ground.<p>Google launching an XBox Live competitor? Not as likely... but I'll keep my eyes open.",1172262218
752,comment,721,747,0,0,Nick_Smith,,,"1. Because nobody can start a car company without hard knowledge and expertise, whereas any idiot who can talk can con VCs into funding a me-too and blind them with hype.
2. Because the Net moves so fast that the me-toos are ready just as the idea is outpaced
3. Because the people who propose the 'me toos&#34; emanate a vibe of conformity and foolishness.... so if the person is an idiot we say &#34;me too&#34; if the person is smart we say &#34;oh that tech whiz.&#34;",1172262163
751,comment,739,745,0,0,Sic,,,"The problems lie in DRM, not the ebook itself.
Recently on TeleRead there was an article about starting a website with Creative Commons licensed ebooks. 
I also plan on writing another article where I'll explore what a publisher/ebookstore can do -- instead of DRM.<p>ps I haven't read HP either, just saw the movie...wish I had more time to read (lame excuse)",1172262012
750,comment,495,612,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Community is vastly overrated, since the easiest way to appeal to a larger group of people is to be comfortably generic. The best tools for a community because they're versatile and extensible, so the community provides value. If that isn't the case for the startup, there isn't a case for community.",1172261996
749,comment,690,690,0,0,danielha,,,"The Web2.0 designation will probably die soon, but the next-generation of the web is here to stay. <p>This is not a bubble of web products cropping up to ride the acquisition-hype-train (though many are). With the &#34;Web1.0&#34;, companies were being formed without solid goals and ways of monetization. The web has expanded so much since then that there is a market for all these novel ideas. If the web community deems a product or service worthless, than those ideas alone would sink and allow the best to stay afloat.<p>There's no bubble to burst this time, folks. New approach, new media, new web. I'm excited.",1172261949
748,comment,667,710,0,0,danielha,,,"It may seem that their ideas were initially as innocuous as they come, but that's probably not the whole of it. <p>YouTube's Chad and Steve say that they just wanted to create a cool site where you can share videos like Flickr users share their photos. I think it was in the Time article that the low-key third founder noted that it was pretty much in the plans all along to come up with a startup venture for mass proliferation. They achieved just that! <p>A great idea may bring light to a good business plan, but we shouldn't forget that there are cases where a good idea is born out of a great, focused business goal.",1172261667

745,comment,739,739,0,0,danielha,,,"A certain Richard Stallman (of GNU notoriety) spoke at my University yesterday on copyright history, current copyright law, and its implications when it comes to technology.<p>While I can't say I stand alongside him on all of his viewpoints, he makes some interesting remarks about ebooks. He says, and I agree, that ebooks restricts a lot of freedoms as a society. The potential of integrated copyright is huge, citing the DMCA and DRM usage. We aren't free to read and share these books that we bought. The books' authors do not have much to gain from this either as it is the publishers that are benefit.<p>Well, in either case, I was never a big Potter fan. More of a science-fiction geek, myself.

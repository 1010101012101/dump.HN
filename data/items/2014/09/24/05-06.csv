8360110,comment,8348473,8357349,1,0,chaostheory,,,"> Many factors determine quality and costs. Nothing you say indicates that labor was a decisive or major factor.<p>When labor costs adds an extra $3000 to your own costs that your competitors don&#x27;t have to deal with, how is this not a major factor in both quality and costs (either lower quality to meet price points, raise the price, or a mix of both)?<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98643230"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9864323...</a><p><a href=""http://archive.fortune.com/2007/01/26/news/companies/pluggedin_taylor_ford.fortune/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.fortune.com/2007/01/26/news/companies/plugged...</a><p>Since we&#x27;re on the subject, you haven&#x27;t provided much meat to your argument either: being that labor was a major factor in US car companies&#x27; competitive disadvantage.<p>> For example, people assume much manufacturing is in China due to labor costs<p>Low cost, skilled labor was initially one of the major reasons how Chinese manufacturing became dominant.<p>> but many businesses will tell you it&#x27;s because of manufacturing capabilities and resources<p>It&#x27;s only recently that Chinese manufacturing capabilities got better and it was due to rising labor costs.<p>As for natural resources, it is not a Chinese competitive advantage. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re very keen on striking a lot of agreements with foreign countries for access to natural resources.<p>> I don&#x27;t know what exactly you mean by &#x27;fail&#x27;, or if you mean the city or the car industry.<p>I meant the car industry.<p>> For the industry, from what I know bad management was a major contributor, as well as poor engineering.<p>Yes to be specific for bad management, it was short sightedness that led management to offer rich pensions in return for lower salaries in 60&#x27;s. This in turn led to bad quality. How? When you have an extra $3000 of extra costs from pensions for a product that your Japanese competitors don&#x27;t have, what does management do when they want to be competitive price wise? They lower quality of parts and materials, which led to poorer overall reliability and quality of the entire vehicle. Detroit engineering was not &#x27;poor&#x27;; they just had to work at a disadvantage. (A lot of those engineers now work for Telsa and other non-Detroit companies.)<p>> I think labor was too.<p>I&#x27;m confused. I thought your main argument was that labor wasn&#x27;t a factor?",1411538281

I&#x27;m <i>SHOCKED!</i>  Full story at 11.<p>Seriously now, did you <i>honestly</i> think that he would say to use xinetd over systemd?  Do you <i>honestly</i> believe a developer will advocate the use of a <i>competing</i> piece of software over something (s)he produced?<p>> There absolutely is a ton of overlap between what systemd does with socket activation and what Xinetd has evolved to... but as with evenone else doing OS design, there comes a point where you leave Xinetd behind and let the full potential of that trick work in your favour.<p>Unless you don&#x27;t feel like replacing small, simple, easy-to-use, well-tested xinetd with the 200K-line pile of C code that is systemd.<p>Besides, I&#x27;ve got your socket activation right here:  Start the daemon, have the daemon open a port, and let the kernel swap it to disk.  The kernel will swap it back in when it receives a connection for it.<p>Benefits:<p>* the daemon preserves state between &quot;activations&quot; for free<p>* the kernel gives you this feature for free<p>Security:<p>* the daemon doesn&#x27;t have to trust another userspace program with anything<p>* the daemon can use mlock() to prevent sensitive pages from getting swapped<p>* if this isn&#x27;t enough, you can encrypt the swap partition to resist offline attacks<p>Resources:<p>* If disk is too expensive, disk is read-only, you have no swap, you have no CAP_IPC_LOCK, the daemon would need to mlock() too much RAM, and you can&#x27;t encrypt your swap, there&#x27;s xinetd.<p>* Need to apply filters or QoS controls on connections before waking up the daemon?  That&#x27;s what the firewall is for.<p>Trivia:<p>* You can have xinetd trigger whatever event you want, since all it does is fire up a program and run it.  This includes alerting other programs, like a service manager, that it got a connection, and maybe even sending along the message (or the file descriptor) if you want.  There is no need for systemd to subsume this responsibility.<p>As you can see, &quot;socket activation&quot; is by and large a marketing gimmick.<p>> Me and the folks at Wikipedia:...<p>You think an article that compares data serialization protocols somehow proves your ludicrous claim that human readable text is <i>less readable</i> than marked-up text?  Maybe daft was too nice a word...<p>> Ah, so it is much more modularized if it runs as an executable piece of code in process than a piece of executable code out of process. Got it. ;-)<p>Sir/madam, have you ever <i>written</i> an Internet-facing daemon?  <i>Obviously</i> the bulk of the RPC logic lives in a <i>shared library</i>.  You know, a <i>logically distinct module</i> that can be <i>independently installed</i>, <i>loaded once</i>, and <i>independently maintained.</i><p>Besides, procedurally-generated RPC-handling code adds no technical debt to your project, anymore than the compiler&#x27;s generated assembler output does.<p>You seem to want to replace the RPC shared library with a separate process.  Not only will this make create a performance bottleneck, but also it makes it a single point of failure.  If it crashes, all your daemons lose their connections.  This is obviously highly undesirable, especially on servers.<p>> Well, that&#x27;s the discussion you&#x27;re having. I&#x27;m trying to talk about the design constraints and appropriate solutions for the problem domain...<p>I think I&#x27;m done with you.  You deserve everything systemd will ever do for you.",1411538045

8360092,comment,8356418,8356418,3,0,jzwinck,,,"Here&#x27;s my favorite way to get factors in your R program without wanting them: load an HDF5 file.<p>Python&#x27;s excellent h5py module and the official HDF5 tools like &quot;h5dump&quot; understand that a dataset is boolean if it has the type H5T_ENUM with two values &quot;FALSE&quot; (0) and &quot;TRUE&quot; (1).<p>But R works a different way: if you save a boolean vector from R to HDF5 (using the rhdf5 package), it will create a dataset of type H5T_STD_I32LE, which takes 4x the storage space.  And if you read the boolean vector as understood by other tools, you will get factors.  Then, the most amazing thing happens: R uses the string names of the enum (&quot;FALSE&quot; and &quot;TRUE&quot;), but remaps them to factors with 1 and 2.  So if you do as.integer(h5read(...)) you will get a vector of ones and twos instead of zeros and ones.  And of course R itself treats 1 and 2 as truthy values, so now your data is well and truly corrupted: all the elements are truthy!<p>That is: as.logical(as.integer(h5read(...))) always produces all TRUE values when the input is boolean written by a program other than R.  This is a lovely source of bugs in real software.",1411537865

If labeling and verifying the units was done carefully it would have prevented the accident.<p>A millinewton/newton mix-up could easily occur in a case like this one, too. The particular numbers which were misinterpreted in MCO&#x27;s case were often small, and I can easily believe no one noticing similar ones being a few orders of magnitude off. (I do have a hard time imagining it with MCO&#x27;s particular numbers, though.) Similarly, you can be bitten by a meters/centimeters switch or accidentally using different representations of the same quantity, such as specific impulse and its corresponding characteristic exhaust velocity, which only differ by a factor of about 10 when <i>both are expressed in SI units</i>.<p>I maintain that the key lesson is to always label your units, and to test them carefully and routinely, including at interfaces.

I was responding to a racist anti-arab rant (that ended up being down-voted by the time I finished composing my response).  Hasney Mubarak became an American/Israeli puppet.<p>As for keeping the Palestinians in refugee camps, the Palestinians have a right of return.  The U.N. recognized this right decades ago.  The root cause of refugees is Israel&#x27;s policy of ethnic cleansing (against international law).  Look for references to the &quot;red house&quot;, to find early plans for this ethnic cleansing dating back to the founding of Israel.<p>As for land swap, it doesn&#x27;t work that way, and I&#x27;m sure you realize this.<p>One bullet two kills, was not a &quot;few individuals&quot;.  And, it was only one of many slogans of the same ilk the Israeli military wore to that slaughter.<p>Current PM of Israel has not only said things like, &quot;... put Palestinians on a diet.&quot; In the context of starving the civilian prisoners in the giant open air prison that is Gaza (illegal collective punishment), but also was instrumental in multiple massacres of Palestinians.  How is a speech worse than actual mass murder? Read transcripts of the Knesset (Israeli legislature) to see the attacks on the non-Jewish minority-- including death threats, rape threats, etc. (yes, stated openly in the official meetings).<p>Started by Hamas is usually a fiction.  In almost every case, go back one or two weeks more than the Israeli propaganda, and you will see Israeli aggression, Israel breaking a cease fire, Israel assassinating a politician, Israel killing a fisherman/farmer/child etc.  That said, there are no innocents among those active in a battle, but the balance of power, balance of aggression, and balance of casualties is such that Israel carries the vast majority of the blame.  The ratio of civilian deaths prove who is the aggressor.<p>It is unfortunate that Briton essentially wanted a white-ish colony in the Middle East.  It is sad that most of Europe were only too happy to be rid of their Jews.  It is also terrible how Jews, Romani, disabled, gays, etc. suffered under the Nazis.  But, it is not fair that the indigenous Arabs of Palestine suffer for it.<p>&quot;Copied from the Nazis&quot;  hmmmmm... Gaza =~ Warsaw ghetto, Organ harvesting for benefit of Jews, etc.  I see your point, but it is probably not the point you meant to make.<p>As for antisemitism, everything is antisemitism (or self hating) in regards to criticism of Israel.  Yet, antisemitism is OK when practiced by an Israeli-- the Arabs subject to oppression and massacres by Israelis _are_ Semitic people.<p>Israel is an imperialist enterprise, and yes 7% was bought by Jews, I said that in my original post, but the rest was stolen.  It is a terrible situation that has only a couple outcomes.  Some radical Jews want to see Israel&#x27;s borders expanded to the biblical boarders to, in their minds, allow the return of the Messiah, some radical Christians want to support those radical Jews in the hopes that WWIII breaks out centered in Israel, in their minds, allowing the return of their Jesus, some radical Muslims  want the invaders gone no matter what it takes, and will gladly give their lives (and as many of the invaders as they can take) to this end.  Yet, the only solution today would be to make up (including honoring the right of return).  It would be hard since the Israelis are essentially the Afrikaners of S.

For UI, it quickly becomes what&#x27;s the viewport? What&#x27;s the real estate? How is interaction (touch? mouse? keyboard? numpad?). For persistence, one has to worry about number of simultaneous connections, character encoding and normalization, read / writes per second, synchronisation, etc..<p>So, also for logging - Are we logging client side or over the network? what&#x27;s the memory on the client? What else is running on the client? What&#x27;s the permissions through which we log? Do we care about a system call on this client given any user interaction? etc..<p>Logging, UI, Persistence, Network protocols, heck even just choosing an intermediate data structure are all tricky .. at scale across devices and indeterministic environments.",1411537162

And also, for the sake of argument, imagine that nearly everyone on earth has access to my soybean copier.<p>In this case we could fairly say that the supply of soybeans is ~infinite, and you only need to read the first page of the Econ textbook to learn that the price must necessarily fall to zero, no matter what. It&#x27;s a mathematical certainty for any finite demand.<p>You can pass whatever laws you want, but so long as they&#x27;re practically unenforceable, you won&#x27;t change the boots-on-the-ground spot prices in the market, which will hover very close to zero. (If you doubt me, ask the Argentine currency bureau if legislating prices works well.) Obviously the price will never be exactly zero, because my machine still needs electricity to run, and the market will perhaps price in a little law-enforcement risk. But in general these costs are probably going to be negligible.<p>And of course this has nothing to do with soybeans---the same thing will happen for corn and light sweet Saudi Crude #2 and intelligence reports about the location of Assad&#x27;s WMD or any commodity you&#x27;d care to name. And digitally copyable goods are the very definition of a commodity, for while not all soybeans come off the vine created equal, a torrented .avi is a provably interchangeable item with the original. Thanks checksums. (If a film ain&#x27;t on the Pirate Bay, then obviously supply != infinity, so my argument doesn&#x27;t apply).<p>This sucks for the business models of the entertainment stakeholders, but capitalism doesn&#x27;t care that you disagree with the market about the price of your product. Those stakeholders took profits for a long time, playing (approximately) by the rules of the game, and now they&#x27;re pissed that those same rules have invalidated their business.

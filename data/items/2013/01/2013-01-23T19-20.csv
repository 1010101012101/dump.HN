In terms of this particular problem, not really. I've come across it before, and understood it immediately then as well.<p>I think you are fundamentally misunderstanding the process/reason behind such a question.<p>> For example, does the triangle already exist or are we generating it/calculating it? Are we to iterate over the table? And if so then how? What data format is it in?<p>These aren't reasonable/good questions. That is, only a person who hasn't paid attention, misunderstood the question, etc would ask these. They represent a flaw in the reader, not the problem as it was phrased.<p>I think the issue here is you just don't understand the process and reasoning behind this question. You seem to think it's some sort of ""gotcha"" when that's not the case at all. There's absolutely no reason you can't ask questions like you pose. Everyone sometimes has issues with the way things are worded...and being able to ask for clarification is important.<p>I don't see how your explanation improves anything; it doesn't add any information it's just more explicit and convoluted. Many (I'd say most) programmers can solve the problem easily the first time they encounter it with no background knowledge whatsoever. I did it, as have many others. There will be many people who need a little help, that's fine...this is not a test to weed them out. It's to weed out the people who don't ask for a little help, or just can't do it at all.",1358971195

What you have to consider most is the target market of this misinformation.<p>If the target were industry executives and product designers then, yes, getting accurate information on new products from competitors and the industry would be important but this is not the case.<p>The target market is, instead, eager-beaver fans who are bored at work or home and want something to entertain them and they find video game news and rumours entertaining. I've been part of that crowd in the past. To put it bluntly, I'd rather tons of inaccurate information constantly streaming into my RSS reader than one or two accurate updates a month.<p>This is a simple case of the market shaping the product.

row 2: I think you are adding 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 to get 1 and 1
row 3: You are adding 0 + 1 for the first item, 1 + 1 for the second, and 1 + 0 for the third.
row 4: You are adding 0 + 1 for the first number, 1 + 2 for the second...but the directions say ""to the left AND right of it"" which makes me think that the answer should be 4, not 3.  1 + 2 + 1.  Really, you are only adding the number to the left of ""it"" (which still isn't clear).

Whether or not I need payment up front depends solely on the company, if they have a track record of hiring and paying freelancers or if I have done work for them before I don't really mind about the upfront payments (unless I'm short on cash).
For a new company I would ask for 50% up front or on a project that's larger 25%, the largest projects would be 10% up front.
If companies don't like the pay up front and you aren't certain about them, the best way to go would be to set certain milestones, so that you get paid for sections of the work you complete.

Try this one:<p>""At the tip of Pascal's Triangle is the number 1, which makes up the zeroth row. The first row (1 & 1) contains two 1's, both formed by adding the two numbers above them to the left and the right, in this case 1 and 0 (all numbers outside the Triangle are 0's). Do the same to create the 2nd row: 0+1=1; 1+1=2; 1+0=1. And the third: 0+1=1; 1+2=3; 2+1=3; 1+0=1. In this way, the rows of the triangle go on infinitly. A number in the triangle can also be found by nCr (n Choose r) where n is the number of the row and r is the element in that row. For example, in row 3, 1 is the zeroth element, 3 is element number 1, the next three is the 2nd element, and the last 1 is the 3rd element.

This is definitely possible. In my list of the 3 factors above I should have added a 4th: You find an awesome developer, whether through luck, having a great network, or knowing how to hire.<p>But it's just another variable that impacts that continuum I mentioned and pushes you more towards that 90% or 10% end.<p>>>For example, you've said on various podcasts that you're an advocate of VAs but have you had more than 1 or 2? Presumably, as soon as one works, you stick with him/her - perhaps that's luck rather than learning?<p>My success rate at hiring and managing VAs, developers, designers, writers, etc... is waaay better than it was when I started (at least 2x better, maybe 3x).

      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
</code></pre>
If someone couldn't understand the question with that description and graphic, they are either having a ""brain fart""/interview jitters or have some deficiency in their reading comprehension, spatial reasoning, etc that they need to work on. The former is perfectly understandable and will happen no matter what you do in the interview; the latter tells you that the interviewee needs work in some area which is useful information.<p>> You aren't testing programming, you're testing obscure maths knowledge<p>Not at all, to answer this question requires absolutely no previous knowledge. <i></i>All you need to answer is in the question.<i></i><p>You can pretty much just translate the question directly into code:<p><pre><code>    function getRow(n) {
        if (n == 1) return [1];
        if (n == 2) return [1, 1];
        var previous_row = getRow(n - 1);
        var current_row = []
        for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            current_row.push(
            	(previous_row[i - 1] || 0) +
                (previous_row[i] || 0)
            );
        }
        return current_row;
    }
</code></pre>
Took me maybe a couple minutes to translate the question into a fairly straightforward recursive function and type it out. From there it would be easy to improve in a lot of ways: caching, making it iterative, etc...all of which are relatively obvious and easy.<p>I doubt there are any interviewers who wouldn't be basically satisfied with the most brain dead implementation. That demonstrates basic competence. The question has ample room to demonstrate a variety of skills beyond that. I'd expect the better interviewees (even with  little math skill/background knowledge) to at least be able to make some observations about the properties of the triangle. I'd also expect the better ones to be able to talk about different approaches and their benefits/drawbacks.<p>For candidates with better math skills or background knowledge, they might know offhand/be able to write a better algorithm for computing the nth row. <i></i>If<i></i> the interviewer is expecting that as a baseline, sure I agree that's a bit unreasonable...but I don't think that ever happens.<p>I think this is a perfectly fine interview question with the caveats that it's very well known (and hence there will be some with a solution memorized) and one shouldn't rely on it too much.<p>It helps to have a good interviewer who will be able to explain the purpose of the question, and guide the interviewee if they get stuck. This is holds true for any interview question though.",1358968653

If you have editorial control, you're open to liability for not exercising that control. Better to go the legally proven route of getting a credit card and an adult signature, to keep all the liability on the user.",1358967758

I view this as a conflict of interest between managers and labour.<p>In this particular case we are talking less about general poaching and more about the poaching activities of an individual (Rubie) soliciting others out of personal relationships.  I can see why many jurisdictions actually enforce anti-soliciting agreements, because this practice is very damaging.<p>On the other hand, broad based poaching collusion hurts labour, who should be protected by Uncle Sam.<p>The point is that, such a conflict is natural, and I'm observing that the HN crowd in these threads seems to be surprisingly supportive of government intervention.  Maybe the libertarians are avoiding Apple threads.",1358967740

I could interpret that in about many different ways, and during an interview I'd probably crack. To put this in perspective, I got a 1450 on the SATs.<p>My thought process: I take a number, add the right and left on the same row, then put the result on the upper row. Or, add the left and right and current and put it on the row above. After a while I guess you mean any position is the sum of the numbers to the 1 position upper left and upper right.",1358967708

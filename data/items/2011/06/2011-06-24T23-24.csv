2694425,comment,2694102,2694394,4,0,jbwyme,,,"I think you are on track for an interesting idea but forcing training is certainly not the way to do it. I hate doing training in any software. UI/UX is all about keeping things intuitive/similar so new users pick it up with ease so there is no training required. Training is a buzz kill.<p>However, I think a piece of software that evolves is what most people intend when they start with a minimum viable product. What you don't see too often are benchmarks to ""grade"" users and automatically move them up to more advanced features. I'd have to think more about it to see how it could be implemented and how beneficial it would be but I think its interesting none the less. It would be similar to a game in which you ""unlock"" certain maps/levels/etc.",1308959880

Even the Max plan ($149/month) is only $1788 per year, which is equivalent to less than 2 weeks worth of man hours.

Every store would have to change their prices to the exact point at which the price of the item + sales tax equaled a multiple of 5 cents.

The homepage in particular uses white space around the headline and button in a very static, uninteresting way. The huge misalignment of items in the footer looks like something got broken. Know why? Because although the footer category heads are evenly distributed into four divs, the text contained in each column has a different visual weight. The third column should be optically aligned (meaning you need to eyeball it), so there doesn't appear to be a gaping space to the right of the ""Connect"" list.<p>Moreover, the 'About Space' block is crashing into the text on the left. Even the Space logo is poorly kerned, causing the A to float in an ambiguous way.<p>Take away what you can from the article submitted as there are some sensible tips, but don't don't pay for this template hoping for something competently designed. My design advice is to trust your eyes. Designers use some rules of thumb but looking carefully for the places where the rules fail is how you get to be great at setting type. Even a great template can't guarantee to make _your_ content look great.",1308959297

It's clean, elegant and simple. Easy and not intimidating to use.<p>As you use the product, your needs begin to increase and suddenly you need a new feature. As it turns out, the product actually supports this feature and so you turn it on. Now, you are turning on feature X, not feature package premium--just feature X.<p>In fact, the product actually has several additional features and functionality that can be enabled and disabled one at a time. None of these ""extra"" features cost ""extra"". They are all included in the base price of the package.<p>What if your product has a training module, where users can be guided through test use case scenarios that expose and demonstrate new feature modules. And what if we make it so that when you enable a new feature on the product, that feature only shows up to users who have completed the training guide for the new feature in the module.<p>In other words, in order for any specific extra feature to show up it needs to be:<p><pre><code>    1) Turned on by the administrator.
    2) Flagged as ""trained"" on a per agent basis.

Victorian Era - Vampires: fear of blood/rabies/sexuality/nobility<p>4. Industrial Revolution - Frankenstein: fear of the implications of medical science<p>5. Pre-World War II - King Kong: fear of the undiscovered/uncharted/unconquered<p>6. Post-World War II - Godzilla: fear of the discovered/nuclear technology<p>7. Baby Boom - Robots: fear of rapid technological progress<p>8. Internet Revolution - Zombies: fear of the lack of technology<p>Somewhere between #7 and #8 we changed our minds about technology.  We went from being afraid the future would move on without us, to being afraid that we'd lose everything we've built.  And take a look at who creates the monster - it's not the guy tinkering with science anymore, it's usually some prideful oaf abusing the scientist.

If you do that, it'd also be nice to have an option for a ""condensed"" view--with smaller or non-existent pictures, different layout, etc.<p>* The [Like] button seems a little funny where it is, but I can't think of a better pl--that's not true, I'd prefer it at the bottom. Um, I can't think of a better place with respect to actually getting people to click it, so I guess it's fine where it is. Some might say it fills in the space nicely, I'd say that I'd prefer a more minimalist look (and that the background is exciting enough as it is).<p>More major ideas--take 'em or leave 'em:<p>* Accounts. These would enable:<p>* Bookmarking (aka ""saving"", in reddit-lingo)<p>* Customizing the sources scraped. The option to remove a few defaults would be nice. The option to add more sources would be fantastic.<p>* Persistence for the UI settings suggested above.<p>* The ability to tag some sources as being ""must-read"" (or whatever) and then keeping track of which stories are read/unread.<p>* Probably other things that I can't think of right now. And maybe users themselves will start requesting things.<p>As I said, these are more major ideas that I just came up with on the fly (I'm not even proofreading this...). Some may not be in line with what you want the site to be, some may be just plain awful. Do what you want :)",1308956826

2694280,comment,2693210,2693707,11,0,tzs,,,"I once spent some time thinking about a way to help restaurant entrepreneurs (and make some money off of them). I didn't think of the analogy to YCombinator, but it is kind of the same idea. Here's my idea.<p>You build a restaurant, with a special kitchen. The kitchen is split into 4 or so separate work area, each fully equipped and with room for a chef and his assistants to work. There is one shared pantry and shared big walk in refrigerator. Each of the separate work areas has its own smaller pantry and fridge.<p>Each of the separate work areas is run by a separate chef, who leases the spot from you. There is a single menu, with a section for each chef's dishes, and the menu makes sure to prominently name the chefs.<p>You handle front of house. You also handle the wine, and maybe you also run a bar. You also keep the shared pantry and fridge stocked with all the ingredients that should be found in any fine restaurant's kitchen. (The individual chefs deal with stocking any speciality ingredients they need). Decor, advertising, and basically everything else other than composing the menu and cooking the food is handled by you.<p>The chefs set the prices in their section of the menu. You handle all the money, calculating each chef's share and paying them. You deal with the accounting, taxes, and all that.<p>The idea here is that a young, talented chef who doesn't yet have the resources to go out and open a restaurant can lease a spot in your food incubator, where all he has to worry about is covering 1/4th of a menu with fine food and building up a following. When he's well known and people are coming in just to eat his food, he can go off and start his own restaurant (perhaps with an investment from you--you've had a chance to see how he is as a chef, and to see at least some of his management skills by watching him manage his assistants).<p>Note also that this is a good place for the diners. When you are going out with someone, and you want Italian and they want Mexican, why argue about it?  Go to the food incubator and one of you can order from the Italian chef's part of the menu and one from the Mexican chef's part of the menu. Think of it as essentially the fine dining or gourmet equivalent of the food court.<p>The beauty of this is that there are ALWAYS going to be young chefs who want to get out from being an anonymous sous chef at someone else's restaurant and move up to their own place, and so there should always be chefs eager to lease a spot at your food incubator to get that started. If they succeed, great! If they fail, there's someone else to take their place--and since you are making your money out of leasing space to them, you make money in either case. (On top of what you are getting for the wine and bar).",1308956425

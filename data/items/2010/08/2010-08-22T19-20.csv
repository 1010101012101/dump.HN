Maybe their enforcement has gotten better since then, but city taxes are typically a breeze to skip out on.<p>When I moved to LA I discovered the city tax code here, which gives you a bunch of reasonable exemptions, particularly if you make less than $100k gross you don't pay city business taxes. New businesses are also exempt their first year. And if you screw it up the city will actually have a friendly conversation with you about it and try to help. Can't picture that ever happening in Philly haha<p>But honestly, politicians have been telling people for years they are getting rid of the wage tax and it never happens. Its just a huge insult to the workers and small businesses that are trying to make the city a better place to live. There has to be a better way to restructure taxes in philly.",1282504374

And I think the role of comments is to add value to the posts. If you want to rebut a post, then you can create your own blog and post your rebuttal there.""<p>Something about this rubs me the wrong way-- probably the fact that it assumes that rebutting a post doesn't add any value. If I (or Dave Winer) post about something and completely mischaracterize what it is, how it functions, what it means, etc., a comment that rebuts that mistake is certainly quite valuable. It gives the author a chance to revise or reconsider his opinion or take on the matter.<p>A blog post disagreeing with a high-profile author like Dave Winer is unlikely to have the same kind of impact, especially when it comes from a low-profile site (which, let's face it, most blogs are). It is far too easy for an author to ignore dissenting posts at other sites than it is a highly-visible comment that appears directly under the post in question.<p>IMHO, Dave Winer is a particularly bad comment moderator-- he routinely removes comments that disagree with his opinions simply because of that disagreement. Anecdotally, I no longer comment at Scripting News precisely because he banned my OpenID from the site when I disagreed with one of his more volatile political posts. Not particularly strong evidence, I know, but it is a routine event at SN to see Winer completely shut down or remove posts that differ with his opinions.<p>Now, as Winer is fond of saying, those dissenters are certainly capable of starting a free blog an any number of free services (or going so far as to transform an old PC into a Wordpress site of their very own), but, as I've mentioned before, this certainly doesn't merit the same level of visibility that posting a comment does.<p>All of which is to say: I read the above and don't necessarily see Winer trying to ""improve"" his site. I see him trying to justify marginalizing those who disagree with him.",1282503765

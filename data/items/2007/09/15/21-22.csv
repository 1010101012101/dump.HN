The point is that retaining familiar elements doesn't doom us to stagnation. Incremental improvements are usually sufficient and more successful.",1189893450

If it's a blogging tool, why is it better than Typepad, Blogger, or Wordpress? I'm not trying to be a jerk, I'd just really like someone to give me their take on why this is a good business idea, and how it could possibly be defensible.<p>The ""feature-a-day"" thing was a clever marketing idea; it did keep me coming back. But where was it going? Where is this going?\n",1189892740

And I certainly wouldn't want to invest in his startup :)""<p>This one made me laugh a little.  What did people want from gmail, Paul?  Folders, right?  Lots of good folder-related features.  Did you give it to them?  Nope.  You made search work right, threaded the conversations, and to hell with what people wanted.  You gave'em what they didn't know they wanted (but what was right).  And you were right to do so.<p>Sure, now you have labels, which are just like folders only not called folders, but I'm pretty sure you weren't around for that (or at least you didn't push for labels if you were around for it).",1189892574
55031,comment,54977,55014,0,0,sverrejoh,,,"It seems like a relaunch of Infogami.com, but with a really clever entry point. Infogami had a couple of cool ideas, like ""we'll release one new feature every day"" and optional commercials (support us if you want). I liked Infogami, but I stopped using it when Aaron stopped doing any development on it. ",1189892464
55030,comment,54834,55016,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Wow, we're definitely on opposite sides of this one.""<p>Not sure where you got that.  All of my posts on this topic should make clear that I'm a very big Rand fan, and have read all of her books (really, all of them).  I would never call myself a SOME-PERSONS-NAMEian of any sort, so perhaps that's the difference.  I do sometimes refer to myself as an anarcho-capitalist, so, philosophically, your Rothbardian views and mine probably coincide more than they differ.  ;-)<p>I actually did enjoy Atlas Shrugged.  But the speech is too much, the book too long (by about half), and the characters are weak (for such a long book).  When I first started reading Rand, I wanted to share her books with everybody.  So I recommended Atlas, her opus, to everybody I knew.  None of them made it through the book.  All got bogged down in the speech, and either gave up, or skimmed the rest of it.  Even people who were reasonably heavy readers (though mostly pulp) still couldn't stomach the whole thing.  I started recommending Anthem after that, and everybody made it through...everybody enjoyed it...and some went on to read other Rand books (I recommend The Fountainhead next).<p>I still believe that intelligent people can get everything they really need to know about Rand's philosophy from Anthem.  And, of course, dumb folks can actually read Anthem, understand it, and enjoy it.<p>But, you're definitely weird to think ""Catcher in the Rye"" is shallow.  Perhaps you like a lot of words in your stories.  I don't.  Word of advice: Stay away from Hemingway, you won't like it. ",1189892389

55023,comment,54834,54834,0,0,shawndrost,,,"Is Ayn saying that the individual is more important than the collective, or that the best route to collective improvement is through selfishness?  I suspect it's the latter, but Ayn and her followers frame the debate so combatively that it's hard to be sure.  I see this confusion rearing its head throughout this page.<p>(I read the first 100 pages of Atlas Shrugged, and got sick of it.  I thought it was uninteresting as a novel and inefficient and not rigorous as a treatise.  This part of the novel seemed to intentionally perpetuate my confusion: the conflict, as I recall, was between truly selfish people and collectivists that were too incompetent to see when the selfish people were doing collective good.  Why conflate incompetence and collectivism?)",1189891769

An article's appearance on foundread.com must kill off the 'critical thinking 101' brain cells or something...<p>1)  The author's examples aren't terribly convincing, especially when they're trying to support an argument followed by the ever-definitive 'Always.'<p>2)  In 3 out of 3 examples, his gut totally rocked.  In fact, I don't think I've ever seen a more statistically significant sample.

I've long since moved on from objectivism (I'm now a Rothbardian), but it was Rand who first got me thinking coherently about property and social obligation.  OTOH, I found <i>Cather in the Rye</i> pretty shallow, and <i>Slaughter Five</i> just seemed like dada.  Vonnegut did some great work (Harrison Bergeron comes to mind), but that book is not among it.",1189890954

You know, finally I did what one of us should have done some 8 or 9 messages back - I went and checked what you actually wrote:<p>> the popularity of her books <i>suggests</i> otherwise <i>[my emphasis]</i><p>In other words, you weren't actually making the claim I thought you were - that popularity <i>implies</i> quality. So I'm sorry for missing your point originally.<p>I do disagree that popularity is evidence of quality; popularity is only evidence of broad appeal, and you'd still need to demonstrate a correlation between broad appeal and quality - I contend that no correlation exists. But that's a reasonable debate, not a logical fallacy.<p>But I have to ask - why didn't you <i>tell</i> me that I was refuting an argument you hadn't made...?",1189890679

55013,comment,54834,54974,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Think about it this way: how much would you respect an artist that had no personal vision or personal style in his work, but just did whatever his clients wanted so that there was no consistent character at all in his art?  Can you name any respected artist that works this way?  My guess is no.<p>The point here is that for an artist to make authentic art, the work has to be a reflection of that artist's core values regardless of what they are.  It is that core that gives consistency to an artists work, and it is being true to that core that is necessary (but not sufficient) to make meaningful art.<p>Rand's point was not at all that Roark would ""force"" his work on his clients for whom Roark could care less, but rather that the client had to choose Roark because Roark's work resonated with the values of the client in the same way that someone who buys art is hopefully doing so because that art resonates with their values.<p>The point Rand was making was that culturally the kind of art Roark was producing, in the beginning of the book, is not popular and that only a few desired it.  By the end of the book, Roark had found success in finding a growing body of clients who wanted his style of design.  He had found his niche and had remained true to his core values as an artist - integrity being the primary one.",1189890259

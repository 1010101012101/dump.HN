I find the idea of finding fourteenth century artifacts from China on (say) Zanzibar one of the coolest things imaginable.<p>I also really like that the ships were abandoned.  The cultural turn and dynastic politics required are also really fascinating.  The treasure fleets play a role in Kim Stanley Robinson's <i>Years Of Rice And Salt</i>, which is a counterfactual history book that was right in my wheelhouse, much more interesting than German Zombie Nazis take over Mars or what have you.",1291474693

Some companies have the revenue from day one, but never reach profitability<p>2. Some don't have revenue at day one but are profitable.<p>For example, most consulting businesses, when started by people who already have the chops for what they're doing and have clients lined up, tends to be like #1.<p>A company that needs to scale up it's online presence to be effective (for example, something that works on user network effect like ebay/craigslist/etc.) may not take in money during the product development phase, tend be be like #2.<p>You can also be a hybrid, like 37 signals that went from consulting and design for others to selling their own apps. I tend to think that this is one of the better methods of bootstrapping - you get exposure to customers and business methods, and can see where needs are, then target them, all the while taking in revenue.<p>The downside is that bootstrap method is that your consulting could cause contention for time/resources - you have to want to do both and be good at balancing them.

  * Conditional execution for parallel code
  * Low cost to set up a parallel thread/tasklet

And also next year AVX will revive x86's SIMD.<p><pre><code>  * Double sized registers

  * No alignment madness

But there are many other complementary products, and Pinch Media has shown that free app usage drops by 50% within 10 days[1]. Even though paid app usage is equally steep, the developer has already captured the revenue up-front.<p>So the takeaway from this is to make a well-timed paid release first, _THEN_ make it ad-driven after sales have tapered off to capture any remaining holdouts.

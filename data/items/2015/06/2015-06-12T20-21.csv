Heck, auto assembly lines and such have had advanced robotics for several decades already. A whole-sale transition to a post-worker economy is definitely not just-around-the-corner.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;is the technology there&quot;.  It&#x27;s a balancing act between costs.  Is it cheaper to hire people to work these factories, or is it cheaper to dump some R&D money into robotics and then install them?  There&#x27;s also a degree of uncertainty with the robotics, but ultimately workers can be replaced either because robots become cheaper or because workers become more expensive.<p>It&#x27;s really not a rationalization because I don&#x27;t feel it justifies mistreating workers, but it&#x27;s worth keeping in mind that there is a tipping point.  Part of the problem is that you or I or the workers on the line have no idea what that tipping point is, which creates a lot of FUD, which corporations happily exploit.  &quot;Oh, you really don&#x27;t want to ask for benefit Y, that just might make the robots cheaper...&quot;.<p>And as far as people still working 40 hours a week, you&#x27;re right.

McDonalds is already doing some pilots of replacing their in-shop workers with robots, and the cashiers are now just kiosks.

(25M) I&#x27;m currently a first year phd student in the sciences (programming-oriented) at an R1 university, but I&#x27;m leaving at the end of summer because a PhD was not the right track for me. In the meantime, I&#x27;m working on boosting my programming skills, since I have a connection that&#x27;s getting me a foot-in-the-door over at an alexa top 10 website for a junior ML position. Basically, if I go for this, I stand a good chance at getting a position with a base salary of ~70k+<p>That&#x27;s option one.<p>Option two is I pursue a dream Ive had for about a decade to go live in Japan for 1-2 years or so. Probably would start off just teaching English, since I dont think my Japanese is good enough yet for me to be able to compete for jobs I&#x27;m more qualified for.
My current financial situation is pretty much in the shitter, and I have loan payments and bills that make it effectively impossible to save anything.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing though. I&#x27;m young now. and I know that that won&#x27;t last forever. If I go for the career opportunity, yeah, sure I&#x27;ll almost certainly be financially stable, but it will almost certainly also lock me into a particular location for years. And realistically speaking, life will happen, and the chances that I&#x27;ll ever actually pursue the dream of living abroad will diminish greatly. On the other hand, if I go, I most likely will not be very financially stable, but I will be pursuing exactly what I want to do. I already know that I love teaching, since from my PhD program, I&#x27;ve been doing it for a year now, and it&#x27;s literally the best part of my day.<p>So, if I go, I would be liquidating the vast majority of my personal belongings in order to afford the move.

Ideally, by the time you&#x27;re out of the 30 year term for life insurance your investments and assets left to your family will be more than enough to pass on to them.

That&#x27;s a total cost of $18,000 over 30 years for $500,000 in benefits which is an outstanding value.<p>Taking out loans against whole life policies isn&#x27;t something I was aware of though.

This was originally a measure to help families out in dire times of drought to begin with, and is going to be used as such again here. The rent is supposed to reflect the usage of water included, much like garbage or power surcharges negotiated in the lease or rental contract. Additionally, most place will not update the rent yearly as is.<p>It is then obvious that since no-one in SoCal is incentivized to save water by the market on a timely basis, this scheme to have people pay more as they use is not a good way to keep thirst down. If you listen to radio/TV you see a lot of ads trying to get people to use less voluntarily.

9708433,comment,9691002,9695033,0,0,brightball,,,"I see your points here, but these are trickier than you&#x27;re making them out to be.<p>Using the numbers you&#x27;re putting out here, if you put 20% down on a $500,000 home ($100,000 while borrowing $400,000) there&#x27;s a couple of discrepancies.<p>First, paying off the mortgage early. You&#x27;re right, once it&#x27;s paid off you will be earning 0% interest. Assuming you don&#x27;t pay it off early and go with the full 30 year schedule and I&#x27;m going to assume a 4% interest rate here, your total payment price will be about $875,000. By paying off early you&#x27;re eliminating those losses. It&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re earning 0%, it&#x27;s that you&#x27;re not losing over -100%.<p>If your home goes up 10%, regardless of whether it&#x27;s paid off or leverage you actually didn&#x27;t make anything. You don&#x27;t make anything on real estate until you sell it to cash out. Until then, any gains in a home that&#x27;s paid off or mortgaged are identical. The only difference is if you didn&#x27;t put 20% down and were also paying extra for PMI then the increase in value could get you out of PMI.<p>Yes, the money on your loan could have been earning interest. Instead it&#x27;s losing interest so you need to find a guaranteed return higher than your mortgage rate. Guaranteed is the trick there. If you can pull it off with a whole life policy, then great. Without the guarantee market volatility comes into play. If you&#x27;re a person who is comfortable  taking out a loan to invest in something else, your perspective will clearly differ here though.<p>#4 is admittedly a very good an interesting point that I had not considered at all.<p>Regarding the mortgage interest being tax deductible, that only gets you back the equivalent you would have paid in income tax. 80% of it is still full interest.<p>I&#x27;ll definitely look into the videos and whole life policies though. Anytime I talk about putting money into paying off a mortgage early I always have an equity line open on the house so that I can pull most if it back out for emergencies, including making the actual mortgage payments in the event of a lapse in income for some reason.<p>With that, available it makes it easier to avoid the foreclosure because you&#x27;ve got a way to use the equity to avoid default and by yourself time. You just have to open the line of credit when you aren&#x27;t having bad luck.",1434142051

9708430,comment,9706911,9708200,0,0,mrjaeger,,,"Re Re card counting:  The vast, vast majority of advantage when counting is the choice to change your bet size depending on the count.  When a deck starts you are at some initial count and then it goes up or down as the deck goes along.  While the count is at or below a certain point (low counts are considered bad and high counts are considered good), you usually just bet the table minimum as you do not have an advantage over the house.  Once the count reaches a certain level you start betting more aggresively.  There is usually a spread to counts where for example if the count is 1 you bet 2x table minimum if it is 3 you bet 4x table minimum etc.  This is how you take advantage of the fact that the odds are in your favor - if you just bet the same amount all the time you are not really doing anything different (assuming you are following Basic Strategy at all times).<p>The rub here is that this type of betting can be seen by the house.  If you are of enough interest to the casino (something you can get playing $100 hands let along <i>$100K</i> hands) they will watch you bet and try and look for this pattern.  Most casinos employ former counters or have people on staff you can, after a little bit of time, determine if you are counting or not and politely ask you to leave. In fact most counters will specifically give away some of their advantage by going against the recommended bet at a given count to try and make it look less like they are counting.  One such practice would be to never go from a minimum bet to a max bet, as it is most likely not something a regular counter would do (aka bet $100 one hand then bet $1K the next hand).<p>You are correct however that some advantage can be gained by just &quot;tracking whether you&#x27;ve seen a lot of high cards&quot;.  Players use indexes which will change their play depending on the count, and use this skill to augment their changes in betting amounts to better take advantage of their current position.  You can see the effect of using indexes vs. no indexes here: <a href=""https://www.qfit.com/cardcountingindexes.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.qfit.com/cardcountingindexes.htm</a>",1434142009

&quot;Oh no I lost my job&quot; risk is already priced into current market-rate salaries.

I think it&#x27;s also possible Skenazy, who is not an attorney, is confused: there may be civil-looking paperwork required to place the kids in temporary care.<p>* A careful reading of the original story suggests that the kid(s?) may have been locked out longer than 90 minutes; the timespans you have to account for are: the time before the neighbor noticed the kid(s?) out in the rain, the time after that where the kids remain outside unattended until the police arrive, and then the time it took for the police to <i>wait at the house with the kids</i> (which also doesn&#x27;t sound right; why didn&#x27;t they just take the kids to the station?).<p>What we actually know right now:<p>* Somebody set of parents in Florida, who may or may not live in the same place (the single page of court documentation posted lists them separately) had some sort of run-in with juvenile court involve one or more kids.<p>* A lawyer reviewed paperwork not yet released and said that it corroborates the parents story.<p>Of course, the parents could be reporting accurately the actions of the police on that day, but leaving out a bunch of additional context from prior to that day.",1434139896

In my experience, actually doing things this way leads to less economic success for the product and eventually it gets outsold by a competitor without those restraints.

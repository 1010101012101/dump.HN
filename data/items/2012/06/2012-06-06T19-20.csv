4075840,comment,4075155,4075155,22,0,saket123,,,"Finally some great advise. I will like to add my experience to it. When I first started developing on Android (around a year and half ago) I had just a HTC Hero which my employer then (I was interning) bought on CL. I had to share this phone with a fellow developer. Using just that one device we managed to make an app which totally blew away its IOS counterpart . Then one of my friends bought Motorola Atrix . This phone was first phone with such a high resolution (~275 ppi) as far as I can remember with slightly different aspect ratio. When I loaded my app on this phone everything worked perfectly. It was a realization that Android provides so many tools and ways like 9 patch images, different assets folder, layout mechanism which makes handling such differences easy. All you need to do is to get out of single screen mentality (or 2) and think more like a web developer developing for different browsers and screens.<p>My experience so far has been (I have around 40 apps on Android Market) unless OEMs do something stupid or have bugs and  you are not handling some platform bugs (these are rare but can get quite annoying) especially from 2.1 to 2.2 and 2.3 to 4.0, you should be fine.<p>In some instances I had to use jar-jar (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jarjar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/jarjar/</a>) for common libraries like GSON (json parser) since some OEMS (I think it was some phones from HTC) were modifying the implementations and it was resulting in errors in my app.<p>Lets talk about look and feel. Android has a very vibrant open spurce community. If you want to follow design guidelines (<a href=""http://developer.android.com/design/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/design/index.html</a>) (you should, even though you are not needed to) , just use open source libraries like action bar sherlock , android theme generator and you can achieve 95% identical look and feel between 2.3 and 4.0. You can always grab the holo theme assets from Android 4.0 source (which is shipped with SDK) and create your own  holo theme (if you are using holo for Android 4.0).<p>Lastly, you can always use support library to get fragment functionality. Fragments are most important defragmentation tool.  Some other niceties like Loader manager are also part of support package.<p>Enjoy developing on Android!",1339012481

4075838,comment,4073162,4075033,5,0,ethereal,,,"zsh used to do this for me (back when I used it; switched back to bash about a year ago now), and it was the most _annoying_ thing it ever did. My typical workflow (when working on a software project) involves a pair of terminals for compiling and execution, an editor window (whether gvim or kate/kile/kdevelop etc.), and a documentation terminal for manpages.<p>Oftentimes my execution lines are somewhat long -- enabling/disable debugging info in certain sections of the program while tracing programs, etc, and I'd not want to type them out continuously. As a result I'd use the command history a lot, muscle memory would automatically hit CTRL-P once I switched to one of my execution terminals. If I'd visited something in the documentation terminal in the meantime, I'd be staring at 'man 2 timer_create' instead of my expected './aesalon --set listen=6421 --set ::debug-shm --set ::debug-interaction'. The third-second or so I'd need to do a sanity check would seriously interrupt my train of thought.<p>It's neat, and I can see why people like it. But for my particular one use-case of terminals/shells, it was annoying. Took me about a week before I realized just how much it was slowing me down and disabled it.<p>[I probably should have just set up another zsh configuration for those particular terminals, but enough years with bash have trained me, I guess, to not expect it from my shell.]",1339012442

4075611,comment,4075025,4075359,2,0,lsc,,,"I think ec2 is the counterexample here.   EC2 costs vastly more than owning hardware, and is in many ways harder (you have to design your application to be able to lose any server /much/ earlier than you do with hardware backed by a good SysAdmin's pager,)  but from what I've seen working at large corporations, it's far easier (and to further contradict what I said earlier, cheaper)  than running those servers in-house, at least for companies that aren't very IT focused.  It's also vastly faster;  as soon as the budget is approved and you have a guy trained on bringing up ec2 stuff, bang, you have your hardware, whereas in many companies, you ask IT and it's a long back and forth while IT tries to ""help"" you figure out what you really want, then it's another week while they get the hardware, then it's not just what you wanted, so there's another back and forth of a week.  If the hardware was of a new type, there's another week while weirdness due to the new hardware are worked out.  During all this time, the manager that wanted the servers can't do anything but whine to IT.  With ec2, that manager can just get a better ec2 sysadmin and get on with it.<p>Therefore, many big company managers just head to amazon for their hardware rather than to the IT department.   Part of the efficiency of ec2 is that you don't have to go through some salesrep and spend weeks going back and forth on price like you do when you buy pre-built servers (or way worse, data centre space or bandwidth.)  There is no ""vendor relationship"" to manage, and ""vendor relationships"" add rather a lot of hidden costs on both sides.<p>My point is just that if you can solve the problem in a way that managers can plausibly justify an end-run around existing obstacles?  I mean, you do need hype, and name recognition, but you can do it without a whole lot of high touch sales and ""customer relationships.""",1339010112

4075602,comment,4071864,4072357,1,0,scrumper,,,"> I won't pay $100+/month<p>I know you were talking about a direct service but this argument affects HBO's current cable delivery model too.<p>I am a cable cutter. I made the decision two years ago after realising that the only shows I watched through my TWC/Tivo subscription were on HBO. I enjoyed them a lot, just not enough to justify spending $112 a month on the TV portion of the service. Worse, I only really watched HBO originals (the movie selection is slow to rotate and doesn't even begin to compare to Netflix). I'd get perhaps 40 hours a <i>year</i> of viewing from HBO (two originals, at most), which makes the net cost per hour viewed over $30. That's twice the rate of going to the cinema, never mind all the other stuff I could do in front of a TV with my time for far less (like gaming: $50 for 100 hours of Elder Scrolls, anyone?)<p>I ended up in this situation because I already had instant, on-demand, (mostly) ad-free access to an enormous range of current and classic TV through Netflix, Hulu, iTunes and miscellaneous network websites. I was deriving absolutely no utility from my cable subscription other than HBO. That suddenly made HBO seem inordinately expensive. It was a simple economic decision to ditch Tivo and TWC, buy a Mac Mini and a decent remote and stream everything. My bill went from $180 (including internet and streaming services) to $70 and the hardware paid for itself in under a year. (Were I a sports fan I'd be in a very different position, as no doubt I'd view $112 a month as worth it for access to live sports on ESPN.)<p>I pirate nothing. I miss out on none of these phantom 'water cooler conversations' people talk about. I learned patience. I have more money. It's been a good decision.<p>I said this had implications for HBO; I am sure I am not alone in my pre-cutter profile (streaming a fair bit, not watching much cable TV, enjoying some HBO originals) and I'm not the only one who's figured out that HBO-over-cable's cost per hour viewed makes it one of the most expensive forms of entertainment available. I don't believe HBO can compete under their current model in the long term.",1339010070

Once I was reading an article on copyright and using CC licensed material. It was a well written piece, yet image at the top was violating CC license(!). It was a crop from 'no-derivatives' licensed image. How come? I tried to push a kind comment raising the issue. You guessed it, it didnt come through.<p>If I ever try to use a copyrighted image which is not directly for sale ('Its so lovely, its the only option'), I'll usually email the person. It ends with two or three warm emails and best wishes. Is it that hard? Sure not a way to go for TNW (choosing CC is faster and problem free for them).<p>Using CC'd stuff I will often find myself finding how a person would prefer to be attributed.

I am perfectly fine with them making this business decision.

Currently, there are no good tablets in the enterprise market that allow users both to read and edit documents. Windows 8 gives tablet users access to programs like Excel and PowerPoint with exactly the same level of functionality as they would on a full-fledged desktop PC. This could be a godsend for knowledge workers whose tasks really only require the computing power of a tablet, letting them forgo purchasing a more pricey laptop or desktop.<p>Also, promoting Javascript and HTML5 as first-class citizens in the Windows 8 environment opens the door to native app development for a massive population of web developers, which is a huge event in software engineering. Web devs will be able to create the same kinds of dynamic UIs with web connectivity as they always have but with the added bonus of file system, GPU, and other kinds of OS access. As a web dev, I'm stoked.<p>Yes, Microsoft is heavily favoring touch interaction at the expense of the mouse and keyboard interface.

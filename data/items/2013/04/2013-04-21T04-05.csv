5583918,comment,5581614,5581614,1,0,dottrap,,,"Typical, but sad myopic thinking that one language should do every possible thing well.<p>For example, Unix tools were designed to be good for one single task and then strung together using pipes. Each tool is left to decide how to be implemented in the best way possible instead of being centrally imposed. This could be C, Lisp, Bash, Perl, Python. In the end, it doesn't really matter which language each specific tool chose; it only matters that they work.<p>Another example, the typical video game on your iPhone is written in multiple languages: C, C++, Objective-C, Lua. The build process may include some shell scripts. And if there is a server component, that may have been written in Ruby, Perl, Python, PHP, C, C++, Go, etc.",1366520370

FWIW they're all very close right now, and the biggest surprise is that Houston is so diverse--it has undergone the most rapid transformation of any large city in America in the last 3 decades, which means it's on track for rapidly outpacing the others in ethnic diversity (there were few Hispanics and Asians here when I was born, and now there are huge numbers).",1366520320

I think he's rather talking about cloud services that automate some of of your task where he proposes to actually add <i>more</i> steps / buttons / messages in the middle that help the user understand what's going on. To quote the article:<p>> Put your user in the middle of your flow. Make them press an extra button, make them provide some inputs, let them be part of the service-providing, rather than a bystander to it. If they are part of the flow, they have a better vantage point to see whats going on. Automation is great, but its a layer of cognitive complexity that should be used carefully. (Bump puts the user in the middle of the flow quite physically. While there were other ways to build a scalable solution without the physical bump, its very effective for helping people internalize exactly whats going on.)",1366519399

Whatever interface you are designing, the underlying service you are building the interface for <i>has</i> to be something people <i>really, really</i> want.<p>The most cognitively recognizable interface won't get people using something if they don't care about the information coming from the other side. Conversely, if there is information that the end user needs, he will spend the time learning the interface. For example, if Shazam didn't exist and you heard a song you really liked at the bar, you might ask around, google some fragment of the lyrics you recognize, etc. to find out the same information. So if Shazam had an interface that was far less-intuitive, I have to believe it would still be very popular.<p>That sounds simple, but I think the article puts the weight on the interface without much regard to the fact that all interfaces are merely a means to an end.",1366519252

5583833,comment,5582707,5583555,5,0,mdasen,,,"So, you're right that no one knows something like that.  However, I think that Apple and Google (to use two specific companies) have very different approaches to gaining their profits.  Apple tries to roll out higher-margin devices and get you to part with your dollars to buy it.  Google, on the other hand, tries to roll out free things and get advertisers to part with their advertising dollars, serving you up as the product.  That sounds a little more anti-ad than I mean it to, but I think it illustrates the ""if you aren't paying, you're the product"" point.  There's nothing wrong with being the product if you get something awesome in return.  Gmail is awesome and free.<p>However, once you're scanning emails for targeting an ad specific to the email, why not try to build a profile of a person?  Why not try to figure out as much as you can to target them?  With a mobile device, why not track their location (linked to an account) so you can tell where they are usually going?  Build their voice queries into that profile?  Now when they walk to a certain area and it's tuesday near lunch, maybe you know what restaurant they like and serve an ad for a competitor.<p>Again, some of this is hyperbole to illustrate a point and I'm not accusing Google of anything.  But Google makes its money off of being able to sell ads that are relevant to you.  They try to keep it to a non-creepy level, but it's their profit engine.  Apple, on the other hand, makes their money off you from getting you to part with your dollars in exchange for one of their shiny toys.  In fact, when you look at Apple's revenues, only 3% come from sources other than the iPhone, iPad, iTunes, iPod, and computers.  Unless Apple wants to dramatically change course, the data is much more likely to be used for improvement of the system rather than targeting of individual users.<p>That doesn't ensure that your data will be used in any fashion by any company.  But I think Apple's revenue streams show that, at least right now, they aren't heavily into any area where targeting you via these recordings would be useful for them.  In fact, if anything it would jeopardize their already highly-profitable operations and that would make it a hard decision to exploit it.",1366517958

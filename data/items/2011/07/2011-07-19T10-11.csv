In my opinion people don't feel this way (I certainly never did and grew up glued to my TV) and would have spent their time better in other activities rather than following hours of reality TV shows etc.<p>Doing ""whatever you like"" doesn't necessarily enrich your life. It's just immediate pleasure. Sometimes doing whatever is BEST for you (which you should of course decide) is way more important. If people really sat down and thought about it, a lot of them would realise that, as much as they like it, TV is NOT best for them.",1311073128

And I'm not just talking about people who are starving or homeless.

2780227,comment,2777883,2777883,1,0,sharjeel,,,"I worked for four years in my startup in which we decided to go with django; four years ago RoR (v1.2.3) and django(0.97) were almost at par. Even though RoR had a slightly bigger community, django was clearly emerging as a leader. Both were equally good but we went for django because it had better performance, the explicit style seemed better than the inflexible conventions approach, Python's one-clear-way-of-solving syntax seemed better suited for teams and django's performance was certainly better than RoR.<p>Fast-forwarding four years and coming to 2011 with django 1.3 and Rails 3.0: I happened to work in another team to build a product in RoR from scrach. I was blown away by what Rails community has achieved while django is lagging behind a lot and is least likely to catch up.<p>Here are a few highlights:<p>* As a generic statement, to achieve anything in RoR, usually there is one clear and simple way of doing it. On the other hand in django you can do in many ways and most of the programmers have their own preferable ways. This is ironic considering Python endorses the very same principle but Ruby has a flexible syntax to cater different styles.<p>* In RoR, you can find a gem for almost anything. Plugging gem in your app is usually extremely simple. On the other, comparatively there are very few usable django apps and integrating them in your django project usually turns out to be painful. 
* Resolving and maintaining gem dependencies across the team is a piece of cake with bundler. However when it comes to django, I couldn't find a good tool. There is virtualenv but I couldn't find it comparable with the power of bundler.<p>* Deployment is fun in Rails. In django, it was and still is painful.<p>* Rails has a far better support for Backend databases, including some support for NoSQL. On the other hand it was just a while back django started supporing multiple databases and that too is hackish approach.<p>* Databases migrations in Rails are straightforward and explicity. django doesn't have anything like that builtin but does have a django-evolution app which can be really troublesome in some cases.<p>* Django's restrictive templating system theoretically lets you not shoot yourself in the foot by imposing a new language. But having to learn a new language and dealing with its quirks sometimes makes you pull your hair. Rails approach of embedding Ruby in templates is much more powerful and practically useful. Sure you can override templating systems in both frameworks but defaults are the ones almost everyone uses.<p>* There are very few hosting services specifically tailored for django. But Rails community boasts services such as heroku which save you so much time that a django fanatic cannot understand.<p>* I haven't seen testing in Rails in depth but from the bird's eyeview, automated test-cases in Rails seem much more powerful than in django. I might be wrong here.<p>* Rails has much better documentation and a much stronger community. Compare the Rails and django books on Amazon, questions asked on SO, blogs, tweets, everywhere Rails now dominates.<p>Its just that I really love Python and prefer it much more over Ruby. Even then I'll probably completely switch to Rails.",1311070584

Some of the items, particularly the NAS (NSS 300 series), have been very disappointing.<p>More disappointing, though, is that there seems to be no simple way to get meaningful support or contribute feedback afterwards. Half the canonical links on their web site don't even work. They seem to have a whole bunch of forums scattered around the site, but it looks like you can only participate after jumping through all kinds of hoops that we just don't have time for.<p>You can't even download documentation on how essential features work. Obvious example: If we're using encryption on our NAS, how does the key system work and do we need to keep a back-up copy of anything like that in case one of the disks in the RAID array fails? More subtle example: If there is this great integration with Mozy to deal with off-site back-ups automatically, why can't I even find out the prices and do basic due diligence about data security before I sign up for the service, and why did the Mozy call centre staff apparently not even know about the deal and the Mozy sales e-mail address not even reply to a basic enquiry? Is there even anyone at Cisco we can talk to about this?<p>Given that the only other reason to buy the Cisco version of the NAS rather than the original model from QNAP seems to be the Cisco 5-year ""support"", and the QNAP has had all sorts of enhancements and new functionality rolled out in the intervening period while Cisco have done squat, it's all one-way traffic in our office, and it's away from Cisco.<p>So I'm not surprised they're tightening up.

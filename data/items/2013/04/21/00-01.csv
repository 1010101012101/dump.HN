You write the legislation now and you risk things like nation-wide lock-in to IE6. Software takes time, and the Web's immature. Right now, it's very noisy, it's not private, it's socially chaotic, and it's not quite secure enough - online elections, anybody?<p>That said, the things that IT touches tend to become more open in the long run, and eventually that'll include Congress.

This is how the entire VC industry in SV works, and it definitely still applies even if you want to make a profit-first company, it just applies to a sightly lesser degree (usually for VCs in SV, one company in their entire portfolio will need to deliver 50x+ return).

5583347,comment,5578642,5581806,2,0,hatcravat,,,"No.  This is wrong.  First, sampling need not imply quantization[1].  Second, the signal to noise ratio of the continuous signal source is important.  With sufficiently many bits and sufficiently many samples, you can <i>exactly</i> reproduce any band-limited continuous signal above the noise floor[2].  Those last four words are important.  Analog data never comes without noise, and a ""sufficient number of bits"" is nowhere near as high as you think (particularly with noise-shaping techniques like dithering).<p>Now, it is the case, as user rayiner mentioned, that there can be advantages to using more than the required number of bits and samples (though not quite for the reasons he mentioned). For starters, you do need an anti-aliasing filter between the signal source and your ADC.  Increasing the sample rate reduces the complexity of the AA filter, and digital-domain math can make up for it (and increase the effective number of bits, to boot!).  But when you go to reproduce the signal, there's no good reason to use more samples and bits than necessary. That was the whole point of the ""Niel Young paper"" that has been linked to so many times.<p>Vinyl does not come close to the limits of consumer-grade recording devices (except maaaaaybe in certain bands, but that can be dealt with by using noise-shaping techniques).  Does that make those who like the sound of vinyl bad people?  No.  Just like those who enjoy sitting in front of a wood fireplace are not bad people.  Gas fireplaces have a lot of advantages, but some people like the crackling of the wood and the smell it produces.<p>[1] Tektronix made a very nice set of (<i>entirely</i> analog) sampling oscilloscopes in the 1960's which used sampling techniques to measure high frequency signals (on the order of 1GHz when contemporary continuous-signal CROs could barely reach 100MHz).  These oscilloscopes displayed discrete-time, continuous-amplitude signals, and deliberately excluded the anti-aliasing filter I mentioned above (though it wasn't true heterodyning as most RF people would think of it, because samples were taken based a delay from a trigger recognizer, and thus not <i>necessarily</i> equally spaced in time).<p>[2] Signals below the noise floor are outside the scope of this discussion and usually require some form of synchronous detection (like a lock-in amplifier) or frequency-spreading / -despreading (like GPS).",1366504099

5583313,comment,5582803,5582803,2,0,memracom,,,"The problem is people being satisfied with a free application for doing mission critical calculations. Yes, you buy an MS Office licence and Excel comes free. That is fine for run of the mill everyday calculations, but it is not OK for mission critical work and it is NOT ok for the CFO or anyone who advises the CFO on his decisions. Those important financial people should use a spreadsheet like this  <a href=""http://www.resolversystems.com/products/resolver-one/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.resolversystems.com/products/resolver-one/</a> backed up by a team of software developers who write unit tests for the spreadsheets and validate the calculations.<p>TLDR is that the ResolverONE spreadsheet writes Python code as you manipulate the spreadsheet. A software developer can then organize that Python code, write unit tests for the code and validate that the calculations do what the CFO intended. Once this extra work is done, then the business can have confidence in the results of the calculations. But the user interface, i.e. the spreadsheet that end users see, is the same as it was originally.<p>This allows mission critical software development discipline to be applied to the development of spreadsheets. I suspect that the existence of a tool like ResolverONE is one of the factors that led the SEC in the USA to require Python source code for new derivatives that are created, so that there is a standard way to express the calculations of the derivative.",1366503214

A stream of Facebook comments is very difficult to derive ROI from.  If I were to pivot, and had to keep the overall theme of ecommerce + social + facebook, I would build a set of plugins with <i>specific use-cases</i> that work with my store and facebook.  For example:<p>1) a plugin that allows a user to create a ""shopping list"" on facebook from the products in my store.  Make it fun, like a game - perhaps I set myself a budget on facebook and then my friends can vote up or down on the things in my wishlist that they think I should get.<p>2) a plugin that facilitates a ""buy me this"" feature.  A user picks a product on my store and can send it to their boyfriend / girlfriend / mum / dad on facebook (maybe with a nicely formatted letter-style message) asking them to buy it for me. Maybe the purchase is incentivised somehow, with a discount if you get someone to buy it for you.<p>Make a set of these types of plugins, then I think you have a business.

A book that takes hours to consume can be downloaded in minutes. Furthermore, we're already seeing torrent files of hundreds of DRM-free best sellers, making it easy to download first, decide later.<p>In the short term, the best solution seems to make the official process more convenient than pirating (Amazon does this quite well). In the long term, the best solution will probably be to combine the convenience with a subscription model. Lending books becomes a non-issue if all your friends have a $10/month subscription to Amazon's entire catalogue.",1285682950

1735702,comment,1734936,1735455,0,0,halostatue,,,"It's not ""so what,"" and what RubyGems does really matters for version management within an application.<p>If I have one application that depends on version 1.3 of a library, it can do:<p><pre><code>  gem 'library', '~>1.3' # 1.3 and higher, but not less than 1.4\n  require 'library/file'\n</code></pre>\nThe next application that requires 1.5 or later can do:<p><pre><code>  gem 'library', '~>1.5' # 1.5 and higher, but not less than 1.6\n  require 'library/file'\n</code></pre>\nThere's two things here: Debian typically won't include two versions like that; they might include library1 and library2, but not 1.3 and 1.5. Second, I only have to have the 'gem' method in one location; everywhere else I can just do ""require 'library/file'"". I don't have to go through my source to change ""require 'library-1.3/file'"" to ""require 'library-1.5/file'"" when I want to upgrade.<p>The Debian approach works...fairly well for compiled applications, but it's utter crap for dynamic languages like Ruby. The RubyGems approach is <i>superior</i> for Ruby, and it fills a very important need for Ruby: it works on platforms other than Debian.<p>Debian packagers assume that they're the only packager in the world that matters. They're not, and other vendors have done infinitely better jobs of handling packaging Ruby than Debian, mostly because other vendors actually write patches for the upstream providers instead of bitching that the system isn't compatible. (See what Apple did for RubyGems. It still required work on the RubyGems side, but it was at least <i>usable</i> and didn't break the fundamental behaviour of RubyGems.)<p>If Debian packagers want more respect from upstream developers, they need to stop treating us like we're the ones doing something wrong. If we've developed something, it's because there's something missing.",1285682786

Saying that music/lyrics has no market value is just as stupid as saying that just because I personally don&#x27;t want to pay for a Mercedes Benz means it has no value, and I can take one freely.<p>Clearly SOME people are willing to pay for the right to use lyrics, ie. singers, record labels, etc.  Just because a single individual, ex. rapgenius, doesn&#x27;t want to pay for the music/lyrics, which they legally are obliged to do, doesn&#x27;t mean that music/lyrics have no market value.  There is a market value which has been established, and which people pay for.  It just means that if they don&#x27;t pay for the lyrics, they are stealing it.",1388001571

However I would like you think the following before choosing your arsenal(MV* framework):<p>1. It should be easy to understand.\n2. It should have good community support(because you will run into errors and problems).<p>A lot of these frameworks have become very mature with the time and community effort so you will never be alone and stuck at a place with no clue. Start with a framework whose workflow is easy for you to understand, remember the goal here is to organize your javascript code into manageable bits.

6964042,comment,6963263,6963263,2,0,danso,,,"This has been a cool resource, but its comparisons of tasks  can be profoundly misleading to novices...not intentionally, just because novices don&#x27;t know how to really judge things. Take, for example, its section on Web scraping:<p><a href=\"http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Web_scraping\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Web_scraping</a><p>First of all, web scraping is a complex task. Not just at the low-level code, but conceptually...web scraping means different things to different people and this shows up quite frequently even in HN discussions.<p>In any case, the Rosetta example does kind of the right thing by limiting it to a very simple operation...but even the operation itself is misleading (parsing HTML with regexes?). And even in this idealized operation, you have very different opinions on what it entails. The Ruby one looks correct to me,  and it looks very concise compared to other languages, but only because, unlike the CoffeeScript example, there is no error handling.<p>The real problem is that when you&#x27;re a beginner, you have no concept of how programming is best done in small steps...Web scraping is simply a chaining of much smaller steps, such as string manipulation, parsing, options setting, etc. It&#x27;s not a &quot;feature&quot; of a language, yet if you were to make a judgment on Rosetta (and who else but a beginner would really use Rosetta to compare languages by webscraping), you&#x27;re going to have an unhelpful perception of programming languages and programming in general.<p>That said, it&#x27;s a great resource when the task is low-level and well-defined. But what that actually means obviously differs for people and languages. Hence, opinionated frameworks and the like",1388001443

In Julia functions are first class objects and can dispatch on subtypes of Function. There are several immutable types available. There seems to be a convention (at least within the standard library) of adding ! postfix to indicate function as having side effects. You have projects like JUMP (<a href=\"https://jump.readthedocs.org/en/latest/jump.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jump.readthedocs.org/en/latest/jump.html</a>), which explicit revolve around declarative programming DSLs.

In this case the buyer is the website and they have to pay the price since they are using the product openly and publicly.<p>>No they don&#x27;t; they got paid to write the song, they&#x27;re done. The notion that a person deserves to be paid forever in secondary markets where people trade their creations is a perverse and absurd notion that exists only in the messed up modern world; it&#x27;s wrong.<p>Who is this magically being that pays the writer to write the song exactly?  It isn&#x27;t a secondary market it&#x27;s a primary market.  The song writer has created something(A song!) and the site wants to use that song.  They are dealing with the song writer or copyright holder that is a first sale.<p>That person deserves to be paid for what they have created which is what this is.  Your job wouldn&#x27;t exist without that belief and neither would mine.",1387998030

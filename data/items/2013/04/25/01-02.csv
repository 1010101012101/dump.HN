5605355,comment,5603646,5605316,1,0,rayiner,,,"His crime was not writing a program in 10 hours. His crime was, as the jury convicted him of it, writing a program for someone he had a lot of reason to suspect was a criminal, knowing that he intended to use it for criminal purposes. I think after all that, and after failing to cooperate with police even after he became aware of the full extent of the crimes he aided,* I think two years in low-security prison is not an unduly harsh sentence.<p>If it was just the program, it would be a whole separate matter. But as much as the article wants you to think that, if you read the whole second page, you can see that the evidence the jury had in front of them painted a different picture.<p>As for being punished for the rest of his life--the government didn't do that. The government punished him for two years, for aiding in a crime that resulted in tens of millions of dollars in fraud. The fact that people don't want a guy like that working for them after serving his time is somewhat unfair, but also pretty understandable.<p>*) The article makes ""not snitching on your friends"" out to be some noble thing, but it's not and that's not how civilized societies work.

5605341,comment,5603190,5603774,1,0,Gormo,,,"> The author is saying that MOOCs don't offer the level of sociability that brick-and-mortar classes do.<p>Of course, this remains an invalid claim for entirely different reasons, unless you interpret it as admitting that the ""level"" of sociability of MOOCs is often <i>higher</i> than a bricks-and-mortar class.<p>I recently completed an online master's program, offered by a traditional university, but in the MOOC format, with lectures in podcast format, and collaboration primarily via message boards, chat sessions similar to IRC, and email.  There were conference calls as well, but the bulk of actual academic collaboration took place via text media.  In-person meetings only occurred for one weekend in each semester.<p>As I perceived it, the depth and sophistication of interaction and collaboration among students was significantly higher here than in any bricks-and-mortar course I've ever taken.  I attribute this to the asynchronicity of communication (it's pretty hard to get a large group of people together at the same time and all in the mental state conducive to productive discourse) and to the fact that people just communicate <i>better</i> in writing than in verbal speech (assuming they can write effectively, at least; if so, it's much easier to convey complex inter-related ideas in a paragraph or two of text than it is to attempt to verbalize them in real-time).<p>Quite like the comparing the experience of having a discussion on HN to discussing the same topic face-to-face with others, in fact.<p>OTOH, if ""sociability"" refers to merely recreational activity like grabbing a beer after a lecture, then yeah, bricks-and-mortar wins.  But what's that got to do with school?  If I want to socialize for the sake of socializing, I can go out for a beer with my local friends instead of my classmates.",1366854936

Diversity creates an atmosphere that will most likely mirror the world in which these future leaders will be required to navigate. That in itself is enough of a justification for diversity, assuming their goal is to educate future leaders. Also, there is the fact that leaders of ethnic groups tend to be of that ethnic group, so maximizing some proportion of diversity is increasing that schools chance of educating a future leader.",1366854812

It will be selectively chosen and spun to advance their core idea that domestic/union laborers need constant government rescue, via things like immigration restrictions. (Of course data selected by think tanks with other ideologies deserves skeptical reading, as well.)<p>As was pointed out last time the EPI scored a press hit with their claim of stagnant IT wages (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4880332"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4880332</a>), they appear to be leaving out the very real possibility a younger/earlier-career mix of workers -- a demographic bulge -- makes their broad wage averages look worse, even while each individual cohort is better off.<p>And, when in this latest study they highlight how many college graduates who fill IT positions have non-IT degrees (Figure F: 38%+), or of all IT workers have no degree at all (36%, p. 8), they should realize that one way to deal with a skills shortage is to make-do with less-skilled/less-trained people, <i>but then pay them less</i> while they learn or simply play-out-of-position. (This making-do also creates the early-in-career demographic bulge mentioned above.)<p>On the other hand, when the EPI looks at the fact many STEM majors don't wind up working in STEM jobs (Figure D), it is spun as: ""For every two students that U.S. colleges graduate with STEM degrees, only one is hired into a STEM job."" From that wording you'd think the streets are filled with woeful idle STEM graduates! But maybe, given the still very low unemployment among all with college degrees (and especially technical degrees), these graduates found something else they preferred? Or maybe they really weren't very good at or happy with their exact STEM degree area?<p>It requires the EPI's factory-floor mindset, where STEM degree recipients are cogs that could (or should) be dropped into closely-matching STEM jobs, to make this natural dynamism sound like we might have way more idle STEM graduates than we can use.",1366854021

Douthat seizes on one relatively minor finding in the entire book to push an interpretation that goes far beyond the bounds of the actual evidence.<p>We find that applicants who demonstrate a strong commitment to career-oriented extracurricular activities while in high school have a slightly lower chance of being admitted to a top school.  This outcome affects only students who have won awards or assumed leadership positions in these activities, not those known for their extensive involvement.  These extracurriculars might include 4-H clubs or Future Famers of America, as Douthat mentions, but they could also include junior ROTC, co-op work programs, and many other types of career-oriented endeavors.  Participating in these activities does not necessarily mean that applicants come from rural backgrounds.  The weak negative association with admission chances could just as well suggest that these students are somewhat ambivalent about their academic futures.<p>... students who apply from Red states appear to have an advantage in the process.  Compared to otherwise similar applicants from California, those from Utah are 45 times as likely to be admitted to one of our elite colleges or universities.  The advantage for applicants from West Virginia or Montana is 25 times greater, and nearly 10 times greater for students from Alabama.  Because top private schools seek geographic diversity, and students from Americas vast middle are less likely to apply, it stands to reason that their admission chances are higher.  On the other hand, coming from such Blue states as Virginia or Colorado lowers the odds of admission.</i>",1366853565

And the fundamental design of apache as well as the design of its configuration system is optimized for that. And though it's been modified extensively to do everything a modern web server needs to do in many ways it's still held back by that heritage. Also, apache is fairly monolithic. The way to add functionality to apache is generally with modules, for example, and generally a random apache installation is going to have vastly more features active than you may actually need, or want. All of which affects performance.<p>Nginx was written from the ground up in the modern web era, when we had already learned about the common ways that real websites worked (dynamic, high throughput, tied into other technology like php or rails, possibly living on multiple servers, etc.) Nginx is designed for efficiency and low overhead. It's also designed to live within an ecosystem rather than live as the container of an ecosystem, at its heart it's not a web-server it's a proxy. And all of this makes nginx easier to set up, easier to configure, and generally more efficient with superior performance compared to apache.<p>Here's an example. I have a server set up with a couple different sites, some of them are fronted by varnish (for caching), several run on php, and another runs on rails. With nginx this is all fairly easy to do. Instead of installing modules as you would tend to do with apache you set up php and rails as standalone socket-based servers (e.g. php-fpm and unicorn) and then in your nginx configuration you simply tell the web server where those are and how to use them.<p>Nginx also funnels you into a pattern which makes it easier to scale. Because nginx is just part of an ecosystem and not the container of an ecosystem you can easily migrate components to other servers as necessary. In my example I could push varnish off to another server, push each php app off onto its own server, push rails off onto separate servers, etc. The configuration changes would be fairly minimal and it would all still just work.",1366852643

I believe the terms go something like:<p><i>""Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.""</i><p>If you just have a general commitment that you're not going to turn something over if under duress, does that count? And, if you can't do it and actually are guilty, is obstruction going to get you a lesser penalty anyway?<p>I imagine this is why encryption doesn't count as obstruction, since you have a general commitment that your stuff be difficult to read by anyone, rather than a specific grudge with the police.<p>By way of mitigating your risk, you might even be able to tell the police, in recorded interview, that you needed access to a computer in the next - whatever time period - to preserve the evidence that will prove your innocence.

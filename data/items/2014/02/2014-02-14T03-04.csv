I still don&#x27;t get what a civilization without a &quot;monopoly on laws and law enforcement&quot; would look like.<p>Not a libertarian here, but one example regarding this might be medieval Iceland where such shopping around was encouraged and even the basis of the system, as was taking things into one&#x27;s own hands and perpetrating blood feuds.<p>Interestingly the difference between &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;manslaughter&quot; in Iceland had nothing to do with intent but rather that if you killed someone that was manslaughter, but if you failed to report it to the family of the victim properly in a timely manner, or you tried to hide the fact, then it was murder (and a far, far more serious crime).<p>But then I suspect there&#x27;s a reason why at that time, Iceland didn&#x27;t have cities.",1392350388

After all the limits of what a contract may cover is a social, and therefore political decision, right?<p>As a Distributist, I see Libertarians as seeing a real problem and coming up with a weird solution to it.  The problem is not to reduce the subject-matter scope of government (I actually think this should be expanded slightly to include running of infrastructure that is physical-monopoly territory provided that services are not provided by the government), but to reduce the geographic and demographic scale of government entities.  I.e. rather than move government into the &quot;private sector&quot; (which becomes an empty formalism), bring government back close to the people.

7236774,comment,7232042,7233130,6,0,tzs,,,"> It means that you agree that all disputes will be settled in NY<p>It means that they will be settled <i>using</i> NY law, not that they will be settled <i>in</i> NY. An example might make things clearer.<p>Suppose a party in the UK enters into a contract with a party in Germany. The contract has a clause that says either party can terminate the contract provided they provide 30 days written notification to the other party. Failure to provide adequate notification can result in some losses for the other party, and so could lead to litigation. The contract has a clause that says it will be governed by the laws of New York State.<p>The German party wants to cancel the contract, and does so by sending an email to the UK party 31 days before their proposed termination date. The UK party does not see the email for several days, and incurs some losses. They sue the German party in German court. Let&#x27;s assume that the German party conducts business throughout the world, and so the plaintiff has many choices as to where to sue (they can basically sue anywhere that has personal jurisdiction over the German party).<p>The key issue is whether or not the German party provided 30 days written notification. Is email &quot;written notification&quot;, or does it have to be a more traditional form of written communication, such as postal mail or telegram? Also, 30 days from whose point of view? Does the sender merely have to send the notification 30 days or more before the propose termination date, or does the receiver have to receive it 30 days or more before that date?<p>Different jurisdictions might have different answers to these questions. If the contract does not define what constitutes 30 days written notification, the outcome can depend on where the plaintiff sues.<p>What the German court will do is look at their choice of law rules. Those rules will tell them what jurisdiction&#x27;s contract law to apply when interpreting a contract between a UK party and a German party, and then use that jurisdiction&#x27;s contract law to figure out what constitutes 30 days written notification. One of Germany&#x27;s choice of law rules says that if the contract explicitly says what jurisdiction&#x27;s rules to use, the German court will honor that.<p>Thus, the German court will try to figure out how New York contract law interprets &quot;30 days written notification&quot;. If New York allows email notification, and if the 30 days is from the sender&#x27;s viewpoint or the recipient&#x27;s viewpoint.<p>This is one of the things that makes a judge&#x27;s job interesting--just because you sit on the bench in Germany doesn&#x27;t mean you only get to deal with German law. It gets especially interesting if you are trying to apply foreign law to an issue that has not been considered in the foreign jurisdiction. This would happen in this example if New York law had nothing to say about what &quot;30 days written notification&quot; should mean. The German could would then have to try to infer the principles behind New York contract law, and decide what they think would happen if the issue arose in New York.<p>It is important to note that the German court will NOT use New York law for things not related to contract interpretation. It will use German law for rules of procedure, rules of evidence, qualification of expert witnesses, and things like that.<p>A completely different thing is a choice of venue clause, although they are often confused with choice of law clauses. A choice of venue clause would say that the parties agree that any litigation over the contract will be brought in New York courts, and that the parties concede that the New York court has personal jurisdiction. You should always be careful if you see a choice of venue clause in a contract, especially if it is a foreign venue for you.<p>Choice of law clauses are generally pretty safe. They are essentially just shortcuts saving a lot of verbiage in the contract, so that both parties can know what any terms, like &quot;30 day written notice&quot;, actually mean.",1392349765

Maybe 5% of code the evaluation strategy matters.  It makes no difference whether you are adding strictness for 2% of your code or adding laziness for 2% of your code.<p>The performance question I think is a misconception.  Do you have any evidence to suggest it is easier to write fast code in ocaml?  I&#x27;ve never found a person who has used both languages and felt that was the case.  I&#x27;ve only found people without haskell experience believing that via second (or third, or fiftieth) hand rumors.<p>Ocaml offers two things over haskell.  One, imperative constructs.  This matters for people making a transition to functional programming, but not for people who&#x27;ve finished that transition.  Second, the compiler is fast.  I don&#x27;t mean generates fast code, ghc does that too.  I mean it generates code quickly.  This is an annoyance with ghc, no question.<p>Haskell offers a lot over ocaml.  A useful standard library.  Cabal and hackage.  Parallelism done right, out of the box (super cheap green threads multiplexed over a pool of OS threads).  Tons of libraries that don&#x27;t exist in ocaml, everywhere from attoparsec and aeson, to binary and lenses, pipes-concurrency and STM.

(See: my note about dividing the 1000 richest people artificially into &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; teams and putting them into war.) Without it, the world seems to be run by yes-men and visionless cost cutters (do the same damn mediocre thing with less resources) than people with the leadership and creativity to actually advance the world.<p>It seems to be a pretty dismal fact of humanity that the only thing that prevents social cancer (i.e. the emergence of a parasitic, non-producing, and aggressively self-enriching elite that causes increasing dysfunction in the society, while labor&#x27;s leverage approaches zero) is the existential threat to a society posed by major war. I wish it were otherwise. I wish we were a species that could mobilize around solving cancer or clean water in the way we are able to mobilize around killing people.<p>The problem is that, during peace time, the good seem to become complacent and bad peoples&#x27; superior ability at social ascendency and ingratiation puts them into positions of leadership (see: the rightward lurch of American politics after 1980, and the increasing mean-spiritedness of Corporate America beginning around that time). Eventually, the social rot reaches an &quot;overflow&quot; point where the dysfunction of one society or more causes violent conflict. Then there&#x27;s war, which makes good and bad people warlike both.<p>Wars don&#x27;t always make economies improve, of course, and war is pretty much the worst thing imaginable. However, to this point, humanity hasn&#x27;t come up with anything else that gives the disenfranchised enough leverage to shock society out of a cancerous state.<p>I really hoped that Silicon Valley would show the world a way out of that idiotic cycle, but the actual behavior that is in it, thanks to the VCs turning it into Hollywood for Ugly People, has rendered that impossible.",1392347872

Regardless, as a group, they are in no way the kings and policy makers in our society and are barely significant stakeholders.<p>I think it&#x27;s much more likely that the &quot;rich and powerful&quot; who influence the direction of our society all engage in primarily rent-seeking activity.",1392347497

7236631,comment,7235634,7236597,2,0,IgorPartola,,,"Hold on. First, GPG servers are susceptible to the same type of attack, except they would never be used that way. You <i>never</i> look up a person by email, the send them an encrypted message using the key you get. Instead, you verify their key and email address out of band: you meet them, check their credentials, then sign the key. Keybase is trying to get rid of the in-person verification, an effort I applaud, but in favor of a much weaker check: whether a few centralized accounts had been compromised.<p>The other part, where you check Maria&#x27;s Twitter and GitHub accounts, means that a few things like Twitter, and GitHub are impervious to Chloe: a tall order and a centralized one at that.<p>Once again, is the point here for me to get a tuple of (email address, public GPG key) so I can email Maria securely? If so, then someone somewhere has to prove that this tuple fetched from the public key servers is valid.<p>If the point is to only communicate via keybase.io, then the service is centralized, and useless once actual sensitive info is exchanged, the US government takes notice and shuts it down at the DNS level.",1392347463

Coming from Europe, that strikes me as a fascinating American (I presume) statement. From countless conversations I (Libertarian leaning - something which I just discovered in the last few years, did not even know that such a thing existed before that) had in the past in various European countries I found that the size of government was usually completely irrelevant for most people and in fact the majority was in favor of laws, ideas, concepts, movements etc, that de facto would lead to more government and more laws.

7236609,comment,7235810,7236526,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"Saying that a violent revolution is better than a 1918-style flu pandemic is hardly endorsing the concept.<p>Also, the upper class is not &quot;entrepreneurs&quot;-- most of them are well-connected influence peddlers, which makes them the farthest thing from entrepreneurs-- nor is it the same set as &quot;rich people&quot;. (Not all upper class are rich, not all rich are upper class.) The upper class is a closed social network that happens to have a stranglehold on most of society&#x27;s resources, but there are rich people entirely outside of that network, and not all people in that network choose to become rich (although most do, because it doesn&#x27;t take them much work).<p>Is overthrowing the upper class, violently, desirable? No. I&#x27;d rather see them peacefully and gracefully decline into irrelevance. They even get to stay rich. It&#x27;s their belligerence-- that they keep taking more each year-- that gives cause to kill them. It&#x27;s not what they have, it&#x27;s the risk (likelihood?) that they&#x27;ll take more each year, leaving less for the rest. Is overthrowing the upper class morally acceptable? Yes. This is a problem for us to solve, and it may come down to our generation. Violence should be a tool of last resort, but they are already using it against us (if you live in the US, you know about our health insurance system) so we&#x27;d already be in second-strike territory. I have absolutely no moral problem with the violent overthrow of the global elite-- they&#x27;ve already earned it several times over-- but in terms of practicality, desire, and preference, if a nonviolent solution can be had, I&#x27;d rather it be that.",1392347072

He had acquired some of the tanks for just $5000 (time of purchase unknown) from liquidation sale of the former soviet military equipment. Transportation to the US had cost him $50-80K for each tank. Fortunately for you (and unfortunately for everyone else) the collection was going to be liquidated or moved.

I&#x27;ve tried to pick up chess books and sites before a couple times, but I always very quickly feel like I need to memorize a few hundred board positions before anything will make sense (or worse, the &quot;lessons&quot; consist of nothing but THESE 3000 THINGS ARE GOOD, DO THEM). Putting things in a logical order for learning is very helpful.<p>I have to say, though, the exercises really need a better gradient of feedback, especially when you get to the later lessons with some more ambiguous positions. I only &quot;solved&quot; the &quot;make your pieces happy&quot; test by trying moves at random - I had correctly identified f5 as the target square, but I&#x27;m still unclear as to why it needs to be the left-hand knight that works its way over there.

Do you just assume that every random internet service out there is reliable until proven otherwise? Because that&#x27;s the opposite of what&#x27;s correct. Everything is completely unreliable until proven otherwise. This is, yes, obvious if you&#x27;ve been paying attention to the internet for any reasonable length of time. Twitter hasn&#x27;t proven otherwise, therefore it is unreliable. I personally think that more than passes the threshold for &quot;blatantly obvious&quot;.<p>I disagree with you on the impact of pointing out that this was a bad decision. The fact that you can&#x27;t rely on random internet services is an important lesson, and I don&#x27;t think he learned that lesson. He just switched from one random unreliable internet service to another. When Zapier or Xively go down or change authentication requirements or decide he&#x27;s a spammer and shut down his account, does he have some way to find out?<p>I would much rather have someone tell me &quot;that was pretty stupid of you, this was your real mistake here&quot; than hide the truth from me because they&#x27;re afraid of discouraging me.

The Imperial system has a preference for scaling its units by some slightly more practical number of sub-units- 12, 60, etc. I can imagine someone saying, for example, &quot;why name 1000 centimeters as another unit? Can&#x27;t I say &#x27;thousands&#x27; using the same number of syllables? What&#x27;s worth naming a different unit is 240cm since that&#x27;s used a lot with timber...&quot;<p>Someone strictly advocating the metric system would say &quot;that&#x27;s the point, kilo is another way of saying 1000 no matter where you live in the world or what you&#x27;re measuring. Feel free to call 240cm a &#x27;frob&#x27; if you like, but please, only do so in private- don&#x27;t order 14 frobs of lumber, order 33.6 meters.&quot; (edit: which is a perfectly valid point. It&#x27;s the slow accumulation of frobs that made the imperial system untenable. We trade a little bit of efficiency at a local level for greater global efficiency when we adopt metric.)",1407611417

Nobody&#x27;s salary seems to correlate with much except their skill at getting a high salary.  For instance, my sister (elementary education) makes even less than I do as a grad student.  The difference is that she wakes up at 5:00 AM and works all day teaching and taking care of little kids until 7:00 PM, whereas I wake up whenever I feel like it, head to a coffee shop and work on research (which is basically a computer game for me), and mix in bike rides and whatever else as I please.  The difference in salary will be even more extreme once I get my PhD.<p>It really doesn&#x27;t seem fair, and when I think about the vast majority of the world population in other countries, it seems even less fair.  I used to have a more conservative stance that if you want to get more, you just have to work harder, but now I&#x27;ve reversed my stance completely: I think it&#x27;s mostly luck -- where you were born, who you know, what your social skills are, and if you just happen to be in the right place at the right time.<p>Many jobs seem like they exist solely for the sake of creating more jobs.  We have managers of managers of managers.  A lot of people don&#x27;t put a lot of effort into their work (they spend their day browsing the internet), and the ones that do put in an honest effort don&#x27;t seem to be rewarded for it.

The price can be allowed to fluctuate and it can be held at one level while encouraging people to buy during a deeply discounted sale (the Steam model), and that captures some of the consumer surplus through segmentation based on availability. Though most of the gains there are actually in volume (during the sales), especially since it&#x27;s a virtual good. In terms of capturing the entirety of what everyone would be willing to pay, it falls short. Compare the amount of revenue per sale on a hardcover novel vs an e-book, for example. On the one hand the publisher and author may take home tens of dollars, on the other it&#x27;s unlikely to be more than 10. With e-books using the Amazon model basically all of the consumer surplus from anyone willing to pay hardcover prices is lost. Is that made up for by volume? We don&#x27;t know.<p>As for alternate e-book models, as you point out, there are many. And actually crowd funding is a major way to capture that latent consumer surplus (which is one of the big reasons behind its success), but even that is not necessarily a panacea.",1407611059

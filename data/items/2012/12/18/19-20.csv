I'm wondering if any of you have been involved in a situation similar to this.  I'm a bit apprehensive about saying yes, because equity does not necessarily hold value, and it can be diluted by simply issuing more shares.  Is there anything I should ask, or clear up before saying yes to an arrangement like this?  I'm 80% sure that Im not going to agree to an equity only deal, but i wanted to hear what you guys thought.  Thanks.",1355860774

This is why photographers are anal about making sure all people who are identifiable in their photos sign a model release form if they plan to sell the photo for non-editorial uses.<p>If instagram ran this idea by their lawyers I'm sure they've been informed that they should absolutely never use any of these images for advertising if there is an identifiable person in it because otherwise the risk of being sued for it eventually is far too great.",1355860715

He did it without expectations for something in return. He did it for people who couldn't repay Him. He did it for people that were His enemies. This is by definition unconditional and there isn't a single verse in the Bible that contradicts this.<p>Matthew 23:37 - O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.<p>The Matthew verse shows that this love must be accepted. Jesus says that He wants to show His love in a close relationship, but the expressions of His love are rejected.<p>That Matthew verse also points to something that is often overlooked/misunderstood about hell. The worst thing about hell is not fire, darkness, demons, etc. <i>The worst and most significant thing about hell is being separated from God.</i> Heaven is where people have reciprocated God's love and experience complete intimacy with Him. Hell is where people have rejected God and experience complete separation from Him. With that understanding, it shows that it makes no sense to say ""God sent someone to hell."" Hell is the choice of someone that has rejected God's love. God, not being a rapist, does not force anyone to love Him.",1355860534

For the most part, the ""security"" components of app frameworks are boring, modulo some really simple- to- answer questions (""how do you store passwords"", ""how do you handle password resets"").<p>When people talk about ""security frameworks"", they tend to be thinking about what we used to call ""AAA systems"" (authentication/""authn"", authorization/""authz"", and accountability/logging). You don't need to be an appsec practitioner to look at an AAA system and see whether it's any good. Does it apply authn by default? How easy would it be to accidentally expose a method that didn't require a login? Does it apply authz rules by default? How much of a pain would it be to reliably apply authz rules across my project? If stuff is easy and has sane defaults, you'll use them and benefit --- like you do in Rails, if you use association finders off a ""current user"" instead of the class object finders.<p>The bad news is, what you want tested in an app framework is <i>everything else</i>. How's it handling database persistence? How does it handle corner cases, like deliberately pathologically huge queries, out-of-range numerics, conversions between multipart and standard encoding, output encoding of HTML, Javascript, and CSS, CSRF validation, file upload, database column access, &c &c. It's the stuff you don't normally think of as ""security code"" that's most likely to bite you.<p>At Matasano, we have a ""seven deadly features"" in web apps that we tend to find the first and worst flaws in web apps in; they're:<p>1. Password reset<p>2. Email functionality<p>3. Interfaces to thick clients; ""REST API"" &c<p>4. File upload<p>5. File download<p>6. Templating<p>7. ""Advanced search""<p>Only one of those is a security feature, and it's also a security feature that most ""security APIs"" don't actually implement (because every app wants to have a different UX for it).<p>Lest this sound self-interested: most frameworks haven't been formally externally tested. I'd be thrilled if someone had their framework tested formally, but I don't tell people not to use Rails or Django or Spring just because they haven't been pentested by an appsec firm.",1355860462

But I would strongly for them to do it directly, by engaging in activites that center on care and regard for each other. Spending time together, perhaps.<p>Material goods are a poor proxy for that in my case, because they have the effect of actually reducing my quality of life.  I've already got a cluttered house and more possessions than I know what to do with.  It's actually pretty hard for me to think of objects that I genuinely want - so hard that when people give me gift cards, they generally go unused.  I've got more than enough stuff, I'm actively working on having less stuff, and so I'd rather let it go to waste than acquire an object I don't want and will just go unused until I eventually discard it during the next round of decluttering.<p>So in any case I feel bad - either because of guilt over not appreciating an object that I simply can't because it brings me negative utility, or guilt over the money or effort people put into trying to give me an object that brings me negative utility, or for actively involving myself in the acquisition of an object that brings me negative utility, or for the sense of being wasteful that comes with the inevitable disposal of an object that brings me negative utility.  And I would greatly prefer for people to show they care in a way that doesn't make me feel bad.  I just wish I could understand why in this one situation I'm generally considered to be a bad person for wanting my loved ones to not make me feel bad.  Isn't it supposed to be a time of year when we're supposed to gather together and try to make each other feel good?<p>Sadly the ritual just isn't really structured in a way that makes it workable for folks like us. The material gifts are inextricably placed at the core of the social construct, to the extent that there's really no way to extract them for the sake of respecting the feelings someone who doesn't desire a material gift.  So inextricably that we can't just not give an object to someone who would rather not take part in the exchange of objects because we care about them and understand that would make them happier.

One can say we have been slowly sliding towards totalitarianism (plutarchy maybe) and the fact that some people in Michigan are gathering regularly, putting face paint on and then shooting beer cans from AK-47s doesn't make a difference at all.<p>As you agreed Founding Fathers could not have predicted massive surveillance that would make Gestapo proud, satellites, tanks, nuclear weapons, etc. So in their time 100 militia people with rifles could take 100 government solders with rifles and it would be a nice match.<p>> Of course not. That's why we have courts.<p>Alright I agree only if the courts would correctly reinterpret the amendment and let me have a couple of nuclear weapons, some drones with weapons, tanks, and fighter planes. Because what is really meant by ""arms"" these day. But I can't even buy a fully automated machine gun.<p>To me personally, most times guns are used in this country against someone by a civilian they are used either by drunk family members against each other or by criminals.<p>> The authors of the Fourth Amendment probably couldn't have imagined laser microphones, but the courts have held that using one (or anything else high-tech) to eavesdrop on conversations you have in a private place is just like a search and requires a warrant.<p>But their hands are tied. So they can reinterpret the Second Amendment (which I have concluded they haven't as citizens don't get access to matching arms as the government does) but only up to a point. Like it can't reinterpret it so take away the guns. At some point if it is written it is followed blindly like some magic book from the sky.<p>The original article was trying to use the ""reinterpretation loophole"". I don't agree with using loopholes. But I agree with the intent (remove the weapons) by do it by fixing the Amendment. If Amendments can't be passed anymore (practically) then there is something broken about this country.<p>The way it is now, the Amendment does more harm than good.",1355858642

Wikipedia[1] has a good breakdown of the types and restrictions.<p>Basically, if they had shotguns and hunting rifles which fall under the legal categories, then I think they'd be allowed as many as they want provided they pass all the requirements themselves - e.g. criminial record, mental history etc.<p>If they have illegal types - handguns, automatic weapons etc. then it's illegal, regardless of how long they've had them. When handguns were made illegal there was an amnesty but now posession would be illegal.<p>One thing to bear in mind as well, some people argue against banning guns by pointing out that criminals will still get guns. This is true in that it <i>does</i> happen, BUT with a much smaller number of guns it is a) harder for criminals to get guns, and b) much, MUCH easier to track them. Supposedly in London, a lot of crimes are perpetrated with the same guns, and these are much easier to track back to people and therefore much easier to get convictions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_King...</a>",1355857911

Play<p>JSP is just awful - taking PHP and trying to fit it into Java somehow. It's just terrible and needs to be phased out ASAP. (EDIT: Probably too harsh.. JSP works in the same way PHP works: it powers most of the web, and it does a grudgingly good job. The ease of plopping in some dynamic content into am html website made by a designer should not be discounted lightly for small websites. Probably best to just use PHP and not JSP in this use case though...)<p>GWT/GAE/AppScale mix is my preference. You can share code across server and client. Building RESTful services is a dream with Jersey on the server/thick client, and RestyGWT in the browser. The GWT compiler produces some very well performing javascript (only a bit slower than highly optimized libraries, but feels faster than nearly all webapp javascript). GWT also has incredibly good tooling support in automatic sprite sheet creation, compiled CSS styles, uibinder for declarative layouts, etc. The downsides are (1) java language, so no functional programming and (2) compile time can get nasty when you head in the millions-lines-of-code arena. GWT team is seemingly working on speeding up the dev cycle with SuperDevMode and that.<p>Play framework is most similar to the ruby on rails approach and works incredibly well for your standard webapp. The support for Comet and WebSockets are particularly nice and making very dynamic 'push' webapps is the real strongest point. The tooling can get pretty annoying at times with features/bugs, but it is steadily  improving. The biggest downside to Play is that it is in a  'hipster phase' currently with the release of Play 2. This means both a huge surge in interest, but that same surge can be a curse when it drops out of 'hipster' mode in the future and loses devs. Numerous promising frameworks/languages have hit this problem and never really recover when the 'fashion' changes.<p>GWT, for example, has long since fallen out of fashion but continues to be heavily developed because of the huge and profitable existing user base inside Google (Adwords, etc), guaranteeing it active development for awhile to come.",1355857571

My goal was to only have one power cable. So I had the hub and the RPi connected twice. First, a USB host port on the RPi <=> upstream port on the hub. Second, a random port on the hub <=> power on the RPi. Then, the power cable goes into the hub to supply juice to the whole setup. The wall wart for the hub is rated at 2.5 amps, so plenty of power there.<p>There are two things to be concerned about here. First, the RPi can draw up to 700 mA, but a normal hub will only supply 500 mA. Second, a USB hub might not be as good of a power source as a dedicated power block. The first concern is addressed for me by the fact that I'm not running anything CPU intensive and not using the HDMI port (the setup is headless). The second concern did bite me when I plugged in a what I suspect was a faulty or at least a power hungry USB WiFi dongle.

The numbers TSA gives, which are quoted in the article, are that a single exposure to the X-ray scanner gives you the same radiation dose that you get from two minutes of airline flight. So if we think the risk of the scanner is unacceptable, we should also consider it unacceptable for a flight to be lengthened by two minutes. Flight times routinely vary by more than that due to re-routings for things like weather, air traffic control, etc.<p>Nothing is 100% safe. If we are going to try to consider thresholds of safety, we have to consider <i>all</i> possible risks, not just the ones the media is currently harping on. What we find when we do that is that we routinely accept risks far greater than the ones the media is currently harping on. But those risks don't sell papers or keep people watching.",1355857208

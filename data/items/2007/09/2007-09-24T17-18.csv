58979,comment,58915,58915,0,0,Goladus,,,"Plan out exactly what you want for the web app on paper, and be as precise and consistent as possible.<p>Then pick a language and set up a development environment.  (A difficult step to get past, but you might be able to get someone to help you do this for free)<p>Then start reading tutorials and doing practice examples.  <p>Once you have a feel for how to get a basic app up and running, go back to the specs you wrote earlier and identify some subset that you want to implement.<p>Begin implementing your idea until you get stuck.  When you get stuck, research the language tools you need to get unstuck.  If you find yourself hopelessly lost, either pick a different subset of your app to work on, or go back to reading textbooks, tutorials, and forums until you better understand the concepts.<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/pfaq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/pfaq.html</a>",1190656674

58968,comment,58924,58924,0,0,gscott,,,"What I found most interesting is that he has a successful business but no programmers, other then himself, and this one Ruby/Rails developer (for 2 years but now gone).  Yet he has legions of support staff.<p>Having 1 hired person to rewrite your 90,000 lines of code into another language will burn that person out.  Hire the expensive professional programmer but also hire a much cheaper 'newbie' and have him train from the ground up to replace the professional who is going to move on to bigger better things.  In a few months the newbie should be programming on the main project and will have excitement and passion because he is excited (more excited then the professional hired gun). <p>I am also curious about the ""retraining"" that would have to happen for the support staff.  I thought they were writing more or less a clone of what was there so why the retraining, if it all looks the same, it should interact with the user/employees the same therefore no retraining would be necessary.",1190654874
58967,comment,58915,58915,0,0,johnrob,,,"I don't know how you can find a good hacker, because there is no way for you to judge one.  That aside, your best bet is to offer a lot of equity in the startup.  More than half of the company.  Your biggest selling point is that you will take care of all the stuff that annoys hackers - designing UI screens, marketing, face time with real users.  If your idea is good, you offer more than 50% equity, and take care of the non technical work, you are providing a pretty good deal.
What you have to remember is that, as a non-hacker, you should feel lucky to be in the game at all.  There are only two things startups REALLY need - money and hackers.  If you don't bring one of those items, it's hard to make a case for being the major stakeholder.",1190654492

And when the end result is the same, what PHP provides in the way of stability/industry uptake/user community/compatibility outweighs whatever gains in ""programmer happiness"" and all the other intangibles commonly flailed about by the Ruby/Rails community.",1190653771

58959,comment,58915,58915,0,0,rickcecil,,,"Being in the same boat as you, I found the following to be worthwhile<p>1) Evaluate yourself and the skills you bring to the table. It's all in how you sell yourself. Even though I can't program, I understand experience design, business, visual design, and can get my hands dirty with some HTML and CSS. <p>2) Network locally. You're probably not going to find anyone worth working with online. Especially if you start out: ""I have a great idea, but can't code. Wanna help?"" <p>3) Be open to new ideas; people generally want to participate in the idea construction and product design. They don't want to pick up something that's been thought completely through.<p>4) Be willing to plunk down some cash. Get a tech lead for your project who can manage people you pay to build your system. If it's simple enough, you can build a decent app for less than $10K.",1190653251

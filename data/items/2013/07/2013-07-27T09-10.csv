6112378,comment,6112174,6112174,7,0,stiff,,,"One of the biggest problem humanity currently has in general is that morality only kicks-in in most people when there is a very direct link between their actions and some negative consequences. Once there is enough degrees of separation and abstraction nobody cares anymore. Most people would not slaughter an animal without really having to do it, but once it becomes a cheeseburger or a fur clothing nobody gives it a second thought. The problem is that the world of human affairs is getting more and more abstract as we specialize more and more and develop more complex technology, so more and more things get affected by this.<p>It is especially sad given that sometimes sacrificing a small convenience for one person would be able to make a huge change in somebody else&#x27;s life. But again, once there are enough degrees of separation, we do not feel &quot;in position&quot; to help and we do not view it as our problem to do it.",1374918677

6112369,comment,6110671,6111339,2,0,tsahyt,,,"More or less, yes. What he is saying is that there is a constant hidden in the big O. Say, we have two algorithms A and B with a runtime that can be bounded by the functions a(n) = 1000n^2 and b(n) = 0.001n^3 respectively. Hence a  O(n^2) and b  O(n^3). So the first algorithm A is clearly faster asymptotically. However, suppose we have input sizes of around n=50000, it actually turns out that algorithm B is faster because g(50000) < f(50000). This is because of the constant that is hidden in the big O. For sufficiently large n however (n > 10000000 in this case), algorithm A will always be faster.<p>A good implementation could check problem sizes beforehand and chose the algorithm accordingly.<p>What I don&#x27;t agree with is that &quot;big O only matters for big input sizes&quot;. Big is not really a well-defined term. The problem here is that &quot;big&quot; depends entirely on the algorithms. It might also be n > 10.

It was liberating when I found that VISA has python bindings. I now do all the instrument-interfacing code in Python+Qt. It is so much more productive that it makes me wonder why do people still want to use labview for this kind of job. I mean its visual language is complicated that it makes even the simplest things (like formatting a string) difficult. And on the top of that if you try to make something more complex the block diagram is completely unreadable. Madness.",1374916034

If you really want to &quot;get&quot; Haskell, Forth and Lisp you have to &quot;think&quot; their way.<p>There is a good reason why one of the most important Forth books was titled &quot;Thinking Forth&quot;. Lisp is also very different from C and Java, and you have to change your thinking radically to understand and to apply the power of Lisp. Now I am determined to learn Haskell, and I believe that I have to change my thinking much more into a mathematical approach.",1374916025

The positive articles contain pretty much the same enumeration of Go features (goroutines, channels, imports, etc.) or how they rewrote a five year old, now well-understood, failing Python subsystem in Go and have massive improvements (surprise). The negative articles pretty much all complained about how not using an import results in a compilation error (surprisingly, the lack of generics are only mentioned in comments ;)).<p>But these slides were genuinely interesting to pretty much the whole HN audience: it covers architecture decisions, the effect of code rot, the breadth of the Go standard library, a new object caching system, and a real-world example of Go usage.<p>tl;dr even to someone who is a bit critical towards Go (ie. me), it was a very interesting read.",1374915812

And, nothing beats it for data acquisition and testing. Like all visual languages big projects and the finer implementation details can get ugly.<p>Most people focus in LV&#x27;s visual programming paradigm. But I think its real power come from the Flow Based Programming model. Functional programming is the trendy solution to the problem of concurrency these days. But I think FBP could offer some solutions in this domain too.

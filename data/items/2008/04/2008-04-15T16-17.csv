A rarely mentioned part of the book is where he gives you steps to build a business like his.  First, you have to do a <i>lot</i> of work, including doing <i>everything</i> from answering phones, writing marketing copy, packaging every item, etc <i>by yourself</i>.  Only when you have a product, traction, customers, and experience managing them, can you write the scripts, evaluate vendors and outsourcers, and streamline the business so that a customer can buy, receive, return, or complain about your product without ever encountering you.<p>Despite the popular misconception, Tim Ferriss says you still have to <i>build</i> your own business.  But if you pick the right business, you can put it on autopilot <i>once it's built</i>.  But that aspect isn't controversial enough to get a lot of press.<p>Did you read the book or just hear about it?",1208278544

It isn't happening as quickly as I'd hoped, but as bandwidth gets cheaper and faster, and televisions get more connected to the net, I'm expecting the film industry to change quite dramatically. The emergence of cheap digital filmmaking and web-based distribution networks will be similar to the recent change in dynamic of web startups.

Consumers want to fulfill whatever goals they have - caring for their family, being entertained, feeling adrenaline, getting laid, etc.  Buying a home is ($#@%%^#!#($#@!!) expensive, but it makes my family warm, comfortable and secure.

Media entertains me, which makes me laugh, think, feel, etc.  They don't make me money, but they do make me richer.<p>It's easy for B2C to make consumers richer (all of the Facebooks, etc do that), the tough question is which of these riches will they pay for?  The consumer market (especially in the US) is so huge and wealthy (yes, even in a down market) that it's worth gambling on.",1208275675

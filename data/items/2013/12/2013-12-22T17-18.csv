6950950,comment,6950444,6950444,1,0,memracom,,,"Async is an important category that deserves better coverage. Fundamentally, REST and the alternatives (SOAP, etc.) are all RPC protocols. They may make use of the RPC nature of HTTP or maybe like XML-RPC they shove another RPC layer on top. A remote procedure call sounds like the simplest component of a remote api, but it is not. In RPC you make a request and wait for a reply.<p>But with async, you send a message and that is it. This can be implemented on top of HTTP RPC such as with Websockets, but the HTTP layer is unnecessary. Messaging using the AMQP protocol is a nice alternative. You can open a socket and hold it open for sending and receiving messages. When you send a message, it can be received by an MQ broker like RabbitMQ for guaranteed delivery to whatever internal service(s) need to process it. And when some kind of result needs to be sent back to the message originator, the socket is open and ready to receive it. For those things where the app needs RPC, it is simple to send a message and wait for a reply message. But when all you need is a notification going out, or coming in, that works too.<p>While MQTT and ZeroMQ and others could be used, it would be nicer if the Internet standardized on AMQP at a known port (just like HTTP) and even included the use of an MQ broker with all the optional services (topic queues, persistence, guaranteed delivery) that can be provided.",1387734451

If that perception changed, prices would come down, and we&#x27;d eventually get back to a system where you could buy a home for 2X your annual income.<p>The problem with a return to a sane system is that it would bury existing homeowners, and we aren&#x27;t willing to accept the pain in the short run.

You can still have a sync&#x27;d directory of Ebuilds, which correspond to FreeBSD Makefiles, only you have the added benefit of USE flags, compilation options, and even binary packages.<p>You can run Portage on FreeBSD.<p>Gentoo still uses, by default, OpenRC, which is a BSD-like init system that also handles dependencies. It is compatible with other FreeBSD and NetBSD scripts as well.<p>You can run OpenRC on FreeBSD and NetBSD.<p>Arch, on the other hand, has Fedora&#x27;s systemd, which is completely incompatible with any of the BSD&#x27;s thanks to its use of cgroups, which are a Linux kernel only feature, and the developers of systemd have dismissed, openly, the BSDs as outdated and unimportant.<p>Arch also uses binary packages for most of its packages, which is closer to rpm/dpkg than it is to Portage/ports.<p>The AUR is a limited system designed for pulling in alternative and source packages. It lacks USE flags and compile-time and runtime end user control. The AUR is mostly managed by the community, and many AUR packages have a lower quality than the base pacman available packages. The less popular a particular AUR package, the less people will be involved in it, and the lower quality it will be.<p>On the flipside, the BSDs have impeccable quality packages. They&#x27;re not configurable without tweaking stuff manually, but the defaults are rock solid.<p>Gentoo&#x27;s core Portage tree packages are managed by official developers who are assigned duties. And like the AUR, the community is able to apply any number of &quot;overlays&quot; on top of the Portage tree, giving the community direct ease of modification of not only community packages, but core ones as well.<p>So, how is Arch the &quot;best of BSD and Linux&quot; when it has absolutely nothing to do with BSD?",1387732247

6950809,comment,6949329,6950195,3,0,pkolaczk,,,"First, there is difference between reliability and availability. IMHO availability is a subset of reliability.<p>Not saying they are unreliable per se, but making them really highly available is much, much harder than some NoSQL stores designed for HA, and the solutions are much more complex, usually beyond the point of being able to prove their correctness. It will cost you lots of effort, money and hardware. And to make it network-partition-tolerant, you&#x27;ll have to give up ACID anyway, so one of the main advantage of RDBMSes over NoSQL stores goes away. IMHO not worth the trouble. In fact, most of the RDBMS systems operating in banks and insurance institutions I&#x27;ve seen were not even fully ACID. They were AD + eventually C and very relaxed I. You really don&#x27;t need full ACID to handle money, it is just a convenient model for programmers.<p>I can see systems based on RDBMSes, even the most expensive ones, claiming 7 nines availability on paper <i>do actually fail</i> and sometimes in a totally weird ways, that fixing the mess takes too long. I know some of the companies migrated to NoSQL stores exactly because of this reason - an expensive RDBMS cluster failing after hardware accident while another NoSQL cluster still operating fine in the same datacenter, despite networking problems. I&#x27;ve seen that simply way too often happening to big names, including a few commercial banks and telecoms in Poland, to believe in marketing of HA RDBMS store. Sure, all of them recovered (sometimes after minutes and in one case after a <i>week</i>) and none lost any data, therefore I&#x27;m not saying RDBMSes are unreliable ;)<p>This is exactly a similar story as with scalability. Can RDBMSes be scaled? Yes, they can. But it is expensive, hard and requires very careful application design. It does not work automagically by &quot;I&#x27;ll simply normalize and throw my queries at it&quot;.",1387732192

This is especially true IMO for those that are likely far less informed than the HN crowd.<p>Due to how amortization works, it&#x27;s very unrealistic to assume that with a $1k/mo mortgage payment, that $900 of that is going to equity.  In fact, in most cases (standard down payment, 15 or 30 year mortgage, etc.), it&#x27;d be closer to the opposite of what you outline, especially at the beginning of the loan term.  You can pull up a calculator to see for yourself but typically in the first few years of a new mortgage you&#x27;ll be paying closer to $900 of that $1k towards INTEREST with the remaining going to principle / money that you may see later assuming home value is indeed retained.<p>That said, I hate paying rent -- but I&#x27;ve also been &quot;burned&quot; a bit on home purchases a couple of times, too!  ;-)<p>EDIT - As someone above mentioned, you also have to keep in mind things such as PMI, property taxes & special levies, upkeep, etc...",1387732123

6950801,comment,6948807,6949094,1,0,ufmace,,,"Yeah, I thought of that. The trouble is, in Ruby, that works nicely as syntactic sugar because of the dynamically typed nature of the language. Methods have no declared return types, variables also have no declared types, arrays and other data structures hold any kind of object, and you can try and do anything to any variable, and the interpreter will figure out at runtime if that&#x27;s possible and throw if it can&#x27;t do it. When you &quot;return a, b&quot;, it&#x27;s clearly an array of objects, since that&#x27;s the only array Ruby has, and it doesn&#x27;t matter what the types of a and b are, since the array can hold any type, and the return type is never declared anyways. When you go to use it, you can do &quot;a, b = foo()&quot;, which is fine, since you don&#x27;t have to declare types of variables anyways. You can try and do anything to those a and b after foo, and the interpreter figures it out at runtime.<p>In C#, and I expect Java and most other more statically typed languages, you run into all kinds of awkwardness doing this. Arrays and other data structures are strongly typed by default, and number and type of method returns must be declared. You could return a object[], which is easy enough to declare, but then on the call side, you&#x27;d have to declare a object[] to receive the return, then individually cast each element to whatever type it&#x27;s supposed to be before you can do anything with it. Kinda awkward, and against the spirit of the language.<p>Declaring multiple returns of different types doesn&#x27;t seem to help much, either, since you can&#x27;t declare 2 variables of different types on the same line, so you have to declare them both somewhere else, making it about as awkward as using out params.<p>The best solution I can think of that fits with the spirit of the language is to use anonymous types. You can already do:<p>var something = new { Foo = a, Bar = b };\nsomething.Foo.DoStuff();\nsomething.Bar.DoStuff();<p>In that case, the compiler creates a class for &quot;something&quot; for you invisibly, based on the properties you assigned. What&#x27;s neat about that is that it maintains strong typing of everything, since it figured out the types from the declaration, so you can still do things with the Foo and Bar properties, and it knows what types they are and enforces all of the standard compile-time type checking.<p>The downside is that you can&#x27;t return these anonymous types from a method, as the method return type must normally be statically declared. You could return dynamic, but then you lose all of that static type checking, and are back to a slightly cleaner version of returning object[]. I suppose the language authors figured that it&#x27;s too complex to return anonymous types from methods, as far as figuring out at compile-time what you&#x27;re actually calling and what it would return.<p>And now that I think I&#x27;ve successfully argued myself out of what I originally wanted to do with a ridiculous number of words, I&#x27;ll just give up.",1387732004

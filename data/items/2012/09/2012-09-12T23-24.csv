I feel like Apple is probably the only company who would go that extra mile to make cables user friendly -- I just don't see other companies making an effort to make cables friendlier to users.

Or rather, if the secret seems to be finding talented teams and mentoring them (rather than great ideas), where will 
a small investor get attention when YC has worldwide reach?<p>Edit: is it fair to say that mentoring and experience are all well and good but handing over enough cash that a small company just cannot go bust (ie the 150k each YC supposedly gets) actually more useful - telling people not to do something may help but paying for their survival while they learn the lesson is pretty good too.<p>I have sometimes thought it would be a good idea for governemnts to pay young people entrepreneur stipend - basically YC for anyone.

The startup gods are wrong.<p>Listen, solving a problem is what we need more of in this world. It's hard, its rewarding, and the idea of it is sexy though the problem itself may not be. That said, solving some problem is not the only way to succeed or be relevant. Some things can be cool and sexy and total non-needs and still be a huge hit. Some things that are just fun and entertainment are not just successful but important in our lives! Yes, important! Like Zynga. I fucking hate them but they make freaking games and they're doing damn well (their downward spiral is irrelevant and unrelated to my point). How about the cheeseburger network (you know, Lolcats, I can has cheeseburger and all that?). Useless, entertaining, non-problem-solving ideas that are big hits.<p>I honestly say fuck solving problems. You know whats really important when it comes to starting a startup no matter if it solves a problem or not? It's this question:<p>Can I get people to give me money for this?<p>If the answer is yes then it's a good idea. Solving problems is awesome and if you think of something that solves a problem that you'll get money from that's even more awesome.

I'd file them all under ""good to know"".<p>Sure, you can generally get by without low level knowledge, but it's nice knowing why certain design decisions were made. And as far as C goes, I think it's extremely useful to be familiar with how it translates to assembly, at least in general. It is knowledge that you will use regularly if you're programming in C in any significant capacity.<p>For example, reasoning about ABIs is something you'll have to do if you ever write a stable library interface. Reasoning about ABIs requires you to know the asm-level calling convention for the platform you're coding on.",1347493468

I was incredibly lucky in that I came of age just in time to leverage the low standards of the height of the dot-com boom.  (I was then able to gain enough knowledge, experience and connections that I was able to continue working through the crash.  I think I can take credit for making good use of the opportunity;  but I wouldn't have had the opportunity if I tried to start doing the same thing in 2001 or 2002.)<p>California really is all about the boom and the bust.  But this part of California, specifically, is interesting in it's cultural makeup.  I can go to parties where I know one person, and I'll meet three customers.

When NFC stops sucking I'll stop saying it sucks.<p>I thought bump was awesome too, then I realized how inconvenient it was. I could hand you a business card, or I could fiddle with my phone, show you how to download the app, etc. NFC is bump with out the bumping.

The Chinese article is three pages long but their summary only covers details from the first page. The second page features personal stories from several employees and their families, which the journalist said made a much deeper impression than the tasks he went through as an undercover employee. The third is a commentary along the lines of ""is this the best China can do?"" (i.e. forever be implementing other countries' creativity, instead of being the inventors), and a final reflection saying that working conditions at Foxconn have improved greatly over the last two years (apparently working undercover at Foxconn is something that's been done several times before), but the hostile attitude toward employees has not improved.<p>Aside the editorial content at the end, I think the article was quite fair in that the journalist simply reporte what he saw (if the windows really have screens installed for suicide prevention, merely describing this fact does not make an article ""trash"").

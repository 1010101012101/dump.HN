Drone deliveries are just one way to cut down on delivery latency. The continued existence of brick and mortar stores is a good example of the value of low latency delivery, often at a high premium. If you can spend the money that would have been spent on storefront rent, attendant wages, and distributed inventory instead on drone systems then maybe in some cases it&#x27;s a worthwhile tradeoff.",1388818722

7010303,comment,7004644,7007762,2,0,lambda,,,"Controlled studies about lifelong effects of fairly fundamental parts of your life such as diet are quite difficult to do, especially with large enough populations to be statistically significant and without being overly affected by their dropout rate.<p>Observational studies have significant problems, as I <i>explicitly pointed out in my comment about the study</i>. However, they have some advantages in that they are a lot easier to do for larger populations over a longer time period.<p>Both of these are valid scientific techniques, to inform us about what is most likely to be a healthy way to eat. There are, of course, other valid techniques, such as studying immediate metabolic effects of ingesting certain foods, and linking those to known risk factors for a variety of conditions. Science is not a single, infallible technique, it is a set of techniques which taken together are intended to give us the best approximation of the truth, though every method can fail in certain ways.<p>Diet is an especially difficult topic. Human bodies, human behavior, and differences between different people are quite complex. There are a lot of people who are afraid of diseases of affluence or degenerative diseases that you see coming up more often simply due to our longer lifespan. Lots of people are interested in solving these problems, and I think that a lot of people jump to over-simplifying conclusions on these topics. We&#x27;ve seen this played out in the past; a huge over-emphasis on low-fat diets, that seems to have left us unhealthier than ever. Warnings about dietary cholesterol, when it turns out that the cholesterol in our blood stream has very little correlation to cholesterol consumed.<p>Every time I hear about some new extreme diet that is supposed to work wonders, I get concerned. Low fat, low sodium, low carb, no carb, paleo, high protein, high fat, vegan, raw, gluten free, dairy free and so on. Most of these things seem to focus on some single source of evil, and claim to offer amazing benefits if you follow them. Most of those benefits don&#x27;t actually play out; despite the huge push for low-fat diets over the 80s and 90s, obesity continued rising at an alarming rate. Despite the huge popularity of Atkins, &quot;paleo&quot;, and other low carb diets over the past decade, it has continued to rise.<p>People keep searching for a silver bullet, and in diets, like much of life, there is no silver bullet. Eat less, exercise more, eat healthier foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains while reducing the amount of sugars and fats, avoiding too much processed food and so on is not some amazing new diet plan that you&#x27;ll be able to sell some fancy book about, but it&#x27;s pretty much the actual advice you need to follow if you want to stay healthier.<p>Anyhow, I see this over and over again, and then I hear from eager people who want to tell me that low-carb, no fasting, no gluten free, no lactose free diets will help them lose weight, prevent cancer, prevent heart disease, prevent Alzheimers, prevent autism or ADHD, do all of the above and more, and there&#x27;s no risk, they&#x27;re so healthy, why would anyone not do this? And then I read the literature, and I find that actually, this new diet has quicker effects in the first six months but is about as effective as the last fad diet was after a year, and actually it does have certain dangers, and so on.<p>Eat less, exercise more, keep it healthy. Beyond that, don&#x27;t worry too much, and do everything in moderation. Take all dietary science with a grain of salt, since it&#x27;s a tough field to study the real, long term effects of (20 year studies are considered to be long term studies, but that&#x27;s only a fraction of a life, meaning that many real long term effects get very little study). Take industrial food with an even larger grain of salt, as it&#x27;s more likely optimized for shelf life, profitability, or narrow nutrition claims to be able to put some particular label on it, rather than flavor and health. Don&#x27;t drink soda; I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s regular or diet, or whether the sugar is corn syrup or cane sugar. Soda is always extra calories that you don&#x27;t need, or extra sweetness sans calories that confuses your body. And don&#x27;t drink venti mochafrappucaremelates, or whatever the hell they&#x27;re called. Don&#x27;t eat salty snacks on a regular basis, but don&#x27;t be afraid to put a pinch of salt in your food to make it taste good. Don&#x27;t have dessert with every meal, but don&#x27;t be afraid to have a slice of cake at a birthday party.<p>Anyhow, rant over. I just get upset when I see people getting religious over some new diet fad, which in 10 years will be the diet that the people selling a new diet fad will be talking about in their &quot;you&#x27;ve been lied to for all of these years. Learn how to really stay healthy and lean!&quot;",1388818526

7010296,comment,7009995,7009995,6,0,lhl,,,"I&#x27;ve been a paying customer almost from the start. Unfortunately, as Evernote has expanded, it&#x27;s gotten less and less useful for me.<p>Their web clipper is great, the best around IMO (especially since Clipboard folded), however there&#x27;s no way to exclude those clipped pages from search, so after using the clipper for a while, searching for just about any phrase is mostly irrelevant results. Ideally it&#x27;d be possible to filter by source or have default searches to exclude certain types of content.<p>Another example of this is that I have a well-curated and geotagged Travel Notebook (this was actually much harder than it should have been since their geocoder is picky and you can&#x27;t really massage it). I&#x27;d love to be able to see these notes on a map, but the &quot;Atlas&quot; map view that Evernote provides doesn&#x27;t let you filter by notebook (or anything really).<p>Evernote does a great job of making it fairly painless to capture notes and despite the author&#x27;s problems, has generally worked well on syncing everything.  It&#x27;s never done a good job for triaging/filing/finding or organizing notes though, and it seems to simply get worse as you use it more (and with each redesign).  Evernote seems to want to encourage you to put &quot;everything&quot; into it, but as you do, it becomes harder and harder to get what you need out of it.  Honestly, I&#x27;m baffled at how the Evernote devs/designers use it.",1388818337

The reason for the two account numbers was that they were billed differently: house power as normal, streetlight at a fixed rate paid once every other month.<p>To add to the complexity, we were enrolled in an estimated payments plan. Our costs stayed they same, month to month, with adjustments twice a year to update our average payment amount up/down.<p>Before the new billing system, we received bills once a month - with the amount fluctuating every other month by the cost of the outdoor light.<p>Under the new system, we had the &quot;estimated payments&quot; check marked, the reps could see it in the system, they claimed we were enrolled - but our bills that arrived acted as though we weren&#x27;t in that payment plan.<p>They couldn&#x27;t explain it.

I implemented it for <a href=\"https://GAuthify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://GAuthify.com</a> to do this type of thing as a service. Really glad that to some extent they followed the spec but still don&#x27;t understand why they decided to go with a proprietary app.<p>The Google Authenticator app is installed on many phones (compare app store reviews of Duo Security, Authy, and Google Auth), has a very low barrier to install (install and scan, no forms), and it looks good after recent updates. One of the reasons I made GAuthify was to help people adhere to the standard and keep one app as the dock for 2FA (and consequently make it so easy everyone uses 2FA). Not sure what the seemingly present need for branding your 2FA is for...",1388815955

This post just reminded me to cancel my Evernote pro-account and move all my stuff over to -- I guess, Google Docs? (as others have recommended). For receipts, I&#x27;ve been using the Flickr app to auto-upload my iPhone photos into a private folder. Then, I just send download links to accounting for reimbursement. It&#x27;s even easier than Dropbox -- and it&#x27;s free for up to 1 TB. The security issues are scary...it&#x27;d be interesting to see Evernote&#x27;s reply.",1388815653

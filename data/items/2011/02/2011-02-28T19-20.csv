2272638,comment,2271866,2271866,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"There were suicides at Foxconn because the jobs were HELL.  US workers would not put up with such working conditions.  So, China used slave labor to take our jobs?  There are several points:  (1) In a sense, if they want to do the work for wildly little money and sell the results to use, then we get to buy cheap at their loss.  (2) But we lose the jobs.  (3) As Grove points out, they build an 'industrial base' and we lose ours so that later they can raise their prices and we won't be able to do anything about it.  Net, as Grove suggests, they have an 'economic strategy' and we don't.<p>Grove omits a big, huge point:  Why is China 'open'?  Because the US worked to make it 'open' -- remember, ""Nixon went to China."".  Why?  Foreign policy:  Get China doing international trade, make them 'addicted' to it, and then lean back and tell ourselves that now we have China where in their foreign policy they have to behave.  So, if they misbehave, then we won't buy their computers and then we won't have computers.  Hmm???<p>Part of the idea was that if we let China, or some such, sell us labor intensive goods, then they would get the cash to buy our high tech goods from Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, etc.  Of course, soon enough China took apart a Cisco router and saw how to build their own.  For Microsoft software, they copy, cheat, and don't pay.  For Intel?  Actually, Taiwan can make chips, and, really, also design them,  Maybe Intel is ahead in the design, a little.<p>Looks like we have China just where they want us.<p>Likely the US economy is the only significant one that exposes its workers to slave labor competition via 'national economic policy' attacks from overseas.<p>That we believe so much how 'free enterprise' and 'competition' will protect us is foolish:  Around 1890 in the US we saw how various 'deals' could grab a market, create a monopoly, and hold it.  Eventually we passed various anti-trust acts to make such things illegal.  Of course those anti-trust acts don't apply to China!  So, for that 1890 stuff, they can use it against us, and they are.  E.g., the pick an industry, attack it, lose money if necessary, or just use slave labor, run all other companies out of business, and then raise prices.  So, they 'take' a market.  Once they have it, it will be tough for us  to take it back.  They know that.  The econ profs like Blinder don't count the 'asset' of 'market position'; so they are eager to see the asset thrown away.  Try to get the market position back and will see how valuable that asset was.<p>Net, a few people in the US are doing well and like what is going on.  Many others have their careers ruined and just drink 'free enterprise' Kool Aid.",1298923180

There are several platforms that work based on this sharing skills principles, but often money based. Usually seen as a contest platform where the client requests and users (designers) responds buy uploading their work. Examples of this are Crowdspring www.crowdspring.com and in a smaller scale DesignRider www.designrider.com. Why not build a sharing platform like these for open-sources projects?<p>For a best results return, the briefing (instructions, guidelines, rules, project intention description, for instance) should be clear and precise. For instance, by  specifying the format in which you want your design work will already scan designers skills and give you more to the point results. Of course, conversation is always welcome, a mailing list /forum in such platform to discuss and share knowledge between developers and designers cannot hurt either.<p>""Designers are scared of developers. Developers speak a foreign language, they are like aliens."" Simon HÃ¸rup Eskildsen. I don't think is there such a big barrier between designers and programmers or developers. It is time to drop that assumption. A web based platform that gets both working on several open sources projects is a solution to consider and that might bring more responses that you can think of.",1298922560

I don't think so.  I love the intent of Hipmunk but to say disruptive implies a deeper seated change that I don't think Hipmunk is driving in flights.  You mentioned Square which both solves an interface pain point but is also shifting payments to a mobile on-site platform for small businesses.  They are doing business differently because of Square and are able to service a new segment of customers they were not able to before (ones with credit cards).<p>What would be disruptive to the airline industry?  I think to disrupt the industry, you would need to change the way people fly or how they buy/book air travel as a whole.  One idea that I think would be considered disruptive is if someone introduced pre-paid flight vouchers to lock in prices much like you would to gas/oil contracts.  This would change the airline's supply/demand model, it would change the way we ""hunt"" for low prices, and change the general way we view air travel (instead of waiting for a low price, we've already paid for x number of flights so we're free to go as needed).<p>The other points in the article are generally spot on for startups to focus on your power users and build a fan base.

I'll volunteer what I hope is constructive criticism.<p>- As others have mentioned, the title is misleading/bad.<p>- There's very little tying back what's being expressed to specific actions that Hipmunk has done. For instance the sections ""Be Disruptive, But Respectful"" and ""Call Out Your Competitor"" would have been better if they had actually pointed to or quoted from something issued by Hipmunk that was respectful or called out a competitor. Many of the sections use examples from completely different companies, which would be fine, if there was at least one specific concrete example from Hipmunk.<p>- Having been part of a recently built flights meta search engine I just see your bit about ""Look For An Industry That Rarely Changes"" to be completely uninformed. Not sure what scope you're talking about, but travel, airline, online booking and flight meta-search have all changed a lot over the past few years.<p>- In the one place where you did use a concrete example, ""Work Towards Building Fanatics"" the example is the mascot. A few more, and more substantive, examples would have helped.<p>- Finally it would have been appropriate to point out some of the weaknesses of Hipmunk to build credibility, and ease the breathless tone. Perhaps in the section about ""power users."" As someone who travels a lot I tried Hipmunk but currently mostly use Kayak (note that's not the one I worked on) because it has more flights and more search options.

As you know, most hackers attempt to do this by tunneling through one or more compromised systems, but here is a way that might actually be somewhat legal:<p>Go to any place where two public wireless networks overlap, and leave one of these devices in the overlap zone and connected to both networks.  Arrange the networking so that you can tunnel out of one wireless network and back into the other.  Do this in a few such places and you have a series of hops that can make it quite challenging to trace traffic back to you.  Have your device retain no logs and include a remote power shutoff, so if somebody is chasing you from the destination network, by the time the physical plug is discovered (if it is at all, these things are easy to conceal) the router logs for the source network and ISP have long cycled.<p>If you are doing something really nefarious, do all of this on a battery-operated Gumstix and leave it in a trashcan between a Starbucks and a public library.  The battery would probably last you all day, and then the garbage truck will dispose of all evidence by next morning without any intervention.",1298919871

You could obviously write your code to deal with mouse and keyboard interaction, but it's even more overhead on something that is already quite slow, and even if you could interact with individual elements it brings me to the other thing...<p>2) Flash has everything in layers that can be updated independently, when it comes to canvas if you want to change something you have to redraw that section of the image entirely, something that isn't always practical which means you end up redrawing the whole canvas. Essentially Flash does the same thing, but as the compositing is handled by the plugin it is far faster than anything you can do in Javascript at the moment.<p>Also related to the above, the drawImage method that draws bitmap data to the canvas is painfully slow at the moment, so compositing using that is out of the question. If that can be optimised significantly it will certainly help.<p>Basically canvas is too low level to duplicate the kind of functionality Flash offers at the moment. Until manipulating the canvas and Javascript is optimised further it's not possible to layer in the interaction or flexibility of rendering that Flash has. I'm sure a framework offering this will happen one day, but it won't be any time soon.",1268318560

Nobody is going to break TLS in order to get Zumodrive data.<p>Cryptography has exactly one implication for attackers: it is an opportunity to cause unexpected things to happen at the target. This is only possible when you do something unusual with cryptography. From that perspective, Tarsnap worries me more than Zumodrive: there is nothing that is going to go wrong with their SSL implementation that I'll be able to take advantage of, and I can't say that about your contraption.<p>(Here you will inevitably point to a string of OpenSSL security advisories to attempt to refute this point. You won't be convincing, for two reasons. First, it's been a long time since someone found an OpenSSL flaw that would move the dials for an attacker in a basic one-way-authenticated SSL session. Second, no security practitioner would trust your code <i>more</i> than OpenSSL, which, while terrible, has had something like 15 years of audit exposure.)<p>From what I can see, nobody professional has stated that they've looked at Zumodrive <i>or</i> Tarsnap. I'm pulling for you, Colin, but you haven't earned the right to impugn other people's security.<p>You should rewrite your article. Instead of trying to tear down a competitor, you should write an article about how Tarsnap is different from other backup solutions. You should write about how your threat model is different, and how you believe you're the only solution that has been architected to encrypt backup data in such a way that even the hosting providers can't access it.<p>You blew a bunch of credibility by trying to make these points while sniping at a competitor. Instead of thinking about how great Tarsnap is, I'm left questioning the objectivity of every line you wrote. What a waste!

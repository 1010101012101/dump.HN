The problem is, the only people who can interpret that information are the same people who directly profit from my choice. They will suggest unnecessary and potentially harmful things. I guess I could go to medical school to really understand things well enough to make a truly informed decision. That would be great for the concept of separation of labor!<p>Of course I am probably just being paranoid. We should instead head back to the good ol' free market medicine days, when anyone could put anything in a bottle and sell it as a patent cure-all. Back then people lived way longer, and had way better options for medicine.<p>Please note: I'm not saying the system isn't messed up, I'm saying you solution really isn't much better.",1277157573

I have met many. The point is that different people have very different reactions to food, in terms of hunger, mental reward pathways, tendency to burn off calories through adjusting subjective energy levels (e.g. lethargy) and things like jittering, and hormonal responses. Some of this is affected by the kinds of foods we eat, and much of it is affected by genetics.<p>The real point is that we can do better than saying ""just eat less and exercise more"" by looking at things from a different perspective.

I've not weighed myself once, I have no interest in my weight, or my BMI. My waist (and the requirement to have bought and thrown away quite a few trousers and shirts in the 10 months) are as much of an indicator as is needed. I want to become fit for life and not set goals to attain and get quick wins but make no long-term impact.<p>1) Never skip any meal. You are using a short-term, unsustainable, trick to drop some lbs you are guaranteed to put back on because you are not teaching yourself anything sustainable (same reason that low carb diets don't work long term for 90% of people).<p>2) Weighing yourself all the time when losing weight by diet alone is a psychological game that suggests you have a ""goal"" weight in mind which you will get to and have not gained any idea of food discipline or life-long control which should be your primary goal.<p>3) People who over eat can suffer from guilt cycles and your weight at any one point can induce more guilt (gaining pounds when you feel you have made even more effort to eat) even though it is not relevant as long as the over-all trend for life-long health is getting to and maintaining an approximate body shape which can fluctuate and still be healthy.<p>4) Being on a diet means coming off a diet.

It also rewards being good at overselling work, although that's a bigger problem in some areas than others.<p>I think people actually are already pretty good at judging research quality on something like ""effort"", or more to the point: how good a scientist is so-and-so? But it requires familiarity with the person over some time, and tends not to scale well. If you ask a scientist about the quality of research of one of their colleagues they've been in the same department with for 10 years, they'll rarely refer to publications, and they often won't even refer to discoveries. Instead, it's inputs rather than outputs to the research process that they evaluate: how well is the person managing his/her lab, how insightful is he/she in picking problems and approaches, how good at mentoring students, how well does he/she really understand where this field is and where it's going / should be going, etc.<p>There is correlation, of course, in that the good scientists most often also produce good results. But at least among the researchers I know, if you have to pick one as the ""real"" one, inputs rather than outputs are it. If you observe someone for a while, you can tell whether they're a good scientist or not, and you can also tell the places where it doesn't correlate with outputs--- someone's been doing everything exactly right on an important problem but just hasn't gotten a break (or maybe <i>did</i> get it, but it came a month after they were scooped by another group), or someone else is kind of mediocre but got lucky with a big result. Neither's the common case, but it's not that rare either; it's not like research is just a crank you turn and results come out. =]<p>I guess the main issue is how to scale it. I think the above is pretty much how people already <i>do</i> make decisions when they're familiar with someone's work. If someone is up for tenure, my impression is that profs in that person's area will rarely even bother looking at publication lists when deciding whether to vote yes/no: after working with the person for 6 years they already have a good idea of whether the person is a good researcher they want to keep. It's mainly the people in other areas (in a large department), or in administrative roles, who seem to have no choice but to use the CV as the main basis of their tenure decision.",1277156348

L2TP/PPTP weren't a big problem though I had to fight to make split tunneling work properly. Juniper SSL VPN flat out did not work at the time though I've heard they released Linux support over the last 18 months or so?<p>There are a few other examples that would be pure personal preference.

I do not agree that the validation done in ASP.NET MVC is a ""killer"", especially since I've hit hard limitations in the first hours of me trying it.<p>In case you're wondering about what limitations I'm talking about ... try building a dynamic forms system that gets stored in the DB (fields, references to validation rules) allowing a  user to build some forms and for another user to supply values for those forms.<p>The only validation system I've seen that's reasonably productive and that works in most cases is the one in Django, but even that is lacking considering you have to add your own code to have client-side validation and keep it DRY (although that happens due to Django's policies, not due to bad design, and really it's not that big of a deal to add something that works well in most cases ... bringing server-side validation to client-side is an easy to solve problem, unless your framework is fucked-up).<p>> <i>Easy deployment as there is only IIS</i><p>You are probably kidding, although I'm happy they finally discovered the virtues of text configuration files.<p>> <i>no decisions about fcgi, mogrel, keeping your processes running, etc</i><p>Not every platform is as fucked-up as Rails ... mod_wsgi for Django (or any wsgi compliant Python framework) just works with no headaches.<p>It takes me 20 minutes flat to manually get an EC2 instance up and running with everything needed. And I can quickly automate that in a way Windows devs cannot begin to dream of.<p>> <i>You've got one of (if not THE ) best IDE's with easy debugging, intellisense</i><p>Sometimes I miss that, but not that much, mostly because I need the flexibility to use the best tool for a certain job, not to mention that sometimes I don't have a choice in the tools I use.<p>That's why I'm using Emacs ... the flexibility I gained made me several times more productive than a clicky-clicky IDE.<p>If you don't believe me, try working with Python from VS.NET, while using pychecker/pylint to automatically check your code (let's say it's a company policy) and to also use ReviewBoard in combination with a Git repository.<p>Or better yet, try debugging with VS a production environment.<p>> <i>some of the best documented API's and code in existence</i><p>In comparison with Django it pales.<p>Not only does it have good documentation, but when it's lacking the clarity of the actual code is breathtaking ... yes, devs using Django are actually looking at its source-code and I have quite a few friends developing on top of ASP.NET ... none are doing that.<p>Maybe it's a cultural thing, maybe it's because ASP.NET is proprietary, the end-result is the same though ... the Django devs I know have intimate knowledge of Django's internal mechanisms, while ASP.NET devs do not.<p>> <i>Is there some missing feature or just sad that he can't be one of the cool kids?</i><p>HN has degraded a lot recently.

1450102,comment,1449799,1449799,0,0,lmkg,,,"Practice. Practice, practice, practice. The most important thing to realize is that math isn't just a body of knowledge, but also the skill of applying that knowledge. Example: Memorizing a bunch of trig identities will not let you integrate crazy trigonometric functions. You need to be able to figure out which identities you ought to apply to push your crazy function into an integrable form. The identities you can look up from a book when you need them. The important skill is applying the identities you have.<p>This ability, to see the direction you need to go from the pieces that you have and the goal you want to achieve, is the most transferable skill that mathematics will give you. And you can only get it from practice. Get actual textbooks, with practice problems. Preferably, get the teacher's edition, or one with the answer to odd-numbered problems in the back so you can check your work. And when you make a mistake, don't just correct it, go back and figure out why you were wrong and why the answer is correct, because that's often one of the most instructive activities you can do.<p>You probably already know that any given level of math builds on knowledge and concepts from previous levels. Depending on the speed of progression, it's often necessary not just to know the preceding knowledge, but to master it. The lower-level stuff has to be downright trivial if you want to focus on higher-level stuff. It's simply not possible to do, e.g., line integrals in the complex plane if you have to stumble through basic algebraic manipulations like canceling variables while you're doing it[1]. The converse of this, is that you often master important math concepts by using them as the foundation for something more abstract, because only then do you see why they were so important.<p>Anyways, enough generalities, time for specific subjects. Geometry isn't very important, but trigonometry becomes important, especially because it's related to exponents which are super-critical. Learn trig. Then, learn linear algebra (matrix maths). Then, find a course or book on discrete mathematics, which usually means intro-level number theory, graph theory, and combinatorics. Calculus is worth picking up at some point. It's not as important to a programmer as to a physicist or engineer, but it is foundational to several other areas, and shows up in the damndest places. Simple single-variable calculus is probably sufficient, and focus on what an integral represents rather than how to compute one. After that, the two interesting paths are analysis (and topology), and algebra.<p>[1] It's a lot like learning a new language in a different alphabet, which is something I'm doing right now. It's really hard to deal with important concepts like characterization and tone when you can barely fit three letters in your head at the same time, much less a whole word (that you have to look up), much less an entire idea.",1277154897

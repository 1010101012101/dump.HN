1816669,comment,1815087,1815675,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I think you're assuming a lot here. Many countries around the world play rugby, from which American Football is derived. The only use of helmets in that sport is for covering players' ears if they stick out and are vulnerable to getting torn. It's just as aggressive as AF, but (preferably) played at something closer to the speed of soccer, without all the committee meetings and personnel changes (which everyone outside the US finds mystifying and dull). Obviously the players are not as big or colliding with such force as a result, but the game isn't any less popular for that; and happily, it's not highly correlated with brain damage (unless you count rugby fans' notorious appetite for beer). In short, you can have sporting machismo for fun and profit without necessarily needing all the players to look like the Hulk.<p><i>Football is America's premier sport, and the Super Bowl is America's most prestigious sporting event.</i><p>The super bowl is certainly a big deal because it all comes down to one match, but I think it might be interesting to aggregate the interest and profits in the World Series of baseball (best of seven games between the top two teams), rather than compare a single baseball game with a single football game. Baseball is arguably a more successful export than American football, and has greater long-term growth potential. Although NFL is about 2x more profitable, and attracts bigger crowds, there are 10 times more baseball games than football games per season, so overall attendance at baseball stadia is actually 5x higher than at football stadia (<a href=""http://www.plunkettresearch.com/Industries/Sports/SportsStatistics/tabid/273/Default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plunkettresearch.com/Industries/Sports/SportsStat...</a>).<p><i>Boxers and MMA fighters knowingly take up a sport where their retired legendary heroes can barely form a coherent sentence after age 50. They know going in they're going to get their brain damaged and they do it anyway, and boxing's not half as prestigious as football here.</i><p>But boxing used to be hugely popular; our greater understanding of the long-term damage which results, and exactly how it results, are IMHO a significant reason for the decline in popularity. When I was a kid Muhammad Ali was a megastar; he may not have made as much money in $ terms as someone like Tiger Woods today, but he was arguably the first globally famous sporting figure. The heavyweight boxing championship was considered a must-see event, like the premier Olympic events or a world cup final. Now, not so much. MMA or ultimate fighting or whatever it's called is well marketed and profitable, but it doesn't have anything like the prestige that boxing used to do. If you stopped 10 people on the street I doubt that more than 1 could tell you who the MMA champion is, whereas anyone over 35 could name some former heavyweight boxing champs.<p>I'd bet $100 that American football will go the same way over the next 40 years. Not because the NFL or even a single NFL team will decide to adopt a more delicate style of play, but because parents are not going to be enthused about the risk of their kids getting brain damage in high school or college while they're aiming for the NFL. Once a player goes pro, football pays so much that they'll probably be able to cover their future medical expenses. But brain injury to a non-pro player has the potential to be just as expensive, and if the injured player never gets near the pro salary then the cost lands back on their family or possibly the taxpayer.<p>Lately the NFL has been marketing itself heavily to women because they consider the male sports audience to be saturated at this point. I think greater female interest in the sport will boost it in the short term, but as more of these fans become parents there will be a correspondingly greater brake on new entrants to the sport.  Personally, I think NFL has already peaked, and can only go downhill from here.",1287683996

I've primarily written in Java and Perl before.<p>Javascript is dynamic language, and I think a lot of it will have some familiarity of python (...well, I think so - I do not know python...). I would recommend to start with ""Object Oriented Javascript"" (Stefanov) from Packt Publishing, rather than the Javascript brick from Oreilly. You get through this book relatively quickly. One quirk of JS is the use of the ""this"" keyword, which you might find being used in a bit oddly ways.<p>HTML will you understand relatively easily as well.

I generally think of a broad idea and probably pseudocode (which can have any syntax I want or create on the fly) which then morphs into a programming language either as I express the complex idea or as I add detail to the scope of the solution.<p>Also, the joke does have a translation to English: ""How do you call an elevator in Spanish?"" ""With your finger."" Expressing yourself is a game of context and expressing an idea is not necessarily a verbatim translation from one language to another.<p>On another note, on the ""to wait"" and ""to hope"" comment, you are right depending on what mannerism the people around. I could very well say ""tengo la esperanza de"" is as much a Translation as ""espero que"". Again proof that context and semantics are more important than language choices themselves.",1287683806

It's essentially a subsidy of  vertical integration.<p>This would make it hard for any b2b company.  you can hire an accountant in house, as an employee (deductible, under your plan)  or you can pay an external firm (say, a firm next door. small business accounting is usually done locally.) to do your taxes (not deductible under your plan, even though the accountant salaries are deductible to the accounting firm, the accounting firm fees you paid would not be deductible for you.)<p>This would make it doubly hard for those of us who spend most of their revenue on non-salary expenses and who are primarily b2b businesses.   The thing is, I pay more for power/rackspace/bandwidth than I pay for salary, and that disparity will only increase as I scale up.    For me, it'd be a double whammy, as not only would I get taxed on what I pay for power, (so I'd have to raise my rates)  but my customers would have to pay those higher rates out of post-tax money.<p>This would probably be incentive enough to move my corporation abroad or shut down...

The Microsoft monoculture leaches out into everything to do with the Windows platform. The obvious example would be something like Team Foundation Server - it's as if Microsoft as an entity can't imagine software being developed outside of a complex corporate structure that requires ""lifecycle management"". The fact that Microsoft are so deeply engaged with their developer community only strengthens the effect of this monoculture.

1816367,comment,1814596,1815900,0,0,jedbrown,,,"Yes, however the algorithms are such that failure cannot be made strictly local.  For example, when solving a stiff PDE, there is unavoidable and quite complex global communication at every time step (indeed, within the nonlinear solves required in each time step).  There is no hope of ""continuous local checkpointing"" or the like because the program state is changing to the tune of gigabytes per second per node.<p>The most common response is to perform global checkpoints often enough that hardware failure is not too expensive, but infrequently enough that your program performance doesn't suffer too much.  Bear in mind that our jobs are not normally hitting disk heavily, so frequent checkpointing could easily cost an order of magnitude.  When hardware failure occurs, the entire global job is killed and it is restarted from the last checkpoint.  There are libraries (e.g. BLCR) that integrate with MPI implementations and resource managers for checkpoint, restart, and migration.<p>Note that it is not possible to locally reconstruct the state of the process that failed because there just isn't enough information unless you store all incoming messages, which can easily be a continuous gigabyte per second per node.  Even if you had a fantastic storage system that gave you ring storage with bandwidth similar to the network, local reconstruction wouldn't do much good because the rest of the simulation could not continue until the replacement node had caught up, so the whole machine would be idle until during this time.  If you have another job waiting to run, you could at least get something done, but the resource management implications of such a strategy are not a clear win.<p>So if hardware failure becomes so frequent that global checkpointing is too costly, the only practical recourse is to compute everything redundantly.  Nobody in scientific computing is willing to pay double to avoid occasionally having to restart from the last checkpoint, so this strategy has not taken off (though there are prototype implementations).",1287680502

But what you are proposing is basically some amendments to classic dating sites, nothing about the very premise of this startup helps.<p>And honestly, I believe the idea of having friends writing your profile is very flawed. Maybe it's my own personality, but I cannot see that happening to me or any of my friends.<p>Online dating is never going to be perfect because no dating is ever going to be perfect. But roughly speaking, everything is already invented. Dare I say, pay sites do the bulk of the filtering by having people pay (mostly us males), and that just works and finances the site. As simple as it is. And this is why they still exist.<p>So yeah, you can add a few elements, maybe some enhancements to traditional dating sites but the basic mechanics are just that: everybody self-promoting and looking for other people, following their basic instincts. How much can you direct that to be more effective? probably not that much more.",1364601485

My wife and I were on the same law forum and exchanged messages (not romantic, more like ""you're so wrong about x, y, z"") a few times before we met in real life in a related context (she was at my law school interviewing for admission). Several other marriages and engagements came out of the same batch of people on the same site, from city group meet-ups. Alcohol + a group of people comfortable with each other because they at least vaguely know each other online + a group of people with shared interests is a great way to spark relationships.<p>I don't think online dating is perfect as it's currently structured, but it has a lot of potential. I'd picture something like a dating site where you couldn't search for people ad-hoc, but which interest-specific discussion forums could link into. You'd create a profile, but only be found by people who reached out through some interest-specific site.

Other than that, it seems like a disaster... obviously it's personal preference, but it's a lot easier to deal with security and data models when you're using them the way they were built to be used (1 person to 1 account.)<p>From your description, it sounds like you really have two accounts, but you just do all your purchasing from one.<p>Sharing a free email account just seems like an exercise in frustration. The whole usage model for email - inbox, notifications, read/unread, filing, deleting - is designed on the presumption that the messages are being consumed by a single individual. I've always viewed sharing an email account as something that old folks do because it maps to their model of a physical mailbox, or because they're too feeble to maintain / login to multiple accounts.<p>Having worked for Amazon, I suspect you're not getting the benefit of a lot of their recommendation technology if you're sharing an account.

What sort of being takes this role in primate behavioral biology?

What would happen if you took an alpha male chimpanzee, and by modifying various visual and other socially significant sensory markers, you made him seem to be a member of a different group? I'm sure the result wouldn't be harmonious. What's more, what if you did something analogous to sending a couple of policemen in a cruiser through some neighborhood? It would be analogous to a couple of strange young chimpanzee males invading another group's territory.<p>There is the concept of community policing, where officers are encouraged to be an integral part of the community they are policing.

So he knows he's pushing something counterintuitive here. Where's the evidence he's marshalled?

My area does not.<p><i>My non-tuition expenditures total under $700 a month including food and rent. For two of my three years in college, I did not have a job.</i><p>I checked, non-tuition rates at all of the schools in my state cost ~$800/mo for dorms. The dorms appear to be single occupancy with no affordance for a married couple, they do not allow year round occupancy, that means we'd be out $1600 a month for worse living conditions and still have to figure out what to do during summer break.<p>That being said, we did have an opportunity to rent a room in somebody's house and saved $100 a month (sublet rooms in my area run between $600-700/mo), the tradeoff was around 2 more hours a day in transport time by car + fuel costs. Doing the math and the money worked out about the same, but then we'd have to spend more time on the road instead of working or studying, and we'd have less privacy. We seriously considered the local homeless shelter, but they charge $20 a night per person, or $1200 a month for the both of us to be itinerant.<p>I did a breakdown somewhere else in this thread on what our costs were, it was only because of some grants and a few student loans that we could even pay for school at all.<p>One thing we didn't expect was that it would take two years for my wife to get her work permit. But 9/11 happened and fucked up immigration royally for a long while. It meant she couldn't work at all during that time. Once she started working things eased up quite a bit.<p><i>but you should seriously consider how many of your expenses were/are necessary.</i><p>So what was unnecessary?<p>At the time we had no car payments to make (the vehicles were owned outright), food was the cheapest garbage we could find in the ""discontinued"" bin at the dollar store (literally), clothes were what we started with (I didn't purchase a single article of clothing for 2 years), our #1 expense was housing, which short of couch hoping for years on end there simply wasn't anything we could do about. We had no furniture, at all. We didn't even have dishes for most of the first year! We both ate on around $5-7/day. There literally was no other expense that was possible to cut by our reckoning.<p><i>Nothing</i> makes you think about what every...single...thing...costs than being poor. We even knew, down to the item, and sometimes to the ounce (since different packaging formats make direct comparisons hard), what we could buy for cheaper at the grocery store vs. the dollar store. We reused cooking oil in an old coffee can I took from my work when it was empty. A package of instant noodles and 20 ketchup packages made 4 servings. We used to go to our local grocery and argue with the manager when the sell-by date on canned goods got too close so we could get case of canned green beans for a dollar, then eat only green beans for a week. I can tell you that a package of one day expired hotdogs and 20 more ketchup packages can make an extravagant stir fry that lasts for four meals. Add half a chopped onion and it becomes 4 star. It's not possible to eat cheaper than that without going completely free.<p>We didn't have cable, a land-line or cell phones (I used AOL and other free internet CDs and a long phone wire to one of my neighbor's land-lines if I needed to get online at home, or just used the school's computer lab when it was open).<p>We actually sold one of our cars during the second February because there weren't enough work hours in the short month to both pay rent and buy groceries.<p>What where was the extravagant and unnecessary thing that we could have cut?<p><i>For two of my three years in college, I did not have a job.</i><p>And yet tuition, rent and food materialized?",1364600073

5463606,comment,5463210,5463210,18,0,malandrew,,,"You're completely right, people are lazy, but online dating is also way more work than it has to be.<p>Women receive so many messages that it becomes overwhelming and too much work and men try sending earnest messages for a little while and then concede that it's basically a numbers game. These two phenomena are self-reinforcing. The more messages women receive, the less likely they are to respond. The more messages a man doesn't get a response to the more likely they are to put less effort into their messages. If you solve this problem, you effectively solve attrition rate in dating sites.<p>If you look at an old inbox full of sent of received messages for a man versus a women, you'll notice something interesting. The woman's inbox will be full of avatars next to almost all the messages. Men don't delete or suspend accounts. Now if you look at the inbox of the men on the other hand you'll notice that more and more of the messages have the default avatar next to the name as you move back in time in the inbox. This is because many women become totally overwhelmed by the number of messages, the quantity of them that are vulgar, etc.<p>I've talked to a bunch of people about this (because I'm one of those few people that has no problem talking about online dating because like you I think it is the future) and the conclusion I've come to that many people agree with is that online dating needs the equivalent of the spam button in many email inboxes. However instead of saying the words ""Mark as spam"", there should be two buttons, one that says ""Mark as did not read my profile"" and one that says ""Flag as vulgar or offensive"". The first button is to be used every time a women (or a man) receives a message where someone sends a one line message with no content specific to the recipient or any message which is obviously cookie cutter (cut & paste job)[0] and the second should be used whenever the sender is overtly sexual or mean.<p>Every time these buttons are used it should impact a score on both the sender and the recipient. For the sender, they're ""doesn't read profiles"" score should go up and for the recipient that used the button, their ""cares that senders don't read and consider their profile"" score should go up. The same goes for vulgarity/offensive content. The balance of these two numbers should determine if the message makes it through to the recipients email inboxes at all in the future. You could even warn senders when their score starts getting too bad, like ""This message will not be delivered to this user because you've been flagged as someone who doesn't consider the content of user's profiles when crafting a message"" or ""This user only receives messages from people who take time to craft a personal message"". If the sender then goes back and significantly modifies their message before sending again (verified via a text diff and possibly the passage of time), then send it through. This time however, if that message gets flagged by the recipient, then it counts very negatively towards their score.<p>If you use an approach like this you should be able to keep the inboxes of females (and desirable males) with a high signal to noise ratio. This will greatly improve their experience and lead them to respond to more messages and not get so fed up with the bullshit messages that they either quit responding or quit the site entirely.<p>[0] The only counterpoint to this are messages that achieve the Forer Effect[1]. One of my friends has crafted some particularly generic messages (his own admission) that presses all the right buttons just like horoscopes texts do and he gets a pretty solid response rate despite the fact that those messages are just cut and pasted. He's even frustrated that his well thought out personal messages often perform worse than his generic ones that play to a recipients own positive self image. TBH, I'd like to take Forer's original text, and modify it for OkCupid to see how it performs. Besides crafting the message, I'd need to figure out how to produce an acceptably generic profile that still conveys enough authority for the recipient to think the fake profile has the authority to make those statements/judgements.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect</a>",1364599974

That means that two rational agents whose knowledges are the same must hold the same beliefs.  More practically, two persons having the same <i>relevant</i> knowledge about any given question should believe the same answer (the difficulty here is to sort out what's relevant).  Second, agents generally don't have the same background knowledge.  Nothing stops us for knowing different relevant information about any given subject.  So of course we won't hold the same beliefs.<p>Fuzzy.  Ah, fuzzy the more I look at it, the less sense it makes.  Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as ""half truth"".

If I say the bottle is more than 75% full with probability 84%, then I'm 16% right if it really is only half full.

The industrial era gave everyone a mediocre income through repetitive work. The technological era brings much more income volatility and (when it reaches maturity, probably late in this century) will inevitably require a Basic Income. It's about concavity versus convexity: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/gervais-macleod-9-convexity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/gervais-macle...</a><p>Concave work is that where the difference between top-notch stuff and mediocrity is small-- maybe 1.2x or 1.5x. Convex work means that excellence is so far superior over mediocrity (10x, maybe more) that mediocre work has almost no value.<p>What we do is convex because we automate all the concave processes. If the work can be commoditized, a good programmer will automate it away. That leaves the hard, creative stuff. So we have a convex input-output profile. That's part of the fun-- you can add 20% more value by being just a little better-- but it's also pretty terrifying to realize how close we are to a ""natural"" celebrity economy where a few stars are extremely well-paid and most get nothing.<p>We, however, have a few things that play differently. First, no one except a superior programmer (who become rare as one moves along) can evaluate us. Most CEOs are not only in the dark themselves, but unable to evaluate a CTO, who's unable to evaluate VP/Eng, who's unable to evaluate programmers. It's a classic Design Paradox. I think it's pretty random whether a non-technical CEO gets a decent CTO. Second, even <i>we</i> are in the dark about what makes a great programmer. Is it talent, or experience? Obviously, it's a mix of both... but the rarity of great programmers suggests that either few have the talent, or quality work experience is thin on the ground. We're unlike most people in the corporate world in that we deeply want to get better at our jobs (independent of being more rewarded) and yet the path to that is <i>very</i> opaque. How do you become a great programmer? Get great projects. How does one do that? It's not easy.<p>The complete opacity of programmer skill and development helps and hurts us.

The <i>complete</i> phrase is actually <i>""A few bad apples will spoil the barrel""</i>.  This is to say that if you do not take an aggressive stance towards weeding out all of the bad apples, the rot will spread like an infection (rotting apples will release ethylene gas which acts as a ripening agent, accelerating the rot of nearby apples) and corrupt <i>all</i> of the apples.<p>So if we trust our apples:cops metaphor then what we are really saying is that if we overlook the a few bad cops for any significant amount of time, before we know it, <i>all</i> cops will be bad.  Obviously crooked cops don't release ethylene gas in significant quantities... instead the Blue Wall is the most commonly cited mechanism of transmission.<p>I like this idiom.",1364598919

Consider if those things had been paid for out of the tax base,  thus putting a net positive back into the system.<p>For sake of comparison, a few friends of mine from where I grew up <i>could't</i> stick with the living hell of it all and didn't finish college (those that tried) for a wide variety of reasons (very few of those reasons were laziness), I paid around the same in taxes each year over the last five years than any of them made in salary during the same period. They're effectively making the same wage working today as they made in their early 20s, thus greatly lowering the tax base that they <i>could</i> have provided back into the system.<p>I can't say that a single pivotal act of state-sponsored charity would have turned their lives around and made them into vastly more productive citizens, but a few dollars here and a discount there <i>could</i> have been all it took. Who knows?<p>I think my point is that putting it in terms of who ""owes"" what, is probably not the right model. If the system isn't dysfunctional, you can trivially calculate what the average family of n requires, and make sure that the working adults in that family, working a full-time job, can earn enough to make that if working full-time is what they choose to do. A medical surprise or an auto repair or what have you <i>shouldn't</i> be something that derails their entire lives.<p>In my case, we were both living spartan, but comfortable, lives after college for around $40k per year combined (my first job after graduating). This is with a $900/mo apartment, one car payment, and no children. We ate out once or twice a week, and cooked in the rest. We had enough to clothe ourselves professionally and keep the lights on when we wanted them (not when we needed them), not eat absolute garbage three meals a day, and a few hours at the end of the day in ""free-time"". It works out to about $20/hr.<p>And turns out that the literature shows that in my area, a living wage for 2 adults is shown to be $19.25 [1]<p>Now there's an argument that there should be jobs that <i>aren't</i> living wage. Unskilled, extremely low end jobs, like fast food restaurants, they should pay enough to get people into the work force, but motivate them to move up and above that. It's an interesting bit of social engineering. But it has a problem that's not always overcome. That's because the minimum wage is like a speed limit. It's the default setting unless some other factor causes you to deviate from it like a lack of a hiring pool.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://livingwage.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://livingwage.mit.edu/</a>",1364598198

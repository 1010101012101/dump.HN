There are designated areas in layout. For example this is where main content goes, this is a navigation area, this is a subnav area and so on. You slice it up, you code html+css for each - this one is stretchy, this one has borders like that from css or from photoshop, background this like that... I'm doing it all now without SVG. In fact I could do it with PS->slice html output, but I don't because fixing html+css output is more work than straight coding from scratch and fetching/cropping images out from PS as I need them.<p>Thus, system obviously works.

1524616,comment,1524019,1524019,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"A. Fewer words, more action or pictures. You've heard this already.<p>B. Wordsmithing. You need a copy editor, with a degree in English or its moral equivalent, to go over every line of this with you. Let's take apart just the third sentence:<p><i>Probably depends on how good of a designer you are!</i><p>""How good of a [X]"" is a very awkward phrase in print. It might work in very casual spoken English, but in print it looks amateurish. Starting a sentence with ""probably"" is likewise too casual. Your customer base is made of designers. They often care about such details.<p>You should also consider avoiding the exclamation point. Heed the words of Elmore Leonard: ""You are allowed no more than two or three exclamation points per 100,000 words of prose.""<p>Now, having marginally improved the sentence by changing it to something like:<p><i>It probably depends on how talented a designer you are.</i><p>...you should delete this sentence altogether, because it is an <i>awful</i> sales pitch. You are, literally, questioning the skill of your prospective customer. Let me translate this opening:<p><i>If people aren't paying you $200 to $500 to design simple things, you probably suck!</i><p>Guess what? Your prospective customer is probably <i>not</i> currently being paid $200 to $500 for custom Facebook pages. If your customer already knew how to build these pages, he or she would not be shopping for your product. So your opening pitch can be further distilled to:<p><i>Dear customer: You suck!</i><p>Ouch. Get the whole thing off the page and replace it with something more like this:<p><i>Customers will pay you $200 to $500 for custom-designed Facebook pages, and you can build them in minutes with this tool.</i><p>Only with fewer words.<p>C. For a product that offers to simplify a complicated process, the home page looks awfully complicated. Too much technical jargon. Don't write things like this:<p><i>Forget about learning XFBML, FBML, FBJS, FQL.</i><p>You are trying to convince your customer that they need not learn or even <i>think</i> about these acronyms. So don't name-drop them. That's like trying to sell a Caribbean vacation by saying:<p><i>Forget about sharks, food poisoning, skin cancer, or pickpockets.</i><p>Make the prose on the page be as easy and soothing as the product is meant to be. Speak to your audience. Don't use any technical terms except those that your customers need to know: ""HTML"" and ""CSS"". If a subset of your customers needs to know about the XFBML, put it in the FAQ.<p>D. The name. I hate to have to say it, it's like picking on someone's kids, but ""A Plan Of Attack"" is not a good product name. It doesn't suggest Facebook, it doesn't suggest design, it doesn't sound like the name of an application or product, it contains too many words, and it starts with an ""A"" which will turn your word-of-mouth recommendations into an Abbott and Costello sketch:<p><pre><code>  A: ""What should I use for my simple Facebook pages?""
  B: ""'A Plan Of Attack'""
  A: ""Which plan of attack?""
  B: ""No, that's a spreadsheet. Use 'A Plan Of Attack'""
  A: ""Did you even hear my question?""
  B: ""Third base!""

E. A/B testing. Clearly you should not accept my word for any of this. I have no idea how to sell your product. All I have are hypotheses.

""Read the code"" is not a good answer when time is a factor.  I write obnoxious amounts of documentation as I write systems.  I used to get called out for it, until I would be out, a problem would occur, and then someone else was easily able to take care of it by reading said documentation.<p>The main time waster for me is being told to ""maintain"" a system instead of refactoring it.  A great example is a recent project I've finished up.  Years were spent trying to create bandaids for major design deficiencies.  They never solved the problem since there were fundamental design flaws.  It was slow.  It produced only somewhat useful results.  It required lots of time and effort for maintenance.<p>After much hemming and hawing (and the reality that the system hadn't delivered its expected value after 3 years) I was given the green light to rewrite it.  I spent a month validating the design, and 2 1/2 months rewriting it and putting it into production alongside the existing parallel system.  The new old system will be turned off in 2 or 3 weeks.<p>Benefits?<p>* It produces correct results for downstream apps.  This item alone made the effort worthwhile.  Everything else is simply gravy.<p>* As a result of the first item, we now have reverse engineered another vendor's feed with uncanny accurcy.  We can now ""front-run"" them, reducing our latency to act in the market.  We can also cancel a subscription that has a $200,000/yr price tag.  We can also decommission that system freeing up hardware.<p>* The time is takes to load new data from the vendor was reduced from 50 minutes to 4.  It now scales perfectly linear with new data volume, instead of ever-increasing over time.  It can also still be faster (down to ~3 minutes), but those improvements need to be made by another group.<p>* Since its faster, and has very little overhead, the server has gone from burdened to idle.  We can now have other systems take advantage of this great hardware (16-core, 64GB of memory, FusionIO scratch space, very fast SAN hardware).<p>* The storage footprint of the data warehouse was reduced by 50%.<p>* On top of the storage reduction, replication to our disaster recovery site was reduced by an additional 70% (on top of the initial 50% from reduced data volume) because of how the data is structured.<p>* Source code reduction?  85% fewer lines.  It is now ruthlessly simple.<p>* Maintenance?  It now auto-recovers.  Untrained operations staff just perform 2 automated steps to recover from 99% of problems that we expect to occur in production.",1279399224

This is universally found in browsers, but you won't find this in Node.js (a server-side javascript environment using V8). Conversely, Node makes available Buffers which you won't find in any browser.<p>I think the best way to answer your question is to identify in the respective environments which version of ECMAScript they claim to support. Various versions of each browser support different versions of ECMAScript, or such as Internet Explorer where earlier versions supported a variant called JScript that didn't always tie directly to the published standards.<p>The wikipedia page is a good place to start, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript</a>.",1279399211

Then any dynamic stuff I build as widgets with either Dojo or jQuery depending on how complex the site it. Both toolkits have API's for calling JSON services and building UI widgets, but Dojo provides a more robust API for developing complex applications.<p>I usually create a Javascript file per-page that is outside of the frameworks that I call ""pagename""_controller.js I put all of the controller code in this file and general make it procedural. So this file will put widgets on the page, glue communication between widgets, and generally act as the view controller for that page.<p>The controllers as wells as the server side services, I generally develop internally, because they require the most application knowledge. But if it is a huge product, I usually define the requirements for the widgets and sub them out.<p>The nice part is in the end, the pages are pure HTML, CSS and all of the Javascript is external to the HTML and CSS so it allows the designers to work in a pure technology that they are comfortable with. It also allows me to sub out work very easily because all of the technologies are well encapsulated. I can sub out a widget by just defining the requirements for that widget and the input and output calls. They do not need to understand the whole system rather just their box. As well my designers are able to take those widgets and drop them on the page and I am able to wire it all up. It is very clean, while maintaining the ability to rapidly develop and application.<p>Finally, I use JAX-RS and JPA to build server side services.

So here goes.<p>I used to print t-shirts. I learned the entire t-shirt printing process from studying online. Not just hobby stuff, I actually grew to a warehouse with professional-grade equipment.<p>I decided I would try and create a website for my t-shirt printing business.<p>1) I built a complete back-end php/mysql system to manage and process orders. My dream was to have it fully automated on-line but that was pretty damned hard. So I just used it internally.<p>2) I decided to make an ecommerce website that sold my own t-shirt designs. Thinking I could design, produce, and fulfill tshirt orders from my own custom-made ecommerce system (not to mention actually marketing it online to you know ... get sales) is pretty damned hard.<p>3) A while later I realized it would be great if I could sell custom ""tackle twill"" hoodies online because most people don't realize how insanely great a tackle twill hoody can look. Everyone is used to seeing boring solid color College type hoodies. (i also did embroidery). I set out on building this great system that let customers design their hoodies online from a set of pre-defined fonts, colors, patterns, and apparel choices. It was GREAT for the level of developer I was at the time, but needless to say... it wasn't that great. Never finished it because it was too complex and not nearly on par with the competition.<p>I was doing all this as a hobby since I spent all my time printing shirts.
Then after a couple years I decided to go full-time web developing.<p>4) Took a year to <i>seriously</i> learn how to code, learned kohana and jquery and built a website that created websites. Pretty much like weebly, but a thousand times more complex (which is really bad!). It works pretty well and powers <a href=""http://larasgift.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://larasgift.com</a> (I have a couple of clients). But all in all, making websites for people is a huge pain in the ass.<p>5) Created a website that was to be an improvement to wikipedia. It is/was a cool idea, but obviously who the hell am i kidding with that idea ... (how do i make money?)<p>6) Created <a href=""http://pluspanda.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pluspanda.com</a> because through building the weebly clone, I realized local businesses don't really <i>need</i> whole entire websites. The internet is about word-of-mouth, referrals, and ... testimonials!  (that's still live, just having trouble finding an acute market)<p>Here I learned that my coding was getting better but my productivity was suffering. Too much time wasted on stupid things. So after some deliberation I commited to learning Rails. I couldn't get Rails to work in Windows so what the hell, installed Ubuntu and become a command-line zen-master.<p>So now I'm riding the Rails on Ubuntu, source-controlling it with git so that i can deploy via capistrano and loving life chilling with the Linode production server.<p>7) <a href=""http://tastyink.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tastyink.com</a>  was my first rails app that I built to learn Rails. I think this is a SOLID idea that I'm still working on but it's too complex of an idea to sell so I figured I needed a more dead simple IN to these local businesses which led to ...<p>8) <a href=""http://aplanofattack.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aplanofattack.com</a><p>These are the main projects that I've actually commited to trying, there are a handful of other projects not worth mentioning and of course freelance work every now and then.<p><pre><code>  The point is ......

I know that is sound advice. I know it! I just don't think of it as abandonment. I think of it as refinement. All of my projects have actually been perfectly inline with a core concept: Helping local businesses leverage the interent. It started at as some massively and painfully overcomplex website building engine 2000 (never make your apps complex!!) and slowly, slowly, I've iterated to very core and very simple ""services"" that business can use and understand quickly and easily.<p>I'm getting there!<p>Hope this helps.",1279398330

My original goal was just to separate work space and home space visually for a professional appearance, but a few people commented they didn't know it was my apartment at first. It's surprising how possible this is to do - the extra couple hundred bucks to between Copley and Hynes-ICA instead of out of the city made a lot more people drop by when I invited them.<p>Then stock the place with enough coffee, tea, energy drinks, water, bread, cans of tuna, cans of soup, whatever that's fast and doesn't go bad so you don't have to go out if you're in a good flow.

It's just something I've dipped into to solve a particular problem - largely through just grabbing other code/dissecting existing stuff.  Then I got hold of jQuery and never learned about the underlying language.  This was great to catch up on the basics.",1279396964
1524534,comment,1523702,1524506,0,0,jashkenas,,,"Compiling a single language into JavaScript source code as well as C or C++ is going to be one hell of a trick. I think it'll be very difficult to keep the semantics the same, without resorting to running the equivalent of a JavaScript interpreter inside of your C++, but I wish you the best of luck with it.<p>If you'd like to discuss the implementation, feel free to drop by #coffeescript on freenode. But to give you the rough outline -- the compiler is made up of (in order), a Lexer, Rewriter, Parser, and AST of Nodes. The lexer creates the tokens, the rewriter rewrites the stream of tokens, disambiguating parses and allowing for optional syntax, the parser generates the AST of nodes, and then ""compile()"" is called on the root node, and walks down the tree, compiling the JavaScript string recursively.<p>For the parser, I'm using the excellent Jison parser generator for JavaScript, in LALR(1) mode. The only really unorthodox part of this is the Rewriter. It's not kosher to munge a token stream before parsing it -- but it's removed a <i>ton</i> of complexity from the grammar to not ever have to handle the syntactical edge cases, and to have them resolved in advance. All of the source is annotated, so here's some links:<p>* Jison: <a href=""http://github.com/zaach/jison"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/zaach/jison</a><p>* Lexer: <a href=""http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/docs/lexer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/docs...</a><p>* Rewriter: <a href=""http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/docs/rewriter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/docs...</a><p>* Grammar: <a href=""http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/docs/grammar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/docs...</a>",1279396960

Just as those saying that they get better reception from the iPhone 4, or saying nothing at all like or are at least indifferent to the antenna design.<p>It seems that many critics of the walled garden approach as well as the antenna design have a hard time realizing (or conveniently forget) that those not complaining loudly aren't necessarily mindless drones who buys anything with an Apple logo on it.<p>So in my mind, I'd say that there are huge amounts of intelligent, reasoning individuals who are using the iPhone 4 at the moment who like the phone as it is.

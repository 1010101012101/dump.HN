651183,comment,650370,650443,0,0,dflock,,,"The Day One Keynote from this years Google I/O conference covers all this html5 stuff very well and demonstrates that this is all available right now, if you pretend that Microsoft doesn't exist. They demo the Firefox 3.5 stuff, and they also demo an internal test version of YouTube that just uses HTML5 <video> and no plugins, which looks awesome. Dailymotion already have one of these: <a href=""http://blog.dailymotion.com/2009/05/27/watch-videowithout-flash/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.dailymotion.com/2009/05/27/watch-videowithout-fl...</a><p>Firefox 3.5 is coming out very soon and auto-update means that your can expect 80%+ of Firefox users to have updated within a few months. Firefox 2 usage is now practically zero, for example. Safari is in the same boat and also supports most of the same HTML 5 stuff that FF3.5 does, as does Chrome. Most of the cool bits of HTML5 should be widely available by the end of the year: video & audio tags, local storage, web worker threads, etc... You can start to rely on this stuff being available by the end of the year, if you pretend that Microsoft doesn't exist.<p>The CSS and javascript frameworks that are rapidly maturing (like YUI, jQuery, Dojo etc..) have really eased my browser support burden over the last year or two. I can now rapidly code something up using YUI reset-fonts-grids, add fancy effects with jQuery and have it work first time cross browser, from IE6 to Chrome. Using these tools has made cross browser dev. time plummet. Older browsers are slowly fading in usage and development cost, which is excellent news. There are other tools like Google Web Toolkit (GWT - which was used to build the Google Wave UI, amongst other things) which are more comprehensive still and introduce a different, browser agnostic, way of developing web apps. These tools really help you to pretend that Microsoft doesn't exist.<p>In addition, I think the adoption of the multiprocess model for web browsers which Chrome is leading the charge on, along with IE8 (and Mozilla are talking about it), is going to cause a bit of a shakedown in the plugins space. With plugins running in a different process, people will finally find out how often they crash. Once people are visibly shown that 50%+ of what used to be (masked as) browser crashes are actually plugin crashes (mostly flash), then I think attitudes may change. It will certainly put extra pressure on plugin vendors to fix their busted crap, anyway. People often underestimate the power of simple things like this, just shining a light on a previously hidden problem can often make it shrivel away.<p>The elephant in the room is obviously Microsoft, who are far more interested in pushing their proprietary Silverlight plugin, so that they can shift more Visual Studio licences, then in any of this other stuff. They've amply demonstratetd with the extended undeath of IE6 that they hate and fear web applications, don't know how to respond to them and would far rather purposefully cause the whole web to stagnate forever, than see web applications become successful. Hopefully we can succeed in spite of them, or gain momentum and drag them along anyway, kicking and screaming.<p>Google pitched Wave at IO as a 'killer app.' for HTML5 - something cool and useful to drive adoption. Everything that I've seen leads me to believe that this might well work. Google have a really deep understanding of the web and know that everything that's ever really succeeded on the web has been both open and distributed, so they've built Wave that way.<p>Either way, it's a pretty exciting time to be doing web development! If you haven't watched any of the stuff from this years Google IO, then you really should at least watch the keynotes:<p><a href=""http://video.google.com/videosearch?oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=google+io+2009&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=g84vSu3wHcvRjAfk0cWXCw&sa=X&oi=video_result_group&resnum=4&ct=title#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videosearch?oe=UTF-8&sourceid=na...</a>",1244649499

Unfortunately, it describes very specifically how <i>not</i> to verify an PKCS RSA signature, perpetuating a mistake that screwed over browser vendors a couple years back:<p><a href=""http://www.matasano.com/log/558/public-key-signature-forgery-collected/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com/log/558/public-key-signature-forgery...</a><p>To wit: you verify specifically cannot look at the SHA-1 hash at the end of an RSA block and compare it to your own hash, because there are hundreds of zillions of other RSA blocks that can result from the RSA algorithm that could contain a SHA-1 block of an attacker's choosing.<p>Vendors learned the hard way that to verify an RSA signature, you have to reconstruct the entire m block you'd expect to see, and byte compare it to the entire ""decrypted"" m block from the certificate.<p>Crypto sucks.",1244649456

651178,comment,650914,651042,0,0,brl,,,"The relative cost of the symmetric bulk encryption algorithms (RC4 vs AES here) is irrelevant compared to the expense of the key exchange/agreement and authentication.<p>The first ciphersuite uses the most common option where the server sends a certificate containing an RSA public key and the client chooses a random number, encrypts it with this key, and sends the encrypted value to the server.  The server then decrypts this value with the private half of the key and derives the session keys from it.  The expense of this decryption increases with the length of the RSA modulus.<p>The second ciphersuite uses ephemeral diffie-hellman where both sides choose a random number, and then exchange them.  In order to accomplish this securely, the server must at least provide a certificate with an RSA key that supports signing (and signature verification) so that the client can verify that the diffie-hellman parameter received from the server has not been tampered with.<p>The DH parameter sent from the client to the server needs to be checked out too, and there are two ways this can be accomplished.  If the server certificate contains a second RSA key which is marked as suitable for encryption, then the client can simply encrypt with this key as in the simple RSA key exchange described above.  If this encryption key does not exist, then TLS provides a crazy way that the handshake can still succeed:<p>1) The server generates a temporary RSA key pair (very expensive)<p>2) The server signs the public half of the key pair with the RSA signing key in the certificate, and sends it to the client.<p>3) The client uses this key to encrypt the diffie-hellman value to send to the server.<p>When the diffie-hellman parameters have been exchanged the server must perform an RSA private-key operation to either decrypt the client value or verify the signature on it.  This has the same cost as in the first type of key exchange and depends again on the length of the RSA key.  After verifying the client value, the server must complete the DH protocol which requires an expensive modular exponentiation which is roughly as expensive as an RSA operation.<p>So no matter what, the second option is going to perform worse than the first option.  The real reason though that the server probably rejected the second ciphersuite is because no certificate was available with an RSA signing key needed to complete the protocol.",1244649395

My latest ""freelance stint"" has just recently passed the one year mark. In between I've had full-time jobs for people who eventually became steady freelance clients. So that's my background.<p>Until recently, I had seen a huge drop off in requests for proposals and the few I did get were dead ends. In hindsight, this started happening during the early winter of last year. But in the last few months I've been picking up more odd jobs so on that front, at least in the short-term, things seems to be getting better.<p>I haven't had to go out and actively seek new clients in quite awhile because I've put together a steady stable of recurring clients. Most of my client base is in the professional sports field and even in down economic times, teams still need to keep their websites up and running. So that's my ""secret"" to freelance success in a bad economy: have good clients in stable industries.<p>Aside from freelance web dev work, I've also put together a decent network of sites earning money through advertising. At this time last year those sites were on pace to make a respectable amount of money each year. It wasn't a living wage but some months it came awfully damn close. Since the economy went to the dump I've seen a huge drop off in revenue from these sites. Some earn 50% less now than they did at this time last year. This income was, for lack of a better term, unnecessary for me to pay my bills and live so while it's a bummer I can live without it.<p>This was a bit rambling but that's my experience so far with the poor economy as a freelance web developer.",1244646809

In straight-and-level flight, if you go any faster, the extra drag will slow you down. If you reduce your thrust from your engines, you will slow down and lose altitude.<p>The problem comes about if you enter into any unusual attitudes, which is certainly possible in severe turbulence. The most important part would be a safe recovery to straight and level flight. An unusual attitude can put you in a situation where you overspeed the aircraft (e.g. nosedive). Above the maneuvering speed of the aircraft, you must be very careful to regain control without overstressing the airframe.[1] If your speed sensor(s) are giving you or the autopilot faulty readings, it would be very difficult to know the safest way to regain control of the aircraft after being put into an unusual attitude due to turbulence.<p>[1] American Airlines Flight 587 crash (NY, 2001) taught us that even below the manuevering speed of the aircraft, the airframe can be overstressed due to dynamic loads from pilot control inputs.",1244646802

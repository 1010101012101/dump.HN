I guess I can tell you what dun work and what you can avoid it in your local city.<p>- I failed to address the supply and demand issue. When I first my biz, I know I have a pretty decent products, I'm sure your local business has too. The issue just no one is buying it from me, either it is because I'm not working close enough with my regional partners/government, etc.. or I'm not exactly talking to the people who need my products. \nIdea: You can start a simple directory listing the local business, products and contacts, much like Angie's List. make it available in print-on-demand, pdf format, etc.<p>- I failed to act swiftly. It is a cut throat business really, if you see a business opportunities, you really need to act now and monetize it. If not, someone bigger and larger will come in and take it from you. You probably need a well tined process to get things out quickly.<p>- I failed to create the market. If things dun quite work out, it is important than to create a market in itself.

Depth First Search (function argument- DFS)\n   2. Iterative Depth First Search (function argument- IDFS)\n   3. A* - Heuristic: Path Cost Incurred (function argument- PATH)\n   4. A* - Heuristic: Minimum Spanning Tree heuristic (function argument- MST)\n   5. (Extra Credit 25  points ) Create and implement a heuristic equal to or better than MST<p>Second project:\nIn this project we implement a decision tree induction algorithm in Lisp.<p>I had played around with lisp before this point and found it fascinating. I approached these projects with excitement. But even with 8 years of serious programming experience, I could not for the life of me solve these problems in lisp. My problems included:<p>1. Knowing exactly what methods I wanted to call and use and either\n    a. Not being able to find them in any reference I found online, or\n    b. Finding out that they don't exist, and you have to write them yourself, or\n    c. Finding them and shaking my head at how ridiculously they were named.\n2. Not being able to read the code I had just written.\n3. Not being able to debug.\n4. Finding that manipulating common data structures like hash tables is a total chore.<p>Eventually I gave up. I had spent about two hours trying to implement the project I had already solved in my head into common lisp and was making little or no progress. So I fired up another vim terminal, solved the project in Python in about 30 minutes, including debugging, and then manually translated the code into lisp.<p>When project 2 rolled around, I decided to give it another go, but I quickly became frustrated again. Maybe my mind just isn't able to grok lisp? Maybe I'm just not smart enough?<p>All I'm claiming is that I am an example of a student who was already very knowledgeable about programming and completely unable to adapt to lisp.",1287453303

1805857,comment,1803351,1805369,0,0,varikin,,,"What makes it possible to launch 10% faster? Is it familiarity with the language, tools, libraries, and frameworks? Is it that the language is more dynamic and requires less to accomplish task X? I would say yes to both questions.<p>Now with the first question, familiarity with the language, lets discuss Python. Python is my language of choice. I know it, I use it, I pay attention to what is happening with the language, the community, etc. I organize a Python User Group. If I were to work on a new project, I would choose Python. I believe I could launch 10% if not 50% faster with Python than with Ruby. Does that make Python a better language? No. Just that I don't know Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, etc.<p>I think the second question about how dynamic the language is plays into this as well. Java is not very dynamic. Some tasks in Java are downright ugly to work with. If you want to prototype fast and spit out a product fast, you might not want to use Java. At that point, there are several great languages to choose from like Python, Ruby, Groovy, Scala, Lisp, Smalltalk, Javascript, Closure, etc. The list just goes on. You could also argue that .net is more dynamic. But Java has some good points to it as well. You have less risk of bugs due to it being statically and strictly typed. You can build off some great libraries. You get the benefit of the JVM and JIT, which are amazing. Maybe you can't launch faster with Java, but maybe you can launch with a more robust stable product. First doesn't mean best; remember the article about Wasabi and Mint?<p>The way I read Peter's comment was you don't want to spend you time finding the <i>best</i> language. Instead you want to just grab the most convenient language and spend your time creating the best product. Think through your architecture, work on your design, test the hell product, study the market, your competitors, work on your marketing, and on and on. The list of things to do never end, and if you were still debating about which language to choose, you won't launch.",1287452518

If you really look at where Microsoft has done well, it's not in consumer electronics devices like music players or phones, online services like search, consumer software like flight simulators or whatever and unlike Apple, Microsoft doesn't make computers (and probably shouldn't)...Microsoft does one thing and one thing really well, productivity software and providing centralized management of the enterprise. Both areas that they really don't have any serious competitors in. Apple doesn't care much about the enterprise, and iWorks is just a passable replacement for Office.<p>For my money, I still can't buy a comparable office productivity suite anywhere. iWorks is not bad, OO.org stinks, and everything else is distant also rans. Outlook on the Exchange ecosystem simply is awesome. And Windows these days ain't half bad.<p>Why are these pieces of software great? Because they can be abused beyond all recognition to do tasks so far off script that it can sometimes be jaw dropping, and still they function exactly fine...and the path to that madness isn't really all that long...and in a pinch, you can MacGuyver together an Office solution to many real world problems in a snap and the software will see you through the day. It's not great software, it's generally poorly designed, and full of feature creep, but it gets you through some serious pinches. Some of these user patterns are so common that they've become the defacto use for the software. Does anybody balance their checkbook in Excel anymore?<p>Microsoft needs to stop mucking about in areas that they'll never have a credible presence and focus the entire company on this core competency. We will always, always, always, need email, a word processor, a spreadsheet and a presentation tool.<p>Questions they should be asking themselves:<p>Why doesn't Exchange and Outlook expose enterprise IM better? This should be standard everywhere.<p>Why does collaboration with Office products still stink?<p>Why don't I have an instant file name search tool with optional content index built into the OS better than the crap they already provide? Something like everything <a href=""http://www.voidtools.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voidtools.com/</a> with a Lucene index for full text search. This stuff doesn't have to drag the entire OS down.<p>Why doesn't Microsoft have a centralized and updated on-line repository for driver management (redirect-able to a local Enterprise server)?<p>Why does every Windows computer not ship with an IDE and half a dozen languages? How come I don't have Perl & Python installed by default?<p>Why the hell is Visio so poorly integrated with the other Office tools? This seems like a no brainer to me. The amount of half-assed diagram and chart building people do in PowerPoint is absurd.<p>Why doesn't Microsoft control the end-user software distribution channel by now? Why do I have Steam installed when Microsoft built <i>everything</i> to support gaming on my PC except for that last bit? Seriously, what the hell?<p>Why does the built in defragger suck so bad? Why do I have to defrag at all?<p>Why do I have to get virus scanning software? Why does Microsoft make virus scanning software and hardly promote it? Why isn't that just part of some Windows update? Don't look for something to certify protection status, and then not be the provider of that software.<p>Why does IE consistently suck? If there's ever a productivity tool that needs to be the best in class like Word and Excel, it's IE.<p>Why does Office not have photo and video productivity software? It doesn't have to be great, Paint.net is pretty good for photo editing. Ditch Paint, and get with it. There's some upsell opportunity here, everybody needs a paint program. For that matter, make a variant of PowerPoint as a stupid simple Vector Graphics tool...everybody uses it for that anyway, just formalize it and turn it into a revenue opportunity.<p>How can we better integrate our Office products? Everybody routinely uses the other tools to build content for Word documents, and Word to edit text for the other tools. Cut all the overlapping crap out and just use those tools instead. I shouldn't have a table and a drawing editor in Word, but I should be able to paste something from Excel into Word without the formatting getting screwed all to hell and the table running past the edges of the document margins. Just open the appropriate tool for the job when needed.<p>And then I should be able to use the copy and other assets I make in Word to better feed Publisher (which is also something strangely absent from most Office installs, but does a passable job for simple Desktop Publishing).<p>Basically, make your content generating tools generate content for each other, do it really well, and then open the APIs so other people can play in this new productivity ecosystem.<p>You know what I routinely need? I need a best in class OCR tool to mass OCR lots of scanned documents. That would make me super productive. Why isn't that part of Office? Why am I stuck with an absolutely unusable and ancient format designed for digital faxes?<p>You know what I would have given a left foot for in High School and College and Grad School? A decent, highly integrated CAS (not Excel), at least on par (and preferably compatible with) with my TI-89, but at better resolution with more features and functionality, and that let me copy and paste equations and such from-to the tool.<p>Microsoft already owns this area, they should be looking for more ways to monetize on it. I just gave them 3 or 4 new products they could sell as part of a bonus back for Office and make some cash off of it. Instead, we get Bing, Zune, Windows Phone, Songsmith, Streets, WorldWide Telescope, Autocollage and other useless, aborted or otherwise DOA products.<p>Why the hell does Microsoft still have Works?

Then I started building larger apps, and I started to get the kind of attitude about it that leads very many programmers to declare that ""PHP sucks"" or ""I hate PHP.""  Then, I started building even larger apps, and I cursed PHP for every line of code I had to write.<p>Then, something happened.  Yes, the language matured, but I also started using application frameworks in PHP, which addressed many of the issues I had with PHP, and then I built an MVC framework from scratch, based on what I'd learned.<p>Now, I just don't care.  I'm not going to defend PHP as a <i>good</i> language, not even it's creator will do that, but when people go on about how terrible PHP is, my first thought is ""well, then use it more, and eventually you'll stop caring.""<p>I stick with PHP, specifically for open source, because of it's install density, because it is extremely flexible, and because I know all it's weird quirks and inconsistencies so well that they no longer bother me.  I wouldn't mind switching to a more structured and consistent language if it came up, but I don't see PHP as a limitation for anything I want to accomplish, and haven't for a very long time.<p>And anyways, terrible code is terrible code, and when I think about having to delve into projects that are spaghetti, or procedural, or have no separation of concerns, I don't blame the language for my frustration.",1287452120

Any language that has the ability to evaluate strings as code can do it.<p><pre><code>  # Ruby\n  a = ""some text""\n  b = ""a""\n  eval b # => ""some text""\n\n  # Python\n  a = ""some text""\n  b = ""a""\n  eval(b) # => ""some text""\n\n  # Javascript\n  a = ""some text"";\n  b = ""a"";\n  eval(b) // => ""some text""\n</code></pre>\nI've found the the more ""quick and dirty"" a language is, the simpler it is to use variable variables. And I don't mean quick and dirty as an insult. Bash supports this, and while I consider it quick and dirty, you can pry bash from my cold dead hands.<p><pre><code>  # Bash\n  a=""some text""\n  b=""a""\n  echo ${!b} # => ""some text""\n</code></pre>\nHaving said all that, using variable variables is a great way to piss off whoever has to maintain your code, so use them sparingly, and only when appropriate. There is little or no opportunity for context with variable variables. To add insult to injury, variable variables can result in gaping security holes as well. Think of the implications were an attacker able to substitute the value of the variable variable in any situation where the output is sent to the client. The attacker could randomly guess at variable names, dumping all manner of information. Anything in the global scope. Yikes!<p>There are far better ways to do this in modern languages. For example, use a hash or dictionary construct. A Ruby example:<p><pre><code>  # Ruby\n  myhash = { :a => ""some text"" }\n  b = ""a""\n  myhash[b.to_sym] # => ""some text""\n</code></pre>\nA Python example using a dict:<p><pre><code>  # Python\n  mydict = { 'a' : ""some text"" }\n  b = ""a""\n  mydict[b] # => ""some text""\n</code></pre>\nA hash or dictionary gives you the opportunity to give your collection a meaningful name, scopes the evaluation to that object (so you can't arbitrarily retrieve variable data), and provides context.",1287451663

Yes, XBox 360 sales faired much better over the summer, but we will have to wait and see if this indicates a sustainable trend or a blip.<p>- Yes, Xbox 360 is doing well from the standpoint of attach rates, with an 8.9 versus around a 7ish for the Wii. It appears the PS3 has been gaining significant ground lately with its attach rate.<p>- In the fiscal year 2010, Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices Division (which includes the Xbox 360) generated $8.5 billion in revenues and just $679 million in operating income. Considering Microsoft's consolidated operating income in 2010 was $24 billion, this $679 million represents only about 3% of Microsoft's profits.<p>- Ultimately, the Xbox 360, the PS3, and the Wii may be irrelevant given the emergence of connected televisions, thin devices, and cloud-based gaming.",1287451541

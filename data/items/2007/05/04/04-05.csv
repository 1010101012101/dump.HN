The thought didn't even cross my mind that someone visiting this site would really care about that :)<p>What I'm saying though, is that someone Googles your name - acquaintance, potential customer/partner/reviewer/employ<i>ee</i> etc, and it'll happen more and more as you get more successful, they'll make a snap judgement based on what they see (and your blog will be #1). <p>You're writing interesting content but kind of shooting yourself in the foot by adding a few (very light) personal/group attacks in there. I'm just saying a bit more effort/restraint could turn it into a real asset, people will visit the site and say, wow, this is a guy to look out for. Larry O'Brien (<a href=""http://www.knowing.net)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.knowing.net)</a> is one example - I wouldn't know him from a bar of soap without his blog, but I found it, liked it, still read it, and I can tell you now that he'll be far richer in opportunities because he's put that effort in.<p>So that's what I meant. Maybe I'm overstepping the mark by saying it instead of thinking it, and I should have worded it better, but really I'm just trying to give you a bit of constructive criticism (and like I said, if you're just using it as a diary or to vent, please do ignore what I'm saying).",1178254657

Just like choosing a developer. One thing you can do to reduce your risk is to hire someone for a small task first (say, do the logo), and if you like their work, ask them to do the whole project.

Interesting interpretation of data there :)<p>I have to give you props for actually taking the effort to write a blog, but I really think you should work on polishing things a bit more if you're trying to turn it into an asset (if you're just venting steam then please ignore). People will read this kind of stuff when they Google your name, after all:<p>-- I love Apple fanboys. They never stop drinking Apple's Kool-Aid. <p>-- Maybe, if that 499 is in pesos. If that's USD dollars and you think it's underpriced then yes, you are the moron.<p>-- It'll sell a couple million units to the many people who have wet dreams about Steve Jobs, and that will be about it.\n",1178252029

Is it to take a detailed concept YOU give him and convert it into a design(cheap)? Is it to THINK through your technical product, think how users will use it, then design(more work)?<p>What if the design fails to impress potential users?<p>I don't know any designer who will guarantee that your users will like the design so this one is tough. <p>-Zaid<p>",1178251662

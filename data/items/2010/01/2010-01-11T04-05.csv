1044366,comment,1043753,1043753,0,0,whyme,,,"Six years back or so natural gas was worth a lot - then all of the sudden there were huge discoveries offshore while at the same time technology improved such that onshore shale formations previously not economical became cheap and prolific. Now natural gas is cheap, cheap, cheap and no one goes around saying we're running out.<p>Oil is no different. Oil isn't endless, and we are nowhere near reaching peak oil (maybe we have in conventional oil, but even that's debatable). It's really just a matter of how economic it is to produce even the known resources and how well they are managed. Many countries (the bigger oil producing ones) tend to damage access to the resources by producing too fast (due to the discount factor to time/money). There's opportunity to get that back in the future with new technology and time.<p>To give an example comparing the natural gas situation to oil, Canada is making huge strides in reducing the cost of producing heavy oil, it used to be $50+ per barrel and is now down to $19-33 per barrel. With oil prices at $80 per barrel you can see the profit margin is large enough to make money.<p>Most oil companies take the majority of profit from oil and re-invest into buying more properties, investing most of it into discovering new resources. They wouldn't be doing that if they thought there was none left to find. Check out the top producers of oil and look at their investments vs. their profits and you'll see.<p>As a side note... I don't see why much of the oil demand can not be off loaded to natural gas should the gov't + manufacturing companies choose to invest that way. Vehicles can run, houses can be heated, and plants can all operate on natural gas.... Natural gas has proven to be more environmentally cleaner than coal, they even produce less environmental damages than the facilities used to produce electric and corn oil alternatives. So I really don't get all the hype. It's all just market fixing/speculation for the most part and lack of quality information.",1263185845

Informally, you can ask them for advice about hard projects.  Maintaining the tools, they do a fine job.  Liability to the city, I don't recall whether I had to sign a disclaimer or not when I first went there.   I don't think so but I could be mis-remembering.

Actually, we do!  You should see our neighborhood-based disaster-prep system.  It has miles to go before I feel like I can laugh at the next big earthquake but it is quite impressive.

The pressure from the pile began to cause a leak in the wall.  The leak was small at first.  A cable television employee spotted the leak and even captured it on video tape.  The cable televison company then brought the problem to the attention of the city.  Unfortunately, the city allowed the leak to continue for several months without repair. Eventually, the drift wall gave way, and the river poured into the tunnels. The water completely flooded the system, including many basements that were still connected to it. The Loop was shut down for days, and the flood caused millions of dollars in damage. The torrent of flood water, silt, and debris probably destroyed most of the remaining Chicago Tunnel Company freight cars and artifacts. If the city acted quickly and if the water tight doors had been left in place and maintained, the flood may have been prevented.",1263185297

Could this be a bunch of bullshit? sure. However, after 30 days of completely eliminating wheat, dairy, complex sugars, and starches, I was blown away by how good I felt. I'm still surprised at how I feel, and at my energy levels and general weight loss. So, as I said, I started a site (because that's what geeks do) and now this is how I eat. There's lots of people who follow Paleo eating for a variety of reasons. Some are purely performance driven, and have found Paleo to be a great diet plan to help their athletic performance. Some people are celiacs and have wheat allergies and/or lactose intollerant, so eating Paleo is a natural decision. I've also met people who are just interested in eating whole foods, versus processed foods, and have found this diet makes them feel better.<p>I have to leave it to people like Scott Hagnas, Robb Wolf, and Loren Cordain for the science of it, but for me, I feel great, look great, and am just in a better mood all the time after giving up a few things.

I just upgraded from my good old Sony Ericsson w800i (had it for ~3 years) to an iPhone 3GS. I thought long and hard about this move, I've seriously pondering upgrading my phone for about 3 - 4 months now. I finally went with an iPhone mainly for two reasons:<p>1. I bought myself a Mac desktop last year and I love it. I felt the iPhone would compliment nicely.<p>2. They've had a couple of iterations to sort out the kinks in the iPhone now and IMHO it shows.<p>The 3GS feels very polished to me and I don't regret my decision. I've only had my iPhone for about 10 days and I already have Google Sync set up for email/calendar syncing, I've used it as a Skype VoIP handset (in conjunction with my home Wi-Fi), I've got games on my phone that are actually worth playing, mobile Internet access that's actually practical to use and I've got an awesome remote for use with the VLC media player.<p>I've even made a few phone calls.<p>I really thought about getting one of the slightly less mainstream phones that might give me more ""geek cred"" or something. But in the end, I just want as good a user experience as possible and I felt I would get that from the iPhone. YMMV.<p>Granted, upgrading from a SE w800i I probably would be more than happy with any of the current generation of phones and I can't directly comment on the N1. But all my research led me to the conclusion that if you're looking for polished, go with the iPhone. If you're wanting a little more bleeding edge and experimental, go for one of the other options.",1263183382

It contains a huge assortment of what the human body needs as a single food source.  Combined with a little meat and a little fruit and a human go go from a child to live a long and healthy life eating nothing else.  However, you can also make a healthy diet by completely avoiding it.  A large part of a healthy diet is variety and while that can be a pain in our modern society blaming any single highly refined food as horrible while ignoring the other components of your diet is missing a large part of the story.<p>The less verity in a persons diet the closer to perfection what they do eat needs to be.  When you consider the quantity of fructose in the average American diet of course there is a problem, but mainly because of what it replaces and not what it is.  If you burned 4k calories a day and drink 1k worth of sucrose water you can still have a healthy if unusual diet.  However, when you are only consuming 2k worth of calories a day 50% of which provides zero nutrition your body is probably missing out on important things.",1263183074

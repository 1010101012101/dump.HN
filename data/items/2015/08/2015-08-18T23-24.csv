Post your impressions",,"I&#x27;m Emir Lima, programmer of TRAF, a new fighting game current in development in Brazil.<p>We&#x27;re developing this game with an innovative concept of having only one single button for all attacks. It dispenses complex inputs and all the variations of the attacks are achieved pressing the button while holding a direction on D-Pad. The special moves are also simple to execute, pressing Down, Down + Attack or Forward, Back, Forward + Attack.<p>Another great feature is that an attack can be cancelled with any other attack so it&#x27;s easy to perform combos. The only concern of the player is having sufficient power bar and hit at the right time.<p>Due to be in development, some content are still being finished, like background, HUD and effects.<p>Here&#x27;s a video showing the main features present at the moment and a brief battle of the two characters available (turn on subtitles in youtube):<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c3rQnBhAQ4<p>Check it out our facebook and tumblr to follow our progress.

It&#x27;s sought after because it has nice employee perks, but it&#x27;s fallen a long ways from the early days in terms of prestige. They now have thousands of engineers working on mundane jobs moving around advertising data.<p>I&#x27;ve interviewed a couple of ex-googler&#x27;s (not fired, still employed there) at a startup and we had to turn them down. They could handle a simple coding exercise fine, but then fell over in the component where they had to debug code and extend it with a feature.<p>That was when I realized a big chunk of Google&#x27;s employees are going to be a reflection of their interview process (puzzle solvers but not software engineers). This was even reflected in the creation of the Go language. It&#x27;s stupid simple to deal with Google employees that don&#x27;t know how to use more advanced features in a language without creating something unmaintainable.<p>You can get 20 years 6 figure salary in most of the locations Google operates offices working for other companies.

They make a vague note about not collecting the <i>content</i> of network traffic (but you can infer almost everything important from source, destination, time, protocol, etc anyway) and  the table on the page is just described as &quot;examples&quot; of what it collects, and is never stated to be the full list. Given that Google is in the data collection business, and has a licence to update the device (and what it collects) automatically, I would assume that within a short timespan it will be collecting everything it can get away with.<p>Even what they do mention is enough to start inferring things about your personal life:<p>With &quot;historical data consumption&quot; they can determine who is in the house and when. With the number and make of connected devices, they can take a pretty good estimate of family size, annual income, how many of your household are working, etc.. (Though they probably first care how many Apple devices there are connecting... maybe we need to send you some more Samsung adverts)<p>And sure it strips the URLs from the logs -- but between Google DNS and Google Analytics being on much of the web, they can piece back together every site you visit anyway and now your router has a Google account they can tie it right back to the router in your home.<p>And of course it&#x27;s a $199 router with a license agreement that says Google can stop it working at any time they like (clause 5c).",1439942318

10082912,comment,10080956,10082537,0,0,andrepd,,,"You are doing it wrong. You are not supposed to &quot;learn&quot; C++, not entirely. C is simple in the sense that the amount of things that there are to know about the language are small (it&#x27;s about as low level as you can get) and it is possible and required to learn its computation and memory model and all its features to work with it.<p>In the case of C++, it&#x27;s neither required, nor even possible to learn ALL of C++ (not without a couple decades of experience). C++ is a monster, a colossus, a many tentacled monstrosity of hundreds if not thousands of sometimes very complicated features. You cannot possibly master it all.<p>Yet the barrier to entry is as high as C, if nothing at least because C is a subset of C++. You don&#x27;t have to be a template metaprogramming wizard and make full benefit of the latest standards&#x27; new features in order to <i>know</i> C++. As an example, in my work in physics I use C++ consisting of C, templates, the STL and POD structs. I don&#x27;t use C++&#x27;s immense OOP tools simply because I don&#x27;t like/don&#x27;t need them. Someone else might use the full OOP features of the language. Still someone else might reduce it to C with templating because they like C but hate not having generic programming.<p>In short: C++ is what you make of it. Your C++ is a subset of <i>the</i> C++. It&#x27;s your job to decide what features you want to learn and make use of. Don&#x27;t feel like you don&#x27;t understand C++ because you don&#x27;t know Stroustroup cover-to-cover by heart.",1439941387

There&#x27;s nothing stopping someone else from going out to find germplasm with a similar trait and generating their own construct.  With advances in technology, this becomes ever easier to do.

The framing makes a very sweeping assumption about both All Men and All Women.<p>I struggle with how to express this, but it implicitly disregards female agency and the complexity of female psychology or sexuality.<p>I was sexually abused as a child. I have certainly had fantasies that I found disturbing at the time. In my teens, I would fantasize about the Russians invading and taking over my high school. In my fantasies, I would end up with some Russian officer based on the virtue of knowing 2 dozen words of Russian.<p>In my twenties, I did a lot of therapy. I ultimately concluded this was a rescue fantasy. It expressed how grim-dark my life felt in my teens and how trapped I felt at the time. It expressed my fear that there were no nice men and there was nothing but evil in the world. But it placed me in protective custody of a powerful figure as the least worst answer I could imagine.<p>In reality, I got married at age 19 to another 19 year old. He was something of a knife covered nutcase and he ultimately joined the army, which effectively extracted me from my hometown and whisked me away from my abusers. A &quot;nice&quot; young man would not have been able to help me. A previous attempt at a relationship to a nicer man resulted in him being chewed up and spit out by the situation.<p>So I have a history of both a fantasy life and real life experience of being attracted to men who aren&#x27;t &quot;nice.&quot; In neither case was it really what it appeared to be on the surface. No white knight could possibly have saved me. So I sought out an honorable dark knight.<p>Any degree of intrigue I have with something like a chastity belt would be rooted not in vilifying men as cruel and controlling but in trying to imagine some means of finally feeling washed clean of the stigma of the abuse I endured. I am 50 years old. It happened long ago and far away. There are people who still judge me as a bad girl or dirty girl because of the crimes and failings of other people. Some things are incredibly hard to wash off.<p>If you look at female fantasies as an outsider, as a man who sees his own frustrations with women, perhaps they look pretty condemning of men. But if you treat women as human beings, you have to wonder what&#x27;s in it for them. You have to ask what they are getting out of it. And that results in a very different conclusion about why a specific unpleasant image might interest them.",1439938809

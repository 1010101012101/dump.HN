7033186,comment,7030203,7032897,0,0,sophacles,,,"Probably. Would you refuse to hire a chinese programmer who speaks fluent russian (or even just really good russian)? (if you say &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing&quot; that is racist fyi). The cultural differences mean communication difficulties is a bit of a strawman. There are lots of cultural differences your statement ignores: country folk vs city folk within russia probably have differences (they do most places), those born pre and post communism probably have cultural differences, etc.<p>(Warning - attempts at trying to draw me down a semantic rabbit hole about what culture is are very much distracting from this conversation and will be ignored, and probably should be ignored by others as they are pretty blatantly strawmen).<p>Pretending differences don&#x27;t appear amongst different groups of people is ignorant. However using this to justify all groupings is also ignorant. For one thing there are different types of groupings, some valid, some not. Some reflect inherently true things, some statistically probable things, and some that are not inherently true but the result of various other factors combined with an arbitrary and otherwise insignificant grouping. For another, a lot of groupings don&#x27;t lend themselves to generalizations - for instance in the US in California especially, being ethnically Chinese doesn&#x27;t imply being an immigrant, or having recently immigrated family, so assuming that a person who is ethnically Chinese speaks Mandarin is a bad assumption based on a bad generalization from a grouping that probably doesn&#x27;t even matter.",1389301163

7033170,comment,7032453,7032453,10,0,chestnut-tree,,,"From the article: <i>&quot;The average Internet user seems unconcerned about participatory surveillance. He is prepared to give up his privacy to get valuable service for free. As a result there is little or no organized resistance to automated mass surveillance.&quot;</i><p>This is true and quite depressing, but I also think it&#x27;s because people aren&#x27;t fully aware of just how much tracking takes place and how often. It&#x27;s clearly not in the interests of Google, Facebook and others to reveal what they track and record (hence why their privacy policies are so vaguely worded).<p>Would people care more about privacy if they were better informed? Maybe (or maybe not).<p>Consider the following scenario. You buy a Chromebook and use it exclusively for a year as your main computer. You have to be signed in to use ChromeOS, so Google potentially tracks everything you do online. We don&#x27;t know exactly what Google captures because they don&#x27;t actually say. But let&#x27;s assume that after one year of Chromebook use, Google have records of the following:<p>- Every single website you visited (and the duration and time of day).<p>- A detailed picture of your online shopping habits, including what you shopped for and maybe even purchased online.<p>- Every document you printed included number of pages, time of day you printed, number of copies, the printer you sent the print job to. Whether it was colour or B&W.<p>- Every Google app you use, when you use it and how often etc.<p>- Details about the order in which you do things on your computer. Always check your email as the first thing when you switch on? Google will undoubtedly know this from analysing your activity.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget that Google will stitch together what you though were disparate journeys. Browsing a shopping site for a particular product? Later you go to YouTube to search for a review of the product. Google joins up the connection. (A reminder that this is all speculation on my part but I think it&#x27;s fairly realistic speculation.)<p>Now imagine if all this data was presented to you at the end of the year. You might think it&#x27;s incredibly cool to see so much about yourself - if it was only yourself who saw this data. How would you feel if you knew it was Google that was seeing and keeping this data? You might think it perfectly benign and necessary for the personalisation features you enjoy. Or maybe you might decide that Chromebooks are the biggest privacy hole imaginable and vow to stop using them.",1389300975

7033163,comment,7030628,7032884,7,0,bad_user,,,"Code reuse or the lack thereof also affects the users, because there is more potential for bugs. Reinventing the wheel may be warranted, the end result may actually be more stable depending on who works on that wheel reinvention, but lets not kid ourselves - every line of code written increases the potential for bugs and there&#x27;s nothing that affects the user experience more than a broken app.<p>Besides, bytes count is important, but it&#x27;s only a problem because people aren&#x27;t using tree-shaking optimizers, like Google Closure. E.g. when importing a library like JQuery, you&#x27;re paying for a lot of crap in it that you don&#x27;t need. A smart tree-shaker is able to detect unused branches and eliminate everything you don&#x27;t use.<p>And it&#x27;s a solvable problem. Google Closure in &quot;advanced&quot; optimizations mode is amazing. Unfortunately the popular libraries are not written for Closure&#x27;s advanced optimizations and thus are incompatible. This is where compilers can help us. ClojureScript for example compiles to Google Closure optimized Javascript. There&#x27;s also a fork of an older version of TypeScript that does the same thing. Google&#x27;s Dart does tree shaking too. Maybe we&#x27;ll also see EcmaScript 6 compilers that will do it too.<p>We don&#x27;t need to sacrifice code reuse because of bytes count. I mean, sure, if you don&#x27;t find a library that matches your architectural needs, wheel reinvention is fine. But optimizing for bytes count is a stupid reason to do it and we only feel the need for it because our tool-chains are primitive.",1389300942

Or, failing that, why not handle things like that with a collection of favorite libraries, each of which has its own calling conventions, its own requirements, and its own attitude toward the world? Reconciling all those differences certainly won&#x27;t take a significant amount of time, and I&#x27;m always happy to spend my efforts on tooling instead of on whatever project inspired the need for tooling in the first place.<p>More seriously, I can understand where you might be coming from with the implication that frameworks are a crutch for developers who don&#x27;t bother to learn, or aren&#x27;t capable of learning, the language in which the framework is implemented; I&#x27;ve had to clean up the wreckage left behind by Ruby on Rails hacks, too.<p>But what&#x27;s important to keep in mind is that the Rails dev community is extremely atypical in its extremely low average level of basic programming capability, and the Rails framework is likewise anomalous in the degree to which it forgives such incompetence. These traits, I stress, are not common to frameworks in general or to the developers who employ them, and consequently it is very much a mistake to use the Rails ghetto as a basis for extrapolation to more or less anything else. It&#x27;s your mistake to make, of course, and if you insist upon it, then I won&#x27;t go to any further effort on your behalf. But you can&#x27;t say no one tried to warn you.",1389300908

It has the same purpose such as anti-theft laws. business markets depend on property law, and could not operate without it. However, selecting enforcement of property law can be exploited in the market, and a segregation between those who exploit and those who don&#x27;t then happens.<p>3: anti-theft laws and &quot;software freedom&quot; are not directly related. This is where the confusion comes from.<p>> It would be more accurate to say, for what it defines as &quot;User Products&quot;, that the GPLv3 actively encourages device renters to circumvent the property rights of devices&#x27; owners, and bars device owners from having the technical tools to prevent that.<p>You seem to imply that manufacturer are the device owner after they have sold the device. Here we must come to a disagreement, as I follow the classic view that a trade results in a change in ownership. The financial transaction causes the manufacturer to assign ownership of a specific device over to the buyer in exchange for money. The new owner of the device is thus no longer the manufacturer, but the person who paid money for it.<p>Maybe the wikipedia article, or a dictonary would help you here. Renting is not the same as a trade. I can see how you might get those two words confused, but really, they are not the same thing.<p>If device manufacturers want lease out devices rather then trade them, they can likely do so without having comply with the requirements in the GPLv3 license.

It&#x27;s true that Nintendo tries to make games cheaper than many AAA game companies, though with the ballooning cost of AAA game development that&#x27;s not saying much. It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s often in new genres. And it&#x27;s <i>very</i> true that they focused on a different, broader market than Microsoft and Sony back in the Wii&#x27;s heyday. What I&#x27;m saying is that innovation alone is not enough to create success. It must be pointed in the right direction. At times they&#x27;ve gotten this right, at other times they haven&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s nonsense to imply that Nintendo games aren&#x27;t polished, or that third-party AAA game developers will necessarily dominate any genre that they choose to develop for. I can&#x27;t think of a 2D platformer that has ever done as well as Mario, and 2D platformers are one of gaming&#x27;s oldest genres -- certainly a &quot;mature genre&quot;.<p>That article was written back in 2005, just after the Wii Remote was announced, when people were still speculating about that strange new controller and what it could mean. We have the benefit of hindsight now, and the best way to understand what was going on then is to take it straight from the horse&#x27;s mouth, looking back at the early days of the Wii, when Nintendo talked openly about their business strategy. Back then, they outright said that they based their new strategy on the books <i>The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma</i> and <i>The Blue Ocean Strategy</i>. (They talked about this in their shareholder meetings, which were available online but which I unfortunately can no longer find.) These books give us a framework for understanding what they were doing then -- no need to create ungainly terms like &quot;genre king&quot;. The books talk about conceiving of the market as the &quot;core&quot; -- which were the people who were actively playing and buying games at the time, and which were the target market of their competitors -- and the &quot;expanded audience&quot; -- which were those who weren&#x27;t playing games, or who used to play but had since stopped. The latter is who Nintendo chose to focus on back then. Innovation did play a part in that, but it doesn&#x27;t explain it entirely: some games were innovative and succeeded, (ex. Wii Sports), some were innovative and failed, (ex. Wii Music, remember that one?) and some were <i>not</i> innovative but still managed to differentiate themselves by appealing to the expanded audience (ex. New Super Mario Bros.). To lump the latter category of games, which were new entries in genres with long and storied histories, together with games that were in completely new genres, is contradictory.<p>New Super Mario Bros., for one, effectively used none of the hardware features of the Wii to its advantage, and was still one of the strongest-selling games of the generation. Its success is attributable not to innovation but to being a game that many people, especially the expanded audience, wanted to play. It&#x27;s as simple as that.",1389300185

Some of the children were quizzed again by a researcher when aged 5, others at age 6 or 7, 8 or 9. This way the researchers were able to chart differences in amounts of forgetting through childhood.</i> //<p>They did, but why?<p>In order to isolate the mothers influence and make the study capable of providing scientific results one would need to rule out the major external factors - the primary one in my view is paternal interactions.<p>If they chose only mothers to assess - and the presence of only mothers in the other studies suggests they did - then this seems notable. Why? Did they already have a result showing paternal interactions had no effect? Are they trying to demonstrate a theory in which only maternal interactions are valid for stimulating recall? Or what? Just seems like a big old hole that would warrant a mention somewhere in such an article.",1389299536

The lack of extensive code examples slowed everything down. Doing the easy stuff was amazingly fast. Want to do something creative or complicated? NO!! That custom framework held back the talented programmers in so many ways.</i><p>Well, at the time it was alta-vista not google we turned to. :)<p>The code was pretty straight-forward Java (about the most clever thing was use of forName and assorted reflection), so finding stuff was not a problem.  We had many examples; examples as part of the rather good documentation was important for us.<p>We tried to avoid doing anything complicated.  That was part of the point.  Negative lines of code was a win.<p>It was easier to work with and figure out and extend than the alternatives at the time, and arguably still cleaner and more light-weight then what came after.<p>When the time came to move to some standard Java thing is was no easier (and often harder) to find decent examples or docs.<p><i>And because every problem was novel and usually caused by some restriction in the framework you learnt solutions and patterns that you never, ever used again.</i><p>No, not at all.<p>I really don&#x27;t get this broad dismissal of all in-house frameworks.  Is it so far-fetched to think that a small group of smart developers with business domain knowledge can build fast, lean, code?  Maybe I was just lucky to have experienced this, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so rare.<p>The code was good, clean, Java.  We ran into some issues because of garbage collection (we were really pushing things for speed and memory) for some related code but roadblocks due to our basic tools were rare.<p>Somehow we avoided over-engineering stuff.  It actually worked, and worked well.<p><i>And when they left your company, those talented developers suddenly found themselves 3-5 years behind people who would previously have been their equal. They had effectively learnt a completely useless programming language.</i><p>Again, no, not at all. They had little trouble picking up EJBs or whatever was the Java-du-jour, if they needed, but unlike devs who only knew how to piece together beans and JSPs (basically plug-and-play coders) they knew how to handle things when stuff didn&#x27;t work as expected or as the docs insisted. They could actually program because they actually knew the language.<p>Contrast this to people who learn, say, only Rails, and Rails conventions, and write very little custom Ruby code.  They&#x27;re at the mercy of the framework because they&#x27;re married to a particular tool rather then being immersed in the underlying language.  Ideally if one picks a framework one should also really learn the underlying language, but given a choice in hiring I&#x27;ll go with the one who knows the language over one who knows a framework.<p>Perhaps not every case of using your own custom tools, well-designed for the task at hand, is the same, or does not work out well for every type of programmer.<p>I have worked places where they used poorly-conceived in-house tools, and it was not good.  But that&#x27;s not the case everyplace, and a business can get a competitive advantage using tools streamlined for their domain.",1389298226

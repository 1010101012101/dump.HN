Once you insert some sort of trust or authorization model, this problem gets mitigated pretty quickly.  The most obvious counterexample to your point is the rich ecosystem of API-based mashups.  Mashups exist as integration points for multiple content sources where content authors provide their own metadata.<p>While there's a lot of talk these days about the idea of ""semantic search engines,"" most practical uses of the semantic web are actually just souped up mashups -- solutions to integration problems combined with some lightweight AI.",1222911032

I'm pretty sure that you only get that dividend if the company turns a profit, but thats pretty fucking good.  Not only that, but after 3 years they can buy it back for a 10% premium.

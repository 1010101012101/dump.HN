 I simply say that it&#x27;s a combination of identity loss and racism. The War on Drugs, particularly weed, was pretty much started purely because of greed & racism. <a href=""http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/why-is-marijuana-illegal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/why-is-marijuana-illegal...</a> When alcohol was attempted to be made illegal, too many white people got mad so that law had to be removed. Since weed mostly effects non-whites, it&#x27;s illegal to this day. Put them in jail, ruin the background-check, we already know a resume with a black name doesn&#x27;t get called back as often as a different name - all good for continued welfare. Nobody is saying there&#x27;d be zero problems without racism, but it wouldn&#x27;t be so disproportionately bad.
 Africa itself also has a troubled history of slavery & other countries colonizing it. Also, the greed and corruption that comes from having diamonds & oil is still a problem today. It is also known that US dollars are funding those military.
 Also note that there are some parts of Africa that are not bad to live in, you just never see that on American TV. Of course it takes two for that to work, one to give the money and the other to accept it - but greed has millions of dollars & guns and everyone else doesn&#x27;t, so...
 I will end here saying that if I had my magicwand-timemachine, went back in time and removed slavery and somehow the corruption related to the country&#x27;s vast natural resources, things wouldn&#x27;t be like this. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resources_of_Africa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resources_of_Africa</a><p>And a quick side-note, there was a radio-host. A white woman I believe. They talked about gun-law reform. That&#x27;s another thing that gets minorities in trouble. She made the comment that if someone started a campaign to get all black males in Oakland signed up with the NRA and obtain a gun legally, gun-laws would be changed immediately. Why don&#x27;t minorities sign up with NRA to begin with? I don&#x27;t know, but whatever the reason is, that&#x27;s why gun-law hasn&#x27;t changed.  I believe that to be very true and I think laws in America are generally set in a way that lowers the likelihood that a non-minority will break them. It probably wasn&#x27;t that way on purpose at first, but once some people noticed the money from prisons and correction-facilities - combined with American&#x27;s fear of immigrants... the success of war on drugs in terms of who&#x27;s getting ruined by it...
 again not saying there would be zero problems, but the disproportionate levels e see today wouldn&#x27;t be happening. Don&#x27;t forget the reason  why a lot of black people are even in America to begin with...",1377601960

6282714,comment,6282473,6282590,2,0,fudyy,,,"Not sure this is fair. The government isn&#x27;t crazy like Deputy Minister Helpmann in Brazil. It really is trying to do its job. Imagine if every American football coach had to announce his play to the other team. What purpose would there be in it? So, there needs to be a system in place that helps keep secrets. But, the question is how should those that expose secrets be dealt with? No one wants to deal with those exposing state secrets because they are doing it to no one in particular, and aren&#x27;t being seen as actively trying to help terrorists. That is the problem and that is the reason we are comparing things to the movie Brazil here.<p>Growing up in the U.S., we were all taught the history of our country, which included Benedict Arnold. But very few see a parallel to Benedict Arnold in Snowden. They cannot see how someone whose main claim to fame in the press has been, &quot;They are watching you!&quot; has exposed state secrets. Neither do they think Julian Assange is Benedict Arnold. Julian is just posed as a well-meaning but much misled Australian hacker that probably got framed in a rape case and is on the run, like a modern day Frank Abagnale, but with state secrets instead of fake checks.<p>The fact is, our governments need respect in order to keep secrets better, but prosecuting and hunting down these people is not the answer, neither are other &quot;control&quot; techniques. They just need better security. If they had better security, I for one would respect the fact that they said, &quot;Oops! I guess I left the playbook in front of the press tent. I guess I should keep it on my person at all times.&quot;",1377601951

6282704,comment,6282318,6282318,1,0,Casseres,,,"First, like the others mentioned, I would work on getting friends.  If you want an idea on where to start with that (assuming you don&#x27;t want to be friends with anyone from work): From what I understand, Meetup.com is a great way to do this.  Develop a hobby that has minimal costs, and then find a group that meets for the purpose of that hobby.<p>---<p>To answer your question: Considering you want to achieve financial independence quickly, it&#x27;s good that you don&#x27;t own much stuff, otherwise your stuff would own you.<p>I recently discovered the blog Early Retirement Extreme.  There is a post [0] which gives the simple equation which must be true if you want to become financially independent: &quot;your annual expenses < 3% of your invested savings&quot;<p>Assuming you keep the same living costs before and after becoming financially independent, you will need to solve this equation:<p>living costs = SWR * ( income - living costs ) * ( ( (1 + ROR) ^ number of working years ) - 1 ) / ROR<p>where SWR = Safe Withdraw Rate and ROR = Rate Of Return.  SWR of 3% is taken from [0].<p>Assuming you can get 10% on your investments and can live on 25k a year, let&#x27;s enter some numbers and solve for working years:<p>25k = 0.03 * (56k - 25k) * ( ( (1 + 0.10) ^ X ) - 1 ) / 0.10<p>X = 13.7 years<p>Assuming 10% again, and working for 15 years, let&#x27;s see how much you could have to live on:<p>X = 0.03 * (56k - 25k) * ( ( (1 + 0.10) ^ 15 ) - 1 ) / 0.10<p>X = 29.5k<p>So if you worked for an extra 1.3 years, you could bump up your living expenses from 25k to 29.5k, a jump of $4500 a year.<p>EDIT: I forgot to include the 10k you have already saved up.  I would probably leave that out of the investments and keep in an emergency fund (keep it in your savings, and future savings would go straight to your investment account).<p>---<p>[0] <a href=""http://earlyretirementextreme.com/can-i-retire-young.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earlyretirementextreme.com/can-i-retire-young.html</a>",1377601646

9884909,comment,9882587,9882587,0,0,akavel,,,"Hmmm, personally, I have rather mixed feelings about this. I&#x27;d really like to be excited, but so far, I&#x27;m not. (And, on a somewhat tangential note, also I&#x27;m fairly surprised not to see any voices similar to mine here in the comments; am I the only one? hard to believe; or maybe others like me just shrug and don&#x27;t bother to write? sounds more probable, to me at least.)<p>I tried to analyze my thoughts on that; I&#x27;ll try to give some feedback/impressions, but please forgive if chaotic or otherwise flawed. So, in somewhat random order:<p>- I&#x27;m absolutely not interested in topic of &quot;stock trading&quot;, or similar stuff. I&#x27;m not into trading/speculation, whether stock, currencies, or else. I don&#x27;t like gaming others. Or PvP. So, if that&#x27;s gonna be required, or important, sounds very much like something unfun to me. I like building stuff, and especially useful stuff. In my mind I characterize myself as &quot;an engineer&quot;. And from this description, I don&#x27;t see much in this area for myself. Even if I&#x27;m going to be building something here (some in-game &quot;cyberdeck&quot; of tools), I don&#x27;t know how this could be practically useful for someone else, outside the game; so for now it sounds like wasted time and effort to me.<p>- From the original announcement, it sounded to me as an attempt at something revolutionary, appealing to a wide audience, and who don&#x27;t have much free time they can put into this (but I may have overinterpreted, I dunno). Given my previous objection, I don&#x27;t see how it is so, for now. Specifically, when/if I have free time, I prefer to put it into attempts at some open-source work, so that it would be useful to others, while also I could learn something. But when I don&#x27;t have much time, I don&#x27;t see how I could take part in the game in any meaningful way, such that my &quot;score&quot; could reflect my knowledge & abilities. In other words, for now it sounds like it requires some &quot;grinding&quot;, and for me that sounds like wasted time (real world requires enough grinding). I don&#x27;t really see how this differs from MicroCorruption (where I also didn&#x27;t care to waste time on that), or other &quot;CTF&quot;s. Or, really, &quot;an actual job&quot;. Only unpaid^H^H^H^H^H^H&quot;paid&quot; in virtual karma points/pixie dust (&quot;score&quot;).<p>- The one thing that seems mildly interesting to me as of now, is the AVR theme. I&#x27;m somewhat hoping to dabble a bit in microcontroller programming (one of my many hobby project ideas). So, if I correctly understood that it&#x27;s aimed to have a very faithful simulator of an AVR, I may at least learn something in this area, which may be easier than experimenting on real hardware. So, maybe the relatively &quot;wide range of topics&quot; (stock trading, AVRs, compilers, competition) might be the &quot;revolutionary&quot; aspect, so that there&#x27;s higher chance everyone will find something for oneself? But if I&#x27;m willing to grind only on one aspect in-game, then my &quot;total score&quot; will probably be low, no? Unless at least the scores are multi-aspect, not totalled/averaged. Still, if I don&#x27;t grind on other aspects, they won&#x27;t show up in my profile, and will remain unknown to &quot;potential employers&quot;, no? Also, back to the AVR theme, microcontrollers are closely related to electronics (i.e. very physical hardware: cables, soldering, analog voltages, timing, unexpected capacitances, coupling, etc.), and here I presume I won&#x27;t be able to learn anything anyway.<p>All that said, I understand that this is kinda &quot;2nd trailer announcement&quot;, and the stuff is not open to public yet, so the jury is still out.",1436882359

9884865,comment,9883928,9884660,0,0,justaaron,,,"because this is a red herring, likely not true, and besides the point: the point is that the 5 years of austerity, privatizations, and privations have ruined the Greek economy, made it impossible to achieve the surplus goals mandated, and basically ensured that there will be no way to exit the debt. further application of the same medicine is stupid, unless you are TRYING to destroy and divide-up Greece, hence the metaphors discussed.
A constructive economic policy needs to replace austerity as the Eurogroup medicine for economies like Greece, as we can see that it doesn&#x27;t work.
There is also the issue that you seem to be unaware of how the actual situation has progressed over the last decade, the last 3 Greek governments,  the surpluses achieved in a short period of time during attempted reforms, the negative effects of privatization, capital flight, etc.
There is also the issue of you thinking that German or other EU taxpayers are being asked to bail out Greece. The ECB run the Greek central banks. Those banks have gotten over 1/3 of all bailout assets for recapitalization goals. Interest earned on Greek money is being held by the ECB. The Greek people didn&#x27;t need any of this to live. They grow more food than you do in Germany, and the entire economic game was set-up in Benelux, Germany, France, etc, anyway, and the Greek economy was never at their level in the first place, and so a common currency was filled with lots of German Submarine deals etc. Look at your auto industry. I live in Portugal. We don&#x27;t make any cars here anymore, except so-called-German-ones (VW) or French ones. The profit chain always leads back up north.

Theres a whole cultural thing of not blocking other peoples access, a legal framework of not blocking sidewalks, when its OK to share, or not share, someones extension cord, stuff like that.  Its just not a serious issue.  The cost of one parking spot was rolled into my bachelor pad, but when space was available I could get another spot for $25/mo or whatever it was, surely a charger spot would have some minor additional costs, but chargers are pretty cheap compared to land and pavement and buildings.<p>I guess the only technological limitation I can think of is service drop size, if you wire up 200 parking stalls at 25 KW each you&#x27;re probably going to have to upgrade the service drop or implement something &quot;interesting&quot; involving partial charge rates.  Presumably someone will start shipping an apartment charger that can bluetooth pair with its neighboring chargers and cooperate such that the total average draw of the entire lot never exceeds 100 KW or something like that.  100 KW is a drop in the bucket for an apartment building, thats like 1000 watts worth of TVs or lights in each of 100 apartments.  Dinner time on a hot summer night is a large multiple of that draw.<p>House service drops used to be just 60 amps a few decades ago and now 200 is pretty standard... if you think service drop upgrades for a house are expensive, imagine the cost of an entire apartment building upgrade LOL.

The Iranian President or Ayatollah is often portrayed as a dictator, but the reality is quite a bit more complicated than that. Iran has a functional civil service, with the office of the President, a parliament, and independent judiciary. Presidential candidates are vetted by the theocracy, but are elected in pretty legitimate elections. Though the theocracy pulls a lot of strings, the civil government has significant autonomy in areas such as economic policy and the routine administration of justice. And theocracy itself at least as elements that could evolve into a more liberal system. The Supreme Leader is elected by the Assembly of Experts, who are themselves elected by public vote.<p>Most importantly, Iranians <i>are used to and expect</i> those hallmarks of modern civilization. That makes them very different from the people who live in the other Middle Eastern theocracies, who, prior to establishment of the monarchies, did not have nations with functioning national governments and civil services. Those attitudes towards government are what enable friendships between countries, moreso than relatively transitory conflicts. For example, the U.K., France, and Germany live relatively harmoniously within the structure of the EU, even though as recently as 70 years ago, they killed millions of each others&#x27; people.<p>I don&#x27;t want to whitewash Iran (it&#x27;s still a place that executes homosexuals, after all). But I think it&#x27;s important to look at the example of England, the originator of modern western democracy. It evolved very methodically from a divine-right monarchy into a liberal democracy. It did so because it had the political structures in place to enable that transition. Long before the monarch was relegated to ceremonial status, the civil government was actually running the show. Countries like Saudi Arabia do not have that. Their governments are intimately tied up in their monarchies. Iran, on the other hand, does have the structures in place to enable a successful transition into democracy.",1436880947

It&#x27;s an extremely comfortable luxury car that seats 5 and can easily be driven across the country<p>How much did that Lexus cost new?<p>How much will a used Tesla go for in a few years?<p>> and can easily be driven across the country<p>Yes, NOW. But, you didn&#x27;t read the article (or your reading comprehension sucks). If 10% of the cars on the road become electric, at least 10% of the gas stations will start to close (since that business is barely profitable), making it increasingly less convenient to own a gas car.<p>> A new electric car [1], on the other hand, costs approximately the same but can only seat 2 people and can travel 160 km on one charge.<p>Yeah, <i>today.</i> What about in 5-10 years?<p>You consistently use <i>current</i> state to argue against <i>future</i> state.

In that time they will lose only 10-15% of their total charging capacity.<p>> True, it is convenient for trips around town without much luggage.<p>Using electric motors over gas engines is a HUGE space savings. Again, see: Tesla. (You really need to see one of these up close and drive one. It may be the only thing that will &quot;show you the light.&quot;)<p>> I&#x27;m fairly confident that the used Lexus will outlast and outrun the new electric car.<p>Nope, because the ICE (internal combustion engine) and transmission has hundreds or thousands more parts (any of which can break) than an electric transmission. The Tesla only has ONE GEAR, for example. Teslas, and other electrics with 3-phase AC induction motors, will last faaaaaaaaaaaaaaar longer than gas powered cars. I&#x27;ve seen 60 year old electric motors running like a top, and in googling the reliability of electric motors, they are far higher than gas motors. Coupled with the &quot;tipping point&quot; effect of many gas stations closing up due to lack of business, that cross-country trip will end up needing to be routed through available stations one day...<p>Did I mention that a Tesla, going the same distance as an ICE vehicle, has 1/3 the carbon footprint.<p>Source: I own a Tesla Model S P85+ and fully expect this thing to still be in tip top shape in 10 years while continuing to run circles around gas cars (ohhhh, I can&#x27;t wait till you experience simply <i>passing people by at speed</i> in this thing... you think the thought and it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re a pinball coming off caroms to your destination...)",1436880937

I think we&#x27;re wire to enjoy it. If you had a judo lesson now and learned a simple trip, you would have fun. Give most people their first programming lesson and they&#x27;ll enjoy jumbling up letters or whatever you do.<p>Not knowing is unpleasant. In your first lesson you have no expectation. In the second, you <i>double</i> your knowledge. On the 20th, you are dealing with forgetting and you&#x27;ve accumulated bits you find difficult. You are still a beginner, but now you have expectations.<p>You can trip or throw a cooperative opponent but you keep repeating mistakes, frustration. There is still a gulf between where you are and scoring on an uncooperative opponent. You can jumble words, add numbers or record form data in your db. But, the gulf between doing that and writing your spaced learning iWatch app is big. Basically, you suck and you are judging your performance by the standards of a programmer, judo player or whatnot. Sucking.. sucks.<p>I&#x27;m about 5 weeks into learning a language and I&#x27;m in this spot right now. week one was really fun. Every lesson meaningfully improved my vocal, grammar, etc. I know about 1200 words and a decent amount of the basic grammar. You need about 2500 words before you can understand a simple paragraph or video snippet. I&#x27;m nearly useless outside of the context f a lesson translating single sentences. I can&#x27;t think in the language (I translate) which means (A) it&#x27;s difficult and frustrating and (B) I might understand your first sentence as you wrap up your third…even if I know all the words. None of the gammer is natural to me. etc. etc.<p>Basically, there&#x27;s a massive gap between where I am and where it felt like I would now after the first lesson. Massive. Even if I conjure up discipline I didn&#x27;t need in week 1 and push hard this week, I&#x27;ll still suck. My vocal might go up to 1500, but I&#x27;ll regress on something. It&#x27;s whack-a-mole time where revision is 75% of the work and 50 new words is a drop in the ocean.<p>Thinking of it, I realize I might have taken the wrong side of the debate. Learnings sucks. I hate it.<p>But, for the sake of it I&#x27;ll keep arguing this point. This expectation/reality gap is as irrational as it is inevitable. You know it how long it will to learn things in advance. I know I can&#x27;t get fluent in a language in 25 hours of practice, but it does create frustration.<p>Since I&#x27;m not going with the &quot;learning sucks, I hate it&quot; conclusion, lets wrap up with stoicism. Good as any, ne? Do thy duty though the the skies fall down upon thee. Seek not vain pleasures of the moment. Rather, take comfort each day knowing that thou hath done thy work. Focusing on your goals to much can make learning emotionally hard (frustrating, etc.), unless your goal can be achieved very quick. If your goal requires 100 hours over 2 months, when you are 46 hours deep, you  feel like you aren&#x27;t making any progress. You are probably wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it. Don&#x27;t focus on the end goal, just do your 2 hours and pat yourself on the head. Good stoic. Nice stoic. Here&#x27;s a Senecan biscuit. Well done.",1436879522

I am not an overly competitive person and already have a decent job where people respect me and my abilities as a programmer, yet I rarely spend a waking moment not thinking about all the things I could be grokking.<p>I guess what it boils down to is that a lot of my self esteem is derived from being knowledgable and resourceful.

For example, when I was learning Angular a few years ago, I knew going into it that I wouldn&#x27;t &quot;get it&quot; right away.

I wasn&#x27;t 100% successful, but it did help me block out some of the cognitive dissonance.<p>The only other thing I&#x27;d say is that even though this is frustrating, I like to think that your anxiety is actually a good thing if you learn to channel it constructively.

that the Iraqi weapons declaration filed on December 7 &quot;is essentially a reorganized version&quot; of information Iraq provided UNSCOM in 1997, and that it &quot;is not enough to create confidence&quot; that Iraq has abandoned its WMD efforts.  So the US was not alone in that position.<p>and<p>Hans Blix states that Iraq still has not made a &quot;fundamental decision&quot; to disarm, despite recent signs of increased cooperation. Specifically, Iraq has refused to destroy its al-Samoud 2 long range missiles. (These are not a WMD, and Iraq is permitted &quot;battlefield&quot; missiles. However, Iraq&#x27;s missiles were limited by UN instruction to a diameter of 600mm, and the Al-Samoud II has a diameter of 760mm). These missiles are deployed and mobile. Also, an R-400 aerial bomb was found that could possibly contain biological agents. Given this find, the UN Inspectors have requested access to the Al-Aziziyah weapons range to verify that all 155 R-400 bombs can be accounted for and proven destroyed. Blix also expresses skepticism over Iraq&#x27;s claims to have destroyed its stockpiles of anthrax and VX nerve agent in Time magazine. Blix said he found it &quot;a bit odd&quot; that Iraq, with &quot;one of the best-organized regimes in the Arab world,&quot; would claim to have no records of the destruction of these illegal substances. &quot;I don&#x27;t see that they have acquired any credibility,&quot; Blix said",1436879316

Any better than this?<p><pre><code>  <button icon=&quot;user&quot; text=&quot;Add Friend&quot;>

Regardless of how &quot;safe&quot; I might feel or not, I&#x27;m considering crowdfunding to continue my work and hope it&#x27;ll keep someone else in their position.

The reason the majority of the third world countries never aligned was because they couldn't field a worthwhile military for a cold-war era threat, the vast majority of them still can't.<p>The idea that the US could fall so far from grace that it would be incapable of fielding a military is a much, much bigger thing than people imagine. Due to the size and natural resources of the US it fundamentally has an economic bottom line, despite all the economy going to crap it will still have access to raw materials to make a sufficient military to stand with its allies.<p>Many African countries have next to nothing in terms of established economy, or likely establishable economy. With little access to water, little access to raw materials and little access to arable land, there is quite literally zero hope for improvement, these countries by nature would be trapped in importing natural resources and exporting products, which is something no country has solely survived off.<p>For the US to ever reach third-world poverty, it would have to have almost zero access to clean water, zero access to natural resources and zero access to arable land. By virtue of americas geographical location, it is physically impossible for it to have no arable land and no clean water unless rain never falls again.<p>The simple notion that the US could fall so far is quite absurd, you might as well be arguing that overnight your dog turned into a cat. Unless there's a fundamental change in the ordering of the universe, a dog will never become a cat, and unless there's a fundamental change in the ecological systems of the earth (I'm talking <i>WAY</i> beyond global warming bullshit, the US has been habitable through ice ages and periods when Antarctica had plant life; I'm talking a dinosaur-killer required to make it uninhabitable) the US will never sink to third-world poverty.<p>Simply put, unless we change the fundamental ecological system of the planet well beyond recognition in any way or form as to what has existed before or in the short-term future, the US will still be a thriving country with a massive population. It might not be a world-hub of technological development, but it'll still be on a map. Of first world countries there is a whole host of countries that aren't known for any real technological development, but because of expert use of natural resources over a century or more, they still have excellent wealth and development.<p>As the old saying goes, it takes money to make money. Right now the US is still harvesting gold and diamonds out of its land, and is also harvesting black gold, most of these industries alone are more profitable than almost any of the poverty stricken countries in Africa. Zimbabwe has a GDP of ~3 billion, if it was a company we'd be talking about it being bought out by Google/Apple/Microsoft for $30bil and what they plan to do with it.

Then, when you leave, they just get another intern and this goes on and on.<p>So you'd ask ""why are people falling for this?"" and the answer is quite simple: there's too many people who'd like to work on culture but it's not a gold mine for companies so they can't pay even if they wanted to. So you keep accepting internships to get a better CV but it never stops. I can't count the number of friends I have in this situation for years and years.

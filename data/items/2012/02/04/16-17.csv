Even Windows, where OEM is more important for desktop than server and the whole lot of different channels that sell server software, be it Windows, SQL, Exchange, Dynamics... It's hopelessly confusing.<p>Telling them ""you are a software company"" won't give a coherent strategy that encompasses both OEMs for Windows Home and enterprises for multi-license packs of Windows, Office, Windows Server, SQL, Exchange, Dinamics, Sharepoint and so on. And would not help the very promising ecosystem around the Xbox.<p>I think they'd be better off had the DoJ ordered the company to be broken into smaller pieces.",1328374680

LA Noire was a long, expensive project headed up by Team Bondi. TB has since folded, mainly due to mismanagement and going crazily over-budget, but they weren't the only people working on it.

3551389,comment,3550415,3551319,2,0,dasil003,,,"Not sure if you read Derek Webb's article, but he makes the case that piracy is better for musician's than Spotify, because with Spotify people have paid for it so the artist never stands a chance of making significant money from a fan, whereas with piracy the will have the internal understanding that they haven't really given anything to the artist, and eventually they may decide to buy an album.<p>As easy as it is to hate the big bad RIAA, it's a red herring.  Musicians are under no obligation to support any particular business model.  And contrary to what you say, if every musician puts their music on Spotify, then Spotify becomes the obvious consumer choice, and that sets a maximum value that music is worth, and that value is orders of magnitude less than it can be worth under the iTunes model.  Musicians don't have to put their music into Spotify though, and as long as significant numbers of them don't then the higher value market for music can still exist.  Piracy is definitely inevitable, and I believe it's a waste of time to try to fight it at the individual scale, but there is no reason artists have to bend over and accept a fraction-of-a-penny pay-per-stream model as inevitable.",1328374495

You just have writer's block, and your writing probably isn't as good as you're describing it in the first place, so don't get too hung up about it.<p>And before you get defensive, let me tell you, if you pursue writing professionally, you'll learn this on your own pretty quickly. A critic or a professor will knock you on your ass and show you flaws in your work you'd never even considered. I don't care how much of a prodigy you are, you have a lot to learn.<p>The way you treat writer's block is through attrition. Just keep writing. No professional writer in the universe ever made it on talent alone, and the secret they all have is that they just write, a lot, every day, whether they feel like it or whether they think it's any good or not.<p>Also, this: ""My vocabulary was wide and far-ranging, and I often utilized five to six different words, all synonyms, to re-iterate the same point in an argument..."" is a feature, not a bug.

It's experiencing logistical growth (i.e, following a logistical function rather than an exponential function). We've just been seeing the first half of the curve, which does approximate exponential growth.<p>But we're starting to see it turn around. In the most developed countries, fertility has dropped to replacement or lower. As the remaining countries develop, their fertility rates are also dropping. It's reasonable to extrapolate from this that at some point in the future, the global fertility rate will be at or below replacement.<p>The constraints are microeconomic. It's expensive to raise children, especially when you factor in opportunity costs (this part is key to why world population won't stabilize at starvation levels).

There is a lack of ability by the lead to guide the team to sanity.<p>Here's what I see needs to be done:<p>* Stop using agile if you don't have buy in from the owners.  Agile is much more dangerous than traditional methods if you do not have the right buy-in from the owners--and that buy-in is not easy to get. Without buy-in, you've just given them the ability to minutely control the expected output without the expense of researching and designing a base set of functionality up-front. It's ""free"" for them to change their mind--so they will, at your expense.<p>* Tell the lead to stop being a robot. Alice is given a task that is blocked by an old bug. Instead of just assigning a more suitable task to Alice, she is told to bring in another developer to help her work through it. Why stick with this task? The world isn't binary, so break up your task and assignments into something that fits the talent you have.<p>Yes, developers are not fungible completely, but there should be tasks that anyone should be able to slip in and do. It's the lead's role to be able to decide which tasks are assignable to someone new with reduced risk. Maybe start them out on just identifying the cause for Bug XXX--not actually fixing the code. Or have them confirm and document repro steps for the bugs that are coming in every day. You don't have to always give developers development tasks, especially their first week.<p>* Tell the lead to start taking care of the team. The story mentions developers who got pulled into meetings, preventing them from doing their job. As a lead, you should be providing some interference and getting in the way of these type of requests.<p>* Tell the lead to stop over complicating things. Why are there so many bugs? Part of this is that the employees are overworked. I suspect that part of it is also that the framework and processes are over-complicated. A custom build of a tool that completely breaks everything? That's a process smell. The lead needs to figure out why its so easy to introduce bugs in their system. ""The requirements are all necessary"" phrase also fall into the implementation as well. Think YAGNI and KISS.<p>As for the loss of productivity by ""Alice"": every new developer adds growing pains to a team, but that definitely should not persist. It's a short-sighted view that one week of lost productivity will erase any long-term benefits of an additional employee. But, you need to plan training time for a new employee into your schedule.

Some people I work with tried to guess my upbringing and guessed raised Catholic and now never goes to church. I told them that I was raised atheist and now you'll find me at church every Sunday. People were fairly surprised. I don't meet too many people who go to church around here so it's rare and I understand their reaction. They were all nice to me about it though.<p>All that said I think atheists run into the problem of not their behavior but rather the behavior of ""that guy"". You know him. Maybe you are him. It's ""that guy who can't shut up and says insulting things about people who believe in anything spiritual at all"" But ""that guy"" is a pain to be around. I worked with ""that guy"" once and hearing him compare my beliefs to the flying spaghetti monster was pretty ignorant and if I valued his opinion more than I do would have been insulting. He would repeat this week after week seemingly escalating his rhetoric to upset me. I have long since worked out how I feel about all this so I held my own just fine. My only point in mentioning him is that for another person this might have been pretty annoying and upsetting.<p>I've run into ""that guy"" on multiple occasions-enough to notice who he is and steer clear at parties and at work.

Node's creator spent considerable time doing just that in C and Ruby before starting on Node, in fact.<p>However, creating a working solution does not free you of problems. Being bound to an obtuse language or API, for instance, is still a problem. One that will continue to haunt you for as long as the application lives.<p>Java Struts was, once upon a time, the framework of choice for web development. While it solved some problems, it created a whole new set of its own. A little known character, DHH, laughed at it and set out to build something better. While Java can produce a web application as well as any other, Rails became a big hype machine because it solved problems people had on the implementation side.<p>I recall EventMachine had a little bit of hype before Node came along, but it didn't solve the problem very well. Few supporting libraries supported asynchronous operation and the language just didn't feel right. I imagine your Java libraries suffer the same problem, and that is why they never saw much hype either.<p>Javascript, on the other hand, was designed to be asynchronous from the beginning. It had the perfect expressiveness for the job, and the libraries were all built to work in the environment. That is what made Node interesting, and why the hype followed.

3551317,comment,3549802,3550964,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> You are right about people just moving projects in and out. Another option is to follow Cloud9's lead and have public projects for free and private available to premium. There are other things to limit like number of collaborators however its quite important to me personally to let as many people use this as possible. People do spend a lot of time on the site which might make adds an interesting alternative, but I would rather not muddy up the site with them. Any ideas are very welcome.<p>Please do remember that you've created something awesome here, and you should try to make some money from it. :)  I realize you want as many users as possible, but when designing your premium features you need to select things that some significant subset of people will want enough to pay for.  I certainly want to pay you for this, but if you give me everything I need for free that makes it harder. :)<p>In particular, as a user I want you to make money from this so I'll feel confident that it'll stick around.<p>The private/public distinction makes a lot of sense.  It might also work to just allow a single private non-collaborative repository, which would suffice for a user who rarely uses collaboration to try the service (since they can delete and add projects at will), while anyone doing collaboration on a private project with several other people will want those people to have the ability to edit at any time, and thus they can't take down the project to work on something else.<p>Freemium does seem <i>highly</i> preferable to ads, here.  I won't say that you couldn't make a decent amount on ads, but I don't think they'll work nearly as well for you, given both the target audience and the amount of resources each user needs.<p>I do think you have the right idea about git: supporting arbitrary repositories would help power users, but allowing read-only access to a one-branch git repo goes a long way with relatively little effort.  Your priorities seem entirely sensible. :)<p>By the way, how do you plan to scale?  A single compilation of a large document takes multiple seconds of CPU-bound computation even on a dedicated system; what happens when you have even a few hundred simultaneous free users?  That suggests a very sensible possibility for premium accounts: any kind of real-time previewing or fast compilation would go in the premium category, while free users get to click the ""PDF"" button and wait in line for a brief period.  (Browsershots and similar services follow this model.)  You'd still provide a huge amount of value for free users, who can collaborately edit for a while and then hit ""PDF"" and wait a bit for the result.  Meanwhile, in my case I compile several times a minute by hitting a single editor keystroke and having the PDF viewer in the other window automatically update, and I'd happily pay to make the delay go away, given the collaborative features here.<p>On a closely related note, I think this would work most effectively if you allow one user to pay and then invite other collaborators to edit a document.  A couple months ago, I needed to prepare a presentation with two other people elsewhere in the world.  After a failed attempt to use Gobby (non-trivial for one of the collaborators to install the current version on OS X), I ended up using one of the various EtherPad sites floating around to edit the TeX source, and repeatedly grabbing the entire document and running pdflatex locally to get a preview.  I still had to clean up the document by hand afterward due to broken TeX formatting, since other collaborators didn't have the ability to compile.  If I could have paid to make that problem go away, and just handed a link to my two collaborators, I <i>gladly</i> would have.<p>Which raises an interesting question: does this make more sense as a monthly service, or as an ""ow ow ow this hurts here's some money make it stop"" service with a more pay-as-you-go model?  I edit LaTeX documents often enough to use a service like this quite frequently, but not so often that I wouldn't have a month go by without doing so, which hurts when paying for a monthly service.  Perhaps something like $small for a few days (for the initial ""ow this hurts"" use case), and a reasonable multiple of $small for a year (for the case where you expect to use it repeatedly).  When you stop paying, your documents stick around (because a bit of text costs you almost nothing to store), but the private collaboration and fast unqueued compilation/preview goes away.<p>How does that sound?",1328372813

Add Anachronox, which was mediocre at best.<p>- Ensemble Studios was closed by Microsoft with no specific reason, most likely due to a shift of focus, after multiple really successful releases, piracy or not. Also, Halo Wars didn't get a lot of praise.<p>- Core Design is praised for Tomb Raider I and hated for running the series into the ground release by release.

Those tools helps you spot potential mistake and help your code be a little better. What they give you is advice, you will find that from time to time the advice they give you aren't that great and you are always free to ignore them in those cases.",1328371618

Nothing you do is ever set in stone, regardless of age and everyone goes through changes. Teens go through changes that are a more volatile.<p>Try reframing it in your head. Personally, it seems like you're just ""not into"" writing right now. There's nothing wrong with that. There could be a deeper root cause, but I doubt you'll truly find it.<p>Keep writing (I guess you'll have to) and things may clear themselves up. Self awareness isn't always a great thing ;)",1328371522

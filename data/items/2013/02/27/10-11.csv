Not to mention a new trouble when they have a solution but can't apply it with programming, because the technical barrier they had, even you use easy programming tools like Alice, certainly there will be technical problem for them.<p>I agree with, why we should learn kids problem-solving skill, because they just need their brain and basic tools like pencil and paper, maybe to scratch something, to visualize what they think.",1361962394

Anything else would be a mathematical impossibility.<p>> I think someone did this experiment, of reencoding a jpg multiple times to see what happens, and of course, after some iterations you only get a blob<p>> Because it's lossy compression, you can only do this once or twice without noticeable loss<p>This is besides the point though and makes things a bit more confusing :)<p>Because of the Pigeonhole Principle you must chose, .. actually there is no choice, in order to lose bits (file size), you have to dump some bits (information).<p>However, what you describe is generation-loss, and there is nothing about lossy compression that forces you to have generation-loss, it just depends on the codec. JPG does it, most audio and video codecs also do it. But using 2x2 sampling blocks is <i>also</i> lossy compression (x4 compression!!), but it only applies the first time: using 2x2 sampling blocks on something that's already pixelated won't change it anymore, and of course neither will it compress it any further.<p>> Now, of course, they're probably assuming you took the video, compressed it one time and then submitted it to them<p>""Took the video"", from where though?

I'd phrase my own rebuttal like this:<p>If you repeatedly apply lossy compression to a video, you'll find that the video either very quickly balloons or becomes a blocky or blurry mess. The encoder ends up spending bitrate to preserve compression artifacts, and the bit bill keeps growing. This is something that x264, even in its efficiency, can't get around, and if Beamr is just tweaking x264's setting knobs, it doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of doing better.<p>If Beamr is just offering a fire-and-forget solution to tweaking x264's settings, they should just say so and provide some hard counterevidence to Daiz's report. There's no shame in trying to offer a tweaked encoding service, but they'd better be able to back it up when challenged by evidence.<p>Making statements that are technically unlikely or impossible hurts the speaker's credibility and chances of garnering goodwill.

I've spent more time than I care to recall trying to get Python 2.x to handle Unicode correctly.<p>I only mention this because it's a visible change that's easy to explain in a few words. The more basic changes are mostly subtle and difficult to describe without direct experience.<p>> but I don't see anything new than, when programming in Python 2x, makes me think ""oh, if only I had used Python 3 here!"".<p>That's not a very sound basis for comparative evaluation. If you have only ever owned a horse, the advantages of owning a car might not be obvious. The horse can go places the car cannot, so the fact that the car gets to other places faster might be overlooked.",1361959740

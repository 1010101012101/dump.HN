487301,comment,486163,486868,0,0,time_management,,,"I would remark that the punishment of the defendants has been uneven and had more to do with whose identities were recoverable than who did anything wrong. About half the defendants were people who made one off-hand comment (e.g. ""Get in line"") and are now suffering extremely disproportionate consequences. Ciolli (Great Teacher Onizuka) didn't even take part in this behavior at all-- he was an outed lawyer-- and he lost his job over this. This smacks of opportunistic target-seeking.<p>On the other hand, posters like Pauliewalnuts, lonelyvirgin, and :D bordered on being sociopathic and I feel like those guys are getting what was coming to them. I also think there's an enormous difference between, for example, expressing desire to have sex with someone (locker-room banter) and making jokes about becoming forceful with that person, which most women would take as a threat.",1235055539

The dictionary's job is to tell us how words are used, not to describe the nature of reality. As I said, even using the word <i>technology</i> to describe a cell phone is beginning to sound stilted -- kids will probably roll their eyes. Calling a wooden sailing ship <i>high technology</i> sounds like a joke [3], and calling a flint arrowhead <i>technology</i> would just be silly.

Of course I tend to look for substance in the good comments as well as the bad. (hyperaware of how easy it is for a business to succumb to selling itself through 'fake' comments; aware of the fact that everyone has bad nights and competitors) More than ever these days (I have IB back in high school to thank for starting me down this road): understand that every source has bias.<p>2. Yelp, to me at least, has shifted power into the hands of the consumer. It is now possible to hear, theoretically, what the users of a business (refer to 1.) think of it - good or bad. This, I would think, would make a few people unhappy - changes in power usually do. And complaining about being unhappy at 'power to the consumer' isn't really a story that is going to get much sympathy.<p>3. Yelp's business involves a trusting user. To undermine that by allowing businesses to remove negative reviews for a sum of money strikes me as being very short sited. Everything gets out eventually, especially in this day and age. In conjunction with 2., the best attack against Yelp (or the most effective) would be an attack on whether or not you can trust Yelp. Again, I can't see Yelp 'offing' itself like this - unless the team behind it really is that short sighted.<p>I like yelp, I find it useful and if/when it stops being useful, and if this story is true it won't be long till that happens, I'll stop using it.",1235052737

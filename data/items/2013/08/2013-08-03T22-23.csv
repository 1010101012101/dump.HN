6153704,comment,6152781,6153662,1,0,kevingadd,,,"I appreciate your detail here and I think I agree with some of your points. What is the source of your PoV on Canvas, though? From my history of using it and the other end users I&#x27;ve interacted with who use Canvas, I just don&#x27;t understand how someone could call it &#x27;extremely well thought through&#x27; as an API.<p>Canvas literally prioritized narrow support for things like <i>drop shadows</i> over support for basic, established rendering essentials like blending operations, well-specified clipping/sampling semantics, control over scaling, and basic image data filtering/transformation. Many of the obvious features Canvas is missing have been in SVG for years now, and have been in applications like Photoshop and in most game-oriented rendering libraries for decades. This is fine in an early vendor-driven prototype but the fact remains that even now many of those things I described are still not possible with Canvas, and Apple has no excuse: They needed only look at things real software did in rendering.<p>Canvas also remains an incredibly slow API <i>by specification</i>, not just due to poor luck of aligning badly with the GPU: The bread and butter drawImage operation is itself specified in a way that makes it considerably more expensive to implement (for general cases) than it needs to be, and I can only blame this on Apple&#x27;s PoV on rendering at the time infecting the design of the spec. There are other design decisions that unnecessarily cripple its use for image rendering and image processing; the need to render an image to a canvas and read it back just to get at pixel data is a big problem that is only now being addressed thanks to the valiant efforts of the WhatWG. Canvas&#x27;s incredibly poor performance also undermines any attempt to claim that Apple might have left key features out &#x27;to make it fast&#x27;. I will note that most browser vendors have gone to valiant efforts here to make Canvas fast, and they&#x27;ve done a good job - but it still performs terribly.<p>The Canvas API also has severe underspecification/poor specification problems when it comes to image quality concerns; its treatment of sampling/filtering (in particular when dealing with subrectangles) and its handling of color profiles/gamma are both hopelessly underspecified to the point that it is no longer possible to fix either of them without breaking applications that have accidentally relied on the arbitrary behavior of existing implementations.<p>HTML5 Canvas is unfit for: Realtime rendering scenarios, offline rendering scenarios, and &#x27;real&#x27; image processing/editing scenarios, among others.",1375569529

I recognised that you&#x27;d missed the original article&#x27;s point, which is that enterprise customers won&#x27;t adopt it.  If Google wants Dart to be of interest to more than tech startups or hobbyists, then ongoing support, patching, commitment from the vendor is ab-so-lute-ly necessary.  This is why Rails succeeded, for example.  And poor old godforsaken Java.<p>It&#x27;s just the reality of technology component selection for IT in the mundane non-tech-sector.<p>As for your tone in here:<p><i>expectation that Google will drop Dart is based on what exactly?

6153664,comment,6152781,6153315,7,0,cromwellian,,,"Dart and NaCL design are not happening behind closed doors, period. NaCL was first published as a research paper. All development since it was published has happened in the open. None of the popular languages today have been the designed the way you suggest. K&R designed C behind closed doors, ANSI C came later. Python, Ruby, Perl, JavaScript, the list goes on and on, all designed and prototyped first prior to any kind of standardization. Committee driven languages like C++ have shown to bloated monstrosities in terms of complexity. Creating a focus group and committee to design a language is the surest way to lead to failure or to compete with Duke Nukem Forever for delayed completion.<p>I have a nagging suspicion that many of these arguments are based around aesthetics and language chauvinism. The people who are super critical of Dart or NaCL are also the people who intersect with people with absolutely love Javascript, and dislike class-based OO and other paradigms. There is no such thing as a unified web community. Everyone has difference preferences and opinions on the way to write web apps. The forest through the trees is that consumers and developers today increasingly don&#x27;t care and are seeking out native, battery efficient, mobile applications. It&#x27;s an incredible threat to the Web, and all of this bickering over people&#x27;s attempts to find more performant ways of shipping apps within the Web model, but not use JS are IMHO, missing the point.  While Mozilla and others think the fight is against Dart and NaCL, Android Java and Objective-C are crushing on mobile. I have grave doubts that FirefoxOS + asm.js can rectify any of the core issues. The desktop is going bye bye.<p>Anyway, Dart was announced in 2011. It still isn&#x27;t finished and it has been changed radically since then based on community feedback from the needs of developers.<p>Everyone ships binary blobs to the Web today. Gmail is a binary blob. It&#x27;s a red herring.<p>I love the Web with all my heart. I don&#x27;t think JS is the Web. The Web is HTTP. It is URL. It is transparent content. RESTy semantics. It is indexable, federatable. You can ship JS based apps that I don&#x27;t think quality as very Webby.<p>My big fear is, 5-10 years from now, everyone is publishing &quot;sites&quot; that are app store distributed, and all information is siloed behind private repositories. Is asm.js going to stop that? Is it going to make mobile web apps as battery efficient, memory efficient, or performance efficient, with less jank, than iOS?

The development of the open web itself has consistently been a messy business. There&#x27;s a reason that the single-champion model has been adopted by several groups, including TC39: it works really well, and a lot of good standards have come out of it, whether on purpose (many recent specs) or not (many of the features we can thank old IE for). Even when things have been going great, people try to use committee maneuvering to torpedo things, or patent claims come out of the blue and suddenly you&#x27;re turning to a different champion for your touch events.<p>Pretending that we now have a one true way of developing the open web is silly, because it&#x27;s not even a little true.<p>> <i>The Canvas spec is a complete steaming pile of nonsense that again, has only been iteratively improved into a more useful state by the tireless efforts of the whatwg (and whoever was maintaining it before them, I don&#x27;t remember). Canvas delivers miserable performance and a crippled, arbitrary feature set that was clearly designed for the specific purpose of solving whatever problems Apple had at the time. Compare Canvas with WebGL, if you like: WebGL was developed in the open, based on an established, proven API that had been used to solve problems for decades, and it is quickly gaining on Canvas for many use cases due to that - even though it&#x27;s lower-level, harder to use, and less widely supported.</i><p>The canvas spec is extremely well thought through because it&#x27;s an API that was copied virtually verbatim from CoreGraphics/Quartz2d, which has a lineage that&#x27;s been hammered on since QuickDraw came on the scene. What it is, however, is out of date in a world that is constrained on bandwidth to the GPU, but has computation power to spare once there. Apple has worked hard to efficiently implement Quartz2d on top of modern GPUs, but, yes, it&#x27;s silly for everyone else to spend as much energy as they have bending over backwards for something inherently less efficient. The spec is slowly being brought up to speed.<p>Meanwhile, WebGL, which has indeed been a model of open development, would of course have been similarly hampered if it had come a little earlier and been based on OpenGL ES 1.0 (though less so than Canvas), but it also proves my point: Khronos is a famously <i>not</i> open standards body, incredibly bound by the patent and disclosure agreements that the member organizations require of them, and though the WebGL group has done more than admirably in that environment (even driving changes on what should be common-sense notions like conformance tests), the spec that WebGL is based on, OpenGL ES 2.0, was produced in that closed environment on private lists, and is especially favored because it <i>discards</i> its decades of legacy.<p>WebGL is &quot;gaining&quot; on canvas (whatever that means) because it enables a whole world of high performance effects (3d and otherwise) that were before impossible. And this largely <i>in spite</i> of the API, which was of course designed not to favor usability or abstract the hardware, but to be an efficient foundation for the type of libraries like three.js that have been driving the popularity.<p>> <i>You don&#x27;t have to announce a project the day you start working on it, and there&#x27;s a huge difference between announcing an idea or an initiative with a proof-of-concept and what Google did with NaCL and Dart, where something was announced along with the intent to ship it as a built in special-purpose binary blob in the browser and expose it to the web, regardless of the thoughts or intents of web standards folks and the community at large.</i><p>Neither of these things are true, and you don&#x27;t even have to search very hard to verify it. NaCl is the farthest from your description, as it <i>was</i> released as an initial proof of concept via a browser plugin[1] and even ran in Firefox, Safari, and Opera at the time. Pepper is what most open standards objections revolve around, as there has never (AFAIK) been an effort to standardize it in spite of its very long development time (beyond some early initial discussions with Mozilla[2]), but its actual development has indeed always been in the open as part of the chromium code base.<p>As for Dart, there was an initial &quot;surprise&quot; unveiling for the language, but my understanding is that there have been significant changes in the core libraries in response to community feedback (in the language itself as well? no idea). And, of course, there&#x27;s the small detail that it has never actually  shipped as a special-purpose binary blob in a browser and been exposed to the web. They certainly don&#x27;t get points for maybe someday moving Dart to a standards body, and so they certainly aren&#x27;t harming the web for maybe, someday shipping Dart in a browser.<p>[1] <a href=""http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2008/12/native-client-technology-for-running.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2008/12/native-client-technol...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=NPAPI:Pepper&oldid=275848"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=NPAPI:Pepper&oldid=...</a>",1375568860

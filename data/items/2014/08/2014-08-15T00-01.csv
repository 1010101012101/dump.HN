It allows creation and graphical editing (and graphical runtime debugging) of FSMs (though not hierarchical FSMs). It&#x27;s quite a good implementation of a FSM / event / action framework.

HTML and CSS were designed to allow different browsers to interoperate, specifically so that users could have a choice. The fact is that in a heterogeneous environment, not every browser will behave the same, and that is what web developers should accept. Instead of trying to make pages exactly the same in all browsers, the goal should be to make the informational content accessible. Even the CSS standard has provisions for user stylesheets.<p>I know this will not work for everything, especially app-like sites; but if web developers would do this for sites whose purpose is to provide information -- which is arguably one of the main goals of the Internet; then maybe it would be a better experience for all browsers, and we wouldn&#x27;t have such absurdities as static pages that require JS to display.",1408064018

It&#x27;s the enemy of privacy, security, and human dignity as well.<p>In the beginning there was the bubble. Well, actually there was DARPANet and such, but our story begins with the Internet bubble of the late 1990s.<p>In the early 90s the Internet hit mainstream. I was there. I got online (first by umm... borrowing accounts at my local university at 14) in 1992, then moved to a legal ISP when such things became available in my area. I basically watched the whole thing unfold.<p>When the Internet and the WWW went big there was a huge flurry of innovation, lots and lots of companies and open source efforts and various DIY projects and personal home pages and everything else.<p>The small scale stuff was -- and often could be -- a volunteer effort. To this day there are millions of independent sites and blogs and OSS projects. But the big stuff was expensive.<p>Building a site that is usable, content-rich, curated, and available for hundreds of millions of visitors is expensive. Building massive services like search engines is expensive. Building really high quality software is expensive. Making the gears turn is often the easy part... the polish that it takes to make something <i>great</i> often takes <i>at least</i> twice as long as it takes to do the &quot;techie&quot; stuff and get a working prototype.<p>There was always a search for ways to make it pay, ways to finance the new medium, but in the beginning it didn&#x27;t feel urgent. We were building the future, and damn the torpedoes. (By now I was doing it for my day job, so I was there in the trenches coding up early dynamic sites in PHP and Java, playing with Linux, hacking network code in C.)<p>Lots of things were tried: early freemium models, paywalls and subscriptions, and of course ads.<p>Only ads worked.<p>Freemium <i>can</i> work but only if your costs per user are super-low, which they aren&#x27;t for content creators or computationally expensive or bandwidth-heavy centralized services.<p>Paywalls and subscriptions? Nobody wanted to pay. Everyone wants free. Total failure.<p>Then the bubble popped and all the companies that couldn&#x27;t find a way to make it pay went out of business. The only ones left standing were those who used the Internet as a <i>secondary</i> channel (print magazines and such) and ad-driven sites and services.<p>But wait... it gets worse.<p>Ads work but they don&#x27;t. People, it turns out, hated intrusive ads, popup ads, and ad clutter in general. Ads were the only way to make the net pay (for most non-b2b businesses), but the more ads you have the uglier your site becomes. Back then they started calling it &quot;portalitis&quot; -- named after the buzz-word &quot;portal&quot; for sites like Yahoo and ICQ (remember that?) that became ad-encrusted messes.<p>Then Google appeared. They dropped everyone&#x27;s jaws when they launched with a search engine that not only worked but was incredibly <i>clean</i>. I remember seeing it... a text box and &quot;search.&quot; That&#x27;s it. Lots of people think PageRank was responsible for Google&#x27;s success, but I think the clean site was a lot of it... maybe as much as half of it.<p>The techies loved it. The users loved it. But the business folks, I&#x27;m sure, were like &quot;huh?!? how!!!?!?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure if Google planned their model or figured it out as they went, but eventually they did introduce ads. The ads were targeted, mixed into results and clearly marked. People clicked them because they were relevant. Genius. Google conquered the world.<p>Google also did something else. They demonstrated a new and now trendy Silicon Valley business approach: launch a free service everyone loves, get a <i>ton</i> of users, then figure out how to monetize.<p>It&#x27;s that approach combined with the information needed to underpin finer and finer grained ad targeting that led to the <i>real</i> disaster.<p>The real disaster wasn&#x27;t ads. Ads are fine. The real disaster was <i>surveillance as the business model of the Internet.</i><p>Facebook was the second massive company to follow in Google&#x27;s footsteps business-wise with launch first, get big, then monetize. Google kind of tiptoed into the surveillance business model by way of their ad targeting needs, but Facebook found that mass surveillance was the only way to really monetize. Again I&#x27;m not sure if Zuckerberg had this in mind from the get-go or not. I tend to think not. But how else do you monetize a massively expensive to run centralized social networking site where everyone just happens to post all kinds of personal data?<p>The Internet, which was supposed to be our great liberator and engine of learning, became George Orwell&#x27;s bidirectional TV set. It&#x27;s a TV set that watches <i>you.</i><p>... and it all goes back to free.<p>The need to be free (as in beer) has led to a dystopian nightmare. That&#x27;s because I&#x27;m sorry folks, but <i>nothing is actually free</i>. It has to be paid for somehow. Governments do it with taxes. But private entities? They&#x27;ve had to get creative.<p>Unless we somehow challenge &quot;free,&quot; I think it&#x27;s only going to get worse. Surveillance will get worse. Google Glass failed but it&#x27;s not the end... pretty soon there will be an effort to normalize the idea of your smartphone turning on its microphone and listening to your conversations. That data will be mined for product name drops.<p>I&#x27;m sure more creative ideas will be explored. I had a nightmarish thought the other night.<p>Full text analysis and meaning extraction is getting good, and it&#x27;s only going to get better in the future. How long will it be before Google Docs, Dropbox, etc. start data mining the documents stored on their systems and extracting valuable... umm... information?<p>Picture this: you&#x27;re writing a novel. It&#x27;s a really original plot. Then you see an ad for a Hollywood movie. It is your novel, verbatim. The characters are different but the basic plot points are all there. The story is there.<p>Gotta monetize those data storage services somehow!<p>I&#x27;ve started to even wonder if free (as in beer) open source needs to go. The idea that software should be free means that only software that isn&#x27;t free gets polished to the level that anyone uses it. The market expectation that software should be free leads software writers to look for <i>other</i> ways to monetize, which brings us back to surveillance and data mining. Look at some of the creepy stuff mobile apps can do, for example.<p>Pay for it, or it pays for you.",1408062386

I&#x27;m focusing on UX specifically.<p>My design has a REST endpoint that runs locally, and a JS client/SDK then connects to it on a known endpoint. My &quot;MVP&quot; version is to have the user running an interface with the request queue in a separate tab, and the server always at a fixed localhost:port endpoint. The client page would then issue a REST request that hangs until the user responds to the request in the separate tab.<p>This would conceivably work as a browser plugin as well since I&#x27;m planning to write it in JS for Node--basically the server logic would instead live in the plugin and the SDK would check for presence of the plugin before making a REST call. IMO the advantage of making it a REST endpoint though, is protecting private keys from whatever else might be going on in the browser process(es)--based on my own worst-case on assumptions, unsure if it&#x27;s actually an issue with the plugin architectures.<p>I&#x27;m an aspiring interaction/UX designer so that is the aspect I am focusing on, and my motivation is that I am personally starting to use GPG with a Yubikey + offline master.

These make e-mail extremely useful despite all of its shortcomings. Consider for example IM services. They multiply like mushrooms these days, yet most of them completely lack federation and therefore are crippled if you look at them globally. You can&#x27;t communicate with users of other services at all (unless you register there as well which defeats the purpose of decentralization). XMPP attempted to solve it, but unlike e-mail most participants on the IM scene were too selfish to fix the situation, including Google who deserted.<p><i>> How is this different from email?

I.e. you send a message and the other participant receives it through the e-mail service. In social networks (even decentralized ones), the delivery of such notifications is delegated to... e-mail. Which shows their intrinsic deficiency. They aren&#x27;t implementing the full scope of the communication process. I.e. if you envision a better social network, it should be decentralized but also take care of the delivery of the interactions in one coherent experience in order not to rely on other external tools for that.<p>E-mail isn&#x27;t fully decentralized most of the time, but it still can be (you can run your own e-mail server).

Human reproduction is not a random consumer product, but an integral part of the continuation of human societies. Therefore, society puts in place a social system to ensure that kids can be raised, educated, etc., but does not put in place a system to ensure widespread Ferrari ownership.",1408061411

Accumulating riches via conquest is almost always a myth, because armies a) destroy much that is of value and b) are unbelievably expensive.<p>&quot;Wealth through superior firepower&quot; has hardly ever been achieved. Even Rome mostly got rich through trade after its armies conquered Europe and North Africa, and a lawful peace was imposed. Had everyone been economically rational pretty much the same end could have been achieved through trade (spoiler: not everyone is economically rational.)<p>Simple looting of the kind the Spanish engaged in in the New World was never a very good path to wealth, partly because its first effect was to create massive inflation (if you use gold as money and inject vase amounts of gold into your economy without increased productive capacity, you get inflation, not wealth.)<p>So the conditions of gaining wealth by war are very, very narrowly defined. It&#x27;s not impossible, but it&#x27;s amazingly difficult.<p>There are defensible moral reasons for engaging in mass organized violence--I support the current American efforts to kill people in Northern Iraq, for example--but economic rationality (profitability) is never one of them, because the first step to creating wealth is never to engage in the wholesale destruction of everything the creation of wealth depends on.",1408061350

Which is interesting because even though I can get my TV shows and movies for free online I do pay for it with a subscription to Netflix and Hulu.<p>Maybe the difference is that I see news as temporary. Once I read it I want newer information, not really to go back to old news. Certain long form articles I bookmark but I find I rarely even go back to those. With TV Shows and Movies I can always go back and get some enjoyment from re-watching. Maybe the news doesn&#x27;t have that lasting value that I feel justifies spending that I do for other forms of medium of information such as books.<p>I think for me to pay for news it has to not be easily reproduced by someone else. You just can&#x27;t easily make a similar hit sitcom or breaking bad as can others retell what is happening in the world.

And yet at the same time, all four are eventually shown to be ""considered harmful"" - the only ones who advance are those who are willing to abandon the first things they learn while the rest are doomed to mediocrity.<p>Now don't get me wrong, I don't think PHP or even BASIC is inherently bad (well, they <i>are</i>, but at least they're not MUMPS or Brainfuck).

Indeed I have heard the same comparisons for CPU/GPU/Sound Cards becoming soldered onto the main board. (Along with a myriad of obsolete components that users were certain they wanted to upgrade.)<p>There was a period back when computers were around 16Mhz that you could reliably keep a machine for many years and progressively upgrade it. The speed of progress has increased significantly since then, it's unlikely that you'll be able to find appropriate hardware for your machine by the time software has rendered it obsolete.<p>To break up the argument a bit:<p>- Soldered ram doesn't devalue the product, or present a less serious computer user. It reflects the reality that most people don't upgrade. This forum will definitely have a skew towards tinkerers, but it's not representative of the market, and there are already a slew of products to serve this consumer.
- If it's broken outside of warranty there are indeed many avenues for low cost repair, even though this has a small chance of even occurring.
- The cost of maxing out the ram is on par with market pricing.
- Giving the user upgrade choices at purchase time is a better route than trying to hunt down parts later on. All computers become obsolete, minor spec upgrades won't stop this.<p>This is what incremental change looks like, ram being a quick solution for computing woes has reached the point of irrelevancy and 16GB of ram is certainly appropriate for the gamut of uses of such a device. Most speed gains experienced on this hardware will be the result of the SSD.",1339627988

4108875,comment,4105768,4105768,3,0,goforit,,,"By becoming dependent on ""IDE's"" you are only making it easier for companies to control you.  As developers you are important and companies want to have some control over what you do.  That was Microsoft's original plan and it has worked beautifully.<p>They were quick to provide an OO environment where someone could create something ""impressive"" very fast.  A little eye candy is all it takes to impress many developers and users.  
And that's all she wrote.  They beat everyone else to the punch.  To this day, IDE's and OO programming still rule.  And MS's mysterious API's are still very much a competitive advantage, tying programmers to the MS IDE and platform.  They control you.<p>The unfortunate result of this over a long period is that today's developers are a lot less knowledgeable about how to build things from the ground up.  Take away their IDE and they can't really do much.<p>If you want to create something truly ""new"" and push the envelope (think systems programming), then you need to start at a lower level than the IDE where someone else has handled the low level details for you.  (Who built those objects anyway?)  A recent post here on HN said that the most talented programmers are the ones who can move from different levels of abstraction effortlessly.  From very high to very low and back again.  The IDE keeps you in a box.  One level of abstraction.  Dirty low level details are scary to many developers.<p>IDE's are useful.  They increase productivity exponentially.  But if we take away your IDE and you are helpless without it, that's a problem from a progress standpoint (e.g. new systems development).  Companies like MS are controlling you and controlling the rate of progress.  And they have an incentive to maintain status quo.  The envelope does not get pushed.",1339627663

You first write your username and password and the server responds with a number. That number you have to lookup on you card and respond back with the answer.<p>The problems is that some evil hackers has sit on the same time and just made the user think they were login in successful, but the hacker used their in info to login to the bank. The hacker now gets the question for the keycode, but do not have it. The hacker now ask the user who thinks that he has logged in successful, and then give the hacker the CORRECT keycode the hacker need, SUCCESS hack for the evil hacker.<p>All he has to do is to send a lot of spam and get people to fake websites who look like real websites and the hacker wins. The user do not think it is a problem because: ""i have a keycard, nobody can hack me"". That is a BIG problem.<p>I have thougt of a solution:<p>You could make the machine count secounds, because the hacker has to use the double time that it would normally takes to talk with the real server. That way you could tell the user, when the maybe have been comprimised, but what if the user has a slow internet connection.<p>You can not just say, make a program instead of using the browser, because a lot of time the user who is abused has already been infected by malware and spyware.<p>It does not help using SMS as a 2-factor because the hacker can still sit in the middle and log in for the user and the user will get the right SMS and send the code to the hacker.<p>How can we either educated our users to look for certain things like actually respond time or make a solution which do not make it possible for a hacker to do such an attack?<p>I ask this because several people in denmark have been hacked this way after what the Danish goverment promised to be unbreakable. Everything can be hacked in some ways, but the problem is the users thinks the can't and therefore act more stupid and freely, than before when people were told they would die if the told anybody.<p>Best regards from Denmark

4108846,comment,4108400,4108400,8,0,drostie,,,"""Its been very interesting beginning my trajectory in web development in 2012... [PHP] might be the best language to use in gaining an understanding of the fundamentals of web development... No web development language outside of PHP grants you the kind of flexibility to both (a) produce genuine functionality from scratch, outside of an MVC framework, and also to (b) work within the bounds of MVC in deeply sophisticated ways if you wish.""<p>I believe you have overstated your case, perhaps due to inexperience with other languages. In particular, claiming that any modern scripting language is inflexible sounds a bit crazy.<p>I have attempted explaining how to get a WAMP stack running, with EasyPHP, to an absolutely new-to-web-dev indiviual who was curious about creating a chat room. Let me just say that the situation is ten times better now than when I was the same age and was poring, lost, over Bruce Eckel's <i>Thinking In Java</i> trying to do the same thing, which must have been sometime around 1999/2000.<p>These efforts to teach a newcomer reminded me that there's a lot I take for granted. There <i>is</i> a step where you are saying ""okay, we've got to see where Apache is; what port is it listening on, how can we get you to phpMyAdmin; here's how you set up rows and columns in your tables and think about a database; no the reason it's not working is because you saved as '.html' and not '.php'; I know you've seen URLs that don't end in '.php' but that requires invoking the Rewrite Engine and teaching you about .htaccess files; oh the header modifications can't be the first thing you emit; here's the docs, you basically have to search them because there is no organizing principle and no way to find out what you can do...""<p>I agree, Python+Django will make you learn a bunch of weird ""modeling"" stuff first. To me, setting up the data model at the beginning of an app is like inputting a character name at the beginning of an RPG: as some sources testify [1], you can easily waste several hours on purely aesthetic concerns before you even really start to play.<p>Nonetheless, Python+Django comes with a lightweight dev server and an interactive console and a routing table, as well as a template language. The knowledge of the database is internalized to the language, so that I don't have to teach someone how to use phpMyAdmin but rather when to use a ForeignKey. If we talk purely about <i>learning to develop on the Web</i> then PHP has much, much more useless overhead.<p>Sure, eventually we will have to get a production-ready web server communicating with the application, but that can be abstracted until later with Django: it occurs as an up-front teaching cost with PHP.<p>I say this not even as a Python aficionado per se. If anything I like Node, and Node is nowhere near either of them in offering pleasant functionality.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20030630"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20030630</a>",1339627150

Good sales people do a few things to mitigate this that I've noticed and practiced. One thing is to think of it as a game to expect a certain amount of rejection as part of what you do in advance.<p>I mean if I told you right now to pick up the phone and call someone and pitch them and there was no outcome and I paid you $20 to do it you probably wouldn't have a fear of doing that. If I told you that I would pay you if they hang up on you $20 but $0 if they don't you probably would all the sudden not be afraid of the hangup, right? It's all a psychological game. Same thing with approaching a girl in a bar.<p>Second thing though is that some good sales people don't pick up on social cues as well as others. So they don't feel the rejection as much as sensitive people do. If you are cold calling the same micro expressions that might turn a sensitive person into jelly completely escapes many good salespeople. Same with just a voice. It takes time to get over this automatic reaction but it can be done with practice just like anything else.

546485,comment,546005,546408,0,0,sho,,,"Numbers? What numbers would you like to see? I'm talking from first principles here, like Singer. He's saying it's unethical to not help the poor, I'm saying it is often counterproductive to do so in a naive manner. No numbers are necessary to debate this point.<p>And sure, a country with no food production capacity is addicted to foreign food aid exactly like Heroin.<p>Look, I'm trying to argue from first principles here, not get into a number-slinging exercise. I'm trying to counter Singer's broad strokes with some broad strokes of my own - kind of ""concept V. concept"". I can get nuanced if you like.<p>For example, you ask what percentage of the African continental GDP comes from foreign aid? Well, the answer is ""not much"". But take out the ""rich"" countries and it multiplies rapidly. Remove the oil revenue, mostly kept by the elite, and it goes up even further. I don't want to commit too much but I would estimate that in the real, nominal GDP of aid-receiving african areas (just the people, not the oil industry nearby) foreign aid is above 30%. That is a hugely distorting figure, and it is very conservative btw.<p>What percentage of Africa is fed by free food? That's the wrong question. The right question is about food dependency in a single area over time vs an area that didn't receive food aid, and I don't have any numbers for that.<p>I didn't say aid is the primary cause. It's an attempted solution, although it then goes on to cause a whole range of secondary failures. The primary cause would be governance, but that's not what Singer talks about.<p>That link does have some interesting discussion, and I'm also a fan of Overcoming Bias.",1238867739

So, if you're asking, my suggestion is keep your day job and stay a programmer -- at least for a while.<p>Filmmaking is a lot of fun and it's a hobby of mine as well.  With digital cameras you're infinitely liberated.  It's dirt cheap: you just need a good boom mic and your good-to-go, for the most part (especially if you go Dogma 95).  So shoot.  I mean it.  Just go shoot.  You'll most likely have to wear most of the hats: producer/screenwriter/director/editor/sound/etc. But that's great training.  You'll see what you enjoy most.<p>And each time you shoot something, throw it up anywhere you can: YouTube, etc.  If you're good, people will notice.  Robert Rodriguez shot a short 16mm called 'Bedhead' for a local competition, and that took him to film school.  After school he shot El Mariachi for $7,000, and went on from there.  If you're talented, it will show.  To get talented, watch great films with the sound off and shoot, shoot, shoot.",1238867097

546458,comment,546364,546447,0,0,mdasen,,,"In a country like Japan, it's decently easy for a company to run its own backbone and provide connectivity to, say, 80% of where a customer is going to be connecting to with minimal investment.  In the United States, you don't really have that option.  Bandwidth is going to be expensive here.  If you up people to 160Mbps service, you're going to need a ton more backend capacity and because you can't just create that capacity yourself, it's prohibitively expensive.<p>Sure, lack of competition is a problem, but that's just an easy scapegoat.  I mean, bandwidth at 10 cents per GB is <i>really cheap</i> bandwidth - cheaper than you'd get with most dedicated hosts.  Part of what makes that expensive is that fiber has to go a long way to provide that bandwidth - if I'm downloading from NY to San Fran, that's a huge expanse to cover.<p>In Japan, it would be a lot easier for companies providing bandwidth to consumers to also run their own backbone.<p>Sure, competition is a problem in the US, but we're talking about having to do 20x as much cap-ex to cover the US.  Anytime you have 20x greater costs, you need to expect that the product will reflect that.  Saying that it's just competition is an easy way to be anti-corporate without addressing the issue - it costs a lot more to create and run the internet in the US; it doesn't cost a little bit more or 50% more, but orders of magnitude more because we're more spread out.  We don't need to overcome a cost premium of 20%, but probably in excess of 1000% - and it's somewhat incredible that we aren't doing worse.",1238866017

546442,comment,546364,546364,0,0,mdasen,,,"Unfortunately, the article completely ignores the geographic realities or the United States and Japan.<p>First, Japan's population density is orders of magnitude greater than that of the United States.  It's going to cost less to deliver high-speed internet when people live closer together.  Likewise, Japan is a smaller country.  That 160Mbps is not the speed you're going to get traveling over underseas cables to North America.  That's the speed you'll get for servers located within Japan.<p>Backbone connections are going to cost more to create in the United States simply because Americans are as likely to access a server across the continent as they are within 100 miles of them.  Where you can essentially create a backbone in Japan with a under 1,000mi of fiber, in the US you'd need 20x that amount or more.<p>Those are stark differences.  I mean, it wouldn't be too hard for an ISP to provide faster connectivity from Boston to Philly where populations are dense for sites hosted in that area, but that wouldn't be helpful to users - since most of the time I'm not connecting to servers hosted within eastern Mass, RI, CT, the NYC metro area or Jersey.  In fact, I'd say that most of the time I'm connecting to Texas or California.<p>Can we stop comparing Apples and Oranges?  The US can never have broadband like Japan and it's not because of corporations or government or any sort of conspiracy.  Maybe those things could offer <i>marginal</i> improvements (seeing our service go from 6Mbps to 10-15Mbps), but we simply won't have service like Japan will since we don't locate ourselves close to the servers we want to access or to each other.",1238864619

When you click or touch something, something should happen right now, even if more will happen later.<p>Interestingly, Apple are really pushing this now. They&#x27;ve just demonstrated new predictive tech to get response time down to ~ 30 ms from ~ 60 ms on iOS devices (if I remember correctly, this is based on a publicly available WWDC talk).<p>That said, 30 ms is still far too much. Microsoft made a good demo showing just how noticeable 30 ms of lag is compared to none at all (linked on this page by sosuke). But it really just goes to show how poor this current generation of capacitive touch-based devices is. And Apple&#x27;s software-based approach, though it helps, is not sufficient without new hardware too...",1436309974

9848652,comment,9845122,9845445,0,0,darkmighty,,,"Very good point, but the problem of this approach is not that it doesn&#x27;t work, that things are not possible. It&#x27;s The conditions under which it is possible, and the undesirable effects.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s a naïve approach.<p>For example, take the Digital copyright problem in the music industry. Almost anyone would agree musicians should get paid; so legislators feel they have to &#x27;solve it&#x27;. And indeed legislators <i>can</i>  &#x27;solve it&#x27; using just that naive approach: make it illegal, put a huge fine to it. So when you download a music, you will consider the risk of getting caught. The issue then is obvious: if you only legislate, the chance of getting caught will be very low, so most people won&#x27;t care. But if you set the fine/punishment high enough, it&#x27;s pretty much a given people will start being careful. But how much is enough? If you have a 1 in a million chance of getting caught this has to be astronomically large: if people simply thought about expected value (we don&#x27;t exactly, just to illustrate), you&#x27;d need to charge millions per infringement. It&#x27;s a totally unreasonable punishment, basically a terrible system. This is (an example of)  <i>why</i> symptomatic legislation/treatment often doesn&#x27;t work: it&#x27;s grossly ineffective/inefficient, it&#x27;s usually best (but way more complex/demanding) to address the root causes.<p>So the best solution to terrorism/criminal activity is obviously not a surveillance state, but <i>unfortunately</i> it works to an extent. I feel legislators don&#x27;t have at their disposal enough tools to handle the complexity of better solutions. It would be good if we could involve academia/industry way sooner in direct collaboration with legislators, reaching effective solutions -- I feel science is indispensable in finding them for most complex cases.",1436309605

I&#x27;m not talking about ordering and grouping, but truly complex business logic. I have seen tremendous benefits over the years in following this pattern where applicable.<p>To name a few:<p>[0] Application code is much easier to test. This is by far the biggest factor. I recently rewrote a legacy application that was mostly driven by stored procedures hundreds of lines long, to a service driven application with database interaction limited to lookups and saves. We were able to wrap hundreds of automated tests around that process. The confidence we gained and freedom to improve upon it down the road was unbelievable.<p>[1] High level application code is much easier to read and understand than really complex SQL; and therefore is much easier to support. This is extremely important when you have a large team of developers. Of course, bad code is bad code, whether it&#x27;s in the application or database, however I find this rule is still generally true.<p>[2] Depending on your database vendor, the application layer is usually much cheaper to scale horizontally. In the enterprise, I&#x27;ve worked mostly with SQL Server and there is no comparison in the licensing cost involved in standing up a new database server vs an application server.<p>Of course, this is not always the case but from my experience this approach has made the most sense.",1436309529

This is one of the primary concerns in a garage environment.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m not a complete idiot here.

Of course all of those things were done in &#x27;real labs&#x27;, but the last two were done under budgetary pressure where there was a strong emphasis on getting things done cheaply (UMD is not very well-funded, J. Craig Venter Institute was making a painful transition from hard money to soft money).  A lot of those lessons I learned under budgetary pressure translate to doing things in the garage, except, more extreme.<p>I think the primary obstacle to people doing garage biology is not that the biology is hard, but that there are generally two classes of operators, those who have little biology experience, and those who have worked under coddled environments.  The real trick is to find things that are maybe a little hard, but not insurmountably so, but with one or two difficult pain points.  And which are also interesting.  The first class of operator is not generally capable of identifying those qualities, the second class of operator is out of the habit of identifying those qualities.<p>Biology really does mostly work, you&#x27;re just looking at a <i>biased system</i> where people are just throwing money at problems and also looking for reasons to justify continuing to throw money at them (so they have to do hard things).  That also creates silly folkways like the &#x27;biology is hard&#x27; trope which makes the operators miss obvious things because it&#x27;s just easier to say &#x27;biology is hard&#x27; than to think about the problem and figure out how to solve it cheaply and effectively.",1436308260

9848504,comment,9845820,9848061,0,0,Denzel,,,"This type of simple I/O bound pass-through problem lends itself extremely well to evented I/O. Conceptually, their first solution was closest to mimicking the benefits of evented I/O, given how Go&#x27;s runtime works. When a goroutine submits a blocking I/O request, it will yield to another goroutine and wake up later when it can work with the data. So what happened with their first solution?<p>Well, Go&#x27;s runtime allocates 8KB (last I recall) of growable stack space per goroutine. Assuming that their first solution was deployed on the same instance type as their final solution: c4.large (3.75 GB), then they could handle at most ~470,000 outstanding gorountines; assuming that all RAM is used for only gorountines, which is not realistic of course. So their server fell over once it exhausted memory.<p>This type of memory exhaustion isn&#x27;t a problem with evented I/O. You have a single thread that responds to async events related to the I/O you&#x27;re performing.<p>So, due to the limitations of Go&#x27;s runtime, they settled upon a worker-pool that allows at most MAX_WORKERS outstanding requests to S3. Not the most efficient solution for this problem. But it works for their use case, for now, and that&#x27;s what truly matters.",1436307787

Once upon a time there was a great crossroad in the early 90&#x27;s (when I was a kid and learning programming - keep in mind that perspective).<p>BASIC was on its way out - we all knew it to some extent due to home computers renaissance, but it was evident it didn&#x27;t have any staying power. So there were all these wonderful machines with different architectures, OS&#x27; and programming languages out there, with no clear winner (it depended on what you wanted to do). So, basically there were two camps in the end, regarding programming languages. Pascal and C. Pascal had that notion that it was, too, on its way out, but was really useful and Oberon was around the corner so it was worth the wait to stick with it. On the other hand C++ was entering the arena full force, because machines were getting faster (it had a stigma of being slow). I went with C, because I was getting into SGI/IRIX and CG (and later on abandoned programming as a full time choice), and some of my friends went with Pascal. Oberon was floating in the air for some years, but nothing happened. This was always a mystery to me. Eventually, Pascal guys moved to Delphi and my circle of C guys either stayed with C (like I did) or bought OO Kool-Aid and went with C++ (of which some later on went to Java). Pascal (later on Delphi) guys developed sort of a cult. It never was clear what happened to Oberon, and (to me) to this day it&#x27;s a mystery. Funny enough, I can now retrospectively see that programming languages we chose (and stuck with) was heavily influenced by machines/OS&#x27; we used. Pascal guys were mostly PC or Atari guys, and C were mostly those with access to *NIX and Amigas.",1436307540

From the moment we are born, we learn from other peoples actions.  Everything that you understand has either been taught to you, or is a conclusion you’ve developed.\nI will use illustrations and examples through-out this publication to help you understand the facts, and concepts we are discussing.  The prince that was switched at birth was one, here is another.\nHave you ever smelled coffee brewing?  How did you know you were smelling coffee?  The only way you could have known how coffee smells, is someone presented you coffee and you smelled it. You then drew your own conclusion of what coffee smells like.\nHave you ever visited a coffee plantation, or a coffee processing plant?  Coffee has several different smells.  It smells one way growing, another while it is being processed, and yet another when it is being brewed to drink.  So, you probably have only been exposed to one of the smells of coffee. \nIf you ask a person if they know what coffee smells like, they will most likely say yes. The fact is, they probably only recognize aroma of coffee,   The actual fragrance of the coffee will vary greatly depending on whom you ask.  If you ask the farmer, the worker at the coffee plant, or the consumer, all of them may have a different conclusion of what coffee smells like.  They are all correct in their conclusion of what coffee smells like, even though all of their conclusions are different. \n This is the concept that we will build the free human society upon. We can all be right even though we have varying opinions of what right is.  As long as I respect your right to freedom and a peaceful life, and you do the same, we have just solved the problems of human violence.  All that we have to do is convince everyone to agree to the same set of general standards for society, and then enjoy their lives. \nWe can create a society in which everyone has the opportunity to have a free and peaceful life no matter where they were born.  Your children and grandchildren deserve this. Your grandchildren’s children and beyond haven’t done anything to deserve the society that we are poised to leave them.  I will explain how these things are possible, please, just keep reading.\nNot every child can be born of royalty, but that doesn’t mean great things can’t be expected from every child.  In The Free Human Society, every child will be born with a plan for guaranteed success.  This will be discussed later as a main topic  in this publication.\nEvery living person deserves the opportunity for peace, and personal success.  The Universal Constitution will guarantee equal freedom for everyone.  Everyone will have the best medical care, education, and business career opportunities available to society.  All of the Free Human Society will agree to live a life of honesty, and with-out violence.  We will then create a society in which it is very easy to find peace and prosperity, if you live by some simple rules; don’t lie, don’t steal, don’t cheat. How hard can this be?",1436307428

9848456,comment,9847354,9847589,0,0,kstenerud,,,"Further to the credit rating thing, I&#x27;ll post something I wrote for a friend. Note that you can only do this if you have been issued a social security number.<p>If you&#x27;re planning to stay here more than 2 years I highly recommend building up a credit rating. It&#x27;s a pain in the ass, but so many things in the USA depend on your credit score. It&#x27;s absolutely insane, but that&#x27;s the way they do things here.<p>You can actually build up from scratch, even if you can&#x27;t leverage your home country credit rating for a boost. To start, you can get a secured credit card, which requires a cash deposit. The bigger deposit you make, the bigger your credit limit. Your current credit limit is something banks look at when you apply for a real credit card, so it&#x27;s best to get the secured card as high as you can and then a year later get a normal card (or just keep it small for a year, then get it increased by putting more money in, wait a month, and then apply).<p>Once you have enough credit on credit cards (5-10k), you can start getting other kinds of loans. Diversity in loan types is looked upon favorably. I used this trick in Canada to build my rating up there, basically taking a car loan and then putting the cash I would have paid into a term investment that yields a higher interest rate than I&#x27;m paying for the loan. I was going to do that in the USA as well, but they only give loans for cars that are less than 15 years old :(<p>When you first start out, you&#x27;ll need to build up a history of about 2 months with your bank of having used your card AND paid your card. Once that&#x27;s done, they&#x27;ll have reported your activities to various credit reporting companies like equifax and transunion. Next, you can write to these credit reporting companies to request your free credit report. They&#x27;ll send back a request that you prove your identity, asking for copies of various identifications, which is a bit of a pain, but you only need to do that once.<p>You should also make sure that your SSN is clean. When I first came here, I couldn&#x27;t get a card, and I just assumed that it was because I&#x27;m a foreigner. It turns out that in 1994, someone had opened a credit account using a fake SSN. When I arrived here in 2011, I was assigned that compromised SSN, and it took me 2 years to clean everything up. My record is now clean, but I never would have known if I hadn&#x27;t inquired about it with the credit reporting agencies and the bank. I could have had another 2 years of credit history by now if not for that.<p>Here is what affects your credit rating:<p>Credit card utilization (high impact): Keep it below 30%, but always above 0 (having zero credit utilization is bad). Just don&#x27;t carry a balance. I always make sure I spend at least $10 each month with the card so that it never goes to 0. Also, when I had low credit, I would make a purchase, and then immediately go online and pay off all but about $10 of it.\nOne thing to note: This factor is only affected by the previous month, so it&#x27;s easy to fix.<p>Payment history (high impact): ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS pay your card on time! I set up an automatic payment system with my bank.<p>Derogatory marks (high impact): Only affects you if a company sends a collection agency after you and you don’t pay up immediately when they call. Derogatory marks fall off after 7 years.<p>Age of credit history (medium impact): You&#x27;ll get hit hard with this, as I am being hit now. You need 9 YEARS of history to get an excellent rating here, and 2 years just go go from &quot;very poor&quot; to &quot;poor&quot;.<p>Total accounts (low impact): This one is just stupid. Basically, you need to have 6 credit cards just to go from &quot;very poor&quot; to &quot;poor&quot;.<p>Credit inquiries (low impact): You get fucked on this one all the time. Everyone under the sun will do a hard credit inquiry, and they&#x27;ll usually trick you into saying yes without actually telling you they&#x27;re doing it. Others will just do the hard inquiry without even asking you, and even though that&#x27;s illegal, they get away with it. I currently have 14 hard inquiries on my file from phone companies (they did 3!!!), comcast, alarm companies, banks, basically any company that will be billing you monthly. You can have max 2 before it affects your rating much. After 1-2 years the inquiries fall off, so if you&#x27;re doing anything that will likely cause a hit, it&#x27;s best to do them all at the same time (sometimes if they are within a week of each other, they&#x27;ll end up only counting for 1 inquiry in aggregate).<p>Total credit (affects how much more credit you can get): The more credit you have, the more they are willing to give when you ask for it. The higher your overall credit limit, the more favorably companies will see you.<p>You can probably build your rating up to the low 700s within a year as long as you&#x27;re careful. Anything 680 and above is looked upon favorably when trying to rent an apartment. I use a program called &quot;Credit Karma&quot; to help track my credit rating. They also have tips for optimizing your score, but basically it boils down to what I wrote above.<p>Oh, and one last thing: Once you get close to 700, you’ll start getting credit card offers in the mail. Many of them will be “pre-approved”, which is a baldfaced lie. If you reply to them, you’ll actually be giving them permission to do a hard credit inquiry on you, and you could still end up being denied. It’s best to do your research and pick and choose your cards. I always go for cards with no annual fee, even if they have high interest rates (which don’t affect me because I always pay down my cards at the end of the month). Another good thing to look for is point systems. Most of them are 1 point per dollar spent, but some of them have introductory offers where, if you spend a certain amount in the first 3 months, you get a bunch of bonus points. I do this with companies that allow me to trade points for $0.01 each. Last year I waited until I had a bunch of expensive purchases lined up, then got the card, then immediately bought those items. It worked out that after cashing in the points I got 25% of my purchase cost back (spent $2000 to get the bonus 50,000 points, then cashed those in for $500).

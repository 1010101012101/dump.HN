655729,comment,655576,655576,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"I think what's important to remember too is that investment flows like water in the Valley. In places like Texas for example, we're not that lucky so 'startups' (which half likely never make it into CrunchBase), typically turn into very profitable small web-businesses because we don't have the same access to capital to go after the 'long tail'. We're forced to find revenue early, often at the expense of rapid & insane growth that results in big liquidity events. (usually b/c consumer web guys here are bootstrapping or operating on small angel money)",1244861411

The amount of data slurped is incredible -- basically, an RSS feed on your financial life.<p>Your government, in its infinite wisdom, has seen fit to protect you from unscrupulous American companies which could possibly record your data without complying with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.  (Never heard of it?  Your bank has.)  This strengthened existing legislation, such as the Bank Act (never heard of it?

It seems cool but I was originally thinking that the computation of the tasks would happen on the Google App Engine but it appears that it's just the triggering of the execution of the tasks which is not as cool.

It seems to be this is particularly bad form for a number of reasons: not only does it lend itself to overflow issues such as this - it allows competitors to easily gauge twitter's usage.<p>I would of had a generated pseudo random sequence values from the start - it's not like having a simple integer buys you anything in this case.",1244858447

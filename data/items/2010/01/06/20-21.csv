I think you're right that scarcity is a good way to make voting (especially approval-style voting) into something more meaningful.<p>One of the problems with Digg is not just the unlimited amount of voting that one can do, but also the unlimited amount of submitting one can do.  As a result, you have people running scripts to submit tons and tons of articles scraped from RSS feeds.  Literally one article every few seconds.  What your system would do (making people earn mod points through submissions) is simply encourage users to submit as much as possible in order to gain more points.  Crapflooding the queue then destroys the signal to noise ration irretrievably.<p>I think the better way to implement scarcity, apart from your method and Slashdot's method, is to weight users' votes according to the number of votes they've distributed in a given period (say 24 hours).  So a person who votes for under 10 things might have each vote count as a full 1 point.  But a person who votes for 20 things might have their vote count as only 1/2 a point.  You might put a lower bound on it, so that a vote will never be worth less than 1/10th of a point, but you get the idea.<p>It's not scarcity by number, so much as scarcity by dilution.  The best part of this is that it's invisible to the user.  When you have a system that's visible (""You've got 5 Modpoints, Use 'em or Lose 'em!""), you encourage gaming the system.  When you have a system that's invisible, users can behave normally or badly and the system can compensate without giving them clues as to how to game it.",1262810519

But in print I would use justified text more often than ragged-right.  There are reasons that almost all books and newspapers are set justified.",1262810276

Beliefs about what an ideal world would be varies drastically between people and cultures. To avoid the ""colonize the savages / white man's burden"" problem, we need a framework for discussing and evaluating goodness in a more rigorous way, especially one that is viewer independent, cultureless, and timeless. In the 14th century, people lit dogs and cats on fire for amusement. This sort of thing would be greeted with horror by many people today. I wonder what we're doing now that people from the future will view with similar disgust.<p>2. Identify the behaviors / beliefs / etc that prevent such a world from existing now. It seems likely to me that this will involve formulating a scientifically falsifiable model for how people adopt and change beliefs and behaviors. It's not clear how much precision will be attainable for a model this. It could be that we are only ever able to understand very generally which stimuli or environmental conditions will give a higher probability of shifting individuals towards certain behaviors and traits (eg, empowered analytical altruism). We can then identify the levers that cause this shift to occur, eg altering what children are taught at school.<p>In a nutshell:<p>1. [if possible] More rigorously define what good world(s) would look like.<p>2. [if possible] Figure out a model for belief and behavior selection that can be applied to causing / raising people to come to adopt behaviors and beliefs that bring about this better world.",1262809966

Otherwise, return 0 (you could do whatever here, but I just made it simple...).<p>My question is this: do most functional languages do some sort of optimization to avoid basically calling the function twice, since in a purely functional language, functions shouldn't have side affects, so calling a function multiple times with the same input should yield the same output?  In other words, does the runtime/compiler/whatever say ""I just ran function_call(value) and got a result, and since I don't allow side affects, anytime from here on out that I see function_call(value), I'm just going to assume the result is the same.""?<p>Maybe it's because I'm very inexperienced with functional languages, but I find that I run into that kind of situation often enough, and I always think ""Is this going to be really slow because I'm basically calling this function twice even though the result is going to be the same?"".<p>I'm guessing that this may vary language to language; as I understand it, for example, Lisp is ""functional"", but not purely so, and doesn't really enforce the whole ""no side-effects"" thing, so it would have to run the function twice, but I could be mistaken.",1262809414

1035631,comment,1034911,1034911,0,0,grellas,,,"A few observations based on having dealt with countless startups over the years from a legal perspective and otherwise:<p>1.  Officers and directors owe a fiduciary duty to their companies to perform their duties in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. Divulging company confidential information such as finances easily could be construed as a breach of such duties. Thus, in any company having shareholders besides the founders, public disclosure is a step to be taken only with caution. Whatever is happy and upbeat today might be otherwise tomorrow and shareholders may be only too keen to second-guess management if they think some disclosure ultimately left the company vulnerable (e.g., by helping a competitor).<p>2.  You can't ultimately raise money for your company without making disclosure of financial information to prospective investors and a company would, in my view, have potential liability risks from legacy public disclosures that might have been made before the funding itself. What if such disclosures were inaccurate, as they would be if tainted by puffing or by any other depiction of the company's situation that appeared to be accurate on the surface but was in fact misleading. In such a case, what is to prevent an investor from claiming to have relied in a material way on such information to his detriment?<p>There may be other legal risks as well. There certainly are business risks: giving competitors useful information on where to target their resources based on your numbers; giving adversaries in a lawsuit added leverage in their settlement negotiations with your company; giving potential vultures ammunition for when to close in for the kill in an acquisition (e.g., you disclose ""happy numbers"" in a couple of good years and then go silent when you get overextended as a company and become vulnerable).<p>In general, one of the great advantages of being a closely-held company is the privilege of keeping the financial information within a very tight-knit group inside the company. To give that up gratuitously will in most cases be a big mistake. Of course, it may make sense for some founder groups to opt for such disclosure for some of the reasons cited in the post and in this thread.

There are limits to what they'll upvote, unless they genuinely like it.  Whereas it's not ok to email a bunch of people and tell them to create HN accounts for the purpose of upvoting your post; that's basically sockpuppets by proxy.  The threshold is somewhere between these two cases.<p>There is a lot of code for detecting voting rings, and it itself embodies varying levels of punishment (ranging from votes not affecting the position on the page, to votes not affecting the score, to the post getting flagged to be killed) depending on how abusive a vote seems.

1035606,comment,1034911,1035561,0,0,lsc,,,"Hm.  I suppose it depends on who your users are.  None of those things would convince me of your stability.  My thought is that usually, the faster a business expands, the greater chance it has of overstepping itself and failing.  For example, until now, my costs have been such that if I fuck up and loose revenue, I can pay for operating costs by getting a full time contracting gig.  (I've been expanding, and I'm rapidly approaching the point where this is no longer the case.  But there have been many times during the last five years when I have fucked it up and I have needed to rent myself out to pay for it.)<p>In other words, going full time prematurely almost killed my business, several times.  I mean, I'm full-time now, but as far as stability of the business goes, me being full time adds quite a lot of risk.  (It adds upside, too;  I can get a lot more done, but it means that I have less room to pay for mistakes.)<p>Thinking more about this, I think part of the disconnect between what you say and what I think is that I am running a business that is in large part reselling services I rent from others.  (well, I rent power and data center space, and then I buy servers, install software, and rent out a portion of the CPU/RAM/etc...  but by far my biggest cost is power and data center space.  I almost spend that much on hardware every month too, but that is only because I am growing.  over the 3 year lifespan of a server, the power it consumes will exceed it's original purchase price, at least when it comes to what I pay for hardware and what I pay for power. )<p>The difference is in likely failure modes.   If you have a webapp you can run on a single server (an 8 core/32GiB ram server is gonna cost north of $2K to buy, but you can host it for under $150/month, and 32GiB ram/8 cores can handle rather a lot of users.)  you really only go out of business when you get tired of it.  most people can support the $150/month server indefinitely, even if there is not any money coming in.  On the other hand, uh, my hosting costs are large enough that if there was no money coming in, well, I'd need to get a contracting gig fast.  As long as the webapp guy is making plans for next year, there probably will be a next year.   On the other hand, the guy with the high overhead is likely going to relax when things are going well, and is likely to plan hardest when he can see failure.",1262808221

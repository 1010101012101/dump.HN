9401883,comment,9401799,9401842,0,0,hugs,,,"(Author here.) I agree with you, there are several factors at play in what happened to MakerBot. I believe Bre learned the wrong lesson -- going closed might have looked like the obvious solution to their drop in sales. But the one huge advantage MakerBot had over their competitors (and the cloners) was the good will and support from the open source community. With that support gone after going closed, MakerBot had to sink or swim on its own. I think they could have found a way to stay open while dealing with concerns of revealing future plans. For one, they could have kept the plans closed during development, but released all the plans on launch, forcing their competitors to play catch-up. As a user, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need access to future designs for future models, but definitely would want designs to the current model that I owned. But anyway, I now buy LulzBot 3D printers, which are fully open. The latest version is TAZ 5.0. I can&#x27;t tell, though, just by looking at the LulzBot online repo [1] if plans for future versions are also posted there ahead of official release.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://download.lulzbot.com/TAZ/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://download.lulzbot.com/TAZ/</a><p>[Edit] LulzBot is more awesome than I thought.

But is the possibility that one of those companies maybe might someday develop a breakthrough justify the preventable deaths of millions of people right now?<p>And would they really shut down? Any company that produces a truly miraculous cure has to know that government will step in sooner or later. People aren&#x27;t going to sit by while a company hands out the cure for aging to only the super wealthy. Surely a company researching the cure for aging would have taken this possibility into account before starting.<p>Medical breakthroughs aren&#x27;t a linear function of funding.

9401870,comment,9398847,9400427,0,0,ics,,,"> From my perspective, not being able to re-sell that one great photo is exactly the deal you&#x27;re making when hired to do a job.<p>Only as far as the contract says that is so, as at least in the US the implicit agreement is the opposite.[1]<p>Don&#x27;t conflate having a client with being employed (I don&#x27;t think you are, but the second sentence could be read that way). A more realistic understanding of the freelance photographer&#x27;s life is that their bread and butter is almost never just one thing... even successful photographers who demand high fees are constantly looking for new and steadier revenue streams. As time goes on and technology improves, the number of photographers (at least: <i>people able to take pleasing photos</i>) will only increase. Naively this means that the price for services should be driven down, but what it really means is that pros will have to charge more and amateurs will have to do more for less. Photographers in the middle, the ones who do most of the business, will have some tough decisions about how to proceed and many will stick with whatever disadvantages them the least. Giving up your rights in a field where that&#x27;s uncommon is a pretty major disadvantage, especially when today&#x27;s client comes from <i>anywhere</i>. Giving up the rights to display visual work online will make any creator gulp, because that&#x27;s the new portfolio. And, unlike code or patents, people can and do give a quick flick through <i>everything</i> you show in order to make a judgement about whether to hire you.<p>There are plenty of photographers who will do your job for free (a wedding is a bad example here though) and try to make money some other way but they will either be: students, friends with prosumer gear, or people who have another guaranteed income (gallery/publishing contracts perhaps). That last group will be <i>tiny</i> and probably pick what events they do themselves.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for rambling a little bit on the subject because I do agree that there are probably better compromises to be made in the future. I think there&#x27;s a great potential market for photographers especially to market themselves in the way you want them to actually operate, i.e. not as producers of intellectual property but as technicians providing a service. Unfortunately, until it becomes normal it will really be just another way to charge more. What would help is if these sorts of contracts could be developed by interested parties and released free to potentially gain mindshare. Everyone is in a much better position to negotiate a price (&quot;fair wage&quot;, which is obviously dependent on many externals) if the implications of a contract have already been worked out.<p>Summary: You have a good argument, but it&#x27;s just one good argument in a sea of tradition and status quo. There are good arguments on the other side as well I think. When photography becomes more of a &quot;need&quot; and less of a luxury (or maybe when it doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to be done by people) then those compromises may work themselves out anyway. Some ideas for what could be done before then.<p>All in all, it sounds like you found someone good to work with on fair terms and probably both learned something about how photography is valued by the other side. By you as a private memory, by them as rendered services.<p>[1] I actually work mostly in a visual field producing work which I retain full rights to. The client is given a perpetual license to use in any way they see fit which usually means public display and publishing (in monographs or online). Though I am not contractually obliged to, I refrain from publishing any work myself at least until the client has done so themselves. It&#x27;s a courtesy that no doubt would work become part of the contract if I were to stop doing it, but it&#x27;s agreeable even if it requires checking in every so often to ask if <i>the thing</i> is public yet. Clients understand that I (and others who do the same thing) would be at a severe disadvantage if I was prevented from displaying my work for the sake of <i>getting more work</i> even if I can find a way to make marginal profit from it. Sometimes it actually helps both myself and the client to put a tagline of &quot;Commissioned by [Client Name]&quot; (free advertising for them). In short, I&#x27;m sympathetic to the less cutthroat ways of dealing with intellectual property while at the same time being very protective of my legal right to do what I need to do based on my own moral compass I guess.<p>[I&#x27;m just going to apologize again in case you actually read all this. Heh.]",1429412041

We make policy decisions that limit how much money companies can make from medical breakthroughs all the time. The FDA approval process, for instance. If we stopped requiring FDA approval, developing drugs would be much more profitable, but as a society we agree that drug safety is a good trade off.<p>What if drug affordability is a good trade off as well? There&#x27;s no way to know without investigation, but that is why I&#x27;m opposed to making policy on purely ideological grounds. What if it turns out that limiting pharmaceutical profits, decreases medical funding by 10%, but increases access to drugs that are developed by 100%? Again it may work out exactly opposite, but if you oppose limiting the price of drugs just because &quot;it&#x27;s wrong&quot;, you&#x27;ll never know.<p>What if it turns out that medical funding isn&#x27;t the bottleneck in medical breakthroughs. What if the number of people capable of becoming researchers is, and what if that amount goes up with more affordable drug access.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not proposing a specific course of action, but I&#x27;m saying that there are situations where the free market doesn&#x27;t work and regulation is necessary.",1429411866

Of course, they have a high level of corruption, but when you look deeper, you will see, that we in Europe have also much corruption. The main difference: While in many South America countries everybody knows about the corruption, for example in Germany corruption is much much more covered -- but it exists, maybe even in the same degree as in South American countries. It is just covered much more. What makes me worry is, that while the normal police-men in Germany may have integrity, the normal top-politician seems to have none left. I can give no name of a top politician today, where I would assume, that he is not influenced or even bribed by some groups.<p>I think, that this gives a really bad signal to all the people in this nation.

Judges want to be re-elected because they are &quot;tough on crime&quot; (in places where judges are elected)
Prosecutors want to have a successful career so they will do anything they can get away with to get a conviction.
The police want to have the case be off their hands and to be &quot;closed&quot; so that their stats look good because it&#x27;s good for their career because the Mayor wants to be &quot;tough on crime&quot; and so the police find the first plausible suspect and try to build a case.<p>All these organizations are in cahoots, literally, and so no prosecutor is going to indict a judge or cop unless they absolutely have to.<p>So long as the public can be lead to believe they live in a society with the &quot;rule of law&quot; not the &quot;rule of man&quot; then nothing more needs to be done.

Later on PC Magazine or some other company made ANSI.COM that you could load at any time as a Terminate and Stay Resident program to see ANSI codes.<p>It basically uses the CGA 80x25 text 16 color screen on PC and PC clones.<p>I could be wrong, but I think the terminal codes were based on VT-100 or something with the IBM font added. When I had an Amiga 1000 I had to set my terminal to VT-100 and load a font that had the IBM PC character set in it, because the Amiga fonts had different character sets in them that didn&#x27;t look right.<p>Modern terminal programs for BBSes are like this one:

Some of this stuff is literally millennia old - but people are still queuing around the block to see it.<p>If you build something out of atoms, that sucker stays there - not quite forever, but some combinations of atoms can easily outlast many human lifetimes.<p>Compare that with bits, where file formats, storage media, operating systems, and basic hardware all keep changing and content preservation is hit and miss. (I have video files from the late 1990s that are unplayable now.)<p>Code is even more fragile, especially if it&#x27;s heavily OS- or framework-specific.<p>So people like physical stuff. It can survive without power or a reader device. That makes it more reassuring than a transient digital content blip that&#x27;s gone before your kids have had a chance to experience it.",1429408829

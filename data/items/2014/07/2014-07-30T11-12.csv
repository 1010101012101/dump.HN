One feature request: Better calculations for cities with Bi-modal price distributions.<p>Certain cities have a extremely bi-modal distributions of pricing. I.e. they can support both the &quot;broke artist&quot; lifestyle, and the &quot;upper middle class&quot; lifestyle. Two separate cost distributions. If you try to take the mean or median of these cities, you&#x27;ll end up either arbitrarily landing on one of the distributions, or a nonsense number in the middle.<p>A good example is Manhattan. For example, pizza can actually be cheaper in Manhattan than Sofia. In Manhattan, the broke artist lifestyle of living with multiple roommates who barely know each other, all sharing a rent controlled apartment for a few hundred dollars a month is more socially acceptable and much more common. Just taking prices from the realtor-controlled apartment websites is a poor reflection of reality. Almost no one except the richer consultants bothers with a full-time coworking desk in either city. In this case, Manhattan can actually cost less than Sofia.<p>So, I think the &quot;broke artist&quot; price distributions would better reflect what a remote working nomad would be looking for, instead of the &quot;upper middle class&quot; prices.",1406719518

I don’t ever want to be in a situation where I’m afraid of weighing myself, and if I weigh myself every day (or even somewhat less frequently but still with regularity) and keep track of my weight that fear is just not an issue.

8107414,comment,8105395,8106699,1,0,majika,,,"> This kind of censorship has nothing to do with being a nanny state. ... Is China a nanny state? North Korea? Saudi Arabia? Eritrea? What about the continent-spreading empires of the last century that were run by mustachioed gentlemen, were they &#x27;nanny&#x27; states?<p>It is related, because censorship is authoritarian, and nanny-statism is authoritarian. If the government of a democratic society thinks it should tell its people what they can and can&#x27;t say, then it&#x27;s likely that that government (i.e. society) also thinks it should intrude into people&#x27;s lives and protect them from themselves, because personal responsibility is dangerous. This correlation certainly holds for Australia, which is why I mentioned it.<p>Those countries you mentioned - China, Saudi Arabia, etc - aren&#x27;t democratic, so I don&#x27;t think their authoritarianism reflects the societal will. Thus, the authoritarianism doesn&#x27;t transfer to, e.g., the government telling people they can&#x27;t ride a bicycle without a helmet. Authoritarian and democratic countries <i>are</i> nanny-states, almost by definition: e.g., the UK, Australia, Singapore.<p>> RSF still rates the US as being less free than Australia when it comes to the press<p>I love the Reporters Without Borders, but I don&#x27;t think their Press Freedom Index has much merit. Not only is its methodology flawed and subjective, but the calculation of the index is highly opaque, and so I suspect it&#x27;s somewhat politicized.<p>We don&#x27;t know (1) the number of respondents from each country, (2) the kinds of respondents from each country, or (3) the distribution of answers to the questionnaire for each country. Without those things, we can&#x27;t talk empirically about press freedom. As it stands, we can only speculate on what the simplified &quot;index&quot; means.<p>You mentioned the US as a comparison for press freedom: I&#x27;d like to point out that the US is home to a number of organizations that publish very controversial opinions, like Twitter, Reddit, 4chan, Cryptome, The Intercept, etc. I find it very, very difficult to imagine these organizations existing in Australia (or many of the countries at the top of the RSF&#x27;s index) -- don&#x27;t you? I mean, it&#x27;s illegal to publish &quot;racist&quot; opinion here, and the majority of Australian society seems fine with that - any American I mention that to laughs in my face, and rightly so.<p>Furthermore, the US also has a number of excellent (at times) news organizations, like The New York Times, The Washington Post, NBC, and PBS. Sure, these organizations are influenced by the US government, but influence isn&#x27;t quantitative. To say that the ABC, or the Sydney Morning Herald, or Nine are influenced by the Australian government <i>less</i> is mere speculation.<p>All news organizations are influenced by the society to which they serve, and the government to which they report on. You should always try to vary who and where you get your news from, and always be aware of bias.<p>> As for whether it&#x27;s a good thing or not to be a &#x27;nanny&#x27; state, perhaps have a look at the quality of life in the &#x27;nanny&#x27; versus non-&#x27;nanny&#x27; states.<p>As an Australian, I don&#x27;t think banning psychoactive drugs, nor banning &quot;racist&quot; speech, nor mandatory bike helmets, nor bar lockouts at 12pm, nor homeschooling restrictions do anything to improve the quality of life here. In fact, I think those policies harm the quality of life significantly.<p>Australia&#x27;s economic success (and thus &quot;quality of life&quot;) is thanks to its (small-l) liberal economic policies of the 80s and 90s, and the resources boom of the 00s -- not because I can&#x27;t buy a joint at a cafe here.<p>FWIW, if you&#x27;re basing your judgment of &quot;quality of life&quot; on the UN Human Development Index, know that that is another highly simplified and flawed index. I&#x27;ll let you look into that on your own. The HDI certainly isn&#x27;t a ranking of quality of life - but a well-traveled person like yourself would know that, right?",1406718636

In the story the problem is resolved via mass genocide of 99% of the human race. Kornbluth intended it as uncomfortable black satire, to be sure, but that hardly means that the premise can&#x27;t be taken seriously.<p>The story was widely popular in the SF community despite its serious logical flaws (ironic given that community&#x27;s ostensible preference for &quot;hard SF&quot; that rigidly adhered to good science).

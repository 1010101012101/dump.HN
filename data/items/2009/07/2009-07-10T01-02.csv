696980,comment,696639,696967,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Sorry if I come across as playing with definitions. Words matter, and if you have one meaning and I have another, we're just going to talk past each other.<p>A Christian, by definition, is one who follows Christ. The ""Bible"" as I guess you are using the term, is a collection of religious letters put together in the 3rd century out of dozens or hundreds of candidates. Fundamentalists think of the bible as a textbook. So do critics, except they think of it as a flawed textbook. More modern versions of Christianity view that Bible as largely allegorical.<p>You can certainly be a Christian and not believe in the bible. Good grief, you can be a Christian and not believe in God. You could even be an atheist.<p>But these are just simple facts that I would take as a starting point for discussion.<p>The best I can tell, there is a universal core definition of God across religions which is something like ""that which we are not able to understand"". I can grok this, as throughout history there have been things we do not understand. Perhaps God will be by ex-wife: never could figure her out. So if you asked me for a definition, that's the one I'd give. Not some myth-overloaded product of hundreds of years of religious dogma. God is a belief that we do not know everything. At least to me. I find such a belief a critical part of being a mature intellectual.<p>You're welcome to take shots at that definition. I'd like to hear your critique. I don't have any answers. The issue of God and all of the sub-issues has been debated for ages. Perhaps there is some new angle everybody else has missed. Who knows?",1247189984

Sh one the other hand is almost as universal as ed(1), and implements the most sane subset of bash anyway.<p>Other systems (eg., Plan 9) don't have bash available at all (this is considered by some as a <i>feature</i>), while bourne is supported, if only for backwards compatibility.<p>> In my opinion all shells are quite horrible.<p>Most mainstream shells are indeed horrible (don't get me started on csh), but [there are some quite sane shells out there](<a href=""http://rc.cat-v.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rc.cat-v.org</a>).<p>> The idea is to pick the lowest common denominator and bash just happens to be the most popular of the bunch.<p>lowest common denominator != most popular of the bunch.<p>> Your chances of finding a working /bin/bash on any given system are still orders of magnitude higher than finding a working capistrano/fabric along with the corresponding ruby/python toolchain.<p>And your chances of finding a working /bin/sh on any given system are still orders of magnitude higher than finding a working /bin/bash",1247189416

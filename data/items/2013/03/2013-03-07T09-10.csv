It turns out that often you can't effectively encapsulate state in a class such that no one else but the class itself needs to know about that state.<p>As the size of a class grows, mutable member variables approach globals. If you wisely break the class into smaller ones, classes will still contain instances of other classes, so to reason about the behaviour of your class you often have to understand the possible state of its sub-instances.

Yes, it's true that you should have no File IO in a constructor when it violates the SRP. At the same time (and as the author notes), it's very convenient to have Foo.fromFile(String path) or similar.<p>Here's what I think the compromise looks like:<p><pre><code>   public static OptimizedPage fromFile(String path) throws IOException {
      return OptimizedPage.from(path, FileReader.readFile(path));
   }
</code></pre>
Which seems like having your cake and eating it too.<p>Or to put it another way: that File IO needs to happen either way -- forcing the caller do write:<p><pre><code>   OptimizedPage foo = OptimizedPage.from(path, FileReader.readFile(path));

So, i certainly don't feel the same way for emberjs as the writer.<p>I had decided to build the frontend in a js mvc framework and the candidates were backbone, emberjs (pre version), angularjs. Read about them and gave backbone a try, however from the documentation only emberjs approach felt better maybe because of a similar in-house development java framework that we work on. So i tried to give emberjs a try at the same time, due to the tight deadlines. I dropped backbone, and spent more time on emberjs because everything simply worked and fitted together nicely. All these binding mechanisms are great and actually work :) . Haven't tried angularjs.<p>The system now works with emberjs (pre and rc) with a nice layered architecture and separate independent business logic modules.<p>My advice is to read the documentation carefully and choose what fits better to your needs and coding styles.",1362647891

Virtually all collections and objects can be manipulated as one of these two types. So ""calling a method"" on an inappropriate type is basically passing an inappropriate map to a function. You might want to disallow it, but Clojure allows it for good reason: this makes it possible to have many data access/manipulation functions that work on all objects.

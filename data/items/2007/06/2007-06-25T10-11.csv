XP can tremendously improve the quality of the software and moreover helps to spread knowledge of the codebase if the right guys are working together. If you have the wrong guys sitting together they will stall each other on discussions of coding style and for  versus while loop efficiency. You should probably just sit together and see why the guys want to do it. If they have the right arguments and are not merely argumentative about it; you might wanna let them do it their way.

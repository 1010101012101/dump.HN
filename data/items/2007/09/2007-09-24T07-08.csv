It would also future proof the currency against developments that could make oil worthless, though I don't see that happening anytime soon.<p>At least right now, it makes a lot more sense to trade in an energy containing commodity than pure energy because it's easier and more familiar to people.",1190619959

That's about on the same level as PB and his read heads.  The level of detail in this article goes well beyond that and is unnecessary.",1190619913
58788,comment,58705,58705,0,0,cperciva,,,"Wow, I must be incredibly smart.  I hate OOP (if you want function pointers, just use function pointers, and forget all this modern ""object oriented"" garbage); dislike databases (for the same reason as mentioned in the article -- they're leaky abstractions where performance is concerned); scowl every time someone mentions ""web services"" (tunneling RPC over HTTP?  I was doing that long before ""web services"", REST, or SOAP existed, and it has nothing to do with the web); hate synchronous networking (for performance reasons, of course) and avoid it even in places where it would be quite adequate; rigidly stick to BSD style(9); and also (a hangup not mentioned in the article) absolutely loathe garbage collection (I'm smarter than the garbage collector).<p>The fact is, however, that having hangups doesn't mean that you're smarter than anyone else.  Rather, it simply means that you're willing to refuse jobs which don't meet your (arbitrary) requirements.  People who are smart are more able to be picky, because they have more jobs available to them; but people who are independently wealthy can turn down jobs due to personal hangups; and anyone who is employed in a field other than programming can afford to have as many programming-related hangups as they want.<p>If you have to support a wife and children, and programming is your only marketable talent, you're not going to have programming-related hangups for long.",1190618993

The real problem is that 'millions of years' period. Anybody can make up a nice theory involving 'millions of years'. But how do you prove it? You can't. That's the real question and real problem with the evolution theory. It's only a theory which nobody can prove. (But a time machine would certainly help :)",1190618354
58784,comment,58780,58780,0,0,cperciva,,,"Remember: The fact that you CAN us a regular expression doesn't mean that you SHOULD.  I'm sure this isn't the slowest possible way to detect primes, but I honestly can't think of a slower way right now.  [EDIT: Ok, I can now see how to detect primes in superexponential time by simulating a Turing machine.]<p>In general, the more powerful a tool is, the slower it is.  Good coding requires understanding how much power you need and using the right tool -- not waving a sledgehammer around because you've discovered that it can solve all of your problems.",1190618167

58782,comment,58641,58641,0,0,jyoon,,,"While I agree with some of the points in the article, I want to stress that this is only one possible scenario. (Sorry for this long post. It's my first.)<p>A couple of times, the article mentions a country's wealth and power.  In the long run, national competitiveness determines a nation's wealth. Currency changes are a mechanism that can influence competitiveness in the short term.  (As mentioned by others, devaluation can increase competitiveness and wealth.)  National competitiveness has been studied exhaustively. While there are still a lot of questions, we seem to agree that a nation needs to produce goods/services that the rest of the human race values and are willing to pay for at an efficient cost.  The nation also needs to attact the most able and willing workers, call them the ""talent"".  The nation needs a mechanism to identify and provide opportunities to the talent.  Thus far, U.S. is recognized as the nation still most able to provide these conditions.  Less universally agreed upon is the need for a rule of law including rights to personal property, the opportunity for the talent to accumulate much more property than the average person, and efficient access to capital.  As those on this website know, access to capital and entrepreneurial support is pretty good here :)<p>There are two additional trends that I think have influenced the Asian Currency Crisis.  One is the broad aging of the population in the wealthy contries.  There is a net savings effect that is still going on.  Younger people have more need of loans and older people have more need to invest.  Right now, the need to invest outweights the need for loans.  Money has been cheap for several decades.  No one know what effect this will have when an equilibrium is reached, sometime in 2030.  Another effect is land.  The U.S. is said to have about the same livable land as China.  You can see what this might mean.  China has about 1.5 billion people to U.S.'s 300 million.  A lot of Chinese will want to immigrate to US to get away from extreme over-crowding and the destroyed environment.  (If you get the chance, watch the documentary ""Manufactured Landscapes."") This will cause land values in US to rise, in proportion to the rise in China's per capita income.<p>National economies have changed drastically over a relative short time period -- a few decades.  One of the scenarios discussed by experts is similar to the doomsday scenarios caused by a US dollar devalution versus the Chinese yuan. In most estimates, if this particular scenario does occur, it takes about 30-50 years.  Interestingly, if you listen to most Chinese government and financial representatives, they present a doomsday scenario where China is the one going bust.  They are very familiar with their own potential dangers, while we are much more aware of our own problems.  For example, China has a very serious pension issue.  Due to the one child policy, their workers-to-retired ratio is far smaller than in the U.S.  They have not begun to create a Social Security program.  (Think of Logan's Run.  Actually, there are scary stories that I've heard from some of my Chinese friends.)  I'm just giving another angle to this whole national competitiveness issue. ",1190618154
58781,comment,58750,58778,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"The nice thing about raytracing is that it scales so well with parallel processing. The more pipelines, the more simultaneous rays you can process at one time. Synchronization issues are minimal because essentially what you are doing is waiting for pixel data to return from all of the rays shot from the camera. Order doesnt really matter. Sounds like a perfect problem for multi-pipelined GPGPU programming.<p>Hadn't heard of Neoptica before, but they do look like they have some really smart people there. Raytracing itself is an old concept, but I'm sure there are creative ways to optimize and extend the concept yet to be done.<p>Here is some info on what Neoptica is doing. Sounds very impressive [PDF]: <a href=""http://www.neoptica.com/NeopticaWhitepaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neoptica.com/NeopticaWhitepaper.pdf</a>",1190617478

Take it to Apple Genius who may well just fix it for free (definitely if it&#x27;s under warranty and quite often if it isn&#x27;t) or tell you exactly what&#x27;s wrong and how to fix it yourself or where to get it fixed cheaply.<p>Assuming your problem isn&#x27;t already solved, then Apple products are no easier than rival brands aside from being better built in the first place, having standardized parts, a simple range of models, and an active third party market.<p>I&#x27;m sure Microsoft has different levels of support, but I suspect everyone you&#x27;re talking to is referring to Apple&#x27;s standard warranty coverage. I&#x27;d rather have an Apple product with standard coverage than anyone else&#x27;s product with &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;platinum&quot; or whatever they call it support.

10429657,comment,10425182,10428029,0,0,6stringmerc,,,"As eropple covered quite well, native Windows latency isn&#x27;t up to industry standards. ASIO4ALL has been very good to me on the desktop OS, but I believe that is very RAM dependent - I&#x27;ve never run it on less than an i5 with 8GB of RAM, whether XP, Win7 or Win10. Because it&#x27;s free and community supported, I consider it simply an oversight by MS.<p>Unfortunately I can&#x27;t speak to Windows phones or tablets, because I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ve used iOS for that. There&#x27;s simply too many good, well, excellent audio programs in that sector to try otherwise. My main ones are Propellerhead Figure, GarageBand, a few synths in production, and djay2 for fun playing tunes and mixing.<p>The issue that Windows can address with the tablets (not sure about phones) is the ability to plug in a USB soundcard. This is an extremely helpful ability that iOS really doesn&#x27;t support (again, the native CoreAudio deserves recognition as very good). I got a very small M-Audio (now owned by Avid) soundcard that runs ASIO drivers, has a mic in and phones out (both stereo), and I even got an Asus Netbook with 2GB of RAM to run Ableton Live 8 well enough to create loop-based tracks on the go! For live performance, people simply love the MacBook Pro platform because of stability, and I can understand. The more that Microsoft does though, the more attention that will be granted from software developers to try and capitalize on the potential market. If MS continues to keep their hardware/software combination friendly to more tech savvy type musicians, e.g. plugging in a soundcard and running desktop type software on portable hardware, then I think they&#x27;ll be able to take some market share.<p>I do have access to a Surface Pro 3, but because I&#x27;m happy and still working on my Lenovo ultrabook with Win10 (keeping my prior Win7 one as a &#x27;desktop&#x27;), I&#x27;m not really anxious to go messing with that. But, for DJ type folks who use &#x27;controllers&#x27; like the stuff made by Pioneer, a Surface Pro plus a controller with built-in audio is a compelling offering.

The startup where I work makes extensive use of this project to speed up our Python.<p>The basic infrastructure was in place after ~2 months.  Since then, our team has been using it extensively, and I&#x27;ve been filling out the functionality & evolving the API (for example, testing different array iteration & access interfaces, to see what feels awkward vs convenient, balancing the trade-off between Nim-ness vs Numpy-ness vs Pythonic-ness, etc.).<p>You write your Nim procs, then annotate them with a special annotation (that&#x27;s valid Nim, but inert most of the time).  When you want to auto-generate Python wrappers around your Nim procs, there&#x27;s a Python script you run that creates & compiles Python C-API code that exposes the Nim procs in Python as a shared library.  This auto-generated code also translates Nim exceptions (including back-traces) to Python exceptions, calls the Nim GC before you return to Python runtime, etc.  The auto-generated code also includes auto-generated Python docstrings, extracted from the Nim procs.<p>There&#x27;s a Nim type that provides a nice Nim interface to Numpy arrays, so you can pass Numpy arrays into your Nim procs and access them natively.  We&#x27;ve also recently added support for a few cute features, like the tuple return types & default parameter values. :)<p>The API is not yet solidified, so I&#x27;d call the project &quot;alpha&quot; or &quot;beta&quot;, but it definitely works!  The intention is to open-source it soon (once we&#x27;re happy with the API).<p>Would you be interested in using something like this?  What features would you need?

If the inter-exchange spread is wide, there is some value to be extracted from compressing that spread, and HFT provides the (in my opinion) valuable service of extracting that value, making the market more efficient as a whole.<p>The more people that are competing in that market, the smaller the value the HFTs can extract, until the actual market participants on the exchanges are only paying fractions of a penny for the privilege of buying shares &quot;originating&quot; from another market that has higher liquidity.

10429495,comment,10428186,10428186,0,0,technotony,,,"I lived in two campus houses for a period over a year. The vision and concept were great, and it&#x27;s failure should 100% not be read as a failure of the sector. Someone&#x27;s going to do this right and make a big success. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll reinvent whole cities, Tom&#x27;s full vision, but they&#x27;ll make better places for people to live.<p>My personal view of why it fails (as a housemate not an insider to the business) was the following:\n1. Too much money too early meant they spent more than they should on things which weren&#x27;t necessarily valued. Examples being hot-tubs in all the early houses, the vacation houses (I get they were an experiment) etc.\n2. Poor financial management. Property at it&#x27;s core is a simple business and getting the accounting/billing right is vital. I suspect that the leadership team didn&#x27;t have enough financial knowledge of the books to run such a business, needed a grey hair CFO much earlier.\n3. Premature scaling. I assume pressure from investors and the economics models showed you had to get mega scale to get VC rewards, and this lead to pressure to grow too fast. I moved from one house to another and it was clear there was a difference in how carefully the inhabitants were selected and this weakened the value proposition (the second house had two separate groups with very different and competing goals from living together).<p>I really hope someone gets this right, and not just for 20 something year olds. When I get married and have kids I&#x27;d love to have 5-10 other families sharing common areas, responsibilities etc. Figuring out how to build that community element and make it scalable is the hard part.",1445469372

As I understand, there are &quot;only&quot; two problems - Apple not allowing other HTML/JS implementations, and Apple not allowing writable, executable memory. I don&#x27;t know what the status of the first is, but you can get around the latter by just using an interpreter instead of a JIT (which is of course terribly slow).<p>Or, you decide Apple is never going to let your engine on the App store, and then you just include the JIT. The enforcement is done at time of submission to the app store, not at runtime. IIRC, you can just call a certain function to mark a memory region as writable or executable, but Apple detects this call statically.<p>I further wonder if you could just distribute binaries, outside of the app store, and your users would have $99 developer accounts, and run a little script to &quot;build their project with XCode&quot;, signing and installing it to their device?",1445468566

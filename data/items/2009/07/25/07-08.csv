(Not meant to rant; serious question -- we wrote silly C compilers for class; seems like programmers with real talent should be able to write real, industry strength C compilers, especially if it only needs to support C, and not C++/Java/ObjC/...)",1248508022

723086,comment,721577,721630,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I guess one problem is that expecations of users of OSS are not just a thing between the developer of a particular piece of software and its users. The open source movement has been busy creating expectations of OSS being better supported, higher quality software with a commercial business model.<p>All the big corporations supporting open source by making code available also change the perception that open source is some kind of grass roots non-commercial thing. The single developer of some open source library may in fact be on the payroll of some BigCorp playing some kind of advocacy role for which he is being paid a salary.<p>You don't know unless you dig deeper and some people don't dig deeper. They just work on the basis of general assumptions formed by the collective advocacy effort of the open source movement as a whole.<p>Of course that doesn't mean an individual developer has to honor that collective promise. I do understand that guy's rant. I'm just trying to explain how such misguided expectations can arise.<p>The conclusion, for me, is this: Don't use open source software unless you don't need it and could build it yourself, unless you know why the developer has a vested interest in making you, the user, happy.",1248507224

If I buy something, I know that the vendor is interested in making me happy to some (sometimes minor) degree. If I pick up code that someone dropped on github I cannot make that assumption.<p>So the two models default to different basic assumptions and that has nothing to do with support contracts being available or not.",1248505655

723070,comment,722517,722517,0,0,justin_vanw,,,">The first thing that happens, for example, when a law is passed that no one shall be paid less than $106 for a forty-hour week is that no one who is not worth $106 a week to an employer will be employed at all. You cannot make a man worth a given amount by making it illegal for anyone to offer him anything less. You merely deprive him of the right to earn the amount that his abilities and situation would permit him to earn, while you deprive the community even of the moderate services that he is capable of rendering.<p>Ok, I can't let logic like that slide by.  I'll just list off why it is totally junk reasoning:<p>- Assumes that worker is getting 'what he is worth to an employer' currently.  This would assume that the worker and the employer are on an equal footing, both in power (workers can be coerced and intimidated into lower wages), and intellect (workers can be tricked and bamboozled), and in information (workers know less about the going rates for labor than an employer, if only because employers have lots of employees, but an employee has only one employer usually).  \n- Assumes the worker is optimally employed to maximize earnings.  Lots of people work in fields because they fell into that sort of work, and learning a new language or new skills is hard or unnatural to them.  Being fired from such a low paying job may make developing other skills a necessity.  Think of the guy working at McDonald's who could be trained to be a lineman for the electric company or a truck driver, or the truck driver who could (if he had more ambition, and was willing to give up an income for a few months to go to trade school) be a mechanic on jet engines.\n- If everyone is held to the same minimum wage, everyone's costs, therefore the price they charge, goes up.  Charging more money lets them afford the more expensive workers.\n- If workers get more expensive, long term investments in mechanization become more attractive.  This lowers costs in the long run, and creates jobs that pay more than the original menial job.  All that extra money everyone has because the price of everything is so low due to mechanization means they have plenty of money to spend on luxuries they would never have previously considered, this is called 'Starbucks' and employs lots of people.\n- Even if the worker does lose his job, modern unemployment insurance schemes will make that relatively painless to the old 'free market' system of going to debtors prison or indentured servitude.<p>A-priori economic arguments are bullshit.  It is perfectly possible to prove convincingly that in a system without a government private security firms would enforce law and order.  We can be convinced of this because we don't know all the reasons this fails in practice, due to our imperfect understanding of the world.  The fact that in every single instance that there has been a lack of a functional police force for more than a few hours things go totally batshit insane should render any such 'convincing' argument totally absurd.",1248505422

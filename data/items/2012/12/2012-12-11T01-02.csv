We could preemptively compute the result to hide its latency.<p>These were not the problem here.
The problem here was that part of the computation of the result is redone each time.<p>Sharing parts of the computation between the invocations was not trivial, and to do this, they found it easier to move the computation to the template loading time (""compile time"").",1355189673

- Donate my time. I would love to do that for a non profit. 
- Get a job. I can't just get a job though, I would need to find a sponsor and apply for an H1B visa. It is December and H1B applications don't start until April next year. Even if approved I wouldn't be able to start working until October next year. That's 10 months. I would like to keep myself busy in the meantime.
- Work on a personal project. I wish I had one that I was passionate about, since this would be a good time to work on it, but I don't.
- Contribute to Open Source.<p>In an ideal world I would be able to volunteer and work with a smart group of people that would allow me meet some developers in the city, keep my skills up to date, contribute something valuable and have something to show for this time when I start looking for that H1B sponsor.<p>Actually, in an ideal world I wouldn't be in this situation. The H4 visa wouldn't be so restrictive and I could just continue with my freelancing work since I did it before I came here and there is no difference where in the world I am to do it.

It's also my impression that Microsoft has introduced fewer breaking changes into .NET during that period  though again, that might just be a symptom of me being more tuned into the Apple ecosystem. Was there anything similar to what Apple did to Carbon developers a few years back, abruptly deprecating most of the framework just a few months before an OS release?<p>And Apple has been accused of having the opposite problem  writing APIs just for the ""showcase"" applications. Very often the first version of an API will be great for recreating Apple's demos, but when you need to go past that, the framework is either unhelpful or actually gets in your way. (I'd like to offer some good examples, but they're eluding me at the moment. I know I've seen a number of complaints along these lines on the Cocoa-Dev mailing list over the years.)<p>IMO, the reason for Apple's good relationship with developers look more like this:<p> It's UNIX, which developers have always loved for fairly well-known reasons.<p> Microsoft entered the last decade pretty much universally despised. Many developers would flat-out refuse to work there, despite it being a hugely successful company with generous compensation, just because association with Microsoft was so very uncool.<p> Apple sold boutique computers to consumers and professionals. People who bought Apple computers were signaling ""I actively seek out and pay for experiences that I like better."" This meant Apple's user base has generally been disproportionately profitable for apps targeted at those markets.<p> Related to the second point, Apple was the major alternative at a time when technophiles wanted to get away from Microsoft.

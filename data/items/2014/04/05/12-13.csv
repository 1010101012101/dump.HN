He gave few convincing (me) examples and then introduced the idea of formal specifications.<p>The formal specification allows you to find design bugs, before writing any code. An anecdote about XBox memory model is given: a certain hardware bug (in the memory unit) once made it&#x27;s way into production would stop any XBox after 4 hours of using it. The bug wouldn&#x27;t be found using any methods the hardware manufacturer was using.<p>The bug was found due to an engineer who was formally specifying the memory model. He provided a bug description and the response was: &quot;Invalid, the system cannot come into this state&quot;. The engineer than responded with a scenario leading to the state using the rules which governed the memory model. Eventually the bug was fixed.<p>Leslie moved to more down to earth examples: finding greatest common divisor (Euclid&#x27;s algorithm) and QuickSort. They were expressed in pseudocode and with minor adjustments as a TLA spec.<p>In all examples the same conclusion was given: having written only the code it would be very difficult to find the design bugs.",1396702681

7536792,comment,7536246,7536246,6,0,einhverfr,,,"I do most of my work with Perl, rather than Python, but in Perl there are several kinds of stock import-level side-effects which are actually quite helpful.  These are pretty light-weight though.  They boil down to:<p>1.  Global lexical changes to Perl.  Sometimes this is the whole point of an import (for example Carp::Always, which typically turns any warning or exception string into a full stack dump).  I can&#x27;t imagine doing something like this in Python.  However making soemthing like this work properly without breaking too many things requires a heck of a lot of forethought  Yes, even Carp::Always may break something.<p>2.  Manipulation of the importing module&#x27;s symbol table.  This is important for lexical extensions to Perl that you don&#x27;t want to be global (for example Moo, Moose, and PGObject::Util::DBMethod).  Among other things this allows MOPs to be added with greater sophistication than the language typically allows.  I am not a Python guru but I could imagine metaprogramming side effects to be useful in setting up a consistent and powerful environment.<p>The problem the author describes is something which is different though, which not only is a side effect issue but also a violation of separation of concerns.  There are certain problems you do not want to solve at import time, and connecting with/configuring external components is almost always one of them.<p>Why?  Because integration with external components is almost always something you want the fine-tuning and decision-making to reside with the application developer.  That&#x27;s very different than setting up a consistent lexical programming environment for use (which is what the acceptable side effects do).",1396700070

This might be a browser / HTML issue though, I tried adding a &quot;title&quot; tag but that didn&#x27;t fix it.<p>Updated bookmarklet below:<p><pre><code>    javascript:window.location=window.location+&#x27;&title=&#x27;+document.title.replace(/[^A-Za-z0-9]/g, &quot;_&quot;);</code></pre>",1396699723

If that&#x27;s true, i don&#x27;t think there is any IDE that can top that number and it explains why Visual Studio is the best tool for (almost any) job.<p>People should realize that Visual Studio is not solely C#, it&#x27;s NodeJS, PHP, Mono, Python, javascript and so much more in one environment (with a good autocompletion). If you have Windows and are a developer, i suggest you to install one of the Express editions, just to try it out.<p>I must admit, not everything is &quot;as awesome as it is&quot; in the express versions because of some limitations on extensions, but in my experience, you can do everything you need in the Express editions. But i don&#x27;t think visual studio wouldn&#x27;t be as good as it is, if it was free or opensource. (replacing 1200 developers would be very hard).<p>PS. Can anyone confirm my statement of 1200 developers/freelancers? I really think that&#x27;s the number the Visual Studio lead developer mentioned.",1396699713

It took her maybe 6 weeks to fill her schedule and she turned it off.<p>Note a photo of a smiling female is the best creative for CTR, and narrowing the demographic in her use case was simple: females within 15 miles of her office, aged 25-45, in certain income range. We think the average lead who actually called probably saw her ad 6 or 7 times before clicking.<p>OP may have valid criticisms of FB ads, but in our case it was a <i>massive</i> success. Spending a couple bucks to acquire a client w a LTV over $1000 is a no-brainer.<p>Again, YMMV but if you use it right FB can be a fantastic tool.",1396699510

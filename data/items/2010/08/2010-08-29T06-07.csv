1643322,comment,1642340,1643298,0,0,chrischen,,,"Buddhism isn't really a religion like Christianity is. There are no faith-based assumptions in Buddhism and it makes no claim to anything you can't reason yourself independently (as far as I know). I think you should read up on it a bit before lumping it with traditional religions. I don't think your infinite monkey theorem applies to Buddhism because it doesn't have prophecies (afaik) or literal descriptions of how the universe was created. In fact, based on what I reAd I don't think buddhists even worship a god. A Buddha seems to be just a description of a state of spiritual enlightenment.<p>And a trait with most religions is that adherence needs to be exclusive from other religions. From what I learned from the simpsons, buddhists are allowed to practice other religions. That's another sign Buddhism isn't just another branch of Christianity.",1283065028

However, other ""religions"" such as Buddhism and Hinduism have spoken experientially of Nothing, and the universe arising out of Nothing. This has been misunderstood/misinterpreted as ""nihilism"" by the west.<p>Refer ""Ashtavakra Gita"" and ancient text, for example.",1283062894

The whole point I was trying to make is that women are deciding to stay away from engineering before being exposed to any of that.<p>A 17 year old who decides she's not going to take cs101 hasn't been treated poorly by awkward coworkers for years. she hasn't had trouble getting hired because of gender bias. She hasn't been disparaged in front of her tech peers.<p>And yet she still decides to not go into CS. I still maintain that whatever brought about that decision (maybe gender roles from an early age or being put off by awkward teenage nerds... whatever) really has nothing to do with the tech industry. Today's tech industry is a result of that bias not the cause of it.",1283062786

The other ones I'm not sure about but I agree that women have entered those industries and it is because those industries started being proactive about recruiting women much earlier than the tech industry. Most things that are male dominated are simply because of historical accidents and nothing else. As soon as women are given the chance they tend to step up and outperform the men. Education is one example I can think of but I am sure there are many other instances.",1283062548

Around 2000 yrs ago, they were simplified into ""Clerical script"", and many lost their pictorial resemblance. When new phonetic characters were created (i.e. one component semantic, the other phonetic) there were many choices of what to use as phonetic (e.g. any of 体提替etc could have been chosen for righthand side of ""ti"" to sneeze) and the one providing the most semantic clues is often chosen.<p>Another example of ""ti"" with mouth radical is 啼, meaning ""to cry"". The 帝 on the right (actually ""di"", close enough) looks like an eye (立) with tears flowing down (冖 and 巾).<p>I believe the reason I've had character amnesia as a foreign learner of Chinese in the past is because I was initially never shown how to ""spell"" characters into their components. One of the first characters I learnt was 喜 in 喜欢. I was told to practise writing it many times over until I knew it. But I needed to learn it as being spelt as 士口八一口 before I could remember it easily.",1283062364

The documentations are great, the Rails Guide is great (and very, very thorough and approachable), and the community is really active.  As DHH said, all the arguments don't matter much once you start using Rails, since everything will all make sense (I believe this was in Rails keynote in 2009, he was referring to the debates between implementing .first, .second to the Array class, and he pointed out that these decisions were made to help developers think better and more expressive in their code and thus become happier -- and he's totally right!)",1283061775

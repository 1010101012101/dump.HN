It's just some guy calling people names, airing personal dirty laundry on his petty little web log, and then complaining about how poor he is (""I wrote Mongrel and then my career was <i>ruined</i>"").<p>I'm sure he's a smart guy, but he manages to make himself look totally unprofessional.",1199137441

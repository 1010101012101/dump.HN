It helped for me.<p>> ...but the device and app work great for what they do.<p>That was NOT my experience with the app. I think it&#x27;s pathetic they decided to try to be their own ecosystem instead of being part of HealthKit, but that&#x27;s not their big sin.<p>In the two or so years I used a Fitbit the app only got worse. Food logging was repeatedly changed, losing features, and getting harder and harder to use. They later changed exercise entry to make it work better for runners and harder for everything else. They took FOREVER to update from iOS 6 style interfaces to iOS 7.<p>But the big thing, the KILLER thing, was that all my data was corrupted by a bug they knew about and refused to fix. There was an option to adjust your daily calorie goals based on activity (or something like that). Having that on used to be the default, but it caused all sorts of problems. I only found that out after noticing tons of my old data had almost exactly the same calorie count each day. Like within 10 calories.<p>After numerous support emails (their support system was terrible) I was finally told to turn that option off. They <i>knew</i> it caused issues, that&#x27;s why they started turning it off by default. But they didn&#x27;t tell people who had it on about the issues it caused or detect if they were hitting the bug. They fixed it for new users and left older users screwed.<p>So I have 2+ years of useless fitness data in FitBit. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it can be exported for free or put in HealthKit, the data is junk.<p>I don&#x27;t remember having a single positive interaction with FitBit over support or other problems. They were at best neutral. My opinion of them went lower and lower and lower over time.",1431032228
9508258,comment,9507085,9508108,0,0,beeworker,,,"One difference is flow control. When you call a function, all the arguments are evaluated before being passed into the function. If you want to delay evaluation, you have to wrap the argument values in a function. When you call a macro, the text forms get passed with no evaluation.<p>Say Clojure forgot to ship with the boolean &quot;or&quot;. &quot;or&quot; should evaluate its arguments one at a time (to allow for short circuiting) and return the first non-false value. You could do this with functions, but you have the source-level overhead of manually wrapping everything, and performance overhead of defining and passing an anonymous function for each argument. With a macro, at compile time you just translate the &quot;or&quot; macro into a simpler form that uses &quot;if&quot;. This is how Clojure actually implements &quot;or&quot;:<p><pre><code>    (defmacro or
      &quot;Evaluates exprs one at a time, from left to right. If a form
      returns a logical true value, or returns that value and doesn&#x27;t
      evaluate any of the other expressions, otherwise it returns the
      value of the last expression. (or) returns nil.&quot;

This seemed to work but the comments/hearts were SUPER FUCKING ANNOYING, I really wish there was a way to disable those covering up the video.

I expect I&#x27;ll get one eventually, but I don&#x27;t expect it to change my life.

I&#x27;m glad the author pointed out the review that sums it up for me. This thing is a watch.

And I haven&#x27;t said that Google sell your data, but they do sell data or at least the product of their analysis from what search results caught on during this holiday season to what people have searched to get to your site and how much time they&#x27;ve spent on it.
Yes that not evil, but they do design virtually every service with a primary goal of generating data from it because that&#x27;s their business model.
And considering that (or a) you use Google, Amazon and Facebook for the majority of your day to day tasks from finding a how to get somewhere, to getting updates on news and topics of interest to connecting with people they can exert more influence on you than most intelligence agencies out there.<p>Say PlanetBucks whats to increase the amount of Moppachinos you drink a day, how about paying Koogle to ensure that the routes it suggest when you walk to your friend bring you past one?

Tobacco companies used give out cigarettes for free to everything from soldiers to school kids, yeah they also wanted to ensure that their products are great.<p>Also this always gives me a chuckle:

Markets, surely, are places where we are allowed, even expected, to behave selfishly.<p>I do tend to assume that people will act in what they believe to be their own self-interest. (With some emphasis on &quot;what they <i>believe</i> to be&quot;.)<p>But it&#x27;s not that simple.

It&#x27;s one less car in your lane slowing you down - no different at all from an actual carpooler. The &quot;carpool cheater&quot; is doing you a favor by getting out of your way.

In chapter 7, it introduces the `dolist` macro.<p><pre><code>    DOLIST loops across the items of a list, executing the loop
    body with a variable holding the successive items of the list.
    This is the basic skeleton (leaving out some of the more
    esoteric options):

    (dolist (var list-form)
      body-form*)

    ...For instance:

    CL-USER> (dolist (x &#x27;(1 2 3))
               (print x))
    1
    2
    3
    NIL
</code></pre>
Buried in a footnote is this:<p>&quot;DOLIST is similar to Perl&#x27;s `foreach` or Python&#x27;s `for`.  Java added a similar kind of loop construct with the &#x27;enhanced&#x27; for loop in Java 1.5, as part of JSR-201.<p>Notice what a difference macros make.  A Lisp programmer who notices a common pattern in their code can write a macro to give themselves a source-level abstraction of that pattern.  A Java programmer who notices the same pattern has to convince Sun that this particular abstraction is worth adding to the language.  Then Sun has to publish a JSR and convene an industry-wide &quot;expert group&quot; to hash everything out.  That process--according to Sun--takes an average of 18 months.  After that, the compiler writers all have to go upgrade their compilers to support the new feature.  And even once the Java programmer&#x27;s favorite compiler supports the new version of Java, they probably still can&#x27;t use the new feature until they&#x27;re allowed to break source compatibility with older versions of Java.<p>So an annoyance that Common Lisp programmers can resolve for themselves within five minutes plagues Java programmers for years.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/macros-standard-control-constructs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/macros-standard-control-cons...</a>",1431029983

The NSA isn&#x27;t some shadow government wanting to rule the world, they did some nasty stuff, some of it is probably illegal and for the rest they&#x27;ve surely stepped out of their boundaries with very loose interpretations of laws and executive orders but even the biggest critic of the NSA can&#x27;t say they&#x27;ve done it for their own reasons and not in order to ensure the security of the United States.
And when people say well what if country X will become a brutal dictatorship, well in that case they can put you in jail on a whim, again this isn&#x27;t a case for mass surveillance, or for the NSA it&#x27;s just a simple truth. So while i do see the NSA spying on Americans on US soil a violation of their mandate, i don&#x27;t see it as some mile stone in the US becoming North Korea or East Germany for that matter.<p>But back to Google et al, everything i buy, every peace of information i consume, half the people i talk to, how i get from place to place and what i get exposed to in the process, where i am know, and heck even what i type as we speak is being tracked, analyzed and stored not by the NSA but by the 100&#x27;s of various companies from Google to that brand new hot machine learning add network startup that just won TechCruch Disrupt last week. 
Yes they can&#x27;t put me in jail, but the amount of control they can exert on you isn&#x27;t that far from incarceration when you actually use it in it&#x27;s broadest term, there are countries with prison systems that don&#x27;t look like Riker&#x27;s check out Bastøy Prison for example. ;)
If you want to go full on tin foil hat then 1984 describes an incarcerated society, and sorry but if you compare what the NSA to what Google et al. are doing to they the latter is much much closer to a proto 1984 society than the former.",1431029931

9507904,comment,9507085,9507085,0,0,kazinator,,,"I&#x27;m hacking on TXR these days which contains a Lisp dialect called TXR Lisp. Lisp hacking and research is fun, in particular if you have the freedom of your own dialect.<p>The current public release TXR Lisp still has an embarrassingly shoddy implementation of &quot;places&quot;: expressions which not only evaluate, but serve as assignable locations. I implemented most of the place-manipulating operators (set, inc, push, ...) as special forms, and only a small repertoire of places is hard-coded in the interpreter. (And that, by the way, creates one of the impediments against going to a compiler.)<p>I have thrown all that out and created a macro-based system for places. Instead of copying the Common Lisp one, I drummed up something new.<p>Common Lisp lets programmers register assignment places as &quot;setf expanders&quot; which return five values: lists of temporary variables, access and store forms and such. (Google for &quot;CLHS get-setf-expansion&quot;).<p>I have taken a somewhat different, though necessarily closely-related approach. The creator of a new place provides two or three functions. These functions take a place and a piece of code, and wrap it with macrolets for accessing the place. These macrolets are given names that the caller specifies. Of course, I have a macro for writing these functions as a capsule.<p>The three functions provide a way for handling the access and update of a place, a simple store to a place without an access, and the deletion of a place.<p>This third item is new. In TXR Lisp, there is a del operator: a place can be vaporized.   Not all places support deletion, but many do. For instance you can do (del [some-vector 3]) to delete an item from a vector. Or a range. Hashes support deletion. (del (car x)) works: what happens when you delete the car of a cons cell is that the cdr is popped, and the popped item is transferred into the car. Thus if x holds (1 2 3),  the (2 3) part is popped to produce (3) and the 2 moves into the car, resulting in X holding (2 3). (<i>I just realized that we need place insertion to complement place deletion!</i>)<p>Here is how a (vecref <vector> <index>) place is defined:<p><pre><code>   (defplace (vecref vector index :whole args) body
     (getter setter
       (with-gensyms (vec-sym ind-sym)
         ^(rlet ((,vec-sym ,vector)
                 (,ind-sym ,index))
            (macrolet ((,getter () ^(vecref ,&#x27;,vec-sym ,&#x27;,ind-sym))
                       (,setter (val) ^(refset ,&#x27;,vec-sym ,&#x27;,ind-sym ,val)))
               ,*body))))
     (ssetter
       ^(macrolet ((,ssetter (val) ^(refset ,*&#x27;,args ,val)))
          ,*body))
     (deleter
       (with-gensyms (vec-sym ind-sym)
         ^(rlet ((,vec-sym ,vector)
                 (,ind-sym ,index))
            (macrolet ((,deleter ()
                          ^(prog1 (vecref ,&#x27;,vec-sym ,&#x27;,ind-sym)
                                  (replace-vec ,&#x27;,vec-sym nil
                                               ,&#x27;,ind-sym (succ ,&#x27;,ind-sym)))))
              ,*body)))))

</code></pre>
[[ Digression: what is rlet in the above?<p>The rlet macro is something I just invented days ago. It is like let, but it detects and optimizes cases when a symbol is bound to another symbol, and turns these into symbol macrolets. Demo:<p><pre><code>  $ ./txr -p &quot;(sys:expand &#x27;(rlet ((a b) (c (form))) (list a b c)))&quot;
  (let ((c (form))) (list b b c))
</code></pre>
Look, the (a b) disappeared in the form expansion, and b was replaced by a. That&#x27;s because the macro expansion is this:<p><pre><code>  $ ./txr -p &quot;(macroexpand &#x27;(rlet ((a b) (c (form))) (list a b c)))&quot;
  (symacrolet ((a b)) (let ((c (form))) (list a b c)))
</code></pre>
rlet also propagates simple constants, as shown by the variable d:<p><pre><code>  $ ./txr -p &quot;(sys:expand &#x27;(rlet ((a b) (c (form)) (d 42)) (list a b c d)))&quot;
  (let ((c (form))) (list b b c 42))
</code></pre>
Of course, let can only be replaced by rlet in certain circumstances, when we don&#x27;t rely on the binding actually providing storage semantics. Above, we can only replace a with b, if a is not assigned anywhere. And since d is replaced with 42 blindly, it <i>cannot</i> be assigned.<p>Obviously, rlet is something you don&#x27;t need if you have an optimizing compiler which eliminates useless temporary variables and propagates constants! I just wanted nicer expansions from the places system.]]<p>So anyway, the defplace creates three functions which provide advice for how to correctly access, update and delete a place. They wrap this advice, which takes the form of local functions or macros, and any additional lexical definitions they need, around a supplied piece of code, and that code can refer to that.<p>Here is how this advice is used, in the implementation of the swap operator. This shows you the real beauty of the system, because we can write a completely robust swap, but we don&#x27;t have to use anything resembling CL&#x27;s get-setf-expansion and its five cumbersome return values:<p><pre><code>  (defmacro swap (place-0 place-1 :env env)
    (with-gensyms (tmp)
      (with-update-expander (getter-0 setter-0) place-0 env
        (with-update-expander (getter-1 setter-1) place-1 env
          ^(let ((,tmp (,getter-0)))
             (,setter-0 (,getter-1))
             (,setter-1 ,tmp))))))
</code></pre>
What is the env doing there? We have to pass the macro-time environment down, because places can be macros! For instance what if we do (swap a b), but a is actually a lexical symbol macro for (car x) and b is something similar: the with-update-expander macro will take care of expanding these places, so it fetches the correct advice for the expanded places.<p>So note how we have a completely naive looking pieces of code, a three point swap:<p><pre><code>          ^(let ((,tmp (,getter-0)))
             (,setter-0 (,getter-1))
             (,setter-1 ,tmp))))))
</code></pre>
All we did was generate some gensyms, use a couple of macros to obtain the place-accessing expertise from some generated lexical helpers, and then wrote a straightforward swap.<p><pre><code>  $ ./txr -p &quot;(sys:expand &#x27;(swap a b))&quot;
  (let ((#:g0044 a)) (sys:setq a b) (sys:setq b #:g0044))

  $ ./txr -p &quot;(sys:expand &#x27;(swap (car c) (cdr c)))&quot;
  (let ((#:g0044 (car c))) (sys:rplaca c (cdr c)) (sys:rplacd c #:g0044))

  $ ./txr -p &quot;(sys:expand &#x27;(swap 1 2))&quot;
  ./txr: unhandled exception of type eval-error:
  ./txr: during expansion at string:1 of form (swap 1 2)
  ./txr: message: form 1 is not syntax denoting an assignable place

  $ ./txr -p &quot;(sys:expand &#x27;(swap [f x] [g y]))&quot;
  (let ((#:g0067 [f x])) (let ((#:g0056 [g y])) (let ((#:g0044 #:g0067))
  (sys:setq f (sys:dwim-set f x #:g0056)) (sys:setq g (sys:dwim-set g y #:g0044)) #:g0044)))
</code></pre>
Note the [] notation is completely generic, so f and x could be lists (or vectors, hashes, strings). In this case, f and x are themselves expected to be places. Thus [f x] must be a place, and  f also must be a place. The reason is that if we manipulate a list, we may have to assign the new list to the old variable. In general, sys:dwim-set could cons up a new list.<p>So in summary, Lisp is always fresh and keeps me interested in hacking. Even old things (solved problems like assignment places) can be looked at in a new light.<p>Check out this recursive implementation of shift, which is like Common Lisp&#x27;s shiftf:<p><pre><code>  (defmacro shift (:env env . places)
    (tree-case places
      (() (eval-err &quot;shift: need at least two arguments&quot;))
      ((place) (eval-err &quot;shift: need at least two arguments&quot;))
      ((place newvalue)
       (with-update-expander (getter setter) place env
          ^(prog1 (,getter) (,setter ,newvalue))))
      ((place . others)
        (with-update-expander (getter setter) place env
          ^(prog1 (,getter) (,setter (shift ,*others)))))))

  $ ./txr -p &quot;(sys:expand &#x27;(shift a b c d))&quot;
  (prog1 a (sys:setq a (prog1 b (sys:setq b (prog1 c (sys:setq c d))))))</code></pre>",1431029247

There&#x27;s a street running along the row of houses, and a street at each end.<p>Now, the land slides 1/2 plot to the right. To simplify this model, the slide happens overnight.<p>This means that each house slides right 1/2 plot. All of the cars slide 1/2 plot to the right. The yards and all the flowers slide 1/2 plot to the right.<p>And the road slides 1/2 plot to the right.<p>So this means that one of these residents now owns 1/2 plot of public roadway. Are they allowed to toll drivers for using their roadway?<p>The city (or county or state) now owns 1/2 plot of yard (and 1/2 of a house), which isn&#x27;t quite as useful to them as the 1/2 plot of roadway they had before the shift.<p>Whichever governmental body that has authority could theoretically solve this by shifting all property lines to the right by 1/2 plot. This would line up the spots on the Earth&#x27;s spherical surface (the land estate) with the objects held there by gravity and other forces (buildings and possessions).<p>---<p>Of course, the complicating force here is Human Boredom; since these changes happen over decades instead of a night, most people are not content to have the problem solved logically, as most people see problems as tools they can use as a reason to talk to other people.",1431029025

The vector space R^n is defined as the collection of all lists of n real numbers, so you are right in that sense.<p>But usually when people say that a vector &quot;is&quot; a list of numbers, they mean that if you choose a coordinate system, then the coordinates of a vector uniquely identify it. This is exactly analogous to locations on the earth being uniquely identified by their latitude and longitude: we first have to make a (somewhat arbitrary) choice of coordinates. You wouldn&#x27;t say that a point on the earth &quot;is&quot; a pair of numbers, though. The case of R^n is confusing, because if you choose the usual coordinate system, then the coordinates of a vector are the same list of numbers as the vector itself.<p>I like to think of tensors as functions that map some number of vectors to some other number of vectors. But you can add together two tensors (with the same number of inputs and outputs) or multiply a tensor by a number, so you can also think of them as vectors in some other vector space.",1431028987

He&#x27;s a FTE at a medium-sized company, and his freelance work is approaching his normal FTE salary (which is already considerable, imo). He&#x27;s been so overworked with the freelance stuff that he&#x27;s been considering cutting it down. What he wound up doing was hiring a bookkeeper (online service) to manage invoices, taxes, etc, and a virtual assistant (zirtual.com I think) to respond to emails and such. He&#x27;s been doing both for about a month, and he&#x27;s cut back his hours immensely while still making the same amount of money. If you&#x27;re concerned about having to choose, you might want to look into hiring virtual assistants to help you out.<p>Good luck! Personally, I&#x27;m jealous.

Everyone tries to cram Javascript into applications it&#x27;s completely unsuitable for like desktop non-browser 3D gaming or encryption.  It is an enabler of pervasive surveillance by marketers and a huge security risk for the privacy-conscious.

(Jean Pierre Pernaud&#x27;s kid (a famous TV anchor) tried it while speeding on an highway at 190km/h where it was limited at 90km/h. (that was what a local police guy said while sharing a beer. He may have lied, but this story even if it false is so close to what people feel that I can accept it as true enough)).<p>For free loading in transport you can get annoyed (a 5$ crime). For forgetting to pay wages or bills, not enforcing the basics of security in your activity or even forgetting to pay social charges(count in k$), even if you are caught on the spots you will be hardly annoyed and humilated.<p>They are poor&#x27;s crimes and rich&#x27;s crimes (that cost more to the collectivity).<p>A white business man not respecting the law using like being a proven spammer (artprice) and exploiting his salarymen is an exemple to the society. An arab business man providing good weed and exploiting his «cousins» is a criminal. \nDrug dealers at the bottom of the hierarchy are paid like at the minimum rate regarding the risks taken.<p>Since the pushers are coloured and there is quite a discrimination, thus the society makes it easier for the kingpin to have cheap dedicated workforce. Business is business, not a charitative association. And the rules of business applies all alike. You cant get rich without capital and Income < outcome.<p>And fiscal evasion is not sanctionned on the long run if you accept to finally pay your due: fiscal administration will consent to close their eyes on some points.<p>Fiscal inequality is at its top. VAT makes it hard for people not to be taxed, and this is the biggest origin of taxes. On the other hand fiscal laws makes it easier for the richer to evade the taxes on income and patrimonial.<p>The poor get poorer and more subject to social violence, while rich get richer and more subject to physical violence. In a closed system if you compress a part, the compression has to propagate somewhere.<p>Btw, the system is truly meritocratic. To get to be a journalist you have very fair selection after highschool.<p>But oddly enough «sectorisation of the school maps» make it harder for poor kids to reach the good high schools that are statistically bound to be able to reach the «entry level» of the honestly fairly selective meritocratic system.\nI don&#x27;t say you can&#x27;t be successful. I just say a system is unfair when some kids begins life with a 10 kg loaded bag, and others none and you are being required to first do 42km under a chrono before beginning to compete a fair competition.<p>That may explain why the journalists that are scared of going beyond the «périphérique» (the border of Paris) often (not always) makes it look like this place is another planet when they write articles.

(I know those two examples you picked are not representative of the typical SaaS, but I&#x27;m going to take this in another direction anyhow.)<p>This might be news to much of the peanut gallery, so here we go: COGS (cost-of-goods-sold: servers, etc) is not <i>nearly</i> the dominant hard cost associated with free trials.  It is, overwhelmingly, cost of customer acquisition -- i.e. the marketing spend required to attract one customer at the margin.  B2B SaaS companies routinely pay hundreds of dollars to get one new account at the typical $29 to $249 monthly price points.<p>Why do we do this?  Because of the SaaS LTV formula: monthly price / churn rate.  If you have a mediocre-ish 5% churn, then a $30 a month account is worth $600.  If you can buy them for $200 apiece, why not do so?  (&quot;Massive stress-inducing cashflow crunches!&quot;  Good answer, and that&#x27;s the classic reason why SaaS companies raise money despite having near-zero COGS and products which can be bootstrapped to market.)<p>$200 per new account businesses might imply, in a card-not-required-upfront model, 2% conversion rates on $4 trials which have converted at 25% from $1 clicks.  Or, in a card-required-upfront-model, 25% conversion rate from trial, $10+ clicks.",1407087819

8128483,comment,8124027,8127959,2,0,plam3ns,,,"> Would support have received, investigated, fixed the issue and uploaded fixed binaries before we finished our two-week assignment?<p>While I can&#x27;t talk in the name of LW, as a former customer I can assert that we had not a single support case which took more than 2 days (where some have been hairy). The main reason is that there is no &quot;first level support&quot; - you talk directly with the authors of the complier/IDE/libs. And they fundamentally know their product and over the decade or two they have seen lot of possible misinteractions of the product with the underlying (often misconfgured) OS/networking/UI/.. etc. Bugs in LW are mostly in corner cases which can be solved usually with a small patch (where it&#x27;s distribution is less painfull as in most other products - being a Common Lisp - they sometims can issue a patch even for a running system..) The only time their team needed about 3 weeks (where I&#x27;m not the only customer) has been, when we requested the introduction of a new data type in the language and producing a highly optimized machine code for it (try this with MS/Apple/Oracle or any of the open source languages in terms of money/time/quiality...). This has been a request for a change, a not a but report, which affects their compiler infrastructure for at least Win32/64, OSX, Linux and FreeBSD. I got the new functionality as part of the support contract! No additional cent, even it&#x27;s not a bug! If you know how multiplatform compilers look inside, you will know that what they did is impressive and has been delivered essentially for free.<p>> Believe it or not our problems existed (professor included, happened during assignment reviews) but as new users we decided to just finish the assignment and move on. Subconsciously we felt it was a better return of investment for our time.<p>I believe you. That&#x27;s why I still wonder why your professor hasn&#x27;t taken action on it. While you can have been young and not enough knowledgable about CL, he IS the one who knows not only CL, but also LW. So - from what you tell me I see only that you have got a bad beat by being with the wrong situation during exams and drawing conclusions about the general state of LW, which is actually quite different (at least for the most of it&#x27;s users) from what you describe.<p>> User Experience 101: when new users of your product face problems, they don&#x27;t contact support and just leave as soon as possible for an alternative.<p>This is for sure true for mass products for unqualified public (for example an Iphone or a car). But take any essentially complex software (Let say the JVM or a helicopter or a bigger cargo ship or in our case LW). If it delivers real value - customers and producers often work hand in hand, setup organization and procedures to deal with problems on both sides etc. to resolve the problems, because usually the net gain of a working product is for the customer is higher than a couple of hiccups or some $$$. This has been and is still a working model for most of the IT industry (at least in the bigger part of the IT industry where products/services are payed with money and responsibility is guaranteed by at least through contracts).<p>> Support is there for people who already use the product and/or have no alternatives (which LispWorks has many).<p>Of course the support is for people who use a product :) And of course if the car breaks which you drive, even if you have alternatives, usually you go to a garage to get it repaired instead of just throwing it away and byuing a new one :) And of course there are alternatives to LW, some with great communities, and in all of which from time to time you also need support, as soon you are a customer :) But you know that :)",1407086539

You&#x27;re right, that one person&#x27;s censorship is another person&#x27;s curation - though I would personally go a step further and say that curation is a subset of censorship, without the negative connotations. Whether it is or not depends on whether you agree with the net effect.<p>>A text-based submission puts the words of the author at the very top in a prominent and unfair position for attention.<p>I guess we would disagree here, since I don&#x27;t believe it is unfair. The prominence of the author&#x27;s post is the entire point of a text post - the author is asking a question or presenting a product or something, and the rest of the thread is a reaction to that (or reactions to reactions, etc.) It&#x27;s implicit to the medium that the tree has a root.<p>Reducing legibility and reducing prominence are two different things, at least to me. I have no problem at all with upvotes or downvotes affecting where subthreads wind up in the sorting order - that&#x27;s precisely what they should do. But why also make content more difficult to read as well?<p>If anything, that makes those elements more prominent, as it send a visual cue that &quot;this is something you can easily ignore as it&#x27;s not worth your time,&quot; which may not be the case.<p>Keeping comments and text posts legible forces people to actually read the content, consider it on its own merit and act accordingly (downvote, upvote, ignore, respond, whatever).

It makes code easier to read and more pleasing to the eye, just like any other text.<p>Besides personal preference, I think there are two main reasons people avoid proportional fonts: column alignment and two-space indents.<p>Two-space indents are an unfortunate trend in coding styles, because they practically mandate the use of a monospaced font to see the indentation. I use tabs for indentation, which let each developer adjust the visual indentation to suit their own eyes. Four-space indents are OK too.<p>I would love to see programmer&#x27;s editors provide a way to control the amount of visual indentation that each leading space represents.<p>Column alignment of course is not possible with proportional fonts, but that&#x27;s an easy problem to solve: don&#x27;t do it. Instead of this:<p><pre><code>  void DoSomethingWithStuff(SomeReallyFancyTypeName thing,\n                            string                  name\n                            int                     count,\n                            bool                    condition);\n</code></pre>\nWrite this:<p><pre><code>  void DoSomethingWithStuff(\n      SomeReallyFancyTypeName thing,\n      string name\n      int count,\n      bool condition\n  );\n</code></pre>\nWhile you lose the advantage of seeing all the parameter names lined up, it becomes much easier to visually associate each name with its type. My eyes tend to wander when I have to scan across a wide horizontal gap to match things up.<p>This style also leads to much shorter line lengths as can be seen here, and it&#x27;s easier to maintain: You don&#x27;t have to realign things when you change the length of the function name or one of the type names, or when you add a parameter with a longer name than the ones you have already.<p>A case where column alignment is more useful is ASCII art in comments. I&#x27;ve experimented with using a monospaced font for comments and proportional for code, which solves that problem nicely. But I don&#x27;t use ASCII art much myself, so I went back to proportional for everything.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out these fonts!",1407085795
8128445,comment,8128080,8128080,4,0,caster_cp,,,"From the Internet.org website itself, comes a very timely affirmation: &quot;The future of the world economy is a knowledge economy - the Internet, its backbone&quot;. Should this backbone be on the hands of, or at least controlled by, one single company (or cartel, or association)?\nThis move is a very good strategic move to access the so called &quot;other 3 billion&quot;, and the mixture of tech companies and public services in developing countries has been proven effective (see M-Pesa, an initiative that revolutionized the financial services ecosystem in Kenya). But there are very deep philosophical implications when private companies start taking the role of government on the internet. Nowadays, many public servants do not understand the implications of this &quot;knowledge economy&quot; referenced on the internet.org website. Specially when it relates to the forces that lead to huge market concentrations and even de facto monopolies in these industries (see Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, ...). The irony of this specific initiative is that a company that fights for net neutrality with the EFF against the telcos tries to do the same thing, but at a different layer, in developing countries.\nIn reality, this raises a very important question for the future of the internet: what is the right amount of private interference on services that were previously considered public ones (identification being the most prominent of these nowadays)? Are we heading to a new Bell style monopoly, but at a global scale, nowadays? And what will be the outcome of the very important fight of internet versus infrastructure companies that is going on?\nRegarding these doubts, I really and firmly believe that the most interesting phenomenons will not happen in the US, but on the most unsuspecting countries out there (again, see M-Pesa). We just have to wait and see",1407085747

Before the early 19th century, both spellings of most of these words were acceptable in the UK and the US, because these words came into English both from French and from Latin. It&#x27;s more accurate to say that the UK and the US, when each settled on one of the two spellings as standard, chose to settle differently.<p>This standardization in the US was greatly influenced by Noah Webster and his dictionary. He tended to go with the spelling variant that fit more with how the word was pronounced. His dictionary was influential enough to make those spellings dominant in the US. Those spellings then came to be seen as Americanisms in the UK (even though they had long been acceptable UK spellings...), and so the UK standardized on the other spellings.<p>Webster was also an advocate of spelling simplification, and was responsible for dropping the &#x27;k&#x27; from &#x27;musick&#x27; and &#x27;publick&#x27;, and those were picked up in the UK.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/33844-british-american-word-spelling.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livescience.com/33844-british-american-word-spell...</a>",1407085494

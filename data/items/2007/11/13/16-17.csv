I've only done a bit of J2ME programming for cell phones, but my experience was that the platform felt much more constraining than the language. Java, shmava... It may feel clunky, but it's good enough - for now - in the mobile space.",1194972462

It was probably just the expedient choice for some reason.</i>""<p>They're choosing the Java Virtual Machine, not Java itself. Java just happens to the be standard example of a language which targets the JVM. Using the JVM is a prudent choice since many tools already exist which target this platform, it's sandboxed, and it's hardware platform-independent. You already have implementations of many languages targeting the JVM including Java, Python, and Ruby.<p>In fact, the JVM bytecodes are then recompiled to their special VM's object format, called Dalvit. Using the JVM as the common layer allows them to fit into the existing software ecosystem without causing pain for developers and language implementors.",1194972048

79311,comment,79112,79112,0,0,muerdeme,,,"Within the last couple of years, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah! has proven that the internet is a viable marketing environment without involving the radio juggernaut.  Within the first two years of their existence, they had sold 90,000 copies of their debut album by dealing with distribution companies directly.  However, CYHSY! is still an extreme phenomenon.  I think the key to the future of music is making it more efficient for bands to follow this path.  Myspace is cool for bands who don't have the time to make their own website and want to stream some free stuff to fans, but it really sucks for finding new music.  Last.fm is a step in the right direction, but for whatever reason I don't enjoy using it for anything but the charts.  ",1194971752

79309,comment,79133,79133,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It'd be neat to hook this up to RescueTime and see if our perceived productivity sinks match up with actual productivity sinks.  I found that I spend significantly less time on Internet procrastination than I thought I did, and significantly more time with the computer turned off entirely.<p>Also would be neat to correlate this with company size and stage of development.  In my current startup (which is just me doing all the coding), the top productivity sinks are Internet distractions and slow decision-making, because most of the rest don't apply.  In my last employer, the top ones were office distractions, bugs & errors, and working on things we don't finish.<p>And it's interesting how answers might change with hindsight.  A couple months ago, I wrote a library that, if you asked me 2 weeks after I finished it, would've gone into the ""Working on things that don't matter.""  Now I just happened to find another use for it, and it's now a critical part of our infrastructure.",1194971408

79306,comment,78744,78744,0,0,sammyo,,,"Andreessen forgets the PT Barnum effect. Movies are not like a business, they are a carny show. People go shows that grab them, not for something useful that they'll use day to day. H'wood sells vapor, really, literally vapor. That's the principle behind the summer blockbuster, get folks excited, pay $11 and into seats for a wild ride. They are often disappointed in the product, but can't return it and will continue to hope for better from the next preview.<p>It will change when the Charlie Chaplin of youtube arrives. Chaplin made a lot of movies, he eventually started Universal studios with the thought that the creators of the films should get the beneficiary. Two things matter in H'wood, owning the distribution channels and skill at hype. A youtube 'show' gets a certain amount of word of mouth hype but that 'youtube-house' has not seen a true impresario. One thing the impresario/producers need is the lure of the big payoff, that exists for VC's but not for producers. What will trigger massive change in the studio structure is when an investment in a youtube production can trigger a huge payoff to the frontman. Then he can dangle the costs of producing a single show in front of the gamblers. Right now the only big winner for a youtube 'show' is google and they will not front production costs.<p>Shows (movies, TV, Broadway, youtube) are structured very different than a business. They are big for a month, a day, or a few years, then on to the next big thing. Few want version 2.0 of say 'Rainman' (with rare exceptions). But even exceptions are really 'new companies' as opposed to an ongoing offering. There seems to be overlap with the spike of new ventures, but when the venture is sold, all the principals don't leave and go to the next show. After the wrap party, everyone is looking for work. There are support companies with continuation (prop rental, render farms) but the core business is show business.\n",1194971281

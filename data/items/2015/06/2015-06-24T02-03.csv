I didn&#x27;t say that Ohio is more diverse than Silicon Valley. In fact I said Silicon Valley has a diversity problem.<p>The problem is that people who study computer science are mostly white males, so the people qualified for the IT jobs are mostly white males. When a company tries to hire people it goes by resume first. You can&#x27;t tell someone&#x27;s race on a resume. Company get like 500+ resumes week for a position and have to find a way to screen out candidates based on resume. So usually they go by type of college or university degree, like bachelors or higher or degree from a local area college or university. Then throw the rest out. Problem is when they do that they also throw out people who are a minority or female as well without understanding that they are doing so. They also screen out by key words, type of company worked for, number of years of experience, etc. Most people they don&#x27;t even bother to email or call back that they didn&#x27;t get the job.",1435113281

If the Carrier did not need to make a profit, they could upgrade their infrastructure to be totally non blocking.  Alternatively, if the Carrier needed to make a profit, but was okay providing degraded service, they could avoid upgrading infrastructure.<p>But, if they want to do both - Profit + good service, then caps are needed.<p>The competition, btw, is definitely fiber (See what happens to Comcast Service when a fiber competitor comes to town - it gets much better) and wireless (I haven&#x27;t used a wireline carrier in singapore for 2+ months.  All LTE, all the time.)<p>Regarding my limits - the nice things about Tier-1 ISPs (which Comcast is) - is that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> pay for data use, as they engage in what is called &quot;Settlement Free Peering&quot; - what they <i>do</i> pay for is (roughly) Trenches + Vaults + Data Center Real Estate + Power + cooling + security + Chassis + Fiber + Interconnect Ports + Line-Cards.   These are all a function of peak usage, not total usage.  So - outside of peak-usage, which has reliable patterns of behavior, there is no costs to the ISP, or fellow users of the same resources, to your usage.  Peak Usage may be as few as 4 hours/day, or 120 hours/month * 1 gigabit = 54 Terabytes.  In a month, 1 gigabit could theoretically draw 324 Terabytes, so - that&#x27;s 270 Terabytes off Peak + 10 Terabytes on Peak allowance = 280 Terabytes/month.<p>By doing just a bit of scheduling, you don&#x27;t have to pay any extra, the ISPs network isn&#x27;t overloaded, and you have a reasonable allowance of data to work with.<p>Of course, if they start selling 1 Gigabit Service, that&#x27;s a lot of switch ports/chassis/routers/interconnects/etc/etc... they are going to have to upgrade to handle the new peaks.",1435113207

American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.</i><p><i>The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody good as new.
When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly so they would never hurt anybody ever again.</i><p><i>The American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids. And Hitler turned into a baby, Billy Pilgrim supposed. That wasn&#x27;t in the movie. Billy was extrapolating. Everybody turned into a baby, and all humanity, without exception, conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve, he supposed.</i><p>(Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut)",1435112785

We are all different races.  Were you applying for a low-level job (IE: trying to get anything)? You probably would have used it as a stepping-stone for a better job and the employer didn&#x27;t want to spend resources training you.<p>&quot;The formula was largely the same. Most I didn’t hear back from at all. With a few, I had an in-person or Skype interview with the team.&quot;<p>Once again, completely normal.<p>&quot;Yeah, a company in Utah is doing more for diversity than many in Silicon Valley — get over your biases of where you believe real change is championed.&quot;<p>The truth is that you just don&#x27;t have any real-world work experience.<p>&quot;One of the ways my company encourages diversity is by providing fair pay and benefits for all; which includes reimbursement for relocation, the opportunity to work remotely, a generous family leave policy, and flexible scheduling for personal needs&quot;<p>Now you are just sounding entitled.  You aren&#x27;t entitled to any of those things and there are plenty of people in Silicon Valley that are qualified and willing to take the job (which is why you had trouble).

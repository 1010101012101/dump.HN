1289741,comment,1289252,1289601,0,0,grellas,,,"This does <i>not</i> look good for Gizmodo, and I can say this even as someone who does not practice criminal law.<p>Why?<p>1. The REACT unit is a dedicated unit established to fight tech-related crimes, and I would not take it lightly to know that they were investigating my conduct.<p>2. California's stolen property laws would appear to apply here and may well have been violated.<p>3. The much more serious federal Espionage Act of 1996 appears on its face potentially to apply as well - ""Whoever, with intent to convert a trade secret, that is related to or included in a product that is produced for . . . interstate . . . commerce, to the economic benefit of anyone other than the owner thereof, and intending or knowing that the offense will, injure any owner of that trade secret, knowingly . . . steals, or without authorization appropriates, takes, carries away, or conceals, or by fraud, artifice, or deception obtains such information . . . shall . . . be fined under this title [i.e., up to $5 million] or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.""<p>4. The ""intent"" element, normally hard to prove for criminal purposes, is strongly bolstered by facts admitted by Gizmodo (payment for the item, intent to get hands on Apple trade secrets, holding the property for an extended period) and is countered only by what appears to be the merest pretext of an excuse (supposed doubt about the genuineness of the item).<p>Maybe the first amendment will shield Gizmodo, or maybe the D.A., after investigation, will drop the matter, or maybe it is a stunt and Apple ultimately will not press charges, but if I were Gizmodo I would be concerned where this might lead.",1272063560
1289740,comment,1288315,1288534,0,0,sliverstorm,,,"I still don't understand why people are so worried about grocery store discount cards. Ok, so they know my address. That's alright by me; my address exists so everyone can know it. So they know my name correlates to my address; that's alright too, they can find this info in public records.<p>The only possibly sketchy thing is they can correlate my food purchases to me and my address. However, this doesn't bother me personally. I don't care if the world knows I buy one kind of bread instead of another, or that I buy hummus instead of butter. If there are sensitive things you are paranoid about, like personal care products, just don't use the card for those purchases.<p>Either way, they just wind up with spending patterns on food correlated to one individual. The horror. It's not your SSN or passport or any of that jazz. Besides, if advertising became more accurately targeted, I feel that would generally be a good thing. You'd get in touch with products you were genuinely interested in, advertising costs would plummet (causing prices to drop as well), and there'd be less utterly useless cruft in the ads you receive.",1272063519

1289719,comment,1287594,1289507,0,0,hugh3,,,"I think that's a little over the top. Great as Asimov was in many ways, he had his flaws as a writer.<p>Characters and dialogue are probably at the top of the list. I was reading the Foundation series recently and realised that in some of the longer dialogues the characters sounded exactly the same to the point where it was easy to forget who was speaking at any given time, and more to the point it was easy not to care. With the possible exception of the Mule and maybe a few others, the Foundation series doesn't really have any characters, it just has a bunch of puppets who get shuttled around the universe so they can explain the plot to each other.<p>Then we have the ""creepy old man"" vibe which creeps into some of his later works, where every female character (and they crop up at the rate of approximately one per book) is described with a particular emphasis on how her breasts look in whatever outfit she happens to be wearing.<p>But hey, he's a good writer and wrote a lot of interesting stories, plus a few dull ones.

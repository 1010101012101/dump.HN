Providing the link text and a much better interface for inserting links will be provided before production launch. Inserting links is definitely incomplete in the Beta.<p>2. Inserting images is also missing from the Beta but will be included in the production version. We wanted to show the insert image feature when it was implemented with automatic resizing of the actual image (i.e. not just changing the width/height but resampling the image as well). When it does get implemented, we also plan on  releasing drag and drop abilities, auto-sharpening (if you like) and multi-image uploading. We have experience implementing all these features except drag and drop already (see Orbs.com).<p>3. We have a way to do styling changes using ""Named Styles"" which are element/class combinations. This is already implemented but not yet exposed because we want to get the interface for it right first.<p>4. Not sure which context you mean tabs don't work. Probably within the next few days though tab/shift-tab in lists and tables will work as expected. It is on our do very soon list.<p>5. Justification: Based on our interviews, we found that people were unsatisfied with their editors in 3 key areas that we address. It is probably true that in its Beta state, its usefulness is not all there yet. For a better idea of where SnapEditor will be going in the months ahead, see the ""What's Coming"" section.<p>TinyMCE is definitely a major competitor to us. One of the major differences is that TinyMCE cannot do In-Place editing. We don't believe that will be a niche market in the future.

Google actually doesn't protect your keyword from being a ""trigger"" to show ads since they claim that the user intent is to search for ""meeting software"" and both companies have relevance to that query.  Usually, if it's your brand name, you should have an exceedingly high Quality Scores which translates to your competitors paying extremely high CPCs to even show up against your brand.  Try using ""meetingburner - Official Site"" to let people know the other ad is not meetingburner.<p>- The ad copy appears to be using dynamic keyword insertion so it's using keywords being targeted to build the ads so it's something like ""{KeyWord} Software"" and it could be ""Meeting Burner Software"" or ""Online Meeting Software"" depending on the keyword being used but the ad copy can be universally used and not specifically targeted at meetingburner.

I think there is still more work to be done in the WYSIWYG world as all the current editors I've tried in my app seem to either be frustrating to use or too bloated (I love speedy scripts)<p>I have 2 suggestions:<p>1. Could you please release a version without jQuery baked into it, I really don't like it when plugins include jQuery in their source as it's a lot of unnecessary bloat added to the application (and most people have jQuery on their site already or can include it easy enough if they don't).<p>2. I'd love it if you could make each feature (additional options / controls etc) on top of this core an additional module and make sure they don't rely on each other like how jQuery-UI does it. I haven't found a single WYSIWYG editor that does this and it frustrates me because I have a need for an editor with some functionality and not others and would like the ability to not include unnecessary features to reduce file size and improve performance.<p>Then you could release a full version with every single feature baked in, or a minimal version which is just the core and you can add in other features by including the js files for the features you want and enabling them via a config file.<p>If you build the API well enough and snapeditor is popular enough you could even enlist the community help to build plugins for it for features they'd like to see, sublime text does this really well.",1339440516

I'm concerned about the lack of a 17"" model, as this screen's physical width is just about the minimum that can support two side by side pages at comfortable reading font sizes. Pixel density is high enough already that I'm not persuaded more pixels will make smaller fonts any more comfortable, and 15"" simply doesn't approximate two 8.5"" x 11"" pages side by side no matter what the resolution is.  (Put two 8.5"" x 11"" pages over your 17"" MBP screen; note they only hang off the edge by about a half inch.)<p>Full screen apps with the magic pad swipe between them mitigates this somewhat for apps like Mail, Sublime Text, or Terminal, but 1440 x 900 is a poor choice for dual page word processing.<p>That said, after development, my second most common activity is photo triage and editing.  For this, the 15"" retina display could present a far truer representation of what can be expected in the final print.<p>But I'm concerned about the ""less glare"" feature.  I've also always and only purchased the matte screens.  They have no glare, and no false brilliance from the glossy screen.  For photo editing for print work, the matte screens have always felt more accurate.  I'm curious if they've gone to a single screen surface, based on glossy, but with somewhat less glare.  I'm not sure I'd be interested in that.<p>On the plus side, a MBP 17"" only fits in carry on bags that can't quite go in a commuter jet's overhead bin, while the 15"" will fit easily in most any commuter jet compatible bag.<p>That said, the iPad 3 64GB with iPhoto and SnapSeed can ingest and edit a great deal of photos even at today's DSLR resolutions.

We also fix a bunch of issues to do with browser differences. I think you will also like our roadmap which includes many more features not available anywhere else.

The types of people that spend time on HN don't spend time in the real world, where the current state of affairs is <i>very</i> different from what we think it is. Apple gets a lot of hype, and no doubt the iPhone is very successful (because it was a new type of product), but the iPad is no more than than a glorified toy. Once Windows 8 tablets are released and become commonplace, the iPad will stand no chance. The ability to use the same device for casual consumption and for productivity cannot be understated. Try getting out of San Fran for a few days, and you'll start to understand what I'm talking about. There was a similar issue with Android a few years ago, but it seems even the most hardcore iOS fanboys (such as Marco Arment) have finally gotten on the Android train.<p>And don't forget about the TV. The iTV simply will not sell, because people are not going to throw out their existing TVs just so they can get the latest shiny toy from Cupertino. OTOH, MS has huge market- and mind-share in the form of the Xbox 360 (which has been the best-selling console for more than a year). You can already watch Netflix and HBO GO on it, and Amazon Instant support has just been added. Kinect has proven extremely successful, and with Project Glass, all kinds of new mashups are going to become realizable.<p>> I'm sure your imagination of a Windows 8 tablet is vastly superior to an actual real-world iPad.<p><i>Have you been living under a rock?</i> Windows 8 is coming out <i>this October</i>.

(1,2,5 is probably the most natural fingering for the a-minor6 triad)<p>This is a trivial example, of course.  With real music it's usually much more complicated and learning how to handle fingering challenges is one of the more important things you learn as a student of piano.  Even classics often have fingering suggestions included, if not by the original composer than by subsequent editors.",1339439713

I've been through eight hour technical interviews, going from dev to manager to dev for an hour each, solving math puzzles, traversing trees, coding up design patterns, optimizing sql, and realizing, at the end of the day, that after eight hours I actually have no idea what the company does beyond the questions I asked and the material I read on their website.  Part of the problem was that the interviewers weren't coordinating well, so everyone was pretty much just hammering me with tech questions.  Hell, at <i>lunch</i> someone thought it would be clever to ask me how to swap two integers without creating a third integer.<p>Here's the thing - I actually do understand why companies do this.  Many well funded, established companies are just in a state of constant recruitment.  If you can solve math problems, write efficient data structures, optimize sql, withstand the pressure of coding on the spot, and seem like a pleasant enough person to be around, they'll have something for you to do.  Hire.  Step 1 to tech recruitment is to constantly scan who is on the market, identify those who have good credentials and can withstand brutal technical screenings, and make sure you hire them before facebook and google do.  You have a few weeks to do this.  Step 2 is to define the position you are looking for, and if you wait too long, you won't have time to do step 1.  It actually does make some sense.<p>I would recommend a happy medium, because I really didn't want to work for that company after a day of wind sprints, never knowing where I was going or why I was going there.

In the past few years, Microsoft has shown the most direction in 2 decades. Windows, Windows Phone, and Xbox are all converging on the Metro UI (which is a true breath of fresh air), and Microsoft has finally stopped allowing big business to hold back innovation on Windows. Windows 8 dumps the Start Menu, and on ARM, you won't even be able to install any traditional ""Windows"" software - everything will have to be in Metro.<p>Windows 8 tablets are going to be usable for actual productivity, rather than the consumption-focused nature of the iPad. Tablets that can convert into laptops and vice versa are going to become popular in the corporate world in a way that iPads never will, due to their lack of native support for Office.<p>OTOH, there are a lot of people that have grown tired of iOS. It's been out for 5 years now, and little true innovation has taken place since the release of the original iPhone. Upgrades to the iPhone have mostly consisted of adding features that should have been present all along, such as a proper notifications system (which still has problems) and support for 3rd party apps (which should have been present from the beginning). You still can't have widgets on the home screen, and the chance of Apple adding some kind of split-screen view, like you can get in Metro, is <i>extremely</i> slim.<p>As for OS X, it's an absolute nightmare.

4095953,comment,4094179,4094179,0,0,aneth3,,,"""Yelp buries reviews by one-time posters"" might be a more accurate title.<p>Yelp is trying to build a community of reliable reviewers, not display every review of an establishment, because this is a good way to avoid business owners soliciting reviews from friends and family. If those acquaintances are not part of the Yelp community, they don't understand the standards of the community or even what a five star review means. They are not useful reviews so they are filtered. \nCommunity members have a stake in their reputation as a reviewer.<p>This is something like the practice of hellbanning on Hacker News, except implemented with a well considered policy. (Yelp would likely fail quickly if they implemented HN's shamefully poor method.) Yelp could probably do a better job of explaining this to users - it should say ""Yelp displays reviews by experienced reviewers more prominently. Until you establish yourself by writing frequent reviews, yours may be filtered.""",1339438182

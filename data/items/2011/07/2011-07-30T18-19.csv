Unreliable?

Awk is brilliant in its problem space; it's fairly standardized; it's guaranteed to be everywhere. Choosing Awk or Perl or Python is practical--not being a slave to fashion (trapped in the popularity contest you allude to)<p>I think you know this, and I think you know just how practical Python/Perl/Awk/Ruby are, which is why you subtly changed your argument from ""practical"" without qualification to ""managing huge and complex problems"" by the end of your response, even though the parent specifically includes hobby programming in his classification of ""practical"" problems.<p>I think it's cool that you've done ""web, database, scripting, 3D game programming, etc"" in lisp and can even think in lisp.

2826369,comment,2824433,2824498,1,0,rflrob,,,"I'd be surprised if the appellate court could give you a set of criteria for what exactly makes ""a distinctive chemical identity and nature"".<p>Inside the body, your DNA is packed up into chromatin by wrapping around other proteins called histones, and then coiling those thicker strands around itself a few more times. One could make the argument that it's shape is different from isolated DNA, which doesn't have the histones, and is going to be much closer to a short string.  However, trying to make the claim that this is a chemically distinct molecule is dubious at best, since the chemical structure and identity of the DNA molecule is unchanged.<p>There are, however, chemical modifications to the DNA itself that that may not get preserved in the extraction technique (but that really depends on your technique), and almost certainly won't be preserved if you need to amplify your sample to sequence it.  The most common way is to put a methyl group (CH3) onto a particular part of the DNA molecule.  Single-molecule sequencing techniques exist (but aren't comparably cheap to Illumina or SOLID sequencing yet) that would preserve this chemical structure.<p>Finally, Illumina sequencing (and probably SOLID too, though I'm not sure) involves adding on extra sequences at the end of your DNA fragments, which allow the sequencer to start it's work. I'd doubt if the patent covers this approach, so doing high-throughput genome sequencing like this ought to be fine, based on their ""markedly different structure"" standard, but who knows what the court would actually say.<p><i>But the appellate decision Friday rejected Judge Sweets reasoning, saying that since DNA is a chemical, the chemical structure is what matters and that informational content is irrelevant to that fact.</i><p>This paragraph is the most troubling to me.  In the most obvious definition of the terms, the informational content and the chemical structure of DNA are two different ways of saying the same thing.  It would be like saying, ""the shape of the splotches of ink on this paper are what's being patented, and the informational content is irrelevant""",1312051940

2826361,comment,2824646,2826075,1,0,Cushman,,,"I don't think I buy that the idea of ""total amount of suffering"" makes sense. That suggests that a world with more people, who are each suffering less, would be a worse world overall by virtue of having more ""total"" suffering. That strikes me as strongly counterintuitive, and very hard to justify rationally, though I'd be happy to see the attempt.<p>And in fact that seems to be the world we're living in. For example, in this TED talk[1] Steven Pinker makes the argument a person being born today anywhere in the world, counting Iraq and Darfur  has less of a chance of dying at the hands of another person than at any time before in history.<p>So I'm a little skeptical of the idea that the only way to make the human race feel better is to have less of it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violen...</a>",1312051860

2826359,comment,2826297,2826297,29,0,andrewljohnson,,,"This is a little out of hand now, and it really isn't because of anything fundamentally wrong with AirBnB. The vast majority of the issue is that AirBnB is not reacting well to the crisis, and that the PR is being handled about as clumsily as possible.<p>Y-Combinator needs a PR firm. That much is clear from the AirBnB fall out over the last few days, and I'm not talking about a PR firm to cheer lead for YC, or a PR firm to respond to this or any particular incident.<p>Instead, they need a PR firm that will evaluate risks of the evolving start-ups, in particular focusing on ones with lots of funding and press exposure. The firm's role would be to anticipate and plan for potential fall out. In times of trouble, the firm would be poised to jump in and coach the team on the appropriate way to respond to crisis in the public eye. A good PR firm would know that saying the word ""funding"" to the victim was simply not a good idea, and would have advised the founders as such before any meetings with the victim.<p>I think public relations is like a dirty word in the valley, but PR need not be an unethical or otherwise bad practice, and in this case, the right support would have made a world of difference. The firm really could just be an observer, except in times of crisis. It may be beneficial for the firm to interact with the start-ups, but I think this would at least lead to resistance, given the culture of technical-centric organizations. Simply having an impartial observer with a nose for media problems would avert some crises.",1312051833

2826350,comment,2825164,2825766,9,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"I'm a long-time game programmer, and not at all an Apple fan (somewhat the opposite, in fact). When I picked up Android I really, really wanted to like it.<p>Every time I turned around, the Android platform surprised me. In a bad way. Full disclosure: I'm also not a Java fan, and think it was a completely brain-dead idea to make Java the first-class API. I'm certainly not a Microsoft fan, but even C#/Mono would have been better (not that I know any C#), if only so they wouldn't have had to waste time reimplementing the VM for licensing reasons. But it's not Java that I had a hard time with.<p>I've developed games on 12 different hardware/software platforms. There are so many things missing and/or broken about the way Android does things that I feel embarrassed for Google. Some of those things have subsequently been fixed, but many haven't, and some have been ignored in the bug database for YEARS now. A LOT of those things wouldn't have been problems if they didn't have so many layers between the app and the hardware (Java being one of those layers, but not the only problem).<p>As you say, it's really Not That Hard to just throw a simple app together that does what it needs to. Intents and Services are also ABSOLUTELY not the problem. The developer who wrote the original article didn't read enough of the docs or the right docs, or isn't as smart as he thinks he is -- the concept of Intents is not rocket science. The application lifecycle isn't even hard to understand -- it's laid out in the intro docs pretty clearly.<p>If only Android actually DID what those docs said, things would be a lot easier for a game developer. In fact, an ""app"" can be stopped and then a new one started before the old one actually receives its shut-down message. In the same (Linux) process -- so any native code with static data is still sitting around. One of many annoying problems I ran into.<p>I think the core mistake of almost every new platform is one of ego. ""We'll design this NEW AND DIFFERENT platform in some revolutionary and awesome way, and make everyone rewrite their apps in this way feel is Better."" When dealing with platforms, the one most important thing to do, in my opinion, is to HIDE the differences between one and another platform as much as possible. Android does this to some degree WITHIN the Android ecosystem, but we simply DON'T NEED multiple ecosystems. I submit it would be better for everyone if there were a single cross-platform engine that everyone used. Before I get dismissed as a kook, please think about OpenGL, and the fact that something as complex as a rendering subsystem IS in fact supported on all platforms, to everyone's benefit.<p>What would have been better is a library that abstracts away the fact that Android is its own unique OS, period. When I write code, I don't want it to be Android code, or iOS code, or WebOS code, or Windows [Mobile] code, or Linux code. I want it to be, as much as possible, completely cross-platform. I want the platform to fade into the background. You could bootstrap this by creating all the UI and other OS code as a portable layer that can run on many different systems.<p>But no new platform developer ever seems to get that, and so we end up with a new ecosystem for every new platform, and it's left to third parties to fill in the gap with cross-platform libraries. But it's not the developers -- or the users -- that big initiatives like Android get funded to satisfy.<p>/rant",1312051534

</code></pre>
For your ""reflection, refraction, dispersion, etc."", in principle the 'system' from each transmitter to each receiver is both time invariant and linear which means that can account for the effects of ""reflection, refraction, dispersion, etc."" just by applying a 'transfer function' (below).  Yes, need a different transfer function for each pair of transmitter and receiver.  Apparently the 'test data' that is sent is to determine the transfer functions.<p>""Signal""?  A 'signal' is just a real valued function of the real variable time.  So, say that for time t s(t) is such a signal.  To keep this simple but still powerful enough for practice, suppose time t is in only a finite interval.  In this real problem the length of the interval is likely a small fraction of one second.<p>""Time invariant""?  Over an interval short enough that physical movement, the weather, birds, etc. don't significantly change the situation.  In this real problem, we may be asking that the system remain time invariant only over a small fraction of a second.<p>""Linear"":  If send through signal x and receive signal r(x) and send through signal y and receive signal r(y), then for numbers a and b when send through signal ax + by receive signal ar(x) + br(y). Such linearity should hold even with lots of ""reflection, refraction, dispersion, etc."".<p>So this linearity is just another example of classic 'linearity' that math is awash in from linear transformations in linear algebra, linearity of differentiation and integration in calculus, 'linear operators' as in much of mathematical physics, much of 'functional analysis' with Hilbert and Banach spaces, the various 'representation' theorems for linear operators, etc.  Or, as in G. Simmons, the twin pillars of mathematical analysis are linearity and continuity.<p>""Transfer function""?  Suppose we send signal u(t) and receive signal s(t). Take the Fourier transform of signal u(t).  That is, convert u(t) to its 'frequencies'.  If u(t) is a sound from one key on an organ, then the Fourier transform gives essentially just the sine waves at the various 'overtones' of the organ note.  We are good at understanding such overtones if only because the human ear does some work close to Fourier transforms.  Say that the Fourier transform of u(t) is U(w) for frequencies w.  Or, U(w) is is the 'spectrum' of u(t).<p>Now, for our time invariant linear system, say that its 'transfer function' is H(w) for frequencies w.  Say that the signal that is received is s(t) with Fourier transform S(w).  Okay, presto, for each frequency w,<p><pre><code>     S(w) = H(w) U(w).
</code></pre>
That is, at each frequency, just multiply the input U(w) by the the value of the transfer function H(w) at frequency w and get the output S(w).<p>Then the final signal received s(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of S(w). Cute.  Signals in electronic engineering are just awash in this relationship.<p>The context of Shannon's theorem is quite different from that of DIDO.  If want to compare with Shannon's theorem, then DIDO raises an issue because as the number of transmitters and receivers and total 'bandwidth' increase, the total transmitted power will have to increase, but a big point of Shannon's work was that the power is limited.  That is, Shannon understood that could push through all the data wanted if could just increase power arbitrarily.<p>Another big point in Shannon's work was 'noise' on the communications channel.  Again, in principle, with no noise, can push through all the data you want even with limited power.<p>So, here's Shannon's work in a nutshell as I remember it from years ago without review (take with a shovel full of salt):  As I did in<p><pre><code>     http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2820131
</code></pre>
consider the problem over a finite interval of time and convert to discrete points in time and in frequency.  Are told the maximum power can send.  And as the signal travels, a 'noise' signal gets added.<p>Due to the finite power, all the signals can send are in just a sphere (in a finite dimensional space of appropriate dimension).  Then due to the noise, what is received is the signal sent plus the noise.  So, in effect, due to the added noise, what is received is a point in a (small) sphere around the signal that would have been received without the noise.<p>So, all the signals that can be received are in a big sphere determined by the power.  And each signal that is received is in a small sphere of its own inside the big sphere.<p>But want the separate signals to be distinguishable.  So, for any two signals sent, want their small spheres at the receiver not to overlap.  So, the number of different signals that can be sent is the number of small spheres that will fit, without overlap, inside the big sphere at the receiver.<p>So, net, we're talking about the number of little balls that will fit inside a big ball.<p>Basically that's it.<p>Likely more details are in<p><pre><code>     http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf</code></pre>",1312050657

To treat this case like it is an isolated, unique event, is also ridiculous. AirBnB might be tremendously safe. But so is flying, and people have irrational fears of flying because the odd disaster happens. Airlines have entire disaster teams in place to handle these rare events.<p>Honestly, I think a big problem here is that you have men handling a situation in which they were completely oblivious to the feelings of their customer. Men can't possibly appreciate the sense of vulnerability most women have walking down the street alone at night, let alone the sense of violation that occurs from events like this. What the woman in question implied in her blog post was anger that the men were cold and not paying attention to her <i>feelings</i>. My advice would be to find a woman with great customer service experience and give her authority to personally handle this situation, in-person.<p>That would take care of the immediate problem. Long term, AirBnB needs to develop a strategy for handling these sort of cases. Reports of insurance being offered is a good first step. But they need to think about having disaster teams in place similar to the ones airlines and insurance companies have. They are in the same boat as these companies; when something goes wrong, it goes very very wrong.

He says companies are desperate to hire talent (not true) and then gives three examples of perks, the first two of which are prostitution and gambling, both of which are done as one-off events, and neither of which are perks in any reasonable interpretation of the concept.<p>The third example, of entrepreneurship classes, is not unreasonable, but even better than that would be dropping the clauses on contracts that seize ownership of everything employees do on side projects in their own time using their own equipment, as well as the insane and common contract clauses claiming ownership of work done for so many months after ones leaves. I doubt that is going to happen any time soon, that seems to be a sacred clause to many companies. So instead they offer entrepreneurship classes, with the obvious understanding that should you actually act on them and start a side project you will be sued into oblivion.",1312049376

Hundreds of models, probably thousands of files (not including plugins and gems) across the whole app. They are experiencing scaling issues but not for requests per second, but for developer productivity.<p>I'm reading a great book called Service-Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails, by Paul Dix. He states a lot of the issues that our team is running into with a monolithic app. Seems also that these issues can apply to other frameworks outside of Rails (I've run into some of these same issues years ago with Java web apps).<p>The main point of the book is figuring out how to abstract out various layers of the app into standalone services. I've talked to people about this and a lot of the time they recoil at the fact that you would increase the complexity of the app by adding yet more parts (services) that require separate machines, deployment dependencies, and their own data stores. However, looking at big sites like Amazon or Twitter shows how one needs and can break apart their systems to make it easier for developers to focus on particular pieces as well as increase system performance.<p>I'm going to be joining a new startup this year as the technology lead and all these things are on the table. I'm evaluating node, some NoSQL dbs, some cloud paas', etc. I'm also going to be designing from the beginning fast fail and services - or at least an architecture that makes it fairly easy to start migrating parts of the system over to their own standalone services should the need arise. I don't think you can plan for everything, but with the way technology is moving forward and the tools available today, you need to keep SOA at least in the back of your mind.",1312049136

She said the communication was very frequent and emotionally reassuring before the 30th. After the 30th  about when she wrote her 1st blog post  it was more 'occasional' with a cofounder.<p>Lots of people (including the parent and grandparent post here) have been treating this as a 'cutoff'. That's how EJ <i>felt</i>. That feeling comes across in how she chose to describe everything, but the real message she's sending is that <i>she stopped liking the communication after June 30th</i>, not that it ended.<p>My theory is that's because some initially empathetic support people were replaced with a 'just-the-facts' cofounder. Let's say he's trying to help by concentrating on the tangibles  do you have a place to stay? ok. is the perp caught? ok. will you call if you need anything? ok. is there any way we can twist this ending for you so you wrap things up on your blog more positively so people know AirBnb helped? er...<p>That style of communication could rub a still-stressed victim the wrong way. And a request like the last one could have been intended as a way of asking, ""how do we help you so much that you can balance the fear and anger of your June 29th post with something better in an update?""... but instead be misinterpreted as untoward pressure.<p>That's just a theory, but it's a better theory than the one that AirBnb are jerks, or the false idea (based on various misreadings of EJ) that <i>no offer of financial support</i> was made and <i>no communication happened for weeks</i>. EJ's own posts refute those ideas.<p>When dealing with contentious, emotionally-charged situations, <i>give everyone involved the benefit of the doubt</i>.",1312049101

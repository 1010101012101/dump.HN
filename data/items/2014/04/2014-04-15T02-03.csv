Because if you did, you&#x27;d have been wrong. Plus, among the set of technologies/companies that are discussed on HN, not that many are directly related to the goals you mentioned.<p>Perhaps Bitcoin is wasteful due to its Proof-of-Work system but you have to consider how wasteful the alternative is. How much human capital is wasted in operating the deposit banking and payments industry? How much land and resources are wasted to physically secure cash in bank vaults and move it around? How much efficiency is lost to high transaction fees or lack of access to the banking system? How many services which haven&#x27;t yet been invented would be enabled by a distributed ledger? I&#x27;m not saying Bitcoin would wipe out those industries completely but it could certainly make parts of them obsolete.<p>I think it&#x27;s wrong to dismiss the technology just because you dislike its community.

7590098,comment,7586225,7587152,1,0,kijin,,,"Here&#x27;s an idea that I&#x27;ve been toying with for several months now.<p>Many modern laptops have an mSATA port in addition to a regular 2.5&quot; SATA hard drive. If you install a tiny SSD in the mSATA port and move your OS to the SSD, you can enjoy the speed of SSD without giving up the capacity of the hard drive.<p>But what if you installed a <i>large</i> (480GB or 960GB) SSD in the mSATA port and used it for all of your storage needs? Then the regular hard drive becomes completely redundant. But TSA agents are not known for their tech savvy, so most of them will not realize that you&#x27;re not even using the regular hard drive.<p>So put a decoy OS on the regular hard drive, with no encryption whatsoever. All the encrypted stuff goes on the mSATA SSD instead. Prior to the trip, configure your BIOS to boot from the regular hard drive, and dislocate the mSATA SSD just a couple of millimeters in its slot so that it&#x27;s not even recognized. When the agent boots the laptop, all he&#x27;s going to see is a clean OS that takes up the entire hard drive, and even if he takes a disk image, there will be nothing suspicious on it.<p>Now you only need to make up some story along the lines of your computer crashed last week and you had Geeksquad reformat it but you didn&#x27;t have time to copy all your family photos back from the external drive at home.<p>Well, now that I&#x27;ve spilled the beans on HN, they&#x27;ll probably try to pull my mSATA SSD the next time I try to enter the US.

Toyota isn&#x27;t going to start replacing robots with humans, but the humans need an in depth understanding of what the robots are doing, so they can then improve what the robots are doing.  The best way to learn what the robots are doing is to do it: get in there and watch how the metal flows, how it reacts to heat and so on.<p>This has the potential to be an engineer&#x27;s utopia.

The original comment included &quot;proprietary codecs vs vp8&quot; on a list of positive things Mozilla has done, which also included other implementation-specific things like &quot;javascript performance&quot;.<p>>Unless Mozilla are advocating that everybody use a specific implementation of VP8, but that would be hugely hypocritical and inconsistent after their war against WebDB/SQLite.<p>Mozilla is, in their own browser, using a codec (read as: implementation) which isn&#x27;t proprietary. This has two positive effects: it keeps Firefox from becoming proprietary; and it also helps push other browsers to implement the same video format (either using the same codec or not), which helps increase the format&#x27;s marketshare, meaning that more videos on the Web can be viewed using a non-proprietary codec (implementation).<p>>In a world of submarine patents and patent trolls your definition of proprietary is meaningless because any software could become proprietary at any time when a previously unknown or unenforced patent starts being enforced.<p>It&#x27;s not meaningless, it&#x27;s just somewhat fuzzy. I think you&#x27;re committing the continuum fallacy here. A piece of software which I can only use if I pay the patent owner a million dollars is clearly proprietary. A piece of software which is more than 20 years old is clearly not proprietary (unless it&#x27;s proprietary for copyright reasons), since any patents would have expired. In between are some gray areas, but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate the overall concept. As a practical matter, it&#x27;s useful to only consider software proprietary on patent grounds if there is a specific patent holder who has asserted a specific patent against it.<p>>Additionally, it&#x27;s a definition that is very location specific - many of these software patents are not valid or recognised in most of the world. I don&#x27;t have much interest in the US legal system being forced upon me by people obsessed with US patent law when I&#x27;m not a US citizen or resident.<p>So, you think it doesn&#x27;t matter if people in the US can&#x27;t see videos on the Web without paying for a patent license as long as it doesn&#x27;t affect you directly?<p>>Nokia have actively brought cases against HTC over some of those patents.<p>Wikipedia mentions that a German court ruled against Nokia.",1397530180

I went through about five digital form contracts, and when I got to the last one, it had the clause in there. I told the woman that I wanted to amend the contract and she huffed and told me they don&#x27;t do that. I replied that I was promised that I would not have to agree to such a clause, and she told me that it was mandatory, so I could take it or leave it. I asked if there was anyone in HR I could talk to about this, and was told no. So I stood up and said &quot;please escort me out the door, starting immediately I am resigning. At the gate, I would like the security guard to search my things.&quot; (it was a secured facility, and I didn&#x27;t want anyone to claim I was stealing anything later.) She asked me if I was serious, and I said yes. I was berated for how much time and money was wasted on getting me ready for employment, and I replied I was promised repeatedly that I would not have to sign away my rights, and this was absolutely a deal breaker and I didn&#x27;t appreciate being told repeatedly this would be honored until the very last minute. So really, my time was being wasted too. This really, really didn&#x27;t go over well. My heart was beating like crazy the entire time. My former boss was furious, the HR person was furious. The security guard was cool about it though.",1397529703

There&#x27;s no multi-gear transmission, and while there are moving parts, and other than the wheels/brakes, they aren&#x27;t bathed in liquids that need regular changes and they aren&#x27;t subjected to combustion and various other destructive forces that an ICE is constantly subjected to. There&#x27;s relatively little force transmission hardware needed. The motors themselves should be relatively low-friction, and mechanically are much, much simpler than internal combustion engines (compare a breakdown of the parts of an ICE vs. electric motor, they&#x27;re in completely different leagues). Air-fuel mixture control, turbochargers, and all manner of other chemical energy management systems are replaced by solid state electronics.",1397528183

This means you need as much data validation and associated business logic offline in your app to prevent the user from even saving wrong data in the first place.<p>Some customers will <i>want</i> their users to work disconnected during their whole work day to save on data costs. Again, think global, data plans are not the same between the US and Brazil, for example.<p>Even if permitted to work online, the work environment the user enters might prevent them from going online. Think hospitals, where mobile phone usage is restricted in certain areas or is simply blocked through an active MRI machine in the vicinity.<p>The amount of data needed locally will likely be higher than in consumer apps.<p>A fully offline capable model to ensure maximum independence of connectivity needs a mix of sync mechanisms that should follow their respective business use cases. Conflict resolution and error handling is not exactly simple in such an environment, pervasive logging is key - plus a way to sync down app logs to the online backend. Users can freely fiddle with time/date and locale settings on iOS devices for example, which can wreak havoc on your sync logic - being able to backtrack such events is key when dealing with customer support issues.",1397528062

Ironically, the happiness index in women is down in Western societies whereas the same measure for men, is up! And we can hardly argue that women are treated as less equal than they were in the 70s.<p>People have a knee jerk reaction and say &quot;oh yeah, that&#x27;s because women have to do even more work now&quot; where that isn&#x27;t actually the case. Married women with traditional gender roles are actually happier than their married and equal counterparts.<p>Now, I know I&#x27;m not providing any statistics or references but I would urge you to be on the lookout. They show up quite regularly and are easy to find once you are open to the concept. One good place to start is &quot;Brainwash&quot;, a &quot;documentary&quot; by a comedian that actually resulted in a loss of funds to a gender studies institute.<p>All this being said, I do not think a single one of us would say that a woman should not be encouraged to be a programmer.

7589961,comment,7589744,7589744,3,0,11thEarlOfMar,,,"My startup is compensating the engineers with restricted shares in the corporation. When we go for funding, we will want the highest valuation we can convince the investors of. One important valuation attribute is the corporation&#x27;s legal ownership of the intellectual property produced by the engineers who build the system. That intellectual property is not just patents, but the source code, web site design, system architecture, operating processes and many other points. Basically, the intellectual property is what ever the engineers create in the process of building the startup.<p>The restricted shares are granted under contractor agreements. Performing to those agreements qualifies the restrictions on the shares to be lifted, in effect vesting the the shares.<p>In order for the corporation to demonstrate that it has legal ownership of everything the engineers have created, the contractor agreement they sign is very explicit and verbose [1] about their informed decision to turn over ownership of that IP to the company, and that the ownership they are being given in the company is compensation for the intellectual property they produce. The language specifically carves out -relevance- to the startup: &quot;... that are related to the business (present or future) of the Company or its affiliates...&quot;.<p>None of them have any qualm about this, and fully understand the purpose and value of turning over their creative fruits to the company.<p>I&#x27;d expect that this principle has to persist regardless of the size of the company. The key to making it work is that the employee/inventor willfully signs up to the legal restrictions the company places on them as payment for their work and compensation for their creativity. I can easily imagine that corporate attorneys who work to protect their employer&#x27;s interests would push the lines of what constitutes the scope of the company&#x27;s claim over their work. I&#x27;d guess that for every term that seems intrusive or abusive, there is a precedent case somewhere that corporations can point to as justification for it.<p>In the case of my startup, the language is specific that the invention is made in the course of building the company, not from other unrelated activities.<p>[1] INVENTIONS.\n(a)  Disclosure.   I will promptly disclose In writing to the Company all discoveries, developments, designs, ideas, improvements, inventions, formulas, processes, techniques, know-how, and data (whether or not patentable or registerable under copyright or similar statutes) made, conceived, reduced to practice, or learned by me (either alone or jointly with others) during the term of the Independent Contractor Agreement between the Company  and me and within 12 months thereafter (unless any such disclosure Is prohibited by the terms of a commercially reasonable non-disclosure agreement signed by me that Is meant to protect the trade secrets and confidentiality of an employer subsequently employing me), that are related to the business (present or future) of the Company or its affiliates, or which result from tasks assigned to me by the Company, or from the use of facilities or equipment owned, leased, or otherwise used by the Company or Its affiliates (all of the foregoing  are referred to in this Agreement as &quot;Inventions&quot;). \n(b)  Assignment of Inventions.

It is absolutely absurd that a company feels entitled to my personal work because of &quot;maybe.&quot;</i><p>Organizations tend toward pessimism because people respond more strongly to shame, insult, and embarrassment (of themselves and others) than to victory, pride, altruism, and shared glory. They turn toward a certain paranoia. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so much HR literature on how to conduct &quot;low performer&quot; witch hunts (get those time thieves!) while companies don&#x27;t do the least thing to support high performers (except offer them more money when they seem likely to leave).<p>Ultimately, most things controlled by humans devolve into feudalistic, dysfunctional reputation economies in which the trade of social credibility becomes the only thing that matters, and the organization&#x27;s original purpose is either forgotten, ignored, or half-assed. There are counterexamples and exceptions and processes that prevent this, but they&#x27;re uncommon. Most companies have much fear of the humiliation of &quot;that guy&quot; stealing time to launch his own career, and only a slight background hum (if even that, as sometimes it&#x27;s dead silence) of fear for the real existential threats: crumbling morale, widespread distrust, and the death of innovation.",1397527586

Linux tries to support so many architectures and has a main frame operating system, that it&#x27;s too complex. LoseThos is way way way simpler. Plus it has many innovative ideas. It is not ASCII source code, for example.</i>",1397527297

I don&#x27;t give a shit what a company says about their culture of work/life balance or whatever. If I see blanket IP clauses unrelated to non-compete, or like arbitration clauses that remove us from civil courts should a problem arise, I&#x27;m whistling on my way out the door.<p>I once saw a contract that stated I couldn&#x27;t work in the field for TWO YEARS after terminating. Not just large machine equipment, but ANY mobile/web applications, related to integration with embedded systems or not. Yeah no thanks.<p>Your mind should be available for rent for $100k/year or whatever your market rate is these days but not for sale at that price. Sorry but I&#x27;m a Human as a Service. If you want to own me, you&#x27;ll have to come to a better valuation.",1397527279

But in Germany, as in many other countries: If it goes to court, you will loose against a big company.<p>It was an other situation, but a lawyer once told me, what happens when such things go to court: The corporation will bring 10 witnesses against you and will bring 10 experts certifying what the corporation needs.<p>And than you will be very alone and be gracious to get even a little money. You will loose your job anyway.",1397527220

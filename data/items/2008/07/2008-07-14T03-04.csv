They're a pain to install, customize, develop for, maintain, intergrate, and scale.  If there ever was a software idea that reeked of enterprisey-ness, this is one of them.",1216007977

245475,comment,245357,245382,0,0,snewe,,,"This low probability of an accident actually happening suggests that the condition probabilities presented in the article have huge standard errors.  This may make the differences between sections of the plane insignificant.  Then again, there aren't standard errors per se because we should have the population of all accidents rather than a sample. Interesting....",1216007091

245473,comment,245441,245441,0,0,ALee,,,"I think the idea of a “minimum valid test” is really what you should be aiming for.<p>There should be a private phase for usability and to see whether that question can accurately be tested. Your goal is to make sure that your terrible site design or code or whatever does not get in the way of the test.<p>Then there should be a scaling phase, some call beta. You can create scarcity by doing beta password signups to make sure that your servers aren't causing users to not enjoy the site (why is it so slow?!).<p>Then, I think it's the public phase, where you let anyone come to your site.<p>Really, if you have courage and trust in your abilities. going straight to public is the best option because it causes you to iterate quickly.",1216006828

They have a couple great graphics that really fill in some of the blanks.<p>But, more than all of the great tech, you have a team of people that are passionate about what they do, which is to keep your app up and running while you're on the beach.<p>Alright so maybe you're not on the beach but the point is that if you have a complex, mission-critical app, you can outsource your hosting and support to them.  If you compare how much EY charges to what you'd pay for your own employees to do the same, not to mention the hardware, you'll find the cost of EY is pretty darn cheap.<p>$.02 from a longtime EY watcher and future customer.",1216004944

I value usability above almost everything because it allows your users to get from point A to B in the most effective way possible.<p>At the end of the day thats all that really matters, especially when 90% of internet users couldn't tell a bad design (graphically) from a good design.<p>One of the best ways I found to approach this is to design with HTML in mind at every step. Photoshop really makes you lose focus and end up perfecting the layout and not the presentation of the content.",1216004900

Even in places that don&#x27;t enforce extra long hours you often feel pressured to arrive early and stay late.<p>Not my experience, working in several London tech companies.<p>> Didn&#x27;t Steve Jobs have his own uniform (turtle neck, jeans, trainers)? Even places that don&#x27;t require a suit usually have some sort of dress code (jeans, shirt). In a small startup you will have to meet investors or potential customers and in these situations it&#x27;s required to look at least respectable. It sucks but appearances matter.<p>Only one of those tech companies I worked for enforced a dress code. It was the one that went bankrupt. I don&#x27;t think this is coincidence.",1411304049

I know a dentist who told me that she rejects evidence based medicine and thinks that we should use traditional Chinese medicine instead. She isn&#x27;t Chinese, she is a British middle-class hippy and when I asked her about the effect on rare species, she said that rare species are never used in Chinese medicine. I then asked her if she supports evidence based medicine when her patients are anesthetized, or does she think the dosage should be guessed and she said she didn&#x27;t know what that had to do with it. Also, 5 is a tiny sample. From a sample of 5 dentists, 4 might tell you that the second coming of Christ is imminent, but that would tell you very little about either Christ&#x27;s travel plans, or the opinions of dentists.",1411304024

Plus: the word &#x27;homoiconic&#x27; does not really fit well.<p>In Lisp we talk about that code is data, other than a string.<p>Thus we can construct programs by constructing data using the usual primitive data structure functions:<p><pre><code>    ? (list &#x27;+ 1 2)\n    (+ 1 2)\n</code></pre>\nNote that Lisp does not use any special purpose data-structures for code. Nothing like special constructors for AST data structures. One does NOT have to call a MAKE-FUNCTION-CALL procedure. Lisp also does not need to construct programs as strings, where I would have to parse the language with string/stream operations to access individual elements of the program. A number 2 would be represented as text, not as numeric data as in Lisp.<p>Above is a valid program and it is a list of three elements. There are no strings involved. + is a symbol and 1 and 2 are actually real numbers.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the 1:<p><pre><code>    ? (describe (second (list &#x27;+ 1 2)))\n    Fixnum: 1\n</code></pre>\nThe interface to executing code is the function EVAL. It takes code as data, and not a string.<p><pre><code>    ?

When you do this, it&#x27;s customary to attempt to support your position with arguments. :)<p>An only-somewhat-related anecdot. I remember sitting in the car with my sister and mother when I was young. My sister was learning to write. On this day, she asked what a fictitious word meant. She showed us a word she had written down, and then said it out loud. We didn&#x27;t know what she meant. But we worked out that was playing with an idea: does the fact that we can use the tools to represent an idea (in this case, that you can form apparently words from letters) mean that it maps to an idea. As it happens, no.",1411301760
8346957,comment,8346642,8346642,2,0,sheng,,,"All the whining and complaining makes me wondering how anyone was able to write something with OpenGL at all.  This is fascinating because a great amount of people were actually able to write awesome Games and Applications with this API.<p>Look at the whole lot of mobile devices.  I have no numbers to base this statement on but I would be bold enough to claim that OpenGL is thanks to the multiplatform ability by far the most successful graphics API out there.  The set of devices that brings some or another form of OpenGL support outnumbers other graphics platforms.  This alone is a huge accomplishment.  Heck, even Minecraft was able to run on PowerPC systems until they pushed the java version supported[1].<p>But now I need to look at the link and have to admit that the criticism is still correct.  The API is still pretty rough and could see some improvements.  I know this myself, I also played around with OpenGL at some point.  There is a lot of boilerplate code that needs to be written before you can start yourself with the real game.  This was always the case.  This is why we always had an engine, a framework to built on.<p>But to say that it all is a huge pile of shit is a little bit harsh …<p>[1] <a href=""https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/884921-minecraft-java-5-and-powerpc-support"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/884921-mine...</a>",1411301715

So basically, you need to find more people like you (or rather your co-founding developers) that are in need for such a solution. Where do these people &quot;hang around&quot;? Where are they looking for help with their work, where would they look for such a tool? How can you get in touch with them?&quot;<p>We&#x27;re thinking to start in stackoverflow and unity forums, and try to figure out other sites and forums. Challenge is that we don&#x27;t really post or have accounts there so we&#x27;re starting from scratch and concern about being spammy?<p>&quot;Contacting developers directly would be one of my first ideas, too. How many developers did you contact? Did you get any feedback at all? Did you add tracking to your mails so that you can estimate open/click rates? Maybe you need to improve your cold pitch mail...&quot;<p>We got pretty low click rates, about 5% and then low conversion on the homepage.  We guess that they just get bombarded with so many messages from ad networks etc the tendency is to delete everything?<p>&quot;Are there any conferences or game development meetups in your area where you could spread the word about your service?&quot;<p>We&#x27;re in Hong Kong and no travel budget, so not really :(<p>&quot;Did you think about performance marketing, e.g. AdWords?&quot;<p>I checked out the rates, seems really too expensive for adwords, maybe the VC backed ad and analytic companies are pushing up the keywords for everyone.

However, remember that the average seed investment in Europe in 2013 was $150,000 compared with $500,000 in the U.S.<p>><p>> We suspect that the reduced time between rounds in Europe unfortunately signals that entrepreneurs are being forced to refocus on fundraising more quickly at the expense of building and scaling a product and the business.<p>I believe this is true, my own anecdotal experience backs it up. We&#x27;re a London based startup ( <a href=""https://microco.sm/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://microco.sm/</a> ) and we raised our initial £150k for our friends and family round which enabled us to build the platform and get to 43,500 users.<p>But... we&#x27;re now in a tough spot with the runway end looming, and have to return to fundraising. I&#x27;d much rather carry on focusing on the product development and improving awareness of our offering. But instead it&#x27;s a drop-everything and go focus on raising money... which in-turn kills a little of our momentum.<p>It feels like the European adversity to risk manifests as smaller investments that result in the startups not having as much time to mature their offering and build that momentum before constantly going back for more investment.",1411301293

With bitcoin, there seems to be no recourse when the exchanges get hit. This is not to mention that you are much better protected with a credit card due to the ability to contest a merchant charge if things go sour (you didn&#x27;t get the product, it was defective, etc.) not to mention other benefits of credit.",1386619199

Then they will send over who ever is available on the bench for the projects that the skilled person interviewed for, whether they sat for the interview with the client or not.<p>If you know what to look for, these types of individuals are really easy to spot.

Well, a street vendor in UK starts accepting Bitcoin for burgers and price jumps above $1,000 in excitement (I&#x27;m kidding, of course). Talking about overreaction! Let&#x27;s see some real commerce numbers, not marketing tricks to get more news coverage. I got tired of seeing everywhere in the news that one Florida guy bought a Tesla in California! With such volatility, you need to put a huge buffer in your pricing and only idiots and criminals will spend their BTC instead of paying with fiat in such case. There was some new about Indian business accepting Bitcoin then some Indian guy converted the price and showed Bitcoin price was x3 higher! If BTC is a currency, it should move up and down by no more than 1-2% (like a real currencies do) otherwise it cannot be used in serious commerce, period. At this point, Bitcoin, unfortunately, is a speculators tool. And if you invest in Bitcoin, don&#x27;t forget, you&#x27;re in the hands of the Chinese investors (kings of the panic sells) and the governments. Also, there are many fake news and incorrect interpretations of news about Bitcoin. Like some putting the wrong wording in Al Gore&#x27;s mouth about Bitcoin when he meant something totally different or Snoop Dogg making a joke and people taking it seriously.<p>If Bitcoin dropped 40% due to overreaction to no-so-bad news, imagine what will happen when really bad news come out!<p>I believe in Bitcoin, but I cannot tolerate the madness around the price. Even if you use it as a speculator, your future medical bills will not be able to cover the profit you&#x27;re gonna make - with such huge swings, the stress is way too much for the profits. Just try to imagine the Winklevoss seeing BTC dropping by 40% and tens of millions of their imaginary wealth disappearing in minutes! It&#x27;s better to do margin trading with Forex - you can make even more with less stress. So, speculators, please, leave the Bitcoin land and move to Litecoin or other speculator playgrounds.

No. The other ISP just rent less bandwidth than they&#x27;d really need, so they can&#x27;t offer a decent service (during peak hour it&#x27;s very easy to get less speed than what you&#x27;d get with a 56k).<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that we don&#x27;t have a cable network too, so we&#x27;re stuck with the phone one.

It&#x27;s possible to ask the converse question: what happens when everyone has a low-paying job?<p>The answer is that deflation must occur. Home prices must fall, etc.<p>The problem is that deflation is incredibly painful, more painful than inflation. Activist labor is highly inflationary, which in today&#x27;s debt-overburdened environment is exactly what we (meaning about 99.5% of the population) need.<p>You can make shoulda-coulda-woulda arguments about how we got ourselves into this mess with too much debt, but there&#x27;s two problems with that. The first is the pragmatic fact that <i>we are here</i> and that populist-driven inflation is the least painful way out. The second is a bit deeper. One thing that&#x27;s becoming clear from history is that &quot;trickle down&quot; economics does not work. Money does trickle down, but it trickles down in the form of debt. Why engage in entrepreneurial ventures or pay higher salaries when you can lend money at interest with less work required on your end and more assurance of repayment? There&#x27;s a direct balance sheet correlation between the rich getting richer and everyone else going deeper into debt, since the savings of the rich become the debt of everyone else.<p>I am not, by the way, advocating &quot;socialism&quot; in any dogmatic sense. That IMHO is another discredited dogma. I am advocating pragmatism in lieu of a better idea, since I think all political dogmas are discredited at this point. If you don&#x27;t have a systematic approach to solving a problem, the only choice you have is between winging it and doing nothing. Doing nothing here will lead back to feudalism.<p>Edit: one more point: Silicon Valley folks have a distorted picture of the rich. California&#x27;s neuvo riche tech elite are <i>not</i> in the mainstream for their class. In short, your rich people are better than everyone else&#x27;s rich people.<p>The mere existence of folks like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos shows by virtue of comparison that the vast majority of their socioeconomic contemporaries are merely lucky gamblers who have rationalized their ascent as meritocratic via survivorship bias. If being in the 1% were truly meritocratic we would have a ton of Elon Musks launching a ton of world-changing ventures all the time. Instead we have a bunch of mediocre rich people putting their money in dumb Wall St. funds that do nothing with it but buy government bonds or create more debt (and me-too herd-driven bubbles) for the masses.<p>Heh...

If I can save someone else&#x27;s child from suffering what my child had to suffer, it&#x27;s worth it.<p>> Was language a contributing factor?<p>No.<p>First, this was several years ago, before the latest government went all crazy with the French language and French language police.  It&#x27;s worse now, but back than, it wasn&#x27;t as bad.<p>Second, we lived and would have received services in Montreal.<p>Thirdly, we never prioritized English.  My wife speaks French just fine, and we didn&#x27;t care if it the service was in English or French.<p>Fourth, it was a result of regulations by the government saying that early intervention for children with Autism is not crucial.  This was explained to us many times.  This rule flies in the face of every doctor.  Early intervention for children with autism is key.<p>Fifth, for the amount of money I was paying in taxes, I found it evil the amount that was being given to police the french language over Autism assistance.  I will not ever stand to support that province again in any way, and have no qualms about fucking it over every chance I get.<p>Sixth, we were told on more than one occasion we should give up our son to a state run home.  Now, this is the part that really gets people, and I&#x27;d love to say I was lying.  I realize this isn&#x27;t official policy, but still.  It&#x27;s the mentality.  From what I&#x27;m told by others working up there in the medical field, this isn&#x27;t uncommon for the French.<p>Anyways, that&#x27;s more information than I intended to share, but point is, we did everything in our power.  My wife worked this full time, submitting paperwork to every possible location to the point where our primary physician told us to stop sending out letters because she was tired of getting requests for information.<p>The straw that broke our back was being informed that we had finally gotten an appointment after 6 months of waiting, and we scheduled that appointment (which would take place 6 months later, mind you).  This was with an service that our doctor from one of the children&#x27;s hospitals in Montreal had recommended to us for our son.  We got this appointment in the sprint of 2011, and we were finally happy that we were moving forward.  That afternoon, we got a call back from the agency, and they cancelled the appointment, because they don&#x27;t take children with autism.  One moment we were happy!  The next, horrified that all that work was for nothing.  Over a year, and we had nothing to show for it, and our son was almost 2 1/2.  Luckily, I am American, and we made the decision to move that day.<p>So yeah, I have a deep seeded hatred for Quebec, and the Canadian Healthcare system that allowed that to happen.

It would take extensive use of brainwashing and belief in fairy tales about an enlightened government, a city on hill exceptional-ism or what-have-you to think these don&#x27;t happen. However, this level of brainwashing is achieved in US quite often. It is a lot worse vis-a-vis the rhetoric of independence, free thinking, individualism. But that in an of itself (this belief that we are no brainwashed) is also a result of brainwashing.<p>The issue is quite subtle and there are a few factors at play. One is the basic need to believe their &quot;team&quot; is a good team. This works with the brainwashing. &quot;Teams&quot;, &quot;us vs them&quot; is ingrained in our tribal brains. We want to think our team is the winning team. We are better, special, not like &quot;those others&quot;.<p>It is really working against the flow when attempting to show our citizens that &quot;yes, our country has done these horrible things to others&quot;. They is an irrational immune response against it, they have been believing their family/their team they&#x27;ve rooted for now has a dark secret, its past marred in shameful things. They have been telling others, their kids, and themselves how great our country is, and now look! -- a total reversal, &quot;what, have I been living in a fantasy world all this time?&quot; kind of bewilderment.  So instead of exposing and handling the hard truth, it is easy to bury it, stick fingers in the ears and say &quot;la-la-la, I am not hearing you, ...&quot;<p>This also is interesting because it kind of explains what happens in the brains of many who work for CIA, NSA and other such agencies. They are supposedly hired for their exceptional patriotism.  Now sometimes it backfires, because they realize what they have to do in their jobs contradicts the high idealized patriotic beliefs of what this country is about.  So there is Snowden, he is one of them. What about others?<p>There was an article just yesterday about how &quot;Morale at NSA is low after the leaks&quot;. Hmm, it is low. Why is it low?. Good to explore. Did many realize they have been playing for the bad guys all this time? Or do they just feel angry about one of their team members &quot;betraying&quot; the team and they don&#x27;t see anything wrong at all with what they do. To keep their nice govt job are they forced to believe one thing in their heads (&quot;this fucking contradicts what our Constitution is all about!&quot;),  and profess another thing at work publicly. Much like North Koreans perhaps. Cry with happiness when &quot;Dear Leader&quot; drives, but curse his guts in their head? Who knows.<p>Another way to look at it is from a psychopathic, practical aspect. Do people just acknowledge the situation for what it is and say &quot;yes we are bad and we love it&quot;. &quot;We conducted these attacks? Great! Let us do more. If it means a blowing up a few civilians so be it.&quot;  I can image many at the top operate on this principle.",1386617874

A number of years ago, a city-owned LLC called Christchurch City Networks Limited (now known as Enable Networks[1]) began rolling out an extensive fibre network in the downtown/city-centre area. Initially, for about $700 (NZD) per month, you could lease a dark pair between your premises and your ISP of choice (or even directly between two arbitrary premises, plugging directly into your own equipment at each end, with no ISP involved).<p>You&#x27;d then negotiate arbitrary speed/bandwidth/caps with your chosen ISP. We were paying something like $3000 per month for a 1000 mbit/sec internet connection with (IIRC) a 2TB cap. This was probably 8 years ago or something, it doesn&#x27;t cost anything like this now.<p>Latterly, they&#x27;ve been rolling out a GPON-based (passive) fibre network. If you are connected to this part of the network, there are highly standardised plans available from multiple ISPs. You can choose one of two speeds: 30 mbit/sec symmetric, or 100 mbit/sec symmetric. Different ISPs have different usage plans available. Any public (government-funded) school can sign up for a 30 mbit/sec plan, with unlimited traffic, for something like $200/month.<p>Amongst home users, ADSL2+ and VDSL2 are both still popular choices (and our pricing there seems similar enough to the US, with stupidly low caps and high prices), but fibre continues to gain traction.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.enable.net.nz\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.enable.net.nz</a>",1386617716

The minute you publish your method, the measure of the output&#x27;s entropy stops being relevant. Your security theoretically relies on the input&#x27;s entropy, which is likely to be much smaller.<p>But in practice, an actual attacker no longer produces brute force attacks in the blind. He actually has to model the desired target&#x27;s strategy, and produce an attack suited to that. When you are modelling your attacker, you may consider that he may consider the aforementioned method, along with any other methods his model of his intended target (which may be you, personally, or some abstract model of either you or the average X&#x27;s user, both based on demographic data) allows for.<p>For this reason, using programming language syntax instead of natural languages might be either a decent idea or a terrible idea, based on how accurate the attacker&#x27;s model of yourself will predict you are likely to do so.<p>In my personal case, given this conversation, it will be an extremely poor strategy, if I choose to model my threat model as a targeted attack (I am leaving plenty of evidence that I am likely to do something like this, on a public forum)... but if I happened to have this &#x27;my-little-pony&#x27; alter ego, not traceable to my professional persona, it would be somewhat solid strategy, (at least in the sense than few bronies are likely to choose such type of strategy).<p>And if the risk model is that of an attack on a compromised password database of thousands of not ipsec-sophisticated users, the strategy will be as good as any other for the same ((alphabet size) * (passphrase length)).",1386617227

Taking money at such a high valuation can be a serious risk because if you can not get to that $6b IPO or acquisition (in snapchat&#x27;s case I do believe that would be very difficult to pull off) you will not be in good shape.<p>These late stage investments are looked at like they are really low risk when in reality, it is always a substantial risk until you have a working business model.

Trust me, people will learn much more meaningful things about problem-solving that way. Isn&#x27;t that what writing code really sets out to do? You know, SOLVE PROBLEMS? Just code is NOT going to help that at ALL.<p>Then there&#x27;s problem number 3, and probably the largest one: it assumes that programming is something we need EVERYONE to learn. EVERYONE. Yes, that is Code.org&#x27;s goal. EVERYONE SHOULD CODE.<p>You know what, fuck it and let&#x27;s teach EVERYONE TO BE A MECHANIC. Right? Why the hell not? It&#x27;s like programming. Only that nobody in their right minds would tell people to make mechanical engineering a part of the curriculum. But people insist on doing the same for CS, as if it&#x27;s any different.<p>I could go on about this for days.

6876054,comment,6874838,6874838,8,0,rz2k,,,"Since this article is meant to be accessible to a lot of different audiences, it is difficult for me to parse what statements are just liberties being taken for the sake of an easier explanation, or whether it is arguing what I think it is arguing.<p>In a fundamental sense, the value of a share of a company&#x27;s equity is the current value of that share of future earnings (including future unknown lines of business, proceeds of liquidating assets, etc) until the end of time.<p>In order to divine the <i>expected</i> current value of future earnings is the marginal cost of a share of the company&#x27;s equity. Just as the price of the last lot of GE shares sold determines the value of GE, the value of Snapchat <i>is</i> determined by the price of the most recently sold share.<p>That does not mean that any shareholders have an accurate assessment of the value, and knowing the recent price is ~$25 does not tell us how many people would be willing to buy it for $1 or how many people would sell it for $100. Knowing the answers to the latter questions would be a step toward answering how much current shareholders could get if they all wanted out, and how much it would cost to buy every last share.<p>Since eternity takes a long time, the market&#x27;s marginal price of a share is a good proxy for the value of a company. It is the expected value according to investors with the most recent skin in the game. Anyway, that&#x27;s a long way to get to what I find really puzzling:<p>>When you look at the rumored Snapchat valuations of over 3 billion dollars, it’s difficult to understand how an investor can think that Snapchat is worth that much.  Because the truth is, it’s not. Those rumors, even if true, don’t actually value Snapchat at 3 billion dollars.  To be precise, they are bidding on a price per share of a specific series of stock.  As matter of common discourse, we multiply that number by the total number of shares outstanding and call that a valuation.  But the difference still exists and it’s important.<p>I&#x27;m parsing the middle sentence with &quot;value&quot; as a transitive verb, and the subject as actually an implied &quot;investor&quot; rather than &quot;rumor&quot;, in line with the sentences before and after. And, I find that the serious problem here is that that <i>is at least</i> the expected value according to that investor.<p>I read the rest of the explanation as a way to get at how the probability distribution around that expected value may play out, but that does not change the expected value.<p>However, to expand a little on the payouts: Suppose the disruption of Snapchat could be known to cost a competitor future revenue with a present value of exactly $3B, but the present value of all earnings of an independent Snapchat could be known to exactly equal $2B. If that competitor can buy and shutter Snapchat without any anti-trust hurdles, then in a fundamental sense the competitor would pay up to $3B for Snapchat (and the shareholders would fundamentally be willing to sell if paid more than $2B, with the market eventually awarding between $2B and $3B to the owners depending on what is negotiated).<p>In reality those numbers can not be predicted, but a valuation of $3B is a statement that the expected value is really worth $3B. An investor who pays $300M for 1%, but expects the future proceeds to be worth less than $3B is gambling that there is a sucker who has expectations that are too high, not respecting fundamentals. An investor could estimate that the earnings will be a certain amount in the hands of other management and still be in line with fundamentals, but claiming that the price will increase without producing some future cash flow or having a fundamental value to another buyer is a gamble that the market is stupid. (It&#x27;s a safe bet that the market is stupid, but the trick is knowing how stupid, in what direction, and for how long.)<p>Again, maybe I am missing something, or misunderstanding what is being said, but on the surface it is really frightening to read columns like this that appear to claim that an entire market can have a mean of valuations that are not in line with fundamentals.",1386615982

I have come to the realisation that some of these societal norms have a far more insidious effect of us than we often realise or accept. That is to say we will often judge &quot;GOOD&quot; through our own very polarised perception. Thus women are often told that if they want to succeed in business they are told that they need to act &quot;more like men&quot;, just like how black people were (are?) told that they need to act &quot;more like white people&quot;. The dominant culture creates the societal norms, but this has a negative impact on my first point because we lose the balance and discourse that comes from having a diverse organisation, so we miss an opportunity to improve the performance of our teams. To combat this there needs to be an artificial effort to challenge dominant norms and see greater diversity.<p>Finally notice how my article refers to gender equality, not Women&#x27;s Rights.

While I enjoy it most people I know would not.\nCertainly having the option to take Intro and AP CS courses (both of these are available at most public high schools) is great, but &quot;calling on all Americans,&quot; to code seems a little excessive.",1386615771

Given latitude and longitude, you can pass in a radius and create a circular region (or specify a set and create a rectangle), with callbacks that trigger when the user enters or exits that region.<p>One of the main points in the article is that it&#x27;s particularly battery intensive to update the user&#x27;s location, so there&#x27;s a trade off between accuracy and battery usage. To try and solve this, Apple created a hierarchy of accuracy constants, which range from &quot;best&quot; to three kilometers, but it&#x27;s only somewhat effective at preserving battery life.<p>The other strategy is monitoring &quot;significant changes&quot; in location, based on cell towers/wifi signals. For this, Apple provides a method called &quot;startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges&quot; if your app needs to constantly monitor the user&#x27;s location.<p>From what the article said, Foursquare is trying to improve these methods by creating probabilistic maps so they can draw better regions for each user, and therefore check for location updates less frequently. I&#x27;m assuming there are similar methods for Android.<p>Here&#x27;s the documentation for one of the main classes in Core Location called CLRegion:\n<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLRegion_class/Reference/Reference.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLo...</a>",1386615770

6876023,comment,6875151,6875865,2,0,sukuriant,,,"I think he was raging at the cyclists that don&#x27;t obey the rules of the road, not cyclists in general. I know I can separate the two out in my mind.<p>For example: when a bike is curb-hopping and ignoring stoplights, I become frustrated at their wanton disregard for their own safety. When I see a bike riding on the side of the road in their lane, focused and stopping at lights, I don&#x27;t complain and comfortably wait until there&#x27;s space for me to pass him with a wide berth and then do so.<p>It&#x27;s the same with pedestrians. I don&#x27;t get upset if they&#x27;re walking on the road. I get angry because I&#x27;m scared for their safety when they think it&#x27;s okay to j-walk across 6 lanes of traffic in rush hour at night while wearing black because &quot;I&#x27;m a pedestrian and if you hit me, I&#x27;ll sue.&quot; No. If I hit you, you&#x27;ll probably die because I&#x27;m a ton and a half of metal and you&#x27;re 150 pounds of water and carbon.<p>Cars are big and they are very dangerous. I may love my car and I love driving it. I love biking and I love walking as well and in some places in the world, we&#x27;ve designed it so that all of these activities can be done in close proximity with relatively high safety and everyone needs to do their part to keep it a safe environment. When cars don&#x27;t respect bikers, people get hurt. When bikes don&#x27;t respect cars and predictability (by staying in their lane, going WITH traffic, stopping at traffic lights, or staying on the sidewalk, etc), people get hurt. When pedestrians think they&#x27;re God and don&#x27;t pay attention to cars OR bikes, people get hurt.<p>I have no idea what happened in this single instance that the article itself is talking about; but frustration with a certain kind of biker does not automatically result in believing &quot;it&#x27;s okay to not treat cyclists who are killed in traffic accidents as human beings&quot;.",1386615724

They usually do it outside their territorry to assert influence on countries and place allies in power, grab resources, prevent unfavorable regime change etc.<p>(Nothing to do with establishing democracy either: they are impartial to that, and have worked with regimes such as the apartheid in S.A., Pinochet etc, including of course people like Noriega, Saddam and Ossama, which they later broke ties with when their foreign interests didn&#x27;t ally as well, but who were just as scum when they were pals).",1386615608

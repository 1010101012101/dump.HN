You will have to get a working web server for one.  Configuring Apache on Ubuntu should be a good learning experience.  If you can also get a working database server such as PostgreSQL (my preference) or MySQL working with your website, you will know the basics for building a real web-based application.\n",1179880554

I've chosen not to do it myself for the same reason I'm not an SEO guy. It's unpredictable, a time sink, and it'd be hard for me to be proud of the result of my effort. I think it's easier to just create something of value. If you do that your domain name is mostly unimportant.<p>\n",1179879732

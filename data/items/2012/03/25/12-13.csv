3752454,comment,3751225,3751225,1,0,telemachos,,,"There are two issues in this thread.<p>First, a confusion: this book has nothing to do with Zed Shaw's Learn X the Hard Way series. (I have no idea if Zed ever heard the title even. He may have come to it - the title - completely independently.) <i>This</i> book predates Zed's series, and has a very different goal. Zed's book, as I understand it, targets novices. The difficulty in the title is that you must do all the exercises and learn from a lot of repetition and trying things on your own (as well as looking up docs, further examples, etc. online). The Downey book, on the other hand, is aimed at people with a programming or CS background who want to learn Perl rapidly. The difficulty is that he moves very fast and assumes you can handle things like a fairly dense Markov text generator by page 26.<p>Second, a lot of people say (assume?) that the book is out of date because it's from 2003. Actually, <i>for its goal</i>, I think that's wrong. If you are an experienced programmer who wants to rapidly learn Perl's core syntax, I think this is still a good place to start. You certainly might follow it up with <i>Modern Perl</i> or lots of readings in <i>perldoc</i> and <i>perldelta</i>, but the core syntax and features of Perl 5 have not actually changed that much I think. I can't think of any book that covers as much, with as many examples in such a short book. It's also very clearly written.",1332680197

3752441,comment,3751767,3751767,1,0,droithomme,,,"OK, so they analyzed 69,000 schools by comparing test scores to a model they created predicting what the scores should be, and 200 out of the 69,000, or 0.3%, didn't match the model. (Note: main article says 200 districts, but the associated article showing the data says 200 schools <a href=""http://www.ajc.com/news/cheating-our-children-1393866.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ajc.com/news/cheating-our-children-1393866.html</a>)<p>It's amazing that 99.7% of schools matched their model. Must be a very good model.<p>It's ridiculous that they are using this to say there is evidence of cheating though since, even though their model is 99.7% accurate, it is not 100% accurate, and that's to be expected.<p>The methodololgy also relies on questionable assumptions. They look at 3 year slices to find cases where test scores jumped up one year and then back down the next. They consider these evidence of systematic, district wide cheating. That is unproven. If it was cheating, why would the scores go back down. Is there a correlation then between years of upswing and schools being on the list of underperforming schools about to be forcibly shut down by the feds? That might be evidence of cheating if so. But if that was so it would surely be claimed in the study. Also, district wide cheating means a mass conspiracy in which hundreds of teachers managed to, under direction of a coordinated central authority, successfully cheat for one year but not the next, and to keep the secret, and did so at hundreds of schools. That's quite a conspiracy.<p>I am sure cheating takes place from time to time, but it is far more likely to happen at the individual teacher level than as something happening district wide and thus coming from a central source because the larger a conspiracy gets, the less likely it is that everyone can keep the secret. Checking for schools that have a single year with higher scores and finding a small number that do is poor evidence of a cheating conspiracy.",1332679742

That can make a big readability difference in things like simple polynomials; a^2 + b^2 = c^2 is just that in TeX, but a lot more wordy in eqn. The troff/eqn looks a bit less like line noise, though, especially in things like ""from"" in the summation, and >= for \geq.<p>Though really I'd guess that TeX's math notation caught on as the de-facto standard for ""ASCII math"" because TeX as a whole caught on, rather than because of its ASCII-math representation being better.",1332678405

So beginners could write conditions and call API functions without much or any typing.<p>It's very important for me to not hinder the productivity of people who already have scripting / game dev experience and as such I want the scripts to be fully editable with a keyboard. There will probably be a way to edit your scripts externally at some point too.<p>The details are still a bit blurry as I'm quite busy implementing all the other core features but it's coming together. I'm looking at a lot of what has been done, too.<p>CraftStudio has scenes, which are pretty similar to Unity 3D scenes. You have game objects in a hierarchy and you can add components to them to render stuff or add physics or script behaviors.<p>I plan on using Lua as the underlying scripting language, but I might change my mind by the time I get around to implementing it. I expect (just a wild guess) to have scripting support ready sometimes over the next 2-3 months.<p>There will be a library of ""black box"" scripts with a bunch of variables and nobs you can turn. People will be able to make more and share them with the community. You'll also be able to reveal the underlying code if you want to tweak it to your specific needs.<p>On that front, I think CraftStudio has the potential to get people into programming by starting with simple tools and then learning with the help of others thanks to the real-time collaborative editing capabilities. Being able to chat and interact about code will be pretty awesome I think.",1332678324

I mean, I understand your point, and it makes total sense, but it may not be in everyone's interest to act on this.<p>Let me give you an example. I interned in a company in France that would hire only from the top 3 engineering and top 3 business schools in France. I had friends who where very successful interns in the company, but who didn't get hired full time in the end because they came from the 4th or 5th business school.<p>Now I've been talking about this a lot, and the main argument I heard was: HR people are just trying to cover their asses in case something goes wrong. In France (I don't know if it's the same here), firing an employee is so difficult that companies want to make sure they don't screw up when hiring. Or rather, HR want to make sure that if they screw up, nobody can hold them responsible. If they think a non-degree holder would be a good fit, that they hire him, and that this non-degree holder turns out to be not so good, then everybody is going to ask them why on earth did they bet on someone with no degree. If they stick to someone from a top school, they can still say: look, he seemed really good, he has top credentials.. it's just bad luck, we did everything possible.<p>Someone mentioned institutional inertia above. I think that's exactly what this is about.<p>Note: I'm not generalizing to all HR people. I've read lots of posts on HN concerning the hiring process, and it seems that people take it seriously in the startup world.

I&#x27;m old enough to have actually used WordStar, Bank Street Writer, and company on old XTs, as well as their successors up through the latest versions of Word, and in word processors, there simply hasn&#x27;t been any significant advance in the fundamental interface of writing prose.  Laying out a business letter or other specially-formatted document, maybe.  Prose, no.<p>When writing prose is your primary concern, squiggly lines and auto-correct and whatnot are simply irritating distractions.  Hence the whole stripped-down, no-distractions word processor niche, especially on the Mac.  If you already <i>have</i> a stripped-down, no-distractions word processor you&#x27;ve been using since the Reagan administration, you really don&#x27;t <i>need</i> a new one.  Hell, it&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t used word processors for plain prose in years and just used whatever text editor I preferred at the time (with the occasional spell-check pass).",1400108398

Luckily since mobile devices didn&#x27;t (iPhone) support is or supported it badly (Android) it became out of favor. This was eased a lot by the situation that many people already disliked Flash in their browser.<p>May DRM become out of favor, too. Thus as a first step, you - as a customer - should never accept websites that use any DRM mechanism. Write to their customer support and if they don&#x27;t offer a DRM-free version cancel subscriptions. Closing your purse is a powerful tool.",1400108310

Die on your sword, keep the trust of your dwindling user base or implement DRM and retain most of your user base (minus the people that will leave because of this decision).

7746949,comment,7746793,7746793,4,0,smussmann,,,"> There are lots of properties by which one can evaluate a hash function, but the most important are preimage resistance (if I give you a hash, can you find an input with that hash value?), second preimage resistance (if I give you a message, can you find another that hashes to the same value?) and collision resistance (can you find two messages with the same hash?). Of those, the third appears to be much harder to meet than the first two, based on historical results against hash functions.<p>To my (crypto noob) eyes, it seems like second preimage resistance is just a specific case of collision resistance.  In both, we&#x27;re trying to find two messages that have the same hash value, but with collision resistance, we can choose the first one arbitrarily.

If you want to know why we have DRM in the web, step 1 is taking a look in the mirror. Mozilla does not represent a majority market share of browser users, and so their voice in the W3C can be over-ruled by the voices of the other stakeholders, among them 3 enormous corporations with substantial media interests.<p>What follows is harsh, but I believe it to be true.  Feel free to tell me that I am wrong, because I fully admit that I could be letting my emotions speak and I could be wrong.<p>Back in the day the web was ruled by a monopoly and it sucked. Mozilla released firefox but the web only broke free of microsoft&#x27;s control because people like us did the work to break that control. I started using firefox, and I helped get most of my family members onto it. And many of my tech savvy friends did the same. Slowly but surely Mozilla&#x27;s market share grew until it reached the point where Microsoft had to react and start to implement web standards, because if they didn&#x27;t people weren&#x27;t going to wait for them.  They were going to switch to Firefox. And for a brief time we had the promise of a global network for the distribution of information not controlled by a single large corporation, but worked on by a committee which had a large part of its membership come from a public benefit corporation, whose only interest was empowering people to use that network to enhance their lives.<p>The web exploded, and fearful of being left behind large corporations got into the game with their own browsers. And rather than learn from what happened last time we let a large corporation get majority user share, we, and by &quot;we&quot; I mean you and I and all of the other people who should know better, went right for it.<p>Google released a cute cartoon describing the inception of chrome, beginning with hiring away people from Mozilla, talking about all of the great things their browser would provide.  Microsoft started up development of IE again, and Apple released Safari. A lot of us looked at Firefox and said &quot;Thanks for helping to save the web as we know it, but Chrome is <i>so</i> much more minimal! Safari as a great <i>look and feel</i>! See ya later&quot;. Richard Stallman gets a lot of flack around here for his eccentricity when it comes to computing, but goddammit the man can see past his own nose and understands that taking a dump on the only body advocating for you and I in favor of switching to something on such trivial concerns as &quot;look and feel&quot; is a great way to end up right where we are today.  Where Mozilla has been marginalized so much by the relentless rush to Chrome that Google can go ahead and implement a DRM scheme on its proprietary OS and then force that through the Web Standards body with the help of Apple and Microsoft. When Mozilla doesn&#x27;t have enough market share to stop it, because we&#x27;ve all switched over the Chrome based on Octane benchmark scores, and switched over our parents and friends. Where I routinely run into &quot;desktop&quot; sites that are straight up broken in Firefox and fine in Chrome because people can&#x27;t bother with anything other than webkit prefixes, and where the mobile web is an even bigger disaster of Chrome/Safari specific junk.<p>So a few years from now, as you continue to bask in the glow google&#x27;s super minimal interface and safari&#x27;s incredible smoothness, as Chrome sends your browsing data back to Google and DRM starts to leak into other areas of the web (want to save that image? Sorry! Want to copy this text? Protected! Don&#x27;t even think about looking at the source) cast a thought to Mozilla, probably still working away to do the best it can for you. Then ask yourself if selling out the web was worth it for the handful of beads you got from all the interests that wanted to close it down and lock it up, and if all the smoothness and look and feel in the world was worth it for the promise of what the web might have been had we not let it slip through our hands.",1400107220

The companies that manage the internet in the United States have demonstrated no interest in upholding the founding values of the internet: openness and cooperation. Who can blame them when they have shareholders demanding more and more profits. The FCC must step in to remove these business decisions that are not in the interest of internet consumers. The cost of peering, content delivery and other important parts of managing the internet infrastructure are supposed to be covered by the service costs of each entity accessing the internet. Netflix pays for connections to the internet to their service providers and anyone who is paying an ISP to access the internet should expect that the cost of their service completely covers their share of the ISP&#x27;s costs to deliver it to them.<p>I read today that a number of telecommunications companies are suggesting that the infrastructure of the internet would crumble if the FCC declares it telecommunications. The fact is, companies are always going to have to be dragged kicking and screaming for change. They always make accusations like that and they always seem to get along just fine when decisions are not in the favor of their interests. Companies always suggest that they are well-equipped to provide services because they can more easily adapt to changes in their business. This is a change we must make and they must adapt—or someone else will.<p>Best regards,<p>Jerrid Kimball",1400106254

You can&#x27;t take your physical book and let 500 people read it simultaneously. So there&#x27;s no need for even considering restrictions on what you can do with your physical book. The closest thing that comes to mind is scanning and re-printing the book 500 times and distributing that. And you <i>can&#x27;t do that</i>. That&#x27;s illegal.<p>> I don&#x27;t see how it correlates with any necessity for DRM.<p>Because of the extreme ease of reproduction + distribution, coupled with the near zero chance of being caught, is a strong incentive to violate IP law.<p>> Limited time of rental is justified for physical goods. For digital it&#x27;s not (I explained above why).<p>No you didn&#x27;t. What you said has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the validity of limited-time licensing of the right to view content.<p>> I don&#x27;t see any sense in limiting access. Netflix can charge the same thing for unlimited access, plus allowing making backups and still make the profit<p>Hah, in your dreams. Netflix&#x27;s ability to negotiate (with the content providers) for the legal right to stream content to you is predicated on there being limitations. The more unrestricted the access, the more they have to pay.<p>Not only that, but if you did remove all limitations (and restricting access to the duration of your membership is, of course, a limitation), then there would be no reason for people to stay Netflix members for longer than it takes to download and save all the movies they want to watch for the next few months. Subscribe for one month, download 6 months worth of movies, unsubscribe. Doesn&#x27;t sound like a great business model, does it? But of course they couldn&#x27;t do this even if they wanted to, because no content provider is going to give Netflix a license to re-license the content to Netflix subscribers in perpetuity.<p>> No, DRM can&#x27;t enforce it (since this stuff is pirated practically instantaneously). So why is it used?<p>Because it&#x27;s better than nothing. New content is pirated pretty fast, sure, but stuff doesn&#x27;t stay easily available forever. Netflix doesn&#x27;t deal in new content anyway (barring their recent ventures into producing their own content, which is a different discussion).<p>Without DRM, if I have a friend with a Netflix subscription, I can just ask him to grab a few movies and send them to me. Not only does this work even if the movies aren&#x27;t easily available on BitTorrent, but it&#x27;s also a lot safer because nobody can track this (whereas BitTorrent does have a non-zero risk of being tracked, or of quality problems, or fakes, etc). At this point it&#x27;s about convenience. Make it hard enough or risky enough to acquire the content for free, and people will decide it&#x27;s easier to just pay for it. And that&#x27;s what DRM does.<p>Granted, DRM solutions do not work particularly <i>well</i>. But in the eyes of the rights-holders, it works better than nothing.<p>---<p>To clarify, I&#x27;m not an advocate of DRM. I would much rather get content without it. DRM-free content is more convenient to work with than DRM&#x27;d content. But there is a vast gulf between saying &quot;I&#x27;d rather have DRM-free content&quot; and saying &quot;All content <i>must</i> be DRM-free&quot;. The former is something I can ask for.

By that I mean it is just a blob of parameters that can be inspected. The serializer is not just a configuration, it&#x27;s something with an &#x27;er&#x27; on the end.

That for most people the content is more important gives the false signal that people are choosing DRM (which, in reality, pretty much nobody would).<p>That&#x27;s not a functional free market.

7746702,comment,7743186,7745345,5,0,vardump,,,"Lack of generics is not really significant. Other advantages in golang are worth much more than this minor deficit. Such as very fast compilation time, goroutines, channels, taggable structs (makes XML or JSON a breeze) and multiple return values -- one can get rid of bug inducing complicated control flow, that exceptions typically cause. Exceptions tend to be very hard to maintain and reason about and they tend to move the code dealing with the errors far away from where the exceptions are thrown. Probably a lot of people disagree about this, but humor me -- I write C++ as my dayjob. Oh, and I prefer golang&#x27;s &quot;defer&quot; over RAII. It gets most of the job done in a way simpler fashion.<p>Even when generics are available, they&#x27;re about a fraction of one percent of code. Other languages have been doing just fine without generics. Even Java has just syntactic sugar compile time type erasure hack instead of the real deal. Those List<String>s are just List<Object>s in bytecode. I don&#x27;t remember any C-programmer complaining either.<p>What&#x27;s very cool about golang in general, is that rather than including all the possible features you can think of (looking at you, C++!), it&#x27;s more of how few features you can have while still having an expressive and powerful language.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to talk down other languages or to praise golang, but I do want to point out one should look at the big picture and not let small details distract.

It&#x27;s possible that this may be presented to the user in a way similar to a plugin installation, except that the plugin happens to be provided by Mozilla (not a third-party).<p>This isn&#x27;t great, but to the end user, it looks the same as Flash and Silverlight.<p>Especially if Mozilla were to add click-to-play for all such plugins, along with an explanation of what they are (think of the warnings that are currently shown for self-signed certs), they may still have an opportunity to do good with this yet.<p>I&#x27;d really love for Mozilla to remain as true to its mission as possible. On the other hand, Mozilla&#x27;s power to do good in the world is intrinsically linked to its marketshare[1]. If Mozilla ends up being the lone holdout, it&#x27;s possible that they will just lose marketshare as DRM content becomes more widespread - that would be quite a Pyrrhic victory[2].<p>I share in the EFF&#x27;s disappointment at the situation, though (saldy) this has been inevitable for some time.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7744954"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7744954</a><p>[1] Perhaps not 100%, but it&#x27;s a major component of it.<p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory</a>",1400104817

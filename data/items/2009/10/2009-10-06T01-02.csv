Having watched a bit of Law & Order, my answer was, ""I think I need to talk to my lawyer"".  They persisted, and provided me with a lot of false information.  At this point, I was annoyed at how wrong they were and said ""yeah, I wrote this"" and pulled up the comment in question.<p>(Resolution: they read the comment, realized that someone Higher Up totally overreacted, and went away.)<p>Basically, detectives are trained to extract information, and they are good at doing so.

If I were not interested in hiring women who were old, ugly, fat or have children then I'd have a serious lawsuit on my hands.""<p>If you looked at the other OkCupid chart, it shows that race has little impact on interracial match %. It's fairly certain that ""old, ugly, fat, have children"" are all characteristics that would lower the match %, therefore you argument of equating these different traits is debunked.<p>Your bit about hiring is also suspect. Think about 50+ years ago when minorities such as blacks really weren't up to standard due to years of slavery and persecution.

A passing test doesn't always mean anything important has changed - like most other programming tools, there are circumstances where unit tests just create the illusion of progress. I also remember Norvig saying* that sometimes the scope of pass/fail tests may be too narrow, because sometimes having 18 of the first 20 results be reasonable is good enough, but typical testing packages aren't really structured to accommodate probabilistic thinking. Certainly more relevant for some problems than others, but interesting nonetheless.<p>I've seen <i>major</i> benefits from automated testing, and I'm convinced they're a net win (especially for maintenance), but I also think that being dogmatic about any particular testing methodology (TDD, etc.) is going to be counterproductive sometimes.<p>* I don't remember if it was from the same book, PAIP, AIMA, or something else - I've been bouncing around in several AI and Prolog-related texts lately.",1254792667

That is the stuff that must never break, and where breakages would not be immediately detectable.  The unit tests ensure that you are always sure that that code works.<p>(Real world example; testing somewhat hairy parsing code: <a href=""http://github.com/jrockway/moosex-runnable/blob/master/t/arg-parser.t"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jrockway/moosex-runnable/blob/master/t/arg...</a>  I test every case I could come up with, so I could be sure that it works.  Better to spend the time typing this file than to be hit with a weird misparse on the command-line, where you are probably not in the mood to fix the parser.)<p>On top of the unit tests, I do integration tests, to make sure sections of my app mostly work together.  This is somewhere below ""Request -> Response"" and somewhere above the individual routines/classes.  In the web app case, this is mostly ""instantiate an object graph; call the methods that provide data to the rendering functions; make sure the results make sense"".  (I assume my template renderer and object database work; those have their own test suite, after all.)  I also test stuff like typical sequences of actions that share some state (usually ""the session"").  I neglected that once and it caused me lots of problems.<p>But anyway, GUI testing == waste of time.  As long as the buttons you click generate the right events, the GUI works.

The hurdle comes down to: Do you want to be able to test your app while developing it? Or do you just want to write it, make sure it compiles, and ship it?<p>If you just want the latter, then you will be able to get away with not owning a Mac to do a lot of testing and to sign with. You won't likely end up with a very good app. But you will have an app. OTOH, if you want to make a very nice application, that performs well, has a good UI and so on etc, you really should have a Mac. It gives you two big things: The iPhone Simulator and the ability to put apps on your device.<p>While the simulator might not matching device behavior for optimizations (if you need to do any), is fantastic for laying views out and testing if logic works. Its great for fixing small bugs that would exist also exist on the device. There is a caveat: not all behavior on the Simulator is the same as the device. This is frustrating at times. But, with a Mac, you can actually put your app on an iPhone. Codesign is (AFAIK), very much Mac-only.<p>Yes, you can develop on Windows or Linux, jailbreak and put your app on your device that way, but, you really do want to test your app in the same environment that a majority of your customers from the App Store are going to have. This means a non-jailbroken device. Which, again, brings us back to needing to Codesign. And needing a Mac.",1254791419

This makes a helluva lot of sense as an evolutionary strategy -- you learn what your species looks like by observing as many other members as you can, and then you try to mate with the least unusual-looking person you can. Aside from protecting your offspring from the weird disability-causing genes which are sometimes signalled by unusual-looking features, it's also a great strategy if you assume everyone else is using it too: if you mate with a non-unusual looking partner you'll get non-unusual-looking kids, who will then be sought-after mating partners.<p>Anyway, if our brains really do use this strategy I think it goes a long way towards explaining some of this data.<p>edit: I don't mean to imply that this is the only criterion our brains use -- we probably find most attractive people who are slightly taller, more muscular and/or larger-breasted than the average we see while growing up. However in other things like facial structure where no particular face is objectively fitter than any other, heading towards the average is a pretty good plan.",1254791171

Race, culture, gender, and religion <i>should</i> have no bearing on anything, but in practice, they do.<p>I'm not sure that a statement like the one you suggest would get you labeled racist, at least not among people who are capable of critical thinking.  The fact remains that race <i>is</i> a predictor of academic success.  It shouldn't be, but it is.  To be a bit more socially sensitive, you might prefix that statement with ""unfortunately,"" but I think that's one of the less-inflammatory things you can say that have a racial bent.",1254790993

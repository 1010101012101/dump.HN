Microsoft may not have included _this specific_ software, but how does HTC know they didn't include anything like it? I don't believe Microsoft gives handset makers the source code for the software. I know they don't allow them to customize it. Perhaps HTC has not installed anything like it or been allowed to install anything like it, but how would HTC know if MS did it themselves?",1322675975

It also has acceptable-to-good performances (on unices anyway) but <i>the default configuration is completely untuned</i>.<p>This default is meant to run on very weak machines, so the db ""works"" everywhere OOTB, many people don't configure their postgres (and it's not been trivial historically, it's gotten a lot better) and end up with miserable performances.<p>This issue is most visible with ""the other open-source database"" (MySQL) as it has 1. a much more aggressive default configuration and 2. MyISAM default (I think it might have been switched now, but that's pretty recent), which has very fast reads (and nothing else)<p>An other issue with postgres is probably the lack of postgres DBAs (let alone good ones) compared to Oracle and MSSQL, though any good and open-minded DBA should be able to get up-to-speed quick on it. The last issue would be tooling, I believe MS provides lots of administration and GUI tools for MSSQL, there's a dearth of those for postgres.",1322675752

I'm considering heavily to go back home and start a business there (online, offline, doesn't matter). Reasons? cheaper workforce, more power, more connections, cherry picking, bigger pond, more people (consumers), etc.<p>I'll be using North America to include both US and Canada for the rest of my comment.<p>Here are a few more detailed examples (all of them are of course anecdotes to me):<p>Managing westerners that believe that they're entitled for everything such as perks, private offices, their choice of programming languages, their choice of best practices are often a time consuming activity. Back home, I can drive the workforce to do the best practices that I believe without having to have long discussions. Give them laptop, give them work, they're happy. This is because their mindset, perspective, and standard are different than here in North America. They're also cheaper.<p>After working with many programmers throughout my careers, I kind of grow a belief that I can train the less ""creative"" developers back home to be at the same level at most of the programmers in North America. They might not reach the level of superstar engineers, but they will reach the level of more than good enough at where I will be.<p>Connection is a big thing. It's harder to have a connection in N.A., especially when you're an immigrant (maybe it's just me). Where I come from, hooking up with people who have excess money is very easy.

In order to use it, a cryptanalyst must solve, at least, two problems: to create a memory dump from target machine and to distinguish target cryptographic keys from other data. The latter leads to a new mathematical task: <<recognition of cryptographic keys in the (random) data stream>>. The complexity of this task significantly depends on target cryptoalgorithm. For some algorithms (i.e. AES or Serpent) this task is trivial but for other ones it may be very hard. In this work we present effective algorithms of expanded key recognition for Blowfish and Twofish. As far as we know this task for these algorithms has never been considered before.\nCategory : side-channel attacks, live-memory analysis, digital forensics, blowfish, twofish.

These tools take you to the line in your SCSS file that's causing issues instead of referring to the compiled CSS.<p>I mean, hear what you mean but I think the level of annoyance or love for these tools depends on your workflow. Personally, I use LESS along with CodeKit (I used to use LESS.app) and I usually don't have those problems. The times that I do run into a line number reference problem I'm usually able to find the offending code quite easily as the line in my abstraction language file (LESS, Coffeescript, whatever) is usually only a few lines lower than what the debugger tells me. In addition, if the debugging tools give me just a short snippet of the offending code then I can pretty easily remember where it is regardless of how large the file is.<p>In the end though I think this is all about a person's workflow. Some workflows are better suited to these abstraction languages and their compilers/debuggers than others.  Personal preference, I guess, is what it comes down to.",1322673970

3295768,comment,3292310,3294604,5,0,shadytrees,,,"DFW references this argument in his fiction, so I'll try to do it justice: I respectfully disagree. Depression does not stem from ""I don't what happiness is"". A depressed person is aware of happiness, of the fact that he or she right now should be happy because everybody else at the dinner table is laughing and having a great time, of the fact that he or she knows how to pretend happy and a great time while at the same time hating the pretension. Being depressed is constantly looking onto happiness but being denied access; being depressed is being depressed about the fact that you don't have access, which in turn makes you more depressed.<p>I don't think the way DFW meant to end that sentence is ""but he really isn't"". That paragraph, that entire piece really, is about the audience's predatory relationship with athletes. That last paragraph is addressed at people who watch, not people who participate. Michael Joyce <i>is</i> happy; we should just be wary of the kind of happiness.",1322673120

I directed to my github account and have been writing little tutorials to answer his questions over email. It really helps you get a better understanding of your own skills when you teach it to others. I'd also much prefer someone ask me directly than reading some tutorials online. There are so so many tutorials online that are teaching people the old, non-standard way of doing things. Basically, it's like all the tutorials from 1997 somehow get the best rankings in google for ""HTML tutorial"". Though it is important not to overestimate your skill level and hopefully you aren't passing along bad practices and techniques to others.<p>Other ways to move the web forward: stop supporting Internet Explorer altogether. That browser needs to stop being coddled and forced to get with the times. The difference between Webkit and Gecko rendering is almost a non issue but when you start having to support Trident then it's almost like having to code a site twice. Let's just stop supporting it and either let that thing die or force it to keep up. Version 9 and 10 are steps in the right direction but it can do better.<p>That said, we can't always drop IE support. Very high traffic, corporate, and intranet sites will still need to have support for IE for some time but all in all, lets drop it when it makes sense. Personal sites and even some business sites can work. I personally don't do anything to specifically support IE on my own business' website and it hasn't hurt me a bit. Let's take a risk here and there and drop IE support and move forward.<p>Moving forward is about more than just code though. It's also about user experience. A site with code that's 100% valid but is hard to use or uses distracting elements like gratuitous animations isn't moving forward. It's just building a site that looks like its from the 90's except with modern, valid code. That's lame.",1322672898

Unfortunately, they're not quite bad enough to outweigh the standard-library advantage for most people, so they stick around. They should have been designed better years ago, but there we are: the curse of the included battery.<p>That said, I don't agree with the OP's implication that just about everything would be better as separate libraries. Node itself has a sizable standard library, and it's generally well-designed.<p>The start of a project is the riskiest time, and having to suspend work to evaluate multiple third-party libraries for every little feature is a huge distraction. 80% solutions close at hand could make the difference between a successful proof of concept and one that never gets off the ground. There are also positive network effects from having sample code written to a common API.<p>Python's early failure to anoint a standard baseline web framework is a case study in the risks of avoiding a batteries-included approach. PHP later rose to take that space, and then Rails ended up being written in a different language. We can't know how an alternate history would turn out, but it was clear at that time that Python's web development community was hopelessly fragmented, hit by the double whammy of not including a web framework and making it so much fun to write your own.<p>The OP does have a point I agree with, which is that having batteries included is less important than before, because package managers are so much better. That means we can hold built-in libraries to a higher standard.<p>The other part of the puzzle is a way to bless a high-quality third-party library as a baseline for each common niche that isn't already in the standard library, so developers starting a project aren't spoiled by choice.",1322672536

There are fewer lines to move, so its easier to remember exactly what youre moving, and I dont have to worry about forgetting to move the closing tag. You do have to re-indent after you move the lines, but you would do that anyway with plain HTML. I did a lot of moving code around the page when I implemented Photoshop designs, and I was thankful for that aspect of HAML.<p>I also used the embedded-Ruby feature to DRY-ly have variations on a page prototype. I was able to switch between four different versions of the page by changing just one variable at the top  I used case statements and a few Ruby helpers on the page to enable the appropriate sections and CSS classes of that version. That was for a static page not linked to any web framework  it was nice to be able to use code without having to set up a huge framework.

Spotify appears to be worse off because using Spotify its ""free"" and I have even less incentive to buy the real track.<p>tl;dr I could not agree with smackfu/article more, just pirate everything and donate $5 directly to your favorite artist, you already made them more money than spotify ever would for you. And your conscious is clear.",1322672447

MMOs are designed to keep you playing for hours upon hours; FPSs, though some do the same, are structured in 5-15 min individual games. And all that time is spent playing, unlike MMOs where boring downtime spent chatting can dominate the experience at the upper end and in some games (like EVE).",1322672441

I didn't see any CarrierIQ process, but the Blur framework is logging tons of stuff on ADB, such as all key inputs for the autocompletion software or every swipe movement on the home screen, but no https query appear to be logged at first glance. ""Search Intent"" terms on the other hand are logged. I never really trusted Blur because until the latest few versions of the ADT the LogCat console was messed up with debug messages from EON & Blur and it was a pain to keep it somewhat static and readable for my own devs, but these couple reports on keylogging frameworks make me look twice at my own phone now.<p>I'd like to run wireshark to check out what's really going out of my phone when I'm on the wifi - I'm a bit of a novice in that area (network monitoring), does anyone have any pointers of things to look for?",1322672434

Here's the response I got:<p>""Dear Kevin Jacobs,<p>I understand you would like more information about the Carrier IQ software, or any software of this nature on your device. I understand your concerns about this issue and protecting my privacy is definitely one of my top priorities as well.<p>We have not had any reports of any kind of software like this on any Windows Phone 7 device. This type of software has been used on Android devices, but since Microsoft developed this operating system I am sure they did not include any software of this kind.<p>Let me know if I have successfully answered your question, please click here to complete this.<p>To send a reply to this message, please click here.<p>Sincerely,<p>Kathleen<p>HTC""",1322672409

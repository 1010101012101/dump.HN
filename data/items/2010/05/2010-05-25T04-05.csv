Everyone should need to learn Lisp, even if you never ever program it, simply to avoid developing some of these poisonous XML-flavored tools. He mentions Ant specifically. Let me tell you, as an unwilling Microsoft Build expert, XML should be NOWHERE NEAR your build system. He puts down Makefiles, but as someone who wrote a Makefile for the first time after years of Ant and MSBuild, it was like a breath of fresh air. The intentional lack of power is what makes it so great. If anything, Makefiles are too powerful and too close to turing complete.<p>Here is what a make file should look like:<p>1) vpath statements for various file extensions<p>2) Phony targets for logical build units, including ""all""<p>3) Generic rules for mapping <i>.abc to </i>.xyz; these rules should have <i>exactly</i> one line of code which executes an external script/tool<p>4) A list of edges in the dependency graph<p>5) A few variables as necessary to eliminate redundant edges<p>If you put any logic in your Makefiles, you are doing it wrong.<p>If your builds are slow, add empty dummy files for larger culling by timestamps. If timestamps are insufficient, codify early out logic into tools.<p>Not having logic in my Makefiles enables parallel execution and strong support for incremental builds. If I were to use Lisp as a build system, I'd create a DSL that had these same properties; forbidding arbitrary logic in my dependency graph. It's about finding the right balance to inject expressiveness without losing desirable properties of the DSL. This is why every developer needs to understand more about programming language design. Anytime you create any type of file format, you are doing it. And anytime you are writing any type of file format, you are reverse engineering it. Understanding the intended separation of logic for Makefiles helps me write better Makefiles.",1274763015

The original article however talks about how data always ends up hierarchical and tree-like. JSON represents tree-like data very succinctly and very readably.<p>Still, the real XML-killer for me is YAML. It's even more readable than JSON, and allows many documents in a single file. This makes it excellent for logs, or for any application where your files get big and you want to stream records off them without having to parse the whole file into memory at once. Sure, you can do this with XML and parser hooks, but it's so much more of a pain than just iterating over top-level YAML documents.<p>Another killer feature is that it's simple enough that I've been able to ask clients to provide me with information in YAML format just by giving them an example record to follow.

1376542,comment,1375823,1376196,0,0,jrockway,,,"I've written a lot of Emacs Lisp and a lot of Perl.  Perl is better for bulk text processing, but that's not what editors do.  The Emacs API is great for text editing.  Once you are willing to treat blocks of text as buffers, everything gets very easy with Emacs Lisp.  But most people are afraid to do that, because they are used to working with big opaque text objects and big batch transforms.<p>(Say you want to prefix every sentence with the expression ""And then he said, "".  The perl way: replace every empty space after a period or the beginning of the string with ""And then he said, "".  Emacs way:  While there are sentences, go to the beginning of the next sentence and  insert ""And then he said, "".  Same result, different way of thinking.)<p>Modify your way of thinking, and the Emacs model is wonderful.

1376534,comment,1376293,1376293,0,0,andreyf,,,"I've been thinking about an interesting model for working remotely - something that might be called micro-outsourcing. The paying party provides a set of automated tests (like unit tests, but with speed/space constraints) and a price. Coders submit code which runs against the tests. If it passes, the payer can pay their predetermined amount to buy the source. The idea is to make the turn around fast enough that it makes more sense to program even simple code by ""micro-outsourcing"" dozens of ~1 hr pieces every day. This way, you could get ~50 hours of code written in a day's time while still keeping the entire architecture of the system in your head.<p>PS: someone said something insightful, but for some reason deleted it, along the lines of ""this will pinpoint the problems of relying on unit tests for correctness"". This is very true - one of the Interesting Problems such a project would need to solve is a set of tools to let users quickly design useful unit tests. I'm in no way delusional about automated tests not being able to <i>prove</i> correctness.

But the last I looked (three or four years ago) development had stalled. And I got into a job where I periodically had to SSH to various Solaris boxes and edit on the console, in Vim. I knew just enough Vim to edit config files and simple shell scripts without too much pain. Then I'd come back out to jEdit and start putting :s and other Vim commands in my files. It was hard to shift gears.<p>So I decided to pick an editor that I could stay with for a long time, maybe forever, because it did so many things and was so configurable. It had to run on my Mac at home, the Windows nd Unix machines at work, and also on the console. It came down to Emacs or Vim. My boss was an Emacs guy, and could do wonderful things with it. But I'd had a few RSS problems, and I'd read about what Emacs did to some users' hands. So I went with Vim, and I'm very happy with it.<p>Really, the only downside is that I don't have Vim everywhere, so when I'm stuck somewhere that doesn't have it my hands do the wrong thing. (Like in our crappy email system. I write long messages in Vim and paste them in, but I do short ones in the mail client. And hit escape when I'm done. And then hit cancel to say that I'm not abandoning the message.)<p>As far as I know, the only editor more configurable than Vim is Emacs. But Vim does do a lot. I use it for Ruby, shell scripts, HTML, CSS, XML, Perl, prose, looking around in log files, and more. It handles long files easily. You can script it with its built-in language (not as powerful as ELisp, of course) or other scripting languages.<p>I sometimes meet people who don't know the difference between Vi and Vim. When I say I use Vim they ask how I can get by with such a limited editor that won't split windows and doesn't have tabs and so on. So when I say Vim, I mean Vim 7.2, available at vim.org.<p>But Emacs and other tools are worth getting familiar with as well. It's good to not be too provincial.",1274761534

I had Rubella (german measles) that almost killed me, mumps which I remember being very sick, and ChickenPox.  We still have to fight the flu but I had the Asian flu when I was very young as well.  Many people died that year, 1957. Estimates are about 70,000 in the USA.  <a href=""http://www.britannica.com/event/Asian-flu-of-1957"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.britannica.com/event/Asian-flu-of-1957</a><p>An interesting story about the German Measles. Our family physician at the time told my mother to expose me to my next door neighbor that had the measles because I would get it anyway. So I remember sitting with him for an afternoon.  I don&#x27;t remember anything else from the next 2 weeks. My mother apologized till the day she died for doing that to me.<p>&quot;What doesn&#x27;t kill you makes you stronger.&quot; Or at least that is the lie that I remind myself once in awhile.",1445619571

We&#x27;re talking about the economy <i>this year</i> vs the economy <i>last year</i> (or next year).  We aren&#x27;t anywhere near the fundamental limits of the amount of material, or the amount of space.  Therefore, what the rest of us mean by &quot;the economy&quot; has plenty of room to grow.  And that&#x27;s where &quot;the new pie&quot; comes from - it&#x27;s the growth in the actual economy as experienced by actual humans participating in it, not growth in the fundamental limits of the economy.<p>There are (probably) fundamental limits to the economy.  That&#x27;s a different topic than the one the rest of us are talking about, though.<p>You keep using the same words (&quot;pie&quot;, &quot;economy&quot;) to talk about something different, and then you argue that we&#x27;re wrong.

And that&#x27;s that venture-backed entrepreneurial companies are, by and large, the new Research & Development Departments. Acquihires can in fact be great deals for VCs, founders, employees, and acquirers. Many companies are curtailing their own research agendas and relying upon smart technology investments to position them for the 5-10-15 year time horizon. I suspect we will ultimately consider this a vastly more efficient form of capital allocation than the old-fashioned &quot;R&D Department&quot; at IBM, GE, DuPont, AT&T, etc.",1445619472

If they don&#x27;t have an extra $20/month, chances are they will not have time to sit and write a letter to a senator, or to call a lawyer or organize campaigns.<p>As the article put it, adding these fees and doing this is really an administrative step, it&#x27;s just too easy not to do it. If they, say, tried to raise taxes on top tax bracket, that would turn into a long uphill battle probably. There would be local town meetings, letter to legislative representatives, calls to country club networks of friends and so on.<p>So as a result there are lots of payday loans places, high fees for courts, jail time (unless fee is paid on the spot), for the poor. Even once they go to prison they are turned effectively into slaves, they can&#x27;t even call home because they nickle and dime there as well.",1445619472

You were the driver behind the wheel.<p>It&#x27;s still the driver&#x27;s fault for not reacting properly. You could have unexpected acceleration or deceleration (which is just as dangerous in some circumstances) due to a lot of different problems; throttle stuck open, O2 Sensor goes wonky and tells the ECU to adjust the fuel mixture in a way that makes your car run rich and stall out, tire blows out causing your car to swerve severely to the right. In all of these cases it is up to the driver to react properly.<p>NOW, if they had proven that there was a design/manufacturing defect in these cars that Toyota knew about and did nothing about (like in the GM faulty ignition switch case), that&#x27;s a different story. That would mean the manufacturer put customers at risk deliberately and not only should they pay financial penalties for that, but there should be jail time involved.<p>However, in the Toyota unintended acceleration case, not only was it very few drivers, they were never even able to establish a cause for the unintended acceleration.

Good writing is a process that includes time to think about that writing. The answer is to write a lot.  After you go through a certain volume of text, you get a better feel for it.  Andy Weir wrote &quot;the Martian&quot; and he was an amateur; he set daily writing goals (word counts) and stuck to them.<p>Reducing amount of written text is not something reporters/writers do easily, because to them every word is sacred, because they wrote it and removing words would always amount to loss of detail.  Good editors manage to reduce that text and still sharpen the message.  Thus, being your own editor can be tough.<p>In the news world, writing is done lightning fast by reporters who are good at hunting information down but not assembling it into a narrative.  The process therefore includes a layer of editing done by someone else who can focus on it.  This is why journalism has a bad name with viral articles written by general assignment reporters who have no expertise in the field (an emerging PR, for example) that they&#x27;re writing about. They&#x27;re expending minimum effort for the greatest return, and that&#x27;s their job.  Compare those to print articles that have had attention, and you&#x27;ll see stark differences.<p>My advice is: I suggest you follow copy-editors to see how they do things; many of them have blogs, some offer courses, but more than anything they give you impression that language changes and you shouldn&#x27;t be frozen when writing.  In fact, what they believe in is that grammar is a living, changing thing.  When you see how copy editors transform text, it becomes eye opening.<p>John McIntyre writes a blog titled &quot;You don&#x27;t Say&quot; about copy editing for the Baltimore Sun (which he&#x27;s done for 29 years now).  Most of his evening shifts start with him grumbling about snipping text (ex: from 28 column inches to 20), which means he <i>has to</i> reduce some articles by 30%.  His reductions are somehow always gains to the reader, but he sure can reduce a reporter to tears.<p>Some simple examples of his editing: &quot;In a prone position&quot; changed to &quot;prone&quot;.  Or, &quot;... to anticipate the problem in advance&quot; replaced with &quot;anticipated.&quot; ; &quot;End result&quot; replaced with &quot;result.&quot; ; &quot;Added bonus&quot; changed to &quot;bonus&quot;.  &quot;New initiative&quot; reduced to &quot;initiative&quot;.

I compiled a list of people I thought would be interested, ranging from tiny bloggers to well-known tech journalists. In each case, I made sure that there was a personal connection between the person I was contacting and my application - either the person had written about finding it difficult to work in noisy environments, or they had written about scientific research on the effects of background noise on productivity, or they mentioned using background noise as a tool for meditation or relaxing, or they had written about a similar service before, etc. Each email was hand-written without using any templates, and each email referenced why I thought that specific person would be interested.

I told you you&#x27;re wrong and that&#x27;s a fact. You said if you just wear a suit etc, you&#x27;re treated well. I showed you, that&#x27;s not true. It&#x27;s that simple. And no I didn&#x27;t prove this with a comedy show, I proved it by giving an example of a correspondent of one of the most watched television shows in the US who was &#x27;dressed splendidly in a tailored suit&#x27;, yet he was stopped. That&#x27;s not comedy, it&#x27;s a fact that throws your contention in the trash. Obviously I can&#x27;t prove anything systematic with anecdotal evidence (which I didn&#x27;t allude to, but thanks for putting those words in my mouth), just like you can&#x27;t prove anything systematic on the basis of your own personal experience. What I can do is merely refute you&#x27;ll always get treated well as long as you simply wear a suit and I think that&#x27;s obvious.<p>Either way it&#x27;s a pretty sad state of affairs one can&#x27;t wear normal attire or sports attire because you&#x27;d be risk getting harassed by police. The notion I&#x27;d want to wear some kind of civility-uniform just to not get wrongfully harassed by people who serve me, who I pay through my taxes, is silly. And it&#x27;s especially painful when this requirement largely falls upon people who happened to be born with a certain skin color (as OP&#x27;s example, supported by many, many studies of racial profiling, shows). To then even feel required to wear a suit, purely to not be treated wrongfully because you have a certain skin color, is degrading. And even then as my example (one of many) shows, you may still be stopped. But feel free to dress &#x27;appropriately&#x27;, whatever that means.

You could use a multi-pronged approach to prop up BrowserID using (continuing to use) OpenID Connect as bootstrapping fabric. Maybe along these lines:<p>* Merge the login.persona.org fallback login provider and Firefox Accounts (grows both userbases!); you&#x27;d probably need a nice path forward to FxA users with Persona-supported email accounts, but that may just be a matter of selling &quot;Connect your FxA account to your Gmail account for easier password management; Here&#x27;s how FxA will (not) use your Gmail information&quot;; (worst-case you need to figure out the BrowserID protocol changes to allow individual email opt-out to a different provider. Maybe easy enough to do in the case of the bridge providers to Gmail/Yahoo as login.persona.org is already mediating that...)<p>* Use the Firefox Accounts &quot;brand&quot; for the fallback provider; this gives potentially a needed distinction between the fallback provider and the platform/tooling (so long as you can do user acceptance testing to maybe avoid confusing users), so that Persona <=> OpenID Connect as a developer brand and FxA as the consumer brand<p>* Setup an OpenID Connect proxy <i>to</i> Persona/BrowserID and call that the &quot;Login with Firefox&quot;...<p>A proxy could drop in to existing OpenID Connect workflows, but really be a wrapper around the BrowserID navigator.id. With Firefox Accounts as the main fallback this is still seen as &quot;Login with Firefox&quot; button This would require fewer changes to the auth code of existing websites (drop in next to your Google/Facebook buttons), but then as people get used to it you can start to encourage websites to &quot;skip the middleman&quot; of the Proxy and directly use Persona/BrowserID navigator.id to back that &quot;Login with Firefox&quot; button.<p>Maybe the only twist here would be a way for other browser manufacturers/plugin-providers to play in this space and keep the branding friendly. An idea might be to add a navigator.id.branding spec that if implemented could override &quot;Login with Firefox&quot; to show a &quot;Login with Chrome&quot; or &quot;Login with Edge&quot; button. The trick of course there would be balancing site CSS abilities and browser branding abilities. Doing so, however, would further reduce the need of consumers to know/learn/interact with the Persona brand and at that point they are just associating that button as the &quot;browser login button&quot;. On the other hand, if FxA is the fallback provider it seems fine to just always have it say &quot;Login with Firefox&quot; and it may be less confusing that way, but with the original goals of BrowserID it might be nice to have it be browser/plugin-configurable solely for that reassuring &quot;Login with my Browser&quot; feel.",1445617433

In Germany, Deutsche Bahn require you to present the exact credit card used to purchase your ticket as identification when asked.<p>The ticket inspector didn&#x27;t believe the passenger, saying &quot;If your card really was stolen, your replacement card will be the same number&quot; and &quot;If your credit card was stolen you would go to the police to report it.&quot;  I spoke up at this point in support, explaining that in other countries (at least in Australia), you get a new credit card number so thieves can&#x27;t use the old number online.  But the officer was convinced card numbers were immutable.  The passenger did have a police report, but the German officer said &quot;This case number is for British Police, checking this is too difficult.&quot;<p>The inspector asked for the passengers passport - understandably the passenger was not about to surrender his main identification to someone else.  The inspector said he could not assist if he did not see the passport, and the passenger then allowed him to <i>see</i> the passport.  But when he provided it, the inspector looked at it, then said &quot;Thank you, I now take this, you do not get this back until the police arrive and the police will decide if they give it back to you.&quot;<p>The passenger was part of a tour group, and all of the other tickets had been valid.  They asked if they would all be arrested, the inspector said no, but when they asked if they could accompany him to the police station, the inspector said &quot;No, you are not allowed to, only he can go with the police.&quot;  The entire group all got out at the next stop anyway, where the passenger was arrested by police.  After an argument the police did allow the tour group to follow, at least through Munich Station for as far as I could see.<p>TLDR: the passenger had a successfully pre-purchased ticket, had passport identification that matched the payment details, bank & police statements to support his story of a stolen credit card, but he was still arrested by Munich police.  And Munich was only a stop they were passing through during their train journey! I adore Germany, but seeing this left a terrible impression.  That Deutsche Bahn card ID policy is crazy, and something is very wrong with Munich&#x27;s authorities.  I&#x27;ll stick to Berlin next time.",1445616734

A complex analysis might have many sub-points that you prove-up in subsequent paragraphs, but your ultimate conclusion still needs to come at the beginning, and each supporting paragraph still needs to lead with the sub-point you&#x27;re proving.<p>Say you&#x27;re writing a memo to your boss explaining why you need to double the size of your engineering team. That point has to come first. Now, maybe the reason you need to double the size of your engineering team is that management wants to add new product lines, and customers are demanding more customized solutions. Okay, so each of those points are the leads in their own paragraphs.<p>Where a lot of people have problems is that their writing is a chronological recounting of their thinking about the issue. So it starts somewhere in the middle where they encountered some part of the overall issue, then backs up to where they recognize the larger issue, and then buries the solution at the end.<p>The structure you were taught in high-school: topic sentence, supporting sentences, conclusion, is simple and appropriate for business communications.

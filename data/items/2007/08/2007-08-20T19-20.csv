44420,comment,44000,44265,0,0,curi,,,"My intended question was by what method the required curriculum should be decided. But I think that's clear now: what you consider ""basic"". What you are proposing is to set up a ruling system that permanently entrenches certain ideas (such as math lessons). No disagreement is allowed: the unwilling should be forced, not tolerated.<p>I think this is a step backwards. In the USA we have moved away from Who Should Rule? and Which Ideas Should Rule? and the focus is more on <i>how should disputes be decided</i>. Force is not a rational answer to that, and we have embodied this in our tolerance for queer and strange people/ideas, even disagreeable ones. The main feature of our system of Government is also about how disputes should be decided: it is responsive to changes in opinion of our citizens (via voting): when many people change their minds about an issue the government is changed correspondingly -- even about basic education. So disputes can be decided by persuasion instead of force.<p>It's worth noting that basic math or reading education are not presently required in some States, so requiring them would reduce freedom of choice relative to real life today. For example, in Kansas, there are essentially no requirements for home schoolers, including no record keeping, testing, or required subjects. <a href=""http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp?State=KS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp?State=KS</a>",1187636806

3205666,comment,3204161,3205369,1,0,vilya,,,"Lex and Flex both generate C (Flex has an option to output C++ instead, IIRC), yes. There are similar tools for other languages though: Java has JLex, ANTLR, etc. for example.<p>Re: the config file - how often does it change? Does it really need to be deferred to runtime, or is it just startup time? My (probably out-of-date) understanding of rewrite rules in apache, for example, is that you need to bounce the server for it to pick up changes; that would also be sufficient for it to pick up changes to the flex file and rebuild. Running flex and compiling the output is quick enough to be instantaneous from the point of the admin restarting a server.<p>If it really can change at runtime, I guess the point is to avoid downtime while updating the configuration? There are ways around this too, some more practical than others. If your servers are behind a load balancer you can do a rolling restart to pick up changes. If that's not an option it's possible, though probably not trivial, to hot-patch the native code. YMMV. :-)",1320659887

The impression I get from previous posts on this is that the utility of Obj-C is closely tied to the functionality provided by the (proprietary) Cocoa platform.<p>Since there are so many developers from outside the Apple ecosystem learning Obj-C in order to develop for iOS, is there any signs of a movement in the other direction? Are developers who don't think of themselves as purely Mac/iOS developers trying to take Obj-C back with them to other platforms?<p>Posts about how great or poor Obj-C is as a language are kind of irrelevant really as long as it's (effectively) the mandatory language for development on Apple platforms, and isn't much used beyond that. In that situation there are no choices to be made based on opinions about the language's merits or flaws, so they are largely moot.",1320659645

You'll still do so from time-to-time, but ultimately I think people will sit on a platform and just have content after content delivered to them. And already, the newsfeed nature of the web has started down this path. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, HN - they're all feeds of information, some with primitive filtering methods.<p>Partly related, or maybe not, I just wanted to share a piece of advice my grand-father gave to me regarding ""media manipulation"". To add some context, he was a small-town mayor in an East-European communist country in the 1960s. He really believed in Communism. Anyway, he told me that I should always ""read the newspapers endorsed by the Government/official establishment"", this way ""I'll always know what's about to really happen, or anyway, what the powers-that-be want to get happen"".<p>Strangely enough, it was really good advice. For example I watched this in action during the current Greece debt debacle, with The Economist (an establishment magazine) advising for a haircut on the Greek debt at least one or two months earlier than their CDS spread going through the roof, and at least one year earlier than the haircut actually happening.

Which country is supposed to retain the tax on profit on each iPhone sold? The point of sale-country is one alternative. Is it the most logical? Is it equitable and fair (whatever that means)?<p>Second, if your local legislator is just too stupid - or, more accurately, for a lot of reasons - unwilling to close tax loopholes, why on earth should a company be willing to waste shareholder's money by settling a claim (tax) that is not legally binding due to existing loopholes? There is a lot of hypocrisy involved in politicians blaming companies for using tax law loopholes - if they were at all serious about that, they would just write better laws.

Raskin is sourced several times for that chapter.  The Macintosh would have been a very, very different product if Jobs had not taken over, and demanded a very different system than the one Raskin had envisioned.<p>The Issacson Analysis (backed up by Atkinson) was that Raskin had envisioned an underpowered, less expensive system that would not have had many of the features that made the original Macintosh ""Insanely Great.""<p>I like Gladwell's analysis - Jobs was a great _editor_  He didn't necessarily create very much, but he was driven to relentlessly critique until something great emerged.<p>It's amazing how valuable a function that can be, particularly in the presences of great engineers who can rise to the challenge.<p>The reason people praise Steve Jobs is not because he designed anything (though he may have had a few design suggestions) - but because his singular drive to release great products resulted in so many being created (and then, quite logically, being copied by everyone else)<p>The Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad all came about because of Steve Jobs, and have changed the technology that we use every day.

Need nice query capability also which mongo db was good provided.<p><br/>

Mongo seems ideal for this, but I don't needs its performance, and want durability and the ability to run the odd query which covers more data than fits into RAM, without completely falling over.<p>Right now, the alternative is to do something like the following in Postgres, and have the application code extract a few things from the JSON and duplicate them into database columns when I insert data.<p><pre><code>  CREATE TABLE collected_data(
    source_node_id TEXT NOT NULL,

I know what I want when I see it. I also know good stuff. I am sure most people are the same way too.<p>The main difference between us and Jobs is; we do not have the patience to wait until it it is right. The heart to tell 64 (!!!) nurses that they do not fit. The authority to tell geniuses their work suck and they should come back with more designs.<p>He was willing to be rude, difficult and a bully to get it right.<p>Are you?",1320656697

For some reason, a lot of the press is giving him credit for everything at Apple in spite of his infamous reputation for taking credit for other people's work.<p>Jef Raskin said these things in regards to the Macintosh project:<p>""What I proposed was a computer that would be easy to use, mix text and graphics, and sell for about $1,000. Steve Jobs said that it was a crazy idea, that it would never sell, and we didn't want anything like it. He tried to shoot the project down.""<p>""After he took over, Jobs came up with the story about the Mac project being a 'pirate operation.' We weren't trying to keep the project away from Apple, as he later said; we had very good ties with the rest of Apple. We were trying to keep the project away from Jobs' meddling. For the first two years, Jobs wanted to kill the project because he didn't understand what it was really all about.""<p>""I was very much amused by the recent Newsweek article where he [Jobs] said, 'I have a few good designs in me still.' He never had any designs. He has not designed a single product. Woz designed the Apple II. Ken Rothmuller and others designed Lisa. My team and I designed the Macintosh. Wendell Sanders designed the Apple III. What did Jobs design? Nothing.""",1320656508

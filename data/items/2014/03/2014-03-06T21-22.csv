This is much less than the proposed 4.7-billion-dollar Jupiter Europa Orbiter [1], and also less than the already very much slimmed-down &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; concept [2] with a price tag of $1.5 billion or so. For reference, the Mars Science Laboratory mission cost about $2.4 billion.<p>With a sub-billion dollar budget, the achievable science objectives would be severely limited. It would probably still be worth it -- these days we have to take what we&#x27;re given.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Jupiter_System_Mission"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Jupiter_System_Mission</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper</a>",1394143195

We are actually profitable on every virtual server that we sell.<p>The reason we raised our seed round is that our growth began to outstrip our ability to acquire hardware and grow the business at the rate at which our customers were spinning up more droplets.<p>The second round that we raised was again for the same reason.

We hired a babysitter through care.com but on the days when she is not available, we have to find a backup. If you didn&#x27;t plan the backup in advance, you are screwed. For example, our babysitter suddenly could not come for 2 days as her hubby got food poisoning and needed her to stay home with him.<p>So in theory, an &quot;Uber for babysitting&quot; sounds like a good idea where the &quot;on-demand&quot; part is the key. However, the biggest issue I see with something like this is the &quot;trust factor&quot;. Babysitters are a very personal thing because they are responsible for the <i>most</i> important thing in your life i.e. your kid. So, when we hire a babysitter traditionally, we do our due diligence, check references etc. and then build trust over time during their first few weeks/months of work. Example, our current babysitter is now with us for about 3 months and we are just about beginning to trust her. We still don&#x27;t leave her completely alone with our baby (wife staying home for now) but soon, we have to do that. For on-demand, how will this work ? Can I trust someone &quot;uber&quot; like ?

This drastically reduces concerns and issue when refactoring the code base because if the tests are still passing the changed code has, with high probability, not introduced bugs.

Only a few tests are fast enough to run 12B tests within a few minutes.<p>Really, I think the problem is that unit test frameworks are currently incapable of doing the right testing.<p>Unit tests take quadratic time. That is, each new test requires running all previous tests, to get the green. And at some point, a project will have enough tests that it can&#x27;t finish in 10-15s.<p>One option is to mark &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; tests. Another is to recategorize them as &quot;unit&quot; vs. &quot;functional&quot; tests.<p>These are poorly-defined labels. In this case, the 4.5 minutes of testing is &quot;slow&quot;, yes, but it only needs to be run when a specific, small part of the code changes. The problem is, there&#x27;s no way to determine that automatically. The test runner can&#x27;t look at the previous test execution path and see that nothing has changed, and there&#x27;s no way to mark that a test should only be run if code in functions X, Y, or Z of module ABC has changed.<p>Humans are able to figure this out. Well, sometimes. And with lots of mistakes. Get the unit test framework to talk with a coverage analysis tool, plus some static analysis and perhaps a few annotations, and this discussion of how to distinguish one set of tests from another disappears.<p>Blue-sky dreams. I know. :)<p>In real life we toss those functions into their own library, note that the code is static, and do the full test suite only occasionally; mostly when the compiler changes.<p>In other words, bypass CI the same way one does any other third party library.

7356571,comment,7350265,7352894,2,0,mhartl,,,"Softcover is based on the Rails Tutorial model, which differs from Leanpub in several key ways. I actually think Leanpub is a great service if it meets all of your needs as an author, and in fact if it had met all of <i>my</i> needs I might not have bothered building Softcover. (Of course, Leanpub didn&#x27;t exist when I first started publishing the Rails Tutorial in 2009, but I might have used it for follow-on products.) Here are some of the important differences:<p>- <i>Softcover comes with an industrial-strength, open-source production system.</i> This means you can write heavily formatted books with cross-references, code listings, tables, etc., and interactively build them locally, all without being locked in to a proprietary system.<p>- <i>Softcover&#x27;s HTML books are first-class citizens.</i> The online version of the Rails Tutorial is a key part of its marketing strategy, so it has to be polished and prominent.<p>- <i>Softcover gives you your customer list.</i> Letting customers opt-in to share their email is fine for more casual authors, but it isn&#x27;t ideal if (like me) you&#x27;re trying to build a business.<p>- <i>Softcover supports custom domains.</i> It&#x27;s important to me to use a custom domain for branding/SEO and so that I own my own traffic.",1394139857

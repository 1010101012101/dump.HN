Even early into that adventure, I remember hearing about how cold and unfriendly Seattle people were.  I recall an article in a local rag, probably the Stranger, lamenting that people were lonely in Seattle because nobody would talk to strangers.<p>One small contrary datapoint: on my first visit to Seattle from Boston where I was living, I was walking on a downtown city street, uncrowded at the time, and an ordinary passerby made eye contact and said &quot;hi&quot;.  I almost stopped in my tracks, that interaction would have <i>never</i> happened in Boston at the time.  There, it seemed that all strangers in public were to be perceived as threats (probably beggars) unless there was evidence to the contrary. This sort of (perceived) general friendliness was partially what motivated me to move there, that along with the mountains+water and being able to drive 20 minutes from downtown and being in the country.

She sat and read the code for a while until she found the problem. Without any more detail, it seems likely enough that Arnie was setting the vision/direction and providing motivation. They just didn&#x27;t reach their goal before (relatively uninvolved) Martha figured things out.<p>Not trying to devalue Martha&#x27;s contribution. I love the Marthas in my workplace. But, very often, they&#x27;re not leaders. They&#x27;re the people leaders know to turn to in times of crisis. They&#x27;re extraordinarily valuable, and should be compensated/lauded accordingly, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re the leaders. Nor, in my experience, do they always wish to be.<p>Note: Martha did, of course, &quot;set the direction&quot; at the end of the meeting, when she&#x27;d found the bug. But I take direction-setting to generally be an event prior to the activity (in this case, debugging). Martha did not do that.",1398586775

It would be fairly simple to simulate the effect in any game with VR goggles.<p>A really weird effect I&#x27;ve tried is to reverse the images each eye sees. I did this (first unintentionally, then deliberately) with my 3D television. It inverts the depth perception, so a small object in the foreground looks like it&#x27;s sunken deep into the background. But mostly it&#x27;s just confusing and stressful on the eyes, since there&#x27;s presumably no evolutionary preparation to make sense of such visual input. Someone should make a physical optical device to offer this effect in the real world (it probably already exists).",1398586532

There are cases where having more on screen is useful and actually helps readability, in particular for technical and scientific documentation.<p>Reading an article or a story is pretty much a linear activity: you progress onward and never have to go backward. In that case, readability is very much influenced by a page layout that reduces noise.<p>For other types of documentation, the surroundings of what you are reading are important, and having to actually move the page up/down or flip pages on a book makes you easily loose context.<p>So maybe this n-column reflow is not for everything or everyone, but if it was an option available in my browser, I know I would use it quite often.<p>Another thing to note: newspapers and magazines have multiple columns of text, and they are still very readable. So that n-column layout in a browser might not even be bad for reading articles on website that don&#x27;t have busy side panels.",1398586289

It&#x27;s in those languages that you tend to see argument-less functions like Draw() because the entire concept of what it is for that object to be drawn as well as where has been baked in to one large composite object.<p>In languages that place more emphasis on type deduction and composition it&#x27;s much more likely you&#x27;re calling draw to tell it what to draw on, and the aggregate type information once you introduce an argument or two is actually quite rich.<p>Which leaves you with things like Close(), which, let&#x27;s be honest, we don&#x27;t need 30 interfaces that all just have Close in them just because the base language didn&#x27;t happen to include one.

I have tried citrate and orotate forms and while they were both good, compared to malate the effect was mild. The malate form of magnesium had a better calming effect on the mind and muscles. \nWill try L threonate next time and see how it works.<p><a href=""https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/</a>",1451761170
10827353,comment,10826838,10826838,0,0,ThomPete,,,"The problem with any discussion about inequality is that it ends up discussing the rich rather than wealth. This turns the discussion into a moral one which destroy any possibility of discussing this rationally.<p>First. It often creates two groups. The 1% and the rest and then go on to discuss trickle down effect. While it&#x27;s in fact true that trickle down proportionally does not work with the 1% it does work with a lot of other people who create wealth and invest them into other things which then in return creates jobs much more proportional to their wealth (but still of course not in any 1 to 1 relationship)<p>Second. A lot of time discussions about the rich ends up being about their moral compass and their intentions to avoid paying taxes rather than about how they became rich and then look for any weakness in the system which allow for extreme richness (if any)<p>Third. In any discussion about how to tax the uber rich, tax avoidance and lobbying often ends up being the focal point. What I would like to suggest is instead we look at extreme wealth as a function primarily fueled by technology and globalization and then further down the list politics, network etc.<p>I.e. many of the people who are extremely rich today are so because they benefitted from technology and globalization happening at the right time for them not because they somehow worked the system fraudently to become rich (some of course did use it more than others but often also end up being rich much shorter time)<p>Extreme wealth is a function of the system not just the choice and skills of individuals. Someone will become the richest and their richness will be highly influenced by the system they operate in. Since this system is primarily technological and technology moves faster than legislation the job isn&#x27;t to figure what rules to implement/remove/adjust but rather how to do it fast enough and still without killing the ability for growth.<p>But this wont happen until the economist who advice governments acknowledging technology as part of the equation instead of treating it as an externality as they do now.<p>And so why I have nothing against people getting rich (heck I hope to be so one day myself) trying to defend it like PG does here strikes me as extremely limited in how to understand the issues with inequality.",1451761161

10827349,comment,10826836,10827145,0,0,wpietri,,,"I strongly disagree. As an entrepreneur and a mentor, to me a startup is just a new business that is pioneering something new.<p>Most new businesses are replicating an existing business model. E.g., if you open a new corner store, it&#x27;s probably going to end up being like every other corner store. If you&#x27;re starting a games company, you&#x27;re probably going to end up like a bunch of other games companies.<p>Startups, on the other hand, are tackling something deeply innovative. That means early on you have to optimize for learning: understanding customers, iterating on product, seeking product-market fit. It&#x27;s a very different set of behaviors for the entrepreneurs than the normal new business.<p>I think you&#x27;re thinking of <i>venture-backed</i> startups, which require a large enough amount of high-risk capital that nobody will fund them unless they expect to be worth $100m+. But there are plenty of smaller startups that are self-funded or bootstrapped. They can be perfectly stable at small scale, although many of them do choose to grow substantially.",1451761135

Again, no.<p>The thing to remember is that wild populations are still subject to selective pressure, even with &quot;driven&quot; genes. If a gene is introduced that makes an individual incapable of reproduction, that will have no long-term effect. Even if the handicapped genetics can be spread widely through the population, it will disappear within a generation, while non-handicapped genetics will thrive.

Maybe it is high taxes on the ultra-rich, maybe it is an unwillingness to allow high CEO salaries, maybe it is a serious estate tax, etc. Is it really true that Gates, Zuckerberg, Page, Brin, etc. were motivated primarily by money to found Microsoft, Facebook, Google, etc.? If they had a 99% marginal tax rate once they have assets of $500M (on any form of gaining wealth), would we have a weaker Microsoft or Facebook or Google doing less good for the world because they wouldn&#x27;t be working as hard? Would the good done to people on the lower end of the scale not outweigh any possible harm here? That seems hard to imagine.<p>And it is precisely because these people <i>could</i> be less rich that the comparison to racism feels ill-placed. A society biased against people of a particular race cannot make existing people cease being of that race, and preventing new people of that race would be grossly immoral.

If the pie were equally divided, everyone would get a slice of the same size, so the top 1 percent would get 1 percent of the pie. In fact, they get a very big slice, about a fifth of the entire pie.

I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it out.<p>However, if some constructive criticism is permitted, I have to say that, having written distributed applications for many years, I have come to dislike the &quot;classical&quot; push/pop queue data model:<p>* Acking is a bad idea. It requires the broker to manage a lot of state, including locking and timeouts.<p>* Re-queuing invalidates total ordering.<p>* On the performance side, parallel distributed queue consumption (which also breaks total ordering) is directly at odds with this model.<p>* Queues as opaque objects — you can only inspect by popping the top message, and you cannot access older, dequeued messages. Fortunately, Disque allows you to read the entire queue without mutating it, but it doesn&#x27;t look like you can read old messages.<p>* Complicated queue topologies (fanouts, dead letter queues, etc.) become a logical necessity of the strict FIFO structure. (These topologies need to be declared every time the client starts up, and introduces the possibility of schema conflicts.)<p>* Logical de-duping is probably not possible.<p>Apache Kafka gets the data model right. It wisely acknowledges that queues are linear and should stay that way: In Kafka, queues are strictly append-only logs where every consumer has a cursor to the last position it read. In this model, many of the classical concerns melt away: Acks/nacks are unnecessary (consumers simply &quot;commit&quot; their position); total ordering is always preserved (since the queue cannot be reordered) and parallelism is made explicit (through named partitions); de-duping is trivial, and complicated topologies are largely eliminated (AMQP-type &quot;exchanges&quot; that fan out to separate queues are unnecessary because multiple readers can all consume the same queue without changing it, as their position is independent of the queue); and you get to choose either at-most-once or at-least-once delivery consistency by how carefully you manage your offset.<p>Since logs are strictly linear, you are also given the choice of how much history to keep — all of it, if you want — which opens up some interesting use cases that are not possible with classical brokers.<p>Kafka isn&#x27;t perfect. It&#x27;s a huge pain if you&#x27;re not in Java land. There are no modern, mature &quot;high-level&quot; client implementations for Go, Ruby or Node.js. Its reliance on the JVM and on ZooKeeper makes it fairly heavyweight, both on the server and on the consumer side (the new API for broker-stored offsets simplifies things, but non-Java clients are far behind). I would really love to have a lighter-weight, language-agnostic Kafka-like implementation without the Java baggage.<p>Last point: The fact that Disque calls its messages &quot;jobs&quot; makes me a little disappointed that it is, in fact, not a job management system. I&#x27;d love a solid, distributed job manager.",1451759651

But it&#x27;s less clear what&#x27;s happening with opportunity.<p>Networks tend to be winner-take-all, which means that technology actually depletes opportunity at the same time as it increase ability.

Also missing is an analysis of the role of rent seeking in increasing inequality. Basically there is a fundamental division in factors of inequality: which are related to the self serving manipulations of the political and economic system by rich people to sustain their position and which are related to innovation by the best entrepreneurs? Then we must also analyze which of these factors are dominant in our environment. He avoids these essential questions so this essay is just opinion. \nThere are some aspects of our situation that make it seem rent seeking is dominant: low productivity growth, stock buy back games by companies rather than investment, a slowing down of new business formation (which can be caused by monopolies).

Unicode was a response to this.<p>The half way point envisaged by the original Unicode design was to firmly establish a single overall &quot;character set&quot; view with a handful of encodings.<p>Imo we&#x27;ve arrived at this half way point.<p>-----------------------------------------<p>On the string types of languages:<p>Programming languages designed before Unicode emerged adopted the &quot;byte=character&quot; view to determine the character unit of their default string type, leaving higher level views to library code and functions. This is the level Python began at. But the more established Unicode becomes, the more important the higher level views become.<p>Newer languages have mostly been designed to optimize for Unicode&#x27;s half way point (but not the eventual destination). They typically support the byte view in some form but adopt the &quot;codepoint=character&quot; view to determine the character unit of their default string type. Aiui, this is where Python 3 is at.<p>A handful of newer languages continue to support the byte and codepoint views in some form but have adopted the highest level &quot;grapheme=character&quot; view for the character unit of their default string type. I think the most visible new language that&#x27;s been forward-thinking enough to adopt the final destination view (grapheme=character) is Swift.<p>-----------------------------------------<p>[1] Folks trying to understand this point should find it helpful to start with the deceptively brief hint  inherent in <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#Grapheme"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#Grapheme</a> which defines &quot;what a user thinks of as a character&quot;.<p>Next, I&#x27;ll quote the perluniintro[2] document:<p>> A Unicode logical &quot;character&quot; can actually consist of more than one internal actual &quot;character&quot; or code point. For Western languages, this is adequately modelled by a base character (like LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A ) followed by one or more modifiers (like COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT ). This sequence of base character and modifiers is called a combining character sequence. Some non-western languages require more complicated models, so Unicode created the grapheme cluster concept, which was later further refined into the extended grapheme cluster.<p>[2] <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/perluniintro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldoc.perl.org/perluniintro.html</a>",1451758133

Though it might be hard during the transition to remember which sites have the updated key.<p>Not having a database certainly has its downsides.<p>Re usability: I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple days now, and I find it pretty tolerable. It&#x27;s nice to not have to memorize a new password when I sign up for something. I did change my master key once; it took about 5 minutes to update all my passwords. If you only do that once every few months or once a year, it&#x27;s not so bad.",1419850751

Chess is played with 32 figures on a 64-tile board, and that&#x27;s enough to give us serious problems. Games like SC or LoL have way, way more options -- the set of all possible game states is of such a size that I don&#x27;t even have a sense of scale for this order of magnitude.<p>Think about it this way: the average branching factor of a legal chess move is 35: there are about 35 legal moves that could follow. For Go, the average branching factor is 250. In StarCraft, how many &quot;legal moves&quot; do you have available at a given game state, on average? Tens of thousands? Millions?<p>By the way, this is made significantly more difficult by SC and LoL not being turn-based games the way Chess is.",1419850463

This was very stunning for me coming from a country where the temperature rarely drops below 0 degrees Celsius. I have learnt that the Canadians only feel like they are being eco-friendly because the only place they are comparing themselves with is the US.

8809292,comment,8808490,8809080,0,0,techrat,,,"Also keep in mind that Indians also largely only wore leather. Leather is renowned for its great insulative properties.<p>The other factor is wind exposure. It&#x27;s easier to stay tolerant of cold when there&#x27;s no wind. When that wind picks up and starts stripping you of your heat layer, you&#x27;ll feel it much more even at slightly warmer temps.<p>I grew up in a part of the country that almost never gets cold and moved to chicago. First two years were rough. Got a (black dyed motorcycle style) leather jacket and learned to dress in less, but tighter layers. Haven&#x27;t had a problem since. Too many poofy layers is more air that needs to be heated and kept heated by your body. Only times I have an issue is when skin is directly exposed. Even a thin cotton shawl is enough to keep the bodyheat layer more protected.<p>As I got more used to the winters, I also found it more comfortable to keep the temperatures lower indoors. I get nauseous when I&#x27;m outside and it&#x27;s freezing and I step into a store or building that is heated above mid 70&#x27;s. That constant warm up, cool down, warm up cycle of walking in and out of buildings in the city is more taxing than simply dealing with the cold.<p>With that in mind, I found it more comfortable to walk into my apartment as long as it was mostly just warmer than outside rather than the usual indoor temps people are used to. 62 degree (Fahrenheit) indoor average temp is quite easily adjusted to as long as skin isn&#x27;t exposed elsewhere on the body.<p>Now I find I don&#x27;t sleep as well if my pillow gets too warm. I have a pillow on my bed that I swap out with the other and when I do, I make sure it touches the wall so it&#x27;s as cold as it can get when I swap them out again.<p>I did this in my late 20s, early 30s... so I don&#x27;t think it would be a case of not being able to do this if you were older, training yourself to acclimate to colder temperatures.",1419850456

The protection was hidden in the dialog engine. So you were not seeing the actual code, but the interpreter of dialogs actually interpreting the protection in the dialog engine (that was a super simple interpreter, more like a state machine). In the end, it was just a matter of understanding the dialog data and extracting the answer to the protection question (&quot;on page 34, what is the third word ?&quot;).<p>I also cracked some football game by writing a program that would intercept disk access and the replay the disk-errors to cheat it. An emulation layer if you like.<p>The games that I&#x27;ve never cracked were Elite 2 frontier (the damn thing had checks all over the place and that was too hard); &quot;le manoir de mortevielle&quot; had super nasty decryption stuff. IIRC they were running decrypting code inside the interrupt table (so if you had to use the keyboard or timer to trace the code, then woosh :-)).

There are, in fact, flaws in an all JavaScript bookmarklet solution, as the site you&#x27;re visiting can snoop your JavaScript data structures and could readily figure out your master password. This is resolved by use of a Google extension that does not share a JavaScript interpreter with the page you&#x27;re visiting; and it&#x27;s reportedly been fixed in the bookmarklet version of SuperGenPass though I haven&#x27;t read it to see how it is resolved.<p>But, your suggestion of a JS function that take the domain and secret key is how the GenPass and SuperGenPass bookmarklets have worked for years (and the flaw in that method has only been fixed this year, I think).",1419847221

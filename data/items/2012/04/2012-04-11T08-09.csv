3826551,comment,3826364,3826364,18,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"I have conflicting feelings about this. The low-level programmer is disappearing because the abstraction layers are getting better, which means the complexity we deal in is ""how do I get a 30 machine cluster to map-reduce efficiently"" instead of ""how do I optimize these instructions so I don't blow out my L1 cache"".<p>But...all abstractions in computing are leaky, and not having an understanding of lower levels of abstraction <i>will</i> come back to bite you.<p>The simplest example is floating point: how many pennies have been mis-appropriated because a developer used a float instead of a fixed-decimal number. If you understand how the underlying floating point abstraction leaks, you would never use an IEEE float for anything requiring exact decimal values; if not, you feel comfortable using the native type that has the ability to represent decimal values. You don't need to actually know how the float is represented to achieve that.<p>The real trick is understand how much of each layer of abstraction you need to know. A generalist needs to know enough about computer architecure, the network stack, security, etc., that he knows when he either needs to consult an expert (Google often counts ;) or when he is ok to rely on that abstraction, but if you try to learn too much, well, you aren't a generalist anymore.<p>Great generalists are, by definition, great at figuring that out. As a result, they are incredibly valuable because they are really good at just getting stuff done.",1334133796

One comparatively harmless recent example: one politician got caught for cheating on her PhD (copying stuff). So she lost her job in parliament, but next she was offered a job as ""science relations adviser"" for the European parliament (especially her who had just betrayed the institutions of science) - a slap in the face of the honest population.<p>The pirate party promised to represent the real people, it is written in their genes that they want to prevent politicians being politicians just for the sake of power. For example the discussions sometimes go so far that they think their representatives in parliament should only act like puppets executing the decisions made by online votes.<p>Whether they'll manage to deliver is another question, but they don't claim to have all the answers and their intentions are pure.<p>The thing is, that lack of answers is often held against them. But if you think about it, the other parties don't have the answers either. They just stumble through blunder upon blunder (for example dealing with the financial crisis). It's just a human fallacy to assume somebody who takes a firm stance is also competent (this was even shown in psychological experiments).",1334133704

If this is really how they want to play it, I wish them all the best. (If this really is the case, I find the current copy on their website a bit misleading, though).<p>On the other hand, if their goal is to establish a vibrant open source community around meteor, then I think they are on the wrong track.<p>To accomplish that you need to have a low barrier of entry for a) users of your product and b) contributors to your project.<p>The GPL, in the case of a web-framework that blurs the client-server divide, sets the bar quite high for both groups:<p>a) Other commenters seem to agree with me that every app developed with a GPL'ed meteor has to be put under GPL as well. The implications alone might drive some people away from using meteor, but even having to think about those things upfront can be discouraging. Some people do not like the GPL, some may not be able to work with it and some may simply want to be able to choose the license for their work themselves.<p>b) If they are offering a commercial license, it will not be easy for them to accept outside code contributions. They need to establish some legal documents (Contributor Agreements, maybe Copyright Assignments) and a process for accepting contributions. This makes it a lot harder to contribute than simply sending a pull request. They cite the MySQL business model as something they closely studied. MySQL has a particulary bad reputation for not accepting outside contributions. And this is mainly due to their dual-licensing model.<p>I strongly believe that Ruby on Rails became popular so quickly and still has an active community because of its liberal license (MIT).<p>Personally I am very excited about meteor and I wish that they reconsider using another license. It does not have to be MIT, even though that is what I would choose, but even LGPL would be better IMHO.",1334133645

In one part, you argue a name should hint what it does, but on another, a name needs to be flexible to the long term strategy. The great companies often follow the latter, not the former.

For one thing the other parties will take over some of their positions (especially the Green and the Liberal).

And they still have internal quarrels which will become stronger if they gain power and may eventually break the party (hopefully not). There is a slight hype about them at the moment, but this will cool down. And then there will be a time, when the main struggles about internet freedom cools down and there are agreements and laws made (this will somehow never end finally, but it won't matter that much anymore). That's a similar situation as the Green party had to face many years ago, when they had managed to establish laws to protect the environment.<p>On the long run I see them around 8 to 10 percent, depending on region (more in cities) and which positions they take in areas like education, finances, taxes...

This means it is distributed (or conveyed) to the user. Thus, you have to offer every user of the app a possibility to obtain the unobfuscated source code.<p>But there is more: The GPL requires you to offer not only some JS files, but everything needed to run the application.

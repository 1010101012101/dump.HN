3039469,comment,3033385,3039173,1,0,ohashi,,,"Out of curiosity, can you describe what sort of 'deep wisdom' you think isn't/cannot be passed along?  It's a rare thing to be deeply moved by what someone is saying (at least in my experience), but I don't think the times I've truly been moved by information being imparted on myself is exclusive to the realm of 'real life.'  There are wonderful movies, books, even conversations I've had that have had profound impacts on me as a person.  I am not sure if perhaps you think this isn't possible or we are thinking about fundamentally different experiences?<p>I actually thought about this point when I wrote my response, that perhaps it may be limited to the past hundred or two hundred years.  However, I am not sure if that's the case or not, I don't know enough history/sociology to make any sort of qualified statement on the subject.  The pace at which technological change is happening has certainly increased since the industrial revolution, and I presume that has been a major driver of cultural change as well.<p>I am still not really sure what you mean by learning form clueless peers.  It isn't as if all the elders in a society disappeared - most children still go to school, have parents, get jobs, are exposed to role model figures.  In fact what do you think of most western countries where population is actually getting older and there is a lack of young people?",1317052733

Basically I'm doing this because I want to stay up to date with the tech scene, but I can't afford to surf all the blogs (incl. HN) multiple minutes/hours per day. That's why I created www.hackingfresh.com - a daily tech newsletter.<p>The idea is that you sign up  for a daily newsletter, which arrives around 6pm GMT+1, and get up to 20 interesting stories with a little comment by me (describing the story). If you're interested you can dive in, if not, you just skip the story and read the interesting ones. This service costs you 0.50 $ a day, not one penny more (See Edit 2, newsletter is now FREE!)<p>I kinda got the idea also by Gary Vaynerchuk (http://garyvaynerchuk.com/post/166652911) who names this the ""DJ Business"" and Peter Cooper, who was looking for a daily podcast with the most interesting stories of the day (still searching for the exact tweet).<p>If you have any questions, email me (email in profile) or ask here directly.<p>Edit: As requested a sample email I put together for today: http://hackingfresh.com/?page_id=19. Like I said, not much content from my side, I just get the most interesting and most compelling stories into one easy digestible format.<p>Edit 2: Newsletter is now FREE and will officially start tomorrow (will be startup-ad-supported!).",1317052724

Amazon didn't make money right away either, but just because Google and Amazon started making money doesn't mean that <i>every</i> internet startup will become Google or Amazon. Twitter should have been making money for some time now; it's absolutely ludicrous that they aren't.<p>If Tumblr is really getting 10 billion page views, what are they waiting for? I don't understand where the money comes from to throw into these projects that have no track record of profitability.<p>To put it another way, would investors pour $85 million of new investment into Burger King tomorrow? How about Sears? These are companies with massive revenue and decades of profit and investors would be hard pressed to just hand them millions - when companies like Burger King get money, it's with terms, i.e., loans to build new locations.<p>Juxtaposed against handing Tumblr $85 million just so they can afford to keep their servers going is incredibly silly.",1317052413

We called the project Bella at first, because we wanted to create something beautiful.<p>The whole thing is about location. While there are loads of travel blogging platforms out there already, our USP is that the focus of the site is a map, and hence the ordering of information is done geographically instead of chronologically, which makes more sense when you are travelling. If your friend goes to Peru, the most important thing is not the exact date he went there, but the fact that it is Peru! And you want to have a look around the area on a map, and see some other places he went nearby etc... A story and patterns begin to emerge. Nothing else out there gives you the ability to view geotagged information in such a beautiful format.<p>You only really have 2 pages: your dashboard and your blog (other things like changing your settings and writing blog posts are done in the sidebar). The dashboard shows all the map routes / blog posts of the people you are following, with all the newest info at the top, kinda like the facebook news feed. Your blog page shows just your map route and your blog posts, ordered by the date you did things on your trip, so it reads like a story.<p>After you register, you can (read: will be able to) search for your friends and follow them, which will make their map routes/blog posts appear on your dashboard. Your friend's map routes/pins will appear in different colours and overlap each other and hopefully look really cool. To get people started, we give them a link to a ""featured"" blog, to see what one looks like.<p>Feedback would be great. Please send any thoughts to rayhan@globev1.com",1317049690

Yet most claim they have no need of maths.<p>Programming need not be taught for its own sake. It could be an enabler together with maths. A tool for exploring concepts. A lot of maths is difficult because it is so far from everyday concepts. So it takes a great deal of effort to supply the materials needed to build the supporting mental models. von Nuemann said ""In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them"". One way is to drill lots of problems but this is boring and only a few people are disciplined enough to do it. Another way is to program the concept (all the maths an average person needs is finite, algorithmic and constructive), explore lots of variations, improve intuition, give a basis of attachment to motivate short quick drills to be able to then improve the model.<p>The power of programming is that it gives you a way to concretize abstract concepts in a virtual setting. Lessening the distance, hence making it more approachable. I have only a little doubt that I can teach a random 10 year old the basics of special relativity up to accounting for acceleration, using programming. And I am certain they would be able to learn Bayesian probability by playing with a programmable model designed to teach it.<p>There is also the added benefit of strengthened analytical thinking. You cannot know how a simple scripting knowledge can help a person without being them. My suspicion is it would help most people in some way.

I was on Friendster in college and then Myspace.  Graduated as Facebook was coming up so I never got the college experience of it.  (God I feel old now, thanks a lot, 19 year-old!)  I think at your age perhaps I didn't care either, but now I do.  I think trivial status updates can mean more than we think and they at least can place where you were at a certain time.  It's a lot of information that could be dangerous in the wrong hands.<p>EDIT: I'm not trying to say that ""you'll change when you grow older,"" rather that's just what happened to me.",1317049270

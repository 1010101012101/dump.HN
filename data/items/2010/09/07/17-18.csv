(Weird, isn't it?)</i><p>I'm almost positive this statement is incorrect.<p>Relativistic force laws tend to be forced to contain correction factors that ensure that constant velocity motion is ""predicted"" and the direction of the force is adjusted accordingly - as long as a body is not accelerating, a purely attractive or repulsive force will be pointing at its current position, <i>not</i> its position 8 mins ago.<p>To see why this must be the case for a repulsive force, at least, imagine two charges riding on frictionless rails that keep them at a constant, finite distance.  Suppose they're both moving with some constant velocity (to start, at least) in the same direction - now the place that the force from the other charge <i>appears</i> to be coming from is behind the charge, so if there was no correction factor, each charge would be getting an extra push forwards.  This would lead to a runaway ""bootstrap"" acceleration, and the particles would accelerate to the speed of light.  That's a pretty clear violation of the conservation laws, so...<p>With attractive forces like gravity, there's still a conservation problem, since the charges would slow down to zero speed eventually, but it's always more convincing to cite the runaway solution as a violation of conservation laws than the run-down one, because while the energy could possibly leak out of the charges into the fields, there's nowhere to pull infinite energy from, so it's pretty clear there's a problem if we'd need to.<p>And this is somewhat different from the runaway self-action solutions that we grudgingly ""accept"" in E+M, because those tend to involve some limit to infinitesimal size, whereas this is a completely finite situation that we could theoretically set up in the real world with a couple of charged beads or something like that.",1283881550

Here is the one passage from <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> where Smith uses the term:<p><i>""He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. ‚Ä¶[H]e intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.  Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.  By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.  I have never know much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good‚Ä¶</i><p><i>""‚Ä¶[E]very individual, it is evident, can in his local situation, judge much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him.  The statesman, who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it.""</i><p>Elepsis's comment highlights a quote from an article about del.icio.us saying that personal benefit comes first and without personal benefit del.icio.us not only would not work, but there would be no substantial public benefit produced.  If anything, this is an even stronger statement than Smith's statement of the 'invisible hand.'<p>Your comment is somewhat of a non-sequitur.  You seem to be attacking the thesis that the market should exist entirely free from the activities of the state.  This has nothing to do with my original comment.  It's irrelevant if the 'invisible hand' metaphor was only used once‚Äîthe fact remains that Elepsis's quote is a very straightforward restatement of the 'invisible hand' metaphor.

Then repeat, pushing it backwards.<p>A bike moving forward will self correct to stay up until it loses speed.  A bike moving backward will quickly go into a hard turn right or left and fall over.  Gyroscopic moments for wheels in both scenarios are the same.  The difference is that as a forward-moving bike falls to one side, the front wheel straightens out underneath it. As a backward moving bike (or any bike with a turning rear wheel), starts to fall, the front (now rear) wheel turns further to the side as it falls rather than straightening out, and the bike goes into a very sharp turn and falls.<p>As an addendum, that's why recumbent bikes stick with a rear drive and front steer, which requires very long chains, rather than driving the front and steering with the rear (which at first blush seems like a much simpler configuration - the pedals are up near the front wheel, and the hands are near the rear).",1283880242

In my opinion, you should always avoid seeing incorrect usage of language when learning. This extension does not properly translate the words in context, it does not provide the proper forms of words that correspond with the subjects/objects (such as masculine/feminine/plural), and sometimes it's completely wrong.  If you learned using this tool, you'd have to unlearn almost as much material as you learned.<p>I think it's much, much more effective to just read a newspaper in the language you want to learn and use a dictionary.  It's not as easy, but you're not going to expose yourself to bad grammar that you'll automatically pick up and have to unlearn later.",1283879141

The first bullet point of the Agile Manifesto is that individuals and interactions matter more than processes and tools.  (See <a href=""http://agilemanifesto.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agilemanifesto.org/</a> if don't know what I'm talking about.)<p>The heart of the Agile movement at the start was that no one process fit all situations.  So they tried to come up with whole families of methodologies exactly so that teams could choose the one that best fit their situation.  Some of those methodologies proved popular.  (eg Scrum.)  Some people made a living out of pushing those.  And voila!  The message became, ""Here is a magic methodology that is right for all situations, which we'll be glad to teach you about in our next expensive seminar!""<p>And so it happens.

The Scrum consultants in my company have been here almost a year.  We know Scrum now.  They still don't understand much about our business or our systems.  Why are they here?  Why do I keep hearing ""<vampire redacted> says I can't do that,"" when <vampire redacted> is just a freaking process consultant who reports to a peer of your boss's boss?  Why do we let them have that kind of power, when they only exercise it to pretend they still have something to teach us so we will keep paying them?<p>Also, the ScrumMaster role attracts the wrong kind of people.  It attracts people who want power and want to be important.  The desire for power conflicts VERY BADLY with being a good ScrumMaster, much worse than being a developer or manager or any other job I can think of.  ScrumMaster is a simple role requiring only a little more process expertise than the chicken or pig roles.  A ScrumMaster is a meeting facilitator.  A ScrumMaster has no authority and no ninja skills.  Being a ScrumMaster is like being the guy who can fix the printer.  Having good ScrumMasters is very, very important, but they are not Important People.  Does that make sense?  They are not managers.  People outside a Scrum team should not treat the ScrumMaster as a decision-maker or the proper conduit of information into the team.  Bad ScrumMasters exploit those habits to aggrandize themselves and try to boss around their teams.  Then they have power without responsibility.",1283878856

We had a prism mirror on a 30,000 RPM motor, a slit lamp (not a laser) and some mirrors.  The narrow bar of light from the slit lamp was aimed at the prism, which reflected the light to a distant mirror, then back to the prism, then onto a target.  The idea is that as the motor RPM increases, the line of light projected onto the target will move slightly, and you can calculate the speed of light from this.<p>We didn&#x27;t have a dark enough or long enough room, and aligning all the mirrors was a huge pain.

Point #1 is bogus: if you&#x27;re already doing a venous draw then why do another separate test as well? That&#x27;s just good sense.<p>The other points don&#x27;t especially surprise me either. They seem mostly like either just a cautious response to learning she&#x27;s a reporter or even standard practice. Many above-board companies who are cautious about their press presence train their employees not to talk to reporters, or to be careful around them, and to report them to the company&#x27;s PR team.<p>Reporters don&#x27;t get everything right, and some have an axe to grind and will twist details to suit their narrative. It&#x27;s normal for companies to attempt to control their interaction with them.<p>This strikes me as a cautious response and doesn&#x27;t even seem especially paranoid to me, or only a little. They have taken really bad press recently and it&#x27;s not unusual for their employees to have been told by this point to be careful around reporters and to notify headquarters.<p>Unfortunately the piece does not include a detail that it would have been really useful to know, which is what happens if you walk in and order the one test that can be conducted with a finger prick - would they use their test or not? The difficulty ordering the test that occurred when she asked could have been affected by the fact that she had told him she was a reporter, and the employees freaked out a bit. Those were low level employees who had presumably not been trained on how to interact with the press, but knew about their company&#x27;s bad situation. I would not recommend reading too much into it.<p>Plus the reporter almost certainly got Theranos&#x27; hackles up by communicating with them and receiving an invitation to have a test done, and then going behind their back to do it anonymously at another center. I won&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s unethical for him to have done that, but it&#x27;s definitely an aggressive action or will seem so to Theranos.",1451187969

You&#x27;ve got a cluster fuck in progress; K seems to be lacking in IT mgmt skills.<p>- regarding reviews, raises, and promotions they can do more or less whatever they want with those and nothing counts until the ink is dry. Nor will anyone who matters give two shits about them 90 days later. None of my big $ moves ever lined up with any review (actually, most of the time it was exactly opposite).<p>- The more pertinent question is &quot;will I be fired&quot; over this?

I&#x27;ve played this game before several times and wind up walking my tormentor out the door.<p>Suggestion: mentally write off the promotion and ignore your review, dismiss all short term noise; focus on things which drive where you will be 12M-24M out. (This is also why I have never protested a review in the past 15 years; nobody gives a shit if you survive).<p>Fun games to play:<p>1) Inform C that you don&#x27;t have enough access to what is going on in K&#x27;s process, due to being excluded from the team lead meetings. Point to this as a source of delays and &quot;confusion&quot;. Do so in writing.<p>2) Get K to put down specs; go ask clarifying questions with appropriate next level mgmt on copy. Gently highlight gaps.<p>3) Ideal time to get creative in how you develop / document solutions on the front end; I would give as little detail as possible to make it harder to fire me.<p>4) Call a meeting of your own, that overlaps the purpose of the meeting she excluded you from. It&#x27;s agenda should be something like requirements validation or solution design. Be nice but indicate you need it to accomplish your goals.<p>What you&#x27;re setting up here is a slow boiling cauldron of incompetence charges again K and yourself as a trusted &quot;competent&quot; source in the app and underlying technology.<p>Move SLOWLY and GENTLY in laying this groundwork; soft innocent questions are best. Be like water...drip drip drip. Slowly wearing away at her credibility and building your own. Maintain emotional control and calm when she lashes out (she will).<p>Look for a new job, of course.

And I recall pointing out that so long as governments have armies that can find ways to be repressive. I recall being down modded as if I was some kind of irrational troll. At that time, and in those forums, the people who got upvoted were the ones who made the argument that the Internet could never be censored, because the Internet would route around censorship as if censorship was a form of network failure. During that era, a lot of people made some fairly naive libertarian/utopian arguments about the Internet was changing the world. Some people still make these arguments even now. There were some places (I&#x27;m thinking of places such as BoingBoing) where the utopian editorial tone was the only tone that was allowed. Places like BoingBoing have gotten much better at documenting the ways that governments are undermining the Internet, but many of these places started off denying that such undermining could ever happen. I am happy that these people finally revised their view of the world, though I wish the dangers had been more widely appreciated at an earlier date.<p>The reality we face is now much as it has always been: there is no technological solution for repression. The only way to establish a free society is to mobilize and fight for it.

JavaScript will be, for the foreseeable future, the king of the web front end, and I suspect it&#x27;ll also hold a strong role on the back end. It may even be unstoppable on both ends because of the incredible resources being thrown at it.<p>However, systems management, deployment, provisioning, data aggregation, log/event analysis, etc. on a large scale becomes more important by the day, and if there is an area where Perl is still quite popular, it is in those back end tasks. There are trendy tools in newer languages, but you&#x27;d be hard press to find very large deployments (at least on Linux or other UNIX) without a few hundred thousand lines of Perl running some elements.<p>Perl 6 with concurrency built-in, grammars and the most advanced regular expression engine in the world, seems very well-suited for that future. Being somewhat familiar for old school sysadmins who&#x27;ve always relied on Perl for their scripting tasks is a bonus (Python has made some inroads in that space in recent years, particularly with Red Hat and Ubuntu/Debian shipping many system utilities that are written in Python).<p>Anyway, on the web front, I think we need a reasonable database abstraction layer (e.g. Perl DBI/DBD), at the very least, before it gets elevated to &quot;always available&quot; on hosting providers.

Furthermore, engineering a lot of AWS services would cost you developer time as well.<p>I consult / contract for a Fortune 50 customer that pays an insane amount of money to AWS per month and it seems ridiculous what they&#x27;re paying for and what they get. But do you know what&#x27;s even more ridiculous? Paying <i>three times as much</i> but getting even worse reliability and a massive amount of time wasted while waiting weeks to provision servers. One group internally used to have massive outages <i>daily</i> resulting in needing to hire a dedicated team of about 6 just to handle that load of production incidents (terrible reliability also resulting in loss of revenue too) and since migrating their software with even the most bone-headed SPF-everywhere AWS based software architecture haven&#x27;t had more than one or two per week for outages now. The cost benefits get better the more incompetent / incapable your internal IT organization is. The amount of wasted resources due to internal bureaucracy, legacy, and working with companies that don&#x27;t really practice any form of technology at scale has been an incredible amount of savings for my customer.<p>And knowing how much my customer relies upon AWS support for the most menial of tasks (primarily a cultural thing with how they treat their vendors as well as internal resources) I am sure that nobody but massive companies that deal with external bureaucracies effectively could deliver the size and kind of support team to handle the volume of support requests generated by my customer for the most ridiculous of tasks (I&#x27;ve seen executives file AWS support requests to reboot VMs at 3 am because the bureaucracy is extremely brittle here and reflects into the software systems reliability). We may throw millions / month at AWS, but Amazon has to hire at least a few dozen engineers and several account managers just to handle support alone which I might argue could be a net loss to handle the customer.<p>Most vendors that work with my customer have a very hard time working with them because they approach sourcing quite similar to how Walmart does and abuses them to the point where the vendors abuse their employees.",1451186231

If you swapped the lightness (e.g. in CIELAB or CIECAM02 color space) from the left and right examples while leaving the hue/chroma the same, you’d get the opposite results inre what looks “good”, which would reveal this “Müller formula” to be bogus (or at any rate radically oversimplified).<p>More generally, I’ve never seen a convincing exposition of similar color preference effects backed by data collected in a scientific paper with reasonable study design.

Bad examples are endemic to the pseudosciency-color-theory genre, because most people work with terrible color models which are only marginally relevant to human perception.<p>The key to making color schemes for graphic illustrations or data visualizations look good is to use enough contrast (especially lightness contrast) between intentionally separate shapes so that distinct elements don’t accidentally blend together.

I don&#x27;t know how much Theranos&#x27; price reduction is dependent on its nanotainer tech, but if someone came in and offered an affordable service like CVS&#x27;s minute clinics, but for tests, I&#x27;d use it, even if they had to do normal draws.",1451185565

Text is something that a majority of applications need to deal with at some point, and a source of hard bugs and security issues when done wrong.  I am thankful for perl&#x27;s influence, but I disregard it as a serious language outside of some niches like ETL and log processing.  I&#x27;m skeptic that perl6 will change that, and there&#x27;s been so much progress elsewhere that failure doesn&#x27;t matter much, but I will wait a couple more years to see how the community responds and take a look at it myself if it pans out.",1451185420

That was neat, because even the least-interested students were semi-comfortable sitting down at one of the UNIX machines).<p>Sorry, not a thing to do with the article, it just sparked a warm memory.

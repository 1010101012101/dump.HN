So let&#x27;s exclude that from the discussion.<p>What if a provider only ran software licensed with the AGPL?  It wouldn&#x27;t fix anything.  The license requires accessing a download of the source.  How can a customer verify the version of the software is the same as the version of the download, i.e. check for a violation of the license?  Short of having access to the operating system on the servers, the customer cannot.  No reasonable service provider would allow such access, and no reasonable customer would accept that other customers, including, possibly, competitors, had such access.<p>You can push the problem around all you like (every customer has their own server with OS-level access, but what about the DB?).  It will always end up being cost prohibitive to run a service.<p>Also, under the AGPL the point is for any user of the system to be able to host and run their own instance.  Meaning that any innovations must be given away.  Conversely, if the software can only run in the context of the provider&#x27;s data store, the problem of data ownership is not resolved.<p>Do I want the keys to the OS on my home computer.  Darn right.  At work, do I want the keys to Amazon&#x27;s virtualization layer?  Heck no, I don&#x27;t want those headaches.

First off, using email internally for communication makes no sense. If you&#x27;re a truly distributed team[1] you use teamspeak, or hangouts, or slack, or IRC, or anything other than email.<p>Second there are no radically different timezones within the US.

The PS4 trackpad isn&#x27;t exactly brilliant, but I can move around the mouse and click on what I want to with some accuracy. Of course, the trackpad on the controller is very small and not very accurate, so it&#x27;s not really practical for artwork or anything.

Embrace the ability to learn and grow by making professional mistakes in an environment where others will point out those mistakes and the team will carry much of your weight while you gain experience.<p>2) When networking and interviewing, don&#x27;t sell yourself on what you know. In the grand scheme, you don&#x27;t know much, and you can&#x27;t win by competing on something that you lack. When I hire Jr. Developers, I don&#x27;t really care what they know or, on the surface, what they&#x27;ve done. I&#x27;m not hiring them for experience or knowledge. I&#x27;m hiring them for their passion and their thirst for knowledge. I&#x27;m making a gamble that the investment that I make into that person is going to pay back 10 times. What matters to me is how willing that person is to admit their weaknesses and to jump at the opportunity to learn. Market yourself accordingly. Focus on networking through whatever local meetups you can find. Ask (or beg) experienced developers in your area to meet you for coffee so that you can pick their brain or ask advice. Always be inquisitive. Do personal projects to challenge yourself. Find the things at the very edge of your ability or comprehension, and challenge yourself to find what lays just beyond. Repeat.<p>3) Show that you&#x27;re committed. Many people disagree with the traditional education system, especially in CS. But, the one thing that it shows is that if you commit yourself to something that you will see it through. That said, I don&#x27;t have a CS degree and a rarely give a shit about a degree for anyone I&#x27;m hiring, but, you need to find some way to demonstrate that commitment. As I said, I&#x27;m going to invest heavily into you. The last thing in the world that I want is someone that three months in suddenly feels like they no longer care, or, worse yet, are now beyond the role.<p>4) On areas where you are knowledgeable, speak your mind. No one wants to hire a limp fish. When I invest in helping you to grow, I&#x27;m going to look to you to help the next young developer grow. That requires someone that is willing to stick up for what they think is the right way to do a thing. But, this specific piece of advice comes with two important caveats. First, don&#x27;t boastfully preach on areas where you are not informed. It&#x27;s called bull-shitting, and those around you will know. And second, however strongly you hold a belief, always remember that as we grow our beliefs will evolve. Don&#x27;t close yourself off from different ideas or opinions.<p>One of the best developers that I ever hired broke down in the middle of a technical interview. We were hammering him about some somewhat advanced Javascript concepts and he couldn&#x27;t provide answers. He was visibly upset and frustrated and clearly felt by the end of the interview that he wouldn&#x27;t be hearing back from us. Before he left, he told me, &quot;You know, I&#x27;m sorry that I got upset. I&#x27;m frustrated that I can&#x27;t answer these questions. But most of all, I&#x27;m frustrated that I&#x27;m not at a place where I can learn to answer these questions.&quot; That was one of the most honest and impactful things I&#x27;ve heard from any candidate and I knew on the spot that he was the right hire. In the last three years that he&#x27;s been on my team, he has gone from limited experience outside of HTML and Javascript, to production quality Ruby, Objective C, and Java development.<p>That&#x27;s what I look for in an inexperienced developer.",1419744912

If you don&#x27;t have actual work experience, create a list of personal projects and describe how you made them.<p>Put as much information on major job sites like Monster, SimplyHired, Indeed, Dice,etc.. It&#x27;s boring and if you don&#x27;t have much to list, disheartening, but likely you&#x27;ll get some recruiters calling you to try to fit you into whatever job de jour they have cooking that day. At least having someone calling though with minor interest helps boost confidence.<p>Apply to small local companies, don&#x27;t bother with huge organizations(e.g. power companies, healthcare). If there is a long drawn out application process on their website, avoid it. Ensure you include a cover letter and customize it to include something about the company, and why you&#x27;d be excited to work for them(e.g. you like their product, and can see how it could make a difference in the world).<p>Get your GED. I think you&#x27;re giving a poor excuse for why you don&#x27;t have it. There are tons of places to take the GED test. Get it at least scheduled and go.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t want to go through the typical education process, jobs won&#x27;t just land in your lap. You&#x27;re likely going to have to work just as hard(or harder) driving yourself towards personal improvement, as you would going through college. It&#x27;s also extremely easy to become apathetic and let your life slip away when your goals are ambiguous. You need to become a specialist. A ton of people in my area are looking for AngularJS programmers. This is probably one of the top requested things recruiters were asking for. To really become a specialist though, you&#x27;d probably need at least a few months dedicated to making serious applications with AngularJS. The market could also fall out from under you as well, and suddenly your specialist skill isn&#x27;t what people need anymore.<p>If you really need money, look for extremely low end jobs that have nothing to do with programming/tech and try to expand your role as the &quot;tech guy&quot; once you get there. Even putting something on your resume like &quot;assisted co-workers with technical problems&quot; and a few stories involving your problem solving skills in the work environment may get you noticed.<p>Go to user groups or tech meets in the area. Try to find out what people are working on, and make them aware you&#x27;re available. Maybe you can pick up odd jobs.<p>Ultimately, if you really cannot find work and you are passionate about programming, swallow your pride, get loans and go to school(community college, then university). Even if you end up with 50 - 60K debt, you WILL be able to pay it off with a professional software developer salary. It&#x27;s probably one of the most worthwhile investments you could make in yourself. Just make sure you network while in school, look for internships, apply for campus tech jobs, and develop a hearty list of personal and school projects.",1419744467

You need to make money somehow. Worst case scenario you go to work at something like LaborReady or Manpower. It&#x27;s exhausting work but if you show up and put in a little effort you&#x27;ll always have work. For a little while I was on a request list for companies that used Labor Ready.

Consider the effect such a law is likely to have after the first two or three school principals are convicted of violating it, and imprisoned accordingly -- as Voltaire put it, <i>pour encourager les autres</i>, and <i>encourager les autres</i> it would! Sufficiently encouraged, they <i>will</i> find a way to solve the problem.<p>Consider further the effect on federal law it is likely to have when it&#x27;s not just a single state which passes and enforces this sort of law, but five, or ten, or twenty -- it worked for marijuana legalization; why not for this purpose as well? And consider how well it might work if, in the fullness of time, parents of bullies are themselves implicated in similar fashion -- granted that schools stand <i>in loco parentis</i>, and no progressive is going to want to roll that back save a few homeschoolers who inhabit the wild-eyed radical leftward fringe of the movement, but a certain judicious revitalization of the concept that parents are responsible for their children&#x27;s behavior seems like something which would have a salutary effect in this case.<p>Culture change is almost of necessity a generational process; legislation is not, especially when you can trivially tar opponents of legislation like this as enablers of bullies and bullies themselves -- tactics which, while perhaps slanderous and certainly unsavory, are well within the progressive playbook, and far from the only pages of that playbook which could be deployed in favor of an effort like the one I describe.<p>I&#x27;m a theorist and a (sloppy) rhetorician, not an activist. I wouldn&#x27;t know where to begin putting together a campaign actually to enact such legislation. But I don&#x27;t see where the idea is intrinsically flawed, and while it lacks the theoretical elegance of extirpating the problem from the roots on up, it most certainly offers the prospect of saving a lot of kids from a lot of beatings, and I think much more quickly and comprehensively, too.",1388699306

It works like this: Imagine that six months have passed, and you haven&#x27;t achieved the body of your dreams. How surprised are you? The less surprised you are, the less likely it is you will succeed at your goal. Then think in detail about each reason you wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if June comes and the number on the scale hadn&#x27;t budged. Each reason—whether &quot;I don&#x27;t have time&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t like running in the mornings&quot;—is a possible cause of failure. Using the surprise level to anticipate these is crucial to creating a plan to address each weak point.&quot;<p>I like this technique a lot. Thinking about how surprised you&#x27;d be if you do not achieve your objective.<p>I think the technique has similarities with the exercise that Steven Covey writes about in &quot;The Seven Habits&quot; where you must think about what you want other people to say about you at your funeral.

Either they have to be selective about what metadata is retained long-term, or they have to buffer everything but only for a short term in which case they are acting very much like a &quot;common carrier&quot; with an exceptionally bad problem of bufferbloat.<p>But either way, there&#x27;s another problem: The data being &quot;searched&quot; isn&#x27;t <i>your</i> data, it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s data (at a different ISP or host) that happens to be bit-for-bit identical to the data you transmitted, which means any 4th Amendment claim would be theirs to make, not yours.

Bayes&#x27; theorem is, as others have mentioned, much nicer when you work with odds rather than probabilities for your prior and posterior probabilities. If you&#x27;re comfortable with logarithms, it&#x27;s nicer still when you work with logarithms of odds. Now you&#x27;re just adding the vector of log-likelihoods to the prior odds vector to get the posterior odds vector.

Having it all in one place is preferable to me.  The second problem with the &quot;good&quot; site is by summarizing feature each plan comes with, rather than being more specific, they are assuming that they know what is important to me.  What if I could care less (and this has happened to me several times) about some big picture feature, and just need the version that provides database X integration?  More clicking, and more likelihood that I buy a higher specced plan that I actually need.<p>And that is where I think these come from.

It was freaking amazing.<p>Sad thing is, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have done it, were I not working for a place that made &quot;unplugging&quot; a condition of my getting a bonus.

Different macronutrients provoke differing endocrinological responses. Our bodies are biological, not mechanical machines, and we process carbohydrates differently than fats or protein. It isn&#x27;t controversial and it shouldn&#x27;t come as a shock. New research is showing that the hormone cascade brought about by certain foods -- and by adipose tissue itself -- has an enormous impact on our health.<p>The problem is that people want to oversimplify nutrition into universal equation which assumes that everyone is the same, and they often cite epidemiological nutritional studies -- notorious for being inaccurate and unreliable -- to do so. The truth is probably more complicated: the diet that keeps one person healthy might make another fat and sick, and it&#x27;s primarily dependent upon genetics, not physics.<p>For more on this, read any of Taubes&#x27;s books.

The same is true for entrepreneurs (and everyone, really). Preventing burnout is part of your job.&quot;<p>Everyone is different and even comparing muscles is not the same.<p>Some people may need to take time off to prevent burnout others may not. I worked 5 or 6 years without a break and didn&#x27;t think anything of it.<p>That said it&#x27;s probably natural to try and elevate oneself when you have some ability that someone else doesn&#x27;t appear to have. Some people do need less sleep (not me) and would almost certainly have an opinion of someone who need more than 8 hours.<p>The thing about &quot;making fun&quot; of other people is that you isolate one thing (that you identify as negative) not everything about them. And there is nothing wrong with trying to perk yourself up because you can do 20 pullups with your feet out while the other guy (who only needs 4 hours of sleep) is focusing on his extra productivity as a way of feeling good about himself..

Outrage at secret courts with no oversight, and national security letters that forbid even revealing details about exactly what and how much information the government has access is absolutely well founded.<p>But getting outraged because spies create spy gadgets is, well, kind of silly. Get outraged when they plant these gadgets on innocent targets, on political targets, on allies, on economic targets, sure.

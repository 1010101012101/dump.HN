5617516,comment,5617423,5617423,16,0,rubyrescue,,,"i've started using Elixir for all my side projects. It's very satisfying to use and as it sits on Erlang/OTP, you get all the power of Erlang, all the libraries, etc. It still means it's not great for math; it's too slow just like Erlang. But it has all the concurrency and stability of Erlang/OTP in a new, sexy, non-prolog language.<p>Further, Jose Valim (the language creator) is incredibly talented as a developer and has made rapid progress in iterating the language, and responds quickly to suggestions. The mailing list is also picking up momentum, folks are contributing ideas for how to make the language great.<p>Yuri (yrashk) has spearheaded the efforts around a package manager - <a href=""http://expm.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://expm.co/</a> which allows all Erlang Rebar packages plus Elixir packages. Still missing is ""binary"" package support but that's been a gripe about Erlang for a long time.<p>I believe in Erlang/OTP and I really believe Elixir has a bright future. In a few years there will be folks who build Elixir apps and don't bother to learn Erlang. This could really freak out the Erlang ""old guard"" - many are friends of mine - but they don't really care that much, as Erlang has has always been a niche musical instrument and Elixir is Erlang's ticket to Carnegie Hall.",1367063662

5617501,comment,5615610,5617303,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The point pg is making is that it's not an averages game, it's a lottery game.<p>Say there are two different people playing the lottery. Every day they buy a number of tickets. Person A buys tickets in a pool along with someone else. Person B buys tickets on their own. Thus, if Person A wins the lottery they'll have to split their winnings, whereas Person B gets to keep it all.<p>OK, so who ends up being better off? The answer to that is entirely decoupled from their share of the lottery winnings, what matters is entirely whether or not they won the lottery. In terms of VC financing, the RoI from ""winning the lottery"" by hitching your horse to a small company that grows until a multi-billion dollar enterprise in a few years is going to dwarf any other aspect of investing and returns. Thus it's vastly more important to ensure that you are doing everything possible to maximize ""winning the lottery"" rather than trying to maximize the share of the prize you'll get. 2x or 3x may seem like a lot, but it's nothing compared to the 100x, 1000x, or 10000x that you'll get from being on the ground floor of the next big thing.<p>For example, Horace Rackham was an early investor in Ford and he received a 1300x RoI, Peter Thiel received a 3000x RoI on his investment in Facebook, while Kleiner and Sequoia capital each turned $12.5 million into $2 billion through their investments in google.",1367063099

The community was significantly less ""toxic"". This may have been due to its smaller size, but there were also game mechanics that I think contributed to it.<p>First, I focused on uneven games being fun. This was mostly achieved by (partially) shared income. On a smaller team your portion of the shared income was higher, so your hero was stronger. An ally leaving had upsides: suddenly you'd have a higher income and a bunch of back-dated income.<p>Second, dying had no downsides except you had five lives. You didn't get a time-out. The enemy didn't get experience or a pile of money for killing you. Instead, you'd repick your hero and spawn back at base right away. When you died you came back specialized for the current situation and you came back fast (you had constructive things to do; no time to focus on complaining). Until your last life, dying actually had upsides! Sometimes people would even strategically die, trading a life in order to switch roles or to teleport to the base (in dire situations).<p>It was hard to be angry at a terrible player for dying repeatedly... they were removing themselves from the game, after all. I'm sure the smaller team size, and the presence of 'safe' tasks like moving tanks to defend key areas, also didn't hurt. Having a weak player on your team wasn't ideal, but you could still have a fun game where they contributed.",1367062155

Strictly speaking, I do consider myself the final arbiter on morals.  Meaning, what I want has priority over anything else.

We just raised a big rouf from A16Z and have been written up in tons of blogs/etc.<p>For the past two years (since I joined), we've all been feeling the same thing. Scaling, running out of disk space, needing that one Product hire terribly, hearing from investors about that one feature we discussed back in Dec 2010 that is still 'a few releases away.'<p>I have fallen into this trap a few times as the dirextor of product.<p>However what I've realized, is one thing that helps me sleep at night:
Despite feeling like we're losing the race and not making progress, we've overhauled our architecture, revamped our entire consumer and internal software to be much more user friendly, built a strong release heartbeat to crank out one solid feature a week, rebranded the company, and built confidence in our org that people's ideas will be heard.<p>We've made great progress, and even though there are things that our CEO and investors still want us to build, I'm damn proud of how far we've come. I'm still scared shitless about conpetitors and hitting our goals for the year... And it drives me nuts when I see another company launch something that I'm excited about, but then I look back to our product 2 years ago, and I can't help but smile at how far we've come.<p>The only advice I can give you (apart from saying thst this is totally normal!) is to continue to focus on what's most important, not most urgent. Sure, many of the fires you described today sound terrible, but what is the #1 most important thing today? Is it revenue? Is it growth?<p>Once you've identified that, pick the single most significant thing you can do to make an impact, and do it. Then re-evaluate.<p>If you find yourself fixing the most urgent thing constantly (I.e. servers are slow, investor is calling), you will just run in circles and constantly feel like you're behind and not making progress.<p>If you as a company can agree on the most important thing at any time and run towards it at 200% velocity, that momentum will always make you feel like you're making forward progress.<p>Good luck, and feel free to email me (address in my profile) if you have questions or need a pep talk :P",1367061675

May sound a little fluffy or cliche, but bear with me.<p>My high school had a different grading scale than the 10-point scale used by most high schools and colleges. So:<p>95-100 was an A;
88-94 was a B; 
82-87 was a C;
76-81 was a D;
75 or below and you failed<p>Brutal. But, I didn't even realize this until I got to college. What was once failing was now a C. And what was once a D could now be a B. It was a liberating feeling, but it underscored two things:<p>1. I could have had a much higher GPA in high-school
2. These measurements are artificial and arbitrary as a means for determining our ""value"" or even our proficiency in a subject<p>I get that these measurements can have real impact on our lives, because others use them. The key is not to believe they tell us anything about ourselves beyond our performance in a specific context, wherein an arbitrary measurement is applied.<p>Find what you love and learn it. If you struggle to do so in the environment, then work with professors, other students, and whatever resources are available to help you learn to learn. Once you've done that, you will find that the actual education and knowledge gained is more important, valuable, and self-improving than its measurement.<p>Ironically, you will also see a lift in your grades.

5617437,comment,5616786,5616786,8,0,Joeri,,,"All through high school, I was this guy. So sure of my own abilities, so sure that all I lacked to achieve was intent. When i went to university, failing my first compsci year badly, this served as a wake up call. Strangely however it was not the one I needed. It showed me that I knew less than I thought I did, but I remained convinced that with good solid cramming I could force into my brain what I needed to excel and that fundamentally those students that did get good grades were no better. It didn't help that I got good grades on the actual programming parts, it was mostly the theoretical subjects that I failed. But my intentions to cram what I lacked in theoretical knowledge never panned out. I could never motivate myself enough to cram as long and as hard as it seemed I needed to, and I continued to get bad grades. I made excuses, how a long period of illness prevented me from studying, how getting great scores didn't matter as long as I passed. But in the end, the results stayed the same.<p>Eventually I was forced by my parents to a decision: get serious or drop out. I dropped out and got a programming job.<p>And then something strange happened. I felt a sort of obligation to my employer to not slack off. Where i could never spend 8 hours a day in motivated effort for myself, i could do it for someone else. Not with ease mind you, i was physically exhausted those first weeks, and I suffered from many stress-induced health problems the first year. But gradually i got into a rhythm of continuous sustainable dedicated work. And then i figured out some things.<p>A. Cramming doesn't work. The only healthy pace to truly learn is one that you keep up indefinitely. I noticed that high achievers almost invariably are always in study mode, but don't overexert themselves. Slow and steady wins the race.<p>B. Knowledge compounds. The longer you continually apply yourself, the more return on additional knowledge you get. Again i noticed that high achievers had always been studying, while i was slacking off. The foundation they had cannot be bypassed. It's the whole 10.000 hours thing. The reason i did well on the programming subjects at university was because i had always been programming throughout high school, even while i slacked off on everything else.<p>C. Humility and self-doubt are they key to self-improvement. If you are sure that you're already great, you will block yourself from the path of self-improvement.<p>By changing my habits I changed my results. I'm now a tech lead for a dozen other developers, and enjoy a reputation as a top achiever. I still feel awkward with that reputation though, because i can easily recall those times where i felt better than i actually was, so I try to remain humble.",1367060879

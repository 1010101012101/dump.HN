The IRL social network that religion provides, in addition to its palliative effects, comprise the major sources of utility from religious belief.<p>And I think it does a good job of explaining the uphill battle that evangelical atheists have. In order to convert someone, you have to convince them that being correct on a technical metaphysical issue is worth the real costs that they will bear for abandoning their religion. It's not the most appealing sales proposition.<p>Religion has been around for as long as humans have. I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon. And despite the fact that I think it's wrong, I have serious doubts that the world would be a better place without it.<p>This is also the crux of the disagreement that I have with the self-proclaimed rationalists (see the blog Less Wrong for examples). Rationalists believe that what is true is also always beneficial, but I am not convinced that this is necessarily so. I find it easy to imagine a world where believing some false propositions was beneficial, and I suspect we may even live in such a world.",1239569970

The toolchain is reasonable and Obj-C is fun (well, not fun like python but really funnier than Symbian C++, who tried it know what I mean).\nOvi Store (last time I checked) will not even accept app from individual doing development part-time, without having a company. So, for me and many many other it is a dead game.\nNokia does other very interesting things (N810 and maemo comes to mind) but Ovi store is a no brainer (at least for me). I'm talking as an european that had only Nokia phones in the last 15 years and uses an N95 as main phone (and an iPhone for apps and browsing).",1239569869

I was totally and utterly perplexed. Here was a woman smarter than Einstein and Hawking squandering away her intelligence on such downright silly matters. You don't need an IQ of 230 to write a newspaper column... you just don't.<p>It pissed me off then, but I never gave it much attention... Since then I've left the States and totally cast her out of mind. But when the topic comes up, I just shrug and guess that this is God's way of showing us that you don't need to be the world's most intelligent in order to accomplish something, because sometimes the biggest ""geniuses"" amongst us are the biggest idiots in reality.<p>An IQ like that applied to literally <i>anything</i> under the sun other than a newspaper column could yield huge benefits to humanity. It doesn't matter what - anything she likes. History, psychology, chemistry, physics, math, computers, English, philosophy, <i>anything</i>.<p>But she didn't. And that pisses me off like crazy. Because I don't have her IQ but I work day and night hoping to make this world a better place.... and there she is, showing off her IQ as if at the World Fair to make petty gains as a household celebrity, a freak of nature rather than one of the luckiest people on the planet.",1239569502

558841,comment,557618,557957,0,0,kubrick,,,"The idea that the split infinitive is bad comes from a fixation in the 18th century that Latin (long dead even at that time) was a somehow superior language. You can't split infinitives in Latin (or most of its descendents). ""To sleep"" in Latin is <i>dormire</i>. That includes the concept of ""to"", so there's no way to say ""to soundly sleep"". You'd have to put it as ""to sleep soundly,"" and so automatically, that's the ""correct"" form in English, too. English is an inferior language to Latin, right?<p>Same story with ending a sentence with a preposition, dangling participles, and other taboos: there may be nothing fundamentally wrong with it, but you couldn't or didn't do it in Latin. Ergo, it's bad.<p>The real fault is the attempt to make functional language into hard science. It's not. Language was not invented by god. It's a human construct, and using it is nearly an art.<p>Good advice? Useful. Sure, don't over-explain. But don't bother getting into an argument with someone about whether a word in a sentence was truly necessary. People who do those kind of things have lost perspective.",1239568416

But first you have to understand the one caveat which is this: most people don’t want to hear the truth.<p>The current ""Twitter Worm"" story is a perfect example.  The worm really doesn’t cause any damage.  It doesn’t hurt anything.  But you have all these terrifying claims coming out of the tech media.<p>Why?<p>Because people like a crisis.  It gets their heart pumping a little faster and they vicariously make themselves a part of it by following the coverage.  That’s why news agencies devote every moment they can during things like hurricanes.  Because they know people will watch.<p>This exists in pretty much all things.  Truth is complex and by its nature contains both sides of the story.  While most people want to react to things as Good or Bad, Dangerous or Safe, and so on.<p>That said, promoting the truth to those who want to hear it is pretty simple.  Just put up a web site, publish only when you know you’re being accurate, and wait.

It is characterized by magical thinking, such as ""if you follow your heart, everything will turn out for the best!""<p>To some extent, this is valuable. It encourages people to take risks and be creative. The wonderful explosion of technology and prosperity in the 1990s was an expression of magical thinking.<p>But I think we place too little value on financial stability, independence, and other more boring traditional values. This could be because we've never really had to face hard times until now. I wonder if we will pick up these traits during the recession.",1239566901

I had to fight with an aggressive postfix filter that kept sending mail to a lisp process and did no error checking to see if Lisp ran and processed the mail. I had to remove the filter, and manually rebuild stuff later after I had the system running around 12PM the next day.<p>It was one day in hell, taught me that the unix errno and process exit status can be a fucked thing to debug if you're forking multiple process from a script.<p>[Edit: right now I'm coding sitting on the toilet seat, with my pants on, because I'm a moody SOB and like to move around the house as the day passes :-]",1239566868

Each time she does, it feels like she's accusing me of actively trying to be that way -- of being broken. She's not, of course. That's just how it feels to Mr Logic.<p>And maybe people like us <i>are</i> broken, in a sense. It feels like I'm missing something everyone else around me seems to have: an ability to immediately understand the reason why people phrase things the way they do.<p>The person you're referring to probably knows he has the problem and has forgotten about it. If you want to point it out to him, pretend like you're pointing out an embarrasing bad habit, like picking his nose. So you probably want to tell him in private, etc. Also he'll probably deny having the problem. Let him deny it. Just tell him <i>specific</i> examples of what you've noticed. The more specific, the better. A video would be ideal. (Not that I think you'll get one; I'm just trying to convey that telling him specific examples is very important, because otherwise he won't be able to make the mental leap ""I have a problem"" => ""Here's how I fix it"".)",1239566454

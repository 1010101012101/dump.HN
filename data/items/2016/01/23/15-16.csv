If something doesn’t deliver business value, it’s 0x.&quot;<p>I have found myself to work really well as a &quot;value enabler&quot; of 10x engineers. It&#x27;s a symbiosis thing - my best work has been done working with a 10x engineer with our skills complementing each other (I&#x27;m strong on the business value/UX side, defining overall architecture/network protocols/optimizations etc, but weak in e.g. hardcore C low-level implementation.)<p>A challenge: Whenever I&#x27;ve stopped spending 20 hours a week working closely with these guys (in order to focus on building other essential parts of the business where there are no 10x engineers), their output value has severely decreased. They often fall back to like 2-3x. (Really nothing to be ashamed of, but...)<p>Things like this can make company switching challenging :).",1453564762

I am comparing BO and SpaceX the same way I&#x27;d compare google and apple. In the same industry but not doing exactly the same thing. And when Apple tried to go on one of Google&#x27;s turf with maps, they sucked. When Google tried to go do phones, at first they sucked. Comparison is natural and welcome.<p>Here, it feels to me that BO is putting themselves up for comparison for no reason.<p>As far as the positive direction of spaceflight, I think that transparency is key. Space exploration needs more accountability and trust that ever has been available before _in_any_industry_ever_. And there, so far SpaceX is winning hands down, including versus the old players (soyouz, ariane, ULA...). When SpaceX says &quot;one of our struts was structurally deficient, broke down, made the rocket lose equilibrium and ultimately  explode&quot;, they&#x27;re also telling their competitors &quot;Watch this. We&#x27;ve learned it the hard way.&quot;. Same with fog icing the leg lock. In the grand scheme of things they are making space safer, and not only for their customers.

I haven&#x27;t really played a AAA game since, and have only played two video games all the way through since (Braid, and Monument Valley).<p>When the OP talks about working on a project so big that no one person really &quot;grocks&quot; the whole thing I can relate, but I also want to say &quot;it shows&quot;.<p>IMO, the current state of AAA games is shit. I think the reason they are this way have to do with what the OP is complaining about, the originating vision of the game comes from Marketing not an artist, and no one person has vision for the game. Maybe video games just have too many resources at there disposal.<p>I think I read somewhere that either Ocarina of Time or Mario 64 had double or triple the playable content of the released game and Miyamoto had a perfectionist eye for the game and was merciless in what made the cut.<p>Resource constraints are a good thing, IMO, as it forces people to make a razor focused product that trims the fat mercilessly.<p>Having unlimited resources is the enemy of good decision making, and it shows in the current state of video games (and film too).

Common threads include someone wanting to have sex with them, possess them as a wife/trophy, control what they due like property, and so on. I think she&#x27;s thinking sex or dating.<p>Anyway, one usually logically follows from the other: attractiveness or desirability increases odds of desire and an advance to be made. Most men are hardwired to want to try. Womens reaction seems to depend on upbringing and ideology. It might be acceptance, totally ignoring it, an eye roll that&#x27;s neutral, mild irritation, or irritation/anger/hate worth blog posts. Down here the latter is rare. The women let people know what they tolerate then anyone pushing those boundaries too hard is clearly an asshole. Many will gripe about how men are on occasion but their gripes usually apply to their flings, boyfriends, and husbands. ;)<p>Truth is, this position of anything resulting from attraction counts as an unwanted &quot;advance&quot; will be rejected by most men. That&#x27;s because it means we either can never pursue great, smart women in our field. Or that a double standard exists where only they can initiate the process. Many of them were fine with such double standards that put their gender in control. I&#x27;m not. Nor would I want to date the types of women hitting clubs and such.<p>All seems to me as selfish and controlling of social situations as the guys they describe. Too extreme, too, to be realistic.

In the past, there was no significant incentive for the cost of higher education to increase at the pace we&#x27;ve seen for the last 20-30 years.<p>The big mistake was pushing for individual loans for each student to pay for college rather than subsidizing the system. This created distorted incentives where schools needed to spend money on &quot;extra&quot; things to attract students who had money to spend, rather than trying to push down the cost of providing quality education to each student. Schools that didn&#x27;t invest would not attract paying customers. Providing the level of service & extra amenities students expect is <i>expensive</i>, and carries a lot of overhead support cost from administrative staff.<p>> making the process of educating less costly by using technology<p>Technology is not a silver bullet. The cost of delivering education at scale is not where the waste is. Much like the healthcare sector, there is a huge administrative infrastructure at every school dedicated to facilitating a complex system of loans, grants, scholarships, individual payments, etc., for accounting. These jobs are unlikely to be eliminated with automation. The best answer is to make them unnecessary outright.<p>> if a degree was about what you know, not just a credential<p>A degree has <i>never</i> been about what you know, otherwise we&#x27;d award them to everyone who has equivalent work and life experience. But it&#x27;s also not just a credential. The value of college is not limited to the academic requirements. A society benefits from an informed and educated populace, and from the personal growth that happens when smart folks learn together. That isn&#x27;t to say that the country club lifestyle of American colleges today is providing services worth the cost...",1453563831

I&#x27;ll base both off my personal experience - Kmail and KDE Telepathy - since those are my email and IM client.<p>In kmail, to use GPG keys, I need to go to Settings -> Configure -> Identity -> Modify -> Cryptography, change my signing and encryption keys (and it supports PGP or MIME) and then, since I don&#x27;t already have keys, need to open Kleopatra, the KDE GPG client.<p>Kleopatra uses keys.gpupg.net as its default keyserver, and you can do file -> new certificate to make one. Its a wizard, so you go step by step, setting up a password for the cert along the way. You also make a revoke cert you save somewhere.<p>Once you made the key, you need to export it to the server. And you probably want to make a signing and encryption key, since if you got this far you are already a super techy nerd and that is what makes my point right there.<p>If you want normal people to be able to use gpg in kmail, there needs to be a wizard just like the &quot;add account wizard&quot; called &quot;Setup GPG&quot; that searches for keys that match your email address first in case you already have them and if there are none generates you new ones and just asks you for the password. It handles the propagation and importing of keys itself because thats not something a user should be dealing with unless they need to.<p>And even that is unlikely to happen - you want the GPG setup to really be a part of the first-start of Kmail process. Like the first time you open the program and get the &quot;add account&quot; button you should also get &quot;setup security&quot;.<p>But even if you can get people <i>making</i> keys, the UX sucks because it makes them enter a password every time you send an email. You should be able to do what kwallet recently did, and bind the unlock key to your GPG keys to your user session so that when you enter the desktop via SDDM it unlocks your GPG keys just like it unlocks your wallet. Then people can use secure email whenever they want without any bullshit.<p>There are even more UX nightmares - getting your keys across different computers, easily revoking them if they get compromised, even knowing what that means.<p>By comparison OTR in Telepathy is almost usable. In KTP you just hit the &quot;use OTR&quot; button and if your chat partner does the same it automagically generates and shares the keys, no user interaction required. The only downside is that you don&#x27;t get local logging of your OTR conversations - that should definitely be an option, maybe even encrypt them with your kwallet keys! Eh, eh?<p>But these kind of UX nightmares keep secure communications from being a thing. Mumble is literally the best security solution I have, because I can get a letsencrypt cert, run my own server, put on a password, and anyone chatting on it has perfect security in voice and text - the whole thing is encrypted, I can do my own trust network based off my x509 cert, and it even supports pinned users so nobody can impersonate anyone else.<p>But I say that its the best because for anyone I invite, they literally just need to enter the password I give them to my server. Sure, its problematic to <i>give</i> them the password if you don&#x27;t have a secure communication link beforehand, but I guess thats what OTR is for! Oh drat...",1453562337

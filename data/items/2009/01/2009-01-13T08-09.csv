I worked in those for 4 years and never had an issue with them. Sure, there is a slight decrease in your personal productivity due to the likelihood of distractions and interruptions, but that is balanced by an increase in team productivity thanks to an increase in communication.<p>Work is not all about your own personal work. In fact, in the large organisations where I worked, I'd say at least 50% of the work that people ended up doing was a result of miscommunication, and so there are clearly huge benefits in finding ways to decrease that miscommunication.<p>Even programming work was largely dependent on communication. The projects where I worked didn't do any rocket science that required weeks of solitary work to chew through, but it did require a good understanding of arcane, bizarre business (finance) rules and interface requirements, and the bottleneck there was definitely communication rather than concentration.",1231836596

You are then asked if the life will be acceptable. If you give your OK, your memory is wiped clean and you get to live that life. Otherwise, you get to look at another life. So, the life you lead, with all its suffering and challenges, is the life you chose on that day.</i><p>Not to put too fine a point on it, as this is clearly just a fluffy inspirational quote, and the article itself is worth reading, but this quote kinda sorta makes no sense. Here's why:<p><i>You are then asked if the life will be acceptable.</i> What you find acceptable is a function of who you are. Who you are is also largely a function of the experiences you have had in life. What I find acceptable now is not what I found acceptable 10 years ago and probably not what I will find acceptable in 10 years. So, acceptable from what perspective? The perspective of the person who has lived that life, or the perspective of someone else? Those are two very different perspectives that will lead to very different answers.<p>Another big hole is that there are only a finite number of existences out there. So surely someone has to be stumped with a life they didn't like. It is condescending and incredibly insulting to tell someone whose life really, really sucks that they chose it.<p>So, a nice article, with a nice fluffy thought at the beginning, but the gaping holes in that fluffy thought kind of bothered me.",1231836005

Noisebridge, a 501c3 in San Francisco, is tangentially related to the so-called ""hackerspaces"" movement. Coworking is a gym, Noisebridge is a community. Coworking spaces are quiet places to do your day job. Noisebridge is a place to learn why your kernel module isn't working by talking to the person to your left. The person to your left just happens to be a kernel hacker  and she is totally happy to talk to you; she's there for both social and technical reasons.<p>It's a safe space for asking questions and it's a safe space to find the answers together.<p>It's the kind of place where you drag a safe in off of the street and learn how to crack it. Because you're spending your spare time with ten other people interested in understanding mechanical locks, it will open.",1231835370

431806,comment,431703,431703,0,0,asnyder,,,"Normally I would recommend you hunker down and try to write a program, or join an open source project, but since you said that you've had trouble teaching yourself I recommend you look for an unpaid internship. Every few months we take a few interns from high schools and colleges and start them off on basic projects which eventually evolve into more complicated ones. This gives you concrete goals while you learn new and interesting things in order to complete those goals. Usually you'll also have the benefit of collaborating with other interns in addition to asking the more experienced coders for help if you've exhausted all other options. We've found that most of the interns improve significantly during this period, it might work for you too.",1231834647

You need some motivation for what you are doing.  Wanting to learn to program is not enough.  For example, I have wanted to learn Haskell for a few months. Being a busy college student however means that it's difficult to find time for such an abstract goal.  Tangable, realistic projects are the best route to go.  I never fully learned or understood C until I was hacking around Linux in my operating systems class last semester.  Pick a small project that you want to accomplish, ask for advice about which language would be best, and then have at it.",1231834515

It's nice to see libraries that try to do just a few things really well without taking over everything else.<p>I have a couple minor quibbles about the crypto though (although, IANAC so take this with a grain of salt):<p>In your symmetric encryption routine, you include an HMAC of the encrypted IV and the ciphertext by computing HMAC_k($encrypted_iv . $ciphertext).  This is problematic because an attacker can shift data from the end of the IV to the beginning of ciphertext without being caught immediately.  Presumably it will garble the message in a way that will be noticed, but that's not a great assumption to make.  At the very least it lets the attacker cause the script to spew warnings by passing an empty IV.<p>Using Triple-DES to encrypt an IV for AES also strikes me as a little weird.  If you include the IV in an HMAC, you don't gain anything by encrypting it (since the entire point of encrypting the IV is to prevent someone from modifying it in transit).",1231834260

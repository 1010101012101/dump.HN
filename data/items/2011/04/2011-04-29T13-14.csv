At the beginning of this year, I weighed 236 pounds (6'1"") and felt terrible about how I'd let my body get so out of shape. So, I made a commitment (mostly with myself, but let everyone else know) that I wouldn't eat out at restaurants (one of my favorite things to do - I'm a big foodie) until I got under 200 lbs. That was the only commitment - all of the details, as in what to eat, how to work out, etc. I figured I'd optimize as time went on because I wanted to go out to eat again.<p>It's been 4 months and I'm at 203 now - so I've lost about 2 pounds a week (while gaining a bunch of muscle too), and am closing in on my (initial...) goal of 200 lbs. Going to have a bit of a celebration, and then set another one for 180 and some type of cardiovascular measurement / achievement. This has been one of the best things I've done in my life so far.",1304085569

And in many interpreters, exceptions are basically free.<p>(Except on MacOS, where setjmp() and longjmp() are an order of magnitude slower because they involve system calls.)<p>I had a discussion with a mainframer a couple of years back about what kinds of things people did in assembly that aren't reflected in C.  One interesting technique he mentioned was incrementing the return address in case of error returns, so the function actually had two different possible points to return to; the calling code would look something like this (x86 version):<p><pre><code>        CALL SOMEROUTINE
        JMP 1f
        JMP ERROR
    1   ; continue with normal processing
</code></pre>
In case of error, the routine bumped its return address by the size of a jump instruction before returning to the JMP ERROR instruction.<p>Such a pattern would be awfully disconcerting if you weren't used to it, of course.<p>Multiple return values were, of course, another thing he mentioned.  Any caller-saved register can double as an additional return value.",1304083432

http://i.imgur.com/pL8W2.png<p>From what I know, and what I have read this is an XSS, Im not completely sure of which length of script could I execute but I think it could be enough to load a script from another page, and then do the malicious stuff.<p>I contacted Posterous through their Feedback form about 3 or 4 weeks ago, and I havent received an answer. Since the post still shows the alert and its not fixed they may have not read the mail or discarded it...<p>Can anybody confirm that this is dangerous?",1304082818

I'm one of those people who bought the PS3 just for OtherOS(and thankfully never got the removal patch) and honestly, given the lackluster performance it has and this move, I'm highly tempted to just sell it.

It took me forever to figure out that part of the reason that I was always so frustrated with people was because I wasn't communicating well enough with them. Oftentimes I'd think I had expressed one thing and later I would find out that the other person had completely misinterpreted my meaning. After the n-th time I figured I was partly to blame and decided to do something about it and picking up a grammar book was the first step. It's not hard, it just takes practice like anything else and the benefits of being understood better are definitely worth it.",1274284662

So I took a look at the claims for US patent 5,742,768 (""System and method for providing and displaying a web page having an embedded menu""). Claim 1 is (I'm paraphrasing a bit) having a web page with an applet that displays a menu in which there are some links. You might think ""oh yeah, that's a typically overbroad claim 1"", but the others don't restrict it in at-all-interesting ways. Doing it <i>over the internet</i>. Doing it <i>on a private internet</i>. Doing it <i>in Java</i>. And -- this is as innovative as it gets -- having the applet <i>pop up a menu when the user's pointer moves over a hot spot in the web page</i>.<p>Yup, it's true that sometimes what seems on the face of it a ridiculous patent turns out to be a more sensible one whose title and/or abstract make it look worse than it is.

This community is going down hill rapidly...<p>Firstly, the comment you refer to IS relevant because the article explicitly states that PosgreSQL cannot compete with Oracle, et al in the enterprise. I mean it's right there in the conclusion. Maybe it needs more info to back it up, but then so does the article itself when it makes its point.<p>Secondly,  the reason I would wager on it being the highest rated comment is because the greatest value of HN comments is when you finish reading one of these articles and are quite taken in by the premise, many times (for me personally) right there at the top of the comment page is someone with a different experience reminding you not be so impressionable. In my time here this quality of HN comments has been consistent. In this case I would say patio11's fleshed out response is more useful (edit: and already it has overtaken the parent in votes - I would hold off any emergency quality control measures for the time being) but the cream usually rises to the top.<p>> I wonder if this type of degradation is inevitable when the masses invade<p>When I read a reaction like this to someone's comment, I always find it interesting to click on the user profiles and see when both parties joined.

Back when I lived in California, I was staying at the Techcrunch HQ in Atherton. Now, however, I'm bringing the rest of the guys along and we need suggestions as to:<p>1) Where to stay. It's tough finding a place to rent for 3 months that isn't crazy expensive (we don't need the swimming pools or tennis courts, even if we like to have fun). Should we just stick to lurking Craigslist, or does anyone have little secret housing gems in the bay?<p>2) How to finance it. We have a pretty exciting idea and we're building an MVP. The people we talked to are interested in putting in money, but we wanted to be creative with funding our stint in the valley - we don't want to spend investor money in housing (should we? meh). We have an existing product that will help finance this, but we'd like to do something creative. Any thoughts?<p>I guess this is it for now. We're doing this for the idea first, the experience second, the fun third. Would love to hear your suggestions, questions and thoughts.",1274283316

Breakfast NY created a novel device that showcases developer experimentation at its finest by turning the iPad into a remote controller of a mini blimp equipped with a “blimp cam” that leverages the built-in accelerometer.  Whenever the blimp’s camera hovered over a person, the iPad software transformed their faces into those of the Munny characters. The feed was displayed on a big screen for all to see.<p>The iPad app was built in 2-3 days by one person using Appcelerator’s Titanium 1.2 mobile SDK and relied heavily on the newly added TCPSocket.  They mostly used basic UI components such as buttons and textfields. However, the TCPSocket API together with the accelerometer for basic right and left navigation is what makes the core functionality with the app. Breakfast NY communicated from the iPad app to the blimp via a laptop running a tcp-to-serial bridge and the laptop speaks to the blimp via an xbee chip (serial).<p>For the video, they used a webcontrol in which they are drawing the video (motion jpeg) using server push.  They found that using this technique over quicktime stream had a considerable benefit in terms of lag (only 100-200 milliseconds).",1274283170

Basically, we’re planning for the site to become very big over time and want to make sure our structure is giving us the biggest bang for our SEO buck. Below I have linked to a post on our blog that outlines a perspective from a key member of our the team. Clearly a more descriptive context as to what type of site we’re working on could be helpful, however my question to you is this: which structure - domain-based (topic.company.com), path-based (company.com/topic), or a hybrid - will deliver the most value from an SEO standpoint? If you have an opinion on the matter, we’d love it know it!

If the Notion Ink Adam (<a href=""http://www.notionink.in/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.notionink.in/</a>) lives up to the hype, then I will buy it, and it's more likely to be with me.  I love the display and the form factor on the Kindle.  It just disappears in your hands and is great for reading.  My problem is I consume so much more dynamic media (blogs, websites, etc) these days and a lot less static (books).   More often than not I grab my phone than the kindle for reading, which means I read fewer books and more websites.<p>The Kindle is horrible for reading magazines.  Navigation and skimming are stone-age, and there aren't any of the pictures that many of the magazines I want to read (I don't read physical magazines as they aren't conveniently located) are enhanced by.<p>The Kindle also is horrible for reading anything with footnotes.  The ""joy""stick provides anything but.  Try reading a footnote heavy book (my particular example being one Oliver Sacks book) with the Kindle and you'll be ready to send a blank check to the inventor of the touchscreen.",1274281634

She appears to be describing a friendly person who enjoys talking to his colleagues about things he's interested in when he gets in to work. Let's look at her complaints:<p>1. He asked her to comment on a scientific paper involving sexual behavior in animals.<p>2. He told her about a book he was reading on Casanova — specifically that he admired Casanova's adaptability to different situations and skill at gambling (Note: This is the emphasis she herself gives; I'm not downplaying any sexual component)<p>3. He said he would like to do a course on ""sinful"" behavior such as gambling, in which he might dress like the devil on some occasion<p>4. He asked her out to dinner, saying she could bring her husband and he would bring his girlfriend. He showed up without his girlfriend, but did bring another companion in her place. At the end of the night he gave her a hug and kissed her cheek ""in the presence of [her] husband""<p>5. He likes to come into her office in the morning and chat, often about technical fields outside of his degree<p>6. He initially complimented her along the lines of ""You look good in that outfit,"" she told him she didn't appreciate that sort of talk, and since then he has been more distant and kept his conversation with her strictly to scholarly matters<p>The picture she paints of him is very much that of a friendly guy who likes to talk to his peers about the things he's thinking about. Particularly the incident where she was scandalized that he hugged her and gave her a kiss on the cheek <i></i>in front of her husband<i></i> combined with how upset she was that he'd thought about dressing as the devil makes me think this is a culture clash between somebody extremely conservative and somebody much less so.",1274281432

8640726,comment,8639292,8640516,0,0,lazaroclapp,,,"Not really. Those are reasonable examples of what it takes to try to &quot;force&quot; an entire country out of capitalism &quot;for their own good&quot;. Socialism as a part of a general economic or ethical philosophy - embedded within the liberal democratic system - is not quite as bad on its own. The fundamental ideas behind the movement led to things like universal public education, national investment in the sciences and arts, as well as universal public healthcare. These are all things which almost every modern nation recognizes as good ideas. Where it goes off the rails is when you formulate an entire political theory that can be summed as &quot;We shall get a moral and dependable dictator to forbid people from engaging in Capitalism or owning excessive property, thus forcing everyone to work for the common good. This will eventually lead to people naturally working for the common good, because that&#x27;s what humans naturally do.&quot;. The main problem with that one is obvious by word #8, but it contains a few extra fallacies beyond that.<p>Now, it&#x27;s perfectly possible to embed socialized literature grants and &quot;literary tenure&quot; within a capitalist system if democratic society believes that is the best way of generating valuable literary works that are not likely to produce an immediate return of investment in the open market. We can even do that simultaneously with a publishing industry producing literary works with a focus towards profitability. Scientific research and some forms of artistic creation already work this way.<p>As for completely replacing capitalism, as opposed to just having a mostly-capitalist mixed economy? Well, I can&#x27;t see it happening in a scarcity society, but I can imagine it happening in a post-scarcity one. Suppose we get to the point where robots farm food for us, robots gather natural resources for us and robots keep basic infrastructure working for us. Now, suppose that at one point we mostly trade in &quot;services&quot; and &quot;ideas&quot; (software, books, music, movies, 3D printable designs for all our physical stuff). At what point there does capitalism becomes silly? &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t need money to live, I am designing this car to get paid so that I can buy the 3D printable design of my bed. Oh, wait, someone open-sourced the design for the bed I wanted, neat, let me print it. Guess I can open-source my car design too.&quot; &quot;But hey, does that mean you are never making another car design?&quot; &quot;Are you kidding? I love designing cars and what else would I do with my time? Besides, I get a kick out of seeing people driving the car I designed!&quot;. The beauty is that we wouldn&#x27;t even need most people to think that way, just a small fixed count from the population. Things like reputation and competition for real state might have to be solved differently in a society without capitalism, but lets be honest, capitalism is a poor system for solving those two anyways, as evidenced by rent prices in the Bay Area and &quot;Am I a failure if I am not worth $1Bn by age 22?&quot; questions on Quora.<p>Now, capitalism is probably still the best system we know of to solve resource allocation and promote technological innovation in the conditions of contemporary human society. But those conditions are subject to change. So, yes, &quot;we need capitalism because people need to exchange and accumulate [physical, non-duplicable, scarce] goods freely&quot; is true at the moment. But so would have been at a time: &quot;we need the King to keep all the feudal lords and their peasants united in peace and organized in the case of barbarian invasions&quot;.<p>(Note: This rant turned longer than I expected. Also, HN might be the weirdest place on the net to do a Commie rant ;) )",1416567406

That would imply radical change is necessarily bad and should be avoided everywhere.  Carriages to cars, ice houses to refrigeration, bow and arrow to black powder.  Every single one of these radical changes required people to learn something vastly different.  With your reasoning we should&#x27;ve waited longer for some intermediate technology to smooth the learning curve.  People were getting really good at taking care of horses, now they need auto mechanics?  Building an ice house was becoming a science, how do I fix leaking refrigerant?  My aim and dexterity with a box is second to none, but now we&#x27;re using guns?  Now your first thought might be that all of those things are different than server admin, but are they really?  I would suggest the only thing different for server admins is that it&#x27;s entirely less radical of a change than all of these other technologies.<p>As for my comment being unwarranted, sysadmin&#x27;ing requires learning new tech.  If there is an improvement on a tech such that it has mass adoption, learn the tech.  It&#x27;s your job.  If you don&#x27;t like it, change jobs.  I&#x27;m not saying you should shut up and put up.  However, we&#x27;re far past that stage of valued input and people are still complaining.  The decisions have pretty much been made that are going to be made concerning systemd adoption.

8640709,comment,8639317,8640536,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, I find the whole article so full of wrong that I didn&#x27;t think it needed more than simply calling it &quot;wrong&quot;. Though seeing how many upvotes it now has, I guess <i>I</i> was wrong.<p>But, if you insist, let&#x27;s break it down a bit:<p><i>&quot;...FreeBSD...also ships with ZFS as part of the kernel and has a jails which is a much more baked technology and implementation than LXC.&quot;</i><p>Which is an assertion that would require significant citation and specification about the ways in which the author believes jails to be superior in order to be a useful claim. I believe it is an assertion based on ignorance of either Jails or LXC, or the ways those technologies have been used historically and are being used today. For most of the uses I see talked about on HN, LXC is the &quot;more baked&quot; implementation. While Jails has existed for a <i>long</i> time, it was not intended for the purposes we&#x27;re using LXC for today in Docker and similar deployments. The tools exist, the resource management exists, for LXC and they don&#x27;t, or are quite rudimentary for jails. To suggest someone choose jails where they are currently using Docker and LXC is to suggest they live with a large variety of limitations and pain points, and in a lot of cases to simply not do what they are currently doing, or to do it in wildly different ways. All to avoid the minor pain that is represented by SystemD for most users.<p>In short: Jails are not (currently) a reasonable alternative to LXC in that context, and it exhibits some kind of ignorance to suggest them.<p>Continuing on, despite your suggestion that he is talking about SmartOS or OmniOS, he quite clearly is not. He specifically mentions Solaris while mentioning the others as other options:<p><i>&quot;Speaking of zones and Solaris, if that’s an option for you it’s probably the best of breed stack right now. Rich mature OS-level virtualization. SmartOS brings along KVM support for when you HAVE to run Linux but backed by Solaris tech under the hood. There’s also OmniOS as a variant as well.&quot;</i><p>That paragraph clearly <i>is</i> recommending Solaris, specifically. If you&#x27;d like to argue that Solaris is a reasonable alternative for most Linux users, it&#x27;s a conversation I&#x27;m going to opt out of. I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;d be speaking completely different languages.<p><i>&quot;If you absolutely MUST run Linux, my recommendation is to minimize the interaction with the base distro as much as possible. CoreOS (when it’s finally baked and production ready) can bring you an LXC based ecosystem.&quot;</i><p>So, CoreOS is the Linux option he recommends? The same CoreOS that uses SystemD? Indeed, was among the first distros to embrace SystemD with gusto. CoreOS, that is <i>remarkably</i> different than all other Linux distros. All because &quot;Linux is becoming something different than it was&quot;? So, in response to Linux becoming something different, he recommends people switch to something that is utterly different, like an entirely different operating system (FreeBSD, Solaris(!), etc.) or a Linux distribution that rethinks everything, not just the init system (CoreOS).<p>All to avoid something being different. It absolutely boggles my mind, and I have hard time responding with anything other than derision; for that, I apologize.<p>You&#x27;re right that I haven&#x27;t been particularly persuasive, and have been quite abrasive.

Bob would have to bust too many IPs before finding the sender, which could be too expensive.<p>Onion routing begins to fail when Bob has a lot of his own nodes in the Tor network, so for a large enough number of messages he can trace route back to the sender&#x27;s physical address.<p>To achieve real anonymity when chatting with strangers (e.g. blackmarket merchants), one needs to use a combination of these factors:<p>1) Bitmessage or alike to avoid evesdropping.<p>2) Tor to make it harder for recipient to find location of the sender.<p>3) Low-latency network to make statistical analysis less efficient. Every relaying node (both Tor and Bitmessage) should delay broadcasting messages randomly.<p>4) Infrequent communication, so it takes time for recipient to gather data. (This is a variant of #3)<p>5) Change physical location frequently, randomly and rarely reuse them. E.g. connect from various free wi-fi points in cafes, parks, shops, Apple Stores etc.<p>6) Never reuse identity between people you communicate with. Merchants must have separate Bitmessage and Bitcoin address <i>per invoice</i> (once item is sold, post another item with different identity). Buyers must use different Bitmessage and Bitcoin address for each purchase. This way amount of information available to an adversary will be strictly limited to just one deal. And that deal will be limited to one unique location and a few exchanged messages that hopefully won&#x27;t be enough to locate the person. And even if that happens, person couldn&#x27;t be charged with more than one sin.<p>If you communicate with people you trust (friends, family members), you only need #1 and that would be enough.",1416566360

Anywhere you find matter you&#x27;ll find a proportional amount of dark matter, on average; naturally there are variations. There&#x27;s some in between you and your computer monitor right now.<p>The first good indication that dark matter must exist was in fact that the rotation rates of the observable galaxies were too large for the amount of visible mater they contain. Of course the first explanation was that this matter was ordinary gas, dust, rocks, planets (which are just larger dust particles, when compared with the size of even a small galaxy.), etc that wasn&#x27;t emitting any light. However, there would have to be so much of it that it would occlude the distant galaxies, something that obviously isn&#x27;t happening.

Is it right for them to hand out &quot;free&quot; pizza in a box covered with advertising inside and out, and the advertised products get marked up $22 to cover the pizza cost as well as the advertising overhead and collateral costs[1]?  Let me be clear: the customers are getting a pizza that costs $18 for &quot;free&quot;, but $22 is added to the cost of the other goods they buy. They don&#x27;t realize this and the pizza shop is taking advantage of this ignorance.<p>> <i>&quot;And what does it say about you if you want to use a product and not aren&#x27;t willing to pay for it? Not even indirectly via ads?&quot;</i><p>If you&#x27;re referring to me, I&#x27;m totally willing to pay for it. If you mean people in general, they fall into three categories:<p>1. They are willing to pay for it. They wish there weren&#x27;t ads, and switch to ad-free, for-pay products when available.<p>2.  They are willing to pay for it, but are happy to take what <i>appears</i> to be free.<p>3. They are not willing to pay for it, but are happy to take what <i>appears</i> to be free.<p>Both #2 and #3 don&#x27;t realize that instead of being free, it costs a lot more. Or they are too lazy to find a for-pay product. Or they think they don&#x27;t buy advertised products and are happy to mooch off of others.<p>-<p>[1] If I don&#x27;t buy those products, someone else must be, in which case they are subsidizing my pizza. I&#x27;ll bet the effects are regressive, in that people with lower incomes end up subsidizing people with higher. In any case, on average we all pay for the true cost of the &quot;free&quot; product plus the previously mentioned overhead and collateral costs.",1416565193

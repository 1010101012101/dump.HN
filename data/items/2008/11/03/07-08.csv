You see the same dynamic in indie music scenes, people who are happy to play for free at house parties with an audience of mostly other people in bands whose 'day job' is playing music in commercial venues.",1225699102

OK, I'll bite...<p>Perhaps I didn't put enough emphasis on the ""making a scene"" part and didn't <i>explicitly</i> put he was asking about things out of his sphere. He was talking in a very <i>aggressive</i> tone in Spanish <i>after</i> he saw I could speak English fluently, after I showed him both my European and US visas, and after I explained it was a trip to my employer's HQ. He wasn't saying ""como esta amigo"", he was asking random questions that didn't make any sense <i>related to migrations and completely unrelated to customs</i>. I've been many times through different airports in US and <i>never</i> a customs officer asked me those questions. Specially in front of other people. It went on for <i>at least</i> 10 minutes while people were almost walking by in the other queue (including a friend of mine who had to wait and later told me he was thinking in calling the office for help.) I was the only one stopped out of dozens of people, just after he noticed my passport was from south of the border.<p>At that point I decided I rather get rejected from US and perhaps lose my job. And you know, if US rejects your visa, for whatever reason, you never get another one again. Luckily most people present clearly thought the guy was out of line.<p>This random uneducated guy on a power trip surprised me because it happened just a few minutes after maybe the nicest migrations interview I ever had (we even talked about football and his recent holidays in South America while we had to wait for a software reboot of some kind.) This is why I put the ""to be fair"" disclaimer on migrations vs. Customs and TSA/Homeland Security.<p>Normal in exchange with customs on every other country in the world:<p><pre><code>  * In the most common case you just walk.\n  * Second most common, one question: Something to declare?\n  * Worst possible case, rare: Can you please take your luggage over here?</code></pre>",1225698756

Know your competitors inside and out (there will be laptops open during the interview and active googling will be conducted while you're talking), and be able to articulate why you're different.<p>- Be confident in your idea, but also be open to suggestions/recommendations.  Push back if you feel it's necessary, but being open and flexible are traits that YC is looking for.<p>- Anticipate obvious questions and have intelligent answers ready.<p>- Definitely have a demo/prototype.<p>We'll be writing up a more in depth blog post in the next few days on the Anyvite blog, but just wanted to toss some ideas out there now in response to the TS blog post.",1225698375

The cost of supporting an extra customer is quite small in their cases, and being online certainly gives them an advantage over brick and mortars.<p>The problem is that most web startups don't <i>sell</i> anything. They give their most valuable work away for free in the vain hope that showing ads or selling premium accounts will magically rescue them from inevitable collapse.<p>If you're not making any significant amount of money off a single user, it doesn't really matter HOW low your marginal cost is, you're still screwed. I have very little faith in companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, and the such - their per-user costs are ridiculously low, but so is their per-user revenue.",1225696511

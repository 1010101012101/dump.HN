Since race is the only constant in his work as a writer, lawyer, and activist, it isn't hard to extrapolate from there to think that his career as a president will be focused on it, tii.<p>Those 'douchebags' have been pretty well marginalized. Nobody talks about those data when creating race-sensitive laws or corporate policies. I mean, a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist got fired over mentioning that information offhand. It's hardly mainstream if one of the preeminent scientists of the last century can't even afford to speculate about whether or not it might be true.",1199553265

95161,comment,94840,94988,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"<i>I think ""obsession"" is a bit hyperbolic.</i><p>It's the sole constant. When he was a lawyer, he was a race lawyer. When he was a writer, he was a race-writer. When he was an activist, he was a race-activist.<p>I think it would be fair to say that Obama's ethnic background means a lot to him -- look at his senate race against Alan Keyes. Keyes seems to define himself as a rhetorically brilliant ultra-conservative, not as a black man. Even though he's ethnically and culturally much blacker than Obama, and his political career has been with the Republican party, which is notoriously clumsy about racial issues.<p><i>Have you ever been a minority anywhere?</i><p>I lived in Bedford-Stuyvessant for a while. It wasn't exactly pleasant, but I don't plan on spending my entire professional career getting over strangers referring to me as ""White boy!"" or jumping me for my iPod.<p><i>Yes, it is very pro-black and pro-African, but I don't see anything that is explicitly ""anti"" anyone else.</i><p>Many hate groups are not explicitly 'anti' anyone. You don't have to hear much about how someone ""Favors preserving the White culture, and the White people as a race..."" to know that you're hearing about the Klan.<p><i>Would be interested to see the welcome for a white person walking in on Sunday, though. :) Having said that, I did go to a church once where ours was the only white family among black Haitian immigrants.</i><p>I've attended the ""Rock Church"" in St. Louis (<a href=""http://www.stalphonsusrock.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stalphonsusrock.org/</a>), which is quite an experience. But they don't have to push a black power message to follow a Christian message as blacks.",1199553078

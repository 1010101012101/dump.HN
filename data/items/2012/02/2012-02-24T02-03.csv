3627801,comment,3627389,3627389,12,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"Just Tuesaday, I sent an email around the company discussing SSL vulnerabilities, how they impact our product, and ways we can mitigate that.  I've pulled out the parts specific to our product, but the rest may be interesting. I would love feedback on things I may have missed. FWIW, it doesn't instill great confidence in SSL, but it isn't completely horrible.
------------------------
1. It is possible to pretend to be any site you want if you 1) find a sleezy CA (and they exist aplenty) or get the government involved and 2) can get between your browser and your final destination (like, for example, a wifi hotspot). There will be no way (reasonable) way to tell you aren't connected to whom you think you are.<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/packet-forensics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/packet-forensics/</a><p>This could be addressed using <a href=""http://convergence.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://convergence.io/</a><p>2. Way easier, but leaving some tell-tale signs you can find is to simply put yourself between your victim's browser and his server and convert all the links that come back to be insecure links that go through you. You then encrypt them as you pass them on to their final destination, while being able to see everything that happens. This is trivial to set up, but can be gotten around simply by using bookmarks that specify HTTPS.<p><a href=""http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/</a><p>This won't go away until everybody is using 100% SSL and HTTP (unencrypted web traffic) is turned off in browsers.<p>DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING ANYTHING OVER AN UNSECURED NETWORK IS ALWAYS A BAD IDEA.<p>3. For the very determined, it is possible to determine the symmetric key a particular SSL session is using if you have some luck, some skill, and some time (about 30 minutes).<p><a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/09/man-in-the-midd_4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/09/man-in-the-mid...</a><p>This requires a protocol change to SSL. We've known about (theoretical) vulnerabilities for 10 years, yet most sites still run old versions of SSL. Given how slowly people like banks update infrastructure technology, I don't see this one going away for a long time.<p>4. If a site is improperly configured, it may allow an attacker to gain access to the cookie representing your secure session by making an insecure request. This is another class of vulnerabilities made possible by using untrusted networks. The misconfiguration allows the browser to send your (supposedly) secure cookies in an unsecured request simply by making any request (typically done by inserting JavaScript into an unsecured page you are browsing). It is possible to mark cookies as ""secure only"", but services will choose not do that so you don't lose your session if you type <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com</a> instead of <a href=""https://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com</a>.<p><a href=""http://fscked.org/blog/cookiemonster-core-logic-configuration-and-readmes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fscked.org/blog/cookiemonster-core-logic-configuratio...</a>",1330052149

What argument do you have against doing this?<p>Turn this around.  What's the argument <i>for</i> doing it?  ""The gain using our proposed initial dictionary is seen only for the first header"".  This is completely counter to the goal of Spdy to keep connections open and reuse them; the longer connections are used the less the initial dictionary matters.<p>Even just visiting one page, average say 500 KiB, it save on average 121 bytes total.  That's 0.02% reduction in size.  This seems like a ""substantial win""?<p>Meanwhile how many version of the dictionary are there so far?  5?  10? And they propose that it will evolve over time, so that will just keep growing with software everywhere having dozens of legacy dictionaries.<p>> Also, HTTP pipelining requires answering requests in order, while SPDY doesn't, allowing the server to respond to requests as data becomes available.<p>This is why metrics are important.  By ignoring pipelining because of perceived problems, the authors are basing their protocol on assumptions.  This assumption is that in the real world the 'head of line blocking' is a significant factor.  Judging by 0.02% average gain from prefix dictionaries, I don't give them the benefit of the doubt that their assumptions are correct.  But I see that Chrome 17 has some type of pipelining support, so maybe they will actually test this someday.<p>> If I request a page generated by an expensive CGI, the server can go ahead and send me the CSS and JavaScript it knows all pages will reference ...<p>Yes if the very first request is an expensive CGI this may be some marginal benefit.  I think even the Spdy designers claimed this was less than 1% and sometimes a loss.  This happens very often, that the first page requested from a site has some really slow loading CGI?

(Assuming, of course, reasonably secure encryption technology, &c.) You're not incriminating yourself by giving them the plaintext; they <i>already know</i> you have it, whether through confession, third party testimony, or some other means.<p>What the court is saying here, OTOH, is that it would be <i>testimonial</i>, and hence subject to 5th Amendment protection, for you to decrypt a drive the prosecution merely <i>suspects</i> to contain inculpatory evidence, however strong their argument for suspecting such evidence to exist (and they'll have much better arguments than, ""Well, drive is big enough to hold millions of files...""). If they were to find any such evidence, they'd have found it through compelling you to provide it to them, and that's the thing they're saying is counter to the 5th Amendment  that, in providing them with evidence they didn't already <i>specifically</i> know to exist, you've incriminated yourself.",1330049264

Ugh.  Thinking about going back to that workflow makes me physically ill.<p>Git (as Linus says) is a STUPID content tracker.  99.9% of the time when I'm working on source code, git allowing me to do stable, local ""bookmarks"", keep multiple local branches (and local history) active simultaneously, and keep all my content tracked... Git has its flaws and warts but don't seriously suggest that ""svn diff > ~/working-on-foo.patch"" is a valid workflow.  That's bringing a knife to a gunfight.<p>I suggest that if you can understand a linked list, you can understand git. And if you're a programmer that can't understand a linked list... well... print out your ""cheat sheet"", here's a copy of Tortoise, and commit your code to a branch before it gets approved for main-line.",1330049000

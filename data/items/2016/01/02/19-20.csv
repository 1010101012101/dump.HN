10827620,comment,10826838,10826838,0,0,laurencerowe,,,"> The most common mistake people make about economic inequality is to treat it as a single phenomenon. The most naive version of which is the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by taking money from the poor.<p>For most of us, our largest single expense is housing, whether that be rent or mortgage repayments. Supply of housing is quite inelastic, something that should be clear to all of us who live in California, New York, or London.<p>By driving up the costs of homes, those of us who have more to spend are driving those who have less further out from the urban centres where the jobs are found, reducing their leisure by forcing them to spend more time commuting instead of with their families.<p>While the cost of manufactures has been falling as the economy grows, food - the other major expense for the poor and middle class, has also seen much higher inflation than the headline figures.<p>Entrepreneurial progress <i>is</i> a great thing. But we need to recognise that for many, the &#x27;pie fallacy&#x27; really isn&#x27;t a fallacy. For someone on the median income, a reduced share of total earnings is materially increasing deprivation.<p>The biggest thing we could do to increase entrepreneurialism would be to redistribute more and make more people feel secure. It&#x27;s much easier to take risks when you have the security of parental wealth.",1451764728

A classical example of « the naturalistic fallacy » [0].<p>Also, it&#x27;s also worrying the degree of infatuation or affection for the early 20th century years with central planning of the economy, crony capitalism, robber barons, an all-powerful big government, centralization and concentration of power at the hands of a few, regimented and uniformed society ...etc.<p>No leftie is arguing or longing for any of these policies. What we&#x27;re looking for is just more equality in economic opportunities and esp capital and that distribution of capital to be more fair across all the classes and not to be a privilege only for rich and highly connected people.<p>That&#x27;s how we envision the solution to fix this problem of &quot;fragmentation&quot; as he put when it exactly is more like a &quot;segregation&quot; problem but not based on racial or cultural factors but on economic one into two completely separate societies between the haves and have-nots, between the 1% and the 99% of the population and it&#x27;s getting worse and uglier by the day.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy</a>",1451764419

So a better example would be that you pay someone on craigslist for a service, e.g. paint your house. If the painter works full time painting houses and still needs welfare, then the taxpayers are basically subsidizing house painting (&quot;conduit of welfare&quot; as it was phrased).

So the &quot;rising tide raises all boats&quot; meme is a nice metaphor but empirically just pure nonsense.<p>Furthermore, even the very rich in the more unequal societies are, in many aspects that matter, worse off than average people in more equal societies, even though they are much weather individually.

I see this need as things get out of control quickly on hn due to hype and links like this jump to get 1k votes, where most of the voters simply vote because others voted.<p>For those who do not know, since just before the Iranian disputed elections of 2009, Hossein Derakhshan has been living in Iran. He was &#x27;supposedly&#x27; in jail, but there were rumors about his collaboration with the Iranian government to build their cyber presence, which almost did not exist at the time. Shortly after his arrest, many anti government bloggers inside Iran were arrested too, there are speculations that he revealed their identities.<p>Years before entering Iran, Derakhshan was busy with &#x27;blogfathering&#x27; Iranian web space for a few years, explicitly being anti Iranian government, which always bring visitors. This way, at the rise of the weblog era, he was doing good. He had a big number of visitors which could make him enough money to not look for another job.<p>During post golden era of weblogs, specially when the Iranian Digg copy websites appeared, his monopoly weblog business was going south. At that point, he started publishing more unconventional content in Iranian web space to gain attention. Mostly, they were of sexual nature. A good example is a video he published where he asks an Israeli girl to repeat graphic sexual words in Farsi (Persian) after him. The girl did not speak a word of that language. Another example is his dedicated website to naked pictures of Monica Bellucci.<p>I am not writing this to reveal that Hossein Derakhshan is a successful web attention seeker. I am writing this to let you know that in summer of 2009, when our tiny team was trying to protect huge DDoS attacks on a handful of low budget EC2 instances funded by donations, we were convinced that on the other side of the line, Mr Derakhshan had made a deal to conduct the operations by hiring Russians. This was by tracing his old account on our website to multiple new accounts claiming how they enjoy taking down the website, and let me tell you this, if you write thousands of lines on the web with your identity, it is not easy to escape your writing style when you pretend to be someone else.<p>Another elections is coming in a couple of months in Iran, where the government allows high profile media to report from inside Iran, hence this article pop up out of no where. This is a known pattern.<p>I had to get this off my chest after so many year. It is disturbing to see links like this on the front page of hn, where people claim to be pro democracy and freedom. This hurts.",1451763649

Yes, C++ is known for being fast while suffering from a shortage of easy libraries and being more verbose to write and intellectually challenging to write in, while the mainstream dynamic languages are known for being not so fast but having a vast array of handy, easy to integrate libraries and being fast to develop in. But I think there&#x27;s a number of choices between the two that seem worth considering.<p>C#/.NET doesn&#x27;t get a lot of love from the startup community, but it&#x27;s mature, stable, fast, full of advanced features, and has good library support.<p>Java and other JVM languages have similar advantages and better compatibility with Unix-based OSes. Java itself is a little long in the tooth, but there is the option of alternate JVM languages.<p>I&#x27;d probably be most tempted to check out Go if I was working on something that absolutely had to wring the best possible performance out of my hardware. I don&#x27;t honestly know that much about it, but it has a reputation for getting you most of the performance of C++ without the complexity.<p>But I will say that if the author has lots of experience in C++ and comfort with the ecosystem, and not much in any of those other languages, then by all means go with C++.

(Ability is what you can do, whereas opportunity relates to markets, regulation, social capital, etc.)<p>My argument is that everyone has the same 15 or 20 basic human needs, and increasingly each of those needs is being met by two or three global corporations, as opposed to two or three local or national companies. Which means that even if you as the individual are more talented or whatever, there is actually less opportunity to use those talents to fulfill human needs at scale in a profitable way. That&#x27;s why such a large percentage of employees today work low wage jobs in the service industry, as opposed to physical/digital manufacturing.<p>And network effects are only one way in which technology has decreased opportunity. Another is environmental degradation. E.g. 300 years ago anyone in manhattan could feed themselves just being sticking their arm in the Hudson river. But now all 100% of those (edible) fish are gone, and all the profits that were made from dumping industrial chemicals into the river have been privatized by the wealthy.<p>A third way is legal regulation. Every time a new technology comes onto the market the government has to regulate, which often shuts out everyone except the super wealthy from competing. (Want to start a cell phone company? Good luck with that.)<p>There are more one-in-a-million lottery ticket opportunities than ever before. But for the average person, there is actually much less opportunity for them to be successful. And not just less wealthy relative to the rich because the rich can gather sticks faster or whatever, but less wealthy on an absolute scale because there are no sticks left to gather.<p>It&#x27;s nice to talk about making furniture and fixing up cars or whatever, but I think the number of fortunes that have actually been created by making wealth without externalizing massive costs onto the poor and middle class are probably few and far between.",1451763504

Research has firmly established that this dynamic process is vital to productivity and sustained economic growth. Entrepreneurs play a critical role in this process, and in net job creation. But recent research shows that dynamism is slowing down. Business churning and new firm formations have been on a persistent decline during the last few decades, and the pace of net job creation has been  subdued. This decline has been documented across a broad range of sectors in the U.S. economy, even in\nhigh-tech.&quot;<p>And here is the start of the first:<p>&quot;The pace of business dynamism in the U.S. has declined over recent decades. The decline in business dynamism is evident in a pronounced declining trend in the pace of both gross job creation and gross job destruction.

The decline in the startup rate has yielded a significant decline in the share of employment accounted for by young firms – this share has declined by almost 30 percent over the last 30 years. &quot;<p>And please, please, please note that a country can have an incredibly dynamic, innovative industry, but that nation can still be in long-term decline.

In fact the argument for allowing them to make profits from the company seems to rest on the argument that they <i>should</i> value shareholder value. An alternative approach would be, once the CEO&#x27;s shares are worth $500M, they should start to increase salaries or issue shares to their employees or donate to charity or something, such that their personal ownership interest remains valued at $500M but they retain creative control (which they wouldn&#x27;t if they let it go public).

The 1960s physicist was creating wealth they couldn&#x27;t capture, while the 1990s physicist was capturing wealth they didn&#x27;t create. If physicists (and other Ivey grads) all only chose wealth-creation, we&#x27;d see far less inequality (at least outside the Bay Area). The trouble is the pull of the largely zero-sum (or negative-sum) world of finance, which more than startups has increased the pressure to &quot;make your fortune&quot;. Inequality begets more inequality, because when half my cohort is suddenly making 10x more than me, there are real consequences to my own social, personal, and civic life.<p>This is all on top of the relatively novel wealth imperative introduced by the progress of biotech. It used to be that, beyond a certain point, money only really conferred social status (and even then, only within a certain peer group): if I don&#x27;t care about status within that particular group, then why should I care about making more than (say) $200k/year? Except now, with the rapid development of fancy unaffordable therapies and med-tech devices, having an extra 10 million $ lying around can have a much larger impact on quality of life than it did even a couple decades ago. And then there&#x27;s the significant (if small) possibility that, if Kurzweil + co. end up being right, a bit more wealth might mean being able to &quot;live long enough to live forever&quot;.<p>Current tax policy is heavily skewed in favor of the already wealthy, and wealth inequality is currently orders of magnitude worse than income inequality. So rather than just asking everyone to get comfortable with it, why not do something to actually address it? We need to make significant adjustments to (a) strongly discourage rent-seeking, (b) encourage those with the highest technological leverage to make the most of their talents, knowledge, and access, and (c) greatly increase everyone&#x27;s ability to create, capture, and save wealth.",1451763402

10827514,comment,10826838,10826838,0,0,analtaccount,,,"I have two points against this piece. The first in substance and the second in style.<p>> The real problem is poverty, not economic inequality.<p>This was in the footnote, and I will consider it, hopefully without creating a strawman, to be the boiled-down thesis.<p>Economic inequality and poverty are different problems, as PG noted, and both will never truly be solved barring dramatic and horrific solutions. But, the people I know, aren&#x27;t talking about poverty. My friends, all of whom grew up in middle class life styles, aren&#x27;t thinking about falling into poverty, which they consider to be the idea of barely making ends meet. They&#x27;re thinking about why they can&#x27;t afford to buy a house at age 30 like their parents did. Or why they have to put off having a kid until they&#x27;re much older. Or why wages don&#x27;t seem to give as much disposable income as they once did. Or why they&#x27;re so in debt right after college, without a good job to speak for.<p>They&#x27;re talking about the end of the middle class. And, while poverty swells from the middle class&#x27;s withering, we can&#x27;t just focus on its growth. It&#x27;s like if you had three buildings. The first is tiny and barebones. The second is nicer and much larger. And the third is super glitzy but the smallest of all. Now imagine that neglect by the building owners has lit aflame the second building. Most people from the second building  are now forced to overcrowd into the dilapidated first building.<p>People in the first building exclaim that we need more room. People in the third building close their blinds. The people in the second building are too proud to admit they have to stay in the first building.<p>Meanwhile, the second building turns to ash. And then the first and third buildings right next to the second start to catch on fire...<p>Metaphor aside, I believe the real problem is the withering of the middle class, i.e. where opportunity is most equal. It is the engine of our society and, in the economic view, probably what has made the West great.<p>While I do not know what set of specifics solution will work, I do know that, paraphrasing PG, the most important thing is to focus on the right problem.<p>Style:\n> So when I hear people saying that economic inequality is bad and should be eliminated, I feel rather like a wild animal overhearing a conversation between hunters. But the thing that strikes me most about the conversations I overhear is how confused they are. They don&#x27;t even seem clear whether they want to kill me or not.<p>This paragraph set a dubious tone, and made me seriously question the objectivity of this piece.<p>I completely believe that PG has heard of these conversations: as a high-net-worth person, he must have been accused of exploitation and other capitalist ills a thousand times over.<p>But by including this paragraph, the spectrum stretches from &quot;reducing income inequality&quot; to &quot;ending income equality&quot;, which portends violence. Not metaphorical violence. Real violence. PG is studied in history, so his words about death strike me as not apart of a metaphor but a real, sincere worry.<p>There&#x27;s fear here; fear seems to be slightly and subtly tinging the rest of the essay. I appreciate PG&#x27;s  methodical, calm, purposeful writing. But the tone of this one clouds the message of &quot;treat the disease, not the symptom&quot;.<p>I agree with a lot of what is said later on, but I had to do outside research first, and then coming back once I was sure I wouldn&#x27;t be learning a distorted point or view.<p>Normally PG&#x27;s editors are great at refining his words: but out of all them, only one seems to be studied in Income Equality (Max Roser). The others are either apart of the same class or social cohort: which may very well be why the general consensus from his editors was that this piece should go out as we see it now.",1451763208

And I mean that in a downward way, until the mid 00&#x27;s we were converging, since then we have been diverging with the &#x27;08 crisis as one catalyst and the whole nationalist resurgence as another. Add a couple of million refugees as a convenient scapegoat and the stage is set.

One of the reasons the anti-war sentiment in Europe was so strong in the 1970&#x27;s and early 1980&#x27;s is that we were under no illusion what would be the battle field, today the fact that we have the illusion that the battlefield would be anywhere but here is what endangers us more than anything.

For decades the major source for that was the various mostly youth oriented subcultures that made up what we called the counterculture. Hippies, punks, goths, 80s rockers, hip hop, ravers, geek fandom, and a dozen smaller variants provided something that... well... wasn&#x27;t &quot;red delicious.&quot;<p>Those things still exist but today they feel more like just another culture in the marketplace. They no longer seem to have such potency or power. Maybe I&#x27;m just old but I get the strong sense this is true for young people too. Today young people might visit these little subcultures as tourists, but when I grew up they were a much bigger deal. They became your identity. They were almost religious, like modern mystery cults.<p>Rave was probably the last great youth counterculture. I haven&#x27;t noticed another one unless you count the &quot;hipster&quot; artisan living thing and that seems more like a lifestyle brand than a true counterculture of the postwar music+fashion+drugs+ideas mold.<p>In retrospect those subcultures were more like alternative conformity molds. They didn&#x27;t really alter the underlying zeitgeist of conformity but just provided another channel on the cultural TV dial. Still I do mourn them a bit. Their greatest legacy was as artistic and musical crucibles and nothing has really replaced them. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that there has been no major musical innovation since the 90s. There has been good music but it all follows stylistic currents set down before 2000. Rave gave us techno and all its various sub-forms and... that&#x27;s apparently the end of history music-wise.<p>Edit: would be curious to hear a counterpoint on the last item.

You and I are in the fortunate positions of being able to service debt and even avoid it entirely. Many people are not. Lenders have the ability to take advantage of social and financial systems that require debt, and through the application of their profits can alter those systems so that more debt is required to survive. In my mind, that is capitalism&#x27;s failure. Spending your future earning potential is fine, buy a boat or a house bigger than you need if you want to, but if you need to go into debt for employment, education, or health care as many in the U.S. do now then something is very wrong. Furthermore, servicing that debt can keep people stuck in debt or poverty and reducing their spending potential, which is destructive to the economy.

You still pay normal market price.<p>The contract was for 2 years. After 2 years you can call &#x27;m up and cancel, or renew at a new price. If you don&#x27;t do anything, they won&#x27;t cut your service (which makes sense, that&#x27;d leave a lot of customers surprised 2 years in), but they&#x27;ll &#x27;silently renew&#x27; the contract every month indefinitely, until you cancel. So you&#x27;re not actually tied into anything after those 2 years.<p>But the shitty thing is this... after 2 years, the &#x27;discount&#x27; price ends, and you end up paying the $400 rate.<p>Not just that, but the original $100 &#x27;discount&#x27; rate (the normal market rate at the time, btw), was for connectivity + a phone, because I got a free iPhone included. Obviously it&#x27;s not free, it was just priced into the $100 contract.<p>Plus, after 2 years the market rate of the connectivity + phone dropped from $100 to $50, the connectivity itself cost only something like $30.<p>So instead of paying $30, I was paying $400. I was never called up or something to discuss my options, they simply executed a silent agreement we made in 2013 in tiny letters.<p>I made up the numbers btw, they&#x27;re not as shocking but in the past 7 months I ended up paying $250 more than I should have.

I wrote a full response at <a href=""http://cryoshon.co/2016/01/02/a-response-to-paul-grahams-article-on-income-inequality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryoshon.co/2016/01/02/a-response-to-paul-grahams-art...</a>.<p>I&#x27;ve abridged some of my comments/quotations for this comment.<p>Let&#x27;s break it down bit by bit:<p>FTA:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m interested in the topic because I am a manufacturer of economic inequality.&quot;<p>Well, not quite. The throughput of successful startup folks is never going to be enough to make a dent in the economy&#x27;s general state of inequality. If anything, YC offers social mobility insurance; the potential for social mobility from the middle classes to the lower-upper class without the potential for a slip from the middle classes to the lower classes in the event of failure.<p>&quot;The most common mistake people make about economic inequality is to treat it as a single phenomenon. The most naive version of which is the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by taking money from the poor.&quot;<p>Well, &quot;taking&quot; is a bit biased, but broadly speaking, it&#x27;s true that the poor must buy or rent what the rich are offering in order to survive. This means that the poor are at the whim of the rich unless they choose to grow their own food and live pastorally, which isn&#x27;t desirable. People pay rent if they&#x27;re poor, and collect rent if they&#x27;re rich. The poor sell their labor, whereas the rich buy labor in order to utilize their capital, which the poor have none of. These are traits of capitalism rather than anything to get upset about. People get upset when the rich use their oversized political influence to get laws passed to their benefit; over time, the rich make more money due to their ability to manipulate the political system.<p>&quot;...those at the top are grabbing an increasing fraction of the nation&#x27;s income—so much of a larger share that what&#x27;s left over for the rest is diminished....&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/</a> Check out these charts... the data is much-discussed because they are unimpeachable.<p>&quot;In the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it from others. A woodworker creates wealth. He makes a chair, and you willingly give him money in return for it. A high-frequency trader does not. He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of a trade loses a dollar.<p>If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from the poor, then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality where the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth. But instances of inequality don&#x27;t have to be instances of the degenerate case. If one woodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none, the second woodworker will have less money, but not because anyone took anything from him.&quot;<p>The woodworker works in a wood shop, not alone. The owner of the wood shop has decided that if 5 chairs are sold, it takes 2 chairs worth of money to recoup the costs of making the chair. With three chairs worth of money remaining, he takes two and three fourths chairs for himself and distributes the remaining amount to the worker who created the chair. The woodworker created the wealth by using the owner&#x27;s capital, and so the owner of the capital gets the vast majority of the wealth generated, even though he didn&#x27;t actually make the chairs himself. Is the owner &quot;taking&quot; from his employee? No, the employee has merely realized that one fourth of one chair&#x27;s income is the standard amount that a woodworker can get from working in a shop owned by someone else, and happened to choose this particular shop to work in. &quot;Taking&quot; is the wrong word; &quot;greed&quot; is the proper word. The proportion of revenue derived from capital that is returned to workers selling their labor is far too low. The woodworkers can&#x27;t simultaneously pay off their woodworking school loans, apartment rent, and care for their children on the wages they&#x27;re offered.<p>&quot;If you want to understand change in economic inequality, you should ask what those people would have done when it was different. This is one way I know the rich aren&#x27;t all getting richer simply from some sinister new system for transferring wealth to them from everyone else. When you use the would-have method with startup founders, you find what most would have done back in 1960, when economic inequality was lower, was to join big companies or become professors.&quot;<p>Not even close. The richest hundred people have gotten wildly richer as a result of crony capitalism in which the richest are able to bend the political system to their will via overt bribery, creating unfair advantages for their ventures and endless loopholes for their personal wealth to avoid taxation. The ventures of the very rich are given unearned integration into political life, again making them a shoe in for special treatment. Remember how the failing banks in the financial crisis were considered too big to fail, and were accommodated at the public&#x27;s expense? This kind of behavior insures the rich&#x27;s safety with the money culled from the poor. Information technology is a gold rush, and creates rich people by forging new vehicles of capital-- generating wealth. The economics of a gold rush are quite clear, but PG forgets that the vast, vast majority of the workers in the economy are not participating in the gold rush, nor could they.<p>&quot;And that group presents two problems for the hunter of economic inequality. One is that variation in productivity is accelerating. The rate at which individuals can create wealth depends on the technology available to them, and that grows polynomially. The other problem with creating wealth, as a source of inequality, is that it can expand to accommodate a lot of people.&quot;<p>Productivity has been increasing for decades, and at one point in time, wages tracked productivity. The relationship between wages and productivity fell apart. This means that the business owners were benefiting from increased worker productivity, but the workers were not benefiting... another cause of economic inequality that can be attributed directly to the owners not allowing enough money to go to their workers. If productivity is accelerating, wages should be too. Rather than understanding workers as slaves that require a dole as they are presently, they must be considered as close partners in economic production.<p>&quot;Most people who get rich tend to be fairly driven. Whatever their other flaws, laziness is usually not one of them. Suppose new policies make it hard to make a fortune in finance. Does it seem plausible that the people who currently go into finance to make their fortunes will continue to do so but be content to work for ordinary salaries? The reason they go into finance is not because they love finance but because they want to get rich. If the only way left to get rich is to start startups, they&#x27;ll start startups.&quot;<p>Once again: the current flap about economic inequality is not about people wanting to become rich, it is about people wanting to get by. Most people are not driven. Everyone wants to at least get by. You will not stop people from being driven to become rich by making it possible for everyone else to get by.<p>&quot;So let&#x27;s be clear about that. Ending economic inequality would mean ending startups. Are you sure, hunters, that you want to shoot this particular animal? It would only mean you eliminated startups in your own country. Ambitious people already move halfway around the world to further their careers, and startups can operate from anywhere nowadays. So if you made it impossible to get rich by creating wealth in your country, the ambitious people in your country would just leave and do it somewhere else. Which would certainly get you a lower Gini coefficient, along with a lesson in being careful what you ask for. &quot;<p>No, it wouldn&#x27;t. There is lower and higher economic inequality in many places in the world, and many of those places have startups. There is nothing special about startups, and startups persist whether or not the society is extremely unequal. There are startups in Sweden. There are startups in China. There are startups in Nigeria. There are startups in Denmark. There is absolutely no reason to be prideful in the American startup phenomenon if it requires people living in poverty-- I do not believe that it does require this, though.<p>&quot;Notice how novel it feels to think about that. The public conversation so far has been exclusively about the need to decrease economic inequality. We&#x27;ve barely given a thought to how to live with it.&quot;<p>Living with economic inequality is precarious and uncomfortable for the majority of the population, but it is comfortable for the rich.<p>Is this what PG thinks is okay?",1451762571

The chain of identity proofing for a traditional driver&#x27;s license involves both &quot;who is the person who holds this document?&quot;, &quot;how do I know the document is trustworthy?&quot; (i.e., not a forgery), and to a lesser extent &quot;is the information on this document accurate?&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine how a bar or venue would be able to rely on an electronic record of a license displayed on a device that is not under the venue&#x27;s control.  Physical driver&#x27;s licenses have anti-counterfeiting measures such as holograms or secondary shadow photos of the bearer that require more than just a good laser printer to fake.  It would be trivial to write an app that faked all the functionality of a license that I show the bouncer on my phone, so they would be unable to rely on it to answer &quot;is the information being displayed [age, name] accurate?&quot; without some sort of additional transaction with the central license database to verify the license.  Such an additional transaction would add a lot of friction to the simple act of flashing a license at a bouncer or bartender, with all sorts of potential for outages (see, e.g., Virginia&#x27;s IT outages since they outsourced the state IT en toto to Northrop--DMV&#x27;s unavailable for days at a time).  If you owned a business, would you allow your ability to even be open on any given day dependent on whether your state was managing their data access well enough to be available (and with low enough latency to the transaction not to interfere with running your business)?  That&#x27;s just one slice of business, and I haven&#x27;t even gone into potential issues of the data trail such transactions would create, or the heightened damage identity theft would pose, or the immaturity and blindspots in government identity management policy development.<p>I think governments should absolutely be exploring ways to make data like identity-proofing via driver&#x27;s licenses widely accessible via services for use by citizens and businesses, but even there I&#x27;m a bit skeptical as most organizations are horrible at controlling access to sensitive information even at the internal level, much less making it available via an API.  TSA PreCheck (the vendor&#x27;s relevant experience) is such a different beast in it&#x27;s use case from a broad credential like a driver&#x27;s license that it&#x27;s hard not to expect gaping security and policy issues to emerge as they start to roll these out.<p>I geek out about identity tech, use 2FA wherever I can, do this professionally, and am currently wrestling with a couple of Yubikeys for even more 2FA fun, but I can&#x27;t imagine opting in to an electronic driver&#x27;s license, and if anyone asked me I&#x27;d vehemently advise against it.",1451762300

Would the good done to people on the lower end of the scale not outweigh any possible harm here? That seems hard to imagine.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re imagining it on the wrong time scale.<p>If you say Larry Page can &quot;only&quot; make an effective maximum of $500M, that isn&#x27;t going to stop him founding Google, but what does it do once he actually has $500M? He owns shares in his company that have grown to be worth $40B so then he owes the government ~$39.5B in taxes. So he effectively has to sell his company to pay his taxes. (And if he doesn&#x27;t have to pay the tax until he sells the shares then he never will and your tax plan fails.)<p>Before the tax he was going to keep most of the shares and thereby have control of the company. The primary difference caused is therefore that more large corporations will be publicly rather than privately controlled. So the assumption has to be that that will somehow lead to higher incomes and standard of living for the middle class.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Publicly traded companies have no soul. The CEO&#x27;s job in a publicly traded company is &quot;maximize shareholder value&quot; and that means grinding competitors&#x27; bones into dusty by squeezing every cent out of your customers, suppliers and employees. The people being squeezed are the middle class.<p>At least if the company is controlled by a human person you can have Henry Ford saying his employees should get paid enough to afford his products. A company&#x27;s owner is the only one who is authorized to decide that there is something more important than shareholder value.<p>The problem with today&#x27;s economy is that that isn&#x27;t happening often enough, in large part because too many major companies are publicly traded.

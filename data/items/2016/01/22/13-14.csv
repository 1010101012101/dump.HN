10952695,comment,10922774,10936032,0,0,norea-armozel,,,"Yea, Wichita is a complete mess right now. I believe the current mayor of Wichita had an ad done regarding the failed sales tax hike (1%) which he described the average growth rate of Wichita from 1990 to 2000 and then 2001 to 2011. In the 90s we were growing at about 10% per year on average but the scary thing was the 1% growth per year in the 2000s. I know this is the truth too because I believe right now between Cessna and Beechcraft there&#x27;s about 4k workers when in the past those two employers could easily field that much individually.<p>Things aren&#x27;t improving either since Brownback seems to be happy enough with companies leaving the state despite the low taxes because he and his ilk refused to acknowledge that the major corps wanted well educated workers and have on many occasions worked with Wichita State University to improve their programs. It&#x27;s why I left more than anything. The anti-LGBT sentiment is bad, but having no jobs in my field is worse.<p>Edit: I believe it wasn&#x27;t an ad, but actually an Op-Ed pinned by Carl Brewer that gave the numbers I described on the growth rates.",1453471157

Less inflammation = could train again the next day! Pound down that Advil at the end of your workout so you are ready to go!<p>Over the last few years, it seems more and more people are saying &quot;The inflammation process is what makes your body stronger - you can&#x27;t stop it without losing the benefits!&quot;<p>On the other hand, I do still see inflammation stopping treatments around. i.e. football players after a game getting into basically a freezer for 15 seconds to reduce muscle inflammation.

There are very few times when I&#x27;ve had to evaluate a mobile app for more than 5-10 minutes to decide whether or not it was worth the price of admission. A 15-30 minute window is a good compromise to trials, since it weeds out the folks who were never going to pay for the app <i>anyway</i> and doesn&#x27;t require any significant risk on the side of the developer. No need to spend resources on developing special trial versions, and little risk that people will try the app, get the value out of it, then immediately refund. (Games with limited time of play, short stories, that kind of thing.)<p>Refunds post the window (but probably within some other window, like 30-90 days or so) should probably still be possible, but I&#x27;d be ok with those kinds of refunds requiring a higher barrier to entry – even if it is just filling out some forms.

They have a wikipage arguing against trackbacks on <a href=""https://indiewebcamp.com/Trackback"" rel=""nofollow"">https://indiewebcamp.com/Trackback</a>, and all points on that page are wrong when looking at how blog engines actually implement trackbacks. Just take the first, fragile discovery: The critic is that the RDF comment needed for Trackbacks is is complex and get stripped. But frankly, it is not complex to grep for it and if you can&#x27;t control your own page HTML to preserve comments, you have different problems (and one that could hit your microformat equally). More important: Trackbacks actually can be found via a rel-tag in the site head exactly like pingbacks (and I guess webmentions), rel=trackback.<p>And of course blog engines verify that the origin really has a link to the receiving page, the spam problem is solved there exactly like with webmentions.<p>What should be done is to take trackbacks and formalize the current solutions and extensions into a formal protocol.

Especially for smaller medical concerns (not sleeping well, aches, mild anxiety), doctors usually cannot really help. Medical intervention generally does not make sense until something is really wrong, and a proper exercise habit is a very good way to help prevent many types of conditions. Before I had experience with doctors, I thought they would be able to solve any medical problems, but I learned the hard way that with many problems they often cannot help a significant amount, if at all. Medicine is still a very crude science. Plus, it would be a folly to think a doctor cares as much about your health as you do.

The material on pages 691-693 is all background material, not the actual research material of this paper.<p>I did read 691-693. I am not contradicting any of the information in it; merely saying that I think they are overstating the direct superiority of the longbow. Strategically and tactically, it&#x27;s clear that arming a large number of archers and using them in the early battle is superior, and the cost and simplicity of the longbow makes that much easier; but it&#x27;s not because a single longbow is better than a single crossbow. I think that the longbow was a superior weapon, in the sense that the armies that adopted the longbow strategy clearly beat those that relied on crossbows, but I think that the way that the paper couches its introduction makes it sound like, side by side, a longbow was a superior weapon to a crossbow.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about modern crossbows, I&#x27;m talking about reproduction medieval crossbows. I do medieval recreation as a hobby, I shoot longbow, I know people who shoot crossbow. The longbow is faster, though as I mention, I know people who can reload and shoot from the hip and get 6 accurate shots off in 30 seconds. And the crossbow is more accurate, gets better range, delivers more power, and is easier to shoot.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t shoot a 160 pound warbow, I don&#x27;t have the strength for it. If I did, I would get some more power and range out of it, at the expense of accuracy and speed, as I would fatigue much more quickly. With a crossbow, you can use both arms and brace against your hip to draw, so even without any stirrup or crank, you can shoot a much heavier crossbow than you could a longbow. That extra power means more penetrating power and a flatter quicker flight (or more range if you increase your angle), and the fact that your muscles are not straining to hold the bow drawn means you can aim more accurately.",1453468496

The last use of trained english longbowmen seemed to have been by some of the royalists during the English Civil War, and after the parliamentary victory practical knowledge of longbow archery as a military arm had been lost without anyone really noticing.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine a pivotal art or technology being lost like that, but I&#x27;m willing to bet its not at all uncommon if we look across history. For another military technology example, the art of dogfighting was deemed to have been lost for a brief period between WWII and the air war over Vietnam, and had to be re-engineered.<p>[1] <a href=""http://everything.explained.today/English_longbow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everything.explained.today/English_longbow/</a>",1453468009

Although this point of view might be a bit simplified, there&#x27;s another example of a weapon, which was both relatively cheap to make - and really hard to use unless the whole society was built around the skills required to use it.<p>Mongols! Light cavalry using composite bows was both unbelievably effective and hard to copy for everybody but steppe nomads. All Mongols were hunters, they practically lived with their bows on their horses. So the whole population could do warfare.<p>While back in the days, in both Eastern and Western Europe, contemporary warfare was rotating around heavy cavalry, and one can&#x27;t have too many knights. Even if somebody managed to gather an army more or less comparable to Mongol hordes - heavier cavalry would just be meat for lighter riders making circles around them.<p>Besides, feudal lands never managed to be centralized enough to counter mongols.

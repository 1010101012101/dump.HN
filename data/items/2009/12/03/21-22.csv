Where do you think their motivation is coming from (to make the world a better place?)<p>One thing I like about Google is that they research and share infrastructure technologies.  Why is there any reason to think that they would not be interested in improving DNS if it makes the Internet a better place for applications?<p>They would likely benefit if more applications are moved to the Internet but that does not make this an ""evil"" or deceptive tactic.  What other company today would improve an Internet protocol or create a new protocol (Wave) and release it openly in an effort to move the Internet forward?<p>Sure you need to be mindful of how data is used and the services you sign up for but that applies to any service, including OpenDNS.",1259877598

The real problem is when a service collects -- and never purges -- data under the guise of one privacy policy, but leaves the door open to adopting a different privacy policy which could be retroactively applied to the data already collected.  I'm no lawyer, but the OpenDNS privacy policy does appear to fall into that category: ""Your continued use of our sites and services after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.""  Right, and if I stop using the service when the policy changes, will my old data be automatically flagged so that it still falls under the old policy?",1259875198

At least open DNS servers exist like Level3 (4.2.2.[1-4]) or now Google (8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4)... (and to a lesser extent OpenDNS, which is 'open' but tries to pull some of the same advertisement stuff).<p>In general, the distributed aspect of DNS was to reduce latency and network traffic. While this might not keep network traffic within your ISP's internal network, it can severely reduce latency even if you're on a large ISP like Comcast/Qwest/TimeWarner. My only guess as to <i>why</i> this appears to be true, is that most ISPs don't really give a crap about their DNS servers just so long as it's still running and hasn't imploded.",1259875196

All they'd need to do is count any valid URL as 20 characters (length of a bit.ly shortened URL) for the purpose of the limit, while preserving the actual real URL up until that limit actually mattered.<p>The sad and ironic part is that the 140-character limit and the URL shorteners it spawned will probably stick around, due to Twitter, far longer than Twitter-via-SMS does.  I don't know many people who even use Twitter via SMS anymore; it was a cool feature initially, but it's being quickly obsoleted by smartphones that can access Twitter via much more user-friendly interfaces via TCP/IP.<p>""140 characters"" is likely to become the ""4 feet, 8-1/2 inches"" of the Internet.

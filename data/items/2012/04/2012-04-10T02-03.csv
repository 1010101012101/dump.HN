Annoyances were someone hacking the controls and setting a ship to move across the screen shooting a great number of shots directly left and right that moved in a wave straight up and down the screen, wiping out all players in its path. Trying to move ahead of this often didn't help due apparently due to lag. I managed to shoot the bugger, but then they respawned with movement reset and the whole screen was speckled with shots, yet another killing field. Later it was doing similar movements to before but shooting out in a spiral at a rate unmatchable with the space bar. Thanks for building this!<p>Edit: A hide-able chat msg system would be cool. I just wanted to hit t and say ""good fight!"" after an opponent and I managed to take out each other at the same moment.",1334026586

Just because you can't reinvest the money in that fund does not mean it is lost, it is simply paid out to investors right away.<p>Anybody who has taken a finance course knows the simple principle that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. It is NEVER better to make a return of equal percentage later in a fund than early. Instead of having $50 million to invest in the original fund in the same companies as before, you now have $100 million to invest in the same companies as before. The fallacy in your logic is that you are hung up on the required return for that single fund.<p>The only way what you are saying is valid is if by investing that $50 million in Instagram, they missed out on the opportunity to invest in another company that at some point in the future would have returned more. In a window of about two months, I highly doubt that's the case. Again, once you have doubled your money and gotten it back, you can invest it anywhere you like, including the same companies you may have before. But now you have twice as much money. There is nothing magical about that fund that makes its investments more special than another.",1334026351

		Core 4 High Level Design Goals
		Core 4 vs. Core 3 Architecture
		New features in Core 4 (triggers, SNMPv3, IPv6)
		ZenPack Repository<p>Basically, with this live demo, you'll see the new architecture, new features, and hear first-hand what direction Zenoss is heading in the coming months.",1334024327

Getting from coast to coast certainly HAS changed in the last 100 years. 100 years ago, you had railroads or mostly dirt roads. A crap ton of infrastructure has been put into it (interstates and the intensely complex logistics of maintaining them). A pile of services exists around this problem (airlines, and the even more complex logistics of keeping them running safely and profitably). Going broader, you are ignoring all types of ""get between coasts"" that apply to stuff rather than ""me"" - what is the best way to get a pile of widgets from LA to NYC? Airplane? Train? Some trucks? -- the answer is ""well that depends on $logistical_considerations"". Going narrower, choosing the right car for you is a pretty complicated process, trading off features, options, gas mileage, capacity and so on - just like any set of programing options, only internalized by the culture"".<p>Further, a car is simple to use out of the box, but customization beyond do-dads and bling? Nope, not really easier than it ever was. Different tools? sure. Different base skills? not really. Anyone can do it? Not so much.<p>And before I go into tech equivalencies here, if you think cars are pretty much the same and can be abstracted to ""the car"" for the purposes of this discussion, go buy a van or pick up truck. Watch your social graph get all buzzy and see the request pour in for help, turns out your form of tradeoff in ""car"" are very very useful to people, and suddenly a car isn't just a car.<p>Further, I would argue that we have done wonders for the tech equivalent of ""car"". We have amazing computation devices in our pocket that just do what people never knew they wanted to do in the form of ""phone"". We have awesome abilities to have web presence unthinkable (outside of internet famous blog machines) 10 years ago, in the form ""social graph"".  These are great and just work for most people, until they need something different...<p>In the infrastructure department: the ability to do semi-custom stuff has grown in ways unimaginable in the car world. Need a website to do your magic? Here are a bunch of platforms like app engine or heroku, all you need to do is get your custom stuff in place, don't worry about the machinery to feed it. Up and down the customization level there are more entry points as well. Going back to the car world, how easy is it really to get a ricer put together? How easy is it to put in crazy hydrolics or a good thumping stereo system? Need to rip off the doors, reshape the body and put in a different engine? Good luck getting a doctor to just do that without serious learning curve.<p>Basically, my point here is that hard stuff is hard. If it isn't your specific field, it is easy to just blow off the stuff that caters to the masses as ""they made it easy"", and at the same time, it is easy to blow off the stuff in your field which caters to the masses as ""not done well"".<p>Final thought: a lot of people look at cars and computers the same way, as soon as the littlest thing goes wrong, they freak. or they take it to the mechanic who asks ""why haven't you changed the oil in 7 years? (c.f. our IT guys who ask why they don't have anti-virus installed).",1334024253

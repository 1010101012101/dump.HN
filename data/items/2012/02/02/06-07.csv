The best you can do is, as PG says, don't make the stupid mistakes.<p>Speaking of examples, a lot of products have come from building things for oneself (BaseCamp for instance.) Building a product you use may not be much of a help if you're making any fundamental mistake. However, it makes the life of the developer a hell lot easier.<p>When you are designing a service you use, intuition comes to your aid. Some things just feel right and some things just wrong.

Lynx's numbered links mode is fantastic, to set it, you need to go to options>keypad mode.<p>The other browser, that makes link navigation a lot easier is Opera, use shift and arrows, to move around the links.<p>I love the above interface so much, it's so simple, and could easily be mimicked with a trackball and a touch pad such as that on the Blackberry.  The Blackberry utilises a similar method for it's nav and menus and it's very easy, quick and intuitive to use.<p>Of course you could place the directions on the home row, for touch typists too.  But I guess you can do something similar with Vimperator etc.<p>I read your blog post, and firsts thoughts were that shift and arrows could be used for OS UI navigation as well.  Tiling window managers work well for me, but I have a lot of trouble with keyboard navigation in applications, mainly due to inconsistencies.  Something as simple as moving from text pane, to toolbar, to sidebar - can require - some dexterous moves using function keys.<p>Hitting escape, and then moving around the UI with arrow keys would be much easier.  Hit escape twice to move up the application stack.  Hit the menu key - for context sensitive menu, hit escape->menu for app menu and so on.<p>Tabbed browsing for me is a real curse, as there is so much inconsistency between applications.  This should be the preserve of window managers.   So back to your blog post.  Why haven't the best parts of some of the esoteric window managers propagated through to the mainstream OSs?<p>Interestingly tabbed browsing is what won me over to Opera and Firefox in the first place - the desktop OSs should have picked up on this earlier.  It's a hack, to get around a poor desktop UI.<p>Back to Mozilla, why have they barely touched or been creative with the UI for the last decade?

3541727,comment,3541584,3541664,6,0,plinkplonk,,,"""RIP Flipkart""<p>it isn't that simple. Flipkart is aggressive, funded (150 million $ a few days ago), has superlative customer service and (generally) satisfied customers. Meanwhile the law of the land does not allow 100% Foreign Direct Investment in retail, and while that will inevitably change, it will take some time, thus giving Flipkart more competition free runway.<p>Junglee.com is just a 'dip toe in water' move, trying various things ""for free"" in a new market (and hence non use of the Amazon trademark).<p>""Amazon launches Junglee in India"" (the original Junglee.com was a comparison site) is a more accurate title than ""Amazon launches <i>as</i> Junglee in India"". The site is close to useless for anyone actually trying to shop,but it will enable debugging of parts of the logistics chain Amazon is trying to set up.<p>The 'real' war begins when Amazon.in launches. Junglee is just a sideshow (and everyone knows it)<p>Eventually,assuming they don't enter into some kind of partnership, there will be a huge fight between Flipkart and Amazon, but it is going to be long and bloody and last at least a couple of years, and will not be a quick knockout.<p>Amazon's advantages (when it finally starts full operations) - existing client base (I was told that Indian customers spend more on the Amazon website than Flipkart's turnover), the Kindle devices and ecosystem adapted to the local publishing landscape (this will, imo, be huge), better recommendation systems, better payment systems, efficiencies of scale, (better tie ups with foreign publishers and so) better deals for foreign books and products, way deeper pockets.<p>Flipkart's advantages - (relatively) nimble, speed of decision making (Amazon will likely replicate its middle management heavy organizational structure, and bureaucracy), a satisfied customer base and good will, and a  time advantage in working out the kinks in  logistics and delivery.<p>Most importantly, Flipkart is running for their life, where Amazon is running for an extra spoon of  dessert. I wouldn't underestimate this factor.<p>So if I had to bet, I'd bet on Amazon to ""win"" in the long run, but I would bet only money I am prepared to lose, and it is a very long way from ""RIP Flipkart""",1328164678

It belongs to bisphosphonate group of medicines. It is used for treatment of osteoporosis in women after menopause. It also prevents osteoporosis by affecting the bone formation and breakdown cycle. It slows down the process of bone loss and alongside increases bone mass. This alteration prevents bone fractures.<p>Roche Laboratories Inc. manufactured Boniva, which is an anti-osteoporosis drug. It is used to treat osteoporosis in women after menopause. It has been linked to several serious and fatal side effects. One of the severe side effects of Boniva is osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). It is a rare mouth disease in which there is death of the jaw bone. These side effects have led to many lawsuits filed against Roche related to Boniva side effects. Other similar drugs in the same class for treatment of osteoporosis have also being questioned regarding safety of using them.<p>Boniva was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2003. It was approved for treatment of osteoporosis in women after menopause. It is also used to treat cancer patients, whose disease has moved to the bone too. It comes in both daily and monthly dosage. Boniva is mainly ibandronate sodium and contains nitrogen. It affects the formation and breakdown cycle of bones and prevents fracture and increases bone mass. This osteoporosis drug affects bone metabolism. It affects bones by making them lose tissue less rapidly and thus there is an increase in bone density.<p>Boniva should be taken in upright position and patient should remain in the upright position for one hour or it can cause esophageal ulcers. It should be avoided in patients having kidney problems or stomach troubles. It can trigger allergic reactions in sensitive patients and is also linked with gastrointestinal disorder in some patients.<p>Lawsuits are in offing against Boniva in a large number as it has shown severe side effects like osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients using this drug. In 2003 many studies established that bisphosphonate drugs can cause osteonecrosis of the jaw. ONJ is a condition in which the bone dies in the jaw. This condition could occur after dental surgery, implants or other oral surgery. If Boniva is being used while going through these treatments, the patients do not recover and experience swelling or loose teeth. Finally jawbone dies in the mouth. This condition cannot be treated. In 2006 a study showed that around 120 patients in 2500 cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw were taking Boniva at that time. Since then more and more reports of bone deaths related to Boniva have been reported.<p>Roche was sued by Proctor & Gamble and Sanofi Aventis, rival pharmaceutical companies in 2006. They accused Roche of establishing Boniva as beneficial as other bisphosphonates drugs through aggressive advertising campaigns. They accused that Roche advertised that Boniva has similar benefits as Fosamax and Actonel. They claimed that the chemical structure of Boniva is different from these drugs. Roche defended it by alleging its rival for smearing its name. It accused that they were misrepresenting its side effects through different studies against it. It also said physicians are being threatened of malpractice cases by them if they prescribe Boniva.<p>The decision came in Roches favor. The U.S. District Court rejected the proposed injunction in September 2006. It also accused Proctor & Gamble and Sanofi Aventis of trying to smear Bonivas name to undermine its market share. It said they were trying to keep popularity of their own bisphosphonate drugs by dragging Boniva in controversies.<p>For More Information Visit: http://www.unsafedrugs.com/1481/lawsuits-against-boniva",1328164073

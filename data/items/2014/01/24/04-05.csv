I don&#x27;t understand the analogy you&#x27;re trying to make by bringing in the debian repositories into the discussion.  It seems to me like you&#x27;re saying making friends on Friendster are more legitimate than friends made on Facebook because it was an initial innovator in the social network.  Here&#x27;s a 2013 that states github has 50% more projects then the next repository (sourceforge)[1].  Here&#x27;s a 2011 that discusses when github turned 1 million accounts [2].<p>My argument is that many young developers don&#x27;t care where they get their code, what license it has, etc.  They just want to build, create, collaborate [3].  A secondary argument is that many people feel the GPL is a barrier to collaboration.<p>When it comes to gifts and beer, I would hope my friend wouldn&#x27;t hit me with it nor would I put poison in his beer.  They&#x27;re (implicitly) <i>allowed</i> to hit me with it, but I don&#x27;t expect such a thing to occur.  Nor should they expect me to put poison in it.  That&#x27;s all a matter of trust.  And the GPL, proprietary licenses, DRM are instruments of distrust.<p>In the end, you always have choice.  I choose to live by the philosophies that &quot;Givers Gain&quot; and people do want to be good people.  I understand not everyone has as altruistic intentions, heck, I work for those people.

Currently, to open a file, we take the path that you give us and call .to_c_str() on it, but that method also exists on strings.

Also if you think it would be wrong to allow one to attempt to open a file using any type that can be transformed to a C string, then you might want to think about having a tiny wrapper trait with a more semantic name, like .to_path_str(), which would be generic over .to_c_str() and simply call that method on itself.

One of the major factors that <i>would have</i> driven up tech salaries was if some of the biggest and most profitable tech companies (indeed, some of the most profitable companies in history) such as Apple, Google, etc. were openly competing to try to lure talent to their companies through financial incentives.<p>Likely, compared to other industries tech workers were nevertheless handsomely paid, but I think this is still an example of abuse of power.<p>It&#x27;s all the more worrisome because the changes in the nature of the stock market and so forth have made it that much more difficult for top tier tech workers to become rich. That used to be the pattern in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, there are thousands of millionaires who worked at apple, microsoft, etc. for only a decade but were around during those companies&#x27; crucial early growth phases. Today I think that phenomenon is much less common except with extremely early stage employees. A lot of startups are the brain children of the sort of top tier techies who made it rich working at various vast growing companies. That variety of wealth is, I believe, very important to the vitality of the industry. But for various reasons it seems to have been significantly curtailed in the last decade or so, but if there is a more competitive marketplace for salaries in the tech field then that would go a long way toward bringing it back.",1390537982

I doubt I&#x27;ll be able to change your mind, but for bystanders&#x27; benefit:<p>The reason that programmers don&#x27;t dress to impress is that their work product - the value that they add to other people - has nothing to do with their appearance.  A programmer is paid for the software she creates; the user of that software has no idea what the programmer who wrote it looks like, and they judge the quality of it by what it does.  So programmers have developed other metrics that they use to form a status hierarchy, notably the quality and difficulty of programs that you&#x27;ve written, but also things that are somewhat fuzzier like the technologies and tools you use.<p>Contrast this with a lawyer or salesman, where your buying decisions are directly influenced by how they present themselves and you often cannot directly determine the quality of their product.  People in these professions have a strong incentive to present themselves well because customers have no other information to base their purchasing decisions on.<p>Certainly in the one metric shared across all professions - money - engineers at top tech companies are not being taken advantage of by management, nor are they &quot;cheap grunts&quot;.

Of course people will adapt and simply stop using temperature related keywords in their event titles?<p>My point being: Users shouldn&#x27;t need to adapt to unexpected features. If such features exist, they are implemented badly or shouldn&#x27;t exist in the first place. That&#x27;s Interaction Design 101.",1390536215

Zidisha definitely isn&#x27;t for everyone - it is really a do-it-yourself platform rather than a managed charity.<p>We do have an autolending tool, which gives lenders the option of having their repaid funds automatically recycled into new loans.  However the vast majority of our lenders opt to choose their loans themselves, and some even develop online friendships with the borrowers - exchanging recipes and children&#x27;s photos, like old-fashioned pen pals except the communication is instantaneous.  Our platform is really optimized for getting directly involved with each individual loan.",1390536190

Nerds in childish t-shirts want to sit around pecking out code in isolation instead of taking full responsibility for their work by putting on a jacket and working the organization.

Although I have high-spec workstations both at home and the office, the Surface Pro is a terrific form factor for carrying to work and back every day as a pedestrian commuter.  It&#x27;s great to have with me in case I have to do some work away from my workstations.<p>As a thick tablet, the Pro is stunningly fast compared to other tablets.  With the keyboard, it&#x27;s up to any task I&#x27;d throw at an ultrabook.  The touchscreen is totally natural and fitting for such a small device.  It&#x27;s great to be able to just click UI buttons with your finger on the screen, even in the &quot;laptop&quot; orientation.  The battery life is more than enough for my use-case.<p>I don&#x27;t use the stylus much—I wish it had slightly better precision.<p>What achievements must I unlock to earn the hardcore techie badge?  Maybe I&#x27;m still a few shy.",1390536006

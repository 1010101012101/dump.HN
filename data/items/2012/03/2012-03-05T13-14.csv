American young people may be at a disadvantage to Asian young people in the coming years.<p>I think it would be difficult in the US to have the government provide, what is essentially angel funding, to startups. But this sort of, 'provide angel funding' thinking, is beginning to take hold around asia. For instance, I knew that the Indonesian government was trying to figure out the details of how they might accomplish something similar in Indonesia.<p>I don't know...just will be interesting to see those structural differences and how they play out over time. Maybe Asia will have more low quality startups since that funding is less dear. I don't know...it'll be interesting to watch.",1330955817

3666469,comment,3666242,3666242,10,0,yason,,,"Stress comes from change and change means you don't know what will happen. Coincidentally, you never know in life what will happen so at worst you could be stressed to max merely for being alive.<p>There are two approaches to this uninviting uncertainty. Either you try to block it out or you accept it as a fact of life. In the first case you want to build as many static and seemingly permanent corners in life as possible, using methods such as routines and risk-avoidance. In the latter case you set out to do whatever you must because you don't know if you'll live tomorrow and you have nothing to lose.<p>Most people settle with something in between. If you intend to block change, it will break through somewhere else and you suffer again and that is like patching a sinking ship. If you intend to accept change, you demand a lot from yourself and you will certainly be tried for that up to the highest standards, but you will possibly come out if not enlightened at least balanced and realistic about life.<p>Stress is good.

Are other related open source projects affected?  How bad is it?  This itself can take a bit of time.  We do not rush this because we don't want a full disclosure when it happens to bring other problems into the fore.<p>2)  Within a few days we let the reporter know what we have found and give them a chance to offer feedback.<p>3)  Then we get everyone on the core team together and talk solutions.  Once we implement it, we test and release a patch.  Two weeks after the patch is released, we release a full disclosure along with a hat tip to the one who discovered it.<p>The whole process takes time.  But the fact is that it's generally better to get a full fix out in two weeks than a partial fix out tomorrow.<p>So no, don't burn the midnight oil.

You get this issue with ASP.Net MVC as well on most of the trivially implemented projects out there.<p>This is not really a ""framework bug"" as such. It's just crap application architecture.<p>At the core of this issue is a simple misunderstanding on what the ""model"" part of MVC actually is. The model represents ONLY the request or ""form model"", not the data model. There should be a mapping of 1:1 between the request and the ""form data model"" always with no exception. The controller is responsible for translating that into something useful or doing something with it involving the domain/data model.<p>Unfortunately where the usual CRUD approach is required, ignorance reigns supreme and the shortest path, not the most correct path tends to appear.<p>I write this as someone who works on a rather large ASP.Net MVC application (100+ controllers) and has seen this many times already.",1330955283

Walked away with about 32 business cards, many were interesting, two solid leads (one turned into a sale), and a great deal of confidence that we were pushing for a great market.  Gave away 50 business cards.  This was despite the fact that we had an extremely simple booth (two banners, nothing on the walls, a desk and some marketing material).<p>But you don't just go to a convention or conference and expect to succeed.  There is little in the way of prizes for just showing up.  You have to put in legwork and you have to think through and plan your presence.<p>The first thing we recognized was that we had no real way to draw people to our booth with our main product (LedgerSMB).  Nobody was going to come by and see what we could offer.  So we decided to reinvent ourselves a bit and turn the tables a bit-- our primary exhibit was PostgreSQL (since PostgreSQL as an org wasn't going to be there and generally when PostgreSQL is going to be at a conference, we have tended to volunteer at their booth, so the arrangement wasn't unusual except that we paid for the booth) and our secondary one was LedgerSMB.  We knew it was government-centric so we planned our marketing materials to be government-centric, including a case study of the use of PostgreSQL at CNAF in the French Government.  We gave away probably 100 of those.<p>Once folks came in to talk with us about databases we'd also talk about accounting and ERP software.  While others (Hitachi) were offering a raffle for a free iPad, we got folks to come by, simply offering them something that was interesting to them, and being able to talk about it.<p>Also we blogged about our presence in advance, and gave a report after, ensuring that people would know that we were there.<p>The moral of the story is this:  with conferences what you get out depends a lot on what you put in.  Time and attention to detail goes a long way towards success.",1330953897

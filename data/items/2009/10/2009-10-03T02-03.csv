The indexing they do can be very helpful in certain implementations.",1254538751

858442,comment,858407,858407,0,0,tokenadult,,,"""The once-popular killer ape theory is crumbling under its own lack of evidence, with 'Ardi' putting the last nail in its coffin. On the other side of the equation, the one concerning our prosocial tendencies, the move has been towards increasing evidence for humans as cooperative and empathic. Some of this evidence comes from the new field of behavioral economics with studies showing that people do not always adhere to the profit principle. We care about fairness and justice and sometimes let these concerns override the desire to make as much money as possible. All over the world, people have played the 'ultimatum game,' in which one party is asked to react to the division of benefits proposed by another. Even people who have never heard of the French enlightenment and its call for égalité refuse to play along if the split seems unfair.""<p>Both the title, which I didn't think related as far back in time as it does, and the publication (the Wall Street Journal) made me guess wrong about what this submitted article is about. It's actually quite a thought-provoking read, by a scientist known for provoking thought about these issues, Frans De Waal.",1254538591

The name ""Simple"" defines the service very well.<p>There are too many limitations which makes SimpleDb almost impossible to use for complex data storage.  A few examples of annoying limitations:<p>1. SimpleDb is a Key to list value pair storage engine (e.g. Key = Name, Values = [John, George, Ringo, Paul]).  Seems good but you can only have 256 values per record.<p>2. Each value is limited to 1024 characters (512 for double byte)<p>3. Where clauses of ""select"" statements are ordered by their ascii values.  Makes things relatively complex numeric values.  Here's some suggestions from amazon when working with numerical values.<p><a href=""http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/2007-11-07/DeveloperGuide/index.html?NumericalData.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/2007-11-07/...</a><p>and floating points are especially annoying:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/691778/best-way-to-format-single-double-values-as-strings-for-simpledb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/691778/best-way-to-format...</a><p>Bottom line, my take is if you want to use SimpleDb for simple data storage, it's a wonderful service and relatively cost effective.

Managing people is an entirely different skill set, one that has little to do with understanding the technologies and more to do with handling expectations, providing a buffer layer between the team and everyone else, etc.  I'd much rather work for someone who handles those things very well but has nothing more than a high level understanding of the underlying technologies.<p>Agile can be two things.  It can be a development methodology and it can be a project management methodology.  Being good at one does not imply being good at the other.

A lot of the people I worked with were considering going to work with Omid Kordestani, who had worked under Todd Rulon Miller/Mike Homer back at Netscape - they were looking for new bodies at this young company; there was an opportunity for me to dive in.  I heard a pitch for this company, and I knew more than enough to explain to everyone that not only was the target market fully mature, but that I would be going to a company where the market was just _starting_ (Oblix - LDAP mgmt) and that there really was very little left in terms of technology development in the field of...Search.<p>So yes, I know that feeling very well.

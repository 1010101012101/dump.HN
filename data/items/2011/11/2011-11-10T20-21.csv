It'll take some time to see what resonates well with users.<p>I'm not aware of anyone else doing actual dynamic content and updates, but our product aims to make it very easy to build the dynamic email content using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and javascript.  You can just create the dynamic web page, point Movable Ink at it, and whenever someone opens the email we'll load the web page and continually render it, sending down updates to your users' email clients.",1320958754

What will they do, confiscate your phone? (assuming phone voting).  There are so many ""outs"" to the coercion scenario that it seems implausible that it would ever occur on any significant scale.  What scenario can you think of where coercion would be a real issue?",1320958754

Flash can die as a browser plugin and live on - not as a plugin, but as a programming language (AS3), whereby you code for any device using 1 language, but the compilation is to native code on various devices. This is a much lower hanging fruit than say, making a viable browser plugin for each and every browser/OS. Just an idea.",1320958737

Native functionality, storage, and background processes are important but not always necessary.<p>I work in web development with most of my clients needing simple brochure sites with a small minority wanting a web application. From my experience I think that people really underestimate the power of a web app. Even my brochureware clients ask if they need a mobile app and there are tons more who are potentially flooding app stores with unnecessary app like that. My one web app client asked about a mobile app and I said he didn't need one. It's if all you want to do is CRUD it's not worth the time, money or energy.

If used in the USA, I'm expecting to settle on Germany and Ivory Coast for the above examples, but would be surprised if residents thereof didn't object. United States is obvious, but much of the world knows it as Les tats-Unis (which was NOT recognized), and America is a very popular if unofficial/improper variant (which BTW drives some ""hey, we're in America too!""

You have to get traffic into and out of a country somehow, and for the majority of users (excepting satellite and long range wireless) that means traffic flowing through a telco/ISP. That also means physical networks with physical peering points and traffic exchange contracts, all of which fall under local laws. For many smaller countries the number of 'border checkpoints' exactly equals the number of telcos/ISPs operating there. In the case of Egypt, all it took to shutdown ~100% of traffic[1] was a phonecall to the 4 biggest ISPs. Whether that shutdown was legal in Egypt or not is a matter of local law. Until there are international conventions governing traffic exchange, the internet is not borderless.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/?r=EG&l=EVERYTHING&csd=1294957800000&ced=1297377000000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/?r=EG&l...</a>",1320958200

3221781,comment,3221641,3221641,4,0,mwexler,,,"Hmm... lots of us in the email marketing world did stuff like this years ago.  Almost every top-flight email marketing vendor can do this today.  Perhaps I'm missing what's the truly new, but customized emails linked to when/where they are opened crossed by profile variables and up-to-second content like auction prices is old hat.  Looking at the demos, it looks like they either generate an image live on the fly with whatever content you have linked in, or use GeoIP to make a map image for local relevance.<p>Over the years, we found that these features don't always mesh with the ""mental model"" folks had about email... so that sometimes, the effort to create really dynamic content like this didn't really pay off; in some cases, however, such as auctions, limited offers, and other countdown situations, it could work really well.  Some folks tried to send one mail and tell people ""hey, keep this mail, whenever you open it, it's new!"" hoping that they would go back to it during the day or even across a few days.  But it would get buried in the flood of mail.  And many people assume email is static, that what they saw this morning is what will be there that afternoon.  Having it change (deal of the hour stuff, for example) can really confuse some readers.<p>So, glad to see that what's old is new again, and I wish these guys luck.  I'd love, however, for someone to point out what's really new compared to the stuff that's been done in the past.   Because yes, the email game could use some spice, and if it does something really new, perhaps this could help improve the email experience.",1320957752

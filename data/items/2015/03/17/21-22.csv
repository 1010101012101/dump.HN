Interface is by the very definition a barrier between your brain and the system you want to change (by &quot;system&quot; I mean a system in general sense, a hammer, nail and a piece of wood also form a system). What matters is your goal and the change of system&#x27;s state - everything else is cruft and we should aim to remove it.<p>Your brain actually tries to do that by its own. You can see it when e.g. driving a car. At first you&#x27;re aware of everything - the steering wheel, the pedals, the gear shift knob, etc. You consciously manipulate them to move the car around. But at some point, with enough accumulated experience, you don&#x27;t really think about the interface anymore. You just think <i>&quot;I want to be there&quot;</i> and do all the required movements to steer the car to the right place.<p>What is important for your brain to learn to ignore the interface is the interface being <i>predictable and consistent</i>. This is where, I think, smartphones are a step backwards compared to old featured phones. As we moved from firmware to full OSes, you can&#x27;t rely anymore on <i>timing</i>. For example, on my old SE K800i I could do most frequent actions without even taking my phone from my pocket, because my brain learned the position and timing of various options. &quot;Press Right Function, move down twice, press Right Function, wait 0.7 seconds, press Right Function...&quot;, etc. It&#x27;s something that you can&#x27;t do on a smartphone, because the new tech is laggy and full of unpredictable interface delays.<p>> <i>The next step forward is probably to geofence your car and when you&#x27;re near, a push notification asks you if you&#x27;d like to open your car door.</i><p>Or we could, you know, use NFC for opening and/or BLE for determining if the phone is near/inside the car.<p>Geofencing is totally a wrong tool for the job (and so far every time I heard it being suggested for something, ot was wrong for that as well).<p>> <i>Finally, we get to the two step walk to door, open door.</i><p>We could do that decades ago.

It means you\n  can&#x27;t fix the kernel and every driver in it, and you have\n  to keep legacy interfaces around.\n</code></pre>\nSorry, but I strongly disagree and that&#x27;s a factually, anecdotally, and objectively incorrect statement.  OS X, Windows, AIX, and Solaris all manage to provide stable interfaces for drivers while still evolving the underlying implementation significantly.  So clearly, it can be done.<p>A properly designed API/ABI allows evolution of the implementation while retaining compatibility through interface.<p><pre><code>  Out of tree modules are a bug; pick hardware that\n  doesn&#x27;t need them.\n</code></pre>\nThe idea that the Linux kernel should or can contain all support for all hardware ever is an ideological pursuit at best.<p><pre><code>  And the stability issues aren&#x27;t just with keeping the\n  drivers up to date. Users who run the nVidia proprietary\n  driver regularly report crashes and stability issues.\n</code></pre>\nAnd people still report stability and crash issues with mainline kernel drivers too, just perhaps less frequently, so that&#x27;s really an orthogonal concern.  Quality of implementation is not an argument I would want to use against good architectural software practices such as having a stable API/ABI.  I&#x27;m also quite familiar with the argument that &quot;if the source is open, people can fix it and make it better!&quot; -- I think the recent OpenSSL problems have proven that just because the source is open doesn&#x27;t mean anyone is fixing problems there.<p>Regardless, the real losers here are the users; I don&#x27;t frankly care about the proprietary vs. not arguments and holding up some ideological standard as the ultimate goal seems like it&#x27;s missing the point -- computers are just tools, and we should spending more time on improving the usability of them for users not fighting ideological wars.",1426627061

Entrapment is a valid defense against criminal liability. The article tries hard to argue that this should be viewed as entrapment, and that information that might have swayed the court, such as background words of the investigators, wasn&#x27;t available during the trial.<p>Your scenario is hypothetical. If the police set up the circumstances so he was convinced that his neighbors were being robbed and kidnapped right in front of him, and a planted gun were at his feet, after being invited to a half-day presentation on the moral righteousness of Florida&#x27;s Stand-your-ground law, and he picked up the gun to protect his neighbors, who are actually police officers in disguise, then yes, the circumstances are very important in judging his guilt under the law.<p>Or, if he came across the button that would trigger a nuclear bomb to blow up NYC, he might press it. That doesn&#x27;t mean he would actually be able to get access to that button, assuming such thing exists. Nor does it mean that he should be manipulated into believing that it exists, and is in front of him, so that after making a speech about destroying all the running dog capitalists on Wall Street he presses the button, and then is arrested for the attempted murder of 9 million people.<p>Regarding being turned into the FBI; that&#x27;s a huge amount of resources spent on something where the best scenario for the FBI is that he&#x27;s put into jail, where we as taxpayers have to spend even more money. Imagine if we instead spent 10% of that money on psychiatric services for him instead. Was this really the best place to spent the money?<p>Then again, the FBI and other places get a lot of money to track down terrorists. That&#x27;s high on their mission list. I don&#x27;t think of it as something they do for &quot;kicks&quot;, but something which helps justify their jobs, or because they want to &#x27;protect the homeland&#x27;, but because there are so few terrorists, they have little experience to judge who is an actual terrorist vs. someone talking big, or the experience in how to handle these sorts of cases.",1426626821

But I have acknowledged that in terms of pure page user interface and interaction speed on a Windows PC, nothing can compete with IE.  Its use of GPU acceleration for 2D page rendering makes things like CSS transitions shockingly smooth and fast.  The CSS transitions for gradients are particularly delicious; I still have an optional subtle animation in the background of my blog using the gradient transitions.  I used to have more animation in my blog (before readers convinced me it was annoying), and IE made Firefox and Chrome look as if they were running on clunky hardware from 5 years ago.  IE is the only browser that—even when rendering typical web sites—reminds me that my workstation is a 3770K with a high-spec nVidia GPU.  In Firefox and Chrome, I can easily forget how powerful my PC is until I fire up something that kicks off some 3D.<p>I am hopeful that Spartan will continue to lead in that area of so much importance to me: perceived performance.

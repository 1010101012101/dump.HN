uniq -c is line by line
sed is line by line<p>A superior solution in every way<p>If you were going to do this in Python (or another similar language), you need to write a sort function that operates on a file, not a Python collection, as the collection is always bound by RAM, which would at best be re-implementing the sort command. Once you can sort a file, everything else is trivial, as counts can be done line by line, or more siply, via uniq -c.<p>Of course, if you only care about things that fit in memory, you can do it in Python, but it is still far easier to use command line for these type of problems.",1343519997

If Apple have a valid patent as I understand it they can license it for any price that they want OR completely refuse to license it provided they haven't made any agreements or commitments to the contrary.<p>That is the normal case with patents, exclusive rights. When you step into a standards body and offer your technology you give up those rights unless you specifically and clearly declare that you aren't doing so (in which case other options will be chosen by the standards body).<p>So there are other ways to look at it. Is it fair that Samsung pushed it's technology into a standard and then holds other implementers to ransom or asks them to give up their legal rights to enter the market?<p>As I say elsewhere I'm not picking sides on the validity of particular patents or what damages or even FRAND license fees should be but I do think it is important that FRAND commitments are given weight and enforced.<p>For me forced cross licenses and percentages of finished product price are both discriminatory and not FRAND. Even percentage of chip price I have my doubts about as it discourages integration of chips with its hardware and power advantages. This doesn't mean that it must be less than 1c or even $1 but some mechanism to be fair to all patent holders while not pricing the standard out of use needs to be found.",1343519735

The expected value of the number of fissions caused by a fission must be greater than 1, then you explode.<p>Basically, suppose you can market more. Each time you market a given amount M, you create a new convert. 2M, two new converts. 3M, three new converts.<p>As E(N) gets close to 1, these converts create their own new converts. There's a sort of multiplying factor for the final number of converts if E(N) < 1, it's 1/(1 - E(N)).<p>So if every convert ends up converting, on average, 2/3 of a new convert, then M now generates 1/(1 - 2/3) = 3 converts total. That's a multiplication of your investment in marketing by 3. So you can spend one third the marketing money! If you can boost this rate from 66.7% to 80% your marketing becomes 5x more effective. If each convert creates, on average, 0.9 converts, you're now 10x more effective with your marketing money.

Sometimes I mean ""rewind to start"" and I accidentally tap the button twice to say ""seek to last track."" That takes me to a random track and then the original is no longer available as ""next"". So irritating.<p>And this randomness-is-too-random crap does happen. I'll put on a list of songs to sing along to, only a few hundred songs, and often after half an hour or an hour I'll be repeating songs which I've already sung. Sometimes they'll be two-in-a-row or separated by only one, two, or three different songs.<p>(The other great thing about Rockbox was that I had access to <i>folders</i> which automatically acted like playlists. We've had debates about this back and forth around HN, I know, but suffice it to say that it's really nice to have an ""Audiobooks"" folder where you can download individual book folders. Otherwise you often have to make sure that you don't get bizarre interleaved numberings, chapter 01 from book X followed by chapter 01 from book Y. In Samsung, this is actually governed by the Title of the ID3 tag of the MP3, which can be even <i>worse</i>.",1343516834

Much harder than learning the technical skills to actually become great, and I think I know more programmers that're held back by inability to work on teams than by lack of programming skill.<p>Largely, it's about taking a leap of faith and trusting that you can still do great things even when they're not solely <i>your</i> great things.  Who are you more likely to have heard of, Paul Buchheit (one of many who worked on GMail) or Fredrik Lundh (sole developer of PIL)?  Tim Berners-Lee (one of many who developed the web) or Daniel Veillard (almost sole developer of libxml)?<p>It can also help to just think of it as an experiment - ""Okay, I am reasonably financially secure for now, what happens if I stop caring so much about glory and start looking at the world around me?  Will I become a complete slacker and end up doing nothing, or will I end up becoming even more successful?""  And then just try it - you have relatively little to lose, after all - and see what the results are.  It's also quite possible that for some people, giving up their ambition really does leave them with nothing and they sit around and play video games all day, and those people should probably stick with their hunt for glory.  For me, though, I found that when I cared less about how successful <i>I</i> could be, I started becoming curious about what else was going on around me, and that gave me more information for better decisions, and that made me more successful anyway.",1343516677

Little success every day, not matter what it is, will get you out of the rut.<p>I am reading 2% of War and Peace every day. Made it to 75% by now, and every day that I read the book I have something to look back to. Contemplative reading has second order effects as well - I feel I can concentrate better, which is very helpful given that the internet has taught our minds to jump all over the place like a monkey. I set aside an hour in the evening and do nothing but read.<p>Try it. If nothing else you will have read a great book.

But I don't yet speak German, so after an hour I wanted to watch them in English.<p>I went to the NBC web site, but they geolocate your IP and only stream to US people.  Fine, I'm used to this crap (lots of Youtube videos are blocked in Germany too) so I just fired up my proxy and tried again.  This time I got through, only to find that they're asking me to log in to a cable provider first!  What the hell!<p>After scouring the internet I found a huge list of Olympics streaming broadcasters.  Turns out the BBC is broadcasting online too.  So I try them--same thing, blocked outside of the UK!  But this time I don't have a proxy in the UK, so I gave up and watched the damn thing in German.<p>I get the theory of having to go through a cable provider login to get the US Olympics.  But what if you're a taxpaying UK citizen abroad for a while?  You've paid your tax--but you still can't access the stream!<p>Wasn't the internet supposed to break through barriers like space and location?  In the year 2012 am I seriously being denied an English-language broadcast of a global event just because my laptop is currently in Germany?<p>Sure I can jump through even more hoops and figure out a UK-based VPN or some crap.  But the point is I shouldn't have to do this!  We're in 2012 people!  Why even have the internet if we're just going to lock up information according to where you live?",1343516514

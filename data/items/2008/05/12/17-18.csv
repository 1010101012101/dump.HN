But I am assuming that among Microsoft/Google/Apple, 3rd parties will use their SDKs Android's open source to create business applications and integrations that will make the Blackberry look lame and expensive in two years, so much so that PalmOS and RIM's OS and SDKs will look lame not just to developers, but users as well.<p>There are currently many problems right now.  Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync is free per device, but flaky.  As well, IT has to install iTunes on user machines to allow business users to activate and sync the devices.  Finally, Apple does not allow IT to disable iPod functionality on their business iPhones.  I am betting that these huge problems will be addressed before two years from now.  My point is that there will be a noticeable dent in Blackberry use (as long as good keyboards accommodate the phones running these new OS); I'm sure RIM will still have a good stock price and profits two years from now.",1210612675

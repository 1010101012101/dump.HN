7895655,comment,7895189,7895189,1,0,wwwwwwwwww,,,"fun semi-related EE design fact that readers may find interesting:<p>one of the fastest ways to tell that someone didn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing when they designed a board is that they placed the oscillator anywhere other than right next to the component it drives. the traces that connect the oscillator to the component are basically an antenna - the longer they are, the stronger they broadcast. This becomes an issue when  there are multiple oscillators in close proximity - their broadcasts can interfere with each other and cause them to synchronize. I forget what this effect is called but here&#x27;s a neat video that kinda illustrates it:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqFc4wriBvE&feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqFc4wriBvE&feature=kp</a>",1402851585

It is advantageous to have everyone use the same language for communication, but that&#x27;s not true for construction.  Different construction jobs require different tools.

7895638,comment,7894816,7894816,0,0,QuantumChaos,,,"Where is the evidence that depression is qualitatively different from being unhappy, or feeling downtrodden and apathetic?  All I ever read on the topic is (1) scientific studies that associate certain diagnoses, with the effectiveness of certain treatments, and (2) the claim by people with these conditions, that they <i>are</i> qualitatively different.<p>Is there any evidence against the following hypothesis:<p>What we call mental illnesses are (with possible exception of Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder), not qualitatively different from ordinary experience.  But in order to provide treatment (e.g. various kinds of therapy) it is useful to assign labels to people.  But this usefulness doesn&#x27;t make mental illness as &quot;real as cancer&quot;, in the sense that it is a discrete category that we can definitively assign people too.<p>One reason people prefer a diagnosis is that they prefer a label (even if it does come with some social stigma) to the greater social stigma associated with the same symptoms absent a &quot;mental illness&quot;.  Assigning such a label allows people (both the individual with the mental illness, and people around them) to view their symptoms in a different and more compassionate light.  Most importantly, it allows people to think rationally about the best course of action for the person.<p>My claim is that if society could be more compassionate, without needing to first assign a label in order to remove &quot;blame&quot; for people&#x27;s symptoms, we wouldn&#x27;t need the category of mental illness as much.  E.g. instead of saying &quot;I thought I was just a loser, but then I found out I suffered from depression&quot;, a person might say &quot;I thought I was a loser, but then I realized that what society calls a loser is a person with certain characteristics, thought patterns, and patterns of behavior, and I decided that instead of judging myself for having these things, I would find the best approach to changing them&quot;.<p>There is one more corollary to this, which is that &quot;professional&quot; help, in the form of drugs or therapy, may not be the only or best approach for such people.",1402851277

So it&#x27;s the most accurate platform actually. This singuler MinIon read however was barely mappable to the reference, so it looks pretty poor quality.

Conditions such as hypothyroidism are often similarly underdiagnosed. So if you&#x27;re feeling extraordinarily tired all the time, and anemia and other nutritional and medical causes have been ruled out, get your thyroid levels checked and a sleep study done too, or at least bring it up with your doctor.<p>But also don&#x27;t hesitate to seek out treatment for mental health problems even if a known medical cause can&#x27;t be found or has yet to be identified. It&#x27;s all physiological causes really, but there&#x27;s a lot we still don&#x27;t know about the human brain and body, and treating symptoms, especially if they are having a significant negative impact on your quality of life, is just as important as trying to find a cause.<p>And last but not least since we are talking about depression and depression-related conditions (such as bipolar, etc.), I just wanted to raise a little awareness for borderline (BPD) too. For those of you that have strong emotions, maybe a little impulsive, and/or a troubled childhood and suicidal tendencies, or have people in your life like that, you should find it really worthwhile to read up a bit on BPD:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder</a><p>It&#x27;s a diagnosis which has gotten a bad but undeserved stigma over the years, that needs better awareness and understanding.<p>Whether you identify strongly with a BPD profile or not, if you struggle with strong emotions and/or suicidal tendencies in your life, a lot of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) coping strategies and methods might be particularly helpful to you in dealing with those feelings:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavioral_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavioral_therapy</a><p>Stay healthy and happy hackers, but don&#x27;t be afraid to ask friends, family, and professionals for help when you need it either!",1402850400

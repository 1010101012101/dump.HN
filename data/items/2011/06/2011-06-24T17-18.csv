Although it's never right for a company or investor to exercise this buy back when it comes to an honest, hard-working employee, the onus really falls on the employee ensuring that this clause never sees the light of day in their contract in the first place.  Perhaps in the event of ""cause"", one could make a case, but certainly under no other condition.<p>EDIT:  It's an unethical clause to begin with - absolutely agree with the comments.

The site will get very little traffic and will generate very little buys; a dozen sales a day would be good.  The only way people will hit the site is if they belong to our niche industry and know the products/services we provide and come either to check our prices or to add libraries to their existing subscriptions.<p>The problem:<p>It is very important for us to differentiate between existing and new subscribers (due to pricing, the need to explain why they should pay a premium for online access, fear of duplicate subscriptions, etc.).  The easiest thing to do would be to ask a question before users can even access our product that would ID them as either an existing or new Sub.  Coming from a startup/Web 2.0 culture, every bone in my body screams against forcing users to go through 1 or 2 extra pages (or God forbid, log-in!) before they browse our product offering.<p>Am I looking at this the wrong way?  Is it OK to force users through a few extra steps in our very specific situation?  Or should I try a different work around (ID their status at checkout, etc)?<p>Thanks!

Also of their continued resistance in some cases to full recording/recordkeeping of interviews.  And of ingrained institutional attitudes of opaqueness with respect to their own activities, even when such activities themselves apparently or clearly violate the law.  E.g. the recent ""blue wall"" regarding the apparently unwarranted beating of protesters in Toronto.<p>I'll add that my concern doesn't just focus on the lower echelons of law enforcement.  Why have we had so few real investigations, let alone prosecutions, of suspect behavior at higher levels of government and finance?<p>I don't know the details of what LS obtained or released from Arizona.  But I wouldn't be surprised if the information includes a number of policies and actions that raise the ire of a significant portion of the public.<p>So, I'd say to law enforcement, if you are so gung ho (as it were) about ""people who have nothing to hide, shouldn't worry"", then you should start off by practicing it, yourselves.  Otherwise, you can say whatever you want:  What I observe is (yet another) hypocrite.<p>I try to remain mindful, though, that these institutions (in the U.S., and Canada in the case of my Toronto example) are managed by people whom we, the public, have elected.  And they operate within the bounds and requirements of that election process and feedback.  So... to those who focus solely on law enforcement as a problem, I'll comment that ultimately, the buck stops with the public.<p>Which can be discouraging.  The public, in aggregate, seems to keep clamoring for more of the same.<p>P.S.  By way of disclaimer, I'm not devoid of hypocrisy, myself.  Including in commenting on a situation in which I am not directly, immediately involved other than as a member of the public.<p>I would prefer that police are able to principally identify as members of the community, rather than members of a fraternity.

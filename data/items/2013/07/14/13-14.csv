Trust is based on assumptions, especially and <i>exclusively</i> when it&#x27;s a closed source software. Assumptions that what the company says is true. Now we know that they can be forced to lie and  any <i>claims</i> of the security just crumble as a house of cards.<p>Even if LastPass would&#x27;ve been an open-source, it made a little difference as the company could&#x27;ve been forced to distribute binaries made from altered sources. It wasn&#x27;t easy to build trust before, but it&#x27;s going to be nearly impossible to build it now.

I do not believe we can be compelled to store or siphon off user data to the NSA or anyone else. All the existing US laws are about turning over existing business records and not about compelling you change your business practices. In our case such an order would further force us to lie to consumers, which would put us in trouble with the FTC and irreparably hurt our business.<p>We have not received any request like this, and do not expect to. We have spoken with many lawyers particularly skilled and experienced in this part of US and international law. If we were to receive such a request we believe as do these others it would be highly unconstitutional on many independent grounds, and there is plenty of legal precedent there. With CALEA in particular, search engines are exempt.<p>There are many additional legal and technical inaccuracies in this article and I will not address all of them in this comment.

The one thing it is really poor at is capturing heart rate information and other metrics during periods of heavy activity. If you are working out or performing an intense activity, the device frequently dismisses the activity as noise for one and stops capturing the data. e.g. when my heart&#x27;s pounding after a heavy lift or a sprint and is ready to pop out, the Basis band either stops recording or shows my heart rate that&#x27;s no where close to true. I&#x27;ve exchanged emails with them in the past about their algorithms dismissing such activity as noise but they&#x27;ve maintained that they cannot discuss the algorithms they use to calculate the metrics and it&#x27;s not a device to be used for such purposes; it&#x27;s more about giving you a rough estimate as you carry on your day to day life.<p>As far as sudden heart rate increases during the night, you could possibly co-relate it to your dreaming; I woke up sweaty once after having a nightmare and my skin temperature & heart rate #s were definitely skewed by a good margin as compared to a normal night of sleep.",1373809954

For actual porn sites, the &quot;vast amount of fraudulent transactions&quot; are actually friendly fraud.  Husbands getting caught and denying they did anything, or claiming to not have approved a charge.  While up-sales and cross sales are contributor to this, this actually leads to much less fraud then you&#x27;d anticipate.  It&#x27;s usually the 3-day free trial that gets people (and rather than contacting support, who&#x27;d promptly refund the money), they just claim their credit card was stolen.<p>The truth is, when you compare the majority of the porn industry with the majority of the gaming, movie, and music industries (all entertainment industries), porn companies treat their customers far better than the others.<p>Disclaimer: I worked in adult industry doing credit card processing for about 10 years.",1373809874

6040803,comment,6039659,6039659,1,0,Gravityloss,,,"You have to take into account two things:<p>1. the porosity, meaning air fills the cavities. Can you really talk about open structures and say they&#x27;re really light? Make an aluminum balloon filled with air and it&#x27;s probably lighter than air as well.<p>2. the buoyancy, meaning that the fibers displace air. If a light material is weighed in air, the result does not give the mass of the object.<p>With normal solids, this does not matter since they are heavy compared to air.<p>For example, you can weigh wood with a volume of 1 liter in normal air pressure, and get a mass result of 0.500 kg. Then weigh it in a vacuum, you should get a 1 gram difference (air density is about 1 gram per liter) - a weight of 0.499 kg.\nIn practice this is in the noise for normal materials.<p>Cloced cell extruded foam is about 30 kg per cubic meter. So here the air mass 1 kg per cubic meter already has a 3% effect. I don&#x27;t know if the weights are usually quoted with buoyancy or not. But this is closed cell, I don&#x27;t know how well it stands up to a vacuum.<p>One example of structures that can have a lot of mass but little weight is inflated ones. There have been some human powered aircraft that are really big but light on the scale. Yet they take a lot of time and energy to accelerate since all the air mass inside must be brought up to speed.",1373807835

I can type quickly, cannot click a mouse 1000 times quickly to do the same thing.  Given that I find it uninteresting so I&#x27;m not a sympathetic reviewer, I have played with padre enough to see it works and has quite a few features and is free.  I&#x27;ve seen it improve over the years.  I&#x27;m not sure what specific barriers are reduced by an IDE like padre, as most of the features seem only of benefit to truly immense non-modularized projects which culturally don&#x27;t &quot;fit&quot; well in Perl.  If it can&#x27;t all fit in your head at once, abstract something out into a separate package complete with unit tests and shrink it until it does fit.  And a large full screen editor with no IDE in the way makes it easier to fit in your mind rather than a small postage stamp view of the code.  That all said, I liked seeing the integration in padre with perlcritic and perltidy, just not enough to switch away from vi.  I need my screen real estate and keyboard more than I need automated perltidy/perlcritic and mouse shortcuts which have an impedance bump with vi anyway.<p>Perhaps the best &quot;ide&quot; for a newcomer would be multiple machines/monitors with one very large editor for code, one web browser to google for questions/examples/ideas/docs and one large window for interaction either in the debugger or testing your code.  So three monitors minimum connected to 1 to 3 computers?  I feel cramped when doing &quot;stuff&quot; with less than three.

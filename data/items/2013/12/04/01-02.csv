Keep in mind, since the benefit of currency stability is to protect both buyers/borrowers and sellers/lenders, a rise is as damaging to stability as a fall (just impacting a different segment of the transaction).<p>While there are a few examples of fiat currency experiencing hyperinflation, it&#x27;s almost always been the result of extreme political uncertainty. In a normally functioning political environment, the change in currency value may still be significant, but tends to be fairly stable (even if it changes, it changes within a predictable range).<p>That&#x27;s clearly not the case with bitcoin.",1386121947

Sure they mean something to you now, but for me you might as well say the secret to writing is writing.  The advice to draft then edit till it&#x27;s good, leaves out how hard you try on the first draft.  It makes it sound like editing and drafting are different things when they aren&#x27;t so different.  Do you punctuate on the first draft?  In American Pastoral the whole story happens parenthetically between dashes, how would you think to do that on a second pass?  I&#x27;m worried the first draft has a way of keeping the subsequent drafts down--like writing about socks; on the third draft you still have socks.<p>Seems to me you are taking time to think, but you could just as easily (to my way of thinking obviously) call it all one draft spread out over a few days.",1386120156

Brilliant stuff.<p>Lafferty&#x27;s critically acclaimed, and has a small, devoted following of readers, but somehow most scifi readers haven&#x27;t heard of him, much less read him.  Perhaps his work is just too strange for mainstream readers, who can only appreciate traditional scifi.<p>I&#x27;ve tried reading Stapledon (Last and First Men, and Star Maker), and I wanted to like him, I really did.  His ideas and sheer breadth of vision (billions of years of history, spanning galaxies) sounded amazing.  But when I got down to actually reading him, he sounded so dated, so tedious, so bombastic, so clumsy -- he&#x27;s just a poor writer.  His ideas might be worthwhile, but they&#x27;re just not expressed well.  Given how highly he&#x27;s regarded, however, I intend to give his work one more chance someday.",1414756728

They are not. Twitter is slowly replacing my RSS and news reader. Twitter is not a community thing, it&#x27;s about broadcasting (in real-time, if you need it, most people don&#x27;t, they are just addicted). I don&#x27;t tweet and I&#x27;m just following 11 people. I don&#x27;t follow friends, I just follow who has something to broadcast. Twitter is great for that.<p>Facebook is more noisy by concept. Their focus in communities and friends makes broadcasting side noisy. I had to turn off almost all my friends wall notifications, I don&#x27;t have the time or will to read that one friend that I meet once a year went to the restaurant or played a game. It&#x27;s just too much noise. That&#x27;s why FB for me is nowadays mostly a chat/email friends app. FB is great for that once most people are there.

And of course, I wouldn&#x27;t rule out outright criminal behaviour.  I recall being told about a board meeting where they discussed triggering an &quot;accident&quot; to get rid of polluting chemicals, because it was cheaper than abiding to the countries safety laws. Totally illegal, very expensive if they get caught (both for the company and the board submerse themselves), but still within the bounds of a cynical cost/benefit analysis.<p>Cartels are a difficult thing to break.  The light bulb cartel for instance still exist, even though it has officially been dissolved: light bulbs still only last a couple thousand hours, despite the existence of designs that can last 10 times longer.  (Heck, that&#x27;s one of the few things the centrally planned economy of the USSR got right: long lived light bulbs.)<p>Strength lies in numbers.  Fascists knew that, popular movement know that, and cartels know that.  Betraying the cartel is to fin yourself alone.  The financial incentive may not overcome the need to be part of the same team.  And sometimes, as is the case in the light bulb industry, it is not clear that you could actually take away the cartel&#x27;s customers: light bulbs are fairly cheap, at face value.  It&#x27;s the planned obsolescence that&#x27;s the real cost, and that cost is not disclosed to the customer.<p>You can only make your purchase decisions based on what you know.  If the cartel is based on deceit, rather than on price regulation, it can be difficult to convince people based on durability concerns.  People don&#x27;t care about sustainability, because of hyperbolic discounting.  (Why do you think we&#x27;re trashing on the planet with little regard for future generations?  It&#x27;s not because of our rulers.  It&#x27;s because we just don&#x27;t care about the future as much as we should.)",1414755780

As a introduction about me, I wanted to earn a living from my projects since 17 (there are more than 10 years since then). I started working on personal projects, and unfortunately, i got the virus. The little successes has got an amazing satisfaction to me, that couldn&#x27;t be replicated in any job i worked. And no antidote found by now :)<p>For the last 2 years, it got worse and worse. I quit once my job, got a new one into a bigger company, stayed 3 months, offered the chance to work into a startup(moderate engineering, moderate decisions), and after 7 months, i am struggling again with giving up. What still keeps me in here are my personal projects. I invest some money in few of my projects, because i somehow try to buy my ticket to quit the full time job and go into the entrepreneurship world by myself. Or at least, i want to buy a year of my work life, working for me, as a try-learn-experience.<p>All successful entrepreneurs teach us not to give up the full time job until we have a plan, savings, and our business already make some money working part time. I hardly follow this advice, but this is the way i&#x27;m trying to follow with my projects. Thanks to them, i didn&#x27;t quit. The last 2 weeks were so unproductive for me at job, my mind is only at my projects, investments, and planning my escape to work for myself.

I wonder what the conversation would be like if the truth was known about it...<p>Epigenetics is the science of how our genes express themselves. They can be altered by many factors. Environmental, even certain strains of bacteria.<p>So being gay is actually not the intent of genetics, but an error in the expression on the sexual orientation gene. This will become very public and irrifutable in the next decade.<p>There will literally be a pill that will turn a gay person straight. Where will the debate lead then? It doesn&#x27;t really matter. Within two generations, there will no longer be gay individuals (from erring epigenetics) in first world countries.<p>There is a second means of being gay. Neurol pathways are formed which redirect certain thoughts and impulses in a different way. These are strictly experience based anomalies, usually caused by trama or desperation/rationalization. These comprise only a very minor number of the homosexual population.<p>Does this change your opinion on anything?",1414753313

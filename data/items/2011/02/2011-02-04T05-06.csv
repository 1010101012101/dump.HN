I have to be brief with the first class, the main point is that it serves a function, it's not just noise. When we build a class that we use from another class (third or fourth lesson) we use a class method initially, then a non-static method, and get a chance to see the differences in action. This sets us up for static fields in the following class.<p>Then we talk about how static members relate to classes vs. instantiated objects. Often someone's already encountered the reference from static context problem, so that comes up as an example in the discussion.<p>Later we go back and look at Hello, World with ""new eyes.""<p>At these students' ages a lot of the learning needs to be experience rather than theory.",1296798451

Ultimately, what worked best was a combination of a whiteboard and paper.<p>1) Gather a few team members in a meeting room<p>2) Give each person their own color marker<p>3) Go nuts on the whiteboard, draw whatever comes to mind.<p>4) Make lots of revisions. This is the best part: It's a whiteboard! Erase with your finger. Get over it, get dirty, mix colors, make a mess. Who cares?<p>5) When you're ready, let your best ""artist"" redraw it on the whiteboard nice and big so everyone can make even more revisions.<p>6) On paper or a laptop or whatever, take notes of any edge cases or things you simply didn't think of earlier.<p>7) Repeat 3 to 6 until you're happy.<p>8) Transcribe to paper. This is vital! Do not just take a photo. You need to have every single screen on it's own piece of paper, so you can thumb through them later.<p>9) Write the name of the screen on the top edge of the back of the page.

2178503,comment,2178428,2178475,0,0,phillco,,,"That's why I really like Chrome: it's all but impossible to use an old version without going way out of your way. If I give somebody Chrome, I know they're always going to have the very latest, standards-compliant version. As a web developer, you really only have to test the latest version of Chrome; there's no ""Chrome 6"", ""Chrome 7"", ""Chrome 8"" test lineup. Huge convenience to both parties.<p>Firefox is almost as good, but you have to upgrade between major versions yourself. The fact that extensions can break between versions really drags down the whole process, but there's nothing the Firefox developers can do about that. (they're at the mercy of the extension developers.) Pretty sure that's why Chrome's extensions are dumber, more lightweight -- Google didn't want a similar struggle.<p>IE is just terrible. Microsoft made upgrading such a milestone (long installation process, new GUI to adapt to, new intro wizards to complete), that it's totally natural that people cling to older versions. ""The last time I upgraded Internet Explorer, everything changed and I didn't like it! I don't want the new one."" And that's why you have to test IE9, IE8, <i>and</i> IE7. The fact that IE9 doesn't work on XP isn't going to help.<p>Unfortunately, I see the iPad as closer to the Microsoft camp (lots of discrete versions that have to be tested individually) than the Chrome camp.",1296797874

It could be worse, but it's bad enough. They were decent once, when we didn't need them to the extent that people are using them today.<p>As others have mentioned, the signs of this problem is when people are writing language X to language Y converters to accomplish the same job, because language Y is detestable. This would be your HTML, CSS and JS. Tools like HAML, SASS and CoffeeScript are a very good sign of this.<p>For myself, there are two things that are really pissing me off: 1) Lack of security by default, 2) Lack of choice in client-side scripting. I am at the whim of JavaScript which is pretty terrible. Of course, there is no hope of anyone producing a browser that offers an API, and a set of languages that can access that API. So it's just JS. That's <i>fucked</i> to me. I have more gripes but I'd like to keep this post short.<p>On the server side, it's easier. We have more choices, because our clients are not tied into a specific server technology; I used to write PHP, but since then I moved on to something that's a lot more thought out for serving webpages. MVC is the ideal for this kind of thing. The server will give the browser what it wants, and this does not concern the customer. On the browser end? We are screwed. There is quite likely nowhere to go.<p>Unfortunately, we have four big companies (Google, Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera) pouring in a lot of money to keep this technology afloat. And it's very sad. These companies should be leading the way, not holding back technology.<p><i>Very</i> sad.",1296797835

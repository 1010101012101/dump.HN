4793635,comment,4793129,4793414,0,0,feral,,,">Given that Bitcoin records all transactions for posterity, and given the ongoing rise of ""big data"" analytics, I'd say Bitcoin is likely to be harder, in the long run, to use for shenanigans. A government currency has forms in which transactions create no paper trail. Bitcoin does not.<p>I did some research on anonymity (mentioned in that document); I find it hard to project how private Bitcoin will be in future.<p>Our impression was that currently many users were careless, and that many identities (in the form of publicly disclosed Bitcoin address ownerships) were linked to meaningful transactions; such that with basic network analysis it was possible to passively observe semantically meaningful transactions, like ""the person who owns this twitter account, which seems to be a real person, donated to wikileaks"" or ""this account which is a public organisation donation address is linked to an address that transferred bitcoins to that other organisation"".<p>We speculated that <i>if</i> Bitcoin became widely used, without changes in usage patterns, then a large e-commerce site (someone like Amazon accepting payments in Bitcoin - leaving questions of scalability aside) could passively observe much of what was going on on the network, because they had so many known identity-address pairs to start with (e.g. shipping addresses).<p>But the other argument is that its probably relatively easy for usage patterns to change.<p>I think you have to assume that end-users will always be careless. We see this in almost every security setting. So it doesn't matter whether its possible for sophisticated users to guard their privacy, if you don't get privacy by default.<p>But people could build overlay systems which are backed onto Bitcoin. A lot of the wallet services are like this already, and are not readily amenable to the blockchain level analysis (although of course you then you are trusting your wallet service with your privacy and money).\nAlternatively core or client developers could add protocol-level or low-level Bitcoin mixing (again, with an overhead cost, so there might be scalability concerns), or develop client interfaces which encourage more privacy by default.<p>Its too early to tell how observable/analyzable it'll be in steady state, if it builds traction.  I think its possible the system will end up much more observable, for casual users, than cash or even credit cards currently are, but I don't think that's inevitable.",1353070181

4793613,comment,4771999,4773151,1,0,tripzilch,,,"Did you read that reference all the way through? It's not at all convincing, IMHO. In nearly all of his experiments you need a gain factor of at least 5-10x before the high frequency range starts to damage the tweeter. He starts with analysing artificial waveforms, and the effect actually lessens as he tries it on more real-world examples. My conclusion: don't play HIA's <i>UFO Detection System</i> too loud? Which no sane person would do, anyway.<p>That aside, I've always perceived some type of limiter-effect whenever I turn up VLC over 100%. Which is not clipping. I never really considered whether this limiting happened in VLC, the OS or my soundcard. It's a small laptop so no fancy soundcards either.<p>So, checking VLC's preferences, under Advanced>Audio there's an option called ""peak protection"", which is on by default. Sounds like something that does a type of limiting?<p>But I may be wrong, I just checked, (apparently my VLC only seems to go up to 200% by default?), but with a sufficiently loud sample, I could definitely hear clipping, instead of limiting.<p>But, just like your reference says, at the moment you've applied 5x clipping that's pretty extreme. You might as well have a 1-bit waveform at that point because it'll be either up or down. It won't sound like the original any more, at all. If you play that to your expensive speakers at high power, and think it's a good idea to do that for a while, then I really don't think it's VLC's job to protect you from yourself. The only possible excuse might be someone that has a long playlist of quiet sounds, amped up to 400%, leaves and isn't there to correct it when a forgotten loud track starts up. But that scenario is somewhat far-fetched, somewhat stupid and at 400%+clipping still not certain to damage the tweeters much more than loud sounds might do in general, clipped or not.",1353069581

And so I was receiving lots of SMS messages and phone calls with threats, because that's all they could do - but it was annoying to me to have my phone ring several times per day. Then my phone number ended up on some kind of marketing list and I started receiving daily messages with special offers.<p>So I had a problem and an iPhone 3GS (received as a gift) and being a <i>smart</i>phone I expected from it to solve it, because otherwise my phone number was becoming unusable and I didn't want to change it (hey, I've got a nice, memorable number). I wanted to completely block SMS messages and phone calls for certain numbers. And I'm not referring just to make my phone silent when receiving stuff from certain phone numbers - but also a cleanup of the logs. And after all, my <i>smart</i>phone is primarily a phone, where a phone is a device used for communications - I don't care how smart it is, if it's not smart about the most basic functionality it should provide.<p>Imagine my surprise when I found out that Apple was actively blocking such apps from its App Store. So I jail-broke it and installed something from the Cydia store, which was a painful process. Then Apple released a major update to iOS that I wanted, so I updated the device, but my previous method for jail-breaking it wasn't working anymore.<p>THE ONLY REASON people put up with this is because they don't know a smartphone could solve this for them, otherwise spamming through phone calls and SMS messages is a really common problem.<p>Out of frustration I went out of my way and got a Galaxy S device. There were several apps on Android Marketplace (now Google Play) that dealt with blocking SMS and phone calls. Several were not working on my device, because the APIs for doing that are not public and so dealing with it is hard. But I found one that worked extremely well. Even in the case of Android's Marketplace also blocking such apps, it's extremely easy on Android to install apps from third-party sources, not mentioning the ease with which you can develop for it, without setup fees or bogus certificates.<p>And I've been blocking unwanted SMS messages and phone calls ever since.<p>Now, some day Apple will finally wake up and provide this functionality. I'm sure that it will be polished and better than all the alternatives. However, it will be several years too late for me. And if a <i>smart</i>phone can't provide such basic functionality that should be a no-brainer in this age of spam, then for me it's just a shiny and expensive piece of crap. And remember when they blocked Google Voice from their store because ""<i>it duplicated existing functionality?</i>"".<p>I also own an iPad. It was a gift (for some reason people like giving me Apple products, thinking that I love them). I also have a 3G plan for it, that I got separately, so this device is not subsidized or bought from my mobile carrier. Imagine my surprise when I found out that I couldn't do tethering with my otherwise expensive 3G plan and expensive device, yet my 1 year and a half Android could - and an iPad could do better tethering because of its bigger battery. And get this ... the functionality is available, but it depends on the settings the mobile carrier are wiring to your device. So they are basically controlling your device, deciding for you what you can and cannot do.<p>So now I'm dreaming of a Nexus tablet as my next device, because while the iPad is useful for browsing and stuff, I don't really ""own"" it and there's so much more it could do.<p>And I have no doubt about it, the sky is going to fall, because the writing is on the wall. Considering our increased dependency on smart technology, if you don't ""<i>own</i>"" your devices (or your data, or the software you depend on), the service providers are owning you.<p>You may not notice it right now, but remember that old anecdote about how you should boil a frog alive - slowly, otherwise it jumps out.<p>And the blame will fall partly on us, the developers that supported these closed platforms. Because we helped them grow.<p>People also like to point out how Android is more popular because it gets promoted more by carriers - isn't it funny how openness is good for everybody, including carriers and phone makers?",1353069377

It's very easy to hire someone to turn your PSD's into HTML / CSS and then the back-end devs can take it from there.</i><p>In an ideal world, yes. Unfortunately, you can often end up with HTML templates and CSS stylesheets that might fit the bill visually but simply aren't fit for purpose in other ways. As developers we need to consider factors such as the behaviour of the page and maintainability of the system as a whole. A badly designed stylesheet may be brittle and resistant to change or may even do things in a way that is incompatible with the frameworks and tools that you are using, and many designers aren't even aware that such constraints exist, let alone what problems they may cause.<p>For example, I was once given a CSS stylesheet to work with (for which the client had paid quite a large sum of money) that declared <span> as a block-level element. This caused no end of chaos when we had to use it along with ASP.NET validator controls on a WebForms page, which of course makes liberal use of <span> tags for inline validation messages.",1353069177

You don't know how low-level you have to go: if there's only a single crucial quantum interaction, you have to model that level as well, increasing the complexity many orders of magnitude (if you have to model quantums or atoms, the simulation wouldn't even fit on earth I'm afraid). Similarly for the higher levels: it's obvious that brain development depends crucially on a stimulating environment (and meaningful interaction with it), so are you going to simulate a complete environment and upbringing? Reminds me of the Sagan quote ""if you want to make apple pie, you first have to invent the universe.""<p>In a similar vein, we have succeeded in copying (digitizing) the full human genome. But, to actually do something with that requires an even greater tasks of understanding what all those genes in it actually mean (what the proteins they express do).

It's not. It's more like an <i>applied</i> research environment where people are free agents to some degree, but still are expected to follow-- to contribute to something sanctioned-- if they aren't ready to lead yet. Open allocation companies still fire people, but it's very rare, because ""intrinsic low performers"" (as opposed to people who lose motivation due to dysfunctional environments) also turn out to be very rare.<p>Open allocation doesn't mean, ""You show up and do whatever you want."" It means, ""We expect you to contribute to the business but it's your right to choose how you do so.""<p>My problem with traditional management is that old-style managers aren't really the leaders that the workers themselves would select, but puppet leaders, chosen from above. Also, when companies give managers the right to unilaterally fire people, or to damage their transfer packets through a globally-visible performance review system, they allow managers to turn into extortionists who force people into subordinating to the manager's career goals rather than doing what's best for the employee or the company. Since middle managers also get a lot of pressure from above in these sorts of companies, that's usually exactly what they become, not because they want to be extortionists but because their feet are to the fire as well.<p>I think that ""management"" as a cultural institution is archaic. Leadership, communication, and mentorship skills will <i>always</i> be in high demand, but that's not what a manager is. A <i>manager</i>, from the term's roots, is someone hired by an owner of recourses (capital) to maximally exploit them. People often get angry with their bosses when the manager ignores their career goals, but they shouldn't, because that manager is just doing his job. He works for the company, not the employee.<p>Managed environments lead to localism, by which I mean the extreme trust (e.g. the right to unilaterally fire people) placed in managers allow an environment where the manager's stated goals (which are often neither aligned with the corporate objective or the employee's needs, but the manager's career objectives) take priority. You have lots of indirection and wasted effort and, usually, morale problems as a result.<p>Open allocation, on the other hand, trusts people to work directly for the company. There are still leaders and followers, but the employees are implicitly trusted in deciding whom to follow.",1353068488

The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral roll control.<p>The concept of lateral control was basic to all aircraft designs; without it they could not be easily or safely controlled in flight.[7]<p>The broad protection intended by this patent succeeded when the Wrights won patent infringement lawsuits against Glenn Curtiss and other early aviators who devised ailerons to emulate lateral control described in the patent and demonstrated by the Wrights in their 1908 public flights. U.S. courts decided that ailerons were also covered by the patent.<p>[...]<p>The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue hindered their development of new aircraft designs, and by 1911 Wright aircraft were inferior to those made by other firms in Europe.[10] Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed to such an extent that when the country entered World War I no acceptable American-designed aircraft were available, and U.S. forces were compelled to use French machines.<p>In January 1914, a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict in favor of the Wrights against the Curtiss company, which continued to avoid penalties through legal tactics.<p>[...]<p>The patent pool solution<p>In 1917, the two major patent holders, the Wright Company and the Curtiss Company, had effectively blocked the building of new airplanes, which were desperately needed as the United States was entering World War I. The U.S. government, as a result of a recommendation of a committee formed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, pressured the industry to form a cross-licensing organization (in other terms a Patent pool), the Manufacturer's Aircraft Association.[11][12][13]",1353068282

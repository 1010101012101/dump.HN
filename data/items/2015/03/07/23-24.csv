Blockchain TLDs (like .bit) can be MITM-proofed. DNSChain also lets you communicate with blockchains over a MITM-proof HTTPS connection:<p><a href=""https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain/blob/master/docs/What-is-it.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain/blob/master/docs/What-...</a><p>> <i>not that such metadata isn&#x27;t rather obvious anyway by observing traffic between ips.</i><p>Tor is your best option if you want complete anonymity. DNSChain does have a planned feature called Unblock, which is effectively a DNS-based proxy that hides metadata as it travels between client and DNSChain, but if you want the best anonymity you should still use Tor.<p>DNSChain is a secure PKI solution (alternative to X.509), the primary purpose of which is to securely and simply distribute public keys, as that&#x27;s what provides protection from MITM attacks.<p>> <i>How is it any better than cacert? Because you pin the trust to your own ca? What stops you from doing that now (how is the trust different with dnschain?).</i><p>CACert is a CA. You can certainly design your software to only trust certificates from one CA, but that is only useful in special-purpose situations, it&#x27;s not going to work for general purpose browsing.<p>In X.509, everyone on the Internet is forced to trust the weakest link, and security decreases for everyone with the more CAs there are. The opposite is true with DNSChain-based PKI, where the more independent servers that are queried, the more certain you can be of the authenticity of the response. If you completely trust a particular DNSChain server, then it&#x27;s the only server you need to query.",1425772784

The patient was gagging horribly, the nurse was holding his head in place and forcing the oral syringe down his throat even as he was thrashing and making drowning noises, and after she finished she walked away even though he was coughing up medication all over his pillow.<p>My work partner and I saw this, and, with that creeped out feeling of &quot;did I just see what I think I saw?&quot; and &quot;something&#x27;s not right,&quot; we... left and took another call and went off to the hospital.

Bolt also does not support concurrent writers. I don&#x27;t need MVCC nor transactions, which have overhead. Finally, tree-based systems aren&#x27;t very good at doing large, sequential reads.<p>Edit: Again, not exactly sure about the downvoting, so here is a better explanation. If I&#x27;m wrong, please let me know!<p>Let&#x27;s say you insert many points for a few metrics in time order. Because of the way B-tree page allocation works, you can&#x27;t guarantee that the points for a metric will be stored in adjacent pages on disk (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). I want the guarantee that if I&#x27;m going to read points sequentially off a disk, I will do so without seeking around to different pages. Catena does that, and keeps points <i>very</i> compact.<p>When I used Bolt with a single key-value pair per point, I saw disk usage that was something like 50 bytes per point (on average). With Catena&#x27;s file partitions with compression, I see around 3 bytes per point (on average). These points are 8 byte timestamps with 4 byte values. That&#x27;s a huge benefit.",1425772555

In the meantime, for contiguous memory allocation, you can make use of off-heap memory (which also helps those &quot;more complex forms&quot;). But the flip side is that Java&#x27;s memory allocation is a lot faster than C&#x27;s (i.e. in throughput -- not latency, as there are GC pauses), and most GCs are copying collectors that automatically arrange objects contiguously (though it&#x27;s far from being good enough for arrays of object, as you need to follow references, and every object carries additional overhead, which is precisely why this is being addressed in Java 10).",1425772522

I read an article about an IBM standard for representing JSON in XML. Madness.<p>What XML does excel at is representing complex hierarchical data. The way Moya does forms (<a href=""https://github.com/moyaproject/sociallinks/blob/master/sociallinks/logic/forms.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/moyaproject/sociallinks/blob/master/socia...</a>) and models (<a href=""https://github.com/moyaproject/sociallinks/blob/master/sociallinks/logic/models.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/moyaproject/sociallinks/blob/master/socia...</a>) is actually quite terse, IMO. Especially if you consider the amount of encapsulation in those declarations. Forms for instance, <i>know</i> how to render, validate, and apply themselves.<p>Slightly more contentious is Moya Code which is a high level language expressed in XML. But it does mean that code and data can be mixed in a fairly effortless way. As a language, Moya Code is actually quite similar to Python. Not surprising since I&#x27;m a Python guy.<p>Here is a loop to print the numbers 1 to 10 in Python and Moya Code:<p><pre><code>    for i in range(1,11):\n        print(i)\n\n    <for src=&quot;1...10&quot; dst=&quot;i&quot;>\n        <echo>${i}</echo>\n    </for>\n</code></pre>\nMore characters to type in XML, but it is quite familiar.<p>The extra characters are offset somewhat by the fact that moya tags are very high-level. Imagine if your code to render a page was factored out so that at the top level was barely a dozen function calls and conditions. That&#x27;s what views in Moya Code tend towards.<p>Moya&#x27;s expressions also cut down on lines of code. The following gets the current price of Bitcoin from a web service:<p><pre><code>    <let btc=&quot;(fromjson:get:&#x27;https://www.bitstamp.net/api/ticker/&#x27;)[&#x27;ask&#x27;]&quot;/>\n</code></pre>\nLess contentious is the template language, which straightforward to use, and uses the same expressions as Moya Code. There&#x27;s no need to use a different syntax there. The most complex template for the Moya builtins is probably the threaded comments (<a href=""https://github.com/moyaproject/moya/blob/master/moya/libs/comments/templates/moya.comments/widgets/comments.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/moyaproject/moya/blob/master/moya/libs/co...</a>).

I don&#x27;t think possession/distribution/etc. alone would really be an issue (except if it were extremely recent and potentially ongoing), but clearly &quot;I was high and raped/killed my neighbor&quot; would, and either could arguably be &quot;drug related&quot;.  &quot;Was an addict and broken into cars to get money for drugs&quot; would be a more interesting corner case; nonviolent property crime.

I&#x27;m not really sure that people&#x27;s personal reactions to their own work environment ought to be called &quot;harassment,&quot; and I think &quot;inability to do your job&quot; is probably closer to the right term.<p>I can sympathize with that reaction for, like, deadlines. I do get a rising heart rate and an inability to concentrate on my work, as a tight deadline approaches and I&#x27;m behind on things. I don&#x27;t think that banning deadlines from the workplace is really the right answer. I&#x27;d rather just acknowledge that I&#x27;m bad at my job if I let this problem continue, and I should figure out a way to deal with this personal problem, if I want to keep my job.",1425769447

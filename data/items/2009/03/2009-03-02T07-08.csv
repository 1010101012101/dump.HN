On one hand, it's pretty unorthodox, especially for a snack food or junk food, which generally have product sites which are the web equivalent of the back of a cereal box, at best.<p>On the other hand, how many times has a marketing VP said ""get us on Facebook, get us on Wikipedia, get us on Twitter, get us on flickr, get us on YouTube!"" and had the advertising team reply with a site containing nothing but a set of six buttons which do nothing but that? Pretty hilarious.",1235980766

Would it be better if it had not been brought to light?<p>""Don't say anything"" isn't the only alternative to ""tell only part of the story"".<p>Woodward and Bernstein deliberately withheld relevant information to make themselves and their source look good.  If anyone else does that, the press screams ""coverup"", ""corruption"", etc.",1235980531

I want my exact power bill/consumption information to be visible on my computer somewhere in a similar way to Amazon's AWS dashboard, and I want to be able to turn on and off lights and stuff remotely.<p>All the technology for this exists, and it's very simple. But new homes just aren't built with it because there's no great company building the connection between the physical infrastructure of the home and the internet with great hardware + software.<p>Most new built-in central heaters and air conditioners have a standard digital communication interface that can easily be plugged into and controlled by this home computer. All power outlets and light sockets are connected to the powerline, and it's trivial to send data along powerlines.<p>The sensors to detect how much and at what temperature water is flowing through your pipes are cheap. You could probably build a totally connected home for a few hundred dollars (just for the hardware). That includes the power consumption information for every light socket, light switch, and outlet; every water socket, sink, shower, etc; and your heating and air conditioning system.<p>Can you imagine how much money you could save if you could see a dashboard of what is sucking up power in your house? Or if your house detected when all of your cars left the garage and lowered the heater target temperature? Or optimized light automatically by turning the dimmer up and down based on the natural light? Or sent you a text message when you left the doors unlocked in the morning? Or the heater is sucking up more power than normal for a longer time, so it gets shut off?<p>It could be monit + munin for your house.<p>Someone please build this. Or I will.",1235980429

499829,comment,499014,499443,0,0,anamax,,,"> Could we please have some examples? I can recall many cases where the press has made mistakes, but none where they were actively corrupt.<p>What definition of ""actively corrupt"" are we using?  Is it enough for them to get paid off in return for looking the other way/not reporting, or do they have to actually steal something?  Does it matter who pays them and what the connection is between the source of the money and the evil-doer.<p>Note that ""the press"" is often a cheap date.  They'll go out of their way to avoid writing bad things about folks/programs/issues that they like.  They'll trade access for non-coverage.<p>For example, CNN admits that they didn't report things that Saddam Hussein didn't want known in return for being able to report from pre-war Iraq.  That let them make money, money that didn't come from SH.  Do you count it as corruption?  (I don't, but many folks who get excited about corruption do.)",1235980078

Skittles on Facebook has nearly 600,000 fans, more than John McCain, who I assure you spent a LOT more money trying to get people to like him.<p>Sure, people will say stupid stuff and try to mess with it.

Libel lawsuits involving public figures are a small minority because they're almost impossible to win.  If the accused libeler can argue ""I'm part of the press"", it's even worse.<p>As a result, libel lawsuits aren't a factor in corruption investigations in the US.",1235979688

I thought my comment was over the top enough to be obvious.  But, I'm pretty sure every satirical comment I've made in the past couple of months here has been voted down.  Hackers love satire.

Right now I'm writing a paper which proves some properties about the efficient computability of functions -- because showing that these functions cannot be efficiently computed makes it possible to rely on them for security purposes.<p>Sure, tarsnap is unusual in the amount of cryptographic research behind it, but most interesting applications do <i>something</i> new at least.",1235979109

To me that's a huge display of confidence in their product.†<p>You say Skittles is wasting money and misdirecting effort, but it seems opposite. How much does this gimmick actually cost? All the content is hosted and delivered (and in some cases created) by other people. Skittles' site wasn't popular before and the next couple days will get a lot of hip people thinking about Skittles, so it's seems like a great move.<p>† It's also not that big a deal since it's, you know, candy, which usually puts people in a good mood.

For several months in the 1970's, a virtually unknown spook paralyzed the government of the most powerful nation on earth. And Woodward & Bernstein covered it up.<p>Refusing to name sources is about two things: actually protecting people in danger, and protecting your rep as a journalist. Felt's safety was never an issue. This is a man capable of bringing down the president, right? He was sitting on 50 years of dirty secrets collected by JE Hoover. No one dared touch him.<p>So B, W, and their editor kept quiet for purely selfish reasons. Then they willingly let themselves and their paper be used to settle a personal score against Nixon. They provided Felt with cover to make his leaks more effective. All the while they painted it as a home run for integrity and democracy, when in fact it was a political feud.<p>How is all of that not that a violation of the public trust, ie, corruption?",1235978831

Also, I'm betting that this was very, very cheap relative to other means of marketing.<p>I can only think of one other use for a website of a brand of food items: informing the visitor of other products under the same brand or made by the same company that the visitor might not know about. This design does a poor job of doing that, but I think a web site can be a trendy topic of discussion as well as informative if it's done the right way.",1235978734

That Twitter search stream aside, the rest of the content they have are pretty much regulated and closed despite being owned by a third party. YouTube has moderator tools, Flickr has moderator tools, Facebook fan pages have moderator tools. And Wikipedia is pretty darn hard to fuck with.<p>So, really, the only thing they don't have a direct control of is that Twitter search stream. However, Twitter is spending a lot of time right now deleting Skittles spam--I know this from personal experience!--and non-relevant tweets. I'm sure for Ev and team, Skittles is yet another big deal and they wouldn't want to fuck it up.<p>All in all, I really think this is genius and they're quite safe at protecting their brand's value.",1235978722

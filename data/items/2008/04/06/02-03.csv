I think WIMAX is being deployed soon in a few states though.",1207450774
155965,comment,155793,155835,0,0,dshah,,,"This doesn't seem right.  I'd venture to guess that there are many people that would make great advisors for a startup, but are not in a position to be investors.<p>Of course, it's better for advisors to have skin in the game and be investors too, but just the fact that a competent, experienced and passionate person is not investing does not necessarilyy make them bad advisors.<p>On a related note, not all startups need (or should have) investors.  Trying to get investors just to get good advisors seem arbitrarily limiting.",1207450521

155962,story,,,11,6,pius,"Life with the MacBook Air",http://www.tuaw.com/2008/04/05/life-with-the-macbook-air/,"<i>Perhaps it's due to the somewhat limited graphics capabilities of the MBA -- mostly due to its lack of a dedicated graphics card -- but it does, on occasion, have a bit of trouble with quick screen refresh and occasionally just gets bogged down completely. And yes, when it does this, you are treated to the spinning beachball show for several seconds until things get going again.</i><p>I'm looking forward to the 2nd or 3rd revision when the performance issues are resolved.",1207450247

It would like eliminating Calculus BC but keeping AB---bad, but not catastrophic.<p>As a former taker of the CS AB exam (back in the Pascal (!) days), it does make me sad, though.",1207448675

Then when a real but mundane threat like overuse of antibiotics comes up, it gets very little play. I suppose TV News is just bad at getting the real story because they need to captivate the audience in 3 seconds.",1207448241

A Shakespearean sonnet, on the other hand, would score high both horizontally and vertically, yielding a massive total area, thereby revealing the poem to be truly great. As you proceed through the poetry in this book, practice this rating method. As your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows, so will, so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry.""<p>I don't hear enough rip!",1207448199

Our goal is to build the best free repository of data on the web, like a 'flickr for datasets' or the almanac to wikipedia's encyclopedia.  There's some similar, excellent work being done by numbrary.com, swivel.com and Freebase, and we intend to complement those projects (as well as to fuel and inspire the projects you all are building).  The difference between infochimps and those sites is we're 'messy' -- we'll take the data as it stands, and we'll give it to you with no restrictions and no sandbox, to play with on your machine with your tools.  As people find various datasets interesting or useful and thus choose to enhance them (better formats, more metadata), we'll make it easy to share those contributions back.<p>If you're excited about this project and want to help it grow, please (<a href=""http://help.infochimps.org/help/show/Contact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.infochimps.org/help/show/Contact</a>) contact us.  The site's still in rough shape, but there's a lot there to love.  You can also follow along with the development at our blog -- <a href=""http://blog.infochimps.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.infochimps.org/</a>",1207447738
155944,comment,155793,155848,0,0,pg,,,"You can have informal advisors who aren't investors.  But it's usually a bad idea to have a board of advisors, for example, or to give stock to people who want it in return for being an advisor, yet for some reason don't want to actually invest in you.<p>The one exception is when you're a grad student and start a startup based on your research.  Then it's common to give your (faculty) advisor some stock.",1207447645
155943,comment,155601,155837,0,0,rebelprince,,,"The exciting thing about Asterisk to me is not how well it can replicate traditional PBXs, but that it allows you to deal with voice communications programmatically, with a very low barrier to entry. This allows all kinds of experimentation with voice and touch tone, which was previously inaccessible to hackers in an accessible way. Having a UI option for input/output that works with any touch tone phone is starting to produce interesting projects. I've used Asterisk for a real-world game and an automated booty call system (ahem). And friends of mine are using it as an interface for games on large screens (playmegaphone.com) and an interface for networked objects (botanicalls.com). These are things it was never intended to do, but because it's turned the phone system into software, you can hack it and repurpose it. And that's why it's interesting, not the fact that it may-or-may-not replace corporate PBXs.",1207447627

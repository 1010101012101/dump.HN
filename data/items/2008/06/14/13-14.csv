I've even used one of their old puzzles (Addagram) in (surely) 100+ interviews where I walk candidates through building up the different considerations in this puzzle. It degenerates or upgrades well for the level of engineer being hired, and when we hire them, it's not uncommon for those engineers to come back with me and work through it some more.<p>Oddly, one of my friends (absolutely brilliant guy) sent ITA a few solutions and they interviewed him. I know an interview isn't overly efficient, but I lost a good bit of respect for ITA when they didn't offer this guy a position or further interviews. The guy is brilliant and dedicated-- it's always possible that doesn't come through in any given interview. Still, it's good as it means it's easier to get this fellow involved in my startup when needed.<p>Add-a-gram for the curious:\n<a href=""http://itasoftware.com/careers/puzzle_archive.html?catid=39#Add-A-Gram"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itasoftware.com/careers/puzzle_archive.html?catid=39#...</a>",1213451799

It was the sunlight which did it. It was bright shining through the shades and when I lived in the basement, I had no windows.",1213451738

We live in a global economy, why should I have to pay extra to someone who thinks that his/her citizenship entitles him/her to an above-market wage when there is a hard working person willing to do the work for less?<p>It is disgraceful that hardworking people all over the world starve while here in the US people feel entitled to complain about their jobs being ""taken"".",1213451495

My wife and I visited the MIT campus a few years back, and she attracted more attention to us than I would have alone. She knows next to nothing about technology, but it didn't matter. Note, I'm not trying to knock MIT girls, just giving you a tip to get into some labs. Also, MIT folks are very nice and open, not elitist at all, in my experience.",1213450888

If only your friends (that you've opted in) can send you mail via this system, then your inbox there will be completely spam-free.<p>I was hoping for FB to offer that, but most people don't log in to FB often enough for it to be a reliable mail network. Email still wins. If Orgoo can shift that balance so that people check their email on the social networks, that's a killer app right there - possibly the best use, today, of the ""social utility"" aspect of a site like Facebook.",1213450736

217513,comment,217411,217411,0,0,senthil_rajasek,,,"Other than the cost and the admin factors building, deploying and debugging/troubleshooting web applications in ASP.NET environment simply rocks! Not to mention the IIS sweetness and scalability models.<p>I have a facebook application (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=5595659604"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=5595659604</a>) that I built using the LAMP stack, something quick and dirty . I like the LAMP stack and have nothing against RoR but be prepared to spend a lot of engineering resources in scaling these.<p>Case in point try debugging a web server crash in your favorite RoR web server vs ASP.NET/IIS environment.",1213450137

217511,comment,217411,217411,0,0,goofygrin,,,"Three things:<p>1. Look at the MVC framework for ASP.NET 3.5 as it makes ASP.NET act more like Rails<p>2. If you're going to use ASP.NET, use 3.5 so you can use LINQ and all the new 3.5 features.  It makes your life WAY easier.<p>3. There is no real scaffolding for ASP.NET like there is in RoR.  Well there is a kind of like it thing that was put out (<a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PuttingASPNETDynamicDataIntoContext.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PuttingASPNETDynamicDataIntoCo...</a>).<p>Now, here's my take... if you learn ASP.NET/C# you will have marketable skills in most non silicon valley markets that you can use as a consultant or employee as need be.  There are significantly less corporate jobs that are RoR than there are C#/ASP.NET.<p>Also make sure you look at Python/Django (which is normally what is argued with RoR).",1213449966
217510,comment,217411,217434,0,0,goofygrin,,,"Wow, I live in Dallas and the .NET community is very large here (have you attended any of the .NET user group meetings?)<p>Honestly I find the OSS community to be very weak here since most developers are corporate type and they know either Java or C# or VB.NET.  Every OSS (Python) meeting I've ever been to has been populated by back room tinkerers and people that ""haven't done it"" (tm) so they aren't any help to me with my real world questions and problems.<p>Now if you expect <i>any</i> college to put out good developers you have the wrong expectations for what college does.  They are not Devry (which you should never hire a developer from Devry).  Colleges teach theory not practice (which has been beaten like a dead horse on the net).",1213449753

Trying to summarize that experience will sound classist, so I won't, but I'll just say that I've noticed some patterns, and certain groups here don't hide the chip on their shoulder and can be very punchy.<p>The tech and intellectual social circles here are great, though.

217505,comment,217411,217411,0,0,ericb,,,"ASP.net would be my second-choice to ruby on rails. It's a close call. If Castle's ActiveRecord was better when I tried it, I would have probably never delved into rails ages ago. I'm glad I did though.<p>In favor of Rails:<p>-There are pre-existing FOSS social network apps in rails you can modify.<p>-You have infinite scalability where your only multiplier is hosting cost b/c there are no windows licenses, so no obstacles to moving into the cloud, virtualizing, setting up a friend<p>-With rails, you are mostly saved from SQL. Castle's activerecord might do this on .net, but was lousy when I tried it a while ago. Might be better now.<p>-It is easy to be coddled by ASP.NET and not understand the parts underneath, which works well until the abstraction leaks (viewstate, page layout, etc).<p>That said, asp.net is not a bad option, and would be my second choice over the java frameworks I've tried, or php. .NET has a nice IDE and better tooling than Rails.",1213448616

Im not that much in to it, but i learned how to concentrate for a while on something(eg. my breathing) And in bed i just concentrate on something like that, don't brutforce yourself not to think, just take your mind away from it.

RoR was unstable as heck for me and was missing some features that were dead simple in asp.net. (At the time I couldn't find a good zip library, the one I found had documentation in Japanese).<p>If I were comparing asp.net to something I would consider django or just PHP.  PHP has a heck of a deployment story.  I run MANY wordpress blogs on the side and centos/mysql/apache/php is rock solid AND fast.<p>My 2 cents.",1213448508

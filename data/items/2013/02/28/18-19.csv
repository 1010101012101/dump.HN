5300197,comment,5299009,5299009,4,0,dworin,,,"Enough people have pointed out the importance of value pricing over hourly billing that I don't have anything to add there.<p>But I will bring up a neglected point, which is that this formula assumes that all employees hours are equal, or at least indistinguishable enough that you can take an average, and completely ignores the idea of leverage in professional services.  Leverage is how you make a professional services firm a profitable, growing business, and not just a series of contractors that you farm out.<p>To start thinking about leverage, you need to realize that not all of your employees are the same, so a globally blended rate doesn't make sense.  Some of them are junior level employees who are smart and capable, but still learning the ropes.  They benefit from your firm's intellectual property, so they're able to add value greater than their salary would indicate.  At the top, you have the firm's principals or partners, who tend to have less time to spend doing work, because they're busy trying to market the firm and win new business.  So even though their rate may be higher, it's spread across fewer hours.  In the middle are either technical experts or managers who are able to command a higher rate, and can mentor others, but aren't quite ready to bring in new business on their own.<p>As your employees learn and become capable of better work, they also become more valuable to you, which means you should pay them more, which means their rates should go up accordingly.  But now you need them to do more valuable work, so you also need to find new junior people to replace them.  This is how you help your employees grow, and it's how you help your firm grow.<p>Your firm's profitability comes from the fact that you can charge greater than an employees costs to your clients.  That's the basic idea behind a services business, otherwise you're all just independent contractors.  So your source of profits is the amount you charge on top of your employee costs, and that could vary by level.<p>The number of people at each level, and the amount you charge for them, depends on the nature of your work and your firm. Figuring out the rate balance and the right growth rate is one of the most important parts of managing your firm (probably second to creating a great culture, although the two are related).<p>The reason that the firm in the article is able to raise more revenue by raising prices is because they've been undervaluing their own work this whole time.  Once the price starts to better reflect value, the way you grow is by sustainably hiring in new people and growing them with the firm - the price mechanism is money that's currently being left on the table, it's not a growth mechanism.",1362077688

The machine can sense when you stop breathing, and adjust the pressure accordingly.<p>It's not always as easy as just strapping on a CPAP and seeing if it works.

Using a CPAP with central sleep apnea can cause serious problems.<p>There are several different things that can cause poor sleep. So just giving them a machine may miss some important things.<p>Also, CPAP machines can really screw with your blood chemistry.<p>I used a CPAP for a three or four years. Overall I had better quality sleep, but there were lots of difficulties and some very long stretches where I think I was much worse off for using the machine.<p>Depending on the type of sleep apnea a CPAP can make it worse.<p>Oh, you can sometimes find CPAP machines at swap meets and craigslist, if you look around.

5300170,comment,5298520,5299611,6,0,betterunix,,,"General computation on encrypted data was discovered by a graduate student at Stanford named Craig Gentry.  He now works for IBM, and has been pretty active in that field, along with a handful of other experts.  It's very slow, sure, but over the past 4 years speeds have increased to the point where it is reasonable to start talking about practical applications.<p>It is also worth pointing out that systems supported <i>restricted</i> classes of functions preceded Gentry's work.  If you are willing to limit yourself to NC1 functions (i.e. those that can be represented as boolean circuits with depth that is the logarithm of the input size), you can use oblivious transfer or the SYY construction (cannot recall their names off the top of my head).  If you only need products in certain groups, you can use ElGamal.  If you only need an XOR, you can use the Goldwasser-Micali system.<p>Also, there are garbled circuits, which date back to the 1980s.  That is a somewhat different notion of computing on encrypted data, since it requires messages to be sent every time the computation is performed.  Garbled circuits are substantially faster than FHE right now, although that may change due to FHE's low communication overhead and the rate at which FHE speeds have been improving.  Also in this category are multiparty protocols that use arithmetic circuits, which have seen at least one major real-world use:<p><a href=""http://fc09.ifca.ai/papers/15_Secure_MPC_goes_live.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fc09.ifca.ai/papers/15_Secure_MPC_goes_live.pdf</a>",1362077307

Not to recite, but the interviewer will probably ask you some ""situational"" questions where she asks for you to demonstrate dealing with some specific type of problem in the past. So you need examples. And you won't be able to think of them on the spot. So think of them now. The format some interviewers use is STAR - Situation, Task, Action, Response. Describe what the problem was, what you had to do, what you did and how it turned out.<p>This is not a strategic suggestion, but a tactical suggestion.

You must literally infringe every single word (that's why patent Claims <i>seem</i> so awkwardly worded).<p>Simply not do ANY ONE OF THE following:<p>> ""series of episodes""<p>So a single episode and you may avoid infringement<p>> ""performing, from time to time, one of a sequence of update operations""<p>So eliminate periodic operations, or sequence of updates and you may avoid infringement<p>> ""each of said update operations comprising: downloading via the Internet the current version of a compilation file identified by a predetermined known URL""<p>So either don't identify using known URL (admittedly not likely but worth mentioning), avoid what they defined ""compilation file"" to be, or even avoid ""predetermined"" and you may avoid infringement<p>> "", and storing attribute data contained in said current version of said compilation file in said digital memory, said attribute data describing one or more episodes in a series of episodes""<p>Now it starts sounding like ""compilation file"" is more than just a mp3 file.  So the first support I find (CTRL-F is your friend) related is:<p>> ""The download compilation file 145, though represented as a single file in FIG. 1, preferably takes the form of one or more subscriber and session specific files which contain the identification of separately stored sharable files. By way of example, the recommended order and the identification of the program files making up an individual playback session are stored in a session schedule file (to be described in detail in connection with FIG. 5) which contains program identifiers of the program segments to be played during an upcoming session. The player 103 downloads the session schedule file and then issues download requests for those identified program segment files which are not already available in the player's local storage unit 107.""<p>Add to this, FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, and it looks like compilation file includes one or more things like indexes, transcripts, condensed content, topic description, paragraphs, etc...\nSo avoiding this ""compilation file"" is probably their best bet - just serve straight up mp3 files and you may avoid infringement but compile mp3 into these ""compilation files"" and you're infringing.<p>What troubles me is that I'm not an expert but yet have found plenty of options for Carolla/etc to avoid this (and relatively cheaply).

Medical Partners provide care to patients accepted by Watsi operating under the guarantee that the cost of care will be paid for by donors.

Running as a user and protecting root without running unnecessary services is your first step, after that it's all kind of iffy.<p>Signing something from an untrusted source (Having dealt with having to revoke a bunch of Microsoft signed stuff not too long ago, I assure you Microsoft is not infallible) doesn't buy you a whole lot.  If you build a driver yourself and sign it, ok.  Actually that's probably the best way, download the nvidia driver, sign it with your own one-time key, and voila, even if someone pulls a Folgers Commercial on your driver, they really can't sign it, they don't even know where the one-time key came from.<p>For a normal user, the effort to try and hack your own signing mechanism seems like it would be non-trivial.  Figuring out how to hack a giant 'trusted' signer is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  I would not be suprised if there are more compromised signing authorities right now.  Flame was signed with a msft key that was actually not meant to sign code, but for several years, since this key was from msft, people happily loaded and ran flame.<p>I don't really think it's FUD to say trusting your security to the entity that attracts the most attention is not a great plan.<p>Your points are good, except I disagree that Linux's only beef is parsing PE files, I think that's really the least of his concerns.  Msft could deliver up its keys in any form, it won't solve the insecurity of not knowing if your signer has been breached.<p>Good security is hard, I think that's the main problem with all of Linus's ideas.",1362076282

One of the judges asked:  ""How much of the capital you are raising is going to be spent on overhead?"".  The presenter didn't really have an answer for that.<p>It made me think about the situation of a pure ""virtual"" (no physical products made or shipped) 'net-based startup with, say, two or three developers, rent, computers, a few servers and the usual embryonic startup-level infrastructure.

It will reach a point after which you get diminishing marginal gain, or even negative gain.<p>For a startup I believe agility is critically important.  I would be worried to add too many people from the outset because it is difficult reverse it.  It's hard to 'unfounder' a cofounder later on.

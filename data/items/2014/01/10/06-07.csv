And you have my sympathies.  Being forced to use the mouse is a drag, and I would argue, a cruel thing to do to users from an accessibility standpoint.  This (without going deeply into it) is what ultimately binds me to my &quot;limited&quot; set of inputs: keystroke.  Yet being bound to the keyboard interface has only helped my productivity.

It seems like the number of reports is not important but the user&#x27;s ROI goal from the collection of reports is where the value is.<p>So in this scenario, say you don&#x27;t know what the end user is planning to do with the collection of reports and that the user themselves might not have a clear idea of ROI until the  report is in their hands and they are able to extract some value from it. Simply having more of it does not necessarily  guarantee value but rather what they do afterwards that determine the value of the reports and the quality of the reports (which they choose the data source).<p>Does this make sense? Basically the issue I&#x27;m raising is, what if you can&#x27;t predict a positive ROI from the reports generated by the user of your software until their intentions with the report is known and after they take action?<p>...but someone will argue the act of generating the reports automatically and the volume of reports generated IS the value. This argument also has merit because if they were to hire someone to do this, it would cost them X amount of money and using software saves them X amount of dollar and time. The quality of the data source they chose to generate the reports is outside of the software&#x27;s control.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just overthinking this...but it does seem like metered billing makes sense because in order to generate the same number of reports, it would cost time and money. If somebody determines that they can do it better and faster and cheaper but still wants to use the software and not pay for even 1/10 of the cost of hiring someone to do it, then maybe they are a niche to not pay attention to. Maybe there&#x27;s no money in that niche, and it should be ignored altogether. Perhaps even targeting this niche that is resistant to paying for even 1/10 of the cost of generating reports without the software should not play a factor in pricing.",1389334819

Occasionally some things were surprisingly more expensive, and others were surprisingly cheap. The 100yen (~$1) stores were better stocked than in the US and I could get most things I needed from them. They also were located in malls and were very nice to shop in. Things like sushi that I expected to be cheaper were about the same price as back in the US (which was seriously disappointing!), and cheaper food was seriously cheap and relatively healthy. I lost like 20 lbs eating all those beef bowls and noodles. Trains were not super cheap, but not overly expensive. It&#x27;s way way waaaayyyy cheaper than Europe and unlike in Europe they privately owned, aren&#x27;t subsidized and make a profit which was a relief to hear (I can&#x27;t think of another country that has an unsubsidized public transportation system) I think the bus from Tokyo to Kyoto was about 40 bucks (my memory is a bit hazy). . Owning a car and driving places from what I understood is extremely expensive. I think most of my coworkers didn&#x27;t own cars. A relatively short drive on the freeway can easily set you back $50 (tolls roads everywhere).

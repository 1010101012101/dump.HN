8084668,comment,8084302,8084302,2,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"I think the real failure of FP has been demonstrating its advantages in practical terms. While deferring impurity is admittedly interesting (if you care about the theoretical underpinnings of programming at all) what do I gain as a programmer?<p>I&#x27;ll try to illustrate my point:<p>In programming we often have to do something more than once. In terms of mental complexity, I&#x27;d rank our options like so, from easy to hard:<p>Loop -> Recursion -> Fixed Point Iteration<p>We can do the same thing with all of them. Recursion in some cases can lead to a stack overflow and any fixed point iteration has the disadvantage of, well, being f-ing hard to understand.<p>A beginner can get a `while` or a `for` loop in seconds. They&#x27;re very, very intuitive. Once you figure out solving problems in software often requires doing things repeatedly, loops open up a lot of power.<p>Recursion is more difficult once you throw in conditionals and return values. They&#x27;re harder to reason about. Loops are simple. So why bother with recursion? I learned recursion because it exists and I love learning. Could I have written just as much software without it? Yes. Would it have been just as functionally correct, maintainable, easy to read? Yes.<p>I know very little about fixed point iteration. Why? Well, because I have loops and if I&#x27;m feeling jaunty, recursion.<p>Having said that, I recently came across this article about the Y combinator:<p><a href=""http://matt.might.net/articles/implementation-of-recursive-fixed-point-y-combinator-in-javascript-for-memoization/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://matt.might.net/articles/implementation-of-recursive-f...</a><p>I recommend that article for everyone. But the most important part is the section &quot;Exploiting the Y combinator&quot;.<p>> This formulation still has exponential complexity, but we can change it to linear time just by changing the fixed-point combinator. The memoizing Y combinator, Ymem, keeps a cache of computed results, and returns the pre-computed result if available:<p>The author is talking about his algorithm for calculating Fibonacci numbers. While the naive recursive approach is limited due to its computation complexity, by caching intermediate results we can short-circuit the calculations made.<p>> The end result is that the 100th Fibonacci number is computed instantly, whereas the naive version (or the version using the ordinary Y combinator) would take well beyond the estimated lifetime of the universe.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about what&#x27;s being done here to say that this optimization couldn&#x27;t have been made with a loop (I believe Turing equivalence proves that it could have been) but at least I get to see some of the magic that fixed point iteration gives us.<p>Haskell, as a functional language, offers a lot (purity! type safety!) but the community hasn&#x27;t really shown <i>how</i> these things are valuable. Type safety is great, but is Haskell materially better than Objective-C (my primary language) in that regard? Pure functions are trivial to test, but in a language with a reasonable amount of type safety, how many individual functions are getting tested anyway? Of course I can write pure functions in an imperative language and often do. And I can do so without painfully abstract concepts like the dreaded monad if I want to do something as pedestrian as generate a random number.<p>The reality is writing software for most people is about the platform they&#x27;re targeting, available libraries, ease of use and techniques for dealing with long-term complexity. I have yet to find a reason to use Haskell even though I would love to -- more accurately, I have yet to find a situation where I could justify using Haskell.",1406287820

8084575,comment,8082902,8084103,1,0,fpgeek,,,"Frankly, the only perspective I care about in this mess is mine - that of a non-EU Google user. I&#x27;m only reasoning from Google&#x27;s because I want to understand how these EU regulations are likely to impact me. Now that EU regulators are making it clear they won&#x27;t be satisified by compliance tailored to their jurisdiction, it&#x27;s clear that they will. Which is just wrong.<p>There&#x27;s no sensible reason for EU regulations to have anything to do with the search results that I (as a non-EU citizen, searching from outside the EU, most likely using entirely non-EU servers, network connections and so on) see. I agree that the EU has the economic and political power to impose these regulations (on Google, Bing, Yahoo, ...). I just think that, even though they can, they shouldn&#x27;t.<p>This is exactly the same sort of extraterritorial bullshit that drives the EU (and EU citizens) nuts when the US does it. See, for example, the US government demanding, from Microsoft, the emails of EU citizens stored on EU servers in response to a US search warrant. Or the volumes of requirements (tax monitoring, sanctions compliance and so on) the US imposes on non-US banks even when their only US connection is they sometimes transfer dollars between non-US customers.<p>EU citizens and EU regulators might care deeply about the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;, but if they think that endorsing and emulating the US&#x27;s extraterritorial grandstanding in its name is going to be anything but a gigantic net loss for European privacy, they&#x27;re kidding themselves, at best. Google&#x27;s response to the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; has been disappointing and frustrating (though I doubt we&#x27;d agree on why). What similarly powerful governments (e.g. US, China, ...) end up doing with the new tools the EU is forging to enforce that right will be terrifying.",1406286058

You just need to include the right parameters.<p>Instead of<p><pre><code>    readFile(file_name)\n</code></pre>\nYou just do<p><pre><code>    readFile(file_name,complete_description_of_the_universe)\n</code></pre>\nIf you change the value of complete_description_of_the_universe, then you&#x27;ve changed the input to your function, and of course you&#x27;re going to get a different result back.<p>Granted, a full complete_description_of_the_universe is rather space consuming.  I don&#x27;t even think it would fit on a floppy.  Maybe a Zip drive?<p>Thankfully, you don&#x27;t need the COMPLETE description.  You only need the parts that your computer can access.  There&#x27;s no reason to store the amount of gas in the bowels of every elephant in India, unless you actually have an elephant gas sensor.  So our function is really<p><pre><code>    readFile(file_name,complete_description_of_everything_the_computer_measure)\n</code></pre>\nOf course, that still means that the second parameter contains the contents of every bit on the hard drive, since the GMR sensor can measure those bits.  Some lousy manufacturers are now selling computers that don&#x27;t even have enough memory to hold their entire hard drive contents.  Thankfully, we can use another optimization.<p>Since, by definition, the computer can measure the value of complete_description_of_everything_the_computer_measure, there&#x27;s no reason to store it in memory at all.  We just measure it when it&#x27;s needed.  Granted, it&#x27;s a little slow to read the hard drive, versus having the entire drive stored in memory, but premature optimization and all that.<p>It&#x27;s still completely functional, though.  We still pass the function two parameters.  The first parameter is a set of bytes in memory with a EBCDIC representation of the name of the file.  The second parameter is a physical computer that can perform the measurements.  As long as you pass the exact same computer to the readFile function, you&#x27;ll get the same result every time.<p>Same thing for writeFile.  We pass in a physical computer and the function returns to us a new, physical computer that&#x27;s similar to the one that we passed in, except that this computer has some different magnetic spin arrangements on its hard drive and its system clock is reading a different value.<p>Granted, carrying all of these physical computers around gets tiring, plus people start giving you guff about conservation of mass or whatever whenever you make a new computer.  Thankfully, the functional compiler guys have found ways to optimize the code so that you can destroy the unneeded computers very rapidly.  In fact, it&#x27;s faster than the human eye can detect.  Without careful measurement, you&#x27;d think that it was just one computer the whole time.",1406286056

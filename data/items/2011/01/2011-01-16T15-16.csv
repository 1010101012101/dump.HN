2109530,comment,2109012,2109340,0,0,bane,,,"I spend a bit of time in South Korea and can say this:<p>1) South Korea is similarly more advanced than the West in some ways and less in others.<p>Large transportation infrastructure in South Korea is among the best I've seen, both because it is so comprehensive and because it is so new. So for example, the Seoul subway is easily comparable to the NYC subway in terms of size and coverage, but feels much nicer because it's so much newer. The stations are larger, the trains are new, etc. Similarly, Korean rail is easily as good as the best you'll find in Europe. The National Highway system is comprehensive, modern and easy to navigate.<p>Communications infrastructure is fantastic, easily the best I've seen. Very fast high speed internet everywhere, great mobile service, digital mobile TV in the subway, etc. etc.<p>Some infrastructure is not as good. In the well developed parts of the cities things like sewage aren't a problem, but you quickly drop off the development cliff as you head away from city center. Public restrooms are infrequent and typically dirty. If they have toilet paper, count yourself lucky. (However, the tap water is considered quite clean and drinkable by world health authorities even if the locals habitually don't drink it out of decade's old habit when things weren't quite as good). Farm areas are like farm areas anywhere, lots of dirt and plants and animals, but because of the difficult terrain, bringing modern mass farming practices has been very difficult and has left rural areas very undeveloped in relation to what you might find in the U.S. or Europe.<p>There's a huge disparity in things like construction quality. Some areas have impressive, modern buildings. Some areas (particularly older areas built up in the late 70s early 80s) look shabby and have issues associated with shoddy construction.<p>2) Software in the South Korea is...not as advanced as in the West, but from the sounds of it, in better shape than in Japan.<p>There's a pretty thriving games industry that's as good as any average or better than average western developed games. There's also a pretty sizable contract software industry. Mostly Western firms who've setup shop to take advantage of highly educated developers and slightly lower pay.<p>Though the Internet is high speed, for various reasons, almost entirely legal (that would involve thousands of words to properly explain and would probably require a dive into South Korean Social Security law believe it or not), browser technology and techniques are stuck with IE6 era sites. This means lots and lots and lots of flash everywhere to make things look good. However, the design work is about as good as what you'll normally find in the west. Nothing spectacular, they aren't pushing the boundaries of usability, but there's a sophistication in the sites that makes them equivalent to say reddit or amazon.<p>Here's two of the most popular sites
<a href=""http://www.daum.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daum.net/</a>
<a href=""http://www.naver.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.naver.com/</a><p>I think one thing that helps is that the South Koreans have a strong tradition in graphic design and the arts that at least helps make things look pleasant even if the interfaces can be a little ""off"". But you can see it everywhere, mundane signs in the grocery store for example, are put together with harmonious color schemes and beautiful typography. It's wholly different than Japanese aesthetic (and Chinese for that matter), and seems to have made it's way onto the web more or less.<p>I've never really encountered encoding issues or the like, I guess most places have moved on to UTF-8.<p>Most people at home have older, less powerful computers, but laptops and netbooks are extremely common. Apple computers...I think I've seen one, one time. And *nix is almost unknown. iPhones are starting to get popular, but most people have phones that better work in South Korea since they also have digital TV reception (yes, it's broadcast over the air) and near field payment chips and such in the phones.<p>3) Facebook is not heavily used (if at all) compared to other social media sites.",1295193287

Those terrorists could turn on Iran. 'Suckers you gave us a nuke, but now we want more or else.' Any proliferation at all would alter the balance of power. The Iraninan regime know this, and I predict that the only thing the regime wants more than to destroy Israel is to stay in power whilst watching this happen, and giving away nukes would not necessarily bode all that well with this goal. Terrorists with nukes could usurp power in Iran before they even lay a finger on Israel.<p>add: In my opinion, the most Iran can hope for is a direct confrontation with Israel that involves nuclear missiles, which ideally would see the decimation of Israel. These missiles will be fired from Iran. But I think there would be an Iranian uprising or some type of coup before that occurs: the people of Iran like themselves more than they hate Israel, and definitely don't want to suicide for it. Israel also has counter-measures to defend against it.<p>Iranian controlled mobile nuke scuds parked in south Lebanon - that's a possibility, but not now at least.

If I recall correctly, we're still talking single-digit megabytes of RAM being the most you could reasonably expect. Browser authors are still feeling through the hardest text layout problem since TeX, and browsers are expected to do it realtime, on processors that today we'd consider low-medium end embedded processors. A problem still giving them fits, I might add; how many of us still feel our browsers render slowly even with machines a <i>hundred times more powerful</i>? Yes, we don't render the same pages, but that just proves my point more, the desire to do these computationally expensive things was there in 1994 but a page that takes 1 second to render today is, well, not even guessable back then because you probably ran out of RAM.<p>It wouldn't have mattered if they had suddenly had an attack of the stupid and tried to implement the hopelessly-idealistic-for-1994 CSS spec.

The short-run deficit MUST be high right now.<p>In the current policy debate, debt is often invoked as a reason to dismiss calls for expansionary fiscal policy as a response to unemployment; you can’t solve a problem created by debt by running up even more debt.<p>It assumes, implicitly, that debt is debt -- that it doesn't matter who owes the money. Yet that can't be right; if it were, debt wouldn't be a problem in the first place. After all, to a first approximation debt is money we owe to ourselves. The overall level of debt makes no difference to aggregate net worth -- one person's liability is another person's asset.<p>The level of debt matters only because the distribution of that debt matters. Borrowing by some actors now can help cure problems created by excess borrowing by other actors in the past. Deficit-financed government spending can allow the economy to avoid unemployment and deflation while highly indebted private-sector agents repair their balance sheets, and the government can pay down its debts once the deleveraging crisis is past.",1295191167
2109450,comment,2109367,2109367,0,0,bluedevil2k,,,"Fixing Social Security - it's always up for discussion and nothing ever gets done about it.  The frustrating part is that the solution is somewhat simple, but politically it's untouchable.  Here's my quick & simple solution for the problem:<p>1)  Phase out Social Security benefits if your income level hits $50k that year.  
- This aspect of Social Security is perhaps most baffling - why does someone who is making $250k a year on their pension and 401k distributions getting the same amount of Social Security as someone who's destitute and barely getting by?  ""But I paid into it, I should get something out of it!"" goes the argument by rich people.  Really?  I pay into my car insurance every 6 months, never been in an accident, and I don't get a refund check when I'm done driving!  Social Security is insurance, it's not a deferred savings plan.  Social Security is really called FICA, and the ""I"" stands for insurance.  It's insurance in case you don't have enough money to survive in old age, and the benefit payouts should reflect that.  Someone making over 100k a year doesn't need another 25k a year in Social Security benefits to survive.<p>2)  Take away the cap on contributions.  Last year any dollar you made above $106k wasn't taxed at the 6.2% FICA rate.  Why?<p>3)  Make the Social Security Administration an independent entity free from Congress's whims, and more importantly, free from Congress's hands dipping into its pockets every time they need cash.  Social Security <i>should</i> have a huge surplus right now in cash, as over the years they've always had more pay-in than pay-outs.  Too bad Congress took all that money and spent it.  Social Security is full of government bonds right now, essentially IOU's from Congress that ""we promise to pay you back"".<p>Combine #1 and #2 and you have a simple solution to both decrease payouts and increase pay-ins. Add #3 and you're assured that this institution (which isn't some evil socialist creation but really should be thought of as ""poverty insurance"") can be a self-sustaining, solvent part of our country forever.",1295191152

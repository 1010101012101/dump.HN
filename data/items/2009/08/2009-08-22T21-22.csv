I'm working on a new app right now which I feel there is no value in openly exposing it prior to launch.  Even after launch, I'm only going to market directly to my end user and not seek wide-scale exposure.  I have discussed the niche I'm going after with a few trusted advisors and that is all I need to verify I'm thinking straight.  Exposing it early may not introduce a copy cat, but in my case may cause other problems.  I know, I'm being a bit mysterious, but there it is ;).",1250978338

RapidMind included a JIT compiler which converted the code into optimized multicore x86 code or to GPU code (initially they compiled to shader programs but not sure whether they finally compiled to something like CUDA code). The allure of RapidMind was that you write code once and it can run on CPU or GPU. By acquiring RapidMind, Intel is now controlling one of the APIs people may have used to program GPUs from Nvidia or AMD.<p>(Though I must also add that I didnt really like RapidMind API very much.

The author describes at length the process he had to go through to decode this supposedly clear communication. The one person without a vested interest in the formula (his wife) just found it puzzling and annoying. Besides, it's obvious how to communicate the information ""I've been in an accident, but I'm ok"" straightforwardly.<p>I kept hoping that the story would turn out to be a clever parody of the father's pet theory by an impudent son. That, as anyone who has been mercilessly imitated by offspring knows, is what children are made for. But no such luck.<p>It reminds me of a book I read years ago by a psychologist who used to insist that people (including his children) speak in active tenses so as to take responsibility for things. Instead of saying, ""The milk got spilled,"" one should say, ""I spilled the milk,"" and so on. He knew he had gone too far when his 8-year-old came in soaking wet one day and said ""Sorry Dad. I guess I rained all over myself.""<p>This kind of thing appeals to technical people who like algorithms for things and want algorithms for human interaction. But that's a category error. Engineers who really want to get better at communication would get further by paying more attention to their audience (and themselves).",1250975529

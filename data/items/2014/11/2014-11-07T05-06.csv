If B can anticipate A&#x27;s action (not that hard in this case, because I can do it after a couple of beers) then B may choose not to invest because B&#x27;s road to a profit requires producing at a lower marginal cost than A and undercutting A&#x27;s prices.

I&#x27;m certainly biased because I do it for a living, and the evidence I can offer is certainly anecdotal but I&#x27;ve run ROI positive campaigns based entirely off facebook and twitter ads. In fact I&#x27;ve done advertising for a $1,000,000+ grossing product where 98% of downloads could be directly contributed to an ad we ran while remaining ROI positive.<p>I don&#x27;t entirely dismiss your point though. I think the large scale buying of billions of impressions is certainly broken. Big advertising agencies have taken to just throwing tons of ops people at the problem.<p>I think the real shift, and the pioneering ways forward are going to be a combination of social ads that are highly segmented, and then what I call &quot;digital experiential&quot; This: <a href=""http://sortieenmer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sortieenmer.com/</a> is a good example of what I mean.<p>Basically, buying banner ads really efficiently aren&#x27;t enough anymore.

Minimal downside, but huge potential upside as they learn from each mistake and gradually improve and create more exposure to the potential of a hit.<p>But in reality, it&#x27;s not the hits that Amazon counts on--it&#x27;s the recurring revenue of Prime and Unlimited subscriptions and loyalty around lots and lots of low-margin purchases. To keep those memberships coming, you don&#x27;t need to be a hit machine--you just need to keep offering incremental useful value, mediocre as it may be alone, to add value to the subscription.<p>I think that&#x27;s the angle. It&#x27;s not that Costco hot dogs are the best hot dogs in the industry for $1.50 (or $4.99 rotisserie chickens, or car buying services, etc.), it&#x27;s just that these items add enough value to enough peoples&#x27; Costco experience that they renew memberships and spend a lot of cash on low-margin stuff.",1415337251

8571282,comment,8563465,8569664,0,0,brickcap,,,"Good questions. Before I started building wrinq I surveyed landlords and tenants:-<p>1. Some of them flat out refused to use such a service. As you say the increase in costs was a detriment to them.<p>2. Some tenants said that it would be a very good idea and they would not mind paying higher rent if it meant that it was more convenient for them to pay.<p>Group #1 were people who had a family to support and increase in cost was significant. Group #2 were single persons with high salaries and 30-100 additional monthly cost meant nothing to them (this includes the fees of wrinq as well).<p>I also discovered a third group of people. Landlords who were willing to take in less rent if it meant that their tenants were happier. These people did not  keep tenants for profit but for company and maintenance of their properties (&quot;better than it being empty and gathering dust&quot;) so I will be targeting groups #2 and #3.<p>Also I think you can have a tremendous advantage if you look for landlords locally and offer them additional services. Like I have tied up with a few agents in my locality so when the existing tenants leave I am going to make sure that the landlords find new ones quickly without any difficulties. This way I promise new business to agents, good tenants to landlords and continuous income stream to myself.<p>Finally tie up with your local banks. Despite what most people think banks these days are quite open do business with individuals. They can offer you a proprietary api for a small upfront fees (and lot lesser transaction charges) which you can use to lower your charges. But don&#x27;t do this at first. This should be a last resort when you have exhausted other methods or if you want to grow your market to group #1.<p>Anyway don&#x27;t give up on the idea. Talk to people in your locality maybe you can discover some other ways that you can help them besides collecting rent.",1415337173

Everything else (including your startup) is trivial.<p>2) Even if you value your startup at 100% value (over family/friends/health/life), you&#x27;re incredibly short-sited and killing your own startup baby if you don&#x27;t have some balance in your life.  Startup life is NOT a sprint.  It&#x27;s a marathon.  To give the BEST to your startup, you need to bring your BEST every day.<p>Phrased another way, I often ask, &quot;Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re going to be interviewed on the Colbert Report, or other big-huge-friggin&#x27; deal tomorrow, what would you do today?&quot;  Often, people say, &quot;I&#x27;ll eat well, build something, hug my family, build something, help someone, build more, chat with a friend, take a walk, build more, play a game, go to bed early&quot;  So, if that&#x27;s what you do to bring your BEST tomorrow, then what would you do if you wanted to bring your BEST EVERY day?<p>That tends to drive home the message that work-life balance isn&#x27;t just helping your life, it&#x27;s truly what matters to helping your work too.<p>Corollary:  If you&#x27;re overstressed, you aren&#x27;t helping your work.  Often, overstressed people at startups will add much more friction in the small team, hurting efficiency as arguments & disrespect poisons the day&#x27;s actions.  Not to mention the zombie-brain mistakes in execution when you&#x27;re not taking proper care of yourself.",1415336711

When everyone in the world can contribute commands rather than a single team of software devs it is possible build up a much larger collection of them. I would really like the ability to add commands to a natural language command system when a command I use doesn&#x27;t work. Also, I think that a reprogramable command system would open up an interesting programming paradigm where one could define new commands and actions in terms of other commands in the system.

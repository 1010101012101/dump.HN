Yes, it seems they would.<p>You're asking us to know something that is impossible to know.  But, I've met Evan, I've read the story of Blogger, and I've heard him talk four or five times about his history with all of his companies.  I don't think I would ever bet against him, regardless of whether people take him seriously or not.<p>And, of course, Evan was <i>finished</i> with Blogger before he embarked on other things.  Twitter wasn't an old company that he revived after selling Blogger to Google.  It was something new.  He tried other things along the way, and when they failed or didn't succeed the way he'd hoped, he moved past them and tried something new.  He's practically a poster child for doing the opposite of what you're suggesting.",1240638298

578658,comment,577352,577890,0,0,whughes,,,"Eventually, yes, I'd say so. GeoCities had a good 10+ year run. USENET lasted 20 years or so until it was overrun. Perhaps Facebook and Twitter can beat these, but they will certainly be killed off at some point, considering the rapid changes happening these days.<p>The key is that it's not a sudden shutdown -- it's the result of a painful decline over the span of a few years. The same thing will probably happen with FB and Twitter, as they lose users to the new thing.",1240637280

In regards to twitter in specific, I believe that it will take quite a lot to dethrone the reigning king. Any new service will have to be compatible, incorporate and be a superset of twitter providing more functionality than the original without altering the simplicity.",1240637084
578653,comment,578520,578605,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Couldn't disagree more...how was it incoherent at all?  The comparison to me was this:<p>1. Visicalc reigned supreme.  They got all the press and had all the market share for their vertical (like Twitter today)<p>2. Visicalc got complacent and didn't really innovate (like Twitter today)<p>3. Someone else did it better and took over the market (he's betting that this will happen to Twitter)<p>I think his ""improvements"" to Twitter are debatable, but to be fair, he does make the point in the post that the specific improvements aren't what's crucial, just that users are going to demand innovation and Twitter hasn't really done much in that regard.",1240636984

578647,comment,577298,578564,0,0,gojomo,,,"It only makes outside companies a California taxpayer upon sales into California. That doesn't have to be confusing; it just makes cross-state sales more like in-state sales. In state retail sales were, for a century-plus, the norm. It's the special exemption for cross-state sales that has been arbitraged by online retailers. I don't blame them but it's not socially optimal.<p>I wish the 9th and 10th amendments were relevant; they were effectively nullified by the courts and congress long ago.<p>The problem is an unforeseen development -- massive cross-border retailing -- has created revenue holes for states and distorted incentives for consumers and businesses, advantaging out-of-state retailers and long shipments over local businesses. It's hard for individual states to fix, because there's an incentive for some states to defect, become islands of online/catalog retailers, and use the tax discontinuity to gain jobs by legal arbitrage -- not any true business-friendliness. (It's a bit like the competition for sports stadiums in that dimension -- it'd better if no jurisdictions offered giant subsidies, but once the bidding starts, it's hard not to match others' offers.)<p>Congress could solve using its power to regulate interstate congress; otherwise inefficiencies and unproductive gaming between the states will continue.",1240636505

Itâ€™s so much easier on eyes compared to my earlier iPhone reading sessions(> 20 minutes).  \nThere is indeed paucity of technical books from amazon for kindle. Publishers like Oreilly & pragmatic programmers are starting to offer kindle book editions.  But, pdf conversion process for Kindle works like a charm - was earlier a bit skeptical on this. I have tons of pdf book on my kindle now. \nI still use iPhone for reading browser-based content though, as Kindle browser support sucks.",1240635735

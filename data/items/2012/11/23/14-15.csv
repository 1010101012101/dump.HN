4822374,comment,4820781,4822087,2,0,peeters,,,"Planets outside of the solar system are not detected using light from the body itself.  They are detected by their gravitational pull on their host star (i.e. tides; causing a slight twinkle in the light emitted by the star), or a transit (eclipse) of the star (causing the star to become slightly dim for a period).  In both cases the telescope is looking at stars, and isn't fixated on one star but rather a field of stars, waiting for one to show activity.<p>Never mind the fact that even if we have a telescope that big, the issue is that these telescopes show a microscopically small field of view.  There's a whole sphere that would need to be observed, and repeatedly (since the bodies move).",1353682662

4822372,comment,4821928,4822330,2,0,w0utert,,,">> <i>Look at email as a standard - a few people have tried to extend that and it hasn't worked.</i><p>Bad example. E-mail is basically just formatted text with binary attachments to be interpreted by the e-mail client. Still, almost every e-mail client uses some internal database-like format to store your inbox and augment it with metadata to make it easily searchable and whatever. E-mail clients are to e-mail what music players like iTunes are to music files. You can't just pick up your Thunderbird e-mail database and drop it somewhere for Outlook to use, just like you can't pick up your iTunes library and drop it into Windows Media Player or whatever other music player. With some effort you can often import/export e-mail databases between clients, but that's no different from importing/exporting an iTunes library.<p>>> <i>Or, look at HTML as a standard. People want to extend that so they fight in a committee and collaborate until there's something which is mutually beneficial.</i><p>One of the most-heard complaints about the HTML standard is that it moves so freaking slow, and is still full of cruft and inconveniences from 20 years ago. HTML isn't actually that great at all, it's just the least worst option we have if you want cross-platform markup with all the features HTML offers today. That's not to say I propose a proprietary alternative to HTML by the way, just that HTML is hardly the prime example of a model you'd want to apply to every other piece of software.<p>>> <i>Or, look at USB. Literally a one-size-fits-all plug on both ends and a common transport layer - but you can stick whatever device you want on either end.</i><p>First of all that's not entirely true, because USB only defines a transport layer, not how the data going over the wire should be interpreted. It isn't all that different from something like RS-232 serial communication, just a lot more advanced. In itself there's nothing you can do with USB alone, you still need a protocol, which is usually implemented by a driver. Apart from generic hardware such as mass storage devices, almost any USB device that implements any kind of specialized hardware functions needs a hardware-specific driver, and more often than not, thesre are proprietary. Don't confuse 'open' with 'generic' by the way, because even if some piece of hardware uses an 'open' protocol, it's still not 'generic' as you can't do anything with it without a (very specific) driver. Second, USB is not really the epitome of 'openness' either, as you have to pay royalties to sell hardware that uses the USB standard and carries the USB logo.<p>Any more examples? ;-)",1353682576

Yes, improbable things happen, but our <i>beliefs</i> should be informed by whatever hypothesis is assigned the highest probability.<p>The difficulty that a hypothesis with very low prior probability (like this one) has is that in order for it to reach a level of probability necessary to compete with the more mundane explanations like dust or birds, it is going to have to be backed by very strong evidence. This is the Bayesian expression of ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"". The hypothesis needs to make some predictions that are exceptionally unlikely given those mundane hypotheses.<p>Unfortunately, it's difficult to see what predictions those might be. The authors of the paper don't give any, and their primary ""evidence"" for the hypothesis - that nobody else saw the object - is actually <i>more</i> likely given the birds/dust hypothesis than the comet hypothesis.<p>So yes, there's a tiny possibility that this could have been a comet, but if so, it's hard so imagine that it could ever be elevated to the point of a hypothesis that we should even take seriously, much less one that we should believe.",1353681399

Do you really propose that every piece of software in the world should be able to use every single bit of metadata ever used in any other random piece of software, on any other OS and any other device? Most of the iTunes metadata is in the ID3 tags, so it gets transferred. Not sure about ratings, but if they are not there it's probably because not all ID3 tag versions support it, or because different players interpret these fields differently. Anyway, tools exist to export this data from an iTunes library, nobody is stopping you from using them.<p>I don't really see how this is different from moving your music + ratings from Android to any other OS anyway.

The Java ecosystem is also so big that it takes years of experience to really get your head around it.  And don't get me started about C++.<p>Sure,  a decent coder can learn to write ""hello world"" in any of those languages,  but if you need to pick up a legacy system and understand what's wrong with it (I think this is 80% of the jobs) it takes depth.  If you've got enough depth in how systems work you can get sort-of up to speed in various languages quickly,  but there's no substitute for taking the time to know the details of what you're doing.<p>As for LOB work I can say that LOB systems can be a lot of fun to develop.  Your average e-commerce or social media site is basically an LOB system.  Developing a system of practices that lets you deliver LOB systems on time and under budget is a challenge,  but in the right environment it can be done and there is something very satisfying about delivering something that makes people's work easier.<p>The trouble with LOB work is that it's usually not greenfield work when it comes to you.

If technology can help at all, it'll probably be by creating solutions that address that question better.<p>Instead of better tools for distribution and discovery of old label music, it might be better to focus on the tools for creating new music, starting from composing/jamming to recording to releasing the music to listeners.<p>But, regardless of how good and effective such a technology may be, it will still boil down to the benevolence of the largest successful company that produces such technology.<p>For example, Amazon has done a great job of dragging books into the 21st century, but its evil colours are beginning to show. Going from paper books to ebooks is a bit like going from Encyclopedia Britannica to the Encarta CD-ROM, only worse because they can be remotely erased. I have high hopes for Wattpad to take us to the Wikipedia stage, but once they're there, who knows how evil they will turn out to be?<p>Similarly, someone may solve this problem for music temporarily with superior technology, but in the long run, it will come down to how greedy they are.",1353680097

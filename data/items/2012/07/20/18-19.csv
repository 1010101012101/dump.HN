Yes, I will explain.<p>Don't get me wrong, I absolutely <i>love</i> the Kickstarter concept. But in practice, their scaling seems to quickly be turning hem into a sales platform that has no controls or accountability.<p>And I have nothing bad to say about this project in particular, but they are a YC company, and the state of the prototype shows that they already have all they need to make it happen. This project doesn't need money. The campaign seems to me to be nothing more than a simple ""I'm making something cool, so give me cash"". And I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that -- by all means, people should be free to do what they wish with their money, and the Kickstarter campaign will probably work out beautifully for them. That's great.<p>But this whole perception of Kickstarter being a place for bootstrapping interesting projects is turning into a dangerous myth. Like many things before it, Kickstarter is becoming a place for people with money (and/or obvious ability to make money), to make even more money, though marketing under a vague guise of ""bootstrapping"", with no checks or balances to keep people honest.<p>This isn't an accusation leveled at Pixate -- I don't believe they're doing anything wrong and I have huge faith in YC's filtering. But once enough clever people figure out that you can earn a killing or huge bonus on top of <i>anything</i>, just by tacking on a nice Kickstarter campaign, it will become impossible to separate the wheat from the chaff. And then people will move on to the next thing, and the cycle will repeat.<p></bubble-y doomsaying>",1342809784

When they come up with a cure for dyslexia, I'll be sure to get it. In the meantime, I suspect that most people are just dyslexic enough (dyslexia is a spectrum) that these little things cause them a great deal of trouble.

That's no doubt, in part, why I became a programmer.<p>As to throwing you off, since this mistake is so common, it would seem to be easy enough to train yourself to treat the two words as hominyms of each other. After all, you have no problem, I take it, with all the other homonyms in the language. (Yeah, I know, wheelchair ramps <i>are</i> annoying!)

You have to be a better than average programmer, one who has worked with multiple languages from multiple paradigms, who has worked with real production code before, to recognize why it is so much superior to any other programming language currently available right now.<p>I'm GLAD that there is currently no killer app for Clojure, like how Rails became the killer app for Ruby. IMO Rails killed Ruby. Ruby started out in the right direction but once Rails became popular there was an influx of so-so programmers who started polluting the language with inefficient concepts, constantly reinventing the wheel poorly because they did not know enough computer science to know that a better solution had already been invented. Now the system has been bogged down by so much cruft, it is difficult to see if it still serves the purpose it was originally designed for (a language the people can enjoy programming in).<p>Clojure is not ready yet. The core team is still working on refining the fundamentals for what maybe can become the 100 year language [<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/hundred.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/hundred.html</a>] -- look at reducers in 1.4. Right now Clojure doesn't need more people. It needs more smart people. If you are not smart enough to understand why it is worth switching to it, maybe you should wait a bit and let the design mature more. The killer apps will come. Clojure's ability to scale complexity will eventually overcome its current drawbacks, as the tools and the ecosystem matures.",1342808997

Can we get the, say, 10 million Java developers to sit still long enough for that?  No, probably not.  Maybe a tenth of them eventually, maybe.  And, if a bunch of them head over to Scala because they like the look of {{{}}} instead of ((())), so be it.<p>A more interesting question to me lately is, what is the objective of language evangelism?  Let's set aside any notion that Clojure will be ""the next Java"", or even achieve the same penetration as Python or Ruby.  For those of us that use the language, none of those goals are particularly important.  ""How many developers use language X"" used to be a critical question when the language you used largely delimited the reach of your eventual application/system/whatever; that is hardly the case anymore.  I can write my server side in <i>literally</i> anything, and transpiling to JavaScript or C for client side as necessary is either within reach, or a solved problem depending on your preferred language.<p>So, what should be the objective?  Having a large enough pool of talent to meet business objectives is the only thing I can think of that is an actual potential blocker.  I know lots of people that know Clojure that would like to <i>work</i> in Clojure, and there are more people like that every day.  Seems like the vector is trending positive; we only need to make sure it stays that way.<p>(This leaves out the enterprise guys to a certain degree, but that's largely due only to their [and their managers'] self-inflicted risk profile.)<p>Finally, I leave you with this:<p><a href=""http://www.indeed.com/jobanalytics/jobtrends?q=clojure%2Chaskell%2CF%23%2Cocaml&l="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indeed.com/jobanalytics/jobtrends?q=clojure%2Chas...</a><p>Note that those are absolute trendlines, not growth.

(1) the court finds that the defendant did not do anything that is covered by any of the valid patent claims. (2) the court finds that the patent should not have issued in the first place, due to a problem such as prior art making it not non-obvious, the patentee not being the inventor, and so on.<p>Knowing this is important because it determines who this case affects those who are not Kaspersky. If Kaspersky won because they simply did not do anything that is covered by the patent, but the patent is valid, then everyone else still has to worry about that patent.<p>If Kaspersky won because the court found that the patent is invalid, then we can all scratch this patent off our lists of patents we have to worry about.<p>(And all of this, of course, depends on what happens in the appeals court if the plaintiff appeals).",1342808685

The reasoning is that technology is advancing to the point where its less and less of a 'big deal.' The last remaining hurdle is 'on-orbit refueling'.<p>Today, the last remaining challenge of landing on the moon, is carrying enough fuel for a trans-lunar injection orbit into orbit, and then for the lander to land on the moon itself.<p>With modern launch vehicles, it is straight-forward to launch a moon landing mission as three components (command module, lander, and engine/fuel. And link them together in orbit. However, there is a significant penalty to not launching all at once into the correct earth orbit to later elongate into a trans lunar orbit. So a 'modern' mission actually would need <i>two</i> loads of fuel in orbit, one to move the whole assembly into a prepatory orbit, and then one to move from that orbit to the moon.<p>If we have on-orbit refueling then you manage a depot of fuel for the second step, and the sequence becomes launch lander, dock it with a tug. Launch command module, attach that to the tug. Move the tug (with its command and lander modules) into the same ecliptic as the moon's orbit. Then refuel, and <i>then</i> use the tug to move you to the moon.<p>By re-using the tug multiple times the costs drop dramatically. (like $100M every time you re-use it, that is a tug you didn't launch from earth).<p>People want on-orbit refueling so that we can have longer lived satellites. (there are perfectly serviceable communication satellites in 'dead' orbits because they no longer have the fuel for station keeping.)<p>Once we get that capability it won't be a question of 'will' to get to the moon, it will simply be a question of money. And there is enough disposable income amongst the young billionaires of the world that getting the money won't be an issue either.",1342807623

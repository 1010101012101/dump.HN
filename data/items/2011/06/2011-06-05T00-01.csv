I studied at a university in the US and I hold an Indian passport. I travelled in and out of the country multiple times, but not once was I asked questions like ""Are you a terrorist?"". I was only held by the officials once at immigration for 20 minutes. This was when I transferred from one university to another (You don't need to re-apply for a visa for this which is why it leads to some confusion cause you are not going to the university mentioned on the visa).<p>I never felt like anyone was trying to trick me, or insult me, or ever asked me questions like those above.<p>Do they treat students differently?

I started applying them and found the quality (and maintainability, reusability, etc) of my code increase tremendously.<p>Careful with that. The purpose of design patterns is to give a name to something you already do, not to find new things that do that aren't needed (<i>cough</i> Spring Framework, J2EE). I am sure you aren't doing that, just wanted to make sure the messaging is more clear.<p>The Design Patterns Book didn't initially help me when I started programming. However, after working on several substantial Java, C++ and Perl projects I've picked it up and again and was able to identify what I've done and what the standard libraries I use do: ""oh, java.util.HashSet is an adaptor bridge from from a hashtable data structure to the Set interface"" or ""boost::graph uses visitors to implement multiple dispatch based on different edge/vertex types"". Now, I'll often make sure to use standard design patterns for my APIs when possible (e.g., Iterator interface, rather than accepting an anonymous classes/function objects if all I want to do let them lazily stream data one at a time).",1307234886

2620904,comment,2574132,2574132,1,0,antiscam,,,"It's a huge myth that Bitcoin is beyond the reach of governments. There are three reasons for this.<p>First, Bitcoin isn't actually decentralized. It's not a true open-source community of developers; the core group is tiny, and few others are knowledgeable about the protocol, which is poorly documented. Remove the mainline client and you'd destroy Bitcoin. The exchanges are hugely centralized. Exceedingly few people use Bitcoin for anything else other than buying and selling dollars, and there's only one place to do that in any volume - an unregulated Japanese exchange of questionable legality.<p>Second, Bitcoin is extremely vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, both network-based (even the original developers were aware of this) and as a result of the higher-level Bitcoin protocol itself. The best analyst on these matters, someone using the label ""ComputerScientist"" at, among other places, Ben Laurie's blog (links.org) estimated that it would cost less than $1 million to topple the system without even any cleverness - just by obtaining a majority of the ""legitimate"" hashing power of the network.<p>Third, though this is more speculative, most people don't like to engage in financial crime; it's not psychologically the same thing as downloading a CD or a television show. Nobody thinks they're supporting significantly illicit activity by downloading some music that otherwise would have cost them $7. People can be easily persuaded -- rightly -- that they're supporting money laundering, significantly illegal and immoral purchases, and so on using Bitcoin. Indeed, because Bitcoin is essentially unneeded for legitimate transactions (and probably can't compete in the long term on transaction fees with other legitimate payments systems), its primary use aside from speculation is currently illegal activity, and there's no reason to think that will change.",1307234875

In the social realm, thats really the key. Social networks like LinkedIn, FaceBook and Twitter increase their value with each additional user. Telephones are also a classic example of the network effect. Groupon does not become more useful to me the more users it has. Possibly, it becomes more useful to merchants but from the merchant's I've discussed this with, other sites simply offer them better terms and, therefore, more profit.<p>Personally, I think sunchild had a great point by addressing that the artificial scarcity is gone. Myself, and my peers, have now reverted to buying these deals on-demand. If I want a massage deal, I head over to YipIt (an aggregator) and do a quick search. I don't waste my time reading their emails.<p>SwellJoe and GentleBen also addressed the same issue: lack of loyalty.

If I had to work a job that didn't involve programming, I'd still do it after work (I've played an amazing 3d game that as written by somebody who worked a summer job at a gas station). I regularly program outside of work, I've stayed at work for long hours. When I'd have a day with multiple meetings, I'd frequently stay late to write code as otherwise I'd feel unsatisfied.<p>At the mean time, some days I'd prefer to have dinner with my girlfriend after work. On weekends I'd occasionally prefer a get away outside of Silicon Valley. Exercise is an absolute must. I also have interest outside of computing: reading (history, philosophy), photography. Pursuing them only helps re-invigorate my passion for computing: occasionally ideas would come to me when I'm reading an unrelated book, working out at the gym or taking photographs.<p>Many times there's a direct link: I'd write my own photo gallery software and host the pictures myself, build creative ways to backup my images, research ways to do interesting image manipulation from Linux (photo manipulation libraries, etc...) etc... Pursuing photography as a hobby while on a budget as a college student meant I had to do ""casual programming"" quite frequently to get what I want done (now, however, I've shelled out for Aperture).<p>It's important to understand that performance requires maintenance, good ideas come form outside. At the mean time, there's nothing wrong with working long hours if you want to do so: it's only healthy and pleasant if you actually have a passion for what you do (as long as you don't go to the extreme of forgoing maintenance and ignoring other sources of inspiration).",1307234477

If you consider the ratio of expertise to ignorant questions you'll see that this is really bad advice. Experts, even when they dabble in Q&A, are not by definition tutors. It's unfair to expect that whole category of people to waste their own time and the time of people with smart questions by 'coddling' those who fail to grasp this fact. When dealing with people who are clearly overreaching their current capabilities, or who ask 'how' questions without any interest in the 'why', giving them the cold shoulder and an invitation to gather more background knowledge from published resources is often the best service that can be done.<p>Another factor in support fatigue among open source software experts is the (often inept) commercial application of the software, which is commonly associated with a lack of respect for the software itself and for those who have deep knowledge of it. Then* you get questions paired with criticism like 'I know exactly how to do this in Y, why can't stupid X behave the way I want?' or insistent pleading like 'I need to get this working ASAP! Please halp!'. When the intent behind the question is not to learn but to make money faster, volunteers support 'staff' are not obliged to step up.<p>Anyway, advising experts in general to change the way they volunteer time and information is pointless. They know what works for them and there are no levers on IRC to make them change their habits.<p>PS, config help on #apache? What network is that? :)<p>* I know, not only then.",1307232481

I was floored. I started applying them and found the quality (and maintainability, reusability, etc) of my code increase tremendously.<p>Over time, others have given me more tips on improving my efficiency.

I still write some code, but while my value as a developer has dropped tremendously, my value in managing a team of developers means our overall output is greater than the sum of our parts.<p>In other words, I increased my ""value"" by becoming a manager.

Sometimes it's only realistically possible to do X units of work a day (let's say 10 units), and sometimes a person is asked to do Y units of work a day (let's say 30). That means 20 units aren't going to get done; it's just not possible. Trying to squeeze in more would result in a lack of quality (due to lack of sleep, exhaustion, etc). So what can one do? Do the most important 10 units first. It sounds pretty obvious, but in the heat of the moment, I sometimes found myself wanting to do the 10 easiest units first, not the 10 most important. Proper prioritization made a big increase in the quality of my output as well.",1307232346

They are clearly related though.<p>Another hypothesis is that working memory and fluid intelligence both utilize the same neural paths/network, so an increase in one benefits the other.<p>The study itself is linked in my article above if you're interested in reading it.  It's pretty interesting stuff.",1307232309

If you're going to use a service, use Indeed, Authentic Jobs, the 37 Signals job board or something else. ""Inside Startups"" is a great newsletter that lists jobs weekly.<p>Ideally, though, you want to meet people in person. There are multiple parties, events, and meetups every week.<p>To start, go to any of the tech meetups listed on Meetup.com. Garysguide.org has a lot of events listed as well. (Those Meetup groups have email lists, watch them for job postings.) Get business cards and follow up with people.<p>You're going to get offers faster than you expect. Decide what you want (big company, small company, front-end, back-end, python, ruby, etc), and learn to say ""no"". Before saying ""yes"", ask other nerds about them (at the Meetups, for example).",1307232268

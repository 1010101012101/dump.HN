From <i>Born on a Blue Day</i>:<p>> I never write anything down when I&#x27;m calculating, because I&#x27;ve always been able to do the sums in my head and it&#x27;s much easier for me to visualise the answer using my synaesthetic shapes than to try to follow the `carry the one&#x27; techniques taught in textbooks we are given at school. When multiplying, I see the two numbers as distinct shapes. This image changes and a third shape emerges --- the correct answer. The process takes a matter of seconds and happens spontaneously. It&#x27;s like doing maths without having to think.<p>> [...] I&#x27;m multiplying 53 by 131. I see both numbers as a unique shape and locate each spatially opposite the other. The space created between the two shapes creates a third, which I perceive as a new number: 6943, the solution to the sum. [sic]",1436684367

What we <i>are</i> suggesting is that his opinion is wrong, and should be excluded from American foreign policy, because when you remove the lens of privilege, drone assassinations stop looking like a good thing.<p>&quot;I oppose welfare because if those poor people weren&#x27;t lazy, they would have jobs&quot; is a reasonable thing to say when the only world you know is one where your parents&#x27; friends offer you jobs and internships at dinner parties. This comes from a position of privilege: unemployment predominantly affects people of color in poor inner-city communities where people do not have such social networks, have in been deliberately excluded from those social networks, in a world where having a Black-sounding name on your resume makes you many times less likely to get the interview. (It is entirely possible to rationally oppose welfare on other grounds: poor incentive structures, support for alternatives like public works projects instead, ideological commitment to the free market, etc. But specifically the claim that poverty is a personal failure of character, unambiguously comes from privilege and is therefore not correct.)<p>When someone makes this argument and we call them privileged, we aren&#x27;t asking for them to get laid off, we&#x27;re arguing that their idea of social policy is immoral and people who believe it ought not to be voted into positions of control over government budgets.<p>tl;dr: privilege isn&#x27;t why you&#x27;re evil, but it is why your opinion is wrong",1436683885

9872726,comment,9872020,9872020,0,0,curiousjorge,,,"This has <i>huge</i> potential. I just saw the tutorial video and super excited. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of this before, this could be the &#x27;missing&#x27; piece of the front-end application puzzle. What I mean by that is that there are so much fragmentation in this landscape and a tool like this could eventually consolidate all the heterogeneous attempts by forcing others to adopt the same UI builder, and compete on that front.<p>The tool is shockingly reminiscent of early 2000s, where anyone could make software using VB. Recall that VB had everything done under the sun, somebody had built a component on VB, you could use that or you could hack it for your need. Another example is Google&#x27;s Java Swing UI builder (as horrible Swing is), allowing data binding with the form. These never caught on but we now have this technology in the browser. Whoever owns the UI builder tool market will emerge as the victor, Facebook should hire you immediately.<p>There are several appealing points about the React UI builder which I think will help me:<p>- WYSIWYG editor to drop bootstrap component allows me to easily build from my mockup wireframes and save me from typing everything out.<p>- ability to edit the code directly for each component. Would be nice if I double clicked a button it would create a click event (just like visual studios or netbeans)<p>- ability to use html directly in the code (okay, feature of react which is a bit controversial but for me it definitely beats using + everywhere)<p>- generates clean, easy to understand plumbing code (this is what I spent a lot of time on when I used to build my swing tool <a href=""https://github.com/jjk3/scrape-it-screen-scraper"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jjk3/scrape-it-screen-scraper</a>)<p>I been putting off learning react.js,flux and such but this actually entices me to use it for my next project (<a href=""https://github.com/whatsdis/hedgehog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/whatsdis/hedgehog</a>).

10152695,comment,10152354,10152354,0,0,s_q_b,,,"Alright, this headline just seems wrong.<p>First, radiocarbon dating comes with error bars. The date range identified is from 570 C.E. to 632 C.E. Given that Muhammad is thought to have founded Islam in the period from 610 C.E. to 630 C.E., and that date keeping was relatively good in this period, this would seem to confirm rather than dispute the traditional accounts.<p>Second, the radiocarbon dating was performed on the parchment only, not the ink, as the article belatedly notes. Given the practice of ancient scribes to re-use parchment repeatedly, a rather unfortunate practice that has resulted in the loss of uncountable ancient texts, the age of the writing would be controlling, not the age of the parchment.<p>Third, I&#x27;m forced to draw a rather unfortunate conclusion from this information. The assertion in this article seems deliberately calculated to undermine the historicity of Islam. There is a very sad and shortsighted movement in some corners of military scholarship right now that identifies Islam itself as the enemy, often beginning with Huntington&#x27;s &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; narrative and ending with some examples of sheer lunacy, such as the recent article by a West Point associate professor arguing that legal human rights scholars are &quot;an Islamist fifth column.&quot;<p>Islam is one of the world&#x27;s great religions, and like all religions it inspires everything from massive works of charity to zealotry, persecution, and bigotry. I have known many good people who drew their strength from Islam, and condemning an entire religion is a type of insanity that is directly contrary to the founding principles of the United States.<p>Islam is not the enemy. Those who would pervert it for their own violent ends are. We cannot lose that distinction.",1441118953

In fact, it&#x27;s almost certainly <i>better</i>.<p>All else being equal, the total loss to the economy when a doomed company goes under is the same.  If $50m was invested, that $50m has been lost, almost always with nothing at all to show for it.  Of course, if no debt was involved, that money didn&#x27;t go away, it just went somewhere else.  Most likely, since it was paid out as wages, that somewhere else was China.<p>The ability to sell a worthless security at a loss as opposed to holding it until it is eventually canceled when the corporation is wound down does not change this.  All it does is spread the loss out: the first investor loses whatever he put in less what he gets for the stock later, and whoever buys it at that point eats the rest of the loss (or at least until she sells it at a loss too, and so on).  The total loss doesn&#x27;t change; all that changes is the distribution of losses across the economy.<p>However, it&#x27;s not that simple.  An IPO invariably entails the issuance of shares that did not exist previously.  That is, some portion of the raise is new investment.  When the company fails, all investment made in it is lost, so any additional investment increases the total loss to the economy.  So the world actually becomes poorer when a company is able to go public before failing (or, more broadly, each additional round of funding whether public or private increases the total loss).  The longer a bubble is allowed to inflate, the greater the total loss to malinvestment.<p>So, is it better for 225k &quot;qualified&quot; investors to eat the entire loss, or for several million retail investors to share in a somewhat larger loss?  Your answer probably depends on which you are.  Overall, though, all that matters is how much total investment was made in companies that fail without ever paying a dividend.",1441118798

Having tinkered with LXC and Docker I felt instantly at home with LXC. Docker frankly got me very frustrated. (Again, not looking for debate here, just background info about me.)<p>Why I&#x27;m asking: I&#x27;m drafting a technical plan for a web-app I want to write. While I&#x27;ve considered a monolithic website to service all customers, I&#x27;m increasingly drawn to giving each customer a separate instance of the app in their own container. This would help achieve separation of customers (in case one does something nasty and consumes all disk space, or thrashes the CPU into the ground). I&#x27;m also hoping one day to allow new customers to instantly access a brand-new instance of my app. The customer pays online, a new container is provisioned and app deployed inside it (guess I&#x27;ll have to work on that part), and the hosting provider increases my bill by £X.Yp per month.<p>Customers will be (very) small businesses of 2-20 people. The web-app will offer basic management of rooms, equipment, staff. Traffic and processor/RAM demand is likely to be minimal.<p>Many thanks.<p>[0] https://www.andreas-jung.com/contents/the-case-against-docker<p>[1] https://blog.abevoelker.com/why-i-dont-use-docker-much-anymore/",1441118090

I&#x27;ll mention two that I haven&#x27;t seen being pointed out elsewhere in this discussion. I hope they are of interest.<p>1. The article states:<p><pre><code>    ... and found that most were white, male, and highly 
    educated. “If one does not have money in the form of a 
    family with money, the chances of becoming an 
    entrepreneur drop quite a bit,” Levine tells Quartz.
</code></pre>
Given that the daughters of rich families are just as well-off and educated as the sons, and have as much access to parental/familial capital, having a wealthy family background cannot be the whole story. We can have long discussions about why this is, but the key point is that this disparity really undermines the article, regardless of cause.<p>2. The article doesn&#x27;t reflect on the what exactly entrepreneurship is. One could argue that poor people in the developing world are much more entrepreneurial because most of them are in some form or other self-employed, ie. are entrepreneurs: the cigarette and waterbottle seller on the street corner, the coconut seller on the beach, the fisherman fishing with his own boat and net, the garbage picker who sells empty plastic bottles by the kilo for recyling ... They often are not employed. In a sense it&#x27;s poverty that forces them into Entrepreneurship. It&#x27;s the absence of large structured firms with the stability of employment that provide that&#x27;s missing. By cherrypicking specific forms of glamorous entrepreneurs, they arrive at a skewed conclusion that more careful analysis would undermine.",1441118061

If your production configuration is stored as static-file in version control, then either those credentials have to live in that version control, or they have to live outside it, as a separately-backed up file of configuration variables, which are then fed to a static-file-generating tool, which means a) that one has to select a templating system and maintain those separate templates and b) that there&#x27;s another step involved in developing the prototypes for those templates.

You will find if you look at the rate at which corpses lose heat to ambient temperature that it is very, very close to what is listed on those base metabolic rate charts.<p>Do you happen to know a typical range for this?   For caloric maintenance level, there is:<p>* Body temperature maintenance  
* Operating bodily functions (pumping blood, breathing, etc)  
* Basic &quot;non-exercise&quot; movements<p>For all of these, calories consumed (eaten) must take into consideration:<p>* caloric extraction (basically, net of calories remaining in excrement)    
* caloric consumption efficiency (of those retained, how efficiently are they converted into heat & kinetic energy)<p>There are actually two sets of numbers for the first three points: actual literal calories required, and then the set that takes into account the last two points.  How different are these numbers?  I wonder, assuming this &quot;weight plateau&quot; while still in <i>what is thought to be</i> caloric deficit is actually real, could the general understanding of the last two points not be correct in all situations?<p>As discussed, it seems some people extract more calories from the same food (for whatever reason), although how true is that?  The other alternative is that they have similar bodily behavior as someone with a thyroid problem (calories are uptaken (I think?) but not stored as fat - not sure how this works then, are they excreted?), but if on a strict diet, the body could change causing a plateau.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m doing a very good job of explaining myself.",1441117509

They escaped Genocide and other horrors.<p>When they got here they grabbed whatever job they could.  They had nothing.  They saved their money.  And when they could, they started their own small businesses (yes, both of my grandparents behaved the same way without knowing each other).<p>No, there was no IPO.  These were small neighborhood stores.  One was a little general store and the other was a shoe repair store.  Yet, they had their own businesses and were able to support their family through their own efforts.<p>My parents, in turn, followed a similar path.  No, they were not handed money.  They worked at my grandparent&#x27;s stores and learned an entrepreneurial work ethic.  As they got older they got jobs working elsewhere, my mom as a clothing designer at a factory and my dad as a salesman at an insurance company.<p>Years later, after saving every penny they made, they decided to launch their own business, a clothing manufacturing business.  My childhood memories are filled with moments in this little shop with both my mom and dad slaving away behind industrial sewing machines.  Yes, the &quot;factory&quot; was mom and dad for the first year or two in a little 500 square foot industrial unit.  Today we might call that a &quot;minimum viable product&quot;.  Yet the idea was that they where all-in, quit their jobs, found a contract somewhere and did whatever was necessary to deliver, make money and grow.  My parents were no strangers to sixteen hour days behind industrial sewing machines while the kids did homework, played and slept in the background.<p>Of course, through hard work and pure grit they eventually grew out of there and, years later, found themselves running a shop that was about 50,000 square feet, with two or three dozen employees and dozens of machines of all kinds.  I, as a kid, loved spending time at the factory messing around with stuff.  I eventually learned enough about the machinery that, as a young teenager, I could fix the machines better than my dad or the technicians he would hire from time to time.  And yes, I also learned to sew and worked the various machines from time to time.  In the weekends my dad and I would go to the factory and prepare work for the coming week.<p>The work ethic was strong.  We worked.  And, no, we were not millionaires.  Yes, my parents did well but the clothing industry was disintegrating slowly and they were very aware of this.  Also, I think my parents worked so hard that they really didn&#x27;t have time to develop strategies.  Years later the factory had to be shut down due to the impossibility of competing with cheap Chinese imported goods.  Dozens of good people lost their jobs and my parents went back to work for others.  Funny enough, my mom went to work designing clothes and my dad went back to insurance.  Exactly where they started when they were young.<p>Throughout this I never heard them complain about a thing.  They did whatever had to be done to take care of the family.  I think those were different times.  People were tougher.  There was real grit out there.  Particularly from immigrants or first generation children.  Compared to then, today&#x27;s population seems neutered.  Crying foul at the dumbest things.  Filing for disability if they pull a muscle.  Such bullshit.  Such wasted human potential.  I watched my parents and grandparents work no matter what.  In fact, I can&#x27;t even remember any of them ever staying home sick.  Hero&#x27;s, in the true sense of the word, at least as it pertains to the families they took care of.<p>When I got older I followed a similar path.  I got nothing from my family other than this insane drive to do whatever was necessary to succeed.  My first job was washing dishes at one of those companies that delivered food to airplanes (back in the day when they gave you real plates and silverware).  I didn&#x27;t last long because I had other goals in mind.  I quit that and got a job at a professional photography lab and studio.  I went to school at night while I held down that job.  I actually started to function in an entrepreneurial way as I started to do some professional photo work during that time.  It was fun work for a young 19 year old because I was going out to do photo shoots with stunningly beautiful models who I later became friends with.  It was an interesting time.<p>As my school work in electrical engineering got past the basic requirements and got more into engineering I felt I needed to get a proper engineering job.  And that I did.  I worked at a company that made industrial robots, did some basic design work and helped with support and maintenance.<p>I saved as much money as I could.  I stayed there nine years.  And, yes, I did little entrepreneurial things here and there but nothing major.  Nine years later I felt I was ready to launch my own business.  And I did.  It was a moderate success.  I launched another and then another.  I have done very well, I&#x27;ve gone bankrupt, recovered and have done well again.  The basic formula is to be fiscally responsible, patient, save money and be willing to work hard and smart as needed.  Success isn&#x27;t given, it is earned.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt there are many who are handed tens, hundreds or millions of dollars by their families to start businesses and play &quot;entrepreneur&quot;.  Those people do exist.  And quite a few fail and never try again (or keep burning cash) because they are what I called &quot;neutered&quot; in terms of the grit required to be an entrepreneur.<p>The fallacy in an article such as the one posted is that money isn&#x27;t the magical pixie dust that makes an entrepreneur or make him or her successful.  No, the pixie dust has nothing whatsoever to do with money.  Money is a tool.  The pixie dust is a combination of many things, including smarts, timing, frugality, boldness, grit, determination, no fear of failure, the ability to get back up when knocked down and more.<p>You don&#x27;t need to come from a privileged home to learn these things.  A mom holding down three jobs to provide for the family is as much of a positive role model as my parents were.  She can teach the kids lots of lessons they will never forget.  What does not lead to entrepreneurship is a neutered existence where people are afraid of their own shadows, don&#x27;t take risks, want the government to provide everything and become dependent on mysterious external magic to survive.  This is how a lot of people freak out when the power goes out while others see it as an opportunity to do something else with the kids (and entrepreneurs try to figure out what product to come up with to address the problem).<p>In entrepreneurship money makes things easier if and only if the entrepreneurial foundation is there to begin with.  That&#x27;s why shops like YC need multi-founder teams and, even at that, they have to become their virtual parents and role models in order to ensure success and teach them the culture and ways of entrepreneurship.  Young single founders without this &quot;grit&quot; would crumble inside of a year, money or not.<p>I would venture to say that the millions of small business entrepreneurs out there do not come from wealthy families.  I don&#x27;t have any data to back this up but it is simply impossible to think that my local ice cream shop, cleaner&#x27;s, barber shop, AC guy, gardener, etc. fell into their businesses because they got some money from mom and dad.  I think the opposite is far more likely to be true.  They worked their asses off, saved some money and launched.",1441116715

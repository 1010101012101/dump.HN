The GP noted indeed why we should expect the distribution of suitably scaled sample means to converge to the Fourier transform of e^(-x^2/2). I&#x27;m saying, it doesn&#x27;t seem essential to the existence of a CLT type result that this Fourier transform is e^(-x^2/2) itself [i.e., it doesn&#x27;t seem essential that e^(-x^2/2) happens to be a fixed point of the Fourier transform]; if the Fourier transform of e^(-x^2/2) were some other function, we&#x27;d still speak of a Central Limit Theorem and the privileged role of that other function instead.

9041902,comment,9039235,9041685,0,0,nhaehnle,,,"Well, there is a &quot;most likely&quot; there ;)<p>But yes, I highly suspect that technology will never reach a point where multi-layer cores make sense. Part of the reasoning is that even if you reduce distances, you&#x27;re still fighting with transistor switching speed, and individual cores are already very small. I do believe that designs with cores on one slice and L3 cache on another slice may happen, by the way. Another part of the reasoning is that (even if manufacturing can largely avoid the multiple-slice-then-glue method), the density of inter-layer connections will likely be much lower than the wiring density on the lower metal interconnect layers [0], which makes it unattractive to have closely tied logic spread across different layers. There are theoretical academic papers talking about the physical design of e.g. adders spread across a small number of layers, but they&#x27;re frankly not very impressive, and their assumptions about the electrical properties of the inter-layer connections appear a bit on the optimistic side (understandable because hey, you&#x27;ve got to publish something!).<p>Overall, it&#x27;s just a big headache, compared to the alternative of going 3D by stacking relatively large logical components such as cores and cache blocks.<p>[0] To be fair, I haven&#x27;t seen numbers on this. I don&#x27;t know how familiar you are with the typical stacks of interconnect metal, which consist of a very small number of layers for the thinnest wires, and then additional layers of increasingly (order of magnitude) larger wires for longer distance connections. In a hypothetical multi-transistor-layer design, how do you arrange those interconnect layers? To have a high density of connections between the layers, you want to only use layers with thin wires between the transistor layers, but then it&#x27;s unclear how the longer distance wiring should work.<p>Edit: Let me formulate my position as a more concrete prediction. There will never be a major commercial microprocessor in whose design an automated tool is used to decide the assignment of a significant fraction[1] of transistors to their layer on an individual basis[2].<p>[1] Meaning a significant fraction of the random logic transistors; with growing caches, the fraction of transistors which is placed by an automatic tool is decreasing anyway.<p>[2] Meaning that the tool makes individual decisions about fundamental building blocks such as NAND gates. It is slightly more conceivable that an automatic tool is used to assign larger blocks (such as an FPU) to different layers. I would still predict that this won&#x27;t happen, but with lower confidence.",1423781644

By passing to a limit, you remove the higher moments from consideration, and isolate on the second-order behavior of the solution near the origin (in characteristic function coordinates).  Only the second-order behavior matters, and the Gaussian is <i>the</i> distribution that has a characteristic function with a quadratic behavior at the origin (in the exponent).<p>The real structure of the problem is that it assumes independence, or a similar condition (like mixing) strong enough to mimic independence.  Independence is what allows you to pass to the limit and thereby focus on the second-order behavior around the origin.<p>And in practice, you have just swept the bump under the rug, because you now have to justify your independence assumption -- and that&#x27;s hard.<p>My quibble is with the side comment about the Gaussian being its own Fourier transform.  This property is required (i.e., the Gaussian must be a fixed point of the CLT), but the property does not provide any constraint on the class of possible solutions of the CLT.<p>In fact, there is an infinite number of functions that transform into themselves.  I can easily construct a new one from any Fourier-transformable function you give me.  For example, I can make such a function that looks like a square wave with some wiggles in it.

Please skip down to:<p>&#x27;Daddy&#x27;s job in video games was no longer a cool thing they liked to brag about&#x27;<p>That is a story that everyone should read. It is emotionally intense, and I think it says a lot about the difficulties that families face due to the instability in some industries, notably the video game industry.<p>I&#x27;m posting some of it here. I&#x27;m struck by how much the family tried to roll with the punches, but the punches just kept coming:<p>-----------------------------<p>We found some possibilities and, after interviewing, he received a great offer from a wonderful and stable company, in a state where we already had friends and family. We purchased a home and relocated our (now) family of six, leaving California for good. This was a really exciting move for us. Each child had their own room (they had to share in California), and they could paint or decorate their rooms however they liked. Our in-laws were in a position to buy a second home in the area, so they could be closer to the grandchildren. It was a ranch, and the kids loved to explore it. Life was looking very good, and we were all very excited about the future.21<p>The following summer was when we experienced our first layoff. It was devastating and extremely scary. My income wasn&#x27;t enough to cover the mortgage, even with the unemployment. We received no severance, and our health benefits would run out at the end of the month.<p>We tried applying for positions at numerous gaming companies (and non-gaming companies) in the area, but no one was looking for my husband&#x27;s skillset at that time (in addition to there being a mass layoff and the market being flooded with great talent of all levels). In the end, we were forced to relocate. We chose a studio that had been around for many years and had survived through releases of games both good and bad. We had friends in that area, and the entire situation looked like a pretty good fit for us.<p>We continued paying for the house while it was on the market, and we were once again put up in temporary housing. This time, the six of us had to stay in a hotel for a month, until an apartment that would fit us all became available. Once we moved into the temporary apartment, it was time for the children to start school again. We registered them knowing they would only be in the school for a month or so, and then they would move to a more permanent school once we found our own apartment to rent.<p>This time, our stay in temporary housing was extended due to the amount of overtime my husband had to work, and we were not able to transfer the children to their new school until they were between semesters. As was inevitable, they had begun making friendships and establishing roots, even though they knew they wouldn&#x27;t be staying. It wasn&#x27;t easy for them, but we had prepared them well from the start, and they knew they could keep in contact with their friends and maintain those friendships if they wanted to. I think that made it a little bit easier on them.<p>After we were settled and a couple of years had passed, I received notice that my appeal for in-state tuition was being granted and that I was able to register for classes at the local college. My son had been very sick for the past few months, and our family pediatrician told us that he felt our next step was surgery. He said it was probably best to do it sooner rather than later. We got him scheduled and started preparing for it. My husband requested some time off so he could be there. It was approved and we were all set.",1423779859

For a little while pinterest had gigantic packet loss problems that were due to over sharding of images.<p>The really annoying thing is that the &quot;right amount of sharding&quot; has to do with available bandwidth, the size of the resources being sent, and the latency between client and server..

A company has every right to not offer a bug bounty, and to fully prosecute you for trying to find a vulnerability (you can quibble about what &quot;trying to find a vulnerability&quot; means, but they have the right, like it or not). You have no right to demand payment for a perceived vulnerability in a company&#x27;s infrastructure, <i>even</i> if they have a bug bounty program.<p>The most serious vulnerabilities I ever found (read: the greatest potential for exploitation) came from reports to companies without bug bounties, so I know the position you&#x27;re in. But looking for payment in return for vulnerabilities outside of the context of a bug bounty sets a precedent for the wrong motivation and is inherently adversarial to the company. Do <i>not</i> fish for vulnerabilities, then try to hold out your report for payment. Whether or not you believe it is unethical is a matter of personal opinion I suppose (I believe it&#x27;s unethical), but it is at least illegal.<p>Now, let me clarify: there is nothing wrong with giving a company a deadline before you go public. But 7 days is far too small of a deadline. 90 days is better. And if you do this, you don&#x27;t seek payment, you do it because you&#x27;re a professional security researcher who cares about their security, not because you&#x27;re trying to make a quick buck.<p>When you find a vulnerability like this, you proceed carefully. Contact a software developer, or better yet, a security team member (if they have one) who is technically savvy enough to understand your report. It would be best to do this anonymously. Email is strongly preferable, but you can escalate to Twitter if it means being put in contact with the right person. Obviously this means asking for help with security on Twitter, not disclosing the vulnerability publicly.",1423779086

In that instance you&#x27;re just vetting your design until you convert it over to a mask-programmable &quot;equivalent&quot;, or do a full-custom design.  The interesting things about an FPGA would be to use its inherent parallelism, fine grain programmability, and the reprogramability to run circles around something constrained by a von Neumann bottleneck in the cache hierarchy.<p>As to clock speeds, here&#x27;s part of the abstract to a white paper that might interest you:<p>&quot;A clock rate higher than 500 MHz can be supported
on a mid-speed grade 7 series device with almost
100% of the logic slices, more than 90% of the DSP48

Even if she was loyal but I was screwing around,  that would greatly increase her chances of painful and serious complications since she&#x27;d be exposed to a much wider microbiome of things I bring home.<p>We had a friend who has had a somewhat disorganized sex life involving multiple terminations of unwanted pregnancies with different partners and she got an IUD after hearing our glowing testimonials.<p>Not long after it got infected;  there was not any permanent damage but it was an unpleasant experience and it deprived her from what is otherwise one of the best forms of birth control.<p>I can&#x27;t say for sure that her disorganized sex life led to her IUD failure,  but I&#x27;d be concerned that young women who are practicing something in the spectrum between casual sex and serial monogamy with boys that are doing the same won&#x27;t have as good results as committed couples do.",1423778648

When they stopped updating the mac version I started poking around the files to see if I could backport some of the maps from the newer PC version to the older mac version. One of the first things I implemented was texture import/export. I wanted it to work on entire folders at a time and I didn&#x27;t want to rely on EXIF annotations to store the pixel format of textures so I relied on the hack of looking at the histogram to see if an image should be stored in the compressed format.<p>At first I thought I had a bug: I knew for a fact that some textures were stored uncompressed (RGBA8) and some were stored compressed (DXT3,5) but they were all importing as compressed. Turns out the bug wasn&#x27;t in my code. Someone had lossfully compressed the textures and then stored the compressed images in an uncompressed format.<p>I sent the devs an email letting them know how they could save ~50% of their download size at no further loss of quality by re-enabling compression. I never got a direct response but the next day they banned me for hacking. Naturally, when the next version of the game came out the problem still wasn&#x27;t fixed.<p>A few years later I told my parents. My father, who had served in the army, just laughed and said &quot;Now that&#x27;s the Army I remember!&quot;",1423778461

9041646,comment,9039754,9041297,0,0,pash,,,"In the Bayesian and inductive-logical view of probability theory, you must define a probability distribution with respect to an information set. That set formalizes your observations of (and assumptions about) the state of the universe, and the entropy of the resulting distribution quantifies the quality of your knowledge about the universe.<p>From that perspective, the second law of thermodynamics simply says that the quality of your knowledge about the universe with respect to an information set assembled at time <i>t</i> degrades as you move from <i>t</i> out into the future. Put like that, it seems rather obvious, I think.<p>Quantum theory further tells us that it&#x27;s not possible to assemble an information set that is complete, in either the sense that (a) we can get a perfect picture of the universe as it is right now, or that (b) the quality of our information won&#x27;t degrade over time. (The two senses are equivalent, and you can probably see why.)<p>So Laplace&#x27;s demon can&#x27;t exist.

847738,comment,833434,834002,0,0,Radix,,,"<i>Anyhow, I just wanted to point out that when I think back about my life so far, the part of it that scares me, was when I took my religion and decided that I had to take it seriously and </i>do something.<p>I'm not sure you'll see this, but bringing this up should be fine now the thread has died.<p>Why do you feel that way about that time of your life?  My experience has been exactly the opposite.  When I was in high school I began questioning God.  I attended a small church school with poor academics and being average and not knowing how to study in school I spent a good deal of time questioning the moral instruction I was given.  (There were better reasons, caused a crisis regarding gods existence at 10. Fun.)   The only difference is that I didn't accept that the reading the Bible was necessary.  What bothered me most, and still does, was the apparent hypocrisy.  Plenty of people in church, but none of them seemed to hold the traditional beliefs my family did.  It was the little things, as well as boyfriend/girlfriend sort of things.<p>But, even now, after rejecting Christianity, I still have the greatest respect for those who really do believe.  My grandfather who took his family to Argentina to teach college as a missionary and founded a chain of christian radio stations is probably the finest man I have ever met; my grandmother is similar.  My ex-girlfriend spent last year teaching children in India.  A sweetheart I wish I was with.<p>Due to my experiences I don't see why you were scared of the time when you sincerely followed your beliefs.  To me this should be lauded, even, if I believe it is a false belief.<p>So, why do you feel that way?",1254110264

847726,comment,847044,847468,0,0,elblanco,,,"Glad the author is here, so this doesn't stay one-sided! Some people here apparently think I'm trolling, but I'm simply cutting to the chase and hoping for a spirited and informed debate.<p>Mr. Guo, your article stands in opposition to itself. On the one hand, you try to state that ""given comparable levels of intelligence or skill"" and on the other ""only the smartest have the highest grades"". Your only example is one that does not draw a comparison of comparable persons (or rather, reaches the conclusion that an A student and a B student are not comparable or equivalent). And then you directly relate this situation of grades=intelligence to the world of adults. You don't say, ""only smart people get into top schools"", but the implication is pretty apparent.<p>Over the past few decades, largely because of the rise of the Internet, and the equalization of information access this brings about, <i>name brand</i> schools are finding themselves greatly diminished in reputation (it probably didn't help that our last president was mysteriously from Yale). World class research now regularly comes from lesser known schools without ridiculously large endowments. I'm not sure the same could be said 50-100 years ago. Yet an attitude persists in the ""adult world"" that people from tier-1 schools should start their careers higher and progress faster because they have somehow received a higher <i>quality</i> of education from their esteemed institutions of higher learning.<p>I think that this attitude is demonstrably false. In 14 years I've worked with a variety of people from a variety of educational backgrounds and I've seen virtually no difference in performance across the board. In fact, in the last two years I've had to take 2 Ivy League grads off of projects because of their failure to perform.<p>Understandably, many grads from these schools don't turn down these unearned opportunities (when was the last time you heard of a Harvard grad asking for a smaller starting salary because it wasn't fair?). I wouldn't. But to the folks who did not, for whatever reason (grades, opportunity, money, family, immigration, etc.), attend a name brand school, this unfairness smacks of all kinds of bad.<p>If I choose to ignore the elitist garbage in your post and focus only on your stated central argument, you decry their only avenue of dealing with the situation -- making noise about it. Yet you offer no other alternative except for an unstated ""you shoulda gone to a better school then.""<p>You've chosen to define this state of things as elitism, if you can find me a dictionary with a definition of elitism that matches your I'll eat my hat. You do hit the nail on the head with this however,<p><i>""Such an attitude is understandable, since alumni from top-tier schools have an implicit symbol of status from the name-recognition of their diploma, but alumni from more obscure universities often get puzzled replies of ""hmmm, sorry, never heard of that place"" when they mention their alma mater. Thus, in order to prove themselves as worthy colleagues, they must strive to more actively advertise and demonstrate their skills and technical competence, because their peers, superiors, and outside observers are not going to give them the benefit of the doubt.""</i><p>A person saying ""but I'm just as good as that guy from a name branded school!"" is not elitism by any possible stretch of the word. It's a desire to seek equality and be given a fair shake. Something that, being a student two name branded schools you will never ever have to deal with. For a salient example, can you guess how immensely hard it is to even get a call back let alone a job from Google if you didn't graduate a top school? Who's elitist? The Stanford grads that don't call back the folks who graduated from xyz State University, or the people who graduated from xyz State University? These people <i>have</i> to make noise just to be seen beyond the brick wall of tier-1 graduated middle level managers in any organization.<p>But to my reading of the entirety of the article, what you seem most upset about is the declining status of the elite schools, and that people should have the temerity point this out in the real world. Instead of elitism, I think you are trying to turn this state of things into a kind of victimization. It's kind of sad really, the rest of us peons have had to get by on merit, it's time that the elite did also.",1254109904

847703,comment,847443,847643,0,0,Shooter,,,"Yep.  And MetaCard was pretty cool for its time. It actually had some Lispish qualities mixed in with the cross-platform, multimedia HyperCard stuff (which was very cool on its own.)  There used to be a whitepaper online that explored that aspect of it (HyperCardy 'macros',etc.)  RunRev inherited all of that with the MetaCard engine, but of course now there are more compelling offerings for most things...although it's still a pretty neat multimedia tool if you're mainly targeting the desktop or CD-ROMs for some reason.  I wouldn't personally use it for web stuff or DVD-ROMs anymore, though.  It <i>is</i> flexible.  I still know people who use it for <i>everything</i> (including CGIs ;-) ) and I know a couple of shareware developers who still make their livings using it.<p>I'd probably use RunRev before I used something like RealBasic, which is basically in the same market -  small, 'soup-to-nuts' shareware developers who want to create desktop apps with multimedia, internet, and database capabilities.  Heck, I'd use it before I used Authorware or even some of the Python tools in that  general domain (PyCard, etc.) because it was faster to develop and you put out a more polished product, without cross-platform woes.  The MetaCard kernel engine is actually pretty fast, execution speed-wise.  It could handily beat Perl for some stuff that you wouldn't think it would even be useful for...we scripted a performance testing tool and a utility to put database records into HTML, and it trounced Perl for both tasks.  Which was impressive, considering Perl would have sucked at making cross-platform multimedia apps ;-)<p>I almost invested in RunRev when they were first getting started...IIRC, Mike Markkula (Apple fame) <i>did</i> invest in them.  The founder, Kevin, is pretty cool.  I ended up just becoming a customer and using it as a prototyping tool.  I still have an older Pro license and a couple books about RR if anyone is interested...<p>Anyone remember GLPro?  That was another niche app we used to make prototypes and build small multimedia apps and screensavers.  It had a dBase style engine in it?  We used it for a screensaver once and it ended up on an episode of Star Trek Next Generation.  Or iShell?  That was a later one we used that was based on another defunct Apple tool.

I heard this is because they will only use Chinese parts where possible, instead of Taiwanese, Japanese, or Korean parts.  Needless to say, the Chinese cannot make LCDs.)<p>HP doesn't make good laptops, Dell doesn't make good laptops (they are good at making laptops whose batteries last for about 15 minutes after a few weeks or so), Apple is Apple (nice screens, same crap everywhere else), etc.<p>I might consider Asus next -- the eeepc 901 is the nicest laptop I've had.  Nice screen.  Unfortunately, the wireless card is a piece of shit that sometimes takes several tries to associate to WPA2 networks.  ""Known firmware issue.""  Great.<p>Basically, everyone wants cheap, cheap, cheap, and that's what they get.  People that actually use computers are part of their profession and not just for watching porn are shit out of luck as a result.<p>(I will edit to add -- pricing things out, the desktop is an amazingly better value.  For $2000, you can get a high-end Thinkpad with 2G of RAM, 2 cores, and a 160G SSD, etc.  Or you can get a desktop with 8 cores, 16G of RAM, a 24"" monitor, 4T of disk space, etc.  Laptops are nice if you absolutely can't work at a desk.  But if you can, you can save yourself a ton of money, and just use a netbook when traveling.  I do this, but with a Thinkpad as my ""desktop"".  It has not been undocked in years.)",1254107799

Let's say that you want your data in a relational DB (for reporting, company policy, integration, whatever) but can stand a very small risk of losing a few seconds worth in the case of a huge failure.  You'd gain by avoiding the latency of network-to-db and disk forcing.<p>So, you write DAOs that ""persist"" to a queue and to a shared map(s).  When you read, you look in the map first and go to the DB upon failure.  Queue consumers persist messages (inserts/updates) to the db. After your application reaches a steady state, you shouldn't have to read from the DB much at all.  And, you could build an eager loading mechanism for efficient start-up.<p>Even without async persistence, I'd prefer one of these solutions over memcached/MySQL replication hackery.",1254107630

However, it does offer persistence on those servers, so one could use Terracotta in place of a database.  Also, Terracotta works in the (historically) Spring-like way of not requiring any modification to an existing codebase.  One declares which objects ought to be distributed, and magic just happens (supposedly, I've only been reading up lately).  Terracotta does bytecode manipulation on those object references and on Java synchronization blocks to achieve what is explicitly specified with this system.<p>Another project to look into is JBoss's recently re-branded and improved cache:<p><a href=""http://www.jboss.org/infinispan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jboss.org/infinispan</a><p>I've been thinking about a problem lately that will likely require one of these technologies, so I've been especially curious.",1254107124

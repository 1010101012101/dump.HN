684450,comment,683807,683851,0,0,Nelson69,,,"> I wonder if we just have a generation of programmers who can't think in SQL. They're used to using ORMs (which are useful abstractions) but can't work at a lower level. Sending a query over the line to get exactly the results you want, and no more, and have it optimized and run entirely on server is pretty damn efficient.<p>Yeah, it's really obvious if you ever work with a really really senior DBA.  I don't think it's the queries though, it's the modeling.  I think a lot of software teams model their database sort of like they model data structures and then use various ORM tools to be the glue.   DBAs tend to model the data in ways to make it most acceptable to the database and minimize the loss of any information, it's almost always more complex.  The database as become an object persistence engine in a lot of cases that has some relational properties that may or may not be used.    Instead of writing and managing files in the filesystem, you shove stuff in to a database.<p>Just for starters,  your ORM will model an object for a row of data,  how many times do you get the whole row when you're really interested in just a column or two?  Does your ORM let you just specify the parts of the row you're interested in or does it hydrate an object and populate all of the columns?  (Those extra columns being copied does add up...)  ORMs are a religious war,  as a software engineer it's a really beautiful idea,  in reality I've never seen one that really works well with the database,  they're too softwarey.<p>The other thing that seems to be rampant is the traditional 3 tier application model has kind of collapsed.   It's not the case everywhere but I've seen it at more than a couple places where there is a persistence tier and then kind of a combined presentation/business tier.   With a more traditional data model the business layer is absolutely critical and shows a lot of value,  you might have to glue some more complicated queries together in to objects inside a transaction rather than just hydrating a row from a table.   When you use a database as a store for your data structures a business layer just doesn't seem to be as valuable.<p>If you just want keyed data storage,  a relational database does become the wrong tool.   I would think, and this might just be parochial thinking,  that at some point keyed data storage would essentially reinvent the relational database as the problems grow in complexity.",1246545212

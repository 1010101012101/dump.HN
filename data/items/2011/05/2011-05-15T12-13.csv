They're experiencing chronic and severe downtime, mainly as a result of technical debt - AWS can only take so much blame when firms like Netflix got through the outage fine. Even when AWS isn't undergoing major outages, ""emergency read-only mode"" has become rather too common.<p>When two members of a three-man developer team quit at roughly the same time, that's a warning sign.<p>Reddit looks to me to be in a similar situation to 4chan - a huge, highly influential user base that is actively hostile to monetisation. It looks to me like the best case scenario is that Nast is deliberately smothering Reddit - all the other explanations for their current problems bode much worse.",1305464283

For framework writers to give some thought to performance issues does not make users of that framework less productive.<p>Also, if you look at what just a few selective type hints in clojure can do to performance or how terse Scala code is, you have to come to the conclusion that performance and productivity can go hand in hand.",1305464194

There is no shared cache across requests or processes, so if you read in data that hardly ever changes, you're hitting the DB for that data on each request.  This was a rather big shock to me when coming over from Java, where I used to use Cayenne* (<a href=""http://cayenne.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cayenne.apache.org/</a>) for the ORM.  Cayenne has some pretty nifty tunable caching features out of the box and I just came to expect those as being a requirement of any serious ORM these days.

2549835,comment,2549240,2549791,12,0,nirvdrum,,,"I think your example might actually support the parent's POV more than it refutes his stance.  Exception handling isn't just slow in 1.8.7.  It may be slower in 1.8.7 than 1.9.2, but exception handling is universally slow.  There are a variety of reasons for this, but unrolling an exception is fundamentally slow and until there's native support for them on the die, that's likely to remain the case.<p>So, creating a situation where you're guaranteeing an exception is raised during non-exceptional execution flow is generally a bad idea.  It may be cleaner or more concise code-wise, but performance-wise it almost certainly will always be slower.<p>For the most part I believe the parent is correct in that there is a much stronger emphasis placed on code conciseness/clarity than there is on avoiding performance anti-patterns.  It's hard to measure whether the gains in ""code agility"" outweigh the local performance hit by making it easier to surface other performance problems.  When there's less code involved it usually follows that it's easier to spot and fix problems.  But I worry because my own experience suggests that death of a thousand cuts is a considerably harder situation to get out of than dealing with a handful of gnarlier bottlenecks.",1305462585

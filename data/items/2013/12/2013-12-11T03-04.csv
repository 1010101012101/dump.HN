6885832,comment,6885226,6885764,3,0,bmelton,,,"I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a panacea, but at least pertaining to labor laws, Trader Joe&#x27;s is fairly well regarded.<p>A couple of simple rules that would take you a very long way towards being the &quot;right&quot; kind of company:<p>- Pay better than minimum wage.  Pay a lot better than minimum wage, in fact; even for the lowest employee.<p>- Pay your highest paid executives less than we&#x27;re used to seeing.  I don&#x27;t know why, but people just absolutely hate it when CEO of such and such is making $x million dollars a year, while the cashiers of so and so are absolutely starving on minimum wage.  Cap executive wages to some multiple of the lowest wage.  If the CEO wants to make a $10 million a year, then the janitor would have to make $1 million a year; as an example.<p>- Don&#x27;t cap employee position pay.  Have starting wages, of course, and make them generous, but if a cashier has been with you for 172 years, she should have received raises (assuming they were merited) every year, or be let go, if she didn&#x27;t merit them.<p>- Don&#x27;t lobby Congress for personal / business gain.  I&#x27;ve argued it <i>extensively</i> elsewhere on HN recently, so I won&#x27;t go into it again now, but I think that people&#x27;s problems with capitalism aren&#x27;t actually complaints with capitalism, but a complaint with the crony capitalism that we have in America.  IBM lobbies for increased patent protections, makes a billion dollars, pays the guy who thought of it $10 million, and now everybody hates IBM, and especially that guy.  If the system were both fair and fairly applied, sure, the Fishtowners might complain, but there would be more in the way of income mobility for the motivated, which should elevate the lower class to a true middle class for those willing to earn it, which would act as a bulwark against unruliness.<p>When Warren Buffet complains that he&#x27;s being taxed too little, the cynic in me thinks that he wants his less rich competitors to be taxed out of being able to truly compete, while he enjoys his largesse, knowing that no amount of taxation would <i></i>really<i></i> have any impact on his lifestyle.  For as generous as progressive seems when taken away from the uber-rich, it actually is a penalty for those just on the cusp of wealthy, and keeps them stuck in middle class without an effective means of pushing past it.",1386734354

With enough computing power, it&#x27;d be trivial to run this sort of analysis in near real-time for everyone. A few years down the line, this is even less of a concern: increased power, improved analysis tools, and greater efficiencies will all come together to empower just such a system at costs manageable by many local governments (particularly if they start working together to manage costs).<p>This means you&#x27;ve got a practical means of confidently predicting potential crime. Even better, the same mechanisms that help you predict potential criminal acts also help you close active cases more efficiently. That inevitably results in significant boosts to police productivity.<p>So armed, you now get to deploy your existing resources more effectively. Instead of parking a patrol car at a &quot;pretty good spot&quot; to nail violators for a few hours, you&#x27;ll reposition yourself continuously to the location offering the greatest probability of an arrest/citation at that specific moment in time. Instead of passively waiting for violators to happen across your location, you&#x27;re actively positioning yourself to nail them directly. The specific individual doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>But you won&#x27;t be dispatching patrollers in the current manner. Since you&#x27;ll also be tracking your own patrol cars, you can correlate the two and dispatch each car to the highest probability incident nearest to them where they&#x27;re likely to catch a potential perpetrator. By having everyone under effective surveillance, for every minute of every day, each of your resources will always be deployed in the most efficient manner possible.<p>Where it really gets wild is when you start to consider traffic enforcement automation along with the push for local government drone coverage. Along with the existing red light and speed cameras, you&#x27;ll have mobile platforms capable of filling in for any holes in your patrol car coverage while also benefitting from the same efficiency gains described earlier. And they&#x27;ll be gathering additional data (movements, facial recognition, automatic number plate recognition, etc.) to send back to base while they&#x27;re doing it.<p>It won&#x27;t be like The Machine from Person of Interest, but all things considered, it&#x27;ll be closer to it than anything else to date.",1386733671

These practices are largely attributable to businesses whose policies are endorsed and enacted through government. Government politics are a complete morass and you&#x27;ve done an excellent job of painting how various parties might try and solve the problem.<p>So if government is a morass, how do you approach the problem? Certainly a career in politics is out of the question based on this presupposition. One might consider simply adapting how they act in their daily interactions with others. Personally I think this idea is too small-scale.<p>In my opinion, one strategy would be through the business side. Create a business whose policies create the type of change necessary for closing the gap between the mega-rich and &quot;middle&quot; class. The argument has been made in this thread that in order to compete, it is impossible to instate these types of policies. However, I believe this to be a false assumption. Certainly companies, even large ones, fall into a spectrum of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; practices. There appears to be no bound to either side. I take the David Deutschian view that any problem can be solved with the right knowledge¹.

Let&#x27;s say your user is on spotty wifi and they hit the submit button for your form. Guess what happens if that AJAX request fails? Probably a whole lot of nothing, unless you&#x27;ve got some templates client-side to show an error message. At that point, if you&#x27;re making your error messages fit into each of your UIs, you&#x27;d might as well just be using client-side templates anyway and SJR is moot.<p>On top of that, you can&#x27;t update the UI in a meaningful way until you get a response from the server.<p>That&#x27;s also not even touching any security considerations that you need to make to use this technique: you can&#x27;t implement a CSP, you&#x27;ve got to make damn sure you&#x27;re properly escaping every piece of data [in a special way] that comes through, and you&#x27;ve got to make sure the response that you&#x27;re sending can&#x27;t be used in a script tag (i.e.: you need to add an intentional syntax error that you strip off) or an attacker could simply put a script tag on his own site pointing at a URL on <i>your</i> site that returns sensitive information.<p>TL;DR: Badasses only.",1386731250

Publicly Israel has very uncompromising policies. But maybe in private, in return for some things they are willing to give up some of their demands.

In order to reach a point where it affected his ability to live life normally, he had to eat sushi twice a day, every day. Furthermore, his doctors said that a few months of treatment would solve his problem.<p>It seems likely to me that the amount of HFCS you'd need to eat in the very unlikely worst case to get actual mercury poisoning is going to give you diabetes before the mercury affects you.<p>Which is not to say that we shouldn't stop allowing people to sell mercury laden HFCS! If 9/20 studied samples contain no mercury, they all should, it's clearly a public health problem. What I mean to say is just that this is likely only to be a serious problem for a very few very heavy HFCS consumers, if any, and that people shouldn't take it to mean ""I can't eat HFCS because I'll get mercury in me"", because they probably won't get clinical amounts of mercury.<p>There's plenty of good reasons to avoid HFCS, I advocate that to everyone, but I don't think that the fear of the mercury found by this study is one of them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.answers.com/topic/high-fructose-corn-syrup-1#cite_note-31"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.answers.com/topic/high-fructose-corn-syrup-1#cite...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_much_does_a_can_of_soda_pop_weight"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_much_does_a_can_of_soda_pop_we...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/news/20081218/jeremy-pivens-high-mercury-count"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/news/20081218/jeremy-pivens-high-mercur...</a>",1233111169

It's difficult to get your message to millions of people at one time using the Internet.<p>From the consumer perspective, however -- the internet is the clear winner, if you must choose one. There are millions of streams available at any one time.  That's the beauty of it.  That's why Internet video will win in the long run or at least be a viable option for the individual over television.  If you are willing to sacrifice mainstream content, ditch the TV and go all Internet.  I haven't had a TV in over 6 years.<p>But Mr. Cuban is right, TV will be around for a long time. It will remain the winner for mainstream content, but the Internet isn't about mainstream content it's about access to content that isn't popular enough to warrant distributing to the main streams via traditional wireless routes.<p>Anyone here also TV free?

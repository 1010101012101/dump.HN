Every VM worth its salt compiles the bytecode to something just as good as optimized C at runtime (it's called ""JIT"").  The JVM does this, Parrot does this, and even SBCL does this (even code you type into the REPL!).<p>So basically, there is no performance reason to avoid VMs.  If you're wondering why languages like Java and Lisp run slower than C on average, though, it's because the constructs are different.  C is assembly; everything you write is basically a CPU instruction.  CPU instructions run really fast.  Things like memory management, cons cells, OO system MRO lookups, etc. don't run all that fast.<p>So basically, you pay for expensive language features; you don't pay to be running on a VM.<p>Finally, is it more disrespectful to provide a neat tool that burns battery, or to not provide the tool at all?",1213268376

However sentimental this may sound, there's nothing else that distinguishes outstanding engineers from good ones; there's nothing else that can predict the most important career dilemma in every programmer's life: to be a coder forever or to abandon coding for management and... UML.<p>And thanks for the post, enjoyed reading it very much.",1213268137

215812,comment,215536,215738,0,0,porfirion,,,"Hm, I still remember how it was when I tried to understand iteration and recursion.<p>Of course I understood the concept of doing something x times with increasing counter, but I couldn't see the clear relation between what I wrote and what it did. It seemed a bit magic and I wanted to ""truly understand"" it before mapping the concept to syntax. It seemed too arbitrary to me to rely in my thinking on such magic.<p>My strategy was to unloop every loop I saw. It was ridiculous, I didn't have enough resources to keep even smaller loops in mind and I quickly forgot them. After few days I just gave up and committed it to my memory. Only then I felt that I truly understand.<p>I think I tried programming skipping this step but I just got irritated and really unsure if what I'm doing makes any sense. I remember it being the same with recursion, except a bit more mind-boggling. Now every time I try to understand something similar I try to reduce it to simplest case and just commit it.<p>I suppose other people may be unaware of what is actually keeping them from understanding and never get that far.",1213266505

That's a bit of a stretch.<p>Could there be some kind of uber- sharing-synchronization program? Beats me. Seems like there are a lot of market segments and problems. Why would we want one, big, bulky product that does a gazillion different types of synchronization?<p>You see, Microsoft gets it both ways. They write the product that does everything, people bitch about enterprise apps. If they write a dozen niche products that are somewhat similar, people bitch about duplication.<p>For me? I'm a big Groove fan, even if they did cut the crap out of the features to make it less competitive with their other stuff.",1213266089

215801,comment,215527,215527,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"By SharePoint I'm assuming you mean Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007<p>I had a client last year that was looking into it, so I did a lot of research and playing around for them. I probably read about eight books on it. In addition, I wrote a small application that automates the hooking up of Sharepoint into other Enterprise datastores (like web services or DB2 databases) I also am using at my one of my large clients. I know a little about it.<p>Yes, it's a beast, but large-app software is like that, so everybody stop complaining. It also has fine-grained security, so that comment was off-base. I think the learning curve is too steep for Joe Blow the startup guy to use to it's maximum effectiveness. On the other hand, it does enough out of the box to make it an interesting option for small teams. The shared calendaring in Outlook and shared list management in Access make it attractive. Add in offline access with Groove, and learning just a few features can give a team a lot of power.<p>To really understand MOSS you have to realize that it is the future of Microsoft's platform: shove everything out onto the web, then write workflow and security and forms management and office integration into it. Office becomes more of a gateway to use SharePoint than a stand-alone product.<p>I know the first time I saw the workflow engine work _inside_ of Office docs I thought that was a pretty cool integration. Likewise, endusers being able to create their own web pages with live data from other systems? Neat. I can see a natural progression for a startup to begin with Groove, then graduate to MOSS once things start cooking. It would certainly be better than using a dozen other free apps that all do not interoperate -- as long as you don't eat up precious time fooling around with it. The whole point is to leverage the parts that work together naturally, not become a MOSS expert.<p>But the look of the thing? Butt-ugly. No getting around that. The UI is so bad it's hard to convince people that there is as much going on under the hood as there is.<p>In short, I'm not crazy about it, but the more I think about it, the more value I can see it bringing a small team.",1213265134

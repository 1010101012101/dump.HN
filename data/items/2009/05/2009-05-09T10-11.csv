600891,comment,600862,600862,0,0,cottsak,,,"Never experienced it myself (with my site/business) but i have observed it a little.<p>My (humble) suggestion: Your product/service/business is likely to thrive (you've already said your T&C has 'evolved' since their copy) and given the ever-changing properties of this tech sphere - change rapidly! Design/aesthetics/marketing material and the like are great, but it's your customer service that's going to keep business - so focus on that. If you update your site design and it’s copied again, dont worry. Like you said: it must be good right? The value you offer to your customers is you - your service, your passion and your values. That can’t really be copied - well, not effectively. Focus on the things that matter. Sure it might hurt to be stolen from, but rise above. Your customers will notice.",1241866265

I will certainly put all your suggestions in practice.<p>I am more a security type of person (and unix guy) and that's why I tried to keep the page simple, but I guess I left it too simple :)<p>Btw, did you get a chance to register and look at the application internally? I would love some feedback from there too.<p>thanks",1241866240

600888,comment,595343,595755,0,0,gaius,,,"I appreciate that; I am something of a ""languages pioneer"" at work, and I have gotten good traction with Python because the learning curve is very shallow. You can use it a a glorified shell script and get something useful done very quickly and as you learn more you can add in the FP goodness, OO, whatever you want, it grows with you. Now looking to take it a bit further, I am shopping around, Haskell and OCaml are candidates, but to sell this on the grounds of, learning this and using it will get your project done quicker than continuing in what you're using now. So I have shot myself in the foot a bit; Python is <i>really</i> productive, and other than the language itself, the biggest factor is the ActiveState ""batteries included"" distribution.",1241865977

Almost all marinas have wireless, and you can get 3G phone cards that will give you decent transmission a few miles off shore. If you're further out than that you're probably not programming anyway. Not unless the weather is really calm and you're at anchor.<p>This is in Europe, but I expect it is the same in the US.",1241865841

I know that this is kind of off topic so pardon me.I am really interested in getting the Google g1 phone and developing for it, but i live in a country where its not for sale. I would like to know if anyone here has a used/unlocked g1 phone for sale or exchange?
Thanks guys",1241865436
600883,comment,600790,600848,0,0,gaius,,,"<i>especially if you can convince them to let you work under your own rules</i><p>In my experience (two acquisitions by public companies) it never quite works out like that. Most recent experience involved ""we won't change a thing"" up front then after the deal went through ""stop working on cool new features until you've integrated your product with our legacy code"". And from their perspective that was exactly the right thing do to; they'd bought us for what we could do for them after all. But for me personally, reverse-engineering ancient, undocumented Delphi apps wasn't what I'd signed up for.",1241865369

600874,comment,600790,600853,0,0,wheels,,,"That's a little too echo-chamber-ish for me.  I think most people have ""normal"" jobs because either (a) their life doesn't revolve around their work or (b) it's never occurred to them to found a company.<p>The first takes a couple forms.  During the last two ""normal jobs"" my life was focused on open source work and music, respectively.  I didn't want to ""monetize"" either of them, so the best solution was having a job that was loosely connected to them and allowed for that (working in the LinuxLab of a large corporation, and then a pro-audio company, respectively).  For a lot of people it's their families.<p>The second I think is also pretty common.  It just hadn't occurred to me to start a company until a couple years before I did.  Not to mention, that because of visa requirements, it wasn't possible.<p>Founding a company has been a great experience, but my life revolves around that now.  For those who do not find that desirable, working for others seems a fairly sane choice.",1241863529

What's the big deal? Most of them were useless and ugly anyway. And yes, there <i>is</i> a weather indicator application that you can install.<p>On the other hand, you have a global menu that becomes also a title bar when the window is maximized.<p>So in Ubuntu 10.10 if you maximize Firefox, you have the following taking up vertical space:<p>- The top gnome panel<p>- The title bar<p>- The menu bar<p>- (by default) a bottom gnome panel.<p>With unity, there's only one thing:<p>- The Unity panel.<p>It's the panel, title bar, and the menu bar combined into one panel. (there's no bottom panel).<p>I would never want to go back to the classical gnome desktop.<p>The Ubuntu button at the top-left is like gnome-do[0] on steroids.<p>There's honestly nothing from classical gnome that I miss.<p>Btw, you <i>can</i> drag and drops applications onto the launcher. At least it works when you drag them from the desktop. He's right though, the lense view[1] doesn't let you drag/drop. You've gotta keep in mind though that's not a finished product yet.<p>Having said that, dealing with application icons in (classical) gnome was never a pleasant experience, so in this sense, Unity doesn't really lose you anything.<p>[0] gnome-do is a quicksilver clone<p>[1] That's the new fancy thing that pops up when you click the Ubuntu button on the top-left",1301838749

He specifically referred to the start fund and the end fund.<p>I said, umm I think that was an april fools article. He was like really? I said, I thought the part about giving funding on a first come first served basis may have been a good tip off. He was like, please dont tell anyone I said this. I laughed and said I couldnt commit to that, but I wouldnt use his name. :)<p>I let him off the hook a little by saying I generally try not to read news on April 1 because it is a hassle having to sift through fake articles.<p>http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/01/angel-investors-counter-y-combinator-start-fund-with-new-100-million-early-stage-end-fund/",1301835895

On its own, inequality very well might not.<p>But other factors might be at work as well. Consider the effects of envy, or more precisely, ""relative deprivation"" [2]. There's been research indicating that no matter how well off humans are on an absolute scale, we tend to become dissatisfied when we perceive that we're worse off than our neighbors; we tend to believe we're somehow entitled to do at least as well, or even better, than they. (See also  ""keeping up with the Joneses."")<p>Envy is probably a product of natural selection; it can be a useful motivator, at least when properly channeled.<p>On the other hand, envy might be less adaptive in an era of global mass communications. It's certainly easier today for millions of people to become aware of, and then (perhaps subconsciously) resentful of, others who seem better off than they.<p>So it could be that we have a combination of causes at work:  Increasing public awareness of wealth inequality leads to increased envy, which might indeed start to erode the social fabric.<p>If this turns out to be the case, what could we do about it?<p>Some might say humanity should be less envious, that people should just accept inequalities of wealth as natural consequences of their own limitations. History suggests that they -- or should I say, we -- probably won't.<p>[1] Joseph Stiglitz, professor at Columbia, former chief economist of the World Bank, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics 2001 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_deprivation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_deprivation</a>",1301835660

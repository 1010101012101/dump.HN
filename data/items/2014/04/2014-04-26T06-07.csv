The solution is to program on your own, choose your own projects, don&#x27;t be limited by what you&#x27;re required to do for work.<p>And stop caring about what it&#x27;s called.<p>> Any idea idea on how to practically make use of concepts like descriptors etc to understand python in depth?<p>Yes.

Deployments at different organizations can be linked, to make (part of) the namespace of one company be visible to that of another company. It has a permission system on namespaces.<p>But one of the nicest features is that it has a built-in C-like trigger language. You can specify triggers for certain namespaces. E.g., for research, it is often necessary to pointers to data (URLs) that are permanent and can be published in e.g. papers. For this reason EUDat[1] has triggers on namespaces that automatically create PIDs[2].<p>But since the trigger language is very complete, you can do nearly anything with it.<p>Note: I am not involved in iRODS anyway, I just know a couple of colleagues who use it for safe replication, sharing, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eudat.eu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eudat.eu/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.pidconsortium.eu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pidconsortium.eu/</a>",1398494165

When you look at a repo you don&#x27;t look at one unique version of the whole repo, you can create quite advanced &quot;queries&quot; such that for folder /src you look at your branch, for folder /3dpartylibs you look at version 5 and for folder /tests you look at head(latest). And since your working directory can be network attached (dynamic view) you dont have to &quot;update&quot; manually, head is like a living animal! Its like having subrepos built in.<p>While this is interesting it also requires a lot of discipline and almost one person dedicated as full time &quot;dba&quot;  to not end up with spaghetti. Since there is no unique version number of the repo you have to store these queries and manually keep adding labels to be able to go back to an exact point of time.<p>It does have some uses like being able to run a new test on old code to find the first version when something broke or being able to change versions of external libraries or blob assets quickly but its hard to say if its worth it since it comes with so many other problems.",1398493799

No stutter though.<p>I don&#x27;t think you have any solution apart from acceptance (which would help with the stress levels I guess). Accept your limitations, find someone do sales for you and in investor meetings, if there is a question that you couldn&#x27;t answer very well due to the stutter, send a followup email to an investor explaining it.<p>Apart from that, do your best, don&#x27;t measure up yourself to others and try your best to avoid replaying affected conversations after they are done.",1398492962

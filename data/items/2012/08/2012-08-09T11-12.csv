4360575,comment,4360271,4360271,34,0,a3_nm,,,"In college, the machines in the computer labs had no speakers, but I found out that by logging on the TTY you could make the PC speaker beep at an arbitrary frequency. You could only play one note at a time, though... except if you used several machines. So I wrote a daemon and a script that would take a MID file and dispatch the various voices to all machines in the room (the daemon used NTP to ensure that everyone started at the exact same time).<p>The sound quality was awful, but the spatial effect was pretty cool because the sound came from everywhere at the same time. I got cool results with Mario, Pokemon, Tetris, but also some of the Goldberg variations or the Art of Fugue... But this was December, so I dug out a few Christmas tune MIDs and set them to play at random intervals until Christmas. As it turns out, a song triggered during a class once: a lot of people thought the sound was coming from their machine and freaked out, and the teacher spent some time trying to figure out from which machine it came before he understood what was going on.<p>At some later time we found one computer with sound, so we set up a daemon to monitor logins on all the machines in the room and had a GLaDOS-like voice blurb out a personalized greeting to newcomers.

It worked by hiding buttons and menus and trying to prevent you from opening up various apps or clicking certain files in common dialog boxes.<p>My first ""hack"" was just a boot disk that simply copied fortress.exe to another directory (a little choice.exe with autoexec.bat magic).<p>The second hack came later. The computers were upgraded to Windows 98 and my autoexec.bat trick stopped working because of a BIOS password. Thankfully the machines came with Word which had nice shinny feature called Visual Basic for Applications. Most of the shell was hacked to hide menues still in Fortres 2.0 but good old VBA was still accessible. Using VB I could call Win32 apis and it was just a few calls to enumerate and kill the startup entries for fortress in the registry.<p>The best part of this was that it was all sanctioned activities sort of. The IT department was in a central building downtown (30 minutes away from our school) and who was always a pain to work with for the teachers. Their gradebook apps failed under fortress and even their teacher passwords failed to disable all the shell hacks. Shutting off fortress was the only compatible way to get things to run correctly for the teachers.<p>At first when the local IT department found out, they laughed, but then later got upset when the disk of my magic word document spread. It was making it's way across the district via email lists.<p>At some point in the school year I got accused of spreading 'a virus' to other students that allowed them to download 'warez' on school computers. Apparently fortress was the only thing preventing kids from using WinPopUp and windows NT messenger to send broadcast messages to all desktops across the network.<p>I tried to fight it and explain exactly how the thing worked and the silliness of shell hack in the first place. It didn't work. The Principal said I was hacking regardless and suspended me. After getting the suspension (and after they called my parents who knew before I did and were very upset already), I quickly called the computer programming teacher (who knew knew C++ and VB and had previously been an assistant for in my sophomore year). He called the principle and super and explained that I was not hacking and that I was 'improving productivity' and that the IT department's policies were hindering teachers. I got out of the suspension by the super the next day but no apology was given. Just a stern ""stop hacking"" the next week when I got back.<p>I was later voted most likely to succeed by my class. Apparently in a class size of 1200+, I was well known for my exploits.",1344511082

I like this site, it is useful and very well organized, but feature availability (browser & level) is not as well documented as in w3schools I find. Chrome is probably not the issue here, rather - let's name it - IE.<p>MDN is a great site, don't misunderstand me - but in this case I am not sure this is the right hoster. I used MDN for some JavaScript issues like one year ago, and it was then running well on FF but not at all on IE. Maybe they have all corrected that since, but I'm not seeing that clearly now.<p>dochub looks nice, but again it is not something for beginners.<p>Also, MDN is client only (which is one point making me say it is very Mozilla oriented). w3schools has this part about PHP which is very useful for beginners. Again, my point hasn't changed. MDN and others are more useful resources to experienced web devs than w3schools, but w3schools is the better point to begin with when you don't know about web development and want a clear overview.",1344511071

Nikon can't even get the mirror-less interchangeable lens system right : what were they thinking with the Nikon 1 ? the sensor is way too small, much smaller than the already small sensors of the Four Third system from Olympus/Panasonic and the size of the sensor is one of the most important thing to consider when it comes to image quality.

439255,comment,439235,439235,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I'm in the habit of opening the link and the discussion (if any) in tabs immediately after each other. Then I can flit back and forth as required.  Middle click - tab open - job done.  I think your suggestion would slow me down.<p>It also doesn't work in those cases where there is, as yet, no discussion, as often happens with my submissions 8-(<p>Perhaps there should be a new link that opens a new window with left and right frames, left with the article, right with the discussion.",1232276231

439251,comment,438001,438203,0,0,chris11,,,"One thing I really like about the idea of Facebook Connect is that I don't have to manage multiple accounts. I usually only register an account on a website if I can see myself using it semi-regularly. That said, like you mentioned, I don't like having it tied to my real name, and Facebook account, so I've never used it. So if I want access to the member's area I usually just check bugmenot.com to see if they have account info.<p>So I guess what I'm saying is that if you want an open id system on your site, FC would be good because it has such a large userbase. On the other hand I don't know many people that use any open id system, so integrating with FC might be a waste of time.",1232274851

I personally feel that more effort is being put into eclipse, hence it has a longer term future.<p>A big win for Eclipse is the ubiquity of an easily installed, strong, consistent virtual machine across OSes. Cygwin is a great achievement but too much like hard work. I'm compelled to use Windows in my day job, with no admin access, and being able to use the same development environment with my linux box at home is great.",1232274727

So the distributors (who aren't technically needed in the digital era) are trying to find a way to stay relevant and the studios have been subsidizing the cost of digital installations, so it has been very slow going.",1232274352

When the UI is nice, everything works great. When you're in mushier territory, emacs (and vi) are like text-editing power saws, they're pretty good at moving text around, but rarely understand the code, so the things you're used to working are pretty much always available.",1232273546

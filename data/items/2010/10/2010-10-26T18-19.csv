1835533,comment,1833010,1835415,0,0,nadam,,,"Python is a better language than Java overall, but Java has some advantages over Python: because of static typing it is faster and has a very good IDE support. (autocomplete, code navigation, refactoring, etc...) In my eyes the most superior languages have static typing with a clever type inference, so that the code remains concise despite static typing. I like Scala because it really has the best of all worlds. (Although really mastering it is a bit more work than mastering Java or Python.)",1288119580

What you're seeing is oddities in how the iframe is working. It's not a perfect process and I'm trying to figure out better ways to encapsulate the original site.<p>As for speed, I watch my logs like a hawk and have graphs for how each feed performs. No feed should take more than 500ms to load (and only a very very tiny percentage have taken more, based on my graphs from today. And nothing took more than 1.5s). Speed is a super high priority for me. Moreso than many features. Preloading is hard to do. I have no idea what you want to click on.<p>The iframe buster buster code works about 95% of the time. It should catch most NYTimes sites and switch you automatically to the Feed view. It doesn't always work.<p>Fixes for these bugs will be coming in the next few weeks as I sit down and identify the culprits.<p>You should still go premium, even if there are a few bugs still lurking. Check the features board. I have updates regularly and have for months. It's a long road ahead and things only get better from here.",1288119541

1835449,comment,1791718,1827448,0,0,Dove,,,"Oh, you're serious!  I apologize for the critical response;  I thought you were just making fun.<p>So, the ontological argument in its ancient form is very much vulnerable to the criticism you gave.  When I encountered it in philosophy 101, it ran like roughly this:<p>(1) A being that exists is greater than a being that doesn't exist.<p>(2) Therefore, the greatest possible being, God himself, must exist.<p>We talked about it for a while, and then the prof rephrased it with ""vacation spot"", and we all laughed and moved on.  It's a well-known critique, and it shows the argument must break down somewhere.  We stopped there (as you did), but I think it's instructive to see <i>why</i> the argument doesn't work.<p>I came up with what I thought was the core problem: the argument doesn't prove what you think it does.  It doesn't prove that God has to exist, only that your concept of him must include existence if it's to be coherent.  For example, suppose I am at work fantasizing about the great boss I could have instead of the one I <i>do</i> have.  For the idea to work, I must imagine that he really exists, and really works where I do, and is really in charge of my work.  Those things are part of the concept.  That doesn't mean they're true.<p>By contrast, when I imagine Mickey Mouse, I don't imagine that he really exists.  ""Is fiction"" is one of the properties of the concept, and I'm okay with that.  I don't need to imagine I can look him up in a phone book in order to enjoy stories about him.<p>So much for the logical.<p>There's a deeper problem with the argument, though, and it's this: I find it rather amusing that the philosopher thinks the best deity is well defined.  I mean, has he ever tried, in practice, to define a best <i>anything</i>?  When real people talk about real things, they often have a hard time agreeing on the best football team this year, or the best local chinese restaurant.  The idea of a ""best"" or ""greatest"" something is incoherent in a vacuum.  Best for what?  Greatest in whose opinion?<p>Of course the philosopher might say, ""No problem.  The greatest possible being is the one <i>everyone</i> would agree is the greatest.""  I think it's rather optimistic of him to so blithely assume that's even logically impossible.<p>Imagine there was a sympathetic atheist out there.  In his opinion, it's a very good thing that God doesn't exist, as his activity would make robust science so difficult -- and a world that has robust science is a much cooler than a world that has a deity.  But he's sympathetic.  He can see that people who believe in God often have better lives because of it.  Some of those born again Christians really <i>do</i> turn things around, so the concept has to be good for something.<p>From his perspective, the best possible deity is a fictional one.<p>That rather explodes the argument, doesn't it?<p>Now, if you read Plantinga in the original (<a href=""http://mind.ucsd.edu/syllabi/02-03/01w/readings/plantinga.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mind.ucsd.edu/syllabi/02-03/01w/readings/plantinga.ht...</a>), he gives a long and entertaining summary of the ontological argument throughout history, famous criticisms and objections and his own attempt at repairing it.  I cannot claim to have fully wrestled with it (I'm going to be chewing on it all morning, likely -- I hadn't read it closely before, thinking ontological arguments were inherently uninteresting sophistry), but here is what I think I do understand:<p>The argument runs this way:<p>(Definition 1) Call a being <i>maximally excellent</i> in a given world W if, in W, it is omniscient, omnipotent, and wholly good.  (Note that the omniscience thing implies existence).<p>(Definition 2) Call a being <i>maximally great</i> if it were maximally excellent in every possible world.<p>(Premise) There is a possible world in which <i>maximal greatness</i> is exemplified.  That is, in some (maybe imaginary but nonetheless coherent) world, a <i>maximally great</i> being exists.<p>(Conclusion) A being that existed in every possible world would have to be logically necessary.<p>(Conclusion) Such a being exists.<p>How does this differ from the ontological argument of yore, and what do I make of it?<p>I don't think it's trying to accomplish the same things, and I don't think it suffers from the same criticisms.<p>At a high level, it has a premise -- and once you unpack it all the way, that premise is equivalent to saying God is <i>logically necessary</i>.  It's a premise.  You're free to reject it.  Plantinga claims to accept it (!), but notes that not everyone does (a heck of an understatement).  He doesn't seem to care: the object of the discussion isn't to establish that God exists.  The article opens and closes stating that the argument will not change anyone's mind, and that the reason we're even talking about it is because the discussion teaches us some interesting things about how to do philosophy -- things like, what do we mean by ""exist"" and ""necessary"" and ""possible"".<p>What Plantinga does claim the argument shows is that such a being must be <i>logically necessary</i> or <i>logically impossible</i>.  God (so defined) is either essential or incoherent.  I agree.<p>It handles my metric objections pretty well -- there's no subjectiveness in the words, all the definitions are nailed down pretty well.<p>How does it do with cheeseburgers?  Let's try it.<p>(Definition 1) Call a cheeseburger <i>all-yummy</i> in a world W if all beings in W who taste it consider it to be clearly the yummiest cheeseburger they've ever had.<p>(Definition 2) Call a cheeseburger <i>maximally yummy</i> if it is <i>all-yummy</i> in all possible worlds.<p>(Premise) There is a possible world in which <i>maximal yumminess</i> is exemplified.  That is, in some (possibly imaginary but nonetheless coherent) world, a <i>maximally yummy</i> cheeseburger exists.<p>(Conclusion) A cheeseburger which is <i>all-yummy</i> in every possible world must be logically necessary.<p>(Conclusion) There is an <i>all-yummy</i> cheeseburger in this world.<p>Now, I would say the argument is similarly valid.  It establishes that the concept of a <i>maximally yummy</i> cheeseburger is either logically necessary or else incoherent.  But in the case of cheeseburgers, it's easy to argue that it's incoherent.  Of all the possible people in all the possible worlds, surely we can find two with incompatible tastes.  We could imagine one guy who likes cheeseburgers better the more cheese they have, and another guy who likes his cheeseburgers with the lightest hint of cheddar possible.  No one cheeseburger could satisfy both of them.  Hence we reject the premise, saying the concept is incoherent.<p>But it doesn't exactly work the same way with God.  People have tried through the centuries to say the three omni-s result in an incoherent being, and the modern consensus is that they've failed.  It is possible that such a being is coherent.<p>Is such a <i>maximally great</i> being coherent or impossible?  Many folks throughout history have said impossible, and Plantinga has no quarrel with them (well, he does, but not here or at least not much).  And some theologans, Plantinga included, have said the idea is coherent.  You might think that, for example, if you found some sort of first cause argument to be persuasive.<p>Personally, I have no opinion on the matter.  I have not heard an argument either way that I find persuasive (though I do think it's theologically unnecessary and practically unlikely). In any case, it's not the sort of thing I care for -- I prefer evidence to armchair philosophy.<p>That kind of brings me back to why I recommended Plantinga for reading, though.  I don't recommend him because he's apologetically persuasive -- indeed, I recommend him because he's not.  He talks about whether things are reasonable or unreasonable, whether it is rational to be a theist or irrational to be a naturalist, and what rational even means.  He's interesting reading if you think (where this discussion started) that religion as a whole is transparently irrational.  I'm not trying to convert you; I wouldn't recommend an apologist, as that's an ideological attack.  I recommend Plantinga because I think you'll find him <i>interesting</i> and <i>alien</i>.",1288118365

Traffic generated was < 20 visitors over 3 weeks.<p>2)Facebook Ads: Thanks to a Facebook sales exec who saw my startup and was interested I got some traction and ended up generating 100 clicks with about 50,000 impressions which is not too bad, but generated no sign ups.<p>3) Direct Email Marketing: Contacted a sample of 100 businesses who are potential clients in different industries: doctors, accountants, dentists and cleaning services. Zero replies.<p>4) Contacted a specific newsletter for CPAs however the advertising costs are well over $10K. Didn't try.<p>5) Contacted a local radio and was asked for $10K budget for 10 airings of the ad + $750 ad production fee; off the table.<p>6) Directly contacted my own circle of professionals in the health space with one sign up.<p>7) Google Ads: Does generate some traffic but the visitor pattern on the site suggests that it's my potential customers' customers who are coming to my site not my potential customers. Still ongoing.<p>8) Currently In Progress: Bought special purpose vertically focused domains such as appointmentForDentist.com, etc and managed to show up on the first page of Google Search. Some traffic being generated but too early to tell if there will be any sign ups.<p>9) Currently In Progress: Printed out brochures with information on the service and will use snail mail to send it out to potential list of customers.<p>10) Next: Will show up at local business events and try to market the product personally.<p>In order not to spoil the post I did not give out the name of my startup, if you made it thus far here you go: smartpointment.com",1288117737

And I think this is particularly relevant for using search data for your display business but, would love to get your thoughts on that.<p>Eric Schmidt: ""We have a pretty strong opinion that we're not going to do very much of it. The reason is that we take our end-user data privacy incredibly seriously and the trust that people have with respect to giving us that information, both their search histories as well as other pieces of information, they get very upset, very, very quickly if we, in their view, misuse it.<p>""So, what we typically tell people is we're not going to do the kinds of things that you could do with this, in particular use it to generate sort of strange ads against your history and things like that, without your explicit permission. And we probably, in many cases, won't do it forever.""<p>--Q3 2010 Earnings Call, October 14, 2010

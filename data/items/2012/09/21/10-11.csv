4553203,comment,4552951,4553145,11,0,dasil003,,,"Is this true though?  It's easy for everyone for all the armchair CEOs to say that Jobs <i>never</i> would have released such an epic fail, but I'm not so sure.<p>If there's one thing that Apple hates as much as a half-baked UX, it's dependency on another tech company.  It seems pretty obvious to me as a casual developer and observer of Google maps over the years that global mapping is really really hard.  How could Apple not have known this?  I don't think even they have this much hubris.<p>Now we don't know why negotiations with Google for the maps API failed.  Maybe Apple was overconfident, maybe Google was playing hard ball for Android's sake, maybe a bit of both.  But regardless of the reason, the contract was not renewed and they <i>had</i> to release something.  The iPhone without maps is not the iPhone.<p>The fact that they used an algorithmic approach to QA says more about the timelines than Apple's beliefs about the overall best approach.  There was simply not time to get people on the ground to do a proper QA job.  Apple's hands were tied.",1348225168

4553201,comment,4552072,4552866,1,0,saurik,,,"I definitely agree with the latter point: if you try something and it is ""in ruins"" you are unlikely to respond with any feedback at all. That is one of the things that Apple needs to do a better job at during their betas: I have personally often just written them off until beta 4 or 5 as ""it is so unlikely to work anyway"" (although I do try to pick it up once they stop doing rapid cycles).<p>However, for your ability to test in the future: the only thing I believe the iOS beta requires related to owning a Mac is that the downloads from Apple's website for the IPSW files are stored inside of disk image files; you only need access to a Mac long enough to restore your device, but I am not certain why you would need a Mac to work with it later. (I would love to be told I was wrong there, however, so I could add that to the list of endemic issues leading to this.)",1348225099

However I have a feeling that anyone knowledgeable enough to profit from this is probably already heavily invested in another system for doing these calculations and/or feel the rules system isn't flexible enough. One thing you could do is to implement sharing. ie, have a list of ""top performing strategies measured from date of creation"".

Everything else wasn't worth touching b/c the quality sucked.  Then Google collected their own in their little cars and stopped paying suppliers.  I'm not sure why Apple didn't have the foresight to understand this was an enormous engineering effort from Google - not only collecting their own data but the whole platform itself.<p>I worked as a consultant for one of the two major data suppliers for 3 years rebuilding their backend.  400 years sounds like a reasonable swag.",1348225020

4553163,comment,4552616,4552870,5,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"When I look at science fiction of the 60's, 80's/90's and 00's, I can usually identify three loose categories.<p>First you have the ""techo-utopianism"", as mentioned by the author. The structure of society is fundamentally different, a utopia that removes all traces of internal politics and war. The technology is dreams at best compared to anything they had in the day. Humans, and possibly earth, are the only real links back to the present day. Or you might have the alien race, often paralleling the future humans of other stories.<p>In the 80's and 90's you get a lot more cyberpunk. The utopia themes have disappeared, leaving more of a more realistic world of corporate greed and capitalism; often a dystopia instead of a utopia. Technology is usually more 'personal', effecting the everyday life of people. The story itself is often more personal, related to a person, and their experience of the world. People are much more 'human' then before. In other forms of science fiction, the aliens might be more human in their actions and technology.<p>The science fiction of late is more personal again. Technology is no longer the driving point of the story, but it is the interactions between people themselves that makes the story. In fact, the technology itself often has no form of scientific theory behind it. It's also much closer to reality, technology of the current day stretched to its limits by designers. If aliens are involved, they are usually used as the token bad guy, or simply another background plot piece like the technology; the stories are rarely about the aliens themselves.<p>So, I guess the answer to ""How do we see future people"" is ""ourselves"", for the most part. I must admit I'm not that versed in science fiction though, but this is what I have seen though my experiences.",1348224218

In this case, if there has always been a working proper way, I think that it is OK to break the bad behaviour and force people to use the proper one.<p>As other have pointed out, the spec says: ""POST responses should not be cached, unless you use a Cache-Control header. In that case do whatever Cache-Control says.""<p>Now, ""Cache-Control: max-age=0"" may have been working fine up to now, but what its meaning is ""this content is cacheable; please retain it only for 0 second"". The first part of the sentence explicitly says that the content is cacheable, the second part is used by the browser as part of its cache policy. Please note that you _explicitly_ declared the content as cacheable. Do you want to _explicitly_ declare your content as not cacheable? Use ""Content-Control: no-cache"". Or just do not set Cache-Control and rely on the default non-cacheable status of POST responses.<p>The only problem here is that Safari is caching POST responses that have no Cache-Control header set. Yes that is a bug. But one cannot complain about the fact that a browser cached a response that has explicitly been said by its producer to be cacheable.",1348223250

Their relationship is a little bit more complex than mere two unrelated companies:<p>Some context: The iPhone has a huge penetration rate in Switzerland (2.9 million devices sold for a population of 8 million people). Switzerland also has very good public transportation, held together by the train system of the SBB. And therefore, almost every iPhone user has the SBB Mobile App installed (<a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/sbb-mobile/id294855237?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/sbb-mobile/id294855237?mt=8</a>), 60-80% from what I heard. Which would put the install base to 1.5 to 2 million installations.<p>The elephant in the room is now this: Within this app, you are able to buy tickets. Train tickets, bus tickets, boat tickets. Not via in-app purchases, everything goes through the SBB ticketing system.<p>This has been working for three years now. Apple never blocked the app, despite it being in violation of some of the more prominent rules of the App Store.<p>My sources within SBB claim that there is no special agreement in place, mere toleration by Apple. I don't know if that's true, but one thing is for certain: The SBB has little interest of fighting with Apple on this front.<p>And Apple might not want to alienate such a huge user base, who would probably feel more loyalty to the SBB than to Apple, but that's pure speculation on my part.<p>On the other hand is the SBB fiercly proud of their design achievments, the clock in particular. Maybe that part of the SBB company (30 000 employees) doesn't care about electronic ticketing and will pursue Apple anyway.",1348222614

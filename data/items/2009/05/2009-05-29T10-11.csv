Wolfram is quite smart, but other than <i>Mathematica</i>, I don't really think he has achieved much at all. Any comparison between the two men is ridiculous.

Many firms now know that it offers more flexibility than proprietary programs, the licences for which often include restrictions on how they can be used""<p>The forrester guy appears to be trying to say ""Companies aren't interested in the politics of free software, they just don't like having intrusive controls and limitations placed on what they can do with the software"" i.e. he's entirely missed the point of Free Software and has just mentally labelled it as ""political"" or ""religious"" and so ignores it.",1243594433

What is, however, is how they've had to leverage that reserve to pay existing and new obligations - interest rates, bonds they've offered, etc. ""In February, HMC, suddenly not looking so smart anymore, started laying off about a quarter of its staff.""<p>This is a real money crunch that has a real trickle-down effect. ""And by the 2011 fiscal year, the university would be cutting FAS's annual infusion of endowment cash by $125 million.""<p>That's scholarships, classes, research facilities, new faculty hires - you name it.

Start taking medication, establish routines for yourself, and you can (continue to) lead a meaningful life. One of the smartest and most productive people that I know is a paranoid schizophrenic; another of the smartest people I know is a chronic untreatable undifferentiated schizophrenic.  I myself am a disorganized schizophrenic, having been diagnosed eight years ago.<p>Now for the bad news:  you should never have posted this, unfortunately, and you should definitely keep information regarding your mental health very private.  Make sure everybody that you tell understands that it is confidential information.  I'd love to tell you that we live in a tolerant and understanding society, but we don't.  Schizophrenia is not well-understood by the general population, and if people find out that you have it, you will have been marked by the proverbial scarlet letter.  If you're lucky, you'll find a group of people who support you.  If you're not, you can expect to be hounded, and you may never escape it.",1243591840

First I could barely hear them, but I did not resist and with time the volume rose; some phrases where as loud as screaming.<p>I also started hearing the chatter without meditation, usually when it was quiet or I was calm enough. It actually was fascinating, as most of the phrases where quite surreal. I even wrote down some of them (it's hard to remember the actual words I was hearing, they disappear rapidly from the memory).<p>Anyway, right now I don't meditate (and sleep significantly more than I was back then); the voices are no more. I'd actually love to see some explanation, and while I have no desire to see a doctor (I don't think it's a decease), maybe you'll tell us what he thinks it is?<p>PS.

And the early usages pointed towards a ""black hat"" usage.<p>Etymologists don't normally use evidence based upon individual memory due to people being very bad at remember exact word usages from decades ago. A few years ago I did some work for the Oxford English Dictionary and while they would use people's memory to guide them to potential recorded sources of evidence, they wouldn't use someones memory alone due to the problems inherent with it.<p>Especially in a emotionally charged issues like this one where people are likely to ""want"" to remember things being a certain way.<p>btw, the poor academic form thing was about wikipedia (from whom which we would expect a reasonale academic form), not you personally, sorry if it came across that way.",1207094053

152613,comment,152367,152485,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As a founder (and the website maintainer) of one of the startups ""attacked"", I'm not too bothered by the criticism.  It is valid...we aren't showing up in all the right places on Google, and we're currently paying a buck or more per click to occasionally appear in those right places in ads.  But, it's also worth noting that while we'd never turn down more traffic we also aren't experiencing significant pain due to that lack.  Our site gets 1800 uniques per day, and is growing at a very respectable clip--I remember vividly celebrating our first week of 1000+ visitor days just a few months back and it won't be long before we're celebrating 2000+ visitor days.  For a site that sells a product (rather than sells eyeballs), that's a nice stream of potential buyers.  Actually, I sometimes chuckle when I read about sites that are selling nothing but eyeballs bragging about 100,000 monthly pageviews (or whatever) when our product site does significantly more than that (and our four sites combined see an order of magnitude more traffic than that).<p>We consider our biggest website problems to be conversion rather than bringing the eyeballs in...so even though I readily admit that we're weaker in the engines than we'd like to be, my current focus with the website is on getting those people who come to our site excited enough to buy our product (or, even better, ask their hosting provider to buy it for them), and better serving those customers that have bought.<p>So, I don't know that we're really a good example of a truckload of SEO fail, even if our SEO results are poorly, since we don't actually live or die by search engine traffic.  Only recently did the majority of our incoming traffic shift from our Open Source project pages to other sources, for example, and those clicks from Webmin.com are still far more valuable to us than search-related clicks...they are about 10 times more likely to buy from us than natural search result users.  Likewise for users of our Open Source Virtualmin version at places like Joyent, who are proving to be extremely likely to upgrade to the commercial version.  This tells me that getting more people using and talking about our Open Source products is a better marketing tactic than almost anything else we could do.  So, we balance our efforts, and SEO unfortunately gets put on a back-burner.  (We do try hard to have good URLs, though, but mainly because I consider URLs a usability issue, and not because I care what a search engine thinks about them.  I just wish Joomla didn't suck so bad for stuff like that.)",1207092741

My opinion is actually based on primary sources from my time at MIT (e.g. alums who were actually students back then).<p>Pontificating about my ""poor academic form"" is harsh, unnecessary, and, frankly, it doesn't suit you; not when your argument -- that you <i>know</i> the first hackers were black hats because you found some article in The Tech where someone said something negative about one -- lacks any semblance of validity to begin with.<p>Given that you're the one with a contrarian opinion, you should present strong evidence if you don't want people to be skeptical.

152607,comment,151980,152552,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Relativity?  Not right now.  You will be able to fly a ship in ""Newtonian"" mode, but with a speed limit (due to collision implementation issues.)  The ship will also fly in ""inertialess"" mode which will be like the way ships fly in Star Wars.  Performance of ships in ""inertialess"" mode will be comparable to that in Newtonian, just with less flexibility.<p>One interesting twist to ship design, will be that the shape of your ship will actually change its stats in meaningful ways.  For example, if you have a ship that uses armor for protection, then having the hull of your ship angled like an arrowhead will give you higher armor values from the forward direction.  (And much weaker from the sides and rear.)  Having a ship which is longer will also improve the performance of axial mount weapons.  However, increased length, size and mass also have drawbacks, as it will reduce your maximum turning rate and the rate at which you can change angular momentum.  Components will require some internal volume, so you won't be able to make an invulnerable Death Pencil.<p>The game will have elements of ""space opry"" and not just have hard science fiction.  I want people to experience the thrill of epic space battles.  There will also be exploration and trade.",1207092193

Is there anything that a PDF form can give you that you don't get from having applicants fill out relevant information into a text box?

533730,comment,533446,533681,0,0,sounddust,,,"Well, in my view security is not a binary, nor is there a silver bullet which renders all software secure.  Security is a <i>strategy</i> in which one implements as many known protections as reasonably possible in order to reduce vulnerability.  In the Google Docs case, I think there is absolutely no good reason not to authenticate HTTP request for components of a document that also requires authentication.<p>Sure, crypto-strong nonce URLs are better than unobfuscated URLs, but that's just one protection.<p>For example, let's say that Google accidentally leaks a directory listing of all files on a particular google docs server (or let's say an access log, to be even more realistic).   If Google had properly authenticated access to these images, then the leaked access log would be worthless and unexploitable.  However, without authenticating these requests, Google has suddenly caused a mass security breach, as hundreds of people rush to wget all the URLs before the images are taken down.<p>If Google is seriously expecting people to use their product as a replacement for a business intranet, then they need to take seriously <i>all</i> concerns.",1238086721

Quite genious when you have millions of tags where each item has about 20 tags.<p>I create one table that contains all 20 million tags with a Unique ID which is 99% a integer just counting up. I also add a column sometimes for a counter which every time a tag gets added to an item, I uptick this counter once. Keeps track of how many times I used this tag.<p>When I tag an item with 20 tags, I create one column for all my tags.<p>So lets say I have tags<p>1, 5 8, 20000, 35, 36.<p>It doesn't matter to me in the database at this moment what they correspond to, but it does matter that I need to make this column as small and easy as possible because with 200000 mil tags and another 2mil items, the database can get huge.<p>So my method is to insert the tags like so.<p>1:35:2000:35:5843:34<p>I then have created methods to where I can find the tags, export them and so on.

533657,comment,532634,533637,0,0,trezor,,,"The complete setup was a 2-node active/passive Microsoft SQL Server-cluster solution with SAN backing, hosting various systems across 5 different SQL Server instances.<p>For clarity and to avoid confusion, since Linux-clusters and Windows-clusters are quite different: An active/passive windows cluster does not distribute load among nodes. A 500GB workload attached to one instance on one node will only have that node to work on. The remaining node will only be for failover. So despite this being a 2-node cluster, it can easily be pictured as a 1-node setup for all practical intents and purposes.<p>Also SAN backing is required for Windows clusters, and hence can't be avoided. For perspective the amount of actual disks used in this setup was far from extreme. I'm pretty sure we are mostly talking about a few LUNs running something equivalent of RAID5 and RAID0 on regular 10k SAS disks. Nothing fancy.<p>No schemas were sharded as that completely breaks referential integrity and is something only done in the MySQL-world and essentially kills the ability to do efficient joins. No special features apart from indexing and use of file-groups was enabled, but if disk IO or CPU had been a problem, you could very simply have setup partitioned tables or distributed partitioned views between linked servers to transparently involve more servers and distribute load.<p>No front-end load-balancing was used, so no client-redirection would be necessary, although Windows clusters allows client-redirection in case of failover. No client configuration apart from the server's cluster-name is needed.<p>Products used: Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition and SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition. Cost of these products will most likely vary depending on what kind of existing licensing deal you have and where you live.<p>My estimate would be that price for this setup is rather insignificant compared to the amounts of data it can seamlessly handle without any developer effort wasted on scaling. No effort what so ever.",1238084155

I don't think they are in a position to point fingers at their competitors as is done in the article.
It is nice that you get real cash instead of store credit. On the other hand, as a seller you are competing with other sellers so you don't get instant credit like at GameStop.
It's a choice everyone interested should be able to make for themselves. The remarks towards GameStop are uncalled for though. They should compete on a service/product level and not pull out some twisted ethical argument how they are better for the gaming industry.",1238083235

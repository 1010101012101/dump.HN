If the writer honestly believes that sentence, he has no business writing for TechCrunch (or anyone, really).<p>I think he's talking about ""the first RoR open source code for a social network.""  But even that is a sketchy claim.  I've contributed to open source RoR projects that were loose social networks as early as 2005.",1209524064

177232,comment,175930,176713,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"So your counterargument is that 1) there are firms that exist as part of the supply chain -- firms that, if they could not flip their services to bigger companies -- would not exist, and that 2) there are smaller companies consisting of employees with built-to-flip careers.<p>I don't understand why you draw this arbitrary distinction between paying someone a fraction of your future cash flows (through stock) versus paying them a stream of cash.",1209523904
177231,comment,177213,177213,0,0,naish,,,"Interesting, but this is not really newsworthy.  Surgeons have been using robots to perform a variety minimally invasive surgical procedures for years.  Intuitive Surgical (<a href=""http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/index.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/index.aspx</a>), maker of the da Vinci surgical robot, is the only serious player in the market, having bought out (and mothballing) their competitor Computer Motion.  (A German alternative was shutdown by a patient lawsuit.)  The major impediment to widespread adoption is cost: $2-3M for the robot and instruments are $3k each (a chip embedded in each limits reuse to 10 procedures).<p>The leading edge in this field is the development of flexible integrated manipulators (camera and multiple instrument arms packaged as a single device 12-15 mm in diameter) that can enter through a single port (hole), as opposed the 3 to 4 ports used in current practice (1 for the camera and 2 to 3 for instruments: grapsers, scissors, staplers, etc.).  Ultimately, surgeons hope to be able to perform many surgeries through natural orifices (mouth, anus, vagina), eliminating visible scars.",1209523894

177229,comment,176789,177153,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I have a B.A. in computer science from a top college, and I agree completely with boredguy.<p>Working on an open-source project or consumer website or other project teaches you to overcome hurdles, <i>but only when they're necessary</i>.  If you're responsible for results, then you have an incentive to find and take whatever shortcuts you can.  You plow through only the obstacles that absolutely <i>are</i> essential to getting the job done.<p>Getting a degree teaches you to work very hard at whatever your professors tell you to do.  A lot of it is pointless; a lot of it is stupid.  You do it anyway, because you have to.  But if you do too much of this, you start seeing things that are really pointless and stupid as necessary, and do them anyway.  This is the kiss of death for a startup: you have to be ruthless about inefficiency, and nobody (other than the blatantly dishonest folks who cheat their way through college) learns to be ruthless about inefficiency through a college degree.<p>I'd stop well short of saying I'd never hire anyone with a college degree, because I know a lot of smart folks who have one.  But I won't make the degree more than a tiny portion of who I decide to hire.  (I'd refuse to hire anyone that had never taken their own project from conception to completion, however - this will weed out virtually all of the lazy and disorganized, and <i>also</i> weed out people who are only good at following orders.)",1209523680
177228,comment,176674,176734,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I think there were a few technical bookstores online, but he was one of the very earliest, and certainly the first to try to have a larger scope (e.g. before it was 'let's sell our inventories online', Amazon's idea was 'let's sell every possible book online').<p>Interestingly enough, Amazon was (if I recall correctly) started as a research project: David Shaw (of the hedge fund D. E. Shaw) asked Bezos (then a VP there) for a list of ways to make money online. At the top of Bezos' list was bookstores. Shaw decided it wasn't worth the risk, Bezos decided it was, so Bezos left the company to found Amazon. Shaw ended up starting Juno, though, so it's not a total loss.",1209523623

177223,comment,176789,177157,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I went to a liberal arts college.  ""Liberal arts"" still describes someone skilled in both sciences and humanites...sort of.  What tends to happen is that the folks who major in hard sciences at liberal arts colleges become those people, while those who major in the liberal arts become basically unemployable.  My fellow math/physics/CS majors (there were only about 10 of us per department per year, so we all sorta combined socially...) used to comment ironically that 50% of Amherst students never take <i>any</i> math or hard science course, yet it is impossible for a science major to avoid taking any humanities or social science courses.<p>Two things you need to remember about this:<p>1.) The folks who major in English and take only easy courses will get their comeuppance in the job market, which now basically <i>requires</i> quantitative skills.<p>2.) Many of those folks go to liberal arts colleges because  they have a particular career track they <i>know</i> they want to do, and they're fully willing to make the financial sacrifices for that.  For example, one of my friends wanted to be a professor of English, specializing in poetry, from the day he got to college.  Another wanted to be a librarian.  They're willing to live like grad students until they're in their 40s to do so, and to take the financial hit afterwards that comes with their chosen professions.  I can respect that.",1209522803

Throwing your fucking ""credentials"" around and writing your own assembler out of Ruby or whatever doesn't excuse you from exercising some basic fucking reading comprehension.<p>The largest system built in Scala is probably pretty small at this point. But like I said if you had bothered to read the fucking post, the risks of moving to a new language when you can keep the rest of a deployment stack are relatively small. You're compiling to the same bytecode, running on the same VM, running on the same server, and so forth. Your IT department or hosting provider doesn't even need to know you switched languages.<p>Please, do me a favor. If you're going to respond to this and tell me that Ruby is the most proven language ever and you can't trust Scala to display hello world, could you try to read the post this time and make at least a passing attempt to respond to the substance of it?",1209521642
177216,comment,176456,176576,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"What you call a ""loser attitude"" is what I'd call being realistic. A lot of people get a little too caught up in the hype and hubris associated with startups, but its important to look at issues from both the positive and negative sides.<p>For example, you can take a rejection from YC and say ""Gee, we got this far, there's something to this idea, we should definitely keep working on it"" and you'd be right. But you can also say ""Gee, we couldn't get into with YC their  (relatively) lower standards, how are we ever gonna impress an Angel/VC?"" and you'll also be correct.<p>So I'm just trying to be honest here. YC would have provided a great vote of confidence needed to put in a monumental effort into this (ie, quit jobs, take huge financial risk etc). Now we'll keep working on it and put it out, and maybe that vote of confidence will come in the form of enough users and growth to convince us to really get into this. Or maybe we've been wrong all along, all the criticisms correct and the thing will fizzle out.<p>But mindless hyperbole of the ""we'll keep going no matter what and change the world"" does little but stroke your ego, which I personally hate.",1209521523

177212,comment,176456,176712,0,0,ericb,,,"I'm sure it's two-fold. YC filters out people who aren't committed. Also, having someone believe in you makes you believe in yourself--it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. This works in a negative sense, as well. For example, when pg says your chances of succeeding without a cofounder are low, if you internalize that, you won't succeed without a co-founder, because ""why try"" if you can't succeed?",1209520921

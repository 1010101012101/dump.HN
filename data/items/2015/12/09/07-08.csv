10702492,comment,10701633,10702449,0,0,mbrock,,,"I don&#x27;t think that question has that much to do with prescriptivism and descriptivism. Prescriptivists want to use the study of grammar to uphold certain linguistic norms; descriptivists find that language works fine without expert supervision; neither is a stance on the scientific origin of linguistic structure. You could be a prescriptivist and believe that grammar is a simplified model: you would just want that model to carry normative weight (e.g. for conservative reasons, or to promote standardized national language, or whatever reason).",1449647992

When we started OnePlus we specifically set out to ignore stores and carriers and instead focus on making a product that people would love and put it in a price range that made it accessible to everyone. If we had made the same product but instead approached stores and carriers to sell it they would have ignored us. If we were lucky they might have done a deal with us that would have been shitty for us and good for them.<p>Since we took the opposite approach, focused on product first and demonstrated user traction and sales the stores and carriers came to us to talk and it changed the whole power dynamic.<p>Every year brings several new mobile brands to the market. Most you will never hear of because they&#x27;re not exciting or special. They don&#x27;t focus on making users excited about their unique product, rather they focus on business deals that even if they go through end up in no sales.",1449647880

Okay, cool, you have a project, it has needs, you wanna track it. How hard is it to use one of the pre-existing formats? We have rpm, deb, pkg, pkgng, etc as system packaging formats. Is your language such a precious and delicate flower that it needs its own packaging format? You can even use your own binaries to manage the bloody database, but can we get people to agree on some sort of standard here?<p>This makes administration non-fun. It means needing to run a separate binary for every single package to audit for any sort of language change. It means that a project that uses multiple languages now needs multiple packaging databases to do its job. Which means that auditing is now much, much more difficult, because you have to go into each project&#x27;s database, figure out what language it is, then call its database packager to get a list of packages and versions, and parse it with code you can&#x27;t reuse for the other ten languages you&#x27;ve gotten on your system.<p>So, before you start creating the next big package manager, please, for the sake of your ops people everywhere, see if someone else has already made a sensible packaging format. Chances are that they have, and by reusing their work, you&#x27;ll make your job a ton easier, and you&#x27;ll make ops&#x27; job a ton easier.",1449647854

There&#x27;s nothing reflected on their website about it yet, it says that pricing is 2.9% + 30c + VAT. Pretty sure it was previously 2.4% + 24c + VAT in Ireland. This means that pricing for non European cards is actually increasing, and the fixed portion of the fee is also going up by 1c for all charges.<p>Also from the mail:<p>&quot;As always, volume discounts apply to our larger users—please get in touch with us once you&#x27;re processing more than 30,000EUR per month and we will provide a custom quote.&quot;<p>Interestingly, the figure on the website is €20,000 so looks like that threshold is going up too.<p>The new rate is a great reduction and kudos to Stripe for dropping their prices - and by so much.

The postulating of an internal thought process &quot;behind&quot; everything is basically what Heidegger spent his life refuting, from what I&#x27;ve read of Dreyfus&#x27;s book... And Wittgenstein explains language as a tool that people use to get things done, more or less. You can talk without &quot;really thinking&quot;, people do it all the time. Grammar is natural in that sense. Pinker&#x27;s &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; mentions studies that show higher educated people in some situations tend to make more grammatical blunders and to be slightly less &quot;fluent,&quot; maybe because of second guessing their language instincts.<p>(Any errors in this comment due to the fact that I wrote it without thinking.)",1449647478

Keeping the same things, just lowering the bill.  However, my mother is the one who is &quot;in charge&quot; of these things.  A campaign to simply change a service provider takes about a year.

The official kind done by a dedicated team with access and knowledge to retrieve city, state and federal data. And the HR kind, where someone without an investigative background and education spends ten minutes doing web searches and online &quot;stalking&quot; to see if the candidate has any untoward elements in their past.<p>The first kind costs hundreds dollars per candidate. The second can be done for about twenty bucks worth of time. You can guess which approach most companies use.<p>It&#x27;s easier on most candidates, too, because a real background check requires them to fill out paperwork. An ad hoc one they may never know about...unless they fail.",1449644850

It does not however guarantee approval for the amount of expenditure they would be claiming. A tax refund of that size would naturally attract the attention of the Australian Tax Office(ATO). The press release is also dated before they could submit their tax return to obtain a 14/15 refund. A key problem with the press release is that there is now a $100million cap on how much expenditure they can claim in a financial year, so theoretically their maximum benefit would be $45million.<p>$120million in software R&D is a very large spend in Australia for one year, Google Australia for example claims about $40-$50million in R&D spend each year. Atlassian and some of the larger banks would claim a similar amount. I have not heard much about DeMorgan before, however if it all checks out they would be one of the most significant powers in the Australian tech space.",1449644548

Meeting with clients when you can&#x27;t travel easily is a challenge. Living in a homeless shelter puts you on the schedule of the shelter (there are in and out times that are strictly enforced at most of them, if you aren&#x27;t in by the curfew, you don&#x27;t sleep in a bed that night), which conflicts with the erratic schedule of an IT contractor. You need a phone that is reliable, and the ability to take calls and emails at any time, which being homeless does not really allow; my friends who are homeless often live by day in coffee shops and libraries and by night in shelters if they&#x27;re lucky enough to get a bed.<p>Also, though I don&#x27;t like it, the reality is that black folks in IT are also facing subtle discrimination on a daily basis. Getting hired as a contractor often has none of the same protections that large companies have in place for people of color being hired as employees (government contractors are an exception in that the government has guidelines in place to help insure minorities are well-represented, but selling to the government is a whole other set of skills that he may not have, and may not be able to obtain given his circumstances). Among people of color (and women) that I&#x27;ve discussed it with, they tend to prefer applying for jobs and working jobs in major companies because the HR processes are designed to be less discriminatory. Small firms, even when they intend to not discriminate often make &quot;culture fit&quot; decisions that exclude women and minorities. He&#x27;s also older. Smaller IT firms are infamous for hiring young and overlooking older candidates.<p>I live in an RV (I did it for four years, traveling full-time, and now I&#x27;m back to it after a couple years of stability), and I&#x27;m being reminded of all of the ways it makes a &quot;normal life&quot; difficult. And, I&#x27;m not dealing with the kind of stuff he is: I have a vehicle and money to travel, I have a phone and reliable Internet, I have a private home where I can have phone/skype conversations with co-workers, etc.<p>Getting out of homelessness is really tough, is what I&#x27;m trying to say, and being homeless makes a lot of things that are obvious solutions to problems for you and I much tougher when you don&#x27;t have the stability and savings and such to fall back on that you or I have.",1449644538

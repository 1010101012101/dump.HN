6080042,comment,6078660,6078660,15,0,babuskov,,,"The article, and all the comments here are missing the main reason for this behavior. I&#x27;m 36 now, and I live in Serbia. When Socialism was ruling, all the companies were owned and run by the state. The wages were determined by the company you work for. Difference in wage for same position in some non-profitable company and a profitable one, would easily be 20x. So, the only thing that mattered was not your knowledge, but whether you could get a job at shoe company or oil refinery. Getting one in oil refinery was much better. The other thing is that people got fired really, really rarely. So, you get the job and you&#x27;re settled for life. Even pensions are much higher and provided by the state.<p>Now, when a foreign company enters, esp. one with reputation of being a big, profitable business, people would assume that getting a job there is the same, or even better than working at a big domestic company.<p>Sadly, this is still true for many people today. We have a lot of foreign companies here now, and many people have got the job, just to quit days or weeks later. Main complaint being: there&#x27;s too much work. People only stick and work in companies where wages are 40-50% above the average wage in domestic companies. We still suffer from low productivity.<p>This is slowly changing, and I assume it will be much better in 5-10 years. 7-13 year old kids who are in school now are growing up in a different kind of system, and their parent are also young enough to have sane perspective on state of things. They enter the workforce in 5-10 years from now.<p>Our main problem now is current youth, who were raised during the war, whose parents could not teach them good value system, because all they could see on television was that criminals and people waging wars are idols for boys, and folk singers for girls. Also, many criminals earned a lot of money during the war and seeing them go unpunished was really a bad message to all children. Those children are 15-25 years old now, and a lot of them simply have no goals in life, see no perspective and either want to become criminals themselves or leave the country.",1374436665

The humble one&#x27;s probably going to go the route of &quot;over-testing,&quot; to some degree (though you could argue that confirming an assumption is right is just as valuable as discovering it&#x27;s wrong). The ego-driven person thinks they know what customers want, but is likely wrong about some things. For the sake of simplicity, let&#x27;s say the humble one will succeed as a result & the ego-driven one will fail. Obviously, that&#x27;s not realistic, but if you consider each person as representing the average success of all startups that operate within their range of the &quot;humility spectrum,&quot; it sort of makes sense.<p>Now imagine that the person in the middle doesn&#x27;t know whether they should trust themselves or to question everything and will operate based on what you tell them. If you give them permission to trust themselves, they&#x27;ll go the way of the ego-maniac. If you tell them to question everything, they&#x27;ll go the route of the humble one. If you tell them &quot;test what you need to and trust yourself on the rest,&quot; they stay right where they are because they don&#x27;t have any metrics for gauging themselves.<p>People will easily detect wasted time/effort spent on testing & adapt to avoid it. It&#x27;s much harder to detect false understanding before wasting time on development.",1374436187
6080017,comment,6078905,6079643,3,0,tomsthumb,,,"> why would we not share a common set of beliefs/practices/language?<p>Religions are big things with many purposes. One of those purposes is self-improvement, and it would be useful for religious people and secular people to be able to communicate about the same set of routines using the same set of vocabulary and so on.  However, this seems to introduce one of two strange situations.<p>A religious person adopting purely secular sets of beliefs and practices may find some of this to conflict with their religion.  They&#x27;re moving from one intellectual/psychological/social context to another. While a secular person might be able to point at how rather non-optimal a set of mental machinery might be, it is also quite likely that a religious person and a secular one have decidedly different understandings of the utility function for &#x27;optimal&#x27; (and at very deep psychological levels).<p>On the other side of that coin, and probably more obviously, a secular person begin asked to acquire religious contexts and practices so as to communicate about this mental machinery would probably find these new shared beliefs/practices/language a bit &quot;crufty&quot;.  This would be totally understandable because all a secular person here would be after is &#x27;self-improvement&#x27; whereas from above &#x27;Religions are big things&#x27;.  All of these mechanics are suddenly attempting to function outside of the context in which they developed.<p>Diff&#x27;rent Strokes and all, ya&#x27; know",1374436173

Self improvement groups do not create the kind of bonds in a community that will cause people to make real sacrifices for their neighbors. As an atheist married to a practicing Christian I am acutely aware of the fact that my wife&#x27;s church offers a level of community, tied together by common beliefs and practices, that I&#x27;ve never found outside a religious context. Book clubs don&#x27;t give you a shared way of life, and political organizations are linked by a common fight not a common way of living ordinary life. I can&#x27;t think of anything in my secular urban world that is quite like the barn raisings my wife tells me about from the small, Christian, town in Iowa where she grew up.

The language is like java and it forces you to declare what exceptions you throw, so lazy people just put in lots of do-nothing catch blocks to silence the compiler.<p>2. The language doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;checked exceptions&quot; concept, so people literally think no exceptions can happen.  They just wait for the exception to make everything blow up.<p>Often when exceptions <i>are</i> handled, this lack of explicitness makes sure it&#x27;s done at totally the wrong stack frame to make the judgement call about what to do about it.  Then some people do dumb shit like try to catch things like stack overflow exceptions which should rightfully take down the process, and keep running.

I&#x27;m not defending Apple at all, I&#x27;ve spent many nights throwing iPhones over the provisioning and certificate process, but to me, the outcome of surviving that process is that I&#x27;m making money from the apps, so it&#x27;s not ideal, but at least my iOS users are actually paying me money, as opposed to Android users that, as a group tend to expect something for nothing.<p>We ought to also look at the inefficiencies of the Android system while we&#x27;re here. 35% of users are still on Gingerbread! You can&#x27;t really expect to earn money as a developer if you ignore 35% of your target market, with iOS we have over 90% running iOS 6 and only about 6% running Android 4.2, which means that developers can&#x27;t take advantage of a new Android feature without leaving behind the majority of their market, or creating multiple versions and then on top of that, having to test on a myriad of different hardware configurations. The fact also remains that Android users are generally cheap -- they don&#x27;t like to pay for apps. So you have a highly fragmented OS environment, coupled with a user base that, in generally spends much less that iOS users and, on top of that, you have a royal mess in the copy-protection scheme used in Android -- which had to be disabled in Jelly Bean due to it breaking apps.<p>Of course, the security in Android is top notch! Great job on that Google.<p>If we want to talk inefficiencies with Apple, we certainly can, but to ignore the Google mess is disingenuous.<p>As far as the effect of Apple&#x27;s &quot;inefficiencies,&quot; is it really affecting them? Are people still buying apps and computers?<p>My last point is that the assertion of Apple &quot;stubbornly refusing to see the flaws..&quot; That&#x27;s interesting, because unless one works for Apple at a level high enough to be involved in the conversation, that suggestion is merely conjecture. That&#x27;s right up there with the pundits being disappointed that iWatch has been delayed, despite having no proof or any acknowledgment from Apple that even such a product exists.<p>There&#x27;s an easy solution to not having to deal with Apple&#x27;s &quot;inefficiencies&quot; -- don&#x27;t deal with Apple and go make your money with all of the people paying money for Android apps.

If you have a lot of servers performing scraping of a service they can sue you for depriving them of use of their service. I simply don&#x27;t see how something like this could ever be launched as a business. However it could exist in another form.<p>Last year I spent a bunch of time on a &quot;bittorrent for webscraping&quot; project we ended up scrapping at work after we pivoted. The p2p approach with a tit-for-tat strategy and a headless webkit approach to scraping is the only long term way we could see where you can scrape legally or at least semi-legally. Our intent was to simply open source the project and let the rest of the world run with it. All the technology is there to democratize the proprietary data industry as has happened with music and movies. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before a lot of that data is freed from silos like Twitter and Craigslist.<p>The strategy was the following:<p>(1) Tit-for-tat scraping where you intentionally avoid scraping websites likely to be in your jurisdiction by subnet. My machines scrape sites in Europe while your machines scrape sites in the US. You also avoid scraping data from services whose data you want.<p>(2) Headless webkit with various methods of avoiding browser fingerprinting. The key is to look as much like legitimate traffic as possible, with the goal of making it as likely that attempts to block a client would affect both real users and scrapers. This is the most powerful deterrent to blocking.<p>(3) 1-1 correspondence between the templates a site uses (handlebars, ejs, server-side templates, etc) and a database of snippets that describe exactly how to convert those templates to JSON data. Any service that provides those template definitions as part of a client-side webapp would be trivial to convert to scraping formula.<p>(4) All the &quot;recipes&quot; for sites and their templates would probably be handled centrally at first the same way torrents were. When a recipe is broken because a site has been updated, the system would know that recipe broke because it periodically checks for good data against a known corpus of previously scraped data. Once a broken recipe has been identified someone could go fix it (conceivably this could be automated as well since you have a known corpus of data and you could detect how an XPath selector may have changed)<p>(5) Distributed hash table pointing to caches of previously requested data so that a swarm for a particular service doesn&#x27;t end up creating a DDoS by accident. Each datum should only be scraped once for a certain interval of time after which the data expires and can be requested again.<p>AFAIK such a system leaves you open to at most a lawsuit for inducing a third party to breach contract, assuming that third party is even in a jurisdiction where they can be held liable. But such a lawsuit would be tenuous at best. Furthermore, you&#x27;d have to prove that the third-party ever visited the site in question through non-automated means because if they never visit the site in question in person, then they can not be held to the terms of service of that site and therefore can&#x27;t be liable for breaching a contract they never agreed to.<p>FWIW IANAL but I have talked to a bunch about this and the above is the closest I could come up with for a service that scrapes sites without running afoul of the law.<p>Anyways, such a system is in the realm of black hat tactics, but to be honest, monopolization of data to extract exorbitant rents and abuse of third party developers is much more despicable. The whole world would be better off if we commoditize access to all sorts of metadata.",1374434888

6079854,comment,6078249,6079630,1,0,bobwaycott,,,"Excellent points, thanks.<p>I hold fidelity to the rule of law of paramount importance. Of equal importance, however, is the principles behind preserving a democratic republic that realizes the greatest possible equality, justice, and freedom for a maximum plurality of citizens. I judge laws and their executions by the latter standard, and I interrogate achieving the latter standard by upholding the former. They should operate in the public sphere in much the same way as we&#x27;ve established branches of government to serve as checks and balances against each other.<p>As a defender of civil disobedience as a means to preserve principles while maintaining fidelity to law, I definitely hold that, while one may legitimately be justified as a civil disobedience if one meets the criteria, this does not absolve one of the status of lawbreaker and merit a need for legal review and/or criminal prosecution of one&#x27;s disobedient acts. So, I think we agree on that point--including that supporting fidelity to law vis  vis prosecution does not equal supporting conviction and imprisonment. I also find it is not inconceivable that one could oppose prosecution in certain cases where the principles are of such grave concern or endangered in such a fashion that prosecution, and especially conviction, can further erode protection of the principles that ought to be preserved and protected by a just society. Also, if one sees a juridical trend in which the courts&#x27; decisions appear to be failing their purpose in the contracted balance of powers, I think we hit a point where, from a critical theoretic point of view, we&#x27;ve got serious trouble. If an executive is trampling the Constitution (or viewed to be doing so by a significant portion of the population), and the legislature is not reigning abuse of power in via specific legislation, and the courts are either passing on or showing deference to the executive (for debatable reasons), where else do the citizens turn in their desire to maintain fidelity to law and protect established principles?<p>(By the way, I&#x27;m not trying to suggest some water-the-tree-of-liberty-with-the-blood-of-tyrants nonsense. History is replete with great examples of tyrants, and none of them have been sourced in the American presidency yet.)<p>The Espionage Act itself, and its amendments, have been the subject of historical, legal, and philosophical criticism. Using it with such frequency to pursue leakers is an interesting historical turn that is, to my knowledge, quite unique to this administration. But I admit that despite my undergrad- & grad-level courses in 20th-century American history, my awareness is likely colored at this point by the frequency with which the Espionage Act is being applied and discussed in such a concentrated period of time.<p>I&#x27;d be quite interested in seeing more information specifically on factor 1, but from a broader frame of reference that encompasses liberties taken with government secrets since WWI and the Espionage Act&#x27;s enactment. If we had enough information on factor 2, that would also be enlightening. Factors 3 and 4 appear to be somewhat discoverable, if enough information was available for interrogation. One could determine the viability of factor 3, while factor 4 is the only one that starts to wander into somewhat speculative territory (at least until we&#x27;re far enough beyond the Obama administration that we can interrogate primary sources to determine its explanatory power). You&#x27;re right that all four factors (and perhaps more) can be true.<p>Anyway, thanks for the thoughts. I&#x27;m going to try digging up more info on these cases.",1374433550

My observation is that Nordic women abstain from drinking during pregnancy at least as often as women who are native born to the US.<p>What would you accept as evidence that your original statement is incorrect? Perhaps the journal article &quot;Alcohol consumption among pregnant women in a Swedish sample and its effects on the newborn outcomes&quot;, which finds: &quot;Before pregnancy, 89% of the women regularly consumed alcohol and 49% reported occasional or frequent binge drinking. Nicotine was used by 15% before and by 5% during pregnancy. During pregnancy, 12% continued using alcohol and 5% also admitted binge drinking.&quot; ?<p>Compare this to the statement in &quot;FOCUS ON: Biomarkers Of Fetal Alcohol Exposure And Fetal Alcohol Effects&quot;, which says that &quot;roughly one of every eight women in the United States continues to drink during her pregnancy&quot;. 16% is higher than 12%, though I don&#x27;t know the error bars to tell if that&#x27;s significant.<p>If you don&#x27;t like self-reported tests, then perhaps &quot;Measurement of direct ethanol metabolites suggests higher rate of alcohol use among pregnant women than found with the AUDITa pilot study in a population-based sample of Swedish women&quot; is useful.

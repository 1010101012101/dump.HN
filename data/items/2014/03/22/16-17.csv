It&#x27;s a combination of marketing, branding, social media management, engagement analysis etc., which are frequently grouped together as the responsibility of one individual in the early stages. This is partly because there&#x27;s not really enough work to partition these into distinct roles until your product or service has evolved a little!<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s just buzzword-speak for knowing your market, advertising your product to them, and analysing the results. All the same features as traditional marketing, and the things this article highlights as important.",1395507583

It exposes all the moving parts, has the best tooling, and pretty much anything you learn about it is applicable to Windows or OSX - though there are parts of both that are unique. A mainline distro with a long term support release makes sense.<p>Hardware, cheap laptop and a cheap desktop and a decent keyboard. I am partial to the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000. With two computers running Linux you can learn about networking, hardware configuration, ssh, and using the shell.<p>Next, Emacs [or maybe Vim] there&#x27;s a reason these are around after decades. Emacs is fully programmable which if your into programming makes logical sense. Plus it forces you to use the keyboard and the keyboard is the fastest most reliable interface.<p>Language? For learning programming nothing comes close to Racket/Scheme. Racket is huge and provides tools for just about any programming paradigm. The two best programming introductions are <i>How to Design Programs</i> and <i>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>.

I would definitely recommend RoR because the speed to development is so critical. With Rails it isn&#x27;t unrealistic to have a MVP within 3 months. Especially with 10-15 hours a day.<p>And you can get a macbook air for around $900-$1300. That&#x27;s all you really need, nothing fancy.<p>And if your app is meant to be mobile, you can get deep into mobile web development and even create a very native experience. That&#x27;s what forecast.io did.<p>Also as you probably know, in startups it&#x27;s more about proving a model than having a fancy piece of software. Think about what features are going to attract customers asap. Iteration is easier when you have customers giving you feedback.<p>IMO RoR is the fastest way to make those vital iterations.

But none of the services on top of that have come up so far as something I feel I need. But I&#x27;m doing mostly research (which is also my job) and side projects, not running a tech business. I need servers, not so much services. There are some vaguely relevant services (like machine-learning-as-a-service), but I generally don&#x27;t feel comfortable being dependent on an external service for my actual research. So I&#x27;d only use these if it was an ancillary need and not something where I might need to publish the results. There&#x27;s also a move towards asking researchers to ship VMs of their test setup as a replicable archive of the work, and dependencies on external services are a no-go for that.<p>For my personal life, Dropbox is the closest I came to paying for.

To them, it&#x27;s like a set of different, often frustrating tools rather than, well, an amazing piece of technology that can be prodded to do whatever you want (to the point where an iPad with few to no apps can provide them with all they need).<p>To me, there&#x27;s a joy to finding just the right framework, app, or library that can do what I need done. To the point where I might end up enjoying the process a bit too much and get nothing done. To them, it&#x27;s all about getting stuff done as soon as possible, with whatever they&#x27;re familiar with. And since they find computers often quite frustrating, they will abuse the hell out of the little bits they know.<p>And so, in the same way that we would use a lighter to open a bottle if there isn&#x27;t an opener nearby, they &#x27;abuse&#x27; technology by using Excel for everything, or storing their notes in an open notepad window without saving. And as long as that works most of the time, they feel absolutely no incentive to figure out a better way.<p>Until, of course, it all goes wrong. Then they call us to fix it :-).",1395507066

Going through the simplified and unified but still arcane ACA application process personally brought this home for me, especially when I realized it is a system that can become a single entry point to multiple varied entitlement programs that formerly each had their own different qualification rules.  Digging into it I saw that one of the goals behind it was to get more of the people who are entitled to Medicaid into Medicaid, the biggest barrier being that it takes a college degree and several days of dedicated work to navigate your way through the application process (I exaggerate, but not by much)<p>I also agree that we are decades away from sufficient public outrage to fuel the political machine to make these changes.

7449744,comment,7445685,7449015,8,0,nkoren,,,"> I don&#x27;t understand - how does a Basic Job prevent you from either going to school or taking part time work? No one is obligated to work a Basic Job. It&#x27;s just what you do if you are unable to find anything better.<p>With this comment, it becomes difficult to see how you&#x27;re arguing in good faith. If your Basic Job tells you to work at a particular time of day -- and classes and/or a part-time job are in the middle of this work schedule -- then they conflict. Sure, you can go to school and/or take the part-time job instead, but then you starve.<p>How is it that you&#x27;re incapable of understanding that this creates a conflict?<p>> Back of the envelope calculation, please.<p>Okay, using your straw-man scenario, there are 50M people requiring $20k worth of income. That costs $1T upfront (same as if we provided the $20k Basic Income to all 300M people). Now with our Basic Job, we&#x27;re basically asking people to do work that they don&#x27;t want to do -- since as you point out, if they&#x27;re not closely supervised then they won&#x27;t do the work.<p>So let&#x27;s assume we need a poorly-paid supervisor for every 12 basic-jobbers, a somewhat better-paid line manager for every 20 supervisors, a somewhat well-paid district manager for every 50 line managers, and an actually well-paid regional manager for every 100 district supervisors. Furthermore, lets assume that all these jobs come from the ranks of the currently-unemployed, so that they&#x27;re not <i>pure</i> overhead but are providing support in and of themselves.<p><pre><code>  Job description   $/year   No. of people   Total cost\n  Basic Jobber      20k      45,973,453      919.5B\n  Supervisor        30k      3,831,121       114.9B\n  Line Manager      40k      191,556         7.7B\n  District Manager  60k      3,831           0.2B\n  Regional Manager  100k     383             -\n</code></pre>\n...This would be an overhead of about 4.2%, compared to the effectively zero overhead which a Basic Income requires (all you need for BI is one-time-only verification of citizenship, and careful monitoring of when people die so that the payments stop. You don&#x27;t need to employ millions of people to do that).  So this would cost roughly $420M more than an equivalent Basic Income program, while simultaneously preventing 50M people from doing something more useful with their lives.",1395506479

7449735,comment,7447505,7449560,4,0,bunderbunder,,,"> Thanks, I read that article. Do you think Indian English is strictly colloquial similar to the dialects of English we have in the US? Or does it have its own accepted grammar enforced by proofreaders and copy editors?<p>I&#x27;d suggest that&#x27;s a distinction without a difference.  Or to be more precise, it&#x27;s a distinction whose difference - the level of official ossification built up around the dialect - isn&#x27;t really relevant to the question because it has more to do with external factors, and little to do with the language&#x27;s actual developmental status.<p>For example, American and British English have crossed the boundary that you propose despite being so similar that native speakers are often hesitant to even regard them as different dialects. But they do have separate rulebooks, because at some point in the past few centuries Americans of high social rank decided that England&#x27;s culture was no longer the ideal to which they should continue to aspire.<p>On the other hand, take Haitian Creole and French, which are so different as to not really even be mutually intelligible.  But up until very recently Creole did not have an official grammar (or even spelling) enforced by proofreaders and copy editors.  How come?  Well, Creole&#x27;s spoken by poor people, and French is spoken by rich people.  Rich people set up the social institutions you propose, and for a long time they had a strong interest in maintaining French as the only official dialect.<p>The example is extreme, but I hope it does illustrate that there are actually two different continua at play here, and while they may be correlated they aren&#x27;t closely tied together.",1395506362

7449710,comment,7449281,7449281,17,0,cmer,,,"Here&#x27;s my verdict in MongoDB after using it for a few years in a very high traffic application:<p>I personally love most concepts behind Mongo. Schemaless, simple replication and sharing, JavaScript console, just to name a few. MongoDB is pretty much my dream database.<p>However, the ugly truth is that it doesn&#x27;t work as advertised (this was 2-3 years ago). Replication would often crash or stall leaving us with only one option: DELETE OUR ENTIRE DATA SET and start fresh. Acknowledged by 10gen at the time. This happened 3 times.<p>Mongo was fast until we hit a wall. That was was at around 200GB for us, which is not that much when you put things in perspective. It was ridiculous. Running a given query took 1 ms and running it again right after could take up to 15 seconds. You&#x27;d think the second time would be faster.<p>The global write lock is just insane. This simply cannot work in a high traffic application. Our app was write heavy and this bit us in the ass quite a bit. We didn&#x27;t feel this until much later, after we were fully invested in mongo.<p>Lastly, 10gen was literally the worst tech company I ever dealt with. They we&#x27;re plain disrespectful to me, calling me cheap for not wanting to shell out 100k/year on a support contract. I was willing to pay them their hourly support rate (which is very high, but that&#x27;s fine) to have them fix their replication bugs with our dataset.<p>For us, MongoDB was a terrible mistake that I&#x27;ll never make again. I&#x27;m glad the truth has been coming out over the last couple of years.",1395506121

In order for identity or anything else to be experienced by someone, they have to be operating.<p>There is an episode in Star Trek where a transporter accident didn&#x27;t destroy the original copy. Obviously a copy of someone isn&#x27;t that someone because identity is a transitive relation, and the two copies aren&#x27;t each other!<p>So by simple logic, a copy of someone isn&#x27;t that someone because you can have multiple copies. Of course the real issue is the question of someone&#x27;s identity in the first place.<p>Because identity is a TRANSITIVE relation (meaning if A is related to B and B to C then A is related to C). And two copies of the same thing aren&#x27;t each other.<p>Actually identity is an example of what&#x27;s called an EQUIVALENCE RELATION which means it is reflexive (A is related to A), SYMMETRIC (If A related to B then B related to A) and transitive. Those 3 properties are necessary and sufficien for a relation to be an equivalence relation. An equivalence relation partitions a set into subsets called &quot;equivalence classes&quot; where all members are equivalent.<p>So the big question is, what is the relation here that would form equivalence classes between copies of a person? Perhaps it is that two people are the same if, in some sense, they arose as a natural continuous change from some previous biological thing.<p>That way we can acknowledge the vast complexity of what it&#x27;s like to be human and alive, and still make a meaningful definition.<p>It just so happens that this definition is along the lines of hinduism - I&#x27;ve been listening to some Alan Watts lecture recently.",1395505800

And yes, my anticipated use-case almost completely maps with reality.<p>Now, before I explain myself, a bit of disclaimer (apart from the obvious - I&#x27;m not a native English speaker ;) ). I like to wear a watch, taking out the phone from the pocket to check the time don&#x27;t work for me. Also, for various reasons I usually can&#x27;t ignore notifications from my phone (my employer is in different time zone than me, I have small kids, etc). So this is <i>my</i> use case, I have no doubt that other people have different expectations/needs.<p>The original Pebble looked too plasticky to me, Samsung watches are abominations, we all hear that Apple and Google is cooking something but v1 from Google is usually a disaster and v1 from Apple is usually pricey, shiny and pretty limited, so I ordered Pebble Steel in early January. My experience so far:<p>- I stopped checking the phone every now and then, especially during the conversations/meetings - if there is some notification, I&#x27;ll see it on my wrist. No more &quot;did the phone vibrated?&quot; moments.<p>- Having notifications delivered to my wrist is super useful when I&#x27;m home, and the phone is not in my pocket.<p>- Even more useful having a smartwatch is when I&#x27;m driving - instead of pulling the phone from the pocket and trying to stay on track, I can just glance on the wrist and see is it something important or ignorable.<p>All of these use cases is something I anticipated, and so far I&#x27;m happy. But not everything is smooth:<p>- I have an iPhone, the Pebble app on iOS don&#x27;t work always as expected. So I developed a habit to run the app in the morning, to prevent it to be kicked from the memory.<p>- Someone would expect to have basic watch functions on the watch. Pebble don&#x27;t have a stopwatch, so I need to run third-party app to measure time. Which is nice, but Pebble OS don&#x27;t support multitasking, so if I exit the app (accidentally or on purpose - maybe I want to check time), stopwatch stops. Same for timer applications. I would be nice if the OS have some basic hooks for such essential functionality<p>- Alarms are <i>dumb</i>. I can have working-days-only alarms on my old G-Shock, but I can&#x27;t have it on <i>smart</i>watch?<p>- Currently I can&#x27;t buy a plastic/rubber/silicone wristband for my Pebble Steel (because of &quot;smart&quot; case design), so I can&#x27;t swim with my watch.",1395505405

7449637,comment,7448721,7448721,2,0,lkrubner,,,"MongoDB offers the greatest benefit to those who have an evolving concept of their schema, and that tends to be startups, though I have worked in large firms that entirely re-invented their schemas. I worry that I would seem tedious if I listed the places that I have worked, and yet, on Hacker News, when I speak in abstract terms, I tend to get downvoted, so I will name a few specifics.<p>I worked at Wine Spectator for a year (2010-2011), <a href=""http://www.winespectator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.winespectator.com/</a> . They had built their first web site circa 2000 using Oracle, Sun Solaris, and Vignette with Java templates. Circa 2009 they decided to scrap the old, expensive system and move to PHP/MySql and the Symfony framework. They could not decide what their new schema should be, so, in the name of keeping things flexible, they decided that all data would be in a single table. This table had 240 fields, most of them with generic names such as &quot;modifier_01&quot; and &quot;modifier_02&quot;. This was an organization that was looking for the flexibility offered by MongoDB, but they tried to cram that flexibility into a relational database, and they did so by ignoring all the relational features offered by MySql. This &quot;one size fits all&quot; database table did not work for the last assignment I was given: import all the old FileMaker Pro databases to a system running Mysql/PHP/Symfony. I build an entirely different project, with its own database and schema. Lord knows who is maintaining it now.<p>Then I worked a year (2011-2012) at Shermans Travel, <a href=""http://www.shermanstravel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shermanstravel.com/</a> , which also tore apart its database. When I first arrived they were trying to save a system built with MySql and PHP and later forced to conform to the CakePHP framework. The database had over 300 tables, many of which were no longer in use. Of the tables that were in use, many had fields that were no longer in use. The code, and the database, were a sprawling mess, that had evolved chaotically. (I am emphasizing this chaos because this criticism is often made of MongoDB: without a schema then how do you keep your data organized? Well, most of the places I have worked have had relational databases where the data was completely disorganized). After a few months, the CTO and the tech team decided on a complete re-write of the code. The tech team was allowed to vote for either Java or Python or Ruby (no one wanted to use PHP). We voted for Ruby. We rebuilt the site as 6 apps, using MySql for some of the apps and MongoDB for some. My last big project there was a rescue effort for a broken group of 4 database tables in MySql. There was a &quot;users_history&quot; table that was suppose to track whether a user had subscribed or unsubscribed to various newsletters we offered, but there had been a bug, apparently for years, such that many of the &quot;unsubscribe&quot; attempts were not recorded. There were 3 other tables with somewhat redundant data, and I wrote a script that scanned those other 3 tables and attempted to funnel the correct data to the 4th table.<p>I have many more stories like this. I could write a whole book about places where Oracle, MySql or PostGre was in use, but the data was badly organized. Unused tables and unused fields are extremely common.<p>Why do I emphasize the chaos I have encountered? Because the charge of badly organized data gets thrown at MongoDB a lot. If you would like to read a scathing attack against MongoDB, read this:<p><a href=""http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never...</a><p>But to me, this line of argument compares the platonic ideal of relational data against the actual use of MongoDB. Maybe if Edgar F. Codd designed your schema to the 7th Normal Form then your schema really is well organized, but I have not seen anything like this in real life.<p>What I have seen, in real life, convinces me that every organization has an informal schema that is constantly evolving, and which can not be maintained with anything like regularity. Most of the organizations I&#x27;ve been hired at default to rebuilding everything every 5 or 6 years, because by that point the old system has grown chaotic. Sarah Mei&#x27;s description of the dangers of MongoDB matches my own experience with relational databases: &quot;we figured out that we had accidentally chosen a cache for our database.&quot;<p>What I like about MongoDB is it openly, boldly declares that the chaos I&#x27;ve seen is typical, and it facilitates the evolution of the schema which is going to happen no matter what you do or say. Things evolve, often chaotically. A programmer has a great idea and works on it in 2007, another programmer takes over in 2008, the project starts as raw PHP, later is imported into Symfony, then is re-written in Ruby, then it is broken up into several small apps. Someone quits. The CTO is fired. Someone new starts working and, for the sake of simplicity, prefers doing as much as possible as a background task, using cron scripts. A year later someone joins and is disgusted with the profusion of cron scripts, they want everything organized around a message queue. A very good sysadmin joins the team at a time when most of the programmers are weak, the sysadmin re-writes many of the background scripts, but he prefers Perl for everything and he implements some data caching strategies that no one understands.<p>You may think that I am exaggerating the level of chaos I have seen. I have not worked for Facebook or Google or Apple and if you tell me that in those companies everything is well run and well organized, then I will believe you, as I have no reason to doubt you. But I have worked at a lot of older media companies in New York City, and what I have seen is constant churn, churn at every level, churn in the team, churn in the technologies, and churn in the database.<p>I know I will be misunderstood, so let me try to clarify this:<p>I am not saying that chaos is good.<p>I am not saying that MongoDB is good because it encourages chaos.<p>I am saying that chaos is a symptom of the fact that most businesses do not know what their schema should be, and even if they did know what their schema should be, their needs would be different a year from now. The real schema needs of the organization (that is, what sets of data should be acquired and what the relations should be between those sets) are undergoing constant evolution, and this evolution is necessary, healthy, and unstoppable.<p>What is the strength of a relational system? Consider Wikipedia&#x27;s explanation of Codd&#x27;s Theorem:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd</a><p>&quot;The domain independent relational calculus queries are precisely those relational calculus queries that are invariant under choosing domains of values beyond those appearing in the database itself. That is, queries that may return different results for different domains are excluded. An example of such a forbidden query is the query &quot;select all tuples other than those occurring in relation R&quot;, where R is a relation in the database. Assuming different domains, i.e., sets of atomic data items from which tuples can be constructed, this query returns different results and thus is clearly not domain independent.&quot;<p>Clearly, this assumes that the relations among the data are known. The organizations that I work with have no real idea about what relations they want to establish among their data. They are in a permanent exploratory phase. I believe these organizations could be described as &quot;pre Codd&quot;, but most of them have been &quot;pre Codd&quot; for decades, and they will always be &quot;pre Codd&quot;. If you force them to specify relations among their data, you will get answers exactly as useful as these:<p><a href=""http://blog.jimmyr.com/Funny_student_Exam_Answers_13_2008.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jimmyr.com/Funny_student_Exam_Answers_13_2008.ph...</a><p>MongoDB is useful in this context. Start acquiring data. Don&#x27;t pretend you know what your schema is. You do not know what your schema is. The schema is changing all the time anyway.<p>Is there a place for relational databases? Yes, because sometimes some parts of the business become steady for some length of time, and for that part of the business, capturing fixed sets of data, with fixed relations, is very useful. But we should not pretend that this situation holds where it does not. I am not convinced that this is even the general case, though there is an overwhelming tendency in computer science, and in business, to pretend that fixed-sets-with-fixed-relations is the general case. If you feel it is, then you have been working at places facing conditions far more steady than what I have seen, or perhaps you are simply considering a shorter time frame than I am.",1395505284

If I say, for example (as I have on HN and gotten flack for) that women tend to be more likely to think in ways which are socially more complex than men, I get flack because there is a fear that anything essentialist about gender (outside of, say, the abortion debate) is essentially a way of trying to imprison women in limiting gender roles.  That isn&#x27;t my intention naturally but I have to accept that this is the framework behind the controversy that saying something like that arises.<p>Similarly if I argue that the natural order is for people to retire with their children, this has huge impacts for modern ideas of sexuality and the choice of childlessness.<p>There are tons of attitudes that I think that I would be cautious (though perhaps I am too foolish to be reluctant) about discussing.

The word &quot;endorse&quot; symbolizes something different than &quot;substantial and not nasty&quot;. It symbolizes subjective support, agreement. Because of this association, the use of this system will tend to signal that groupthink is valued, and a cycle of groupthink will become entrenched.<p>The fix is simple: use a different symbol. Something that more precisely, objectively signifies &quot;not simple and not nasty&quot;. This will create a more permissive gate that allows opinions of moderate substance and moderate tone through (an &quot;err on the side of allow&quot; policy). Inevitably the symbol must also consider the tendency of moderators, being active participants in a discussion themselves, to favor their own views.<p>Taken all into account, I suggest the &quot;endorse&quot; link be renamed &quot;tolerable&quot;. (Rather than an action, it becomes a kind of flag.) This has the explicit connotation of erring toward permissiveness of differing views, and contrasts the two fears expressed in the post: comments that are boring or unprofessional/spiteful/mean.<p>(And as it stands, upvoting already signifies &quot;endorsement&quot;.)",1395504817

Firstly, because I didn&#x27;t go to slashdot nearly as often as I do here, and secondly, because I haven&#x27;t done anything to thoroughly define and measure what I would consider a quality community.<p>If my problem is that the community is bad, I think I need a way to show to myself that it really is.  I need a set of guidelines which I want my community to interact according to, or standards for the goodness I&#x27;m trying to push, and a way to see how much goodness there is, then a plan to drive that goodness.<p>And I&#x27;m not even saying that you need to be rigorous about it.  Maybe that would help, but I think you can get some ideas with some general notions like tiny surveys, or something like that.

You truly think that so many experienced database professionals and software developers speak out about the dangers of using it solely to be &quot;cool&quot;?<p>You really don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with the numerous serious technical deficiencies it suffers from?

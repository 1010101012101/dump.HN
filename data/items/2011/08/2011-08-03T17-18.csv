With those companies perpetually encroaching on our privacy and the freedom of the internet, such leverage would be really good to have.<p>Just a few quick notes on unions in general:<p>1. Even though union membership and participation is covered under the NLRA, companies break the law all the time. Organizers are fired and retaliated against for union activity all the time. The fact is that the labor board (the government body that arbitrates labor disputes) is too weak and the penalties for breaking labor laws for companies too lax that it is often work the small amount of hassle for a company to break a union illegally. This has been shown in many, many union recognition struggles. Because of this, a unions power is not through the laws that ""protect"" it, but in the ability of its member to take action and force the company to meet demands, financially and socially.<p>2. Assuming the first point, we must have a discussion to determine where exactly our power can be exerted. Your idea of the ""kill switch"" is right on; essentially, if a company stiffs a developer, the internet as we all know it could shut down temporarily.<p>3. There are really bad ass unions out there that are in to organizing groups of workers that other unions deem ""unorganizable"". Developers, I would think, are one such group, considering our geographic and occupational spread. One such union is the IWW (iww.org). I'm a member, and would really strongly encourage affiliating with them.<p>4. Actually, I think solidarity with the Foxconn workers in China might be a good first campaign.<p>So, yeah, I really love this idea and am willing to do the work to make it happen.

He's one of the few people at the sweet spot on the Venn diagram ""personality is a force of nature"" and ""would gladly spend time hanging out with.""<p>On the specific topic of getting a job in Japan: if this is really your goal in life, star the part where it becomes 100,000x easier to do this after you have some ""in"" in Proper Japanese Society (TM).  If you are a force of nature like Jason is, then you'll end up getting one sometime between landing and convincing the Prime Minister's secretary that he should be having tea with you.  You can do it in meek-friendly ways, or I never would have managed it.  (I applied to an exchange program, got placed as a translator, and used a happy client as an introduction into the wonderful word of salarymandom.  So that's a route.  There might also be one that passes through the river Styx, in which case, use that one instead.  But there are definitely options.)<p>Key take away, though: like Jason says, virtually anything you can possibly do here is more effective than the halfhearted typical resume spray-and-pray from abroad that most people who say they want a job in Japan do.  Resume spray-and-pray is a terrible idea in general, but it's terrible-squared in the particular circumstance ""foreigner wants a job at a Japanese company"" because of the way gatekeepers work here.<p>BTW: You can get status in Proper Japanese Society (TM) by working for a high-status organization outside the country which you can convince to lateral you over to Tokyo.  Think of a massively high-status US organization: they probably have dealings in Tokyo.  There are a variety of ways to convince them to send you to Japan.  One fairly straightforward one is to know more Japanese than you can find printed on a sushi menu, which will catapult you ahead of 99.8% of their US employees for that opportunity.  The specifics of how to do this and how hard it would be depend on the organization: I have heard of places where Tokyo is considered a hardship post and have heard of places where Tokyo is considered the kind of place you kick butt and take names for a career to get a stint in.  (And would have had ZERO luck identifying those prior to hearing anecdotes from inside.  Sorry, can't identify them without breaking confidences.)",1312391111

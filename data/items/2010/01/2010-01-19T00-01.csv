1061189,comment,1060162,1060162,0,0,chreko,,,"I am struggling with that same problem since I started my first job after graduation. For many times I had the feeling to have sacrificed myself and my personal interest for my career (= someoneelse).<p>Only recently, I realized that this was a good experience nevertheless, but which has to stop now. It was good because it made it clear to me, what my preferences were as well as my strength and weaknesses. In other words who I am. Now I am <i>taking</i> my time for <i>my</i> interests (meditation, art and self-consciousness). This leads me to the following main messages as answer to your questions:<p>1.) You need to learn what you really want from life. And this, like every learning process, takes time and detours.<p>If you want to learn technology-related stuff, then you chances are pretty high that you may find an employee that is willing to give you freedom for personal projects, where you can learn and experience on your own (i.e. google's ""Innovation Time Off""). If this isn't possible where you are now, then you may consider looking for another job where you can bargain this as part of your contract.<p>If, instead, we are talking about learning for personal growth or ""self education"" as Ixiaus wrote, then it becomes really interesting. Here I agree with Ixiaus. One way is to make some sacrifices for what you really want to do: e.g. earning less money but having more time for ""self education"". If your are ready for that, then look for a part-time job indeed, or build-up a sustainable startup were you don't have to make millions a year and report to a venture capitalist, but instead where earning some $10k is enough.<p>2.) Admit and be aware of your weaknesses. Several times, I find myself blaming myself for not being able to do this or to do that in the way and speed I wish it to be done. And when I have the time, I sometimes find myself spending that rare time with whatever.<p>But this is ok, as long as I continue working on my self, gradually improving the conscience use of my time. In particular, consider this: 6 hours of deep sleep are enough. This gives me some extra hours in the early morning and/or late evening for practising whatever I want to (meditation and yoga). Discipline is key, I always have to remember!<p>3.) The more dependent you are (the more money you want or believe to need or need), the less time you will have for ""self education"".<p>The dependencies can come from difference sources: your employees, your venture capitalist, your customers, your spouse, your children, ...., your expectations. Each of those relationships are chains around your neck. One first need to be aware of them, not imperatively avoid them. Then one can gently work towards reducing those dependencies, if one wishes to do so.",1263861711

1061183,comment,1060477,1061081,0,0,camccann,,,"That's not what credit scores are <i>for</i> though.<p>Imagine that you're going to be lending money with interest. What does your ideal customer look like? Someone who just pays you back a month later? No, because you're not getting much interest from them. Someone who has trouble making payments? No, too much risk of losing what you lend. Ideally, you want someone who consistently carries debt and pays it off slowly.<p>There's also the matter of ""handling debt well"" not being the same thing as ""general financial responsibility"". While you might <i>intend</i> to pay it back quickly, that's not something the lender can just assume, and if you've never carried significant debt over a period of time they can't judge how you'll react if (for some reason) you can't pay it off quickly as you intended.<p>There's also the issue of wondering <i>why</i> someone who's rarely carried debt wants credit--what changed to make them need it, and how does that impact the risk of lending to them?<p>Short version: credit scores aren't really about <i>you</i> personally. They're about roughly estimating whether lending money to you would be profitable.",1263861414

1061168,comment,1059985,1060548,0,0,Mz,,,"No sweat.  I've just read a lot about women's issues over the years and I think it very often gets short shrift.  Even if women are 'more arrogant and self aggrandizing' or 'better at overcoming impostor syndrome'...or whatever the issue is here... That whole baby-bearing thing tends to trip them up.  I've been close to some women who didn't initially have any particular plans to settle down and have kids and were all too happy to pursue life in a man's world on the terms offered.  They did very well -- until they had a baby.  Then it all came crashing down and they wound up enormously frustrated with their lives and bewildered at their inability to escape the fate of so many women that they thought for a time they had already escaped.<p>In contrast, European women have generally faired better than American women.  Historically, they didn't fight for ""rights"".  Instead, they worked for support and assistance for the burden of bearing and raising their kids.  Getting that has allowed women in some European countries to close the wage gap to some extent and to do a better job of balancing career and family.  They also generally have more family support and lower divorce rates.  The typical historical American attitude of ""Don't tread on me"" (and the general F... You attitude that goes with it) works okay until you have a baby and then <i>need</i> community support of some sort.  Then bitchy positions about not needing a man (or anyone else) suddenly don't work so well.<p>Um, I'll just stop here.  Consider it a pet topic of mine.  Okay? :)",1263860638

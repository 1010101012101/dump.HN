7851960,comment,7850849,7850849,3,0,wrongc0ntinent,,,"The painting analogy isn&#x27;t really warranted, and this article is a metaphor at best. You could replace painting with poetry, music, or building furniture. There are a few definitions of painting, and there&#x27;s lots of art being made that plays at pushing those definitions, so I can&#x27;t claim to have the definitive one. However, essential things, such as the interface (which is in no small part responsible for the content of a painting), and the actual final product as object, are very, very different. A medium is also defined by its constraints, and from code to screen or printout the constraints of image-making are unlike anything you have in painting.<p>Generative art is beautiful, but not because it has anything to do with painting.<p>Edit: If this seems harsh, it&#x27;s because I care about code just as much as I do about painting. Using any one of them as a catch-all for stereotypes is intellectually lazy (and often irritating).",1401976596

7851940,comment,7850849,7851766,2,0,tomek_zemla,,,"It&#x27;s a fascinating discussion. Maybe we can meet half way?<p>> I definitely believe that there is value in artists learning to think with the rigor that code encourages. It&#x27;s a fascinating cross-pollination...<p>I agree!<p>> Design is remarkably accessible...<p>But this... Well it depends on the point of view. Design can be as intimidating for geeks as programming is for artists.<p>I have nothing against making programming tools more user or artist friendly. In a sense Photoshop is such a step - it allows many creators make sophisticated images without learning to draw and without learning to program. And certainly many many amazing works were created with it and similar tools.<p>The point I am trying to make here is that the visual/artistic power or possibilities of generative art and design are very much driven and dependent on the artist&#x27;s fluency to program. There were many attempts to create programming tools [1] that let you avoid having to slog through typing the code, but seems like none of them would match the expressive possibilities of &#x27;raw&#x27; coding and gain any wider adoption. In other words all of them have significant limitations and this would be a step back from the point of view generative artist.<p>And just to make it clear, I don&#x27;t think that using any of these higher level tools is wrong or produces works of lesser value. It&#x27;s just that these works are outside of unique possibilities of generative art driven by traditional coding.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.interfacevision.com/design/design-visual-progarmming-languages-snapshots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.interfacevision.com/design/design-visual-progarm...</a>",1401976340

But as far as creating a suite of business applications is concerned -- biggest problem I see is developers not knowing how to control WebSphere (auto-deploy, auto re-admin) which seems to be cultural rather than an issue with the software.<p>And FYI to all those complaining about the &quot;send a jar to IBM?!!&quot; scenario you should realize that sending around WARs/EARs is pretty commonplace in the java world. it&#x27;s kindof like zipping a certain git commit, for all you dynamic folks.

People already think of it as &quot;Apple&#x27;s language&quot; and it&#x27;s true that the vast majority of developments come from there, but I believe it to be more than that thanks to GNUstep.<p>When I learned objc more than a decade ago I was really just a kid, I could not afford a Mac or any extra hardware. But there was a GNU compiler. GNUstep had an open implementation of Foundation and AppKit. And the whole thing ran on Linux. So I was able to play with it. When I share this story with current objc devs, they give me blank looks. Mentally, they have already decided it is Apple&#x27;s language and nothing more.

Any method, even if utterly broken but that takes 2 days to decipher is fine for such a thing. Many things do not need &quot;forever&quot; level security.<p>On the medium - even if they had told the Japanese that they were using the Navajo language (in this case, other American languages in other cases), it is reportedly very difficult to learn, so if we take that at face value - it would still provide a long buffer before it became insecure. The time to train up enough people to have the messages useful on the battle coordination timelines is still long. The extra bit of making the Japanese figure out what the heck the language was only added to the this timeline. Security by obscurity as a portion, not the key, to security is not a bad thing.<p>On the very long timeline - this is totally weak. But... most of those messages probably weren&#x27;t recorded anyway, it&#x27;s a very modern mindset to even consider the possibility - these voice transmissions are truly ephemeral, there just wasn&#x27;t the recording technology at the time for the scale needed. Besides, there were other ciphers for textual communications. Even if there was the recording technology, it would aid in the Japanese figuring out that it was navajo, and perhaps aid in training up the people to decipher it faster, but see above.<p>So basically if they had kept the use of these guys&#x27; Navajo language transmissions to things that had a &quot;keep secret&quot; timeline that was relatively short, it was pretty secure for that use.<p>There are lots of interesting meta analyses in this sort of thing, but that is true no matter what the cipher.",1401975785

I&#x27;ve also gone through the bodybuilding &quot;bulking/cutting&quot; cycle that was popular for so long (and maybe still is, I don&#x27;t do that anymore), so I&#x27;m quite familiar with gaining 20-30lbs and cutting down again in cycles.

I think it&#x27;s easy for people who have by now built an intuitive grasp of code to appreciate how challenging tools like Processing can be for a beginner.<p>I have a design background and learned front end code (and eventually ruby on rails) by getting progressively more interested in how the things I was designing were built. I feel like I achieved a pretty respectable level of knowledge in what I had been exposed to.<p>And yet, many aspects of Processing were a huge leap for me. I spent days looking at code examples just to try and grok how 3D works in processing. I get it now (mostly), but it still feels unintuitive. I can certainly imagine a language that would describe 3D behavior, and a whole host of other things, in a way that a visual artist would describe them.<p>I definitely believe that there is value in artists learning to think with the rigor that code encourages. It&#x27;s a fascinating cross-pollination. Creativity often springs from encountering the limits of a medium (and one&#x27;s mastery of the medium).<p>But look at the excitement this week among people like me about Swift. It&#x27;s not about whether it was <i>possible</i> before for me to learn Objective C and build a game. It was. But goddamnit, it&#x27;s such a pain, and I would certainly understand that someone who is starting from zero in terms of CS knowledge would find it impossibly intimidating.<p>Design is remarkably accessible. If you can pick up a pen and paper, you can do it. Code is getting way closer to that, but let&#x27;s not have collective Stockholm syndrome. Our tools are a long way away from where they could be.<p>Honestly, I wish I had the skills to write a language or build the tools like the ones I can imagine myself. But I have confidence that someone will. It&#x27;s going to be an exciting time for art, and I think it&#x27;s coming very soon.",1401974312

I have not tried to share memory (ex: a pointer-to-struct) between two different go threads before, so I can&#x27;t really comment on what happens when one tries to break out of the language&#x27;s philosophy. However, I&#x27;ve found that following the philosophy is incredibly liberating as it encourages a certain kind of reasoning that gives me the confidence I can accurately statically analyze the code without having to debug it at run time. Like any other philosophy though, it isn&#x27;t for everyone.<p>EDIT: I now realize I never addressed your concern of primitives. Go really only has one: the channel. It can send anything (even other channels). The two types are buffered or unbuffered, and deciding which to use can alter the behavior of a program.<p>There are a few language keywords to support the use of channels, such as `for-select-case` loops and `go` to spawn new goroutines. The former is used to help respond to numerous channels, the latter to spawn more goroutines. Nothing in the language prevents listening to a runtime-determined arbitrary number of channels, either.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.golang.org/share-memory-by-communicating"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.golang.org/share-memory-by-communicating</a>",1401974268

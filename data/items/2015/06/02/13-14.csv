Insulin, and the polio vaccine I can see in that category...  But there have been so many drugs like Avastin (which sadly I had personal experience with through my wife&#x27;s cancer,  which were supposed to be breakthroughs.. miracles etc... Yet, when the dust settled and more data beyond the initial company reported data came to light, it extended life expectancy by very little time.... Our oncologist was pretty good about holding expectations in check.  But if we went by the company&#x27;s claims, we would have been sadly disappointed through false hope, as well as the VAST majority of people who took Avastin. Or Erbitux was another.  It was offered to my wife as an option... The pharma gloss used all sorts of superlatives, yet for her cancer, it would have given her an extra few <i>weeks</i> based on some of the studies we were able to dig up.

Edge-to-edge beautiful photos sliding by your screen throughout the day was one of the key ideas of making Flume - it wasn&#x27;t important to me who posted a photo or how many likes and comments it had - for me it was about the photo. That&#x27;s what inspired the feed view. Of course, Instagram is a social network, so those details are still available for you there if you want them, but the idea was to highlight photography, not followers.<p>While working on Flume for Mac, I discovered an opportunity to give a smaller but still beautiful Instagram experience to people who don&#x27;t have a Mac and for those that didn&#x27;t want to browse via an app. I open hundreds of tabs a day and I don&#x27;t want to go to my phone to check my Instagram feed, and that&#x27;s where Flume New Tab was born. Available now for Safari and Chrome, you can bring some beauty to your blank tabs!<p>Flume for Mac is currently in beta and I&#x27;m taking some limited testers on board - Instagrammers are obviously preferred. Get in touch on the website to let me know.<p>If you&#x27;re curious about the name - since it&#x27;s shared with a famous musician - flume is an old English word that means a river or stream. When new items photo pop into the Mac app, it feels like a drop of water in a stream.<p>Thanks and happy browsing!",1433253413

Electronics designed to run off AA batteries already extract as much energy as is practical from them. From those discharge curves you can see that there is a gentle downward-sloping section, followed by a distinct &quot;knee&quot; at the end where the voltage falls rapidly. That is where the gadget would be designed to work down to.<p>Sure there&#x27;s a few percent more beyond that, but adding a boost converter which attempts to extract that energy won&#x27;t work - the boost converter itself will be consuming energy, and likely far more than is available past the knee, so this device could actually <i>reduce</i> how long your batteries last!<p>As for the miniaturisation - this isn&#x27;t that small; similar boosters have been present in MP3 players, cellphones, and other battery-powered electronics for years. Fitting everything on a PCB with the diameter of an AA and less than 1mm thick is not that hard. Look at the ISL9113A for one example. I haven&#x27;t laid out a boost converter in a design with that space constraint, but it turns out to be roughly of that area anyway and I&#x27;m sure if you did things like cutouts to sit the passives into the board, it&#x27;ll be thin enough.",1433252965

Although I know of at least one person who turned millionaire after bootstrapping by maxing out his credit cards, I would never suggest doing that.  It&#x27;s a deep hole to climb out of if you fail and for every success story, there&#x27;s probably 100 failures not talked about.  In short, the successes I&#x27;ve seen involve buying advertising to get people to a landing page that generates leads with commissions that (hopefully) pay you back more than you spend getting the traffic.  It&#x27;s a delicate operation that pays well only if you get the landing page and affiliate choices right.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen wealth generated with mailing lists.  This is another affiliate marketing play that can be done without feeling too spammy and can still add value to the user.<p>Similar to a mailing list, a forum can be easy to set up and maintain.  Also like a mailing list, if you create a large enough user base, advertising can pay off.<p>One of the better earners is a subscription model for just about anything.  Software provided for free with a &quot;premium&quot; set of features for $x per month is a good way to generate a user base more easily.<p>A couple things to keep in mind:\n1.

Other chip lines are similarly affected: I remember from my youth tinkering with assembly language there being a bug in some 6502&#x27;s that meant inirect jumps referencing the last byte of a page would not work as expected.<p>But the FDIV bug came to attention around the time when CPUs were first being marketted directly at end users rather than PC makers ina big way (as the next phase of the battle you mention in the i486 era), with the man on the street suddenly being aware that they might be able to make the value choice between the alternatives. That is in part why the Pentium line got a name instead of just a code/number (80586, i586, ...): Intel found they couldn&#x27;t stop people using a number directly in their product names which would have made it harder to differentiate their products from the competition (of course the workaround for this that everyone used was to call their alternative chips &quot;pentium class&quot;).

But you can be aware of it and compensate for it, if you make the truth (and, by extension, <i>actually being right</i>) your highest goal. Just throwing your hands in the air and giving up, seems to me equivalent to saying &quot;everyone has biases, the best way to avoid them is to not think&quot;.<p>That said, obviously I am not suggesting that you just form opinions before you know <i>anything</i>. The example given was a chess position. The OP knew enough about chess that he could have picked a side had he taken time to examine the position well. If he had initially chosen black, but white was the stronger, he could have perhaps reached this conclusion after evaluating black&#x27;s position a little more carefully. Then he could update his opinion to prefer white. But he did none of that, because he didn&#x27;t care enough to form any opinion at all, <i>even though he had enough information to do so</i>.<p>> <i>That&#x27;s a false dichotomy.</i><p>Ugh, yes okay if taken absolutely literally, yes it is a false dichotomy.

Bury in there an API that returns your copyright if called in just the right way (But don&#x27;t tell anyone about this.) Write up a license to give the company you wrote the code for a limited license to use the code. Specify that they cannot sublicense the code to anyone else without prior permission but they can use it for their product/site you built it for.  The license should explicitly say you reserve all rights.<p>Then you can hand over the source. If this agency then takes that source and uses it elsewhere then they are violating the license.<p>There&#x27;s not much you can do to prevent this, but you can access the API described earlier to get your copyright notice from the code, so if they don&#x27;t catch and remove it you can prove they are using your code.<p>Getting a lawyer to write up such a contract would be convenient, but in absent of one you can write a license in plain terms setting out the agreement.  Get the company you give the license to to sign it as part of turning over the source code.<p>Lawyers are best for covering everything that could go wrong, but if you can&#x27;t afford one, a written agreement will cost you nothing and offer at least some protection later.<p>Of course, the best advice is always to get a lawyer.

In all cases they get primary custody of the children even if they have drug issues and walk away with substantial income.  80% of divorces in the US are initiated by the woman.  This leaves men impoverished and unable to interract with their own children.

I can say this from direct experience working with a team that was all &quot;independent&quot; but were taking a draw to work on CoOp projects (we didn&#x27;t call it a CoOp but that is what it was). We were constantly juggling priorities more so than if those same team members were full time.  Making a deadline was nearly impossible because people each had their own competing priorities.  Managing client expectations was nearly impossible because you couldn&#x27;t predict what anyones schedules were, and frankly I don&#x27;t feel they were being honest with me or really even themselves.  Mind you I don&#x27;t feel any of the people were evil or bad people or I would never have worked with them, but we all have priorities and needs that we will serve first.  And if your priority is putting food on the table for the family then you might be more inclined to work for $125/hr with a direct client rather then a CoOp client were you personally might only take in $85/hr (the rest going to support sales & management efforts of the CoOp etc) or where you are working on a product and there is no revenue yet.<p>CoOps to me are not effective for a development team or as a consulting group.  You either have dedication from the group or you don&#x27;t, and splitting their attention never seems to be effective.  The idea that someone will spend 2 weeks out of a month on CoOp work and 2 Weeks on personal Client. Or 2 days a week on CoOp and 3 on Client or whatever split someone tells themselves is only good until the first client call or broken code that needs fixed now.  Then stuff just changes.<p>As for your personal situation, good for you to recognize and be honest with yourself about your abilities.  But I have to think with 4 years of experience either you are better than you are saying in which case you are under valued; or you aren&#x27;t getting larger concepts and need mentoring and/or training.  Or maybe development just isn&#x27;t for you.  But no matter which it is, you have to be realistic that joining a CoOp or trying to consult requires solid skills, time management and in general a network that you can use to help get work.",1433250129

I said &quot;When PC&#x27;s come out with type-C, they&#x27;ll have multiple ports, but you&#x27;ll only be able to use one of them as the power port.   Apple would rather have a single port than have such a confusing setup.&quot;<p>Of course, then the Chromebook Pixel came out and proved me wrong.

Well, then I guess it would depend on if I thought you went through bankruptcy because you started a company without a corporation and it crashed, or if I thought you went through bankruptcy for personal reasons.   The latter, in my mind, would pretty much disqualify you, as it suggests you are not good with money.<p>The former is just fine, assuming you can get me to believe you.  (but convincing me of this would be difficult. Everyone with a shopping problem would like to think they were really 'investing' Financial records from the failed company would help a lot, and would provide evidence you are good with money.)<p>Of course, I invest in my own companies, not in other people's companies, so my opinion may not be representative.<p>Oh, also, especially if you are young, it will matter a lot less as you get older.   We all can relate to doing irresponsible things when we were young.",1225252093

347102,comment,346858,346858,0,0,lsc,,,"physical access is root access...  I don't think renting virtual servers (what you are doing with ec2, at least)  is inherently any less secure than renting a physical server.  Either way, if I am the provider, and I am willing to do unethical things to your server, I can.<p>Virtualization makes this slightly easier, but it's certainly possible on physical servers.   If you are co-locating your own hardware, I only need to fake one crash to give myself root.  If you are renting a server, well, it's easy enough to trojan the image I give you.<p>Like most of the 'cloud computing' hype, these problems have been around for a while.   'cloud computing'  seems an awful lot like 'what we have been doing all along, only faster and in a standard manner'   Not that it's not awesome,  but I'm just saying that the problems are not new.<p>(unless you mean application-level cloud computing like google app engine.  that's something different, with different concerns.   I was speaking of 'quick provisioning' clouds, or 'utility computing'  like amazon ec2)",1225251462

I mean, it would matter why, and it wouldn't be an immediate no any more than having a failed business would be an immediate no,  but it's a black mark.   The technical partner having that black mark?  especially if the technical partner had a business partner who was responsible (and who would presumably be responsible for the money) well, that wouldn't bother me so much.",1225250711

It was just announced that our presses are shutting down and our daily print edition will be printed on the presses of our mortal enemy that is no longer our mortal enemy (expect that to be a trend).<p>Newspapers are feeling inadequate compared to the Internet at large so they're starting to churn out more and more ""this just happened"" news.  Unfortunately, ""this just happened"" news is an easy-to-find commodity, so the strategy is doomed, IMHO.<p>I think newspapers should cancel their AP subscriptions and change their print editions almost entirely to what they call 'enterprise journalism' (answering the why's), and their online editions to local in-depth analysis.  I'm not sure I would bother with breaking news at all, to be frank.  There are too many other channels for that.<p>In short, I would leave the ""this just happened"" alone and focus on being the local Economist (which I've been saying before I ever read timtrueman's comment, which I completely agree with).",1225250670

You just have to make sure you pick wisely.<p>Arts education is a steal.  You can find classes with reasonably successful faculty.  I'm currently taking screenwriting at De Anza and enjoyed short fiction classes with Bob Bausch (<a href=""http://www.robertbausch.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robertbausch.org/</a>) back in Virginia.  With workshop-style classes, there can be wider variation in talent-levels and enthusiasm yet not be a show-stopper in helping you move forward with your skills.  These faculty can also be very accessible for personal review of your work.<p>Comp sci/programming is another story.  It'd be too frustrating to take courses at the CC level because of the pace, although even here, I can see a problem-based course accommodating different levels of skill and interest.<p>The availability of all these internet courses will make a dramatic impact to education.   I would have killed to have access to this stuff back in high school.

I agree that kernel size matters less than RAM usage.<p>But to share my perspective: My first computer was a ZX81, with 1K RAM total (i.e. 1024 bytes). 32*24=768 bytes were used for video in the worst case (it was compressed, newline style). To be fair, it didn't have a filesystem (no disks) or multitasking. In truth, I found 1K just too limiting, and went for the 16K rampack addon.<p>Regarding my main point: I doubt the massive software base can be given up at this point (even the disruptive technology of cell phones switch to linux when they get powerful enough) - it's just my yearning for those days of daring frugality, when a byte was worth fighting for.",1225249370

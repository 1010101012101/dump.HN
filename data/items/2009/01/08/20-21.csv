Each OS has one, and it is standard, comes with a bunch of tools, is familiar to users. Thus I just don't get why Microsoft felt the need for implementing yet another proprietary FS (registry), especially when it's inferior to NTFS or Ext3 in every way, including security, reliability and performance. Perhaps it made sense in FAT/Win16 days.<p>But I hear you, good tools can be misused and bad ones can be improved upon",1231448256

425616,comment,425177,425392,0,0,timf,,,"What does reputation have to do with anything?  I'm not saying the lockout would be based on an IP database but rather the # of attempts would be scoped by the IP address it was originating from.  At some point you could completely lock out attempts from that IP.  Sorry if that was unclear.<p>This means that there in almost all cases the IP used by the bona fide customer would not be in locked out mode or in exponentially backing off mode yet.<p>I understand relying on different IPs is not going to work <i>100% of the time</i>, spoofing and NATs etc. are a (small) problem in this scheme.  In such cases, the ""locked out"" message will be displayed and the bona fide user will get his email anyhow.  (I guess if the attacker was just trying to be annoying to someone, he could hit the 'locked out' button over and over again, is that the point you are trying to make?)<p>What I am saying is that I do not want the user to have to bother with resetting their password until the last moment.  The fact that this is not a ""bulletproof"" solution is not an issue.  Getting things down to <i>much less likely</i> is a win in this case because it means the customer's experience has been enhanced (or rather, has <i>not</i> been un-enhanced).<p><i>""The sites that are going to get targeted are the ones that don't do lockout. The ones that do will be worthless, except to get your bots killed.""</i><p>I don't get the reasoning here.  I want a system that both discourages getting specifically targetted like you are saying -- but also one that has a contingency plan if there is an attack.<p>What we seem to be disagreeing about is the contents of that contingency plan?  You want a simple one and I want one that will try to avoid the customer needing to even know there was a problem if possible.",1231447985

They need not only to <i>fix</i> Vista but to add improvements. The ones they <i>are</i> adding still mostly fall into the Leopard blanket of feature, with the exception of the patently bizarre ""half-window"" feature. Apple, meanwhile, is calling Snow Leopard a speed tweak: they're reducing filesize, adding Exchange support, and improving their Quicktime codecs for native filetype support. In other words, they're closing the window and removing vulnerabilities. Everybody thinks Apple has the superior featureset, and if they're also faster and sturdier and have business support, then they have a legitimate chance of getting the vast upper hand here.<p>I think Microsoft is learning from their mistakes, but they're learning slowly. It'll take them a long time to clean out the muckiness of their operating system and create something as minimal as OS X. And, from what I've seen of Windows 7, they're still not going at it the  right way.",1231447737

425544,comment,425483,425483,0,0,mdasen,,,"I agree with the article for the most part.  People like to think they're special because of their ideas, but ideas are easy to come by.  It's partly why I hated doing projects for friends as an undergrad.  They'd think, I have this amazing idea that's going to become huge on the internet and really just need a trained monkey to translate idea into a functioning web property.  The problem is that they'd have an idea like, ""create a website where bands could upload music and users could listen for free and bands would get a cut of the ad revenue!"" and then everything beyond that was my problem.  Even something as simple as a name couldn't be chosen because they couldn't implement even simple things.  Better yet were the people who had just ""stolen"" an already implemented idea (say, eBay) describe it and then at the end casually say, ""kinda like eBay"" as if that wasn't something I knew existed.  Then when I ask, well, how should the reputation system be implemented (positive only, wait a week after each has entered their feedback to display, require some feedback or the user themselves gets neg feedback as a non-feedback provider, auto-extend auctions so that there's at least a minute after the final bid before it closes to prevent sniping. . .) they'd be clueless.  Those were my problems.  They had an idea!<p>However, sometimes people do what I would consider stealing of ideas.  For example, you and a friend start creating mockups and going through the interactions and then he decides to take that and go his own way.  Then again, I guess the author would probably classify that as design and implementation rather than idea.<p>Truly, what is patentable should be very small.  Discoveries, ideas and business models are not the implementation of an invention.  Likewise, it must be an implementation.  For example (since the History channel always seems to have stuff about this), if you come up with a way that a gun pushes the next bullet into the chamber and pulls back the hammer, fine.  If you say, I want to patent a gun that automatically gets the gun ready for the next bullet, not fine. In the first, you've done a specific thing - there might be more than one way to do it and you've developed a specific fashion.  In the second, you're just saying that it could be done through some method you haven't implemented anything.",1231445590

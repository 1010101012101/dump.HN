7811763,comment,7807676,7809483,1,0,logfromblammo,,,"A while ago, I daydreamed the possibility that some government could, by way of international competitive advantage, establish by law a favorable tax situation for corporations that had a &quot;Gov Class&quot; stock.  This would represent no less than 10%  of the total ownership interest, and would be proxyless and nonvoting, but would have preferred treatment for dividends.  Any distributions to Gov Class shareholder would be deductable from any taxes otherwise owed to it, but would not be refundable.<p>That would allow the government, or anyone in its federation or confederation or otherwise under it in the hierarchy, to invest in startup businesses in such a way that favors local development and limits tax jurisdiction shopping.<p>If Chicago bought 15% of a new local company as Gov Class shares, it retains 15% of the value of the company and 15% of the profits, at the expense of tax revenues, even if the company moves to San Francisco.  In that case, taxes would ordinarily drop to nothing, but as a stockholder, the municipal government retains its investment.  But perhaps the State of California buys out City of Chicago to sweeten the deal.  Chicago now has that money back to reinvest, instead of pissing away tax dollars to develop companies that just leave when they get big enough.<p>Of course, that assumes governments could be responsible investors, which is a proposition very difficult to prove.  As it is, straight subsidies seem like a far stupider and more bureaucratic way to just waste tax money and enrich business owners without producing the intended effects.  If the government is enriching the business owners anyway, wouldn&#x27;t it be more cost effective to actually <i>be</i> one of the owners?",1401299507

There has been no convenient, highly popular and supported language for development that also has best-of-breed performance. You can have one or the other. (Yes, I&#x27;ve probably heard of your obscure fast-as-C language that has a great web stack... to a first approximation, nobody else has.)<p>2. Web development languages have been profoundly, deeply single-threaded, to the point that the web world began to take it as an unmitigated virtue that a page started with a request, generated a response, and dropped everything in the world that it knew at the end of the request. State is something that must be managed carefully, but especially in this era of people writing web applications that may literally have <i>gigabytes</i> available per concurrent user (obviously, not <i>everybody</i>, but this is a non-trivial use case!), the statelessness dogma has seriously broken people&#x27;s mental models vs. what the hardware is actually capable of.<p>With Rust, you should be able to write fast, concurrent web applications that actually <i>do</i> something concurrently and aren&#x27;t constantly marshaling across requests for the client to re-initiate AJAX calls or other such silliness, it&#x27;ll be fast, and with its emphasis on memory safety, statically safe as well (something that you&#x27;re not going to get very easily out of Java, and certainly not from a programmer just sitting down and pounding out some Java). It isn&#x27;t going to be the solution to every problem, but it&#x27;s going to be the solution to more problems than people realize right now, because we&#x27;ve so deeply internalized our essentially-PHP models of how the web works that we can&#x27;t hardly even see how things ought to actually be working.<p>Rust isn&#x27;t the only language biting at this apple.

Instead, you can try and see how it fits into your business. If you see no fit or can&#x27;t get value, you can cut the loss and move on.

Public transportation really sucks in a lot of places precisely because making public transportation awesome gets less priority than a bunch of other things, like demanding that people get to bring their pets or bikes on board, or the homeless people using it as a place to sleep.<p>...<p>> Buses could be awesome, if they were managed like Google buses. I would love to take one of those to work. But look at all the grief they get from the left. Grand ideas for re-imagining society will face opposition from places you would never have imagined.<p>I think this is all a bit over the top. Many cities already exist that function very well substantially without private cars. Central London, although rather a pleasant place, is not a science fiction utopia exclusively filled with nubile twenty somethings, but nevertheless it functions overwhelmingly on other means of transport - buses, cycling, the underground, and taxis. I&#x27;m not aware of it being particularly unique, either. What you&#x27;re suggesting as difficult or intractable problems are frankly rather minor. Maybe I&#x27;m just lucky, but I&#x27;ve only ever come across the occasional over-chatty drunk.<p>Even taking into account the whole of London, including the much more suburban outer sections, where you really do need a car to get around, 40% of households do not own cars [1]<p>The real issue with public transport isn&#x27;t the homeless, it&#x27;s that it tends towards a hub and spokes model which works very well for commuting, but quickly becomes awkward for non-standard journeys. Driverless cars would add an excellent complementary element to the combined transport system. I expect that in a couple of decades the number of households that don&#x27;t own cars will have gone up to 60%, meaning pretty much universal in the centre, and I don&#x27;t anticipate that will create a dystopia.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.uncsbrp.org/driving.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uncsbrp.org/driving.htm</a>",1401298397

This may not be a big deal for small teams but if you want to have 100 users on either service, the difference is between $2,400 a year or $9,600 a year. That&#x27;s a big difference.\n2. Hipchat has a self hosted option in the works which should be available within a month or two (per them). This is essential for any company that deals with potential PHI on their IM systems. Slack says they plan to offer a self hosted option but it&#x27;s a long way out.<p>Those are two things slack just couldn&#x27;t overcome, beyond the fact that I generally liked slack better (it&#x27;s prettier, much better message searching, better integrations, etc).

I think many lurkers share my interest in the subject matter, but are storing it away as a data point to be considered in the future rather than a policy discussion generator now.<p>I&#x27;ve broken out of my normal mode in case you actually believe that HN&#x27;s general opinion on this technology is a consensus that entirely disagrees with you. Personally, I&#x27;m excited for the technology to become mature enough to become a consumer product, but I&#x27;m unlikely to remand control of my personal vehicle to automation if I don&#x27;t plan on drinking.<p>I know that retaining my vain control obsession over my vehicle will eventually make me one of the more dangerous vehicles on the road (as the share of quality autonomous vehicles increases in the future), and I know that I&#x27;ll buy one for my family (whenever that happens). Until my body fails me or I don&#x27;t have enough time to drive, I&#x27;m going to ride my motorcycle and drive my car myself, while sincerely encouraging literally everyone else to get an autonomous vehicle. I know that there will be others like me, and I know that these people will either evolve into very good drivers or angry teenagers. Regardless, the road will be safer for all, and our collective time will be less wasted on piloting tasks.<p>You&#x27;re not alone.<p>*EDIT I should note that I&#x27;m a U.S. resident.

This makes the payment tradeoff look a little different; the rationale for allowing the monthly payments is minimising friction that comes when potential clients start subjecting the cost to the greater scrutiny and level of paperwork that comes with higher up front amounts. Whether a stream of monthly payments starting NOW is better for your cashflow than a 12 month lump sum in approx two months&#x27; time depends a lot on the specifics of your startup.\nRegardless, it&#x27;s still worth offering the small annual payment discount for those that want it and trying to persuade existing monthly customers to switch.<p>I can&#x27;t fathom why any business, least of all a startup business, would consider &quot;annual post-pay&quot; as a payment option.",1401296876

But when I see significantly higher salaries in very specific geographical regions, what I see is one of two things: either people there tend to be more valuable than others, or they are demanding compensation for all the crap they have to put up with and/or purchase that they can get for free or at reduced cost elsewhere.<p>For instance, in Chicago, I had to pay an extra $100 a month for a parking space behind my apartment.  That&#x27;s $1200 a year already.  Never mind if you actually wanted to <i>go anywhere</i> in your car and park in the same ZIP code.  That costs you additional time and walking distance or additional cash.  And it certainly impacts your property and casualty insurance premiums.<p>Having grown up in a different city, where parking had never been an issue, that threw my own freedom of movement up in stark contrast, as something that had calculatable value to me, and which likely differed significantly from other people.  The costs of having a car in Chicago were only partially mitigated by having CTA and Metra commuter service.  Grocery shopping is a lot different when you can only buy what you are willing to carry in your arms for as long as it takes to get home.  You buy a lot less of the things that are mostly air (additional volume) or mostly water (additional weight).<p>That was but one of the reasons that I found the local pay was not worth the local costs, and moved.<p>For a variety of reasons, the people deciding on the location of a business do not value those local costs in the same way, and do not realize that their employees may demand more in compensation because of them.  Or they just don&#x27;t care.<p>As for myself, I could probably get 1.5x my current pay in SV or 2x in NYC.  But it would have to be 3-5x to be worth it.

It&#x27;s reasonable for, say, Settings to use private APIs, because it&#x27;s special. (I don&#x27;t <i>agree</i> with that, and would like third-party apps to be allowed to change that stuff too, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an unreasonable stance.)<p>However, this is iBooks, which you get from the App Store just like all third-party apps. It&#x27;s explicitly competing with products from third-party developers. In this area, there should be a level playing field.<p>When us third-party developers distribute on the App Store, we have to agree to a contract that, among other things, states that our apps will not use private APIs. Why do Apple&#x27;s apps, when distributed through the App Store, not follow the same rules? Why should they get special treatment for apps that aren&#x27;t built in to the OS and which are distributed using the same channels the rest of us use?<p>This popover example is fairly trivial, since nothing stops you from building your own version of it and shipping it in your app, but it illustrates the point. A more significant example is the screen brightness control. iBooks has a slider that you can use to adjust the brightness of the screen. This brightness adjustment uses private API, and because of that, other eBook readers cannot replicate that feature. There is no <i>technical</i> reason third-party apps couldn&#x27;t do this (they have the same access to the device that iBooks does) but Apple doesn&#x27;t allow it.<p>The Kindle app, for example, has a brightness slider too. Except it doesn&#x27;t adjust the screen brightness. It just adjusts the gray level of the white background, while leaving the backlight at original strength. This means that you lose contrast and use more battery power, meaning that the Kindle app is inherently worse because Apple isn&#x27;t playing fair.<p>This is less important these days, now that Control Center lets you easily access the device brightness from anywhere. It was a big hit against Kindle&#x27;s usability for years, though.",1401296420

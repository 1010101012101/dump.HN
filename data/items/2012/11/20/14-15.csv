And CS tends to be extremely rigorous, so I am honestly surprised that a recruiter would view a degree in CS from UTex as a non-indicator.<p>But I'm not trying to shoot the messenger.  Perhaps UTex and Brown were selected to specifically illustrate the phenomenon here, that a highly regarded engineering school might be discounted while an Ivy league school that normally isn't associated with Computer Science would be considered a positive indicator.<p>It's a little hard to argue with a recruiter, they've done far more placement than I have.  But I have worked (and done lots of interviews for) for a large silicon valley company, as well as for a few startups, and personally I think that a CS degree from UTex at Austin or UIUC would be very positively received.<p>Undergraduate curricula tends to be standardized, and nobody gets out of a top school without taking the tough courses.  But you can get wiggle through an MS.  But at the door... not so sure, the selection requirements (undergraduate GPA and GRE) at Berkeley were very high for any kind of admitted grad student.

Every significant target has been missed, every opportunity for increased use of fossil fuels has been taken, nuclear power is now practically-speaking off the table, and now that the Arctic ice cap is retreating, we're taking the opportunity to drill for more oil under it!<p>We have evolved under natural selection pressures to maximise our exploitation of the world around us - the winning apes were those that could make bigger & sharper tools, bigger fires, bigger farms. The idea that mankind has somehow veered away from the 'natural' path, that he is a 'disease' (the Matrix's Agent Smith), could not be further from the truth. <i>Every</i> organism competing in Earth's biosphere is trying to maximise their resource usage, maximise their mastery over the environment.<p>Our problem is that we have succeeded! We have grown to dominate the entire planet, and (Elon Musk notwithstanding) that's a hard limit. So we have what Iain Banks calls an 'outside context problem'. The strategies our genes have evolved over eons are now insufficient: there is no more competition between Man and anyone else. Even the competition of one human tribe against another is lessening, now that the big tribes have nuclear weapons.<p>Solving this problem will require post-Darwinian strategies. Getting to the point where that is a realistic prospect will be highly non-trivial.",1353421325

Paleo is one of the many philosophies I studied while I was developing my own eating behaviors, but there are plenty of foods I enjoy too much to fully stick to a plan that cuts happy things out of my life.<p>The problem this solves, in my mind, is less ""unhealthy food"" and more ""<i>tiny</i>, unhealthy food"", and that's interesting to me. Food that packs a lot of calories into a small space can be hugely detrimental to a good diet plan, because you don't realize how much you're eating. Embiggening the food to make you think you're eating larger quantities is a completely silly but still interesting idea.<p>Incidentally, anybody who finds this visualization cool and is also worrying about their own diet: you might find <i>Picture Perfect Weight Loss</i> worth a look. By comparing the calorie counts of similar foods, it does a great job highlighting which foods are shockingly worse for you than still-tasty, slightly-healthier counterparts.

Obviously when there is a world war, requirements go down dramatically to get things done, but when making purchase decisions in time of peace it seems that requirements are very high.  Items like devices/vehicles etc. get very expensive and complex.<p>[Added] Im talking from a US perspective, but it seems plausible that most developed country militaries spend on technology when in time of peace.",1353420378

4809006,comment,4808676,4808907,4,0,freehunter,,,"As an information security professional, I see two different issues at play here. First, they got access. They were granted access by the admin who did not lock down the server. I am not a lawyer, but I see the unauthenticated web server, no matter how much of a mistake, as being implicit permission to access the site. A house, by default, implies privacy. A web server is more of a business in this metaphor. If the door is open and the lights are on, it's implied you can come in and look around. Machines accessible over the web are by default open to everyone unless permission is revoked. The ""unauthorized access"" charge, in my opinion, should be struck down. When a site is made accessible from the unauthenticated Internet an admin implicitly granting you permission to visit the site.<p>The second issue at play is the fact that the guy apparently collected some email conversations to use as proof. Using my business metaphor, walking into a closed business that to a layman appears open is a simple mistake. Anyone could reasonably assume the business is open. However, collecting their merchandise even just to prove they forgot to lock up would still be stealing. In this situation, it's unauthorized copying. Most reasonable people would consider this to be unacceptable.<p>The second situation is muddied a bit further by my wording ""most"". Websites accessible when unauthenticated are able to be scraped easily. What if the Googlebot crawled the site and collected the information due to a poor robots.txt? What if you walked into the business and tried some free samples (unauthenticated websites are implicitly free samples)? Data privacy comes into play on this one though, and I would argue that any reasonable person would understand these as private communications. While they are accessible to view, any reasonable person would understand it is unethical to read them and unacceptable to copy them.<p>The fatal flaw of the defendant was copying the emails. Up to that point, he was completely within reasonable practice in my opinion. Here's a takeaway for any startups: security isn't a joke. It's a career ender, it's a business ender, and it could be a career ender for your customers who trusted you. You hire the best programmers, but budget a little aside for an external penetration test, and take the results seriously. Don't lose your company and your reputation because of a caffeine-fueled oversight.",1353420179

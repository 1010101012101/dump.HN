The beefier machines Microsoft pushed for Vista might negate the performance hit that older hardware might experience with the Elephant option. I&#x27;m sure others have more expertise (eg performance comparisons of old machines) in that area so I asked them.<p>Regarding your tangent, hardware encryption will almost always beat software encryption in same process node technology. The next best thing are processors highly-optimized for cryptography (eg GD&#x27;s AIM), vector processing with crypto-focused operators (SIMD/MIMD), or massively parallel processing with tiny cores (eg FPPA, GPU&#x27;s) using the right ciphers/cryptosystems. We saw less-mainstream work focusing on these three in late 90&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s because they would accelerate arbitrary crypto while making upgrades easy. Flexibility & cost-reduction trumped raw performance in many use-cases. Certain defense contractors still sell products like those with more R&D work ongoing. Also support my polymorphic cipher designs unlike hard blocks.",1433469369

9663426,comment,9661954,9663111,0,0,mikeash,,,"That&#x27;s not what that means. In the context of bytecode, a stack-based architecture is one where instructions directly manipulate stack entries. For example, the Java bytecode instruction iadd takes the top two entries from the stack, adds them together, and pushes the result onto the stack. This is in contrast to a register architecture, where you might have an instruction of the form `add x, y, z`, which takes the values in two registers, adds them, and stores the result in another register.<p>To say that Linux or C is stack-based is nonsensical, as it applies to an instruction set architecture.

Give me any CPG brand on the supermarket shelf right now and I can show you the supply chain and equipment needed to manufacture and deliver it.<p>Everything new gets commoditized eventually, especially considering it&#x27;s all made in China anyways, and trickles through the global markets at various pacing.<p>That varying speed is the only competitive advantage one has. Your only job is to stay ahead of the game then when the game is boring sell that information to others to replicate. AKA franchising.<p>Then you keep spinning and spinning until 30 years later you can stand to wait around while others jump into a new market, burn out, and just take whatever you want out of that situation to come up with a new product and utilize your large economies of scale to immediately sell it in your extended network of retail stores that&#x27;s making more per square foot than Tiffany&#x27;s.<p>But do agree with the second part.

Cell sizing is, typically, in commercial hives, dictated by the foundation sheets of wax put into frames, and sized ever so slightly larger than what&#x27;s found in wild or feral hives, on the principle that you get more honey from bees that are slightly larger.  I would note that we&#x27;re talking a few millimetres difference here.<p>On the other hand, massive reductions to the volumes of wild colonies suggest natural - what the bees would make themselves - sized cells aren&#x27;t a simple answer to this pest.<p>I&#x27;m in Australia, and hope to catch a few swarms this year - in this part of the world the first swarms are consistently seen in the first two weeks of September.

If you live in Pakistan, where suicide bombings happen all the time, I can understand being scared of terrorism. But in the US? Come on.<p>You know what I&#x27;m scared of? I have to drive two hours four days a week. I am much, much more likely to die in my car. Hell, I was more likely to die in my car <i>while I was in the military</i>. Most people know someone who either got injured or died in a car crash. It happens all the time. How many people know someone who died in a terrorist attack?<p>But we&#x27;re surrendering our freedom for the latter, which is a ridiculous phantom bogeyman, while we vigorously defend our right to die on the roadways.",1433466188

We haven&#x27;t found any that have stuck.<p>This has the potential (haven&#x27;t used it much yet) to enable us to quickly sketch UX concepts at early stages collaboratively, which is huge.<p>We don&#x27;t do real mockups that are persistent and used as a base for development anyway—it goes straight from paper sketches to HTML prototype. So this fills a real hole, just rough enough to work together on, just high fidelity enough to make sense to others.<p>Side note, &quot;mockup&quot; is such an ambiguous and relatively irrelevant term for whatever happens at this stage. A mockup here is just whatever you need to visually communicate the UI. The simpler and more malleable the better. If everyone understands the concept and how it translates to a UI in your application framework, then the process was successful.",1433466059

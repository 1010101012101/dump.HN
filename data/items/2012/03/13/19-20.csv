Nobel prizes were awarded to a trio of economists in 2001 for developing this idea of adverse selection in the 1970s. But his use of the concept may at least partly resolve the puzzle of why those with pre-existing conditions cant get insurance.<p>Another quote: This individual mandate is a natural fix to the problem of adverse selection in health insurance: It keeps the lowest-cost participants from opting out, and as a result the market doesnt unravel.",1331668038

We keep costs up by making laws that prevent employees from knowing how much their prepaid health plan costs.  Just in case people might want to react to the high costs by not purchasing a plan, in the near future everyone in the U.S. will be required by law to purchase a prepaid health plan.",1331665361

From my cursory reading, the contribution is to identify what kind of information asymmetry is involved in healthcare, namely that it's more about the cost of treatment than about the probability of illness.<p>I know that health insurance is often used to teach asymmetric information models, but it wasn't always obvious that it's a good example. Someone selling a used car might know a lot more about the car's hidden costs than anyone else, but does the typical buyer of health insurance really know more about his or her probability of illness than a sophisticated insurer with good doctors and actuaries and a lot of data?<p>This led some economists to argue that the problem in health insurance markets is not asymmetric information, but rather too much informationthe insurer already knows you will be a bad risk. This research makes it clear that there really is asymmetric information and spells out what it is.",1331665350

3699825,comment,3697341,3699778,1,0,rdl,,,"I agree most education should be free -- just not that 4-year residential institutions (particularly mediocre ones) should be subsidized.  The purpose of partial payment by the user for a service like community college is to discourage waste; something on the order of $100-200 per class would be adequate for that.  It would be payment by the student, not by his family.<p>The community college model is that you can work while attending.  I don't think it is unreasonable to expect someone to do so -- working full time while attending a 4 year university is probably not viable (I tried doing it, and ultimately dropped out), but I think the Internet should allow an expansion of the role of online courses and community college, both highly compatible with work-study.<p>I would go so far as to eliminate non-merit scholarships and financial aid (subsidized loans, etc.) for 4 year institutions (except for things like the GI Bill which are a form of compensation).  They should not be the mainstream form of education.<p>This only works if we can remove ""must have 4 year degree, we don't really care from where or in what"" as a job qualification for most jobs.  I'd like there to be qualification tests for jobs, vs. checking a box for a degree.  In this case, only circa 1900 level of 4 year college attendance would happen, and the vast majority (95%+) would have high school for general education and some specialized training beyond that for employment.",1331665214

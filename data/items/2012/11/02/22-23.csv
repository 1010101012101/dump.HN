Just because someone lives there doesn't automatically make them a part of the culture or 'detached and not personal', so I don't understand why you're generalizing here.<p>I've lived in the Bay area most of my life. I grew up in Silicon Valley and I'm living in SF now. Frankly, I've never seen this startup culture everyone talks about because I've chosen not to be a part of it. I've never been to a launch party, never been to a tech meetup, never been to a hackathon or these hackerspaces. Sure, I agree with you that the startup space is filled with douches and that's why I don't hang around those people. But that's a <i>fraction</i> of all the people living in Silicon Valley.<p>Have you even been to Silicon Valley before? Or even the Bay area in general? It's a huge place with lots of people. Your assumption is like me saying ""Dallas can suck it because I don't like cowboys."" It's a terrible argument.<p>In the future, please don't submit content to your own blog with link bait titles, thanks.",1351897137

Your argument is similar to how my parents argue about texting - you just don't get it, and because of a cultural mismatch, you probably never will. But as an entrepreneur, you need to be able to notice when you don't understand something, and you need to be above disregarding trends because you don't understand them - you should be trying to understand rather than just giving up and saying ""this is stupid"".<p>Separately, there are several reasons why people read tons of news articles they don't really care about.

He was talking about interrupt based programming specifically, and also addressed the common practice of some hardware to have asynchronous IO. You would start an IO operation, and go on and do other things, come back later and see the values there.<p>So these two things are not alike. They both cause confusion about what the program is doing, but they are not ""like"" each other.<p>To be a better programmer, it is good to read Dijkstra.

They are likely to get more bug reports than they can deal with. Every software project gets more bug reports than they can deal with. I have never found a software project in which there weren't people who were unhappy with how quickly they fix or respond to bugs. Could they hire someone to sort through their bug tracker, or hook it up to an analysis engine to look for potential duplicates? Maybe. But that would be a lot of time and money spent, for not much gain.<p>I don't see Chrome as being much worse than any other random project you can name; and in fact, their automated testing is good enough that I am comfortable running their Dev Channel browser as my primary browser, and have run into very few problems doing so. Once or twice it broke for a few days in ways that I never tracked down to report, but was fixed within a week; and there have been a couple of bugs that I have reported that have also been fixed within a week or two.

It can be as general as ""I'm looking for an experienced entrepreneur"" or it can be as specific as ""I'm looking for someone who knows how to setup a cap table"". Next step - Ask your contacts to make an email introduction for you. Now here's the key. Have humility. Your response to the introduction should be sincere and appreciative. Assuming you're looking for financing advice, you might try something like this:<p>""Hi <Name> - It's very nice to (virtually) meet you. As <your contact's name> mentioned, I just started my own company, and I'm looking for some mentorship/guidance on financing my venture. I understand that you have some deep experience in Venture Capital.<p>My question is... would you be willing to meet with me for coffee to give me your perspective on financing entrepreneurship, where angel comes in, where VC comes in, and perhaps how we should lay the foundation for VC in the future? Please let me know! I'd really appreciate it.""<p>Make sure you're thoughtful about the request. I wouldn't just say ""I'm looking for your help to get funded."" Ask about their perspective, and definitely make sure you ask for a face-to-face meeting, though you might have to settle for over the phone.

I did not get to like Emacs back then.<p>In fact I've gone years and years and years actually never fully liking emacs, beyond it being simpler to use than vim (which I still consider insane) while readily available on most shells. It was a safe haven, although a unpleasant one.<p>Recently though, I've dabbled in clojure. Eclipse is really not good for clojure development. Especially not so for learning how things works under the hood. So emacs is seemingly the lingo-franco in clojure circles, and I was forced to return to my old Java-related enemy. Or at least so I thought.<p>Out of the box, almost nothing is optimal for clojure development. So you have to add packages (emacs supports packages? nice!), you may have to tweak init.el to do so (emacs is configurable and programmable through its own lisp-dialect? nice!), oh and you may want to add some repos and map package-install over this collection of useful pacakages (no way!).<p>Once you're there and getting productive, you might encounter things you don't like. Google it and find ready-made lisp-code to import into your init.el, and your problem is solved.<p>I guess that's not really directly related to this article, but before heading to HN now, I had the realization that emacs, despite it being the horrible tool which Java made me hate, is actually pretty awesome.<p>You need the right perspective to fully appreciate something. This is crucial and something Java taught me this, although in the wrong way. And just as I realize this, then I see an article about Java and perspective.<p>I like cute litle coincidences like that :)",1351894544

If your message is mostly text, many people won't bother loading images and the ""open rate"" you're seeing reported is going to be a dramatic undercount.

4734977,comment,4730673,4732355,7,0,nacker,,,"If you want cynical gender realpolitik you must visit Heartiste, the enemy of pretty lies, who has a superb post today:<p><pre><code>    In simple terms, we proposed that in sex, women are the suppliers and men constitute the demand (Baumeister and Vohs 2004). Hence the anti-democratic, seemingly paradoxical sex ratio findings that Regnerus describes. When women are in the minority, the sexual marketplace conforms to their preferences: committed relationships, widespread virginity, faithful partners, and early marriage. For example, American colleges in the 1950s conformed to that pattern. In our analysis, women benefit in such circumstances because the demand for their sexuality exceeds the supply. In contrast, when women are the majority, such as on todays campuses as well as in some ethnic minority communities, things shift toward what men prefer: Plenty of sex without commitment, delayed marriage, extradyadic copulations, and the like. [ed: yep, life has been good for those of us who know the score.] [...]\n\n    Sexual marketplaces take the shape they do because nature has biologically built a disadvantage into men: a huge desire for sex that makes men dependent on women. Mens greater desire puts them at a disadvantage, just as when two parties are negotiating a possible sale or deal, the one who is more eager to make the deal is in a weaker position than the one who is willing to walk away without the deal. [ed: this is why practiced male aloofness is attractive to women -- it signals that the man is holding a stronger market position, and that his goods are therefore valuable.] Women certainly desire sex too  but as long as most women desire it less than most men, women have a collective advantage, and social roles and interactions will follow scripts that give women greater power than men (Baumeister et al. 2001). [ed: culture emerges from sexually differentiated genetic roots.] We have even concluded that the cultural suppression of female sexuality throughout much of history and across many different cultures has largely had its roots in the quest for marketplace advantage (see Baumeister and Twenge 2002). Women have often sustained their advantage over men by putting pressure on each other to restrict the supply of sex available to men. As with any monopoly or cartel, restricting the supply leads to a higher price. [...]\n\n    Recent work has found that across a large sample of countries today, the economic and political liberation of women is positively correlated with greater availability of sex (Baumeister and Mendoza 2011). Thus, mens access to sex has turned out to be maximized not by keeping women in an economically disadvantaged and dependent condition, but instead by letting them have abundant access and opportunity. [ed: was the sexual and feminist revolution fomented by undersexed beta males? a case can be made.] In an important sense, the sexual revolution of the 1970s was itself a market correction. Once women had been granted wide opportunities for education and wealth, they no longer had to hold sex hostage (Baumeister and Twenge 2002). [ed: that is, they no longer had to suffer the indignity of beta provider courtship. now that they had the resources, it was open season on alpha male cock hopping. the sexual revolution appears to have backfired on beta males expecting a bigger slice of the snatch pie.]\n\n    What does all this mean for men? The social trends suggest the continuing influence of a stable fact, namely the strong desire of young men for sexual activity. As the environment has shifted, men have simply adjusted their behavior to find the best means to achieve this same goal. Back in 1960, it was difficult to get sex without getting married or at least engaged, and so men married early. To be sure, this required more than being willing to bend the knee, declare love, and offer a ring. To qualify as marriage material, a man had to have a job or at least a strong prospect of one (such as based on an imminent college degree). The mans overarching goal of getting sex thus motivated him to become a respectable stakeholder contributing to society.\n\n    The fact that men became useful members of society as a result of their efforts to obtain sex is not trivial, and it may contain important clues as to the basic relationship between men and culture (see Baumeister 2010). Although this may be considered an unflattering characterization, and it cannot at present be considered a proven fact, we have found no evidence to contradict the basic general principle that men will do whatever is required in order to obtain sex, and perhaps not a great deal more. [ed: that last clause is critical. men will always take the path of least resistance to sex. it is up to women to make that path more difficult if they want to extract more concessions from men.] (One of us characterized this in a previous work as, If women would stop sleeping with jerks, men would stop being jerks.) If in order to obtain sex men must become pillars of the community, or lie, or amass riches by fair means or foul, or be romantic or funny, then many men will do precisely that. This puts the current sexual free-for-all on todays college campuses in a somewhat less appealing light than it may at first seem. [ed: what's interesting and unspoken here is that the sexual free-for-all is chugging along nicely well beyond and outside of the college years, with the difference being that, in their 20s and 30s, a select number of fewer men (let's call them... alpha males) are enjoying the ample premarital rewards of sexually available women.] Giving young men easy access to abundant sexual satisfaction deprives society of one of its ways to motivate them to contribute valuable achievements to the culture. [ed: damn, i'm torn. do i want a thriving society or easier access to sex? yeeeeah... i'll take the latter and leave the self-sacrifice required of the former for the anti-poolside chumps.]\n\n    The changes in gender politics since 1960 can be seen as involving a giant trade, in which both genders yielded something of lesser importance to them in order to get something they wanted more (Baumeister and Vohs 2004). As Regnerus states, partly based on our own extensive survey of research findings, men want sex, indeed more than women want it (Baumeister et al. 2001). Women, meanwhile, want not only marriage but also access to careers and preferential treatment in the workplace. [ed: women are the reproductively more valuable sex, and so it makes sense that evolution would have ""gifted"" women with an oversized entitlement complex and the inability to engage in self-criticism.]\n\n    The giant trade thus essentially involved men giving women not only easy access but even preferential treatment in the huge institutions that make up society, which men created. [ed: but the grand bargain did not work out as intended for the masses of beta males who acquiesced to the new girl order. while alpha males certainly saw more action from ""liberated"" women, the average joe did not. instead, all the average joe got in return for sacrificing his workplace status in hopes of easier sex was... a heaping helping of humiliation and wage stagnation and anti-joe animus, which continues at an accelerated pace to this day. this is a critical distinction i would like to see Baumeister address.] Today most schools, universities, corporations, scientific organizations, governments, and many other institutions have explicit policies to protect and promote women. It is standard practice to hire or promote a woman ahead of an equally qualified man. Most large organizations have policies and watchdogs that safeguard womens interests and ensure that women gain preferential treatment over men. Parallel policies or structures to protect mens interests are largely nonexistent and in many cases are explicitly prohibited. Legal scholars, for example, point out that any major new law is carefully scrutinized by feminist legal scholars who quickly criticize any aspect that could be problematic or disadvantageous to women, and so all new laws are women-friendly. Nobody looks out for men, and so the structural changes favoring women and disadvantaging men have accelerated (Baumeister and Vohs 2004).

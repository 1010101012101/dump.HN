I do think there's a potential that those investors could file claims against Facebook and Ivan if he does end up working on Facebook's payment system.<p>Again, I'm not pointing out anything against Ivan but I do want to know as entrepreneurs, if we do get into such a situation, what sort of risks/factors could arise from this?",1250967449

The replacement value of a start-up amounts to a hiring bonus for its developers. This is likely true even with substantial user traction.<p>We saw much the same thing in the implied valuation of iLike - after liquidation preference, developers basically get a hiring bonus, if they stick around. And iLike had 10 million monthly users on Facebook.<p>So unless a start-up has a plausible path to independent profitability, it is going to be subject to the brutal laws of a buyer's market.

We'll definitely incorporate them (I'm the programmer).<p>The basics:<p>1) An account includes 5 free books (it should say ""you have 5 book credits"" on the left navigation) and unlimited students.<p>2) All accounts have at least ONE student. If you are a parent with 3 children, or a teacher with 30 you'll want to sort your books (and their customizations) by ""student"".<p>3) All books are complete with text and pictures.<p>4) Books are purchased in blocks (""credits""), i.e., if you purchase 10 books you'll have 10 book credits. It's THEN that you can click the dollar sign and ""acquire"" the book.<p>5) Books can be customized after they are ""acquired"".<p>6) Stock and custom books can be downloaded (in PDF) after they are ""acquired"" (the icons are terrible right now, sorry!).<p>7) ALL books are customizable. There are ""suggested customizations"" as part of the reading program, but you can customize <i>everything</i> (which could result in an entirely different book) if you so desired. You can customize a book only ONCE.<p>We will work on making this more clear...",1250964223

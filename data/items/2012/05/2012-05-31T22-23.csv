Retaining 10-20% free space is generally encouraged.<p>If you do elect to do the ""copy out, wipe, copy in"" method, you can do this, in general, while not completely losing the use of your system.  There are some tricks (union mounts, remounting filesystems) which will allow you to flip between filesystems, in most cases.  Specifics will depend on your partitioning scheme, use case, and the filesystems under consideration (usually you'd be dealing with user files under /home, spool or variable files under /var, source trees, etc.).<p>As the article states, Linux systems generally experience very minimal fragmentation, and dynamically resolve the issue for you, unlike Windows.  You can typically run a Linux system for years, given a 10-20% disk reserve, without running into appreciable fragmentation issues.  The gains from <i>any</i> sort of manual defragmentation would be minimal compared to the cost of performing the task.",1338505132

This became pretty obvious during the Microsoft Anti-trust trial as technical witnesses struggled to explain the ramifications of what 'bundling' did. And the problem extends throughout the system since these things get appealed etc.<p>So 15 years later, we start getting Federal judges who know a bit about computers (and Alsup knows more than many) and that leads to rulings that are a lot more reasonable.<p>Part of the 'pain' we feel is that the world change rate is faster than the institution adaption rate, however institutions that are designed to adapt do, and we are starting to see the benefit of that. In another 15 years these judges from today will be filling appellate and circuit court seats, even supreme court seats. And then it will be very difficult indeed to claim that using a laser pointer to amuse a cat is novel or patentable.",1338504917

4050855,comment,4050247,4050247,14,0,jaysonelliot,,,"I have no trouble with the concept of spec work as a way of judging ability, but I do have a problem with it being approached the wrong way.<p>I recently applied to join a YC-funded startup as their UX designer. We had a lot of discussion back and forth, and went through several (very fun) interviews. Then, after we'd all met and gotten along very well, and they liked my background, they asked for a spec design.<p>The spec was both the UX and design for an upcoming feature on the site. I asked as many questions as I could, although being an interview process rather than a client, I found that I wasn't able to have the kind of back and forth, collaborative discussions that I would normally. Presumably they wanted me to just show them my chops, and didn't want to invest the time in longer discussions, or felt a successful candidate wouldn't need that kind of involvement from them.<p>My first step was to provide a set of detailed user scenarios, laying out the rationale behind my approach, and showing how a typical user interaction would play out through a series of steps. I included some wireframes of the screens I felt would be needed for the scenario. The feedback they gave was positive, and I moved on to the design.<p>A couple days later, I delivered my design. I asked if I could present it to them, explain the reasons behind it, and get any feedback, maybe even make some edits if it wasn't where they wanted to go. Instead, they asked me to just email them the designs without any discussion. I sent them off, and waited.<p>Two or three days after that, I got an email saying simply that they had shown the designs to a creative director that was helping them out, and decided not to proceed with me. They cited as negatives several things about the UX that were clearly shown in the earlier deliverable, which surprised me, since I had kept them in the design based on the positive feedback I'd heard earlier. 
The startup didn't have any established look and feel or branding yet, and they told me to just do whatever I felt like doing. With nothing to go on, I had to take a shot in the dark. When the feedback came that it wasn't the kind of look they wanted, I felt frustrated because there was no opportunity to revise it to go in a direction they would like.
There was no opportunity to talk about the work, try to get on the same page, or see how I actually performed in a startup environment. It just felt like I'd been participating in a ""spray & pray"" design competition.<p>I'm not upset that I didn't get the job, although they were great guys. I don't think they owed me any ""do-overs"" or anything like that. What I did feel was that my time and effort was taken for granted, and having my work dismissed by someone I'd never met did feel disrespectful and a bit ill-advised.<p>When you're running a startup with limited resources and tight schedules, you have to be very careful about the hiring decisions you make. Asking someone to demonstrate their abilities and work style by doing some work is a great idea. If you are going to do that, though, you should put that person in a real work environment, not an unpaid design competition. Treat them like a freelancer, bring them on for a test, and give them a task. Pay them something out of respect for their time. It doesn't have to be a corporate market rate, but it should be enough to show that you're serious. Work just like you would with any team member, even though it's a quick task. Large agencies do it all the time by bringing in freelancers and hiring the ones that do the best job. It's a test drive.<p>If you approach hiring this way as a startup, you'll have the best opportunity to see who will actually make great employees, and you'll get a great reputation to boot.",1338504739

In there you'll see a property called ""Reserved Block Count"". That is space reserved for kernel use to avoid fragmentation, continue logging, and for any other tasks the kernel/root user may need to do on a full filesystem. Users cannot write to this and your disk utilities will report your disk being full even if this reserved space is still available.<p>I believe it is typically 5% of the partition size. If your partition is hundreds of gigabytes then the reserved portion may be tens of gigabytes (multiply the reserved blocks by the block size to get total byte size).<p>You can change the percentage of this portion with the tune2fs -m flag. I have filled up a 500 GB backup drive with 0% reserved blocks (%5 reserved would have meant that 25GB was unusable) with no issues.

Note however that even the most individualistic person still accepts the vast majority of the cultural assumptions with which they are brought up. Too much crititcal thought would interfere with the transmission of culture and without culture (i.e. those things which we've learned without having to figure out for ourselves) humans are a fairly weak animal.<p>> Although I'm not a follower of Thoreau, I think he made a fair argument that it is not at all unhealthy to live outside of society.<p>Yet Thoreau still had social contact.

4050732,comment,4049764,4049764,4,0,teyc,,,"Windows 8 is an interesting release from a historical standpoint. Microsoft has been a long proponent of preserving APIs. Just as Windows95 supported DOS, and WinNT supported Win32 APIs. Windows 8 is a totally different beast. It's a new API, not even .NET, that's built on an existing OS. As such, it is more like Android, which is a mobile phone API built on top of Linux.<p>In many ways, programmers are discouraged from interacting with existing operating system services. One can't even access database drivers when writing WinRT programs. Everything is managed via web services.<p>So MS is not in a position of strength:<p>1. It is not a backwards compatible release (by necessity, due to battery life requirements)<p>2. It will have to create a market - i.e. ecosystem of developers and consumers<p>3. It has lackluster record - Windows Phone has little market share, despite being a solid OS<p>4. It has burned a lot of bridges and karma by abandoning their ethos of supporting old APIs. e.g. Silverlight, Windows Phone 7.5<p>This means that developers who take a risk with Windows 8 will find that if it tanks, they do not expect the APIs to be maintained in the future. Despite MS baking these WinRT APIs into Windows 8, they represent such a departure from desktop models that you couldn't bring those investments back to the desktop without significant work.<p>Meanwhile, the iPads are making deep inroads into enterprises and schools. Even if aficionados BYOD use Windows 8, MS will have to play underdogs from now on.<p>The only problem is - MS no longer know how to act like one.<p>My prediction? Lackluster adoption, massive layoffs just like HP in the next 20 months.",1338503132

More of a hurdle, and perhaps not one that everyone would have; the nature of dreams is very individualized and varies so much with so many things.  Mine are usually very visual, but if I'm doing a lot of programing for a few days, they become abstract and syntactic in ways I find it hard to recall clearly.  Maybe I've trained my dream-recall to overuse spatial aspects as a crutch.<p>And I would think short and mid-term time contiguity amenable to training (one can certainly learn to spot the skips more readily).  And the more common, persistent dream-stabilizing methods would be a good place to start (I find having one dream-hand constantly scratching at its palm, or the palm of the other dream-hand to be a pretty good, persistent I'm-in-a-dream-reminder/stabilizer).  Apply one to stabilize the dream, and then keep doing it even with the dream largely stable while thinking through the problem.  I didn't try that (when I noticed the time skipping, I started trying to figure out how to use them, like control the skipped interval, rather than reduce their frequency).<p>My worry is that ""filling in what you attend to"" is a pretty general thing/feature/mechanism across all the senses I've tested in dreams.  Along with ""one's expectations"", it is near to the foundations of what I think dreams are made of (speaking internally that is; speaking externally, they are made of brain region activations and neuron spikes and such).  So there may be a limit to how much one can reduce/corral it on each sense modality.  Well exercised short-term memory will probably help with that on the memory channel, since it does on the visual/spatial one... like with objects persisting when you turn your back to them and then look again.  But then the capacity limit to working memory comes into play.<p>And there seems to be only so much I can split my in-dream attention between maintaining awareness that I'm in a dream (so as to keep it stable) and giving room in my working memory for new dream developments/updates to take place.  Which is somewhat weird, because if I just look out on a dream vista (or just some wood grain), the landscape can be amazingly complex and rich with shape and color.  But the more or longer I control my attention and hold fixed the way the dreamworld is allowed to update (no random stuff insertions or location shifts), the less those richly productive, autonomous visual updates seem to even try.  The dream gets duller, and the fewer things around the more unstable it gets.  I seem to have to allow the dream production mechanisms some free reign of randomness to maintain the sensation-expectation feedback loop going with content.<p>But maybe all of this is a product of my outlook.  I look for the limits of dreams like the rendering limits of a game-engine.  So maybe my dreamworlds oblige me and provide all manner of limits built around the kinds of limits I expect our wet-ware simulated worlds to have.  If so, sorry to have infected your dream-thinking with these things.<p>And heck, just thinking for a bit in a dream about the rough shape, the requirements a solution must have so as to setup some very strong expectations, and then skipping forward in time a bit (or expecting to find the solution in a drawer and opening the drawer) and looking over your subconscious' creative ""fill it in as I look"" solution could very well be a good tool for seeing possibilities you wouldn't arrive at through more straight-forward thinking.",1338502869

Your research in academia is paid for by customers of the institution, both former and present, and possibly governments (who are also interested in the product of the research). Your shortsighted world view is tragically common in those who favor academia, and without paying customers driving research into new areas, your precious academia wouldn't exist and you'd do well to understand that. Money is everything.<p>What the hell do you think the point of academia is? All throughout history, the sciences are almost always advanced due to a pressing need or mistake from practical execution.<p>> cs is what matters.<p>Execution is the only thing in the world that matters. You are basically admitting that you're the idea guy, searching for a ""technical co-founder"".<p>Had Mark Zuckerberg spent a lot of time worried about the runtime efficiency of parts of his code or whether there was a more efficient algorithm for sorting friends, Facebook would be nothing today. He executed and didn't give a shit, because he wasn't exercising computer science, he was exercising building a product.<p>Surely people went back and made things more efficient as Facebook scaled, but I've been at a rapidly-growing startup a while, and I haven't made my product more efficient through many computer science advances. Most have been using better software, better network topology, better configuration, less dumb code, and so on.<p>Your attitude completely misses what the article is explaining, and, frankly, your ad hominem on the guy talking about Agile is completely out of place when practically your entire LinkedIn profile is buzzwords, just your field instead of his.<p>(Aside: I love that HN makes it really easy to build a list of no-hires, fairly easily, just by observing how people think and communicate.)",1338502371

    design of methods in an API was a creative endeavor. Of 
    course, that is true. Inventing a new method to deliver a
    new output can be creative, even inventive, including the
    choices of inputs needed and outputs returned. The same is
    true for classes. But such inventions  at the concept and
    functionality level  are protectable only under the 
    Patent Act.

    ...

    That a system or method of operation has thousands of 
    commands arranged in a creative taxonomy does not change 
    its character as a method of operation. Yes, it is 
    creative. Yes, it is original. Yes, it resembles a 
    taxonomy. But it is nevertheless a command structure, a 
    system or method of operation  a long hierarchy of over 
    six thousand commands to carry out pre-assigned functions. 
    For that reason, it cannot receive copyright protection  
    patent protection perhaps  but not copyright protection.

This allowed trade to flourish and civilizations to prosper in this part. The fertile crescent was the hub of all this, you can trace the origin of European civilization to this point. You could simplify it and say that it went like this: Egypt, Greece, Rome and Europe. Meanwhile, there was a huge dessert isolating Sub-Saharan Africa. You have to keep in mind though that Timbuktu for example didn't spring out of nothing but thanks to Muslims from the North.<p>Other places were able to get their own civilization thanks to one reason or the other, e.g. Eastern China.<p>All that has to do with achievements of different societies. Now at the individual level, how do we know whether groups with Caucasian genes would have been able to develop a civilization if they had lived in a place with the same geography and conditions as Sub-Saharan Africans? We can't know.<p>What we know though is that the conditions are there now for individuals with predominantly Sub-Saharan ancestry to show what they are capable of.

There has been one study I know of that showed a very strong correlation between tight, non-inflationary monetary policy and GDP growth over 200 years of American history.

I have forgotten much of what my first year philosophy professor said, but one thing that has always stuck with me was his opinion that If we didnt have philosophers, wed still be burning witches.<p>That philosophy is useless because it in not practical is the same sort of thinking as expressed by reluctant students taking algebra and pre-calculus: <i>Why do we need to know this stuff? Its not like I will use it in everyday life.</i> True, for the most part, many things you learn in a math course you will not need to live your everyday life. However, learning these things teaches you how to think, how to reason, and that answers can be derived by methodically applying known principles to discover the unknown. Athletes perform many exercises in the gym using motions and machines they will never encounter in their respective sport, but the point is of course these exercises help to make the body stronger and build endurance.  The same principle applies to philosophy.<p>To me, the spirit of philosophy is asking why when everyone just accepts, much like the student in this anecdote:<p>One day when I was a junior medical student, a very important Boston surgeon visited the school and delivered a great treatise on a large number of patients who had undergone successful operations for vascular reconstruction. At the end of the lecture, a young student at the back of the room timidly asked, Do you have any controls? Well, the great surgeon drew himself up to his full height, hit the desk, and said, Do you mean did I not operate on half of the patients? The hall grew very quiet then. The voice at the back of the room very hesitantly replied, Yes, thats what I had in mind. Then the visitors fist really came down as he thundered, Of course not. That would have doomed half of them to their death. God, it was quiet then, and one could scarcely hear the small voice ask, Which half? -Dr. E. E. Peacock, Jr",1311520529

But, at the same time, before actually starting the research that gets them their PhDs, gradute students spend time in advanced courses and later on read lots of research papers and additional textbooks. This is an invaluable process of unsupervised learning (hence the first paragraph), and I think that getting a PhD also gives you the abilities and experience to autonomously go from zero knowledge in an area to contributing new knowledge by reading. Of course, studying at a university saves you a lot of time, because somebody else--the professor--who is already very knowledgeable in the target area has already broken down his knowledge in edible--and ideally pedagogically-sound--pieces ready to be sucked up. But if time is not of the essence, and since you are already a driven and focused person, you should be able to do it by yourself.<p>So this was (quite unexpectedly) rather long, a more detailed discussion and probably a very good book to read for anybody can be found in: Mortimer Jerome Adler's wonderful ""How to read a book"". A brief summary for tl;dr reasons: I love and totally support your reading advice, but since the PhD experience enables you to work your way through literature in unknown territory, it might very well be worth the effort.",1311519911

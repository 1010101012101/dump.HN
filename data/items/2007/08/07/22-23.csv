The rest can be duplicated overseas and I think powerful international brands will emerge eventually, unless we're already past the age of brands.<p>I think the peak of US civilization was the first bubble era. After that, George W Bush and his horrendous economic and imperialist policies combined with the <i>worst Congress ever</i>  have further hastened the decline of America.<p>Our currency is worth half as much as it was in 1999! It's hard to notice for the rich, but for young people without money, life is getting harder. If you don't have an engineering degree or a CS degree+portfolio, there aren't any jobs without graduate education in something relevant. And good luck paying for graduate school when your net worth is already -$100,000.<p>Inflation is creeping up but it's hard to tell because the government doesn't publish M3 numbers anymore. I just don't see anything that can reverse this trend and I'd like to get out while I can. If I don't make a good amount of money soon, I'm afraid of being trapped in America instead of being able to move overseas and cheaply rebuy America later.",1186527261

40277,comment,40208,40271,0,0,tuukkah,,,"Now that I think of it, perhaps the USD going down means the US markets lose their importance, also in the eyes of the US companies. Their problem would be, when you're based in the US, it might be difficult to understand international markets. At least I've yet to see an ATM where you can deposit money ;-)\n",1186526778

WSJ will go free (mark my words) and will take a away a ton of NYT's traffic. NYT is fortifying its traffic and is trying to boost it before Murdoch makes a direct assault.",1186526470

40272,comment,40097,40097,0,0,dood,,,"A good question to pose would be: assuming a significant economic downturn is likely, how would this affect typical 'web 2.0' businesses?<p>The answer may well be 'badly'. A great deal of these sites presume a healthy, wealthy economy: they hope to generate income from ads, or subscriptions, or hope for investment and/or buyout. All of these routes will be significantly impacted by a liquidity crunch.<p>Many sites with small margins, or hoping for investment, or looking for a big sale, or counting on getting big fast may then have real problems.<p>I am not denying that there are many opportunities on the web, or saying that it is necessarily a bad time to be in the internet business. I am suggesting that anything less than a solid business may prove extremely vulnerable to a small-medium recession.",1186526359
40271,comment,40208,40262,0,0,rms,,,"All of your points are true and it's especially good to be USD based if you're debt financed. Most startups intended to grow rapidly are financed with equity though, not debt.<p>If you're outside of the USA, it's much easier to keep your money in a foreign currency. You just go to the ATM and deposit the money instead of having to go out of your way to maintain a portfolio hedged against the collapse of the USD.",1186526250
40270,comment,40222,40247,0,0,nickb,,,"We went with Python + Django. It was an excellent choice for us! We don't have any performance & scaling issues so far (and we have a pretty big site already) and programmer productivity has been nothing short of amazing.<p>In the end, pick whatever you feel more comfortable with and whatever the market you have company in supports. If it's easy to find RoR folks around where you live, use that... if it's easier to find Python people, maybe you should use Python instead. They're both excellent languages and a huge improvement over Java/C++/C#.",1186526228

40268,comment,40208,40208,0,0,nickb,,,"Easier time finding great talent is a big plus. Probably the biggest of all of the things mentioned here. Silicon Valley's full of great companies and you'll be competing with some heavy-weights to gain attention of great candidates. Also, you will most certainly ovepay. Canada does not have such a big problem with finding great talent.",1186526051

The time people spend working on their profile, building friends and relationships ... etc is probably worth much more to them than a $300 iPod.",1186525933
40266,comment,40222,40251,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""If you're working on a startup, do you really want to spend valuable time getting up to speed with a programming language that you don't know""<p>I did that.<p>It probably hurt the startup a bit - we'd be moving much faster if I didn't have to learn the technologies as I went along.  Thing is - the web technologies I really know well consist of PHP and JSF, and I know them well enough to know that I do <i>not</i> want to be programming in them if I can help it.<p>I figure that any startup will be taking up a good chunk of your time, and you might as well make it at least semi-enjoyable.  I'd much rather put in the up-front effort to learn Python and have a tool that can grow with me than curse PHP's naming conventions or lack thereof for the umpteenth time.",1186525570
40265,comment,40222,40222,0,0,rzwitserloot,,,"No question. PHP. However, this doesn't mean you should follow suit. In particular, PHP works best as a vanilla choice, something to get set up with quickly. The moment you start using e.g. Cake, the point of PHP is no longer and you should look elsewhere.<p>There's no useful answer in any case, just hints and use cases. It depends entirely on what you're building.<p>Heavy single-purpose web app like gmail? No question - GWT.<p>Light multi-purpose web app with lots of pages but where some ajax here and there wouldn't go amiss: rails looks good.<p>etcetera.\n",1186525548
40264,comment,40208,40208,0,0,alex_c,,,">I might not be seeing potential problems with Canada. If you understand things better, please leave a comment here.<p>Well, just my two cents as a Canadian citizen:<p>- the major cities have a fair share of high-tech companies and workforce.  Finding good talent is hard everywhere, but it should be easier in Canada than in SF - a lot of good people are probably dying of boredom at a financial institution or just finished university and are looking south for interesting jobs, rather than starting their own.<p>- cost of living is lower than in SF, but in the major cities it's not MUCH lower<p>- there is a start-up scene, you might just have to look a bit harder<p>- from what I'm told, investors are more cautious, money doesn't get thrown at you<p>- health care!<p>- you don't get to enjoy the perfect temperatures in the Bay Area<p>- all cities are different. Vancouver != Toronto != Montreal, just like San Francisco != Boston != New York.  Do your research.",1186525370

Or did you just want to  try something new/better supported?<p>I'm thinking of taking a look at django just because guido tells me to, but I don't see any strong reason to switch.",1186525213
40262,comment,40208,40250,0,0,tuukkah,,,"Even if you're located in the US, can't you keep any significant amounts of money in the currency of your choice though? For any debt it should be good if the currency loses value. And startup ownership is percentages of future value instead of some fixed nomination in a currency. <p>When the value of the US dollar keeps falling, it becomes more and more difficult for foreign companies to keep their prices low for the US customers.",1186525069

40260,comment,40194,40194,0,0,geebee,,,"This comment redefines terms to make a point.  Instead of doing ten times the work, a super hacker finds a way to shrink the amount of the work by 90%.  <p>It amounts to the same thing, but it's still a good perspective.  In this sense you could say that people don't actually get more done when they switch from Struts and Hibernate to Ruby on Rails - they just don't have as much to do.",1186524713
40259,comment,40222,40249,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Hard to tell what the finished product will have, because we're nowhere near done.  The site that's currently up at www.diffle.com is 707 lines of HTML, 733 CSS, 6283 Python (including all server administration tools), and 81 JavaScript.  (These figures include comments and tests, which are fairly extensive in the Python and basically omitted on the frontend.)  However, that's a very Web 1.0 site, with AJAX used in only a couple places where it really improves usability.<p>The 8 or so prototypes we've done for the more dynamic aspects total about 1000 lines of JavaScript and 3107 lines of ActionScript, but this is misleading.  Since they're prototypes, they often copy straight from each other and don't bother to factor out common functionality.<p>I'm expecting it'll be something like 60/40 front/back by the time we're done, with nearly all of the post-launch code going on the front.  But much of the JavaScript and ActionScript may be generated by Python scripts running on the backend.  Kinda hard to say what's front-end and what back-end then.",1186524566

7124074,comment,7114310,7123315,2,0,taspeotis,,,"Thanks for the extra testing.<p>My biggest problem with these benchmarks and your queries I cover in this [1] post.<p>If <i>databases.name</i> is unique then you&#x27;d have a unique index/constraint on it. Doing this in the environment I set up causes SQL Server to generate identical execution plans for all three queries.<p>If <i>databases.name</i> is not unique then your query&#x27;s <i>group by name</i> doesn&#x27;t make sense. I&#x27;ll just quote what I wrote verbatim:<p>> No online retailer is looking at their sales reports and thinking that <i>John Smith</i> is their best customer and <i>Amorette McFredson</i> is their worst.<p>> ... I don’t know whether the query that was chosen for optimization because it’s good for demonstrating the technique on PgSQL or because it represents a query that is actually in use. I don’t like <i>group by name</i> without knowing whether dashboard names are unique.<p>> With that said, if it’s not unique then the query is arguably “wrong” because it aggregates results for distinct dashboard names rather than distinct dashboards.<p>> Removing the unique index on dashboards.name does change the execution plan of the first query – it’s slightly worse than the other two (which remain identical). “Fixing” the first query to group by dashboards.id and dashboards.name causes the better plan to be generated again.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ta.speot.is/2014/01/25/use-subqueries-to-count-distinct-0x-faster/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ta.speot.is/2014/01/25/use-subqueries-to-count-distin...</a>",1390715850

7124066,comment,7122228,7122228,1,0,wikwocket,,,"This is a cool idea. If the creators are watching this channel, might I suggest a few ideas?<p>- Tweak the campaign page layout to more closely match Kickstarter et al. Big hero graphic/video, packages down the right, extensive sales pitch down the left. This layout is effective, flexible, and more importantly, the de facto standard for crowdfunding. You want people to immediately grok what the campaign is and how it works.<p>- Allow projects to have screenshots/mockups/videos/slideshow/etc. If you want campaigns to succeed, let people put some sexy graphics up there, maybe even the occasional high-production-value Kickstarer-esque video. Worth a thousand words, and all that.<p>- If you get critical mass, allow people to browse projects. This will allow potential clients to see all the campaigns out there, and may even build a community of backers. This is one of the real assets of Kickstarter - a community of early adopters, ready to spend cash for fun projects, frequently checking the &quot;popular projects&quot; page.",1390715737

I think there are times when this is a necessary discussion to have. I want to see more women get involved in programming, and I am happy to point out instances of men perpetuating a sexist culture.<p>With that said, I don&#x27;t see it here. I really don&#x27;t. And I understand the concept of lots of little things adding up over time, where one joke would not be offensive, but a constant barrage would be. I think of myself as someone who isn&#x27;t bothered at all by swearing, but I have a housemate who literally swears in every other sentence and it is the most grating thing to me. It&#x27;s not once instance, it&#x27;s the accumulation over time. But I don&#x27;t think this is similar.<p>&quot;Bro&quot; being offensive seems very highly specific to particular subcultures that I guess I&#x27;m not a part of. I guess there are people for whom that word has some highly negative connotation, maybe the people who are called &quot;bros&quot; derogatorily, but I don&#x27;t understand why this pun is offensive to women. Gender isn&#x27;t some super shameful characteristic that I flinch at any reminder of its existence. If I used this tool, I guarantee you that I would not be subtlely reminded that I am an &quot;other&quot;, that I am not a &quot;bro&quot;; I use git all day every day and I honestly forget that it has any other meaning.<p>I hate to say this, because women feeling excluded from tech is a big, real problem, but this conversation trivializes it. People who need to hear that this is a problem are going to see this discussion and think that women are being ridiculous. Women are not underrepresented in tech because of <i>this</i>.

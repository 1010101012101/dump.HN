Its not his intelligence that bothers me, but the fact that he&#x27;s a veritable walking scientific encyclopedia. Secondly, by adding rationality to Harry, the author also seems to have added a healthy dose of irrational fears.

8055984,comment,8055868,8055868,27,0,greenyoda,,,"One of Ousterhout&#x27;s examples of this principle is something that comes up frequently on HN:<p><i>&quot;Before I came back to academia a couple of years ago I was out doing startups.  What I noticed is that when people hire they are almost always hire based on experience.  They&#x27;re looking for somebody&#x27;s resume trying to find the person who has already done the job they want them to do three times over.  That&#x27;s basically hiring based on Y-intercept.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very good way to hire.  The people who are doing the same thing over and over again often get burnt out and typically the reason they&#x27;re doing the same thing over and over again is they&#x27;ve maxed out.  They can&#x27;t do anything more than that.  And, in fact, typically what happens when you level off is you level off slightly above your level of competence.  So in fact you&#x27;re not actually doing the current job all that well.<p>So what I would always hire on is based on aptitude, not on experience.  You know, is this person ready to do the job?  They may never have done it before and have no experience in this area, but are they a smart person who can figure things out?  Are they a quick learner?  And I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s a much better way to get really effective people.&quot;</i>",1405723618

8055967,comment,8050065,8052385,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"There are different types of interferometry and different &quot;waves&quot; of interferometry development.<p>The first wave started around the mid 19th century and saw the advent of lots of new instrumentation that revolutionized science. Speed of light measurements. The Michelson-Morley interferometry test which laid the foundation for Relativity. Later FT-IR instrumentation. Fabry-Perot imaging. Etc.<p>The second(?) wave happened in the late 20th/early 21st century and surrounded visible light imaging, synthetic aperture interferometric telescope systems. Most major large telescope installations built since the 1990s have incorporated interferometric plans into them. The Keck 1 & 2 telescopes, for example, and the Very Large Telescope array. Both were built with the idea that interferometry systems would enable observations with &quot;virtual&quot; telescopes having diameters on the order of 100m. However, that hasn&#x27;t worked out to be nearly as useful nor as practical as was imagined. The Keck Interferometer has been mothballed due to lack of interest/funding and the VLTI has been rarely used and has struggled to remain relevant. In fact, it&#x27;s been found that large telescopes aren&#x27;t particularly advantageous for interferometric unit telescopes.<p>Add to that the saga of space based interferometeric observatories, which have so far come to naught. There was the long-planned, long-revised space interferometry mission which was finally cancelled some years back. Then there were several varieties of telescopic interferometer arrays or formation flying fleets tasked mostly with detecting and observing distant planets (such as NASA&#x27;s &quot;terrestrial planet finder&quot; concept and ESA&#x27;s &quot;Darwin&quot; concept along similar lines). The idea of those was to use interferometry to both create very high resolution imaging and also to deeply &quot;null&quot; the starlight of parent stars. Over the last decade or two the limitations and difficulties of interferometry have become more apparent and the competitive advantage of alternate methods (such as large ground based telescopes using ordinary coronographs coupled with adaptive optics and space-based telescopes using coronographs) has more or less erased the promised future of interferometric telescope arrays as a new major class of instrumentation that would open up huge new realms of observation.",1405723276

In my mind, trafficking is no different from slavery. It&#x27;s a vile thing. A sex worker, on the other hand, can choose to have a pimp -- but one is not required.<p>I have absolutely no problem with law enforcement cracking down on trafficking. Those people are not selling their services out of their own will. But trying to mandate morality by law makes my hair stand out.<p>I happen to believe that indiscriminately cracking down on all forms of prostitution is simply a waste of resources. The similarity between aggressive pro-lifers (who want to impose their own views on how women can use their bodies) and anti-prostitution zealots is not that big.

When you&#x27;ve spend the best part of a day carefully explaining how NOT (a OR b) is the same as (NOT a) AND (NOT b) to the &quot;programmer&quot; at the next desk who got his job because someone else of the same gender and ethnicity filled in for him at the aptitude test, you&#x27;ll quickly curse how HR people turn a blind eye to closely checking such stuff so they can meet their hiring quotas.<p>It&#x27;s not even inconceivable that someone like this has conned their way into running open source software projects, perhaps even project managing a &quot;Top 50&quot; programming language!",1405720900

I would say even happiness and satisfaction in life are much more dependent on the d/dt of your current situation than on the absolute values. In other words, one way to get out of a rut is to work on making each day slightly better than the previous one. Do this 7 days in a row, and you&#x27;ll marvel at what a great week you had.",1405720854

Anyone who suggests grid search for metaparameter tuning is out of touch with the consensus among experts in deep learning. A lot of people are coming out of the woodwork and presenting themselves as experts in this exciting area because it has had so much success recently, but most of them seem to be beginners. Having lots of beginners learning is fine and healthy, but a lot of these people act as if they are experts.",1405720841

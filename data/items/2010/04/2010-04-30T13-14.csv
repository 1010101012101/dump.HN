But I see very few people making a serious attempt to actually deliver the goods that will make Apple irrelevant.

It's out there, it's ubiquitous. The servers run whatever software you like; the clients run Javascript, which has its troubles but is not the worst of all possible worlds.

1308119,comment,1307465,1307465,0,0,crazydiamond,,,"> In MacRuby, all Ruby classes and objects are actually Objective-C classes and objects. There is no need to create costly proxies, convert objects, and cache instances. A Ruby object can be cast (toll-free) at the C level as an Objective-C object. The Ruby VM can also handle incoming Objective-C objects without conversion.<p>> In MacRuby, the primitive Ruby classes (e.g., String, Array, and Hash) have been re-implemented on top of their Cocoa equivalents (respectively, NSString, NSArray, and NSDictionary). As an example, all strings in MacRuby are Cocoa strings, so they can be passed directly to underlying C or Objective-C APIs. It is also possible to call any method of the String interface on any Cocoa string, subclass Objective-C methods, etc.<p>Interesting. Anyone used macruby, and would like to share experiences.<p>1. How is the learning curve for a ruby programmer ?<p>2. Are using the String and other core classes just the same as ruby, or more difficult / cumbersome.<p>3.

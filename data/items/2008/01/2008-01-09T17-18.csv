There will be some personalization, if you consider avatar photos distracting you will have an option to turn it off (and many other on/off options). There are 3 post just because I needed to create smaller screenshots :)<p>I still don't know where these links come finally. As you can see there is little gap at the bottom of the message for meta informations and maybe for comments/edit links, tags and so on ... its detail.<p>Link parsing feature has been created later, when link box in post form already existed ... I still don't know exactly how this will work at the end :)<p>I plan to run it on several sites with different topic/purpose ... I'm open to any suggestions. It's pitty some people can't understand it :)<p>pre-alpha or whatever you call it :) will run on the same URL.",1199901230

96389,comment,96010,96366,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Trying to increase your productivity by changing your intrinsic work ethic seems difficult and also inefficient.<p>How hard people work also depends to a large extent on the systemic environment in which the work takes place. The Hawthorne studies showed this back in the 20s. The basic idea was these researchers went to to study the effect of lighting on worker productivity. They went to this factory with two rooms, and they dimmed the lights in one and walked around and asked people how they felt about the change. The worker's output was measured in pieces produced, so it was easy to measure productivity. What they found was that when the room was dimmer, worker productivity increased. This didn't seem right to them, so they made the lights even dimmer and productivity increased again. And then they made it so it was almost pitch black and the productivity was at an all time high. What they found was that worker productivity was increasing due to having the scientists walk around and take interest in the factory workers. (I would have linked to the Wikipedia article, but it isn't very good.)<p>There are a whole series of studies since then showing that the idea that some people are hard workers and some people are lazy is misleading at best, because someone's work ethic is more determined by the environment than any intrinsic quality (although different people need different environments).<p>This is the same basic idea behind the Milgram experiments, where he showed that the majority of people had the capability to carry out the deeds of the Nazi's under the right systemic environment, and that the evil deeds of the Germans weren't so much intrinsic to the people themselves rather than the larger social system.<p>Even today there is a lot of really really valuable research coming out in this area. Just as an example, this is a good article on using psychology to motivate contributions to online communities:<p><a href=""http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol10/issue4/ling.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol10/issue4/ling.html</a><p>Bob Kraut has a lot of really good papers in this area relating to the Internet that are around online.",1199899015

Yes, non-tactile buttons aren't great for people who rely on touch - but that doesn't matter if there's a better interface that is accessible.<p>A visual person looks at an iphone and sees the touch screen as a series of hotspots, something akin to a button. But, it's a flat surface, it doesn't have to be interpreted as non-tactile buttons.<p>Look at an iphone touchscreen when the phone is switched off. Now look at a Macbook touchpad. If the touchpad - with no 'screen' behind it, or no display at all - how would you use that to navigate around the various features of an iPhone like OS?<p>Very quickly you'd land on the idea of gestures with spoken output. You'd create a navigation of gestures. Swipe left to move to the next application. Swipe right for the previous application. Double tap to activate the selected application. That's just for starters.<p>As the iphone demonstrates, there's a rich language for interacting with the device that seems to be enough to navigate around the various features of the phone.<p>Accessibility is about providing the equivalent functionality. No-one ever said the way of using it had to be the same, just equivalent. A different interaction allows access to the same functionality.<p>I remain deeply impressed with Apple for producing a mobile device that for the blind community absolutely rocks.

Most of them had never seen telephones with a cord and couldn't figure out how an object too big to fit in your pocket was supposed to be a phone.   :-)<p>I <i>think</i> this illustrates a long term problem with computer interfaces that mimic real world objects and/or interactions, even in the simple case of icons that resemble real-world objects.  The real world changes.  We haven't had to deal with that much yet, because visual computer user interfaces have only been prevalent so recently.   But as time wears on, I think this is only going to get more awkward.<p>As an example related to my story above, both the iPhone UI and the Android UI use an icon that looks like an old Bell telephone handset to represent the dialer.  That image still makes sense to <i>my</i> generation, but IMHO to my kids it's just gonna look like a wierd abstract symbol.  Similarly, many applications use an icon that looks like a Rolodex to represent the ""phonebook"" application.  Heck, I think I've got co-workers who've never seen a Rolodex!.",1271445415

IF the description was accurate (authorities will have to determine that), this was the scenario:<p>Magnatar aggressively bought the crappiest traunches of CDOs so that banks would be convinced to create more CDOs. The banks could then sell them, saying ""even the crappiest traunches are selling like hotcakes - you can confidently buy these less-risky traunches.""<p>But actually, even the least-risky traunches were VERY risky, and Magnatar was pushing to have riskier stuff included in the higher-level traunches, setting them up to fail. Meanwhile, Magnatar's inevitable losses on the crappy traunches were nothing compared to the bets (CDOs) they were taking against the CDO as a whole.<p>They might invest $10 million in the crappy traunches and effectively put an $100 million insurance policy on the CDO as a whole.<p>A good analogy would be if you bought houses next to a dam you thought would burst, thereby convincing developers to build more such houses, and you then took out large insurance policies on all the houses in the neighborhood. Except that you're not allowed to take out insurance on houses you don't own, which is sane, but you ARE allowed to buy credit default swaps on CDOs you don't own, which is a recipe for disaster.<p>So to the CDO investors in THOSE deals, at least, what the brokers told them was ""these investments are rated as super-safe and everybody is buying them - the magic of bundling takes away the risk of the underlying mortgages.""<p>When the reality was, the brokers KNEW that the CDOs were created with the help of someone who wanted them to fail, and the ratings agencies were being paid by the people who wanted the investments rated well. (Another insane situation - it would be like if the food safety inspectors were paid by McDonalds when they came out to check things. How can they be objective?)<p>Yes, there were investors who saw the crisis coming. But the banks did completely omit the fact that the investments were created, in part, by people who WANTED them to fail. If they had been up front about that, nobody would have bought them. So they lied, and had ratings agencies to back their lies.<p>Not exactly a situation where the investor has a reasonable chance to make informed decisions.",1271445140

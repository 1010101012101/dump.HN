But I think there is still room for a premium, convenience product. I've had access to free recipes forever, but I realize that doesn't help me. I need structure. I'm wondering if others are willing to pay for that same structure, but won't know for sure unless I collect CC info.<p>As for what is included, I am planning on launching with a few options for each component.

Especially in this simulation that offers both distance and focal length setting (which are, for this scene and 18-55mm focal length, mostly interchangeable), I'd like to have it. It'd also allow you to go (cheaply) to f/1.8 or f/1.4, which would be much better to illustrate the effect that aperture has on the depth of field. With a common f/3.5:5.6 kit lens and APS-C sensor, you won't get a shallow DOF and nice out-of-focus background easily, and that could be frustrating to a beginner.

I'd much rather work five days a week, 11am-5pm or 12pm-6pm, without a lunch break. Can you really put off your personal life every day from 9-6? I think the two biggest interruptions to a programmer's concentration are lunch (or other food) and meetings. Basically, anything that's on the clock.<p>If you want to reduce the total hours per week, doesn't it make more sense financially to work fewer hours per day but for five days and be able to pick up your kids at an earlier time each day? I would think that would be the case for most family folk. Don't your kids get off school or child care at somewhere around 3pm?

Friedrich Nietzsche criticized the phrase in that it presupposes that there is an ""I"", that there is such an activity as ""thinking"", and that ""I"" know what ""thinking"" is. He suggested a more appropriate phrase would be ""it thinks."" In other words the ""I"" in ""I think"" could be similar to the ""It"" in ""It is raining."" David Hume claims that the philosophers who argue for a self that can be found using reason are confusing ""similarity"" with ""identity"".

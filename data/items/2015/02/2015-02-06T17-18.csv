Screw one of those and it&#x27;s a deal breaker.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;d say that this decision is one that is particularly difficult to frame for the company. While corporations do understand direct costs very very well, they are practically hardwired to ignore/exploit the gift economy. So the discussion will be stirred towards what indirect benefits will the company receive from donating to a worthy cause (public relations, tax exceptions, etc) and away from the consequences of letting a (unacknowledged) strategic partner to go under.<p>Not to say that a corporation cannot assume stewardship of a distressed project, but it almost always requires executive fiat to get over the bureaucracy.",1423245588

He makes it very easy to change your mind.  Very easy to agree with him.

Right, we all get together, discuss what we&#x27;re working on.  It feels very collaborative.  But there will be this tool, this time-tracking system, that we&#x27;ll enter stuff into, and your name will be next to those things with a deadline.  If you don&#x27;t meet it, we&#x27;ll interact with you as an individual about why you aren&#x27;t meeting your deadlines.<p>&quot;Working software over comprehensive documentation&quot;. Again, sounds great.  Rather than spec&#x27;ing out every little detail, let&#x27;s work together iteratively to get the right product out.  Here&#x27;s the thing - you just allowed the people who are putting your name next to a task and a deadline to never commit to exactly what they&#x27;re trying to build and by when.  The deadlines are yours, but they&#x27;ll enjoy changing their minds, because, you know, &quot;agile.&quot;<p>&quot;Customer collaboration over contract negotiation&quot;.  The trap has been set, this is where it is sprung.  Most developers, I&#x27;ll guess, aren&#x27;t truly in contract situations where there are lawyers and signatures and so forth.  The tend to work on internal projects.  But make no doubt - if someone can turn to you and say &quot;you committed to getting X done by date Y&quot;, and it&#x27;s in there in the system, <i>you are in a contract situation</i>.  But because it was &quot;agile&quot;, you didn&#x27;t negotiate properly, and now you&#x27;ll get rolled.<p>&quot;Responding to change over following a plan&quot;.  I assure you they will hold your feet to the fire if you don&#x27;t follow the plain that was clearly in the &quot;contract&quot; and documented in the progress tracker system.  However, because it was &quot;agile&quot;, you never really got them to commit to what they were asking of you, so they retain the ability to change and adapt.  If it suits their purpose, so can you, if not, you&#x27;re &quot;in breach&quot;.  If it&#x27;s internal, this isn&#x27;t some lawsuit, it tends to be a sit down with people, including your manager (and perhaps a few other managers), where people act like they&#x27;re all here to solve a problem and get things back on track, with a heavy undercurrent that it&#x27;s your fault.<p>Standups, while not part of the manifesto, corrupt similarly.  Instead of &quot;here&#x27;s what I worked on yesterday, here&#x27;s how it went, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll work on today&quot;, they become a daily application of pressure and reminder of deadlines.  It appeals immensely to someone who would like micromanage a developer.  They&#x27;re meant to keep communication open in complicated projects where it can be difficult to make estimates under uncertainty (you know, a software project).  But they often end up with one person trying to explain complexity to an exasperated (and perhaps manipulative) person who really just wants to apply (often artificial) deadline pressure.<p>Unfortunately, &quot;agile&quot;, for all its promise, turned out to be amazingly fertile ground for manipulators.  I think this, more than anything else, is what has so badly damaged &quot;agile.&quot;<p>Waterfall seems like a discredited old system, and I don&#x27;t love it either, but it has a huge advantage for developers.  It requires people who will insist on and enforce deadlines to state upfront, in considerable detail, exactly what they want.",1423244966

More specifically these are all covered under well known morphological mechanisms that drive English word formation.<p>For example, in English, verbs and nouns have an unusually close relationship, it&#x27;s trivial and natural to verb nouns, especially when the verbed noun is obvious. This is an example of derivational morphology, and there&#x27;s all kinds of ways of doing this in different languages.<p>In English, among other neologistic processes, there&#x27;s also a process to compound common noun phrases.

9010293,comment,9009409,9009885,0,0,cottonseed,,,"It is important to distinguish between axioms (things you assume), definitions and theorem (things you prove from axioms, stated in terms of definitions).  So, for basic arithmetic, your assumptions might be the defining properties of numbers: associativity, distributivity, etc.  In this setting, 1 + 1 = 2 is basically a definition, while (-1)* (-1) = 1 is something to be proved:<p><pre><code>    0 = 0* (-1) (0* x = 0 for all x)
      = (1 + (-1))* (-1) (x + -x = 0)
      = 1* (-1) + (-1)* (-1) (distributivity)
      = (-1) + (-1)* (-1) (1* x = x for all x)
</code></pre>
implies:<p><pre><code>    1 = (-1)* (-1) (equality; add 1 to both sides)
</code></pre>
Finally, slope = rise/run is a definition.  It is not something you &quot;see&quot; to be true.<p>So assumption vs. definition vs. theorem can explain part of it.  Another part is familiarity.  1 + 1 = 2 is ubiquitous in daily life.  Depending on what you think about, (-1)* (-1) = 1 may not be.  You probably have lots of interpretations of 1 + 1 = 2 (counting, number line, shopping, money, etc.)  How many such interpretations of (-1)* (-1) = 1 do you have?<p>I highly recommend this book, written by two mathematicians:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/5-Elements-Effective-Thinking-ebook/dp/B008JUVDUE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1423244565&sr=1-1&keywords=5+elements+effective+thinking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/5-Elements-Effective-Thinking-ebook/dp...</a><p>It&#x27;s now about mathematics per se, but about learning how to learn and think better.

Now to talk about the MMR vaccine: It has had a rough go the last few decades.  It was reformulated a couple decades or so ago and the efficacy was massively reduced to around 30% or less if I remember correctly. They went back to the old formulation later but not after a full decade or more of using the new formula that didn&#x27;t really work.  In several of the measles outbreaks of the last decade or so - most, if not all, of those that got the measles had been vaccinated.

When I was little some children had polio and couldn&#x27;t walk properly, I didn&#x27;t know why at the time. Luckily they were the last ones and luckily I was vaccinated. However I had both measles and mumps, not a big deal but maybe only because I was little or because of proper treatment. I think every child at school had them sooner or later and all of them came back to school. We were the last ones not to be vaccinated against those diseases.<p>As an adult I got vaccinated against hepatitis, cholera, yellow fever, typhus, tetanus etc (I travel around the world on vacations). No consequences. Vaccination for me is an obvious choice. I can think that measles is easily survivable but I won&#x27;t expose a child of mine to polio. Get all the vaccinations they offer you, it&#x27;s a good investment.<p>However, if you don&#x27;t live a problem you don&#x27;t really appreciate it.

Even if the law says exactly what you want (which is Hard), the administrative burden of following and enforcing laws that complicated can exceed the benefits.<p>So if you&#x27;re stuck choosing between false positives and false negatives, the libertarian position falls out pretty quickly. Because in order to provide deterrence and account for less than 100% enforcement, the penalties for breaking the law are generally much higher than the societal cost of the crime, which means that the government convicting a good person has a much higher societal cost than the government not convicting a bad person. In other words, the laws should err on the side of things not being illegal.<p>But you&#x27;re applying this to government action. And there are certainly things government officers can do that justify removing them from the general population and to which the same principle applies. But we have another alternative in this case, which is to remove them from the government. The burden for firing government officers should be a lot lower than for putting them in prison, which means we should reasonably do it a lot more aggressively when there is even the slightest hint of misconduct.",1423243393

Whenever personal freedom produces large negative externalities, the law must mandate behaviours.<p>These mandated behaviours should be such that freedom is restricted by the minimum needed amount. As an unrelated example: smoking is not prohibited; Smoking in closed public spaces is.<p>For vaccination, I believe the sweet spot of mandated behaviour is to mandate vaccination of children participating in large public groups. Children that go to public schools must get vaccines. Children playing team sports must be vaccinated.<p>Parents then maintain the freedom of not vaccinating their kids, but must abide by the rules that prevent those kids from being a menace to the rest of the population.<p>Note that this is only needed because vaccines rely on &quot;herd protection&quot;. If vaccination coverage drops, vaccine efficacy drops precipitously. The effect is very pronounced. 90% coverage is much less effective than 99% coverage. Not vaccinating a child poses a risk for the child, but also poses a risk to all other children he/she is in regular contact with.<p>P.S. A lot of other discussions may arise: Government prohibitions tend to be slippery slopes; Children should be somewhat protected from their own parents; Should groups be allowed to skip vaccination altogether?.

The project I was on had its tasks written up in Excel spreadsheets, planned up to 2 years in advance.  The management discovered, after seven years, that things were not being done that should be done.<p>So they implemented daily stand-up meetings at exactly 8:50 am, including every single person on the development team, as well as all the testers.  The natural politicians on the team immediately pivoted towards writing down every bullshit thing they did during the day, so they could recite them the next morning as evidence of productivity.  Incidence of scheduled meetings that would require at least one of the seniors to be present exploded.<p>Every single one of those damned meetings was scheduled for 10 minutes, and lasted at least 30.<p>The stand-up is not the problem.  Incompetent management is the problem.  Management fads won&#x27;t do anything to address the underlying deficiencies.  The actual problem with that office is that smart and unethical developers are leading the incompetent managers around by the nose, using the very process and metrics that the managers had created to hide their lack of development knowledge.<p>As a result, the senior developers assigned themselves the privileged tasks that sound important but don&#x27;t actually require much work, assigned the grunt labor to juniors, and gamed every last one of the management metrics to make sure everyone on board with &quot;the program&quot; gets paid until the gravy train runs off the cliff.<p>So naturally, every last line of that code base is DailyWTF candidate material.  The management does not understand technical debt, so the seniors issued them high-interest loans from their own bank.<p>This is not the fault of the developers.  It is 100% the fault of the managers that allowed that toxic creature to take root.<p>So with respect to the question post, I suggest that the &quot;slow&quot; employees may actually be testing their new manager&#x27;s capability to manage them.  This is particularly relevant if any of them have ever worked for another company.<p>Assume they are trying to establish their own slack margin, so that they can safely read HN every morning, or some other equivalent time-waster, without falling behind on assigned tasks.  If so, implementing a daily stand-up will only confirm that you are a management novice that can be manipulated.<p>Just establish a tough, but fair, work standard, and check to see if the &quot;slow&quot; guys speed up in response, or continue to struggle for more hours.  For the former, you will need to court their favor by assuring them that good productivity will not be punished.  For the latter, you will need to continue their education by sharing the knowledge and experience you and the faster developers have acquired during your careers--but subtly, so as to not embarrass them before their peers.",1423243051

Of course they do. They have massive upsides, but they <i>invariably</i> have downsides, bad reactions, and so on, and it is the utter foolishness that so many try to paint it otherwise. The net result is of course a major positive -- if 1% of the population has an adverse reaction, but 10% avoids getting a painful disease, then a win for the whole (even if it sucks if you&#x27;re the 1%) -- but it is infantile if not ignorant to not only pretend these risks don&#x27;t exist (which is ridiculously common), but to actually question people&#x27;s own assessment of their risk profile.<p><a href=""http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/02/05/hpv-vaccine-gardasil-has-a-dark-side-star-investigation-finds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/02/05/hpv-vaccine-ga...</a><p>All of those incidents might very well be entirely coincidental.

9010038,comment,9008845,9008845,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"Congratulations and condolences. You are about to embark on a journey that is fraught with frustrating experiences. Having done something similar, here&#x27;s what I can tell you, though I consider my experience at best a mixed success.<p>First, focus on fundamentals. Spend time with the guys who are having trouble getting stuff done. Pair program with them, letting them drive. Or pair them up with one of the people who do work well.<p>Second, create effort estimates. No, really. Sit down and have these guys explain to you what they will do and estimate the amount of time. Tally it up as you go, then double it, telling them you want a margin of error (make sure to double it again when speaking to your boss, but don&#x27;t tell the developers that). Encourage them to speak with you immediately if they run into problems that will derail the estimate. This exercise will help a lot in terms of getting them to understand what they really should be doing.<p>Third, don&#x27;t be a micromanager. Assign a task, support them and check in periodically, but don&#x27;t push them to do things a certain way. I am really not a fan of the standing morning meeting. Instead, talk to them individually for 5 minutes every morning. It&#x27;s more of a pain, but it&#x27;s less stressful on them, which is good. At the same time, encourage them to talk to each other and do have an occasional team meeting (a quick one) explaining where you are heading.<p>Fourth, forget about programming. Sadly, you won&#x27;t have time for it. With a team this size, you might still have some time, but it&#x27;s best to lower your expectations dramatically. You&#x27;ll be doing quite a bit more thrashing between different tasks aimed at supporting your team. You know work for them, and your job is to keep them focused and productive. This really means two things: (a) don&#x27;t take on large or important projects or projects with major deadlines, and (b) don&#x27;t seize control of the system architecture. Why? Because you won&#x27;t have time for it, and will block the rest of the team while you do the research.<p>Fifth, and this is somewhat in conflict with #4, the buck stops with you. Example: my team wanted to switch from using Django&#x27;s built-in template system for Jinja2 without any real need to do so (we made very light use of the templates anyways; their argument was more of a preference). I listened, but ultimately said no. We had much bigger fish to fry, and this would have been a costly distraction with no upside. This was not a popular move, but the issue was let go after a few weeks.<p>Sixth, be honest with everyone about how things are going. If the devs are not pulling their weight, encourage them to get better. Offer help, guidance, etc. If they don&#x27;t improve, consider letting them go. If you are a team lead, chances are you don&#x27;t have that power, but surely your boss will want to know that the company is paying good money to the people who don&#x27;t do the work required.<p>Lastly, remember, as the lead, it&#x27;s your job to move the furniture out of the way for your team to get shit done. Your priorities have shifted, and now you are in a different role. The sooner you adapt to that mode, the better.<p>P.S.: Take vacations, and often.

Absolutely, but to the OP&#x27;s point, there is a much large proportion of Rails developers who take their job seriously as a professional than those who do it for small freelancing gigs, for the lulz, etc. Furthermore, many of the issues that you have to teach traditional PHP developers, are &quot;solved problems&quot; by those in other languages/frameworks (Laravel/Symfony are good examples of where those problems are solved).<p>> <i>Any respectable PHP developer nowadays uses a decent framework, and there are many.

There is at least a small amount of evidence to suggest that crossings and even a trickle of trade pre-dated the Vikings:<p><a href=""http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/ethnic/mummy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/ethnic/mummy.htm</a><p>Other circumstantial evidence includes architecture and burial customs among South American native civilizations that could be interpreted as Egypt-influenced. Yet the majority of scientists greet these claims with extreme skepticism. How could the ancients have crossed the Atlantic? With what? Long boats?<p>When a great, almost mythic feat is not repeated for a very long time, people will begin to doubt it. That&#x27;s not new and it&#x27;s not because &quot;people are stupid.&quot; It&#x27;s because people lie and exaggerate a lot, and thus people respond to that by being skeptical of grandiose claims. It also doesn&#x27;t help that governments often lie as a matter of standard policy, a fact that <i>very rationally</i> leads people to be generally skeptical of what they say.<p>If our civilization fell and another rose in thousands of years, I&#x27;d expect that many would respond with tremendous incredulity to the idea that the ancients visited the Moon with primitive metal tubes full of fossil fuel and discrete component computers. How absurd. Instead, they would reason, this was obviously some sort of national <i>myth</i> and a part of the American cult of state -- the rocket is an obvious phallic symbol and it being full of oil represented petroleum as the basis of American power, etc.<p>The only way to disabuse people of the moon hoax theory is to go back to the Moon (or further).<p>I happen to think we went to the Moon. I also happen to think it&#x27;s at least <i>possible</i> that ancients (Egyptians, Phoenicians, etc.) crossed the Atlantic. But I guess I&#x27;m a bit of an optimist about what humans can do when they really put their minds to it... with tubes full of fossil fuel, or long boats. :)",1423242145

Depending on the API, you need to be careful performance-wise.

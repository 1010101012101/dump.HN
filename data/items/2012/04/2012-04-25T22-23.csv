Mobile is replacing console just like console replaced arcades. Which also had much better hardware and controlers, and games that didn't fit the console style. Until consoles' hardware evolved... and arcades died. Likewise, mobile hardware is evolving. There's nothing stopping you from building a android box with 10x the CPU power of an xbox, plug controllers in it, have instant access to many more games in the Play Store that all consoles together ever had. Then develop games with much better graphics than current AAA titles.<p>And I'm personally betting (literally) that both Apple and Android OEMs are already working on this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/bcousins/when-the-consoles-die-what-comes-next"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/bcousins/when-the-consoles-die-wha...</a>",1335394488

We elect them.  Ultimately it is our fault for allowing it.  Then some of these folks appoint people to other positions.  The appointments are probably worst than the already-challenged elected official.<p>When I hear someone carry the ""corporate greed and corruption"" flag I have a viscerally negative reaction to the statement.  I don't know you, so I can't know where you are coming from.  To be clear, what I am about to say has nothing to do with you and is not aimed or intended to represent you at all.<p>Whenever I've heard this from people in person that either I know or have an opportunity to learn more about the profile almost always falls within a certain range.  Liberal, democrat, sometimes government worker or union member, no entrepreneurial experience, no understanding of the business process and no experience attempting to launch and run a business.<p>A lot changes once you've experienced the realities of business.  I can't name one business driven purely by greed other than boundary examples such as the Madoff mess.  Even the most maligned financial companies have to sell a product and cater to a customer base.  Oil companies, for example, are a favorite punching bag.  Are they driven by greed?  Of course not!  They sell a product.  And they sell a product that requires huge investment.  They are perfectly entitled to earn a profit and they are entitled to earn as much as the market will support.  Supply and demand.  If they take legally allowed action to enhance their standing or ability to compete, well, that's the law.  Until it is changed they are doing nothing different than engaging in the ""SEO"" of their industry.<p>Somehow there's an automatic trigger point that says that large companies are driven by nothing but greed.  Really?  At what revenue level does greed become the underlying driving force?  What where they driven by until they got to that level?  I don't see anyone talking about companies such as Apple that way?  Why?  They are large.  Very large.  They don't do anything any other enterprise does not do.  They manufacture in China.  So do others, except that, when it is Ford that does it ""they are greedy"" is the first response.<p>Anyhow, let's agree to disagree.

And it has to do that over and over, for every source file that includes that header.<p>So if the compiler stashes away a binary representation of the contents of that header, then it can skip the slow bits of reading the text file and figuring out its contents and all.

What does that product let you do? Be social, within its confines, and connect to everyone you ever knew, sharing links, photos and text snippets.  Yeah, there's a lot of end-user value in that and, for as long as they can ride the power-law effects, Facebook will be an ad-revenue generating monster.<p>Google, on the other hand, has a suite of tools that lets people do almost everything else in the online world. Search is moving ever so slowly into the 3D/""real-world"" through maps and product searches and now the goggles project (if it stands the test of time, of course).<p>In short, google helps its users manage their worlds whereas Facebook manages people in the Facebook world.  Without significant expansion and diversification, Facebook has a much more precarious position, at least as far as producing end-user value goes.<p>Thus far, that innovation and expansion has been what? Facebook connect? Putting ""like"" buttons all over the web and tracking my every move? That's not value for the average Facebook user (for advertisers? sure, very much).  So, what else? Letting me share all of my activities like what music I'm listening to, etc? All of that happens within the facebook walled garden  and that tactic makes the whole thing a bet the house gamble.  As long as people stay with FB, it works, but once they drift away, it all falls apart just as quickly as it grew.

3891368,comment,3890670,3890896,1,0,klint,,,"I'll take another stab at explaining this:<p>Originally everything was done on dumb terminal connecting to mainframes. Then we got PCs and workstations that could run client-server applications where there UI lived on the workstation but the data still lived on a server. So let's say you have an inventory app with a desktop client. When you search for an item, the application does a query and returns a list of results from the database. You then select the one you want, it does another query and downloads some more data from the database. Then you makes some changes to the item and commit them to the database. The client uploads the change to the database by performing another query. This all works pretty well over a LAN because the server.<p>If something goes wrong with the server, or if your network switch or network card stops working, then the app stops working. But if you have good gear and a good IT team, that's relatively rare. You can get your work done.<p>Then along came Web applications. These made IT's life easier because instead of deploying a desktop client to everyone's machine, they can just install the software on the server and everyone can connect to it. It still works mostly the same way your desktop client did, except now the UI elements are downloaded to your browser when you visit the site rather than being permanently stored on your desktop.<p>Where things get hairy is when you're trying to access these types of systems over the Internet. There's more latency, everything seems slower. Then suddenly everyone wants access from a smart phone, where their connection speed is slower and it can drop in and out. So you start using AJAX to put more UI elements on the client side, but you're still making database calls for each action you perform.<p>So one thing that's new in these tools is that more data is cached locally. So your inventory app would actually download a whole bunch of data all at once so that you can query it locally, without having to hit the server each time. That creates a bunch of new problem, like handling conflicts, authentication, etc.<p>Another thing that's new is that there's a thinner, or perhaps non-existent, layer between the client application and database server (in the desktop client-server model, you might also have been able to connect directly to the database, depending on the architecture, so that's not necessarily all that new. I don't know enough yet about how Lotus Notes databases work, but I know that they're the direct ancestor to CouchDB).",1335391685

As far as I can tell Gates approached this as an optimisation problem: given that he has X billion dollars to give to charity, how can he maximise the effect that his donations have? How many lives can he save* with that money?<p>* lives saved is of course the wrong metric: no-one has ever saved a live, just prolonged it, but it's a convenient shorthand for maximising the number of quality adjusted life years (QALYs)[1] that a donation could buy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year</a>",1335391376

It would be a risky bet either way. You can't be sure how much more you'll be able to make your earnings grow in the future, just as you can't be sure if your charities will pay out.<p>And the longer you wait, the longer those charities you could have been investing on, are not seeing any benefits.<p>So you have two balance these two: Wait too long and charities of today don't see much benefit. Wait too little and you might be unable to grow your money and do less overall charity in the future. How do you know what's the right point in your career? Ideally, you wanna start donation when you're at the top of your career. And don't wanna risk falling from where you are.<p>After the recent investments maybe Andreessen Horowitz think they got to that point. They've got more money than ever and it's getting riskier to wait longer. So they considered that balance and judged it was the right time to donate to charity. You might disagree with their timing. But hey, remember they're pretty good at this stuff, so maybe they're right :)",1335391369

5938274,comment,5936652,5936652,2,0,masswerk,,,"Now, I really do not consent with the terminology given in the article. Here&#x27;s an alternative description:<p>In the old days of computer jargon a hacker would be someone who would be able to optimize the hell out of a code by exhibiting a crystalline beauty in his code at the same time. He would achieve his goals sometimes by unexpected means and ways. He would take pride in his code, which could not have been produced in an industrial fashion.<p>In the even as old debate of art vs engineering, an engineer would be the more bovine species. In reality a good software engineer is someone who doesn&#x27;t focus just on the brilliance of code, but (also) on the aspects of its social production. (Is the architecture suitable to be broken up into programmers&#x27; tasks? Is the algorithm understandable? Is it maintainable? Often it&#x27;s better to go for a more mediocre solution in terms of code efficience and rather have a reproducible and maintainable expression of the underlying ideas than some kind of mind twisting wizardry in your code base.) A software engineer is focused on the production of code as an industrial process.<p>A developer comes in all flavors, occupying any position in this continuum. He might be a hacker, but knows about the limitations of industrial processes. Generally, a developer is expected to be focused more on the task than on the social process of its production. He &quot;speaks&quot; his languages and knows the APIs by heart. You could say, he&#x27;s centered on solutions, often encapsulating his knowledge and achievements in opaque libraries for the benefit of more earthly users.<p>And for the term hacker as used in the article, someone who&#x27;s just poking around and not really knowing what he/she is doing? Isn&#x27;t there a word like &quot;script kiddy&quot;? (Yes, the classic hacker was also poking around, but to be considered a true hacker, this would lead to supreme knowledge and insight in the system that would even transcend the ones of the system&#x27;s designers.)<p>Not that this could be claimed to be more true in any way, it&#x27;s just an alternative description.
But as for me, it&#x27;s rather a question of attitude than of levels of skills.",1372150745
5938273,comment,5937977,5938227,7,0,ColinWright,,,"Yes, I read what you are being snarky about.  It seems to me that what you have done is said &quot;What a load of crap&quot; without actually adding any value.  What you <i>haven&#x27;t</i> done is provide a clear, well-thought out contrary point of view.<p>I would be interested in reading an incisive, constructive reply, but if all you&#x27;re going to do is criticize without being informative or constructive, then I guess you really are somewhat like a eunuch in a harem.<p>So here, PG wrote this (and you quoted it):<p><pre><code>    &quot;Books on philosophy per se are either highly technical
    stuff that doesn&#x27;t matter much, or vague concatenations
    of abstractions their own authors didn&#x27;t fully understand
    (e.g. Hegel).

    It can be interesting to study ancient philosophy, but
    more as a kind of accident report than to teach you
    anything useful.&quot;
</code></pre>
So he&#x27;s saying that the study of philosophy doesn&#x27;t really teach you anything useful, and he says broadly why.  You seem to take exception to this, but you don&#x27;t say why.  You don&#x27;t say what it is that developers, or others, can gain from studying philosophy.  You don&#x27;t provide a counter-argument, or any kind of alternative viewpoint.  You simply declare him to be pompous.<p>That seems unconstructive to me.<p>So returning to your comment:<p><pre><code>    Did you read what I&#x27;m criticizing?
</code></pre>
Yes, I did.<p><pre><code>    You mustn&#x27;t have if you&#x27;re saying I&#x27;m
    &quot;unable to do it myself&quot;.
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s an odd deduction, and I don&#x27;t see how you came to the conclusion.  You have provided zero evidence of anything except the fact of your disagreement.  I would like to see a well-constructed counter-argument.<p><pre><code>    How is this quote any more coherent or
    well-structured or less snarky than my
    comment was?
</code></pre>
Perhaps it isn&#x27;t, but it was in the context of the preceeding paragraph which asked for a more complete reply, rather than a snarky dismissal.<p>Will you offer one?  I am genuinely interested to see the alternate point of view explained clearly and well.",1372150734

It provides a straightforward way to pin an entire zone tree while allowing site owner modifications. Your example of Ghadaffi and Bit.ly is silly, because the status quo is that governments already have access to CA keys able to issue for any server. Restricting to a single zone can only improve that.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you can claim NSEC3 is a grotesque hack without noting that it is equally grotesque to pretend that your DNS records are private.

Regardless of the fact that he has an MBA and a technical background, he cheerfully admits he was wrong and tries to do a better job managing expectations in the future. I&#x27;ll provide a blow-by-blow analysis.<p>>>We need to under promise and over deliver.<p>Great! But, why? There has to be a concrete, preferably measurable, reason(s) to have this mindset. As other commentators noted, what he did wasn&#x27;t really under-promising, but simply adhering to the original schedule, which implies that the customer was on-board with the agreed timeline.<p>>>The project moved along and thanks to some long days we actually managed to deliver functionality ahead of schedule.<p>What did he expect to get out of this? What did he tell the team to justify this?<p>>>We continued our iterations, tuning functionality and consistently over delivering when the team started to become disgruntled and exhausted.<p>Even with the right motivation, burnout is a constant issue for services staff in any industry, especially when the engagement lead doesn&#x27;t monitor both sides (customer and internal). He would have monitored this more closely, or would not even have gone down that path if his internal team were billing him on an hourly basis, as it would have forced him to more concretely justify to himself and his partners what he expected to get out the self-imposed accelerated schedule.<p>>>To continue to over deliver, the team had been working very long hours, weekends and some had missed important family appointments.<p>Live and learn. Seems like you are somewhat charismatic, or have a hold on your employees that made them put in the long hours and miss family time without pushing back on you.<p>>>The next day we presented to the client, they were surprised at what wed achieve in such a short time and were happy that we were ahead of schedule.<p>As engagement manager, you should have ensured that this wasn&#x27;t a surprise to the customer! It would have allowed you to more quickly gauge whether (a) it&#x27;s worth continuing on the death march and (b) how the customer will react.<p>>>The discussion turned to the next set of deliverables, the effort and the expected delivery dates. This is where it all started to fall apart.<p>No -- we need to be very clear here. Things started to fall apart well before this due to: (i) lack of identifying value exchange for the death march on the first deliverable; (ii) lack of continual communication with the customer.<p>>>Why cant you do it? Were not asking for anything more, its actually less than what you delivered before.<p>The standard answer here is:<p>(i) We can&#x27;t do it because the first deliverable was a one-off to help you reduce time-to-market / internal target date, but this second deliverable will require additional staff that I don&#x27;t have. From a resourcing perspective, I&#x27;m not going to charge you for the additional hours that my staff spent on the accelerated schedule for the first deliverable because I made that decision unilaterally. We must stick to the same duration for the second deliverable.<p>(ii) I know you&#x27;re not asking for anything more; that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re able to commit to our originally agreed upon deliverable duration (e.g. 2 weeks), and nothing shorter.<p>(iii) If you want us to work weekends, as per the Statement Of Work (&quot;SOW&quot;) that you signed, you&#x27;ll need to pay for the additional weekend and holiday staff shifts for the second deliverable [context: sounded like the OP did in fact have a contract in play, and hopefully had language in the SOW that covered increase in base rates for weekend & holidays]. We&#x27;ll swallow the increase in costs for the first deliverable because we did it of our own volition.<p>(iv) I&#x27;m glad that we confirm our original agreement regarding the nature, specificity and scope of the second deliverable (i.e. that it is &quot;less than what you delivered before&quot;). This further emphasizes that our originally agreed upon duration for the second deliverable is firm and we can deliver with the agreed upon duration.<p>>>Over the next few meetings, with significant effort, the discussions started to turn around. I had been reborn and now realised:<p>There&#x27;s hope for you yet! In most situations, this is where the customer escalates, goes over your head and tries to get you off the project, or where the firm partner/general manager tries puts a PIP on your record because your customer relationship management skills (the number one reason you&#x27;re typically chosen to become an engagement manager) was so severely lacking. Seriously, that was a great turnaround if the OP did that himself.<p>>>Its not about the effort, its about the outcome. The client did not care how much effort wed put in.<p>In general, this is true. However, as part of your job you are supposed to tie in the effort with the outcome, whether via narrative, task-based estimate or simply pure dollar terms. Do this, and your job becomes easier explaining timelines and pricing deliverables.<p>>>We needed to become a partner<p>Yep. However, as part of your job, you must be cognizant when a psychopathic or aggressive customer has no interest in becoming a partner and only extracting as much value as possible out of the current deal. Customers can flip, and engagement managers must always be taking the customer&#x27;s temperature to protect the deal, the team, and the deal margin.<p>>>The expectations had to be reset<p>As others noted in this thread, they weren&#x27;t managed properly. OP was fine up until the kick-off when the baseline timeline was established and agreed upon, but then went off plan for no compelling reason(s).<p>>>As painful as this was, it did teach me a lot. Get on top of this before it blows out.<p>Amen.<p>>>Under promising and over delivering is for suckers.<p>This last sentence is wrong. Forget about under promising. Just focus on the over-delivering part. Only over-deliver if you have the appropriate risk appetite, enough deal margin you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice, and compelling exchange of value. Examples of exchanges of value are:<p>(i) &quot;If we make a great impression that is sustainable in the long run, we can leverage this influential customer for references in the future!&quot; --> Make sure your sales team has the balls to follow-through on this. Surprisingly, many organizations and field teams have a hard time asking for references for future deals.<p>(ii) &quot;When we were talking, the customer kept referring to feature X that&#x27;s gating the next phase of their program and holding up future deals. If we deliver a proof of concept showing that we can deliver this functionality, it might clear the obstacle for future services deals.&quot; --> Make sure your product/engineering group can deliver, and that your support group will actually support the new &#x27;feature&#x27; that you deliver.<p>(iii) &quot;The customer is asking us to bring in the schedule. We&#x27;ve got no other deals on the table and all of our guys would be on the bench (i.e. idle) otherwise. Let&#x27;s swallow the cost for a short period of time.&quot; --> Engagement manager needs to go into &#x27;expectation management&#x27; overdrive and find a narrative that works for both parties.",1372149302

I was actually somewhat relieved to see people actually caring about their fourth amendment rights in a way that they haven&#x27;t in far too long.<p>In all honesty, I think that Snowden&#x27;s continued media presence is actually hurting his cause.  Between the smear campaign by the current administration (and press) and the casual comments he&#x27;s made that has lost people on his cause, he might be keeping the story going, but the story is shifting more to one of <i>ad hominem</i>, and less of one on the issue at hand.<p>The populace at large is terribly bad at keeping issues like this in pragmatic focus.  Too few realize that even if Satan himself had been the one to leak this information, that we&#x27;re all better off for having known it; and I&#x27;d hope that it would give some Americans pause enough to consider the actual implications of the Constitution; whether or not the government can govern through the consent of the governed, for example, if they have secret governings, or whether or not the non-delegation clause of the Constitution should actually allow for the NSA (staffed with officials we can&#x27;t vote in or out) to write laws, when the Constitution specifically enumerates that law-making power resides in Congress alone.<p>So while ultimately, all that boils down to is ARGHHHHH MY FOURTH AMENDMENT, it&#x27;s also an opportunity to have a larger discussion on what that fourth amendment actually means, and what other parts of the Constitution might come into play, and whether or not it&#x27;s fair that the government has extended its power to such the degree that we can have 300 different &quot;agencies&quot; like the CPPABSD (Committee for Purchase From People who are Blind or Severely Disabled -- they regulate how many coke and vending machines <i>other</i> government agencies should purchase from strictly blind or severely disabled sources), each of which is allowed to write laws that do not pass Congress, do not pass the house, and aren&#x27;t subject to the oversight of the citizenry.

I haven&#x27;t laughed that hard at something I read in a blog post so far this year. And I agree wholeheartedly.<p>Who gives a shit about Google Reader the website?

Thinking on it a moment more, I realized I would pay some reasonable fee for it.<p>However, non-free means 99% of people won&#x27;t use it, and this in turn means that there is much less incentive for the makers of said fast, awesome, native newsreaders to support such a service in their app.<p>Except that an RSS newsreader that cannot sync is kind of like a dog turd in a bowtie.<p>An enterprising newsreader maker could bite the bullet and make sync a feature of their app -- but I don&#x27;t think any of the good newsreader apps cover all the important platforms (for me, Mac, iOS, and Android, but for others Windows and Linux are probably in the mix, too).<p>So I don&#x27;t know what the solution is.",1372148827

The question is &quot;does what I&#x27;m doing fit within the bounding space I can exert full control over.<p>Salt as an &#x27;ecosystem&#x27; has capabilities that extend more into this area. Salt Cloud and the Salt Bootstrap script are 2 of the things that I feel invalidate some of the argument that tools like Salt ( I wont comment on the Chef & Puppet ecosystems ) are capable of operating much closer to your aim than you give them credit for.<p>For starters, I&#x27;d quit before letting a boss tell me their precious snowflake AMI was &#x27;more stable&#x27; and I shouldnt waste any time trying to ensure I can recreate it should someone delete the image. In my own workflow, Salt is step 1 in any system. I build a stand alone salt configuration that can from bare OS image on first boot, initialize salt, and then pull the system forward to the desired state. Then for cloud roll out, the next step is to take an image of that VM/Container which I can then replicate much faster.<p>And one of my long terms plans is to hammer Buildbot, Salt, Salt Cloud, and a lot of time into a system that gives end to end control. Now if only I could code a decent UI for it... putting bootstrap on months of work would feel cheap lol.",1372148432

5938159,comment,5937495,5937847,5,0,vec,,,"First, resist the urge to put code in your templates.  Because the syntax is the same, it&#x27;s very tempting to just declare a function or do a query in the middle of your HTML.  You&#x27;ll be happier in the long run if you don&#x27;t ever get into that habit to begin with.  PHP actually recognizes both .php and .phtml as valid file extensions.<p>I personally try to follow a couple basic rules.  .php files should be a single <?php ?> block with nothing outside it, and .phtml files shouldn&#x27;t use anything but if, foreach, and already defined variables.  You&#x27;ll end up with code that&#x27;s both cleaner and better structured.<p>Second, if at all possible avoid Wordpress until you&#x27;ve already got a firm grasp of the language.  Wordpress itself has a few decisions that made sense in PHP 4 but are terrible practice now (like using global functions instead of classes) and a few others that, while not technically wrong, were questionable even then (the loop).  On top of that, the quality of code in third party themes and plugins varies wildly.  If you copy the techniques you see there, you&#x27;ll learn some awesome tricks, but you&#x27;ll also learn every bad practice in the book.  Until you&#x27;ve got enough experience to recognize the difference, you&#x27;ll do yourself more harm than good.",1372148084

I walked really far and passed many people who I assume were homeowners based on how they were dressed (no shoes/bags/purses or beach toys) and acting (walking close to the houses etc). All offered polite smiles and several let their dogs run up to me and seemed to expect me to pet/play with them. Not a single person gave me an odd or disapproving look - though one couple (really old white guy with a 20-something black girl) went pretty far out of their way to avoid the path I was walking on. I figured at least one of them was famous or something, as the reason.<p>When I was leaving though, I went back past Geffen&#x27;s house (only way out) and what I assume was his private security guard (plainclothes but looked like a Marine) came walking straight at me staring at me and then got in a car in the driveway. I look across the street to my car and I see a cop car parked in the turning late in the middle of the road with two cops in it. I decided to take an extra long time wiping the sand off of my feet to soak it all in. The security guy eventually pulled the car out of the driveway and alongside the cops, I assume they were talking through open windows but with traffic and distance couldn&#x27;t hear. Then the guy pulls his car in front of the cops in the turning lane, does a U-Turn and parks right in front of my car on the opposite side of the street.<p>There was no cross-walk and I didn&#x27;t want to give the cops a reason to legally harass me, so I walked on the sidewalk right in front of David Geffen&#x27;s house and gestured to the cops asking if I could cross the street illegally. They both just sorta shrugged and looked back at traffic and nodded - meaning if you want to risk getting hit by a car, go for it.<p>So after a couple of minutes with these cops staring right at me, I find an opening and dart over to my car. The whole time the security dude is still sitting there parked in front of my car. I put my stuff inside and pull away, on the left two cops are staring at me driving off and on the right the security dude is also staring at me. I waved to all three of them and drove away.<p>So I can confirm the beach is public and the homeowners seem like really nice people who don&#x27;t mind that at all - other than David Geffen, who seems to try to use his private security and the police to intimidate people into not using the path.<p>I&#x27;m taking a date back there tomorrow.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/fashion/sundaystyles/05beach.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/fashion/sundaystyles/05bea...</a>",1372148082

They used your public key to encrypt incoming mail and store it until you wanted to log in to view it (which is a fundamentally reasonable approach; the problem is compatibility with existing mail clients, and search, but you can solve that by downloading to a local mail client using something &quot;special&quot; and running search locally as well.)<p>The enemy made Hushmail serve a &quot;bad&quot; applet to certain users which (in addition to decrypting) sent back either credentials or key to hushmail (and thus allowed decrypting of the mail).<p>There are ways to address this attack but they&#x27;re essentially in the realm of release engineering and separation of control; you have one group develop, another group serve, another group execute, and the groups have to be mutually distrustful and audit everything that passes between them.

(an adequate solution for java applets would have been putting the signing key under neutral third-party control; I don&#x27;t think a java applet based solution is viable today, since java is such a clusterfuck; I&#x27;d just do a secure iOS or Android app instead and stick to mobile users, like silenttext does from silentcircle).<p>I&#x27;d personally skip webmail or even desktopmail and just build something which is mobile-secure-mail/messages/voice.<p>Silentcircle is my favorite voice product right now, but it&#x27;s fundamentally doomed (IMO) due to being commercial on both sides.

He was livid and described it as feeling like he had been &quot;raped.&quot;<p>Things are changing, but this remains generally true.<p>If you were absentmindedly touching me, my judgement of that would depend on a great many factors. I have had male friends who were honest to god just friends.<p>Again, I drew my conclusions about the man in question based on a great many factors. It wasn&#x27;t any one thing. But the touching really stood out, in part because he smacked me hard enough one day that I felt assaulted. I chose to not contact HR.

Since you are trapped in your torus, it will take time communicate it.<p>But it&#x27;s not like the coin is sending messages to itself to say, &quot;if someone looks at the other side, make sure it is tails&quot;.  It just is.  Similarly, it is not in a determined state at the point of entaglement.  It is only determined when one party looks at it.

When you download something onto your device, it is now yours to remix and play with in any way you want – provided you don’t republish it and make money from it.<p>That&#x27;s like saying it&#x27;s moral to download the free trial of adobe, and then modify it so it doesn&#x27;t shut off access to the software after 30 days or call home or require payment, because hey it&#x27;s your device and you can do whatever. It&#x27;s ridiculous reasoning. Obviously the whole morality of adblocking isn&#x27;t black and white, but at the end of the day, when a content-creator makes something and is willing to share it with you for free on a single condition which is that you keep the ads intact, you&#x27;re either supposed to accept that, or reject the content. Taking the free content and rejecting the condition of the ads isn&#x27;t simply completely fine because it happens to have landed on a device you own. There are plenty of well known arguments for and against that are reasonable, this isn&#x27;t one of them. If you actually already paid for the content (like in the NYT example he follows up the above quote) then sure, you can do whatever, that&#x27;s the principle behind gamers wanting a right to mod their games for personal.",1443139797

While ripping off the cloak from the \n   hermit the villagers were shocked because they uncovered \n   rows of sharp and triangular teeth within huge jaws. A \n   shark god had been caught. \n\n   It was clear that the missing villagers had been eaten \n   by the god on their journeys to the sea. The men\n   mercilessly tore the shark god into pieces, burned him \n   and threw the ashes into a tide pool near the harbour of \n   Hana. Shortly after, a thick brown moss started to grow \n   on the walls of the tide pool causing instant death to \n   victims hit by spears smeared with the moss. Thus was \n   the evil of the demon. The moss growing in the cursed \n   tide pool became known as &quot;limu-make-o-Hana&quot; which \n   literally means &quot;seaweed of death from Hana.&quot;[3] The \n   Hawaiians believed that an ill curse came over them \n   if they tried to collect the deadly seaweed.[9]\n</code></pre>\nSo, there&#x27;s that.<p>In reality you usually have to go looking for trouble with this stuff in order to be affected by it.

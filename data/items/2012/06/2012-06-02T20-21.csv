Nonetheless, it shouldn't be contrary to your expectations, if you apply a little wisdom.<p>I find in my own case that the things which bug me about others are things which deeply bug me about myself. Whenever I find my heart beating a little harder and my brow a little furrowed, I try to relax, and take a deep breath, and see what it is within <i>me</i> which <i>resonates</i> so strongly against the error that I have seen. I am normally quite patient with error, and this usually causes my impatience.<p>Personally, I feel this ""what is wrong with <i>me</i>"" redirection is a much deeper lesson than the fact that harsh moderation can help keep a community together. First off, it is a discipline which can help keep <i>us</i> together, as opposed to the communities we moderate. And second, because the original lesson comes embedded in a much deeper truth, which Eliezer doesn't seem to acknowledge. I would like to spend a moment on this:<p>The deeper truth is that <i>love is transformative</i>, that to love is to change both yourself and your beloved. The original post just notes that if a moderator isn't moderating, they aren't loving their community. True enough. It is important, however, to understand that transformation is not <i>sufficient</i> for love: that we all know people who do use their authority too far.<p>Well-kept gardens don't die due to pacifism. That's stupid -- if they did, then they weren't ""well-kept"". But they die because they don't get the love that they need. It doesn't matter how much you pull the weeds if you forget to water the roots and fertilise the soil.<p>To any of you who wish to know whether they love their job, I will simply add the poignant questions: when did you last transform it? And when did it last transform you?",1338670451

There is a possible universe (possible with respect to my current logical uncertainty) in which communities are necessarily reliant on vigilance to survive. There is also a possible universe where there are fundamentally stable solutions to this problem. In such a universe, a community can survive the introduction of many malicious or misguided users because its dynamics are good rather than because its moderator is vigilant. I strongly, strongly suspect that we live in the second universe. If we do, I think trying to solve this problem is important (fostering intelligent discourse is more important than the sum of all existing online communities). I don't mean saying ""lets try and change karma in this way and see what happens;"" I mean saying, ""lets try and describe some properties that would be desirable for the dynamics of the community to satisfy and then try and implement a system which provably satisfies them.""",1338670194

Besides if you watch a highly non technical user use a computer they will often do things in incredibly inefficient ways and don't seem to worry about it too much.<p>I think the key though is making it as difficult as possible to get stuck when trying to do a particular task. This is where consistency is hugely important, if most of your apps work approximately the same way (such as with Apple) and have predictable behavior this is hugely helpful to users.<p>There is also a lot of context to bear in mind when thinking about how easy something is to use and I think this is where it does a disservice to lump ""non technical"" users together.<p>For example , I grew up during the days of DOS so switching to a UNIX/BASH command line when I got older felt very natural to me.

4059060,comment,4058818,4058818,1,0,kijin,,,"I've seen this article posted here multiple times, and every time a few people seem to misunderstand the conclusion of this article. As far as I can tell, Yudkowsky's point is not that online communities need strong moderators. His main conclusion is that people should make judicious use of downvotes.<p>> <i>But that was not a karma system, actually.</i><p>> <i>Hereyou must trust yourselves.</i><p>> <i>You have the downvote.  Use it or USENET.</i><p>In old BBS systems, a handful of moderators were given the task of sorting out good posts from bad posts. We might say that those were the days of benevolent dictators. But of course, this raises the question of how people can trust those dictators to be benevolent all the time. In most cases, moderators do act in the best interest of the community, but sometimes they go on power trips, and when they do, it makes everyone question whether it was a good idea to give all those powers to moderators in the first place. That's exactly what happens in real-world politics, too, whenever you give a lot of power to a person or institution.<p>Nowadays, virtually every Internet community allows users to vote on everything. One might say that this is more ""democratic"" than relying on moderators alone to sort out good posts from bad posts, because now everyone participates in the task of moderation. This can also be more efficient, because really bad posts will often be downvoted into oblivion even before a mod has had a chance to look at it. But like any real-world democracy, a voting system has its limits. There will have to be mechanisms to prevent circlejerks, and communities will still need moderators to carry out certain tasks. The difficult question, as usual, is how to design a fair, effective, and transparent division of labor between participatory democracy (upvotes/downvotes) and top-down administration (mods).<p>Whenever mods in a subreddit come up with plans to clean up what they perceive to be a mess, there are always people who argue that such measures are unnecessary because people can just downvote what they don't want to see in that subreddit. But you can't rely on either method alone. Strong moderation will be futile if people keep upvoting pun threads in a science subreddit. Downvoting will have limited efficacy in the absence of a mechanism to kick out the most egregious offenders.<p>Fortunately, some kind of balance between the two extremes is what most subreddits eventually settle with. An efficient democracy is neither fully managed by elites nor completely dependent on every shift of public opinion. It's all about checks and balances. Moderators need to be kept accountable to ordinary users who can call out when they see a power trip. Ordinary users need to be kept accountable, too, by means of a fair and consistent enforcement of forum rules.<p>None of this, of course, invalidates Yudkowsky's arguments.<p>> <i>Waiting until the last resort of absolute, blatent, undeniable egregiousness ... waiting until you can be certain you are in the right, and fear no questioning looks ... is waiting far too late.</i><p>Science can never reach absolute certainty, right? Only hypotheses that have yet to be falsified. But the lack of absolute certainty does not, and should not, prevent people from making judgments on the basis of the best available evidence. You can act even if you're not certain -- as long as you leave the door open to correcting yourself once you have access to better evidence.",1338668340

It takes multiple seconds for no apparent reason. There's no high CPU usage and no high I/O usage. It's also very slow to start, and very slow to let me play a game.<p>My theory is it's due to some degree of online activity, that it's gated on my internet bandwidth. Since I only play single-player games, that's a huge annoyance to me, and I often don't start playing games because I know I'll have to sit through Steam startup for several seconds.",1338667506

My question is, is it possible to target 'linux' in general as a single platform at all? I thought heterogeneous nature of linux distros is what would hinder that effort. Something like when you buy certain graphics programs, you get to have only this and that linux variant with this and that software on it in order to run it.",1338667497

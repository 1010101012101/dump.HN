For example, I'd rather pay more after I see that people are actually actively working on it after it becomes open source. In fact, spread out over reasonable milestones I can imagine spending far more.<p>Of course, I'm probably an outlier here.<p>I think your assumption of 1.1 million installs belonging to 10% users is way off. Many people probably never  purchase ST, but still install the Package Manager, especially since ST remains basically usable without paying. I'd think it's closer to 1%.<p>Of course, that still leaves us with quite a lot of money. To be honest, I hadn't looked at the figure of how many installs the package manager had - I'm pretty surprised (and happy) that ST is this popular. Guess I'll have to keep dreaming.",1359460798

5133463,comment,5131486,5133066,2,0,chris_wot,,,"When VMWare was forced into buying the EMC RMSG group, they took on board a whole bunch of disparate software suites they didn't know what to do with.<p>Perhaps some history might help. EMC originally decided that as they were able to buy a lot of other storage companies and make these acquisitions work, they would do the same thing to be known as leaders in the ""enterprise management"" space - all so they could sell more storage.<p>The market apparently was screaming out for a CMDB at the time, so their first acquisition was System Management Arts (SMARTS), which handled event management quite cleverly. Only... it didn't populate the CMDB as well as the market wanted, so EMC then decided to purchase nLayers, which was a network discovery appliance. Then they realised that network discovery alone does not make a CMDB. With this insight, they decided to buy infra, an Australian company that did IT Service Management, with a particular focus around the ITIL framework.<p>Well what do you know, but Infra might do workflows and ticketing, but it doesn't actually control or automate actual configuration management. Thusly, they decided to remedy this by shortly thereafter purchasing Voyence.<p>They actually bought a few more companies, but these were the main four.<p>So at this point, you have at least four separate products, all developed on different architectures with different goals in mind, each of which wasn't talking to each other very well. SMARTS has its own proprietary scripting language and is built on a Java front end, with hooks into Perl. nLayers is a network appliance that runs on some sort of RedHat distribution and is put together with Perl, Apache, tcpdump and an inbuilt Oracle server. infra is a Windows based system that was, when they bought it, only jst running on .NET 2.0 and IIS, with SQL Server and Oracle back ends, with a front end based on (ugh) ActiveX. And Voyence... Well, not rightly sure what Voyence is built on.<p>In other words, totally different development teams, all basically startups that were dynamic and successful in their own right, each having been shoe-horned into a massive hardware company that has no real clue about software or how to develop or support it, and each largely under the radar of the larger EMC.<p>So they decide to write some ""glue"" software to allow all the discovery software to talk to each other. They call this DataCentre Insight (DCI). They have high hopes to do something, allow for mashups and REST based APIs.<p>Well, this doesn't work. There are a lot of disgruntled employees because the RMSG group is so poorly run. A lot of these companies aren't based in Boston (in fact, they are often in different countries), but Boston decides it knows better how to run the companies. As is the way of these things, the clueless managers start strangling the life out of the smaller companies. Eventually, the guy who went on an acquisition spree, he ""leaves"".<p>A new guy comes in. He decides to base the group around Infra, and rebadges all the product names to ""Ionix"" (rumour has it the original name was something else - Urinix - but Joe Tucci looked at in Word, found spell-checker came up with ""urinate"" as a suggestion and promptly nixed it). All brand awareness was dumped, nobody knew what suite was what and it was a marketing <i>disaster</i>.<p>So then DCI was dumped, things kept going downhill, and eventually the new guy, along with <i>another</i> higher up brought in to fix the mess that was Ionix, stitched up a deal to foist the Ionix suite onto VMware. Of course, they keep SMARTS! Probably the best of the bunch because they needed it for certain storage technologies, like ControlCentre.<p>Well, the VMware guys can't have been too impressed, especially given some of thir new offerings were going to overlap (such as with AppSpeed).<p>After this point, no idea what happened. It was basically a big mess, caused by stupidity, cultural arrogance by a massive hardware company where cronyism was rife and innovation struggled. But it was largely caused by EMC management.<p>There are, of course, a lot of other products in the VMware stable, but this should give you some insight into how EMC interferes in VMware. It's a pity, VMWare is a good company!",1359460262

Spot instances are often used for these sorts of batch offline compute-intensive jobs, but if you're a third party you are hostage to the market dynamics (changing prices of spot instances). Since Amazon owns the market, they can just take capacity out of the fleet of available as spot instances instantaneously for free and be immune to pricing changes in the spot-instance market - something no competitor could ever do.<p>So if you were to ask - what is a common batch-style workload that requires a lot of computing power that a lot of people need who would otherwise not be using our spot instances and that can consume our idle capacity? I can't think of a better market than video encoding.<p>This is certainly scary for companies like Zencoder, and feels somewhat anticompetitive (IANAL so speaking practically rather than legally), but it makes otherwise good sense as a business strategy.",1359460105

For some non-profits, of course, this is a non-starter. For others, it can be very natural.

You also structure your corporation so that the people who run it are ""members"" rather than shareholders and any surplus income is always reinvested.

5133364,comment,5133047,5133292,9,0,arnarbi,,,"Both languages are very good. JavaScript has its kinks, but they are not hard to work around with library support or syntax translations (such as CoffeeScript). However, JavaScript's execution model is simple and doesn't provide as much value as the one in Python does, and this is something that is not easily addressed with libraries or (simple) translations.<p>By this I refer to that in Python, most syntactic constructs map to more primitive operations that are accessible (and overridable) in the language itself. For example, anything can be made callable, indexable, sliceable, iterable, etc., by providing the right interface. It is like operator overloading on steroids. Even attribute access (the dot operator) can be overridden in extremely powerful ways. This is great for library writers, who can use it to provide the simplest possible API to their users.<p>I also like very much Python's data model. Things consistently behave as references (even primitive values which all behave as immutable singletons, although of course they are not implemented as such). It just somehow fits and makes sense once you have the model in your mind. JavaScript is slightly less intuitive in this way, and while it makes sense once you understand it, there are a few caveats you need to keep in mind (variable hoisting, scoping, anticipating different context objects). Prototype inheritance works fine but requires a special mind-set, and to me it seems JS fits better for functional programming than object-oriented Java-style.<p>Python's shortcomings are mainly syntactical (not counting the shortcomings of CPython's implementation specifically), such as not having an easy syntax for function expressions. This is the main reason functional programming can get slightly awkward in Python.",1359458273

The many roundrects and shades and gradients created a mess that left a very bad impression.<p>* The underlying engine is very poorly used by ST: just activating vintage mode is enough to tap a lot deeper than the default UI lets you. The engine is great but it only shines when you try to use it <i>as another app</i>. That's weird.<p>Using Vim is a spoiler, I guess.<p>I can't reasonably tell you to not make the switch. I have no idea what knowledge you have of Vim but I can say that I find Vim not only extremelly more powerful than ST but also a lot better designed on almost all fronts.<p>Once the beauty of subsitutions, :global, ranges, Ex commands, text-objects and motions is ingrained in your brain, using ST2 may feel like using (a pretty) TextEdit.

75296,comment,75267,75267,0,0,tjic,,,"We recently launched HeavyInk.com (a mashup of a comic book retailer, collection management, social networking, etc.) competing in a somewhat crowded market of comic book retailers.<p>Before we did this, I did a lot of competitive research.<p>I searched on all the relevant keywords.  I ended up finding a ton of comic book retails, plus a lot of other related sites that had excellent ideas (collection management, social networking, pull list management, etc., etc., etc.).  So: right there, by digging deep into the search results, I found a lot of things that I didn't even know existed, and this let me expand my concept of what we wanted to deliver, and it also let me get a much better handle on what the market is like.<p>After identifying the big names in the space, I went off to Alexa and other sites, and measured the traffic of each of these competitors.<p>I also got some information via backchannels on the likely revenue of 2 or so of the 10 big competitors, and then verified it through another backchannel.  I then did some curve fitting to come up with an algorithm that predicts the revenue of an online comic book store, based on their Alexa rank and traffic.<p>I then went through the top 10 or 20 sites, and took notes.  After I saw the commonalities between them, I created a spreadsheet, and listed all of the salient details of each competitor.<p>At this point I had a good handle on (a) what price point we wanted to aim for during our growth stage; (b) what features we might want to offer.<p>Then I set up a survey on Wufoo (I ran the survey past a survey designer first to get her imprimatur on it), and sent email to the top 10 or 20 comic bloggers.  Two or three of them linked to the survey, and we ended up getting around 500 people to take the survey.<p>I wrote a script that imported the CSV data from Wufoo into our database, and then wrote a bit of Ruby code that did a mediocre version of cluster  analysis.  This let me find out which groups of customers would be most profitable, and in turn let me find out what features these customers would be interested in.<p>Then we wrote up some design documents and started coding.<p>We coded for three months, and went live in a ""quiet beta"" two weeks ago.  We've been hunting bugs, and will announce to our list of 500 or so survey takers on Monday or so.<p>That's how I do market research.<p>--

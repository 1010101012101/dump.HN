It's likely that a lot of the parts included won't be needed by a ""typical"" web application, and if you want to do things another way you'll need to spend some time switching those components out. To be fair though, having ""everything"" can be a big plus, especially when you don't know what you might need (or have the time to glue things together).<p>I don't know how tightly coupled the components are in Revel, but if it's like Django, some things are easy to add/remove (middleware), and others are much harder to work around (ORM, views, etc.).",1368503894

Even the ones with considerable human resources, knowledge, relationships, infrastructure and donor bases usually typically have a need for more support. What these organizations need less of: duplicative efforts that produce fragmentation and are likely to see good ideas die quietly because those trying to do their own thing couldn't obtain the resources to execute.<p>It's sad that so many well-intentioned, idealistic people apparently fail to recognize or refuse to believe that minute for minute and dollar for dollar, their time and money will almost always produce a far greater ROI when invested in existing efforts.",1368503827

5702932,comment,5701436,5702596,10,0,encoderer,,,"It's easy to forget that the American Revolution is what ignited the fire of liberty and republican ethos, and catalyzed all of today's democracies to end or augment monarchial rule.<p>The world in the 18th century was not -- and today still is not -- able to  grow and nurture a powerful country towards ""absolute moral good."" The world is still a primitive and dangerous place full of despots at worst in inequality at best.<p>It's good to hold the US to a higher standard, but unfair IMO to critique with such loathing the way the OP did.<p>Finally: It's certainly true that many of the ideals of the American Revolution were inspired by European writing on the subject. Not surprising considering most colonists in North America then were Europeans themselves. We can never know exactly how the 19th century would've unfolded had the British Empire not been so immature and insecure with themselves. They were a relatively young world power and they seem to have believed in the same age old ""Domino Theory"" that still trips up the US today. Had they been more wise in their choices, they would've granted the colonies freedom from Parliament's authority in exchange for full economic participation in the empire. Most likely you would've seen this unfold over the 19th century and quite possibly maintain itself to this day. Had America been a Sterling country, the British economic situation during WWI & WWII would be so vastly different that it's hard to even speculate. And if that were the case, how would that have changed the pace at which democracy unfolds across the European continent and around the world?<p>I think it's easy and fair and accurate to argue that the spread of democratic and republican ideals was influenced and catalyzed by the 8 years of hot conflict during the American Revolution.

5702886,comment,5702373,5702373,13,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Oh Weston, I'm in your shoes.<p>I'm dreaming for a day when I can start a business that installs high powered vacuum suction motors and large hoses into 20 foot utility box trucks so I can help clean the billions of tons of trash that plague our cities.<p>When I had time I created a hobby of cleaning up small forests and unclaimed land from trash. I'd show up in a green construction vest so people thought I was official and didn't ask questions and would bag all the trash I could find and weighed the bags on a scale. I've got an excel sheet with all my stats. I've picked up over 570 lbs of trash to date. Just in wrappers, McDonalds cups, styrofoam. It's heart breaking to see an area trashy 5 months after I cleaned it up. I stopped doing it because I started wishing death and destruction to the people who littered. It made me angry and bitter towards humanity. I was picking up its trash and it didn't give a damn. I try to ignore it but every time I see trash on the side of the road a part of me keeps saying, ""You should invent something that makes it easier to clean that up, think of how clean the whole world could be"". The little voice keeps saying ""Imagine a giant movable vaccum cleaner mounted on a truck with large hoses sticking out. It could work. Just try."". I can't stop thinking about it.<p>Your story has actually inspired me to try to go ahead and pursue that dream. If it's one thing tax payers are willing to pay for it's less trash in their neighborhood.<p>Anyone interested shoot me an email chris at norcophoenix dot com. I know an electrician, a guy who knows where to order the trucks from, and some really cheap office space for startups. I'm in St. Louis Missouri btw.",1368502317

5702868,comment,5701579,5702616,6,0,deno,,,"> For the past couple of years, I really have been wishing for an ""XMPP, but built on JSON, not XML"". Really. I want this.<p>The X in XMPP stands for <i>extensible</i> not XML. The reason XML fits the bill is because it has concept of namespaces, what JSON has? If you don’t have explicit namespace support how do you make your JSON variant of XMPP forward‐compatible? You don’t without making it look much, much, worse than any of the examples I’m about to show below.<p>> (…) I really do prefer JSON over XML because of how compact and readable it is.<p>> XML is big, bloated, and bureaucratic.<p>My standard response to this is always “show me a JSON fragment that is shorter or prettier looking than an equivalent XML fragment.”<p>XML can certainly be shorter than JSON and often is, and repeated tags are the best showcase for it:<p><pre><code>    <user id=""abc"">\n       <phoneNo type=""home"">123456789</phoneNo>\n       <phoneNo type=""work"">321654987</phoneNo>\n    </user>\n</code></pre>\nThis turns into this beautiful JSON:<p><pre><code>    [\n      ""users"": [\n\t{\n\t  ""id"": ""abc"",\n\t  ""phoneNos"": [\n\t    { ""type"": ""home"", ""value"": ""123456789"" }, \n\t    { ""type"": ""work"", ""value"": ""321654987"" }\n\t  ]\n\t}\n      ]\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nOh, but what if order is important? Take this example:<p><pre><code>    <policy id=""123"">\n        <drop someFilter=""ghi"" />\n        <accept someFilter=""abc"" anotherFilter=""xyz"">\n            <comment>\n               This comment is quite long and spans several\n               lines of text in pretty printed XML. \n               But this is quite alright, because XML\n               by default strips extra whitespace.\n            </comment>\n            <!-- That’s another kind of comment, but this one is not meant\n                 to be part of the data, unlike the one above. \n                 Some would say something as basic as comments is\n                 an essential part of so called human‐readable format… --> \n        </accept>\n        <drop someFilter=""foo"" anotherFilter=""bar"">\n            <reason statusCode=""690"">No reason</reason>\n        </drop>\n    </policy>\n</code></pre>\nNow you have to do it like that:<p><pre><code>    [\n      ""policies"": [\n\t{\n\t  ""id"": ""123"",\n\t  ""rules"": [\n\t    { ""type"": ""drop"", ""someFilter"": ""ghi"" },\n\t    { \n\t      ""type"": ""accept"",\n\t      ""someFilter"": ""abc"",\n\t      ""anotherFilter"": ""xyz"",\n\t      ""comment"": ""Unfortunately the best you can do with JSON is to rely on your editor’s dynamic wrapping. And this is how you break the line: \\nWhat a treat!"",\n\t    }, \n\t    { ""type"": ""drop"", ""someFilter"": ""foo"", ""anotherFilter"": ""bar"", \n\t      ""reason"": { ""statusCode"": 690, ""message"": ""No reason""}\n\t    }\n\t  ]\n\t}\n      ]\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nFor an example of how horrible JSON in wild can really be see Reddit’s JSON API. Because JSON has no syntax for metadata you get things like that:<p><pre><code>    [ \n      {\n        ""kind"": ""thing-foo"",\n        ""items"": [\n           # \n           # list of comments or something that goes on for\n           # two screens\n           #\n        ],\n        ""votes"": 15\n      }\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nSee the keys are sorted for convenience.<p>XML’s text representation is very minimal and consistent. You don’t need to quote Every Single Thing, and there are no special cases for not quoting just some type of values. The only redundant part of XML is repeating the name of the closing tag if the </element> has value. But this actually aids readability, as demonstrated above.<p>Editing complex JSON by hand with a regular text editor is a nightmare, because of all those single '}', ']' and commas trailing for several lines when there’s any light nesting involved. Editing XML by hand on the other hand is no big deal.",1368501854

""The kernel is just a library"" means that all of the experience we have designing and factoring userspace APIs carries over into kernel design.  Furthermore it means that the kernel is a strictly less flexible library than userspace libraries, with a strictly more expensive calling convention, and that its <i>only</i> advantage is that it can protect and mediate access to hardware.<p>> There are good reasons why they have not caught on, performance being the most salient one.<p>Most of the received wisdom about microkernels is based on outdated designs like Mach, and not modern designs like L4.  L4 is significantly more efficient than Mach.",1368501124

Here is Dennis Ritchie:\n</code></pre>\n""From the point of view of the group that was to be most involved in the beginnings of Unix (K. Thompson, Ritchie, M. D. McIlroy, J. F. Ossanna), the decline and fall of Multics had a directly felt effect. We were among the last Bell Laboratories holdouts actually working on Multics, so we still felt some sort of stake in its success. More important, the convenient interactive computing service that Multics had promised to the entire community was in fact available to our limited group, at first under the CTSS system used to develop Multics, and later under Multics itself. Even though Multics could not then support many users, it could support us, albeit at exorbitant cost. We didn't want to lose the pleasant niche we occupied, because no similar ones were available; even the time-sharing service that would later be offered under GE's operating system did not exist. What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.

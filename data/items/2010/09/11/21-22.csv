1682433,comment,1681721,1682274,0,0,randallsquared,,,"If they're annoyed enough, they can find something you did do, and charge you for it.  Depending on how visibly you live your life, this might be easy or difficult, but ultimately they can just ""remember"" something you said that you didn't say, and then you could go to jail.  All this is chancy, since the jury, should it come to that, may be sympathetic to you, but if you're habitually confrontational, that might be less likely.  Basically, the Martha Stewart conviction destroyed what remained of my faith in the ""justice"" system.  Here was a woman who, in theory, had the deck stacked her way... money, fame, etc.  What was she convicted of?  Lying to a federal officer, not under oath, about not committing a crime that they couldn't convict her of in the first place.  The conclusive evidence basically boiled down to one or more officers' word that she denied wrongdoing.<p>Let me recap:  if some police are determined to put you in jail, you can go to jail for lying to an officer, when you assert that you didn't commit a crime.  They do not have to prove that you did commit the crime.  Just saying you didn't do it is presumptively a lie, and a federal crime.  If you give them reason to be mad at you, you're gambling with your freedom, no matter what you have or haven't done.<p>Note that not talking to the police is not sufficient to save you from prosecution, since the vast majority could be considered guilty of misprision of felony -- <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00000004----000-.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00000004----...</a> -- which is itself a federal felony, so if someone tells you they saw a felony committed (possession, say) and you know they didn't report it, now <i>you're</i> committing a felony unless you report <i>them</i>.",1284241831

1682422,comment,1682125,1682125,0,0,chmike,,,"In the university I studied, students organized different games played trough the year. It is a good method to help people socialize and know each other in the first year.<p>One of these game was called hitman. Every student who wanted to play had to provide a picture of himself and was registered as player. Then each player was given a random photo of another player and a small trumpet in paper that rolls out when we blow in it. So evry player was a hitman and a target of another hitman at the same time.<p>The hitman had to ""kill"" the person on the photo that was given to him. Killing was done by blowing the trumpet and touching the person with the rolled out paper.<p>Of course it was forbidden to kill anybody during lessons. The task was made more difficult by allowing someone to be immune to killing by holding an open umbrella above his head.<p>The hitman had thus to first locate its target, spy him without beeing recognized as his hitman and find the best moment to kill the target. Witnesses must be present to attest a valid killing. The last target to survive was the winner.<p>I didn't play the game so I don't know the details, but it was very funny to see these students walking around with open umbrellas, even inside buildings, and all the trumpet noise. It was also funny people talking to each other trying to figure out who is ones hitman. There was enough players to make it very hard to know, even at the end of the game<p>This is an exemple of game that was socialy usefull and fun. Organizing, providing the equipment and managing the game could be a business. Sell it in a box, one box per player. The umbrellas might be a bit dangerous for the eyes, so funny big umbrellas without metal in it, just for the game use, could be better and even more fun as well as justify the rent fee.",1284241488

What the murderer's lawyer wanted was to have the confession deemed inadmissible (and hence a new trial, which was unlikely to result in a different verdict due to the overwhelming other evidence but would at least line the lawyer's pockets a bit more) on the grounds that sitting there and not answering questions for a couple of hours should oblige the police to stop asking questions.",1284241316

I think the very precise engineering they put into making a great product, then the massive user adoption that follows, is what allows for other websites to use similar technologies with confidence.  In other words, the fact that Google implements something gives that implementation both massive social proof, and user familiarity.<p>Granted, it's not <i>all</i> about engineering and a huge user base.  If you replaced the word ""marketing"" with ""buzz,"" I would tend to agree with you.  If there's one thing that's become apparent to me recently, it's that nearly <i>any</i> idea, product, person, place, tv show, etc, can be validated by generating a shitstorm of buzz about it.  I suspect there's some reptilian instinct that changes the way we view things if we see others accepting it, and media attention, though often a misrepresentation, does the trick.

My PTH and calcium levels were high all along, but they ruled out hyperparathyroidism because the radioactive and ultrasound scans they did failed to show the inflamed gland.<p>It turns out the scans can be very hit and miss.  The parathyroid glands are very small and the reliability of the scans depends largely on the experience of the person carrying them out.  Hyperparathyroidism is the only known condition to cause increased PTH levels. If both serum PTH and calcium are high then it's almost certain to be hyperparathyroidism.  A simple test for PTH levels can confirm or rule out the diagnosis.<p>As for treatment, here in the UK, most hospitals still perform the 'old' style surgery (open parathyroidectomy) which is risky and has a long recovery time. I'm saving for an operation at a hospital abroad which performs a minimally invasive procedure - much safer and quicker.<p>Good luck and keep us posted.",1284239549

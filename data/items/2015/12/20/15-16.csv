This cone generally overlaps the spectral region covered by the cones sensitive to red and green. The exact area of overlap determines whether or not each woman sees &quot;more&quot;: If the fourth cone completely overlaps the region covered by an existing cone, no new information is presented to the visual system and the input is effectively discarded (she sees &quot;just as much&quot; red or green, not more, not less). If, however, the fourth cone has peak sensitivity in the gap between the cones covering red and green, she will she up to 100% more colour than women with normal vision.",1450627101

The point is that for a <i>given volume</i> or rate of new comments, the moderation burden of a comment is the same regardless of the age of its parent -- provided, again, that the moderator&#x27;s method for finding out about the next new comment is O(1).<p>Note that I&#x27;m not claiming that old comment sections should always stay open forever, just that great grandparent is not on its own a good argument for closing them.<p>So here is a second argument: maybe the site&#x27;s moderation process relies on flagging by ordinary users, and maybe the modal ordinary user cannot be coaxed into using any method for finding out about new comments except for scanning individual comment sections.<p>I jumped into this conversation because I suspect that it is worthwhile to try to keep comment sections open as long as practical, so if I were in charge of a discussion site where the assumptions of the second argument were valid, I&#x27;d try to avoid the conclusion: for example, I might give users a way to subscribe or express an interest in getting a notification (by, e.g., email) whenever a new comment appears in a particular comment section; then I&#x27;d keep a section open for new comments as long as it has subscribers; and then I&#x27;d wait to see whether the subscribers flag enough of the new spam in the section to keep rate of spam in the section to an acceptable level.",1450625886

It&#x27;s just a rule of thumb</i><p>YES<p><i>Feel free to use it for ordering possible explanations by complexity</i><p>YES<p><i>but don&#x27;t mistake it for a scientific tool, because it isn&#x27;t.</i><p>Wrong.  As was stated by colordrops above, it&#x27;s a heuristic technique.  As you said, it&#x27;s useful for ordering levels of complexity.  Where you and he <i>may</i> disagree with me is that such a tool is an excellent tool for pursuing investigations.<p>This is where my choice of the word &quot;profitable&quot; comes into play.  Someone is figuring out some mystery and has hypotheses X and Y.  For Occam&#x27;s Razor to apply, X and Y have to have equal predictive performance, but Y is more grandiose.  As such, X is more likely, per Occam&#x27;s Razor.  Pursuing X will either result in X being proven correct (at least until new contradictory information arises later), or quickly pivoting to Y (or in the worst-case scenario, new hypothesis Z).  This course of action results in the least amount of time and resources wasted.  It is by definition more profitable.  You could choose to investigate Y first, but being more grandiose, it will be much more difficult to test Y.  If Y turns out to be wrong, you will have wasted much more time and resources.  If someone chooses Y first, it&#x27;s because X and Y are NOT equal, and Occam&#x27;s Razor then would not be relevant.<p>This guy gives a much better explanation of Occam&#x27;s Razor than I ever could:  <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Occams-Razor-true"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Occams-Razor-true</a><p><i>Most changes in accepted theories are not because Occam&#x27;s razor picked them - but because data falsified the preceding theory that Occam&#x27;s razor picked for a newer one - turning the old one into merely a useful model - and eliminating it from discussion (falsified).</i><p>Seriously, why would anyone jump to investigate a more complicated hypothesis when there&#x27;s a simpler hypothesis to investigate, and both hypotheses have equal explanation performance and supporting evidence?  It is far less expensive to investigate the simpler hypothesis first.  It certainly is not acceptable to be dismissive of the simpler hypothesis.<p>At the time of my original comment, there was almost no information in the thread.  There certainly was zero information in the OP article.  Given multiple possible explanations, I could not see any reason why the article jumped to the foreign nation state explanation.  Imagine what that would have involved:<p>- hacking their engineering team to remotely modify the code<p>- infiltrating their engineering team with a mole to modify the code<p>Both of these are big conspiracy theories.  With no additional information, what is more likely?  That or:<p>- crap, that guy that left the company in a huff really hated us and had to screw us one last time<p>- whoops, our engineering team accidentally screwed up bad<p>Since when is jumping to conspiracy theories without good reasons an acceptable pattern of logic?<p>edit:  formatting",1450624639

10767217,comment,10763274,10766264,0,0,to3m,,,"The basic operation for accessing a value from a structure is to take the address of the structure, add a compile-time constant offset to it, and use that address. There&#x27;s an addressing mode specifically for this in the Z80: you put the struct address in a register, and have the constant offset as part of the instruction. So you can do stuff like this: (numbers in comments are: <bytes for this instruction> <bytes total> / <cycles for this instruction> <cycles total>)<p><pre><code>    <<put address in IX>>\n    LD A,(IX+0)            ; A=SELF.X              3 3  / 19 19\n    ADD A,(IX+2)           ; A=SELF.X+SELF.DX      3 6  / 19 38\n    LD (IX+0),A            ; SELF.X=SELF.X+SELF.DX 3 9  / 19 57\n    XOR A                  ; A=0                   1 10 / 4  61\n    LD (IX+2),A            ; SELF.DX=0             3 13 / 19 80\n</code></pre>\nThe 6502 doesn&#x27;t have anything exactly like this. You do have an indirect addressing mode, but the offset goes in a register. So for every access, you need to have the offset into the index register. (There&#x27;s no point adding the offset to the address; the offset is mandatory, so you&#x27;d then just have to load zero into the index register every time.) So the above in 6502:<p><pre><code>    <<put address in $70>>\n    LDY #2                                         2 2  / 2 2\n    LDA ($70),Y            ; A=SELF.DX             2 4  / 5 7\n    LDY #0                                         2 6  / 2 9\n    CLC                                            1 7  / 2 11\n    ADC ($70),Y            ; A=SELF.DX+SELF.X      2 9  / 5 16\n    STA ($70),Y            ; SELF.X=SELF.X+SELF.DX 2 11 / 6 22\n    TYA                                            1 12 / 2 24\n    LDY #2                                         2 14 / 2 26\n    STA ($70),Y            ; SELF.DX=0             2 16 / 6 32\n</code></pre>\nWhich is rather unwieldy, takes up more space, and is a bit slow (the 4:1 ratio I mentioned in my original past is here closer to 2:1) - even after I rearranged the code a bit so the Y value didn&#x27;t need reloading so much. You also have the issue that the struct address is a 16-bit quantity, something that is inconvenient to handle on the 6502. There are no instructions that operate on 16-bit data.<p>One thing the 6502 does have though is an addressing mode where the operand&#x27;s address is a fixed 16-bit value (from the instruction) plus an 8-bit index register. So, with this in mind, what you could do is have a separate table for each struct field. So this switches things around, and instead of a runtime 16-bit address (of the struct) and a compile-time 8-bit offset (of the field), you have a compile-time 16-bit address (of the field table) and a runtime 8-bit offset (for the row in the table). Which is a perfect fit. Best of all, the indexing is free if you arrange things correctly, which is not that hard to do. Then the code would look more like this:<p><pre><code>    <<put row in X>>\n    CLC                     ;                        1 1  / 2 2\n    LDA XS,X                ; A = SELF.X             3 4  / 4 6\n    ADC DXS,X               ; A = SELF.X+SELF.DX     3 7  / 4 10\n    STA XS,X                ; SELF.X=SELF.X+SELF.DX  3 10 / 4 14\n    LDA #0                  ;                        2 12 / 2 16\n    STA DXS,X               ; SELF.DX=0              3 15 / 4 20\n</code></pre>\nAnd there&#x27;s that 4:1 ratio again...<p>Each object&#x27;s &quot;address&quot; is now an 8-bit quantity (it&#x27;s just an index into the tables), so much easier to deal with. And moving from one object to the next is very quick, since it&#x27;s just incrementing a register.<p>There doesn&#x27;t appear to be anything analogous to this alternative approach on the Z80.",1450624405

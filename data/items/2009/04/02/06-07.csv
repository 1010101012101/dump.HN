I sometimes write pipeline tasks in Ruby or Perl.  i.e. while line = STDIN.gets; puts transform(line); end.  Typical disk bandwidth is 2MB/s in Ruby, and 25-120MB/s in Perl, Java, Awk, or C.<p>Beyond that, a lot of the metaprogramming features that make Ruby cool are also expensive when done repetitively.<p>Also, Ruby's threads REALLY suck.  And it has impossible to track down memory leaks in the interpreter.  Ask mojombo about fun with those.",1238655363

543010,comment,542173,542609,0,0,danbmil99,,,"yes, that's exactly what he's saying.  The dirty secret is that the variation in employee 'worth' to a company varies much more than a tight range of salaries based on statistical averages.  It's not just talent; some employees become inordinately important due to their knowledge and acquired experience in a narrow area.  Losing them might mean shipping a product 6 months late, which could be fatal.<p>Of course there's a potential here for employee blackmail, but hey, live by the market, die by it.  It's a constant struggle to be 'fair' yet maximize your return on investment.  These two goals don't automatically align.",1238655310

For example, you can do it to find the distance from a point to a plane (|ax0+by0+cz0+d|/sqrt(a^2+b^2+c^2)).  The math behind it is pretty much the same, except you're projecting onto a normal instead of onto the line itself.",1238654039

And if you put some experienced Scala people up against similarly skilled Ruby folk in a ""code race,"" I'd expect it to be a pretty fair match.  This is not Java we're talking about, Scala can be extremely powerful in the hands of someone that knows what they're doing, and I imagine the Twitter guys have enough of those people that they'll do just fine.",1238653637

The company and the government agency are pretty rational. But it just tells us even we are rational, the complexity of the world is much more unpredictable.<p>Companies and governments should be amoral but rational. otherwise church and state will not be able to separated from each other. To me, moralistic companies/governments do more harm than welfare to humanity.",1253969986

Back in College, I had this program that allowed me to snag released tickets to our basketball team (it was first come first served after release) for lots of friends. I went out and windows updated -- on the biggest game of the year.",1253969861
845397,comment,843587,845343,0,0,markdennehy,,,"I've spent a few years dealing with fuzzy requirement myself. And we tell outselves it hurts noone when a bug happens, but we're being deliberately obtuse in those cases I think. Does it really hurt noone if an online test which comprises a percentage of someones final degree grade, crashes repeatedly while the course tries to take the test? Does it really hurt noone if bad UIs cause people to lose time or money, especially when you add up all that time?<p>I'm not suffering from an absolutist morality here - I'm pointing out that there are <i>consequences</i> to piss-poor engineering, and it is <i>necessary</i> for engineers to take the viewpoint of those being hurt rather than that of those trying to make money selling the product; because after four hundred years of training engineers, that's the best way we've found of preventing disasters. And the same should be true of developers, because just as civil and mechanical engineering before it, computer and software engineering are increasingly forming an integral part of the infrastructure we live our lives in.",1253969780

You scan your groceries with a handheld unit as you put them in the bags in your cart. All you do at (self) check out is pay.<p>Vast amount of time saved by not unloading the cart and reloading your bags.<p>I don't understand how theft isn't a problem since it is easy to even inadvertently forget to scan something as you put it in the cart, but it is a huge improvement in the shopping experience.",1253969751

That's a strong point in favor of the model IMO, but as I said this is a complex, subtle field in which I'm not an expert. Imagine how badly the popular media gets computer stories and think that we're making at least as bad a hash out of this whole field.",1253969470

The comment about adapting to your mood is in reference to how much weight we should give to your prior play history versus your current playing song. It sounds like you like the emphasis on the current song but want it to stay in the same genre until changed.",1253969246
845391,comment,845353,845353,0,0,markdennehy,,,"I wrote ""the ford pinto memo"", not ""the ford pinto"".<p>The point wasn't whether the car was okay, it was about the amoral behaviour of the company. Ford crossed a line between wanting to produce something to a given spec; and depraved indifference to the damage the errors in the design would cause. It only sounds like a subtle difference.",1253969167
845390,comment,845097,845373,0,0,blazzerbg,,,"the issue with almost every other than Windows OS is that there are limited community support. Most of the *X OS has good and straight support but only on certain places, MS may be has the most grasping marketing strategy - make people talk about his products everywhere and value them. This is valid not only for OS but for every product especially for programming languages and tools.....
Everybody can try to search issue on Mac/Unix/Linux and for Windows #.... Statistic is not result from fact that there are less issues on OS but talks how much people are familiar and actually using one OS.",1253969153

I strongly advocate for the freedoms it defends and also for the ""giving back"" attitude it obliges. Free Software, by its very definition, stays free. There are no such warranties in he rest of the open-source space. OS is useful, but I don't think it's enough.",1253968645

845380,comment,844105,845350,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""some of the teams rejected the terms that they were given in the past.""<p>If some startup founders rejected 50,000 Euros and great advisers, for a 5-10% share , there is something broken in the model. At least from the pov of the (vetted, chosen) people doing the rejecting if 50,000 Euros is not providing enough value they ae well within their rights to reject it.<p>Fixing the broken parts may pay off more than making arbitrary rules that people have to accept whoever puts up 50k Euros. This is like saying people have to accept jobs because ""we put so much effort into interviewing you"". Such rules are probably unenforceable anyway and make the proposers look like idiots.",1253968229

Here goes.<p>I would  (a) (pay decent money to get a brilliant designer to) design a new model  with a powerful hardware base(nice camera, graphics card) (b)<i>radically</i> clean up the software platform, paying attention to well designed graphics apis and controllers (c)give away an upgrade to the new platform to anyone who turns in an old model and then start working on the next hardware AND sw  in ONE package device.   (d) Build an appstore that caters to apps  <i>only</i> for this new model (Have a better approval process than Apple, shouldn't be very hard to do!).<p>Plan to release ONE model every two or three years or so. Pay more attention to the Indian and Chinese markets (they sell <i>many</i> more  phones than the American market - most plans are not tied to a device and people are used to buying undiscounted phones).<p>This instantly creates a mass of customers standardised on a single platform with identical device capabilities (this is the biggest advantage of the IPhone, there are at most one or two device/sw combinations to program for. the RIM hardware/sw combos are all over the place and the graphics suck badly).<p>yeah ok that probably makes no financial sense. But that's what I'd consider doing if I were an executive at RIM (which is probably a good reason I am <i>not</i> a high paid manager :-P).<p>RiM <i>can</i> dominate the ""business mobile"" marketplace if they play their cards right.",1253967088

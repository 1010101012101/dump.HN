For example, you can easily run isc-dhcpd on each ToR, instead of DHCP relaying back to one mega DHCP server.  Distributing services like this scales better, and reduces the blast radius of service failure.<p>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with the idea of a transparent caching TFTP proxy server running on the top of rack switch, to make PXE scale better to large clusters.<p>The important thing is that anyone who has the know-how to write a transparent caching TFTP proxy server for Linux can just go ahead and do that on a Cumulus Linux switch!  You don&#x27;t need to come to us and convince us that it is a good idea and then wait for us to actually implement it.  Compare that to asking for features from a traditional switch vendor...<p>- nolan

They have the cash and I don&#x27;t see why they would be in any rush, if driverless cars are expected on the streets in 2020, or potentially 2023..<p>As a matter of fact, Apple&#x27;s last quarterly profit was $18bn, while Tesla&#x27;s valuation, is $25bn. They could buy a company like Tesla every two quarters..<p>Furthermore, maybe what they are trying to do is to create some in-house talent, in preparation for future purchases. Perhaps so that they can have their own employees join those of the acquired company..",1423890441

9048826,comment,9048110,9048110,0,0,Sanddancer,,,"I&#x27;m wondering how much testing Nest did with the photoelectrics in the smoke detector. A teardown [1] seems to show a rather simple design for the led and photodiode beam path, as well as both of those components having places for light to potentially leak in around the diode bases. Other detectors [2], [3], seem to have much more complicated beam paths, with baffles and such, as well as better shielding to ensure the sensitive components are well-protected. Given this, I can see how all the differences in tolerances can lead to gaps which lead to lots of false alarms.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nest+Protect+Teardown/20057"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nest+Protect+Teardown/20057</a>

I think they are arguing that a flatter gradient in the improvement of computers would encourage the diffusion of comparable levels of computing power (the poor). And that if computers didn&#x27;t become obsolete so quickly, we wouldn&#x27;t be buying and throwing them away every year.<p>Early on the computation curve this was true, computers had 20k to 64k for a couple decades. Remember the 386 to 486 upgrade adapters in the 90s. We no longer have that upgradability.<p>&quot;invalid in each word&quot; is a bit rude.",1423890237

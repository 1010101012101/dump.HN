308371,comment,307722,308345,0,0,briansmith,,,"1. That is typically the case with parser generators. But, it is still a build-time dependency. Right now I don't really have any build-time processing except for unit tests and I want to keep ""building"" as simple as possible.<p>2. That is good to know. That indicates to me that PLY doesn't do a lot of optimizations, but maybe the optimizations that I am used to having for LL(k) parsing are not effective or necessary for (LA)LR parsing.<p>4. That indicates to me that the performance won't be any better than the re-only approach. What isn't shown is that I compile the ""iri"" and ""iri-reference"" regexes into two big regular expressions. AFAICT, matching one match for a big regular expression instead of a series of matches of small regular expressions will always be faster, especially if the RE engine does any (global) optimizations.<p>By the way, an IRI is a single token in my application so my parser is really just a lexer.",1221759986

If we have overestimated the availability of finite resources, that is true. But just saying so isn't enough -- to be taken seriously, you should rephrase your belief as something like ""As my long energy, long basic materials, and short consumer discretionaries portfolio demonstrates, I believe that higher prices for energy and basic materials, coupled with lower average wages, will reduce the standard of living and thus reduce consumption of non-essential goods."" And there's a catch-22, here: if you and all the other people who talk that way are also investing that way, energy and basic materials prices will rise, to the point that balance is restored.",1221757948

7008846,comment,7007828,7008178,21,0,tombrossman,,,"TL/DR: Have Amazon handle this for you, they are awesome at customer service.<p>I had a one year old HTC Desire which malfunctioned under warranty (Europe here = 2yrs mandatory) and sought to return it to them for repair. They were a huge pain in the ass, refusing to pay shipping to the repair depot despite this being explicitly covered, and so I asked Amazon (from whom I bought it) for assistance dealing with HTC. Totally shocked when Amazon told me &#x27;No problem, here&#x27;s a free shipping label, send it back to us for a full refund. The price was hundreds of pounds less by then and they refunded the original price. It was in pretty good shape but not at all in &#x27;like new&#x27; condition. I immediately bought another from them and kept the difference - they weren&#x27;t interested in just exchanging it.<p>Fast forward to now, and it&#x27;s pretty much the same deal with LG and a defective Nexus 4. LG agreed in writing to reimburse shipping prior to me sending it, but now want to change the terms & added an NDA and are illegally withholding payment[1] of their debt. I contacted Amazon again and they told me the same deal: &#x27;Send it in for a full refund any time, no problem&#x27;.<p>Needless to say, I now buy all electronics on Amazon. This is probably their goal and we&#x27;re both okay with it. As for HTC and LG, at least in the UK, they are bastards and I&#x27;ll keep hoping for better support from other manufacturers when I can.<p>[<a href""https://twitter.com/tombrossman/status/41800309005944832"" rel""nofollo"">https://twitter.com/tombrossman/status/418003090059448322</a>]",1388789767

7008826,comment,7008325,7008707,3,0,tolmasky,,,"At the time Google turned this down it was still completely unclear how they would make any money at all. The thinking at the time was that search was a more or less solved problem that had zero profitable potential (hence Yahoo becoming a &quot;media&quot; company). Only now, years later, does a company that sells ads on search results and makes cars that drive themselves on the side seem like a &quot;logical&quot; outcome.<p><i>This</i> is the problem with trying to focus on working on the &quot;important&quot; things instead of the things that interest you: its incredibly difficult to know what will be important ahead of time. Who would have guessed that a strange abstract math that only dealt in 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s, originally invented in the <i>1800&#x27;s</i> would later be essential to powering every machine in the 2000s? At the time you could have rightly criticized Boole for having the luxury and privilege to focus on something so <i>useless</i> instead of using his time in medicine for example. Someone arguing that Boolean algebra would actually be instrumental 100 years later in machines that can cure diseases would have seemed like an absurd counter-argument.<p>When Apple was started the big computer companies laughed at the notion of a personal computer in every home. Steve Jobs&#x27; dream of everyone owning a personal computer is arguably one of arrogance and privilege: why focus on that in the 80s when there were so many &quot;real&quot; problems to work on?<p>Twitter is the epitome of silly privilege ideas: a company based around people yelling short sentences into the ether. Who would have guessed that would empower real time delivery of current events like a hurricane or a tidal wave?<p>No one knows <i>what</i> will be <i>the</i> idea that revolutionizes the future, but a lot of people <i>do</i> know what they&#x27;re passionate about. If you focus on something you think is important but you&#x27;re not passionate about, the result probably won&#x27;t be great. If instead everyone focuses on what they&#x27;re passionate about, we&#x27;ll have a lot of top notch incarnations of an incredibly diverse set of ideas. Tons will be duds, but a few <i>will</i> change things, and they probably won&#x27;t be the ones you predicted.<p>So why not accept that some people are interested in different things than you instead of trying to determine whether the owner of Snapchat is focusing on the right thing or not.

7008742,comment,7007945,7008505,7,0,rickhanlonii,,,"I was confused by this for awhile until I started hanging around a group of people who use SnapChat almost as much as texting. For the most part they share innocuous &quot;here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing&quot; type photos. They use SnapChat because it&#x27;s a really easy to send a photo to everyone on their list at the same time individually when they want to share a photo of what they&#x27;re doing at that moment, with no feed or wall or comments to maintain later.<p>Thus, they really don&#x27;t care if the photos are saved anywhere because they&#x27;re not concerned with the privacy of their photos--at worst the snaps they share are unflattering. Their main concern is that they don&#x27;t want to maintain any photos later, they just want to tell each other &#x27;hi, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing&#x27; and forget about it.<p>In other words, to them SnapChat isn&#x27;t a platform to share photos <i>secretly</i>, it&#x27;s a platform to share photos <i>momentarily</i>. SnapChat even sells it as this:<p>>The images might be a little grainy, and you may not look your best, but that&#x27;s the point. It&#x27;s about the moment, a connection between friends in the present, and not just a pretty picture.<p>I get it now. I still don&#x27;t like SnapChat at all (the UI is ugly, the UX is par, and I don&#x27;t like the attitude of the company), but I see the user appeal and I see why the users SnapChat wants most will continue to use the app even though one of their friends may be keeping that picture they took of their thanksgiving turkey permanently.",1388788841

The problem here is that the transition was not, in my opinion, handled intelligently.<p>What I mean by this is that in five years there are a number of things that could have been introduced incrementally and with minor impact to existing libraries.  For example, making range() behave like xrange() seems trivial from a user&#x27;s point of view.  The same with print vs. print().<p>Yes, some of the other important differences would require breaking code in more serious ways.  This, too, over five years, could have been introduced with incremental transition tools that would make the upgrading of existing libraries as automatic as possible.<p>If a language doesn&#x27;t have massive and useful libraries you can play with it and break it.  Nobody will care and adoption will be swift.  That&#x27;s not the case with Python.  Aside from language benefits I&#x27;d say the main differentiating reason for which Python is really valuable is that there are libraries out there to do just about anything you want.  Breaking (or un-breaking, depending on your perspective) the language breaks the libraries, therefore, no matter how wonderful the language might be it is a non-starter.<p>The transition from one version to the next has to be automatic.  Nobody has the clock cycles to engage in months&#x27; long research projects to comb through code and fix things.  No, tools like 2to3 are not what I am talking about.<p>One non-coding example I can offer is what happens when you open an old Solidworks file with a newer version of Solidworks.  The program immediately fires-up a format converter and tells you it is converting to the new file format.  Once done, you save and you are done.  All you have to do is open the file and re-save it.  That&#x27;s how it should be.  Surely in this day and age there&#x27;s enough CS intelligence out there to make a fully automatic version-to-version converter.  Now that would be something.  It would certainly bring the Python community forward in unimaginable ways.<p>I&#x27;ll go further and suggest that this could actually be an idea that could set Python apart:  No new version is released without a matching fully-automatic old-to-new converter.<p>Hey, ideas are easy.",1388788458

The incident strained relations between the United States and Japan, and resulted in the arrest and prosecution of two senior executives, as well as the imposition of sanctions on the company by both countries.[6] Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania said &quot;What Toshiba and Kongsberg did was ransom the security of the United States for $517 million.&quot;<p><a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba#1939_to_200"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba#1939_to_2000</a>",1388788187

This seems reasonable to me:<p>Neutrality rules are repealed. Some ISPs begin discriminating against certain publishers that do not pay up, but can use the payments to subsidize reductions in cost of consumer access. The &quot;multitudes&quot; of neutrality proponents begin demanding undiscriminated connections, calling for boycotts, switching to providers that offer such connections. Neutrality activists develop tools to compare and publicize connection rates to different publishers through different ISPs. Small-time providers form associations to raise awareness of the issue as well. Ethical marketing comes into play as some ISPs and some big publishers reject connection rate differentiation. Some ISPs that also own publishing properties are caught or implied to be preferring their own content over competitors, drawing political attention. In some areas, net neutrality laws (not just &quot;rules&quot;) are passed, which is a draw for startups. Meanwhile, many who had no home connectivity in the past are now able to afford the &quot;subsidized/sponsored&quot; service level.<p>What irks me about the middle-class idealogues raising a fuss about this now is that they arbitrarily draw the line of equality around big corporations, with little attention given to the fact that service is tiered at all. If it doesn&#x27;t make sense for small publishers to be penalized for not ponying up, it should make even less sense for certain individuals in society to be penalized for not being able to afford anything more than dial-up or basic DSL. Going further, it should be more appalling that the most financially under-resourced can&#x27;t even afford the most basic service level, and live without any internet participation. Instead, they prefer corporations to carry the costs of keeping the level field artificially level, while doing nothing to help those below them have the same level of access they do.",1388787299

The course is called &quot;Programming languages and compilers&quot; and its goal is to teach students about compilers by making them write one.<p>As I have never ventured into the world of compilers, I&#x27;m a bit lost as to where to start. I&#x27;m familiar with C, Python, HTML, Mathematica, FORTRAN 77, all of which I&#x27;ve used at different times and for different purposes, but haven&#x27;t mastered any of them.<p>We (teams of 2) have the choice of either adding functionality to an existing compiler (suggestions include Gambit-C, Pascal-S, Tiny C, Small C) or write our own for any language or a subset thereof. If we choose to write our own compiler, it has to be written in Scheme, unless it can compile itself, in which case we can write it in any language. Coincidentally, I have begun reading Practical Common Lisp [0] last month and enjoy it.<p>The suggested textbook is &quot;A. Appel, Modern compiler implementation in Java/ML/C&quot;. Other suggested readings are by Paul Graham.<p>Now my questions are:<p>1) Should I write my own compiler or extend an existing one?<p>2) Should I write a self-compiling compiler?<p>3) What language should I try to compile?<p>4) What books/resources will be helpful?<p>I&#x27;m asking these questions because I want to get the most out of this class.

In general I agree with GP.<p>Fact:\nThe Fed has injected large amounts of cash into the asset markets using <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easin"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing</a> .  I&#x27;ve never added up the cash as a percentage of GDP or one of the Ms, but it always seemed significant (i.e. 5-10% of GDP, but this is debatable).  I should caveat by saying that this cash never entered general circulation, which has meant treating it as part of the monetary supply is tricky.<p>Now, based on this fact of Fed intervention there are a few opinions:<p>1. While the Fed directly isn&#x27;t buying equities (i.e. stocks, but this is as far as we know), its presence means that all the other cash holders have to seek out other investments to get inflation-beating rates of returns.  There isn&#x27;t hard data to support this, but it is the conventional wisdom of both people in the game and macro economists.<p>2. The magnitude of the impact on the asset markets is up for debate.  I&#x27;ve seen numbers as low as -5% and has high as 60% of last year&#x27;s stock market returns can be attributed to the Fed intervention.  Some of the difficulty is that there was large federal fiscal stimulus impacting during this time, and counter-intuitively there is some argument that the Fed neutralized the fiscal stimulus to hold inflation rates constant.  The important part is that there was a stock market surge, and it is not a result of retail investors pouring in money: It is a result of institutions balancing away from bonds to stocks (this is what the GP means by &quot;supply-side&quot;).  It&#x27;s just not clear if the institutions did it because they have confidence in the economy or if they were &quot;forced&quot; by the Fed.  The &quot;why&quot; is opinion, and many people believe the fed is the &quot;why.&quot;<p>3. On the micro side, seeing 20-something kids get 150k budgets to screw around for a year is maddening.  &quot;It&#x27;s ok, VCs play the numbers game... we just need one tulip to pay 100x.&quot;  There is too much money chasing &quot;talent&quot; right now, and should the correction to the asset market happen this year (as I predict from the fed&#x27;s cessation) then we will see the startup bubble unwind.",1388786756

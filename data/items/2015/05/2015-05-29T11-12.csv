If you take something like generics on its own, it is rather simple to add to a language. But once you mix it with other concepts, the complexity rises exponentially.<p>Generics + subtyping (inheritance) gives rise to a number of complex situations. Java needed to embrace bounded polymorphism in the type system in order to handle this. And we don&#x27;t know about a simpler type system which is sound and has that particular mix. If you remove subtyping and replace it with another construct, type classes or implicits, then generics are somewhat easier to fit to the language.<p>CSP turns out to be far more orthogonal, as long as you use a typed channel primitive. Hence, it is easier to fit CSP into an existing model because its composition with other type theoretic constructs is far simpler.",1432899868

I think your strategy can often be high risk since you are making a change that affects every part of your program at once -changing the runtime on a mature Python project is not a trivial choice! Changing the relevant code to tidy up data structures, or moving a few function calls to Cython or C, however, will only touch the obvious places and so it has less impact on the program.<p>Also, profiling pypy is less straightforward than profiling CPython code since the hotspot changes the runtime characteristics of the program. This means you need to run tests many times over to make sure the code warms up. This makes further optimizations slightly more difficult. It&#x27;s not a problem for people with experience optimizing Python code, but for people who actually hope to learn something from OP&#x27;s blog post, it might be a sticking point.<p>In my experience in using Python for stats, script type work (as opposed to writing servers and daemons), pypy just isn&#x27;t that useful. All the Python code is doing is gluing numpy and Cython code together and pypy isn&#x27;t likely to be able to warm up in time to beat it - and it won&#x27;t beat it since it&#x27;s spending most of its time in C.<p>Obviously, if pypy is an ideal choice for you, use it.

For the case of UDP, hopefully no one will notice, as your lost packets will just go to the next available route; for TCP connections, a route withdrawal sending you to the next nearest PoP will lead to a broken connection and clients seeing badness in their browsers.<p>Anycast is an IPv4 quirk in that it wasn&#x27;t designed; it &quot;just works&quot; because of the BGP route decision process. Yes, you can announce your prefix out of multiple PoPs, but how people choose to use the routes you announce is where things get &quot;quirky&quot;.<p>In theory there&#x27;s no difference between announcing a /24 IPv4 and asking us all to accept it, and doing the same with a /48, but in practice you&#x27;ll burn an unacceptably large amount of IP space, IMHO, and if you tell ARIN that you need a second /48 block because you burned your first with less than 25% utilization, they simply won&#x27;t let you have it.<p>Disagreed on your last point.

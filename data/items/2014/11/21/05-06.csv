Mary Schapiro was chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from 2009 to 2012, capping a distinguished career in government and private-sector regulation. Ms. Schapiro advises companies on corporate governance and compliance standards that meet regulatory and investor expectations.&quot;</i><p>Why is this so funny? Because she was running the SEC when Jed Rakoff, the judge overseeing its settlement with BoA, publicly castigated her agency on the grounds that the deal they brokered (token fine, no admission of wrongdoing) did not &quot;comport with the most elementary notions of justice and morality&quot;. So much for &quot;advising companies on corporate governance and compliance standards that meet regulatory and investor expectations.&quot;<p>And that was hardly the only bank-friendly failure on her watch. 2009-2012 is timeframe in which, famously, nobody responsible for the global-economy wrecking implosion of securities fraud on Wall St. went to jail. The DoJ said it was because the didn&#x27;t have the evidence needed to bring anyone to trial. And whose job was it to gather that evidence? That&#x27;s right, Mary Shapiro&#x27;s.<p>Usually, when people talk about the toothlessness of &quot;light-touch&quot; regulation and the rank corruption the begets regulatory capture, they cite Shapiro as an example of everything that is <i>wrong</i> with the system. You are literally the first person I&#x27;ve ever encountered who has held her up as an example of something done right.<p>Seriously, this is like getting upset about unjust sentencing laws and using Charles Manson as a case in point.<p>Also, about your boy Ben Lawsky? All of his high profile enforcement actions were <i>foreign</i> banks (Paribas, for example, is French). Hometown banks (GS, JPM, etc.) went largely untouched. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll have no trouble landing a job, but not because he was tough. He was <i>selectively</i> tough. Big difference.<p>><i>&quot;So after one does public service, they should not be allowed to work in the private sector? How is that not okay?&quot;</i><p>Dude, spare me the bullshit straw man, okay? That&#x27;s not even remotely close to what I - or anyone else who has a problem with regulatory capture - has ever said. What people who follow this stuff <i>do</i> say is that high-ranking officials responsible for setting policy or directing law enforcement should not be allowed to accept lucrative jobs from the specific companies or industries they oversaw. Why? Because those jobs are a thinly-veiled vector for outright bribery.<p>At <i>minimum</i> there needs to be a 5-7 year cooling down period before they can go to work for one of their former charges. Others say a decade, at least, if you&#x27;re serious about maintaining trust in the government.",1416549581

8640029,comment,8638977,8639231,0,0,jalonso510,,,"The decision about where to incorporate shouldn&#x27;t just be about taxes - you&#x27;re signing up for a body of corporate law and procedure and the differences can have a big impact.  And CA vs DE is just night and day in terms of user-friendliness.  Sure you could save a few hundred dollars in taxes by incorporating in CA, but you&#x27;ll burn through those savings on the first day your corporate lawyer has to address one of the many strange/frustrating things about the California Corporations Code.  Or when you need to pay a rush filing fee to amend your charter in CA because otherwise they&#x27;ll sit on it for a couple weeks.<p>If you&#x27;re running a lifestyle business that never has any corporate legal activity then maybe it won&#x27;t matter, but I think most folks would be better off minimizing legal fees (measured in hundreds per hour) instead of taxes (measured in hundreds per year).",1416549536

8640022,comment,8637614,8639176,0,0,solistice,,,"In the actual implementation of Minecraft yes, regarding the concept i disagree. I&#x27;m no game designer, but I imagine that having a block based game with similar mechanics could be implemented a lot more &quot;down to the metal&quot;. Procedural terrain generation has been around for a while, the crafting system is simple (maximum of 9 items => 1 item), and vanilla minecraft only uses less than 700 ids for blocks and items. Tool effects on blocks are relatively simple, and a lot of the other complexity can be done without (say rendering arrow flight paths or items dropped onto the floor). Which doesn&#x27;t mean the current implemenation isn&#x27;t somewhat cludged together, much to the chagrin of the modding community who don&#x27;t allways appreciate coding decisions made within the vanilla game. We&#x27;ll need to see how long the game lasts, since along with the development company Mojang being purchased by Microsoft, they don&#x27;t always handle interactions with supporting projects such as Buckit, Forge or Cauldron too gracefully.  Since they often rewrite and restructure portions of the game without providing the long promised modding API devs and modders have to completely rewrite their code between versions, which leads to high developer churn. There&#x27;s lots of drama in the community, and Mojang is invariably connected to it due to several of the senior devs stemming from the community.",1416549397

There are also no slowdowns during peak periods - providers ensure sufficiant bandwidth is available.  It seems strange to me that the US is apparently locked into cable internet where only one or two providers service entire cities.<p>(1) This is still fairly expensive but it is primarily because the majority of traffic is international and must come through fairly limited bandwidth undersea pipes.

This means that a transmitter of 100 MHz can be easily built with COTS parts, so the speeds they mention make sense to me.<p>However, when I built a cheap optical communications system with LEDs and $0.10 diodes, the tough part was always getting the photodiode capacitance low enough to receive high frequencies while still sensitive enough to detect the signal accurately[1]. This is why lasers are very popular for communications: a concentrated beam can deliver a very high signal-to-noise ratio. With LEDs, it&#x27;s tougher because the beam is dispersed and you don&#x27;t want to blind people with high power output, so the signal is a lot harder to receive. It looks like they went with nice avalanche diodes instead of cheap ones, and I&#x27;m sure that have a well-designed integrated circuit helps a lot too.

As startups are typically not in a very strong financial position, chances are that for most start ups such a choice is introducing pointless and worse potentially very costly complications. For example, a company that registers as a Delaware corporation but spends any time in Calofrnia conducting or operating its business (e.g. for YCombinator) almost certainly has to register as a foreign corporation in California and pay the minimum franchise tax. They&#x27;d have to pay the same as a corporation registered within CA (not as a foreign entity).

What I was cautioning against in my article is spending a lot of time and money on the trappings of a business -- LLC or corporation paperwork, accounting, web site, business cards, office, separate phone number, etc. You don&#x27;t need any of those things to get started freelancing, and it&#x27;s easy to get caught up in that non-productive stuff because there&#x27;s an industry profiting from selling the form and trappings of entrepreneurship, when what you really need is the substance.<p>Most networking is done with smartphones and social media these days. Business cards can be handy, but far more often I exchange email addresses and phone numbers (or Twitter handles or whatever) with someone I want to follow up with, or who may want to hire me. It&#x27;s important to be findable online. Potential customers you meet or who hear about you from someone else will more likely be looking for you by name. A blog with prominent and current contact info works, as does a public LinkedIn or GitHub profile.<p>I&#x27;m always a little skeptical of so-called freelancers who have the trappings of an important consulting firm but give the impression that <i>that&#x27;s all</i> they have.",1416546463

111436,comment,111398,111398,0,0,larrykubin,,,"I live in Austin, TX and find its size to be manageable, although it is growing fast. Is that too large for you? It has the University of Texas, its in the 'Hill Country', and has a lot of smart and creative folks. I don't have a car and ride nothing but the Capital Metro bus. The average age is pretty young here, so there are a lot of parties and such, which is a plus for some but minus for others. You will like it if you are into: lots of coffee shops with wireless access, live music (South By Southwest is just around the corner, and there are concerts all the time), lots of bars, the Texas Longhorns, attractive people, and some yuppie/hippie types. Lots of people hang out at Zilker Park (where the Austin City Limits Music Festival is) and run around Town Lake.",1202421529

111433,comment,110571,110953,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"I guess I wasn't really thinking about why choose those names.  If it was just that you could have whatever you like - I like (hd x) and (tl x) but that's me.  Or even (0 x) and (1: x) could work.  A rose is a rose and all that.<p>What I was really thinking about were things like why have pairs as a primitive and why enshrine the idea of lists as pairs linked up in a certain way?<p>From ac.scm, it looks like the current set of primitives are:<p><pre><code>  (define (ar-type x)
    (cond 
        ((ar-tagged? x)     (vector-ref x 1))
        ((pair? x)          'cons)
        ((symbol? x)        'sym)
        ((null? x)          'sym)
        ((procedure? x)     'fn)
        ((char? x)          'char)
        ((string? x)        'string)
        ((integer? x)       'int)
        ((number? x)        'num)     ; unsure about this                                                                                
        ((hash-table? x)    'table)
        ((output-port? x)   'output)
        ((input-port? x)    'input)
        ((tcp-listener? x)  'socket)
        ((exn? x)           'exception)
        (#t                 (err ""Type: unknown type"" x))))

So why that set?  Why have chars <i>and</i> strings <i>and</i> symbols?  Why have integers <i>and</i> numbers?",1202421381

111431,comment,111282,111282,0,0,thehigherlife,,,"I think the problem is when people start commenting for the sake of commenting... And the more polluted your user base the more likely that is to happen.  I mean, i'm not going to lie, i know very little about programming but i do find interest in reading the stories and comments regardless of my own inability to code.  I knew that i had nothing to bring to the table to that conversation, so i minded my own business and tried to be a good observer.  Once the user-base becomes to crowded people get a false sense of entitlement, not necessarily because they feel like the have the right to comment, but that they need to comment.  I feel that if a social news site is going to succeed they have to find a way to curb that need as the community grows.",1202421208

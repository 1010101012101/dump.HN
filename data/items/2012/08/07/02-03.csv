By that I mean medical professionals are targeted by so many groups due to their perceived high income and ability to sell very expensive drugs to customers (think what pharma reps have to do to get in front of them).<p>Not only that, but you are probably also getting a certain percentage of share of people with no ties to the medical industry.<p>Further and probably most helpful for your plan, the doctors you do get may not have an immediate need for new staff so they may say, nah, I'll figure this out later.<p>Obviously if they are figuring it out later, they never do.

Specifically, for your pulled quote it cites this: <a href=""http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter13.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter13.html</a> , and the section on ""Plutonium Toxicity"" about halfway down the page.<p>In particular, I commend to you the paragraphs starting with ""In response, I offered to inhale publicly many times as much plutonium as he said was lethal."" But more to my point:<p>""In summary, a pound of plutonium dispersed in a large city in the most effective way would cause an average of 19 deaths due to inhaling from the dust cloud during the first hour or so, with 7 additional deaths due to resuspension during the first year, and perhaps 1 more death over the remaining tens of thousands of years it remains in the top layers of soil. This gives and ultimate total of 27 eventual fatalities per pound of plutonium dispersed.""<p>I can't quite get a direct cite, but I'm pretty sure the claim that a pound of plutonium dust can kill two million people is for a pound of plutonium dust being carefully doled out to two million people in precisely the quantities that will just barely kill them, because the previous paragraph is the description of what happens if you just sort of fling it at a city.<p>And an explosion from a rocket would actually be dispersed over a much larger area than merely a large city if it were going to hit anybody at all, because we don't launch anything immediately upwind of large cities. Think state-sized dispersal and you'd be closer.<p>""There have been fears expressed that we might contaminate the world with plutonium. However, a simple calculation show [26] that even if all the world's electric power were generated by plutonium-fueled reactors, and all of the plutonium ended up in the top layers of soil, it would not nearly double the radioactivity already there from natural sources, adding only a tiny fraction of 1% to the health hazard from that radioactivity.""<p>""I have been closely associated professionally with questions of plutonium toxicity for several years, and the one thing that mystifies me is why the antinuclear movement has devoted so much energy to trying to convince the public that it is an important public health hazard. Those with scientific background among them must realize that it is a phony issue. There is nothing in the scientific literature to support their claims. There is nothing scientifically special about plutonium that would make it more toxic than many other radioactive elements. Its long half life makes it less dangerous rather than more dangerous, as is often implied; each radioactive atom can shoot off only one salvo of radiation, so, for example, if half of them do so within 25 years, as for a material with a 25-year half life, there is a thousand times more radiation per minute than emissions spread over 25,000 years, as in the case of plutonium.<p>""No other element has had its behavior so carefully studied, with innumerable animal and plant experiments, copious chemical research, careful observation of exposed humans, environmental monitoring of fallout from bomb tests, and so on. Lack of information can therefore hardly be an issue. I can only conclude that the campaign to frighten the public about plutonium toxicity must be political to the core. Considering the fact that plutonium toxicity is a strictly scientific question, this is a most reprehensible situation.""<p>And thanks for leading me to the <i>awesome</i> link to post next time this comes up.",1344308277

I guess depressed is the word.<p>We really have no control over our own data security.  I've been super paranoid about things like identity theft, and I got my identity stolen, which is something I've been dealing with over the past 2 years or so.  Somehow, my birthdate, addresses, etc were all wrong, and I had to jump through hoops to get it changed.  As well, I currently have an unpaid credit card linked to my account, and the credit agencies and the collection agency won't remove it.  The collection agency required me to submit 3 copies of my signature, a police record, copies of my identification, etc, before they'll remove it, even though THEY were the ones who made the mistake.  I went to the police station to file a report, but they needed documentation that I didn't have, since I had already changed most of the information through the credit agencies.  At this point, I froze all my accounts through the credit agencies, and I've given up.<p>The safety of my email, etc, is something that I also take extremely seriously, and now I'm being told that there's a possibility of being hacked via clever hackers piecing together information from various sources, each of which have different security procedures.  We literally have no data security except ""security through obscurity"", meaning that the likelihood of being randomly hacked is low, but if someone wants your account, they can and will get it, pretty easily it seems.<p>The industry NEEDS to standardize on very rigid set protocols on things like what information they give out, how accounts are reset, how things like credit cards are added to accounts, what information they leak, etc.  This is ridiculous.",1344307412

If your work accounts use Authenticator, even on relatively secure machines, compromising your personal laptop becomes enough to compromise the phone and thus work accounts, even if the personal laptop isn't used for those accounts.  This is a bigger problem with the iPhone due to iTunes -- people pair with a machine which has a lot of music, may be used for general downloading, shared in a family, etc.<p>The attack can be done by pwning your personal computer, waiting for you to connect your iPhone via wifi or cable to it, and then remote-proxying the display on your phone to the attacker via the compromised personal computer.  This would all be undetectable to the user.<p>Even a bad two factor system is better than passwords from a large service provider's perspective.  Two factor using a phone isn't as secure as fully independent two factor for enterprise use.<p>Add to this that many high security environments don't allow phones, or that people carry only a single device (phone or maybe phone+tablet, often), and the ""phone as two factor"" becomes a lot less useful.<p>The big problem is having to carry multiple tokens, the cost of physical tokens (including replacement/management costs), and that no one makes a decent physical token at present.<p>iOS + some kind of ""secure device-local mode"" for the OS (which couldn't be remote-accessed for display, and which doesn't get pushed in backups (keystore-like), would make something like Authenticator much closer to a physical token in security.<p>The funny thing is WP8 actually has the tools to build this, and Enterprise (i.e. huge windows deployments with good device management) is the environment where it would be useful.",1344307408

The Skycrane system was supposed to reduce the plume ground pressure during landing to the point where dust wouldn't be an issue for MSL.""</i><p><i>""But after Phoenix landed and everyone saw the pictures of pebbles ON TOP OF the pads on the bottom of the lander legs, and the legs themselves coated with a sticky looking layer of dust, some concerned folks looked at the issue more closely.  It turned out there is a core flow in the Mars Lander Engines on the descent stage that stays strong all the way to the surface, even hanging at the end of the skycrane.  And that can kick up a lot of dust+reaction products during the skycrane maneuver, some of which would go back towards the rover.  There was a review of hardware in danger of being coated with ""sticky"" dust; everything was determined to be dust tolerant EXCEPT the HazCams.""</i>",1344307254

The Android open-source code (like the WebM and other Google open source releases, IIRC) comes with a patent license (as it has to, or no other companies would touch it). From what I recall, that license permits you to use any patents the publisher (generally Google) owns that are required by that code as long as you don't sue anyone over patent infringement with respect to that same code. That makes going on the offensive with Android-related patents nearly impossible - anyone Google tried to sue could just integrate Android code related to the asserted patents to get a patent license, unless they already had Android-related patent infringement lawsuits going (which gets back to using patents defensively).",1344306576

4348304,comment,4347661,4347661,2,0,ojosilva,,,"I think we need legislation or, at least, some sort of groundwork regulation that protects user-generated content from company-issued end-user agreements tied to private takedown workflows, such as Google's content-id system. Such agreements tend to give publishers and copyright owners far too much power. I'm even thinking of left-field cases here, such as the right to control and redistribute content in the backdrop of Craiglist vs. PadMapper -- regardless of who's right or not, these two websites are fighting over content that _wasn't actually produced by either one of them_. It's come to the point where websites and their business partners have become <i>de facto</i> copyright owners of anything ever produced by mankind. What I'm saying is quite hyperbolic, I know, but just imagine a glitch in Time-Warner's top-notch automated content takedown workflow that takes down from You Tube, Vimeo and DropBox, almost instantly, a homevideo of my 8-year old son's rendition of Bach's Suite for Cello, due to a striking similarity to some piece of content supposedly owned by a prominent customer of theirs. Sounds familiar?<p>For instance, under my hypothetical legislation, Google would only be allowed to take down NASA's video if NASA accepted such action via an email notification that warned of a copyright claim by a third party. Such legislation would limit Google's liability (even further), protecting it from legal action by Scripps Local News, but most importantly, limit its power over the user's content published in its website, thus effectively (and I hope positively) diminishing Google's role as a copyright claim desk. The burden now would be on Scripps Local News to ""threaten"" (warn) the end-user of impending legal actions. This system works better the less anonymous and more accountable you, or your profile, are. OTOH, it reduces Google's persuasiveness when it comes to partnering with large media producers, which, all in all, is the heart of this content removal fever. Google's stance is to beg the user to bear with these takedown ""glitches"" because that's how we'll get to watch the full Beatles concertography for ""free"".<p>This fantasy takedown and redistribution noob legislation of mine, which has been addressed before [1], has many limitations (ie legal inconsistencies across borders), but I feel something needs to be done to better protect UGC since its existence, despite its metamorphic nature, has remained a constant for as long as we've had the internets.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content#Legal_problems_related_to_UGC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content#Legal_pr...</a>",1344304949

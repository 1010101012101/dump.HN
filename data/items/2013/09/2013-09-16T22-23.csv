6396456,comment,6394065,6395894,2,0,_delirium,,,"In theory I agree, but I <i>very</i> rarely run into people who actually do so on their own. Even fewer who do something recognizable as contributions to a research field, in the sense of writing up something of peer-reviewed paper quality, which indicates the author is familiar with existing research, appropriately explains how the new contribution relates to concepts and techniques that already exist, and presents the results in a convincing format (whether that&#x27;s statistical analysis or a good case study or whatever). It doesn&#x27;t even have to actually be published; I&#x27;m fine browsing papers on arXiv too, or things circulated as whitepapers or tech reports.<p>They exist, but they&#x27;re uncommon, and many of the people doing that kind of work are in sort of para-academic jobs, like long-time librarian at a big research library, or senior staff member at a (government or corporate) research lab. Even in an environment like Google, the majority of the papers and paper-like writeups seem to come from either people with PhDs, or people with long track records in a quasi-academic environment, like Google&#x27;s sizable stable of ex-Bell-Labs researchers.<p>I don&#x27;t really say that out of any particular love for institutionally tied research, but more out of the opposite, a frustration that it&#x27;s so rare to find DIY research that really contributes to a research field. Some of that, I assume, is just incentives: if what you earn money on involves getting something to work, all that really matters is that you come up with a technique that works. Understanding how your technique relates to existing techniques, explaining whether it&#x27;s completely novel or a variant of an established one, and doing the detailed analysis to figure out why precisely it outperforms existing techniques (e.g. is there one particular tweak that&#x27;s critical, and if so, why is it critical?), is not always something incentivized in that context, but is important to advancing the state of knowledge in a field.",1379372374

6396453,comment,6380187,6381774,1,0,magottlieb,,,"Hello, all. Many people seem to have gotten the impression from my letter that because we ran out of funds paying for the conversion of FLP Volume I from LaTeX to HTML we need additional funds to complete the conversion. However, that is not the case because some chapters of Vols. II & III were also converted for us (though imperfectly), and after comparing the Vol. I HTML to the original LaTeX, I found I could do the conversion myself quite easily using parametrized regular expression search and replace operations and a minimum of hand-editing. I am able to convert one chapter of FLP from the LaTeX to HTML in about 2 hours. I have been working on completing the remaining Vols. II & III chapters in my spare time, and they are very nearly done. Only a few chapters remain to be converted, and a few others only need some HTML tables. We are planning to make a second release when our two PDF editions (formatted for the desktop and for tablets) are available for sale online. In fact, the PDF editions have been ready for a long time, but the publisher is having some difficulties getting them into their retailers&#x27; sales queues. Today we have the first evidence of the publisher&#x27;s success in resolving the difficulties:<p><a href=""https://www.cafescribe.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&categoryId=152754&langId=-1&productId=4000000000003036262&storeId=216405&productStoreId=216405"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cafescribe.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product...</a><p>So, hopefully it will not be long before we add the completed Vols.

For one you really don&#x27;t seem familiar with Wine, which despite being run by a ragtag group of developers already has brought legacy support for most Windows games on Linux.<p>The bluray argument is largely moot. 
Valve and the game industry at large could care less about it, with consoles as the exception.
Gabe and his team only have to present a console with an advantage over existing consoles (modular build is a huge deal) with a distro that is stable. With the impressive bases already in existence, and OpenGL being a fullfledged match for Direct X it&#x27;s a no-brainer that Valve has what it takes to pull this off.<p>Lastly I&#x27;d like to point out the Linux community is not uniformly against closed source. What makes our veins pop is stuff like hardware OEMs not releasing driver sources, making development and innovation a pain.

Genocide is defined as the deliberate killing of a group of people.  I&#x27;m sure the Europeans and early Americans had microscopes to make sure those blankets were infected before giving them to the Native Americans.<p>The imagery wasn&#x27;t stolen.  Mexico had cowboys (vaqueros) before us.  Did they have a patent on what clothes to wear?  Cowboys look like cowboys because of the utility of their clothes, not because of some sense of fashion.  Try working on a ranch in a suit and top hat.<p>Did you ever study history?  I recommend that rather than regurgitating other people&#x27;s delusions.  Texas was not stolen.  The people who lived in Texas revolted and drove out the Mexican soldiers.  Texas then became its own Republic.  Texas later joined the United States voluntarily.<p>Perhaps the game of Cowboys and Indians is culturally insensitive.  I don&#x27;t know anyone who hates Indians because of it, or wants to go hunt them or any other humans in real life.  The public school I went to did a pretty good job teach us about the plight of the Native Americans.

6396399,comment,6392545,6395228,8,0,pcwalton,,,">  Interfaces with multiple dispatch would basically be Haskell typeclasses.<p>Typeclasses are completely different from Go interfaces in a way that&#x27;s totally unrelated to single versus multiple dispatch: in Haskell they&#x27;re a bound on generic functions that specifies permissible operations, while Go interfaces are existential wrapped values. To give a concrete example of the difference here, you can write a function that takes a List of Eq values and pass a list of integers to it in Haskell, but in Go you cannot pass []int to a function that takes []Equal without recreating the list. On the other hand, in Go you can have a heterogeneous array of Equal interfaces, while in Haskell this is not possible without existential types.<p>> they&#x27;re hard to type-inference (Haskell&#x27;s type system is undecidable in some cases)<p>This is only when you combine the feature with type inference for functions (which Go doesn&#x27;t have) and H-M style inference (which Go also doesn&#x27;t have). Typeclasses would pose no problems for Go&#x27;s extremely limited inference.<p>Pitting typeclasses against interfaces makes little sense to me; typeclasses are an enhancement to generics, while interfaces are about runtime polymorphism. Typeclasses have no meaning in a language without generics like Go (although I personally think Go will need generics eventually).",1379371804

If you no longer believe in God, you&#x27;re not a Christian, you&#x27;re an impostor. But Jewishness is decided by whether you were born Jewish or converted to Judaism. If either of those is true, you are a Jew, regardless of what you believe. None of the laws are predicated on believing in God (the one I mentioned before from the ten commandments precludes believing in other deities, but apparently permits atheism).<p>What makes someone a &quot;bad Jew&quot; is failing to practice Judaism. But there&#x27;s no incentive to conduct a witchhunt over it, so there&#x27;s no incentive for rhetoric about the importance of belief. I belong to a Conservative synagogue and I have never heard a sermon about the importance of believing in God. It isn&#x27;t important. Ethical behavior is, and that is the content of our sermons.<p>It may be difficult to see a point to practicing if you don&#x27;t believe in God, but, again, I know people who find value in the symbolism and the ritual and the religion&#x27;s capacity to shape ethical behavior despite not believing in a supernatural being or origin. The entire Reconstructionist movement teaches that Judaism and the Bible were created by mankind. It may be a small movement, but it is real thing, and I know Conservative Jews who are atheists but still get value out of the practice.<p>I&#x27;m sure you will be able to find a marginal rabbi (probably &quot;Orthodox&quot;, a self-applied label by a movement younger than the Reform) who will activate your confirmation bias.

You assemble a database of tech companies and their histories -- what happened to them over time, how they were funded, how their stock fared. Then, when you want to evaluate a new company, you compare it to your database, see how other similar companies evolved. You get a statistical sense of the possible outcomes.<p>Using that data, you invest in companies based on the probability that they will be successful, and the share price is part of the gamble (and it is certainly a gamble). In fact, if you think about it, the fact that the share price is high means other people are doing the same probabilistic calculation and bidding up the price as well.<p>It&#x27;s not an accident -- it&#x27;t a lot of people betting the company will succeed.

They are completely appropriate there.<p>The guy who replied to you is correct, as everyone who paid attention in Econ 101 is aware: there is no reason for the US Federal Government to default, ever. It dictates the literal amount of its monetary units that exist on earth (another thing carefully defined and explained in Econ 101) by extending credit. It extends this credit with no collateral, no limits and no need for leverage. They create money when they want to for any reason, and they don&#x27;t when they don&#x27;t want to for any reason. They can, tomorrow, instruct the Fed to create $17T (roughly the national &quot;debt&quot;) and credit it to whoever they want. The key difference between a central bank and all other entities: when it extends credit, it does not create a matching liability in the government&#x27;s accounting. The central bank, or rather something with the power of a central bank, is the only entity in a society that can do this. That&#x27;s what the &quot;sole power to dictate the supply of money&quot; means.<p>Any logic developed while thinking about debt carried by people, companies, cities or states, all of whom must add liabilities to their accounting books when they take on debt, does not apply to the entity that controls the central bank for the monetary units in question. Anytime anyone expresses concern about the national &quot;debt&quot; as if it wasn&#x27;t something Congress could wave away with a pen in 15 minutes, they&#x27;re being ignorant at best and disingenuous at worst.<p>It is absolutely critical that you read up on and understand this.

(This is ostensibly to guard against attacks on the RNG using scan mode. That could very well be true; I don&#x27;t have enough domain knowledge in designing secure hardware to know whether this is a common practice or not.)<p>Detecting stuck-at faults is one of the main applications of scan testing[1]. Generally coverage isn&#x27;t perfect, but by spending more time and making particular implementation decisions one can make coverage pretty close to arbitrarily good.<p>Moreover, I can always choose to randomize my scan chains if I think this is a threat, and then an attacker will have to assume that he&#x27;s only allowed to modify gates that can&#x27;t be covered by any possible scan chain. Remember, the attacker has to modify the mask, so that means I&#x27;m making a large number of chips that all have the same flaw. So if I detect stuck-at faults using randomized scan chains on any wafer in a lot and I&#x27;m paranoid, I can re-run the failing scan chain on other chips from the same lot to determine whether it&#x27;s systematic or random failure.<p>Lest you think this is an inconvenient test to perform, almost all digital chips are scanned because it&#x27;s one of the fastest ways to detect manufacturing defects. Unlike rewiring a chip, generating stuck-at faults is a really bad way of being sneaky if the target circuit is being scanned, because as I said above that&#x27;s a type of error against which scan is quite good.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan_chain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan_chain</a>",1379370629

In the US, the shoreline up to some strangely defined highwater mark (which is higher than you expect) is public. Canada has a similar deal related to crown lands (you may own the island, but the bit under the water, not so much). These visitors have every legal right to hang out, have a picnic, play jarts, whatever.<p>When you aren&#x27;t around you will get more visitors. (I have pretty good camera surveillance, mainly to enjoy from afar, but I also get to see the visitors.) These will be bolder and walk around and look at the place.<p>If you aren&#x27;t around and the local environment is right, you may get hunters. We get duck hunters and goose hunters. We generally give a few people we know permission and kind of rely on them to discourage anyone else. Hunters are territorial. One year it was posted with &quot;No Hunting&quot; signs nailed to the dock, but not by us or anyone we know, a good attempt by a hunting hacker to secure himself a private hunting area.<p>Have a medical evac plan.

Also, know when you are pinned down by weather.<p>A food digesting composter keeps your trash bags from getting disgusting.<p>If there is cell coverage, but only for odd carriers, consider an &quot;island phone&quot; that just stays there.

First of I am of course worried about competition, the potential market isn&#x27;t really that big. But what bothers me more is that I am afraid of looking like an imitator, someone who stole someone else&#x27;s great (yet simple) idea.<p>The (future) competitor has a really solid application, seems to have quickly grown quite the customer base.<p>Now, I know for a fact that my app have just a few more feature  and to be quite frank; looks better in most ways. But when I finally launch for the public I am afraid that people will just point fingers and say &quot;Hey, he stole that idea straight from those poor guys and just added some features!&quot;.<p>What would you do in this situation? Work even more, and harder to have the application behave a bit different to try differentiate them more? Just launch and see which one of our applications will stick? Call it a day and take up another project?<p><i>Yes</i>, I know that similar and almost identical apps already exists everywhere. But to have two of them launch at almost the same time for an extremely limited niche market? Thoughts?",1379368950

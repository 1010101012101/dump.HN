Whilst he's great at what he does (marketing), he's not great at doing what he tells others to do.<p>Let me take the example from the article regarding the B52s as a case in point.<p>One commenter has already mentioned that similar items are listed in Amazon.<p>Another point is that in doing the CD giveaway, you're not making a sale (unless you sell the whole package at a profit, which may be lower than your normal profit due to differences between new and used CDs).<p>Yet another point is that the CD giveaway is only effective if you know your target market. If you think you sound like the B52s, then great. If the buyer only likes Rock Lobster by the B52s or the Flintstones you've not really gained much (unless your 'giveaway' was profitable).<p>My final point is this. In the example of the CD giveaway, he missed something: What you really want is dedicated fans of the B52s to talk about your music. This means that you may need to start the conversation. You'll need to get bloggers, community forums etc. to talk about you as an Amazon seller, to talk about your band and to use the opportunity to raise awareness. Giving away the CDs to people who buy B52s music on Amazon alone is not going to achieve this.<p>As usual from Seth Godin, it's interesting advice in a kind of 'why didn't I think of that' way, but the applicability of it changes substantially once you give it some thought.<p>On a final note, has anyone else noticed a distinct increase in the amount of Seth Godin material linked to from here? I get the feeling that not all this is strictly relevant to HN...",1220291810

There wasn't anything wrong with it, just I've read many articles with this same pattern and unless the details of the chase interest me, I'd just as soon cut to the end.<p>EDIT: And don't you mean ""gripping"" instead of ""griping"" The first, I believe is to grip something, whereas the second is to complain.

291995,comment,291855,291933,0,0,RobGR,,,"You say ""Also why target such a niche when you can target everyone with an internet connection.""<p>The answer is, that targeting everyone with an internet connection is not targeting.  It's called carpet bombing the internet, and it's expensive.  Invariably, you can't carpet bomb the whole internet, so you only carpet bomb a tiny faction, which ends up being chosen not by smarts, but by chance and the nature of whatever advertising you are doing.<p>Even if you just upload tracks and let people ""pirate"" your whole album, you are leaving it up to chance that the people want your music will find it.  People do not download every free track out there and listen to every single one just because it's free.  So putting it out there for free is not an automatic answer -- it's better than changing $15 a CD and then just waiting, but it's still a pretty basic attempt.<p>The example given is expensive and time consuming.  It doesn't have to expensive in money, you could buy used B-52 CDs and re-sell them at cost, for example, but it will be time consuming and take care and attention to detail to do it right.  But seems likely to me that any success in internet marketing will take time, money (or even more time), and care and miticulous attention to detail.  It's just not as easy as it was when banner ads were first invented.",1220288726
291994,comment,291946,291984,0,0,neilk,,,"They just renewed the contract with Mozilla. That's got nothing to do with it. And there's not nearly enough competition in browsers. Sure, there are lots of projects, but few of them are serious contenders for the average Windows user -- maybe Opera and Firefox qualify, but that's about it.<p>If you've ever tried to write a complex web app you immediately bang your head against the low, low ceiling afforded by the browser. Google knows this as well as anybody and it impedes adoption of Google apps like Gmail or Docs. Making the browser into a better platform is good for their business -- note they are giving away their spiffy new JS engine and the whole thing is open source.<p>If Firefox adopted their innovations tomorrow or one-upped them, I'm sure the Chrome team would be very happy.",1220288643

<a href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf05.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf05.htm</a><p><i>Most radiation exposure is from natural sources. These include: radioactivity in rocks and soil of the earth's crust; radon, a radioactive gas from the earth and present in the air; and cosmic radiation. About one quarter of natural radiation comes from the human body itself. The human environment has always been radioactive and accounts for up to 85% of the annual human radiation dose.<p>Radiation arising from human activities typically accounts for up to 25% of the public's exposure every year. This radiation is no different from natural radiation except that it can be controlled. X-rays and other medical procedures account for most exposure from this quarter. The rest comes from coal burning, appliances, and other industrial and research procedures.<p>Less than 1% of exposure is due to the fallout from past testing of nuclear weapons or the generation of electricity in nuclear, as well as coal and geothermal power plants.</i><p>That link includes a table of background-radiation by nation in millisieverts (mSv).",1220288548

The verbose message is only there as a point of clarity.<p>When you get into user-interaction design, you learn that redundancy is important. You don't put something in one place and make them look for it. You put it where they'd naturally look.<p>For example, if you go to a large store, masking tape won't be only in one place because people are seeking different ""core"" uses. So the same brand/package of tape will be found in the hardware section, the painting section, the crafts section, and school supplies.<p>The fallacy with Boolean yes/no buttons for every dialog window is that if the user doesn't read the message, they may not get the results they expected.

380313,comment,379948,380190,0,0,GHFigs,,,"I would think the _latter_ serves more to clarify the former than the other way around.  Generally that's the way it works.  Surely, in a lifetime of communication you have at one point or another misspoken or been misunderstood and had to clarify your meaning.  Would it be fair for listeners to disregard your later statements entirely simply because they came later?<p>Your casting a volunteer program as ""forced labor"" strongly indicates that you have a political opinion on what the interpretation _ought_ to be.  It would be _convenient_ for you if that interpretation would be correct, but it would not be _accurate_.<p>Not only is the latter in line with the plan (to require service in exchange for the tax credit) outlined well before the election, but it also has the advantage of actually making sense in context.  Why would a page describing expansion of established volunteer services suddenly shift to mean mandatory service?  And for students only?  And then go right back to talking about voluntary services?  It would make little sense to have the meaning of an entire page hinge on a single word in a middle paragraph, and even if it were an accurate representation of intent, the sentence itself is utterly bungled.  Calling it obfuscation is senseless, too, given how freely the site expresses other plans that many find disagreeable.<p>You want people to believe that the President-Elect is only willing to express major, substantial changes in policy via one word on one page of one site at one time, now past? Please.",1227988244

I've gotten more productive output in C++ coding over the last 3 years than Java, which I worked on for 6 years before that.<p>And I'm starting to discover that I am more productive in C than C++ which started me wondering about OOPs and what I believed to be established wisdom.

Telus does seem to try and innovate, but it's trapped on the CDMA network but is releasing a HSPA in 2010. Rogers already has the HDSPA and has for a while, Bell has the CDMA high-speed mobile, which barely any handset manufacturers actually provide new phones in CDMA.<p>I actually wish I could move near the Falls so that I could steal T-Mobile USA off my old T-Mobile UK phone.

380289,comment,379942,380254,0,0,jamiequint,,,"If you're really interested in this stuff you should contact a visa lawyer, email me and I can give you the name of a good one who will probably discuss your options with you for free. The following is just my experience, and not legal advice:<p>You don't have to hold any sort of visa to own a part of a company in the US. However, you cannot get paid legally (there are probably some exceptions with liquidity events) in the US without a visa and a social security number.<p>Some tricks involve setting up a foreign subsidiary that wholly owns or is wholly owned by the US company, then paying yourself as a consultant of the foreign company. This can work with UK companies, I can't speak for other countries though. Also, if you have such a foreign company that you can prove you worked for for a year in managerial capacity you can possibly qualify for an L-1 intra-company transferee visa.<p>The best route to a US visa is probably to stay in school. Don't worry about grades too much, but try to do things that get you recognition within the scientific community, maybe do some research and publish a paper or two. Basically, this is padding your resume for application for an O-1 (Alien of Extraordinary Ability) visa later.<p>One of the best options if you don't think you can qualify for that is to get a J-1 training visa. It is a very easy visa to get after you graduate and is good for 12-18 months depending on your prior work experience. You can then use this time to do things that push you closer to O-1 status so you can apply for that at the end of your J-1 or you can try and get lucky with the H1-B.<p>All of these things (except the L-1) require a US citizen co-founder who will fill out most of these forms and apply on behalf of you. In our company I'm that guy, so thats how I know all this stuff. Good luck!",1227985925

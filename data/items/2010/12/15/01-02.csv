2006691,comment,2004833,2006453,0,0,alanh,,,"If I’m remembering my discrete math correctly, your claim isn’t correct:<p>> <i>… Let's assume 2 choices of work factor. Also let's assume strong passwords of length 8 have 96^8 ~= 53 bits of entropy and eak passwords of length 8 or less have 27^8 ~= 38 bits of entropy.</i><p>> <i>You just let me cut the search space for strong passwords of length 8 to to ~15 bits…</i><p>You can’t subtract bits of entropy like that.<p>Here’s something I hope will convince you this reasoning is faulty.<p>Imagine a universe of 3-digit passwords, and there are two kinds of passwords: Strong ones use a mix of digits 0–7, and weak ones only use the digits '0' or '1'.<p>You could see the strong passwords could be any of 8^3 = 512 different combinations (~9 bits of entropy), except the 2^3 = 8 combinations (3 bits of entropy) that would only contain ones and/or zeros. So while a worst-case for brute-forcing a known-weak password is trying 8 strings, the worst-case for brute-forcing a <i>known-strong</i> password is trying 504 strings. This is still the same order of magnitude, and still approx. 9 bits of entropy! You removed such an incredibly small sliver of passwords, that an attacker really isn’t any better off than before.<p>Another way to think of this is, just because the user didn’t use <i>only</i> lowercase letters, doesn’t mean that none of the characters are!<p>Back to your example, with a strong password search space of 96^8.  Now if you know a password is strong, that means it isn’t one of the 27^8 possible weak passwords.  By how much does this reduce our search space?<p>  7,213,895,789,838,336 <i>possible strings of length 8</i><p>- 0,000,282,429,536,481 <i>possible 'weak' 8-char passwords</i><p>= 7,213,613,360,301,855 <i>possible 'strong' 8-char passwords</i><p>We’ve reduced our search space by only .0039%.<p>That said, rolling your own crypto — which the grandparent post isn’t really quite doing — is something you should run away from, fast, unless you really are a cryptographer!",1292378334

A PC gaming related sites I visited often started doing some dynamic pages with Perl (this was the late 90s), and I just thought that was the bees knees, so I went off to learn Perl. I wrote a simple guestbook style script for a little site I had, uploaded it, went to the browser and got a nice 'Internal Server Error'. I read every line of code I had written, couldnt find the error, then realized my FTP client was set to upload in binary rather than ASCII. Uploaded the script again in the right mode, went to the site, and it worked. I didn't even know the difference between the two at the time.<p>It's not really an 'aha moment' that's on the same level as others mentioned here, but it was the first script I ever wrote.

There is nothing that shames either of those contenders, and I would argue that there are few that even legitimately compete with them.<p>Having said that, I couldn't agree more regarding <i>the community</i>. When MVC came out my only excitement about it -- given that I had been doing something better with .NET for closing on a decade -- was that the default baseline would hopefully be better than the terrible abomination that is WebForms (a construct either made to cripple web development, or to hold the hands of Visual Basic developers with a big viewstate diaper). But otherwise the excitement was hard to accept because it wasn't like it was actually something new, or something that you couldn't already do yourself with minimal effort. I'm seeing the same thing with some of the concurrency additions in .NET 4, where some trivial constructs are blessed with some syntactical sugar and it's treated like it's a new revolution in development.<p>Which brings up another oddity of the .NET community in general: There is a tendency to embrace and vigorously adopt whatever abstraction Microsoft grunts out, regardless of merit or actual value that it adds. The simplest need becomes layers of poorly contrived, poor fitting abstractions, where developers instead of asking ""why <i>should</i> I use this?"" instead are too busy worrying about ""why <i>didn't</i> you use that?"" The former question is much more valuable, but the latter is the defensive reaction of too many.

2006585,comment,2003515,2003515,0,0,Mz,,,"Having read the story and read a lot of the posts and discussion in this thread, a few thoughts come to mind:<p>1) I once had a flat tire that a homeless person offered to change.  Yes, he was hoping to make a few bucks.  I was still very ill at the time and desperately needed to get something to eat.  Having him change it meant it got done faster than if I had tried to call someone, which mattered because every minute counts when my blood sugar is low.  We talked while he worked and I found out he had been staying in a cheap dive of a hotel and was trying to come up with enough to sleep there that night instead of the streets.  I gave him $60.  I later found out it would have cost less to call someone. I didn't care.  It was worth it to me to get to an eatery a few minutes faster.  My blood sugar was low and I was really in crisis.  I had a ""middle class"" lifestyle but in some sense was in no less need than the homeless man.<p>2) I think the whole generosity thing is typical of successful business people because creating something of value is what makes them successful.  ""Business people"" who are little more than con artists and are doing their best to separate you from your money without really creating something of value often land in jail or just go out of business when folks realize it isn't worth what they spent.  It isn't always obvious in the short run, but in the long run creating something of real value is the only way to stay in business and make money.  It seems to be counterintuitive to many, yet ""pay it forward"" and similar philosophies are rooted in that same idea/value/orientation of doing something of real value in the world.<p>3) I tend to live by the idea that if you want to live in a better world, the best way to make sure you do is roll your sleeves up and get to work on it.  So in some sense, I am generous to other people out of selfishness, though I can't quite think how to explain that.  <shrug>",1292376003

For instance, you could set X so high that it takes a minimum of 1 second to respond to a request. That is probably not necessary. The real answer is you need to take the estimated minimum amount of time to calculate one of hash using the function you have chosen. Then compute using that number as the basis the minimum number of rounds to assure reasonable security for a single password. Reasonable security could be it would take 1 year to a do a full dictionary attack alphanumeric only or perhaps 1 month or 1 week. The value you choose for the time it takes to brute force one password is the level of protection you are providing your users.<p>EDIT:\nalso what Thomas said. It is in the standard that 1000 should be the minimum value. I would use higher based on the level of protection you want to give your users.

Of course, your opponent is moving the “center” the opposite direction at the same time, following the same rules.<p>You can switch between the spells at any time, but time spent switching is time not spent swiping.<p>The idea is to push the “center” of the beam all the way to your opponent, where he takes damage and the center is reset.  Take damage three times and you lose.<p>It definitely would work much better with Harry Potter characters and spells, possibly a marketing tie-in to Deathly Hallows part 2.<p>Add sparks and glows and all manner of cool sound effects and special effects.  Include sound bytes from the characters battling.<p>Make one kid ridiculously happy.",1292375023

This feature allows you to define a sequence of keypresses, which KeePass can automatically perform for you. The simulated keypresses can be sent to any other currently open window of your choice (browser windows, login dialogs, ...).<p>By default, the sent keystroke sequence is {USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}, i.e. it first types the user name of the selected entry, then presses the Tab key, then types the password of the entry and finally presses the Enter key.</i><p>For sites or apps with weird forms you can customize the sequence.<p><a href=""http://keepass.info/help/base/autotype.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keepass.info/help/base/autotype.html</a>",1292374964

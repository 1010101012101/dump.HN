Everything is consistent with a white background and black text, and I can scan the text quickly.<p>With coding, my preference is exactly the opposite (I prefer a black background).  The difference is that the structure of a program is much more complicated than the structure of prose and that structure is more apparent with white/colors on a black background.  Further, the colors of syntax highlighting seem to be much more apparent when displayed on a black screen rather than on white.",1324403974

Just wanted to point out its not all a bed of roses.<p>For the last month I've been interviewing at some really amazing startups. What I've found is that I have no problem getting interviews at some of the best startups (>50% response rate) because well everyone wants someone who can code and design . The problem is that I have to fight an uphill battle to prove that I'm not just a designer that writes HTML/CSS. There is ALWAYS the question of ""so...how good are your frontend skills?"" with an intonation of doubt. No one actually bothers to ask or determine about the level of your design skills. Another question is ""which one do you prefer?"". I really hate that question because it shows you don't understand what a product focused engineer is.<p>Positive response <i>really</i> depends on the stage of a startup. I'm finding that teams between 5-20 are looking more for specialists in design and engineering. Any smaller or bigger and a desingineer becomes a very valuable role to fill. So  feeling I'm missing out on opportunities at some great startups cause of this phenomenon. Would e interested to know if anyone else has experienced this?<p>It's definitely causing me to think about my career path. Do I focus on one or the other? I know I am not great at both and that is because I have to spread myself thin in both areas and dont know the best tools and practices as well as I should.<p>Being a desingineer makes it really easy to start your own thing be it a startup or side project - I've done it a few times myself. However, sometimes you need financial stability, or are waiting for a significant idea, or just want to work with other really smart people on an idea with traction to gain more experience.<p>So we aren't unicorns and it's definitely not a double-rainbow life.",1324403890

So for you computational physics students out there, consider the effects of a current in a moving current where the conductivity is determined by temperature and pressure. That is a simulation that has to take into account the thermodynamics of heat transfer out of the core, the temperature changing effects of constricting magnetic fields, and the effects of shock waves in a fluid in motion.<p>Basically we don't have the science to describe the behavior of a planetary core made up of this type of material!

I think the thing that helped me most was that I started learning design by coding (i.e. I started writing XHTML/CSS alongside learning design principles). Being about four years in now, it's great to be able to get a project and say ""yeah, I can code that."" It really just takes time and patience. While my coding experience is mainly focused around front-end development, what I've learned from the front-end has helped me to feel comfortable with Wordpress and PHP.

I started off as a visual designer, then learned HTML and CSS, then Javascript, then out of necessity began maintaining an old ASP Classic codebase. As soon as I started to understand the code I was reading, things got easier. Then I built a small data-backed web app and I was totally hooked. In the last two years, I've learned to build nontrivial web apps from the ground up. SQL, MVC, Backbone, UI, design. I'm pretty proficient at each level of the stack, but only insofar as it's related to the web. Eg. I know C#, but I wouldn't have the first clue about how to write a native Windows application. So I end up feeling like my knowledge is the proverbial mile wide and inch deep.<p>I'm looking for jobs right now, and it's been an exercise in frustration. The coding jobs require CS degrees, 5 years of experience, tech interviews with big-O notation and data structures (trying to teach myself basic CS theory, but need a job now).

If you consider the early days, Jobs only looks like a business guy if you stand him next to Woz.<p>Anyway, I think I can say without exaggeration that I'm better than average in both engineering and design. At least for me, I think you have to be born that way -- you get pleasure both from aesthetics, and from solving problems. And when left alone by a world that sees both as separate, you just do your thing.<p>I started got a computer when I was 11. Other people played games. It seemed completely natural to me to spend almost all my time programming pretty graphics demos.<p>But how do you get any better? I think you have to be the kind of person who seeks challenges, who seeks a ladder to climb.<p>For computing, I think we all know that drill. Open source has made it so that you can start anywhere and go all the way to OS development, if that's what you want. You can also get work (even if you have little experience) and use other people's resources to educate yourself.<p>For design, it's a bit harder. Perhaps I was lucky in that I continually wavered between science and engineering, and design and journalism.<p>In my teens and early 20s, I was the production/layout guy at student newspapers. So I could educate myself, with thousands of dollars of other people's money, in a way that was almost ridiculously unsupervised. That sharpened my appreciation for typography, photography, design, etc., as well as gave me some experience managing people, budgets and deadlines. But I guess that other people in that role might not have gone as crazy as I did for the design aspect. Especially for the entertainment sections (where design was allowed to be more fun) I was trying to top myself with every single issue that I did. You know that you're doing it right when (a) the bloody thing actually makes printing deadline, week after week (b) you walk around the university and you see people putting your layouts up as a poster.",1324402885

For each record with id n in the public.tenants table, I have another schema tenant_n cloned from and kept in sync with the template_tenant schema.<p>The result of this is that I have dozens of tables duplicated across n schemas. In Rails 3.1, the Postgres query cache, exec cache, and the identity map do not account for this, nor does table_exists?, and the connection pool would often check out a new connection without preserving the search path.<p>In Rails 3.2, most of these are fixed. The exec cache, query cache, and table_exists? now observe the search_path properly, and I believe the connection pool behaves better, though I haven't had time to confirm that. The identity map still doesn't understand, which I've filed an issue for: <a href=""https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/4044"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/4044</a><p>I'm really happy with this pattern for multi-tenant apps. It gives me a lot more confidence that no data leaks will happen than scoping queries, and the performance increase is significant with large datasets (unless of course, for some reason, you need to aggregate across tenants). It's nice to see rails supporting this better.<p>The sixth patch I had hacks support for iterating over multiple schemas to migrations. I add ""schema_set :public or :tenant"" to the top of my migration, and it runs either once on the public schema, or n+1 times on my template_tenant schema and my tenant_X schemas.

She's a pretty sharp individual, but not tech-savvy, and even though I explained that in that case she could just sign up for a different service, she still decided it was too risky to rely on.<p>For me, after reading HN for a while now, I've gotten a toin coss mentality towards whether or not a particular startup will still be around in a year.<p>My hunch is that several classes of web-based startups are headed for trouble and don't realize it yet. If you're building a game, if you're building a Facebook app, if you're building something that people don't feel like they have to rely on, you're fine. But, if you're trying to address a major business problem or build something that people will have to trust for the long term, I think your pool of available customers is shrinking, not growing.<p>The funny thing is that what the customers want is lifestyle businesses -- businesses that the founders are totally invested in and wanting to work on for a very long time -- and lifestyle businesses catch a lot of derision in startup circles.",1324402649

I actually think most (good) devs and designers have slight inclinations towards each others work, but it is a serious effort to go from ""that does look cool/useful"" to professional proficiency.  The few people who are currently 'designineers' are mostly likely completely passionate about both (which is their motivator). However for the rest why put in the effort? My understanding is that the pay isn't much different (in fact this sounds a lot like, ""wouldn't it be great if I could get 2 for the price of 1"").  Easier to find a job?

3374223,comment,3373672,3373672,11,0,ekidd,,,"Haskell doesn't really do inheritance, unless you somehow get O'Haskell to work on a modern machine.<p>In place of inheritance, you have two mechanisms: algebraic data types and type classes. They work great for many programs, but neither of them is an exact fit for Java-style object-oriented programming.<p>An algebraic data type has a name (""Bool"", in the first example below), and several constructors (""True"" and ""False""). Constructors can take positional and named arguments, and they can take type parameters:<p><pre><code>    data Bool = True | False\n    data Shape =\n        Square { l :: Int, t :: Int, w :: Int, h :: Int }\n      | Circle Int Int Int\n    data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing\n</code></pre>\nOnce you define an algebraic data type, you can't add new constructors. But you can write functions which match against the existing constructors at runtime, giving you a form of runtime dispatch vaguely analogous to method lookup:<p><pre><code>    boolToString :: Bool -> String\n    boolToString True = ""true""\n    boolToString False = ""false""\n</code></pre>\nSo algebraic data types work great if you have one abstract interface with known set of concrete subclasses. It's a <i>really</i> great way to think about complex data structures with multiple types of nodes.<p>A type class is a little bit like a C++ template protocol: It says that a given type implements a set of functions. But as with C++ templates, it's effectively resolved at compile time. (Well, the implementation is quite a bit different, but that's the rough idea.)<p>Now, ADTs and type classes are great. But if you find yourself using crazy hacks to recreate an OO class hierarchy in Haskell, you're probably fighting against the language.

3374191,comment,3373702,3373702,12,0,tedkimble,,,"Engineering and designing are much more similar than they are different.<p>I recently completed a four-year graduate design degree (architecture) after a lifetime of math, physics and not a whip of art or design experience. Here's my take on this issue.<p>Engineering and design are both fundamentally processes of creation. While both creations must meet one or more objectives, the types of those objectives often differ. Engineers tend to optimize for quantitative objectives and criteria; designers tend to optimize for qualitative objectives and criteria.<p>I think this difference has two significant consequences:<p>1. The solution space for designers (or anything with qualitative criteria) is much larger than for engineers.\n2. There are many more opportunities for mediocre design than there are for mediocre engineering.<p>By point 2., I mean that not only is the solution space of design much larger, but there are also many more ""attractors"" of solutions. In engineering, the attractors have a strong pull and are more recognizable as such. And, because the solution space is more quantifiable, the relations between those solutions are more well understood and comparable.<p>In design, the attractors are more fuzzy and their locations in the solution space are often unknown. This allows anyone who can find a mediocre design solution (especially those who find ""pretty"" visual ones) to become a ""designer"". But good designers must do much more. They must understand the design space enough so that, from any starting point, they can justifiably navigate towards that same design solution.<p>This involves crossing certain thresholds -- bifurcations -- in which the nature of the design solution changes. Recognizing when to cross these thresholds is, in my opinion, a task perfectly suited for analytical thinkers. You don't need to be able to create visually pleasing designs to find the best design solutions. Visual aesthetics are simply one component of optimizing the already discovered design solution.<p>So my advice to engineers is this: forget about visuals. Design analytically, question the existence of design components and their relationships. If you cannot justify their existences and relationships, you need to somehow change their nature (bifurcate the design) until you can justify it. Often starting from the bottom-up is the best way to accomplish this.<p>Once a design solution is in sight, optimizing its visual aesthetics is much easier -- you've already framed its problem so well!<p>Finally, I must note the three tasks which are essential to the design process: research, experimentation and documentation. Surely these tasks are also vital to engineers, or anyone else involved in processes of creation.<p>---<p>(PS If anyone would like to talk about how many of the concepts of dynamical systems theory can be used in the design process (and the design itself!), I'd love to hear form you!)",1324401228
3374190,comment,3373702,3373702,31,0,tibbon,,,"I am a designineer. The problem is that it doesn't make you an expert of all skills. Jack of all trades, master of none.<p>While I took AP CS in high school, I can't rattle off the to O-notation of most algorithms. While I took plenty of art and design classes over the years, I'm no Jony Ives.<p>But, its not about what I can't do in my mind, but what I can do. I learn most things very quickly. I'm decent in Ruby and can get stuff done. I can get around Photoshop decently. I'm good at understanding what the customer wants and the product needs. I know how the pieces glue together. I don't mind meeting with VCs, talking to customers or interviewing people.<p>Yet contrary to popular belief, I don't find people bashing down my door. I don't have the sexiest Github account. The startups I've worked for aren't huge. When I'm asked what I do I reply, ""Coding, marketing, product and design"". Then they ask if I'm a Java or Ruby coder with 4-7 years of solid experience and a CS background.<p>Maybe the difference is I don't see myself as being a ""full stack"" guy, but a ""full company"" guy. I understand what everyone needs to be doing, and I have (often good) ideas of how a problem might be approached better.<p>I personally see myself as a huge asset to any company. I often end up doing the productivity of 2-3 people with more traditional backgrounds, but its a really hard sell honestly. I could try selling myself as a manager I suppose, but I'm not sure.",1324401226

Debate continues about his considered views, but there is little doubt that his bolder claims, unimpeded by caveats or qualifications, were better suited to captivate his readers than more timid claims would have been.<p>When languages are similar, Whorf tells us, there is little likelihood of dramatic cognitive differences. But languages that differ markedly from English and other Western European languages (which Whorf calls, collectively, Standard Average European or SAE) often do lead their speakers to have very different worldviews.<p>- - - End Quote<p>and also<p>- - - Quote [2]<p>...the strong version of the SapirWhorf hypothesis, that language determines thought, is also thought to be incorrect. ...<p>Among the most frequently cited examples of linguistic determinism is Whorf's study of the language of the Inuit people, who were thought to have numerous words for snow. He argues that this modifies the world view of the Eskimo, creating a different mode of existence for them than, for instance, a speaker of English. The notion that Arctic people have an unusually large number of words for snow has been shown to be false by linguist Geoffrey Pullum; in an essay titled ""The great Eskimo vocabulary hoax"", he tracks down the origin of the story, ultimately attributing it largely to Whorf and suggesting the triviality of Whorf's observations.<p>... A recent study by Peter Gordon examines the language of the Pirah tribe of Brazil. According to Gordon, the language used by this tribe only contains three counting words: one, two and many. Gordon shows through a series of experiments that the people of the Pirah tribe have difficulty recounting numbers higher than three (Gordon, 2004). However, the causal relationship of these events is not clear. Critics have argued that if the test subjects are unable to count numbers higher than three for some other reason (perhaps because they are nomadic hunter/gatherers with nothing to count and hence no need to practice doing so) then one should not expect their language to have words for such numbers. That is, it is the lack of need which explains both the lack of counting ability and the lack of corresponding vocabulary. Moreover, a more recent study suggests that the Pirah have a basic understanding of geometry despite their language.<p>- - - End Quote<p>[1] <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/supplement2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/supplement2.htm...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis</a>",1324401035

Some sites think things like white/yellow on #000000 is a good idea, and it's just a terrible readability disaster.  But the ""DarkSlateGray"" background of gnome2 is entirely different, IMHO.  Give it a shot for a few days and see what you think.",1324400494

How do we prevent that from ever happening again?\nMe: Don't let anyone do anything.\nBoss: No, I'm serious.\nMe: So am I.<p>So classic.  But it's true, you could try to work with the Boss a little more.  Maybe say, ""it's impossible to prevent that from <i>ever</i> happening again, but there might be some things we can do to reduce the frequency of that happening.""  Then you can talk about things like (assuming that if your boss it that bad that maybe these things aren't happening) code reviews, automated testing, etc.",1324400477

Even in a fully lit room (without reflections on the screens, etc), dark backgrounds are not as comfortable as light backgrounds.<p>[EDIT] TO clarify a bit more - I use 2x 24"" monitors at the recommended distance (arms length). This means that for better or worse, most of my field of view will be taken up by the monitors, and so most of the light that hits my eyes will always be from my monitors.",1324400462

Kickstarter has a good reputation in terms of the quality of the projects and this is mainly due to the review process. As you say, the downside is that some projects don't make it in spite of their potential.<p>The same is true for Apple's App Store. Their review process has received a lot of criticism, but the advantage of Apple's filtering process has proven itself when compared to the Android Marketplace.",1324400431

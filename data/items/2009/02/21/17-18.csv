489933,comment,489077,489077,0,0,DannoHung,,,"The only thing I worry about with git is getting really raw developers who have never, <i>ever</i> used version control up and running in a semblance of a reasonable manner of operation.<p>I mean, I know people who were resistant to using subversion because they didn't understand how it was supposed to work.  I sort of shudder to think about the mental reaction to being dropped into git. Because of this I originally supported Darcs.  I still would if they could clean up some of the patch resolution problems that they have and the Darcs GitHub-like got halfway decent (maybe with Camp).<p>Source Control is one of the fundamental tenets of development and getting newbs trained on it is so incredibly important.  We, collectively, can't afford for it to be a tough thing to get a handle on.  Even if it takes time to really understand, it needs to be easy to get going and using the tool in a good semblance of the proper manner.",1235238705

My conclusion after all of this is that the debate on OO is almost entirely obscured by noise, because only 10-20% of developers are capable of using it even remotely correctly in practice. Many of the people yelling about how horrible it is are not in that 10-20%, either, and nor are many of the people singing (or, at least, ""repeating"") its praises.<p>It may be sold as a technique that the masses can use, but this is demonstrably not true, if you examine the code the masses are producing.",1235238509
489929,comment,489896,489896,0,0,kubrick,,,"Two thoughts come to mind:<p>1) the VC system needs to be reformed. If founders are being screwed like this (and I think it's reasonable to say this is a screw), they're going to find other ways to raise capital. (And they are!) VCs should be in the business of cultivating founders, of encouraging and then rewarding them.<p>2) This is all the more reason to sell your company; it's more realistic (post-dot-com-bust) anyway, and obviously, it's the way to profit the most. Plenty of companies are buying these days. You just have to find a way to make something worth buying (and that's the rub, isn't it?).",1235238493

Just being qualified to be one part of this team puts you on an equal footing with founders in a startup after 4 rounds. Damn...<p>Who are these people?

This guy at least acknowledges that as a trap, but he doesn't convince me that he isn't falling into it.  Furthermore, if you read his other post that he links to, he pretty much admits that the things he blames on OOP are due to incompetent use of OOP:<p>""The thing that wasn't equal was the tendency of humans to fill a new development technique's capacity for scalability as long as that technique is used. As OOP provided greater ability to write ever-larger programs, humans wrote ever-larger programs — even when they didn't need to do so (and probably shouldn't have done so).""",1235236581

Git is probably <i>qualitatively</i> better for most competent developers, but for <i>strictly</i>, every feature counts -- git's support for handling binary files, in terms of size and content, is not as complete as svn's; and tree tracking is just completely different.<p>This means some developers will want things that svn can do but git can't.

No board or investor WANTS to go through the turmoil of replacing or fighting with the founders.

489911,comment,489827,489827,0,0,sdp,,,"<i>""OOP didn't do this to us; we did it to ourselves. OOP just held our hats.""</i><p>I support the article's claim that programmers are responsible for spaghetti code, but I disagree that OOP in general is responsible for facilitating this behavior.  Compare Java's OO to smalltalk's OO.<p>On the one hand, you have ""a halfway point between C++ and Lisp"" which inherits a bytecode on virtual machine implementation from lisp and most everything else from C++. [<a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg04045.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/m...</a>]<p>On the other hand you have an open source ecosystem built on top of a VM, where all code is available for modification and extension by the user. [<a href=""http://www.squeak.org/About/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.squeak.org/About/</a>]<p>Java programs are notorious for being resource hogs and unstable, and smalltalk programs are notorious for the opposite.<p>This dichotomy suggests OOP is not the evil villain it's made out to be.  Rather, I would suggest that the average quality of code produced in a particular language is proportional to how easy it is to read other people's code in that language.<p>Java makes it very easy to hide your code.  Often while working on a large Java project at school, each of my team mates and I divide the project into classes and we are each responsible for a particular set of classes.  We don't ever need to look at one another's code to complete the assignment, and thus bugs can creep in.<p>On the other hand, I work on a mid-size PHP code base which is my responsibility alone.  Thankfully, one of my co-workers is an excellent PHP coder.  Whenever I make revisions to the code, I ask him to review my code.  The mere knowledge that someone else is going to read the code I write is enough impetus for me to write better code in the hope that someday he won't find something I'll need to revise.<p>My experience is not an isolated case, as can be seen in this article by Jeff Atwood who quotes Code Complete: [<a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000495.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000495.html</a>].<p>This is supported by the generally higher quality of code in very shared languages like C, Smalltalk and Python, than in seldom shared languages like Java, C++ and Cobol.<p>Clearly, C has a high potential for code hiding, but a community of code sharing (Unix) was built around the language to address this issue.",1235235866

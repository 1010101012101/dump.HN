But let&#x27;s assume that he&#x27;s an efficient user of electricity, and uses 250 kWh/month for things aside from the car. He estimated 15k miles per year, at 3 miles/kWh, that&#x27;s 416 kWh per month, which works out to roughlly $65.50/month, or $785/year, not $600.<p>If we instead assume he&#x27;s an average user in a home that&#x27;s not &quot;efficient&quot;, it goes way up to roughly $92/month, or about $1100/year.<p>Obviously I don&#x27;t know this person&#x27;s exact rates for electricity, or his usage, and it may be the case that there are credits associated with having an electric car that can bring his average rates down or prevent him from going into the higher tiers (as he said, he could often charge for free at work), but regardless an estimate of $0.12/kWh seems strikingly low. I&#x27;m sure there are areas of the country where that&#x27;s reasonable, or even high, but I don&#x27;t think the Bay Area is one of them.<p>Of all the cost analyses of Tesla ownership that I&#x27;ve seen (admittedly few), I have yet to see one that attempts to take into account the higher marginal electricity cost associated with using significantly more electricity.",1397498132

7587691,comment,7585756,7586242,7,0,Ologn,,,"> I wonder if Google made a mistake by not choosing native code for Android apps. We have heard forever about Java (and other run-times) getting close to C in performance, but outside of specific test cases native code still runs circles around everything else out there.<p>You can use native code for Android apps.  I do.  In the NDK samples there is an app called NativeActivity which is 100% C/C++.  You compile an APK without writing any Java/Dalvik code.<p>From my anecdotal knowledge, most of the popular Android games are written mostly in C++, using the OpenGL ES library, and have a common code base with their iOS counterparts.  Maybe they are all native code, maybe they use some Java and JNI stuff, but they are mostly C++.  So Android is native on the game side, where it is needed.<p>A deep look at how all native code runs will show some non-native system code run when it launches, but that becomes pedantry if performance and not purity is the focus.<p>Android is cleft in two - applications are mostly Java/Dalvik with maybe some JNI access to C/C++ libraries, games from all my discussions with Android game developers are usually mostly the same C++ code and OpenGL ES they are using on iOS.<p>One example I know a little about is Jigzo.  It is an open source game which is C++ and uses OpenGL and SDL libraries.  The original developer ported it to iOS.  I ported it to Android.  Same basic code base, with a few tweaks for each OS.  I changed the name from Jigzo to Jigsaw Puzzles on Play though.",1397497988

There&#x27;s not much used inventory being sold and owners seem to love the Model S&#x27;s.<p>The other factor with resale is that the Model S is light years ahead of any other cars in terms of technology.  So, in 5 years the current center console of the Model S will still be far superior in terms of user experience than any other car in the market IMO.  This will help resale value.<p>Another point is that current users are experiencing very little degradation on their batteries, even after 20-30k miles of usage.  After 5 years/70k miles, the battery will probably still be at 95% capacity and this will help resale as well.<p>Also, with EVs in general you are buying not just the car but the battery.  Think of it as you&#x27;re buying your future gasoline with the car purchase (of course this isn&#x27;t a perfect analogy because you still need to pay for electricity), so that&#x27;s why EVs tend to have fairly good resale value.<p>Lastly, Tesla demonstrated a battery swap (in less than a few minutes) last year (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5V0vL3nnHY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5V0vL3nnHY</a>).

Most of the taxis there are &quot;limousine services&quot; that are allowed to answer hails on the street. I found the situation pretty annoying, because rates are negotiated up front and are always more than what a metered taxi would cost. Many cities prohibit this because taxi drivers routinely use it to scam tourists (hence why taxi regulation exists.)

Every company is different and even using the same tools, can have completely different workflows. Some are mildly efficient, some are a total clusterfuck and some are just baffling that anything gets done. I have never seen a company operate with a flawless workflow. Ever. The bigger the organization, the more product managers you add, people stay equally confused. There&#x27;s no magic spell to be organized, you just have to accept that there will always be a certain level of chaos in any given system and learn to mitigate it as best you can with regular communication.<p>Basically the lesson I&#x27;ve learned is find a tool that&#x27;s <i>simple</i> - as simple as the size of your team or organization can stomach - and only level up when you grow in scale. Heck, a spreadsheet full of tasks can be a surprisingly effective task management system for most small groups.

That&#x27;s like 2-5hrs.<p>As for going to non-dealer mechanic, well it is hard to find a good mechanic you can really trust. And such mechanics are usually booked.<p>On my very 1st car last oil change, I got an oil change at a shop I hadn&#x27;t gone to before, for lack of time.

Nobody is getting as much work done as they would like, and they never will.

If the project in question is truly a side project and truly unrelated then the manager&#x27;s best course is obviously a held tongue. But it if is potentially competitive?

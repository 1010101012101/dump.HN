226562,comment,226352,226352,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I see the traditional record company being replaced by two sets of firms: 1) Online commission-based digital distribution firms and 2) Firms that handle tours, preferably also commission-based.<p>1) hasn't been done well yet. I know Amazon lets bands list and sell MP3s, and amiestreet.com offers music from indie artists with a funky pricing model. However, there's not really a ""go-to"" place right now with a large amount of traffic from people looking for independent music. Amazon is dominated by the majors, and no other site is very popular.<p>There are a number of popular places for a band to distribute their music for free, such as Myspace, but these places don't provide their bands with a revenue source. I can understand how bands would like to get paid if people love their music.<p>Some bands have resorted to selling their music themselves straight from their website (NIN, Radiohead, Girl Talk, etc.). However, it ought to be possible to automate this process to allow bands without technical skill to list and sell their own music (maybe make an embeddable music store?). Also, a central site off the band page could allow less popular bands to get some exposure.<p>Does 2) exist? I don't know. I have heard of some firms that manage tours for famous independent bands, the kind that have been around forever and have fulfilled their initial sodomizing major label deals. I don't know if any exists for mid-level bands.<p>One thing is for sure - the record companies are dinosaurs. They are glorified middle-men who connect bands with CD printing and distribution firms. Digital distribution means that they no longer serve a function, outside of marketing. That's the one downfall of online distribution - there are millions of bands on the internet and it is hard for fans to find new stuff they like.<p>There's been a number of startups that have tried to help people find new music, from the big guys like Pandora (dominated by majors), to new little guys like thefeelgood.com. I don't think anybody's gotten it right yet, and none of them mix the marketing with the monetizing well.<p>Honestly, if Myspace let bands sell MP3s on their profile page, it would probably be good enough and 10x better than anything currently out there.<p>So, what do you say Hacker News? Is anybody out there working on burying the record companies? What are your ideas, and how are you doing?<p>Anybody live in San Diego and want to do it with me?",1214330293

It's really awesome and I'm already trying to sell my Garmin Nuvi to switch to the Dash.<p>As for your complaints:<p>Social network for the highways is reporter-speak. What the Dash does is it consolidates traffic data from all the users, analyze it, and then pushes back to the users. So if car A slows down or stops because he encounters a traffic jam that data is sent out to other cars behind car A to inform them of such a problem. It then redirects them to another route as a means of saving you time. If you don't think that's freakin' awesome, well then I don't know, you must live on the moon.<p>Also hardware companies have a considerably higher overhead than web 2.0 companies considering the amount of R&D and manufacturing costs associated with releasing a, you know, actual product.",1214330175
226559,comment,226385,226385,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"Oooh, good question. I certainly don't have a definitive answer. My current preference is to have a few atomic composable methods in a vocabulary. If I find myself using a specific compositional idiom enough that it needs its own name, I create a new method and factor out that idiom. I use this strategy when writing libraries for my own use.<p>When distributing to others there are more concerns in play. In a language like Java where 3rd party libraries are frozen from the perspective of the developer a rich vocabulary is a helpful thing. In Ruby, open classes make it much easier for the developer to add things on their own. Lua aspires to minimalism; its standard libary is <i>very</i> small and atomic. Lisp is a very compositional language so I would lean towards exposing only the key concepts of a library. These are all valid approaches in their spheres.",1214330147

I'd focus on making the information people want jump out at them as much as possible. You're filling up a lot of space at the top. Try putting some of that at the bottom.

All the good candidates will form startups and get on with it and no longer have a need (or the time) for such a community.<p>As for a good way of finding cofounders, I can't really answer that from experience. I've done a poor job of doing that myself having not found any, but I'd rather go it alone than just team up with someone I've randomly found on the internet.<p>If you've got a bunch of friends who are kind of on the fence about the whole thing, either because they don't like your idea (big red flag!) or because they're not sure they want to commit to doing a startup, I recommend talking to them and forcing them to be honest with you about your idea and their plans. You could see if they'll join you after you've built some kind of proof-of-concept/prototype on your own, although I recommend you plan for the case where they never follow through with it.<p>If your friends just plain don't want to do the whole startup thing (that would account for 100% of my hacker friends) and you decide to go it alone, try and keep a few of them in the loop of what you're doing as much as possible. They won't replace a good cofounder, but better than nothing and will keep you grounded.<p>By the way, 'friend' here refers to people you have a lot of trust in, as opposed to 'acquaintances'.",1214329526

Your original example of getting out when a stock drops a dollar is not a good one. If a stock you bought at 40 goes to 30, would you get out, or add more? What about 20? 5? You need to have a plan.

226485,comment,226209,226405,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"1) No. Again, why should you have an automatic system for panicking when other people panic? If your ideal is really to be average, but slow, how will you ever succeed?<p>2) Why 8%? Why not for low-price stocks? What about for stocks traded overseas (5 Yen? 500 Yen?)? It all sounds very unscientific -- and I've read O'Neil's books.<p>3) I didn't say that this involved selling then. That call caused the stock to drop in my example. Then the drop caused the stop-loss sale.<p>4) Average in before or after getting stopped out?<p>5) Why are you viewing the price quote isolated from the business value? If the stock is up 100% because the company is worth more, selling is not that wise. If the company triples in value (e.g. a new patent, a competitor going under), the 100% rise in price is not a good excuse to sell.<p>6) Value investing is when you try to buy something for less than it's worth. Usually, a strategy of paying 110 cents on the dollar can't get by with the claim that it's just another ""strategy"", even if the plan is to flip it to someone else for 120 cents on the dollar. When you rely on an infinite supply of subsequent suckers, it's very probable that you will some day be the last sucker.<p>7) ""Buy and hold"" doesn't mean ""Buy and hold forever."" It means that your bias should be towards sticking with a few good investments, rather than playing lots of markets. In general, if A's strategy calls for one good idea a year and B's strategy calls for ten good ideas a month, A will have devoted 100X as much effort to his average idea (and will be paying much lower taxes!).<p>8) So? When you purchase shares of many businesses at once, instead of one, are you exempt from behaving in a businesslike manner?",1214327585

226472,comment,226385,226385,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I'd probabl have to argue in favor of writing convenience methods to make a usable api right off the bat. For example, I don't necessarily NEED the strlen method, since I can make my own with little trouble, but it is sure nice to have. I'd say the more public methods there are in one's API the better. This way in the java world, you can have a public interface with all the methods a client developer could ever want, but protect (hide) the implementation of these methods. Without a good set of available public api methods, you a) inconvenience the target developer and b) make it impossible to hide the implementation, since to do anything useful with the application, the developer would need to know the ""guts"" of it, since the public api isn't good. So yes, probably this is a matter of taste, but in the spirit of ""do unto others"", personally I like having ""conveniences"" like the strlen example, and so I like to make similar ""conveinces"" when I'm writing code myself.",1214327205

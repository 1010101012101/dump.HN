A big effort, but probably just on the scale of WP7 or iOS.  This gives you a good high-level shell experience for doing things like finding files, launching apps, etc....<p>2) Make a great touch screen keyboard.  Probably make a handful of them, so the user can try various kinds and make the default the one they like the most.  Note, Windows handwriting recognition is already quite good.<p>3) Add a touch-friendly shell on IE9.  The shell is already minimalist -- this is pretty incremental work.<p>4) Make touch-friendly versions of all the built-in Windows apps (notepad, wmp, control panel, etc...).  This maybe a large work item, so use telemetry data to hit the 20 most popular apps first.<p>5) Make Office touch friendly.  It's actually surprisingly touch friendly now.<p>6) Get the top 100 apps and work with vendors on making them finger-friendly.  Entice with money where necessary.  Targets here would be Chrome, Firefox, Photoshop, iTunes, Zune, VLC, WinZip, Quicktime, TurboTax, Adobe Reader, Mathematica, etc...  I suspect the conversion ratio won't be super high, but you'll move what you can.<p>7) Create a touch app store.<p>Now this won't be perfect, but I suspect it will be a pretty tremendous start, coupled with OakTrail.  This probably would seriously cannibalize the netbook market.  I'd probably even get one.",1289858383

1908037,comment,1907756,1907756,0,0,davcro,,,"I can't imagine life without RDS.  I'm a solo developer responsible for a large web app.  Before RDS I hosted MySQL on dedicated hardware from Softlayer.  I had a dedicated box for the master, one for the slave, and another for storing backups.  The DB was about 100GB which made backing up a total nightmare.  Mysqldump was too slow, I ended up having to use xtrabackup from Percona.  Anyhow it got to the point were I was spending over 50% of my time maintaining the database instead of doing productive things, like building new features for my app.<p>Then I switched to RDS.  I instantly fell in love with snapshots.  I love that you can backup your database while it is hot.  Sometimes, before doing a scary migration or query I'll take a snapshot just in case.  I love that.<p>Even more amazing is the ability to scale up/down while the database is live.  When I was with Softlayer and I needed to migrate to new machines there was always downtime and I always had to pay for both the new machine and the old machine for a small duration of time.  Thus migrating would cost a couple grand in lost revenue and servers expenses, not to mention my Friday and Saturday night.",1289858246

Unless it is a company offering cool new tech and/or directly targeted at hackers, I don't think I can think of even one large company that owes its success largely due to hacker/nerds as early adopters. Hackers tend to be extremely practical individuals, and in their pursuit to practical perfection, they often forget to realize that there are people out there who value practicality lower than many other factors (eg. aesthetics, social validation). I bet most hackers won't care much for Facebook's new release (""they just reinvented email folders -- really?""), but I'm sure the majority of Facebook's power-users will love it. Similarly, many hackers don't get the appeal of Apple's products as they believe they're sacrificing function for form, but Apple seems to be doing alright. Lots of opportunities arise when you realize that the majority of consumers out there are actually looking to gain a lot more  than just practicality, even if that may come at a practical cost.

The non-recoverability of hashes comes into play when you consider that people reuse passwords on other sites, so if you could reverse all the password hashes for one site, it's conceivable that you could get into the users' accounts on another site.  But if you're not recovering the original string, the chance of the password hashing the same way on another site is slim.

I'm not sure how we ended up with such a terrible tool.<p>There are times when I have spent 10 hours trying to do some trivial bit of layout done with CSS, and finally resorting to a little table got it done instantly.<p>There are entire classes of things that you can't do with CSS, or you have to resort to bizarre hacks to get done (negative padding, etc).<p>I'm not claiming that tables solve every problem, but presented with the choice of spending hours figuring out some css hack and testing it in the dozens of browsers / mobile browsers that are out there now, and just making a table, I will just make the table and move on.<p>Edit: You should use CSS 90% of the time.  Tables often let you do something easily that CSS has lots of trouble with, and I recommend resorting to them at that point.",1289855210

The current approved attitude among designers is that HTML tables are evil, so by agreeing you gain social standing.  If you adopt the technically arguable but socially inappropriate stance that there's a time and place for tables, you'll be treated similarly to a C programmer who defends 'goto': at best a relic, at worst a moron.<p>Nod and smile, then get back to work.  Improve your toolset by learning how it's done in Haskell (Erlang, Lua, R, other up and coming language) on the side, but don't be worried about using the language you know to get the job done.  Understand the potential advantages of CSS, but don't worry too much about a perfectly workable solution. Just realize that you'll be mocked for it in certain circles.

The whole notion of cliff vesting never made sense to me, and the OP doesn't really explain it.<p><i>The reason for the one year cliff is to protect the company and its shareholders (including the employees) from a bad hire which gets a huge grant of stock or options but proves to be a mistake right away.<p>One year doesn't at all strike me as ""right away.""

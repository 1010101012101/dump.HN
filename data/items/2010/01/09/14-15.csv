1041503,comment,1040720,1040969,0,0,Retric,,,"Sorry about the ambiguous <i>that</i>, I was talking about the idea of systematic leap years not our calendar system.  It was my understanding that during this time period the calendar was still being reset based the vernal equinox and a hard and fast rule had yet to be added.  Otherwise there would have been no need to adopt the Julian calendar in the first place.<p><i>According to the later writers Censorinus and Macrobius, the ideal intercalary cycle consisted of ordinary years of 355 days alternating with intercalary years, alternately 377 and 378 days long. On this system, the average Roman year would have had 366¼ days over four years, giving it an average drift of one day per year relative to any solstice or equinox. Macrobius describes a further refinement wherein, for 8 years out of 24, there were only three intercalary years, each of 377 days. This refinement averages the length of the year to 365¼ days over 24 years. In practice, intercalations did not occur schematically according to these ideal systems, but were determined by the pontifices. So far as can be determined from the historical evidence, they were much less regular than these ideal schemes suggest. They usually occurred every second or third year, but were sometimes omitted for much longer, and occasionally occurred in two consecutive years.</i>  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar</a>",1263048731

1041481,comment,1039896,1041214,0,0,anonjon,,,"Right, that is the reason that there is such a huge difference between the runtime for eval between the languages. Macros do slow down eval if you are doing macro-expansion. They are complicated enough that normally you do not write (or expect) them to expand quickly. This is obvious because macros and fexprs are much different. Overall, macros can speed up your program because you are allowed to do certain calculations ahead of time, if you are clever about it.<p>I am not saying that you should avoid eval completely, I am just saying that it shouldn't be your only tool. And when you do use it, if you put it in a tight loop, you are probably doing something wrong.<p>The main alternative that comes to mind for me is function passing. There is a lot that you can do with function passing that overlaps with eval, except the function passing version will be safer and faster.<p>We agree that is one of the most powerful, most fun aspects of using lisp (the power is what makes it fun!). I also hope we agree that the frequency of its use should be the inverse of its power.",1263047453

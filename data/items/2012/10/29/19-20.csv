With my 3G connection I can watch Youtube videos just fine. But it really does work at around ~ 20 Mbps (HSPA+), which is like ~ 2 MB/s, so if I'm not careful, I can burn thorough my 5 GB plan in a couple of hours. And from personal experience, few people have more than 5 GB of monthly bandwidth.<p>At home I have Wifi, at work I have Wifi, all the coffee-shops I go to have free Wifis for clients, most hotels have Wifis too. The only instances where I use my 3G connection is when I commute between places or if I end-up with a shitty Wifi connection and in such instances I just browse the web casually, or read email, or read Twitter/Facebook updates. Which is what most people do.<p>The only heavy-usage of my 3G connection has been for Skype. But Skype works surprisingly well for me over 3G (YMMV of course).",1351540665

More clicks or conversions is quite likely good, but over the long-term you want to track LTV.

Some counties are higher, some lower.<p>The pension plans are problematic, because many of them are under funded. For an older teacher about to retire this might not be an issue, but if you're 30 this seems like a much less certain deal.<p>Teachers are rarely compensated on an hourly basis, and when they are it probably doesn't count half of their hours.<p>Would your attorney charge you (in 5 minute increments) for a call at 7pm? You bet they would! But a call with a parent at 7pm nets a teacher nothing. Nor does preparation in the evening. Many teachers have exceedingly low classroom budgets as well, and are often forced to purchase supplies out of pocket.<p>The High School theatre teacher who is working on a play with students until 11pm every night for weeks and weekends isn't compensated on an hourly basis; or given overtime. Its just part of the gig. And that sucks.<p>I wouldn't mind being a teacher some day, as I love teaching; but unless I hit the startup lottery there's no way i can accept that level of compensation given my background, experience and skills.

Usually the term for it now days is college degree or equivalent experience...<p>Side note I dropped out my senior year of college because I got tired of paying out of state tuition for what I finally saw as something useless to my computer science education. I've not regretted this decision and the experience I've gained in the field previous/in college working a normal programming job put me years ahead of any peers who graduated at the same time I dropped out.<p>I hate advising people to dropout or quit anything but when it comes to computer science, go start an open source project, use one of the many wonderful online learn to program resources or just hack away on a Linux machine setting up a few server services and you'll learn more real world usable computer science in a few days of doing that then you will in a year of college.<p>EDIT: What I wish I would have done was went in-state and got a degree in the arts or English or straight up math. The classes I took in regard to these subjects are useful to me on a daily basis.

A few things that come to mind off the top of my head:<p>-Again, the documentation isn't well-written. It almost all feels like it's written either by an engineer with little writing experience or a technical writer without engineering experience. There have been times when I've had to re-read passages over and over again because I genuinely couldn't parse what they were trying to say.<p>-The insistence on weak typing everywhere is insane. Intents are sloppy, weakly-typed junk; Messages ditto. The R auto-generated class isn't bright either--even if you need an integer index, at least wrap it in a type-safe class to eliminate the possibility of passing the wrong thing around. I really do genuinely like working in Java, but I like working in <i>well-designed</i> Java. This is the same company that made Guava, which is perhaps the most elegantly designed API I know of in Java-land. But many of Android's APIs treat classes as an incidental hindrance.<p>-Dalvik blows. There is nothing good about it and there's so much that's bad about it. The class limit is crippling, and the lack of hot-loading is prohibitive. (I write games in my spare time, I'd love to be able to use Groovy as a scripting layer, but that's not going to happen.)<p>-This might sound crazy, but XML is a machine-readable format. People know that, right? Okay, great. So why are the tools for building layouts so much junk?<p>Not on this list is <i>fragmentation</i>, because I don't find that to be a real problem for my purposes. My app for work is 4.0+ only, and I test on a Galaxy Nexus; if it works there it'll work on a SIII or an Atrix HD or whatever else somebody wants to try. (We're outsourcing wide device testing to uTest, but our app isn't done so I haven't had the opportunity to try their services.)",1351538325

There are plenty of games that run on Linux (hardly as many on windows, but you can easily say the drivers are ""there"").<p>>Just because Windows has the ""majority of the desktop base"" doesn't mean it has to be the premiere gaming platform. Gamers are a very select group of people, and there's no reason Valve couldn't target them.<p>Disagree. Look at the Mac - decent support, decent performance, it has AAA titles on it that are also on other platforms, yet you won't ever see AAA exclusive titles being released on the mac. And why would you? Think like a publisher - you're artificially limiting your audience. The number of people who will jump platforms (or even maintain two platforms) just for your title is infinitesimal. Until such time as that happens, the mac is an also-ran. Same for Linux - and Linux has a huge advantage over Mac in that there's zero cost barrier.",1351537633

4713898,comment,4713698,4713698,6,0,reaperhulk,,,"It's nice that they've enabled this on their servers, but it comes with some caveats at the moment.<p>First, not all browsers support it. For example, no version of Firefox supports it at this time (see: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=360420"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=360420</a>).<p>Second, OCSP stapling was originally conceived for only the end entity cert. This means that if the browser wants to check intermediates for revocation that payload can't be stapled, but will still require an additional check. There are several in progress proposals (spearheaded by Opera) to resolve this, but it's not finalized yet. This negates some of the speed gain on browsers that do choose to do revocation checking with this level of rigor.<p>But guess what, you can join the stapling party even if you aren't a CloudFlare customer!  If you're using Apache (2.3+) you can configure OCSP stapling for your own website with the SSLUseStapling directive. nginx also plans to support stapling with the 1.3 release (initial preview released early this month). You can also do stapling with IIS 7.5+ on Windows.<p>Edit: Others have asked what browsers currently support stapling. I believe only Opera and IE9+ (probably schannel in Win7, but possibly in Vista?) at this time. Chrome is publicly moving away from OCSP/CRL entirely in favor of aggregating that data themselves and pushing it down to clients via their own infrastructure, Firefox has that open bug, and Apple's roadmap for ocspd/securityd is obviously not known.",1351537603

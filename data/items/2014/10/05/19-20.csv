Better yet, force everyone to make every information public.<p>But most likely, all this data would be of great interest for criminals? What about the cost of fraud, crime, identity theft? Is it better to have unencrypted phones stolen by criminals in exchange for easier and cheaper surveillance?<p>I&#x27;d think Apples encryption isn&#x27;t mostly targeted to stop law enforcement and surveillance but more to stop misuse of lost and stolen phones. In addition, if able to implant zero-day exploits, any attacker can bypath any encryption - or he might just target the transmission or the other side of a sent/received secret. Most information isn&#x27;t produced on an iPhone to sit there forever: either it is received from a server / second device or it is intended to be transmitted to a receiver.

Most governments opposed internet technology, backing instead nascent ISO networking standards. CERN’s decision to migrate to internet was heavily criticized by TCP/IP opponents.<p>In Geneva, the very first meeting of the Coordinating Committee for Intercontinental Research Network (CCIRN) was in May 1988. This committee was the first attempt to harmonize the inter-regional operation of the emerging world-wide research network.<p>The second meeting took place in October 1988 at a summer resort in Western Virginia, sad and grey this particular autumn. The Americans turned up in force. Bill Bostwick, from the Department of Energy was the Chairman, Barry Leiner from the Department of Defense and Vint Cerf were present. The European representatives were thin on the ground: a German and British representative plus Francois Flückiger.<p>In 1991, 80% of the internet capacity in Europe for international traffic was installed at CERN, in building 513.<p>From 1985 to 1988, as CERN&#x27;s first official &quot;TCP/IP Co-ordinator&quot;, Segal was responsible for coordinating the introduction of the Internet protocols within CERN.<p>This router was one of two installed at CERN in 1987; they are thought to have been the first Cisco routers in Switzerland and possibly the first in Europe.\nWe begin therefore where they are determined not to end, with the question whether any form of democratic self-government, anywhere, is consistent with the kind of massive, pervasive, surveillance into which the Unites States government has led not only us but the world.<p>This should not actually be a complicated inquiry.<p>The numbers make the problem clear. In 2007, the year before CERN first powered up the LHC, the lab produced 142 master&#x27;s and Ph.D. theses, according to the lab&#x27;s document server. Last year it produced 327. (Fermilab chipped in 54.) That abundance seems unlikely to vanish anytime soon, as last year ATLAS had 1000 grad students and CMS had 900.<p>In contrast, the INSPIRE Web site, a database for particle physics, currently lists 124 postdocs worldwide in experimental high-energy physics, the sort of work LHC grads have trained for.<p>The situation is equally difficult for postdocs trying to make the jump to a junior faculty position or a permanent job at a national lab. The Snowmass Young Physicists survey received responses from 956 early-career researchers, including 343 postdocs. But INSPIRE currently lists just 152 &quot;junior&quot; positions, including 61 in North America. And the supply of jobs isn&#x27;t likely to increase, says John Finley, an astrophysicist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who is leading a search to replace two senior particle physicists.<p>&quot;How should we make it attractive for them [young people] to spend 5,6,7 years in our field, be satisfied, learn about excitement, but finally be qualified to find other possibilities?&quot; -- H. Schopper<p>Indeed, even while giving complete satisfaction, they have no forward vision about the possibility of pursuing a career at CERN.<p>This lack of an element of social responsibility in the contract policy is unacceptable. Rather than serve as a cushion of laziness for supervisors, who often have only a limited and utilitarian view when defining the opening of an IC post, the contract policy must ensure the inclusion of an element of social justice, which is cruelly absent today.<p><a href=""http://staff-association.web.cern.ch/content/unsatisfactory-contract-policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staff-association.web.cern.ch/content/unsatisfactory-...</a><p>Potential missing staff in some areas is a separate issue, and educational programmes are not designed to make up for it.

8413201,comment,8412679,8412896,1,0,lhl,,,"Personally, I think there&#x27;s still more (potentially much more) downside in the short-term, but it&#x27;s hard to catch a falling knife. As an investment vehicle, it&#x27;s highly speculative and there&#x27;s still a many existential threats that could cause Bitcoin value could completely collapse (something is fundamentally broken with the protocol that can&#x27;t be rolled back/forked/or patched, instability/attacks on the mining network that make mining untenable, aggressive governmental illegalization/prosecution of crypto-currencies).<p>However, I&#x27;m pretty bullish about Bitcoin mid-term, and here&#x27;s why:<p>* The blockchain is pretty revolutionary technology that allows transactions between untrusted decentralized parties. There&#x27;s almost no end of interesting decentralized architecture/applications that can be built on it. Blockchains are secured by computation - the Bitcoin network is by far (magnitudes) the most secure network and security (mining difficulty/hashrate) continues to grow[1]. While there are some interesting altcoins being developed (Ethereum is probably the most promising), it seems like Bitcoin will be the best blockchain to use if you have something you want to build anytime soon. There&#x27;s a lot of interesting developments (side chains, tree chains, etc that will let devs use the network more easily)<p>* Even comparing to a year ago, the amount of infrastructure: exchanges, wallets, storage, payment processors, ATMs, being built has been staggering. I think w/ the way Coinbase, BitPay, and Circle are working we&#x27;re just getting to a point where a regular consumer might even consider using the Bitcoin (think the net in &#x27;94/&#x27;95). There&#x27;s still a lot of basic infrastructural improvements that need to happen.<p>* Along with that, I think that cdixon&#x27;s post on &quot;native Bitcoin apps&quot;[2] is right on. International microfinance (as an extension/evolution of international remittance) and decentralized marketplaces can be do things that have traditionally been too hard/expensive to be worthwhile (again, the parallels to the story of the Internet). These are billion dollar opportunities.<p>* To some degree, this shuffle of weak hands/speculators/early adopters cashing out is probably a better thing in the long term. You&#x27;re seeing some big players doing some major market manipulation (this drop was primarily driven by a 30K BTC sell wall) - still, overall volatility continues to decline[3] and Bitcoin&#x27;s suitability as a transactional instrument is improving. Personally, I consider the early-adopter/&quot;dark matter&quot; coins as one of the most problematic aspects (and existential threats) to Bitcoin. Last year, Risto Pietilä ran some analysis on the leaked Gox data and extrapolated estimates that basically 1-10K people own 50% of all Bitcoins. The day that Satoshi&#x27;s coins start moving and the sky doesn&#x27;t fall I&#x27;ll feel better, but there are enough of these dark matter coins that Bitcoin may never get out from under the threat of extreme manipulation. Once crypto-currency infrastructure gets hammered out, I think there will probably be a mass migration to something that doesn&#x27;t end up making a handful of crazy people trillionaires, but maybe people won&#x27;t care (or prices become irrelevant as BTC is used primarily as a payment rail/tx processor; the floor will be based on money velocity and mining cost). I continue to be surprised as I&#x27;ve started following Bitcoin more closely.<p>So, you probably don&#x27;t want to put your life savings in, but it&#x27;s probably worth investing some time at least to pay attention to what&#x27;s popping out of the crypto-currency world.<p>[1] <a href=""https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cdixon.org/2014/10/04/some-ideas-for-native-bitcoin-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdixon.org/2014/10/04/some-ideas-for-native-bitcoin-a...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://btcvol.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://btcvol.info/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=316297.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=316297.0</a>",1412537763

And, indeed, the paper cited on a cryptosystem in GSM 3G being weak enough to pull data off the air does not say that at all: it simply weakens the cipher, but the conclusion of that paper itself says that the attack may not be viable for current networks.<p>The author&#x27;s view of how the UID works in the Secure Enclave is weak at best, as well.  The article that the author cites the possibility of the &quot;Secure Enclave code being able to read the UID key&quot;; as comex mentioned yesterday [1], this isn&#x27;t true.  (I know also that other SoCs work the same way that comex mentions; this is a common pattern.)  The author then goes on to discuss what could be done even if the key bits were extracted from fuses (an attack that I agree is possible); he claims a cycle time of 800 per iteration if executed on a CPU, but in reality, the encryption is done on a dedicated AES engine; I believe a cycle time closer to 4 per iteration is more likely, giving timescale estimates over 2 orders of magnitude worse than the author suspects.<p>It&#x27;s not all bad, though.  The author makes at least one <i>very</i> good point: 0day on the device, while it is powered on, could be enough to simply run the entire device through the onboard crypto.  The exploit doesn&#x27;t need to be complicated enough to modify the system software permanently -- as long as it can be used once, that&#x27;s good enough.<p>I think the crux of the matter is that this crypto scheme is not <i>designed</i> to stop the NSA, anyway: it&#x27;s designed to stop comex and to stop the local police.

Duh- It was based on the current returns that were allowable under state law, and I used the PA numbers—as told by the state-based Bell of PA (now Verizon PA) SEC filings.<p>The changes in state law happened in every state (though with varying commitments) – such as Verizon states -- PA, NJ, MA, and other states, IL, OH, etc. -- and they were ALL  based on direct commitments to rewire parts, if not the entire states as well as schools, depending on the state.<p>In PA, the original commitment were 100% completed by 2015, (though the commitments were changed over time.) in NJ it is 100% completed by 2010—with fiber 45 Mbps in both directions.<p>In PA we filed a complaint which said – state laws were changed specifically based on the commitments to upgrade the state utility plant, which was copper, with fiber. It removed the old ‘rate of return’ for new ‘alternative regulation’,  that speeded up the write offs of the networks, and no longer examined the profits of a state utility – which had a monopoly on that wire—with the goal to use this extra money for the deployment plan called Opportunity PA.<p>The profits overall, went from 12%-14%, which was standard in almost every Bell state to about 30% after the new law took effect.  In PA it went from 13% then jumped to 30% by 1998. -- But they didn’t deploy the fiber – nor replace the wire. And these numbers were in the SEC-annual reports.<p>You didn’t bother noting the chart on page 23 outlining the extra profits—directly tied to deploy fiber optics.<p>And PA and NJ had a timeline of deployment to upgrade to fiber and 45 Mbps—and it didn’t happen.  An analyst we quote said:<p>“As we approach the end of 1998 a point by which BA-PA is supposed to have broadband available throughout 20% of its rural, urban and suburban areas there is no sign of any broadband service being offered to Pennsylvania&#x27;s residential customers.&quot;<p>And the PA state commission wrote:<p>“When the Commission accepted Bell&#x27;s proposal, that proposal became binding on the Company. Any modifications or deviations from a 45 Mbps two way interactive network must be approved by this agency, since such would constitute a modification to the June 28, 1994 Opinion and Order which ruled on the Company&#x27;s original Petition and Plan.”<p>You write: \n>In other words, the accelerated depreciation was to compensate for the fact that once >regulated prices were gone, the telephone plant would become less valuable. It was not >predicated on replacing that plant with fiber.<p>Wrong… it was to replace the copper wires in the state utility. You obviously didn’t read the documents.  This is the language in the New Jersey Bell (Verizon NJ) annual report, 1994, for a $1.013 billion deduction – for the “company’s technology deployment plan” — It was a one-time deduction which every phone company took, called FAS 71, and it says:<p>&quot;The Company&#x27;s determination that it was no longer eligible for continued application of the accounting required by Statement No. 71. It was based on the belief that the convergence of competition, technological change (including the Company&#x27;s technology deployment plans).<p>And the result is a tax savings of about ½ billion dollars in NJ —from this one change.<p>And this is on top of ‘accelerated’ depreciation, which was also set by the state commissions to help speed up the deployment to fiber optics—which didn’t show from 1993-2005. – i.e., the company gets more tax deductions per year and didn’t replace the copper.<p>We documented this in our first book, 1999, Foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe, (co-inventor of Ethernet) who went through all the stats. And it was ALL for the commitment to replace the copper wires with fiber.<p>By around 2009- in NJ we calculated that Verizon NJ collected about 15 billion.<p>And you’re apologist for the companies deceiving the public and the state commissions and getting billions extra in tax perks and excess profits – which are monies that directly impact customers’ bottom line.<p>Law changed – extra money garnered – nothing built, (1993-2005) but to you that’s just fine.<p>And this PA stuff is from 2002-2003, before we uncovered the entire story about Verizon and AT&T financial manipulations—and it was low number.<p>Anyone interested in knowing the real history about broadband and fiber should do the fact checking themselves – the new book has detailed footnotes and links.",1412536927

I doubt there is anyone who can stop the NSA from executing a targeted attack that breaches that information.<p>My feeling is that <i>good</i> security measures increase the marginal cost per person surveilled. As the article points out, there are some kinds of communications that Apple is obliged to provide access to. Those are likely to carry low marginal costs per person surveilled, as law enforcement may have the legal means to directly and unilaterally access that information. Even if they don&#x27;t, the capacity for Apple, telecoms, whoever, to operate in &quot;God mode&quot; with respect to some kinds of communications means that mechanism is a good target for agencies like the NSA to breach.<p>By contrast, even flawed technologies like iMessage (centralized key management) raise the per-person marginal cost by forcing attacks to be reasonably targeted. While the NSA could probably figure out how to attack Apple&#x27;s key management infrastructure to set themselves up with a virtual iMessage device for an individual, doing so for <i>all</i> the people would, in principle, be fairly noticeable to Apple.<p>The more we can instrument technologies that force attacks from &quot;bulk mode&quot; to &quot;targeted,&quot; the better chance we have at actually curbing surveillance. Of course, this still leaves the panopticon problem--if we accept that targeted attacks will always be possible, and that any of us <i>could</i> be watched at roughly any time, the psychological chilling effects of surveillance remain.",1412536447

They don&#x27;t design processors and sell them like Qualcomm; they just do whatever is necessary for their product line.<p>A conglomerate like HP and Samsung often has little to no cross-pollination between divisions. Obviously the semiconductor part of Samsung can benefit the whole business, but the intersection between TV and dishwasher is probably zero, even at marketing level (they have totally different marketing and sales departments).",1412535939

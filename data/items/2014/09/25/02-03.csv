8365317,comment,8365129,8365291,4,0,joshAg,,,"I assume you&#x27;re talking about the subprime home mortgage debacle? Because the issue wasn&#x27;t that the loans were subprime, so much as it was the massive amounts of institutional fraud across many layers of the mortgage business that enabled unqualified people to get loans (or loans larger than they qualified for). IOW, subprime loans were the murder weapon, not the murderer.<p>EDIT: BTW, a subprime loan is just a loan that comes with terms that aren&#x27;t as good as they could be due to the applicant having some sort of issue in their application (eg, no credit history, a bankruptcy, lots of missed payments, no collateral, lots of other debt, etc.).",1411613343

8365315,comment,8364772,8365240,4,0,tomw1808,,,"I recently saw a colleague with a surface pro (version 1) as a workstation, I was rubbing my eyes, because I couldn&#x27;t believe that this is working.<p>That said, I&#x27;m now working (as a programmer, yes) from a Sony Vaio Multi-Flip 13&quot;. It has everything I ever wanted: Good resultion, sleek, quite remarkable performance for that tiny little thing, convertible, etc etc. It also &quot;look good&quot;, as the apple devices do, and, in addition, you can flip it over to a tablet. Well... in theory the best thing that I ever had. In theory. The closing mechanism sometimes doesn&#x27;t recognize a &quot;is closed&quot; properly and the notebook shuts down and comes up again in camera mode. I recently had to replace the keyboard, because the return key was broken, which is not easy with an ultrabook when warranty is over, since its soldered or brazed (or how you call that) with plastic pins. When I got it, I <i>think</i> I got a refurbished device, one key was stuck, and circumstances required that I open it myself and fix it and found the inside overwhelmingly full of fingerprints and screws in wrong places. I could continue like that and I am not alone. All these things, these little quality and qc glitches between an Apple device and &quot;all the others&quot; are (for me) the main reason why everyone runs to apple. They are producing just the best quality and for me as a consumer, its still affordable, and it even looks better and feels better. I am no friend of iOS, I grew up with windows and linux, which is no excuse not to buy an Apple, but I would still first look everywhere else for alternatives. So, that samsung is also shutting down is very sad, since they produces very nice models. A friend of mine has the older samsung series and has also quality glitches. Beside apple, it seems the market has realized it has to produce good quality, good looking and good functioning devices, but most of them are all show and no substance. For my understanding.<p>I was hoping they would slowly slowly introduce newer models, better processing, better overall quality. Instead they are shutting down. I&#x27;m sad.",1411613300

8365295,comment,8363527,8365046,1,0,antognini,,,"No, any photons that are emitted from matter close to the event horizon and travel <i>toward</i> the distant observer will be redshifted.  Photons falling into the potential well of the black hole will be blueshifted.  Of course, the distant observer is not able to directly detect photons falling into the black hole because he is far away from it.  All he can do is calculate what he would expect the energy of the photons to be.  This calculation gives an infinite energy as the photon approaches the event horizon, but it&#x27;s not a &quot;real&quot; energy, so the black hole doesn&#x27;t gain an infinite amount of energy.<p>An analogous effect occurs for an observer stationed at rest, hovering above the event horizon.  Such an observer will observe the photons from afar to be blueshifed in agreement with the distant observer.  Moreover, as this stationary observer gets closer and closer to the event horizon, the photons will be blueshifted to infinitely large energies.",1411613011

There is a clear need for many service authors to work with disparate infrastructure in a cloud provider <i>and</i> platform abstracted manner, and arguably no solid tools for doing it right now.<p>What will the future look like?

The fact that it costs billions to develop a drug is why we should support novel pathways of organising drug development, rather than disparaging it.<p>It may not really be obvious from the outside, but there is a coming crisis in that we won&#x27;t as a society be able to afford new cancer drugs. It is regularly reported that new drugs which are typically priced around US$120k per year (for multiple years in some cases) are not cost effective. Case in point: crizotonib. This is a drug that works very well at shrinking tumours and controlling disease in incurable lung cancer. It is targeted - it only works if your tumour has a particular gene fusion, which occurs in about 4% of lung cancer patients. It is well tolerated compared to chemotherapy. It&#x27;s the kind of personalised medicine we are hoping to achieve more broadly in the future. And the way it is priced isn&#x27;t cost effective [1].<p>I can guarantee you that the coming surge in immunotherapies will be exorbitantly priced. And these are drugs we will be giving not to 4% of cancer patients, but > 50% of advanced cancer patients in a given tumour type.<p>These problems are even worse in countries where the government pays for drugs, because they are far more restricted in what they can afford. Patients just end up missing out. And if you think having cancer is bad enough, knowing there is a drug that might help and not being able to afford it is just heart breaking.<p>So good luck to them, I hope they can draw some money away from nonsense like crowd funding potato salad.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2014/02/24/JCO.2013.53.1186.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2014/02/24/JCO.2013.53...</a>",1411612183

Link below provides some details, a quick excerpt though is provided here.<p>&quot;Neuropathic pain is distinguished from other pain conditions where the pain generator begins with disease of nonneural tissues. These nonneuropathic pain entities are said to be nociceptive and include conditions such as osteoarthitis and inflammatory pain.&quot;<p>Now to put it in layman&#x27;s terms from a patient that doesn&#x27;t understand the medical condition (me); the pain comes from my nerves/brain not working right.<p>I&#x27;m nowhere near as bad as the guy in this article; I am highly functioning on a day to day basis, but still have to use benzodiazepines in conjunction with opiates.  As I understand it the former helps to slow down the overreaction of messages going between the nerves and brain, while the latter helps to take the &quot;edge&quot; off from the constant pain that remains.<p>The pain can come from anywhere and everywhere. I really feel for this guy; on a real bad day the pain has gotten so bad I can barely get out of bed and move. On the rare occasion that happens I double up on the drugs and sleep it off.

The people making purchasing decisions have little motivation to be price-conscious, because they just pass the costs on to patients.  Patients, in turn, do not ask about costs associated with fetal monitoring up-front, are not in a position to do any negotiation regarding fetal monitoring in the moment, and in any case aren&#x27;t too worried because their insurance company picks up the cost.  Sort of.  The insurance company, in turn, doesn&#x27;t worry too too much about the cost of the fetal monitors that the hospital chooses, because they still figure out how to pass the cost back to the patient - which they can do successfully because in the United States it&#x27;s exceedingly rare for consumers of health insurance to comparison shop.  Instead, they just go along with whatever option is chosen by some HR folks who are mostly spending other people&#x27;s money and therefore have all sorts of incentive to not worry too terribly much about the best interest of the consumer.<p>So yes, there is some weird consumer psychology at play.

And if you have products that require lots of training and servicing, and lots of high-touch sales to get to acceptability -- yup, that&#x27;s gonna cost you! And regardless of the price point of the product, you still have the associated overhead with reaching those markets. There are things you can change about that &#x27;associated overhead&#x27; but that&#x27;s a totally different story.<p>My gut instinct is that I don&#x27;t think sales costs are really a huge driver of how companies have been approaching innovation in the breast pump space.

But it's not obvious to the average American reader, and that's what troubles me about the headline.<p>Writing is an exercise in human psychology, whether intentional or unintentional. And the phrase ""selling nuclear technology to China"" carries heavy emotional connotations. Psychologically speaking, it's scary. The typical, quasi-informed, American reader will <i>infer</i> nuclear weapons, even if it's neither stated nor implied.<p>This is why I hate sensationalist headlines, and why I give journalists no quarter in my critiquing them.

For the evidence, this thread is the strongest I know.<p>Yes, I know that Google, Microsoft, etc. should be using AI for ad targeting, search ranking, scam and fraud detection, etc.  Maybe they are.<p>Still from the tech news it does appear that the best way to get paid for such work from such companies is to do a startup with such work and then just sell your company to one of those companies.<p>I still believe that the ability of US big business, with its many 'traditions', will have one heck of a tough time running projects with anything advanced technically and not already common in the company.  In simplest terms, the existing middle and upper management has essentially no ability to work productively with anything new.<p>Indeed, broadly the leading US research universities are terrific at working, for as far as they go, with new technical ideas, and business is just AWFUL at it.  So, super tough to get a business to buy a technical idea, but they will buy a business based on a technical idea.<p>Oh there is a history:  Off and on for decades business has tried to make statistics, optimization, AI, etc. work.  The pattern is some new buzz words, some hype, some projects, some project failures, and then all's quiet again.  Thing is, of course, eventually the ideas have to work.  Business doesn't know how to make such ideas work.  Parts of US research, in or close to academics, is from a little better at making ideas work to much better.  E.g., look up the video of Eric Lander's lecture at Princeton 'Secrets of the Genome' or some such and see what he made work with new ideas and new hardware.<p>In simple terms, 'business' gets a 'business model' that is working and then hires 'line managers' to 'manage' the execution of this business model.  Typically when the model dies, the business dies.  Doing well with work that is new and advanced within the on-going business is not common.  Yes, one of the reasons is part of the tax code -- it can look better for a company's financial condition just to buy a business for, say, $50 million, than to develop in-house.<p>The good news is, this is a GREAT time for information technology startup entrepreneurs.  Don't struggle against your problems; instead, pursue your opportunities.<p>Back to it.",1323975320

3357338,comment,3353543,3355660,3,0,HilbertSpace,,,"One of the in person interviews was at a company, somewhat well known, in Connecticut.  They had a room with long tables and vertical walls about three feet high set on the tables with about enough space between each partition for a PC and a chair -- these were for 'developers' they wanted to hire.<p>Near the end of the visit, a nice girl in their HR office walked me to a bulletin board they had with their legal announcement of their job openings and their claim that they had to hire H1Bs because no qualified US citizens were available.  We didn't say anything to each other, but the scam was clear,  Hope they didn't fire her.<p>A friend, who worked with me at Yorktown Heights, recently went on an interview for a programmer slot.  Apparently all the programmers were on H1Bs from Taiwan, India, and Russia.  My friend didn't get hired.  He's terrific at C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, .NET, FoxPro, T-SQL, and system management and administration of Windows Server, SQL Server, and Exchange.  And he's an expert in AI with an applied math Ph.D. from one of the world's best math departments.  Yup, guess those guys from India, etc. were 'better qualified'.<p>The early part of my career was greatly helped by the Cold War and the Space Race.  That's why in two weeks I could go on seven interviews and get five offers.  Yes, that was near DC.  At one time I was making six times what a new Camaro cost.  I still have the Camaro!<p>But as has been documented, about then some executives from industry and government got together to see if they could change that 'horrible' situation.  The result was that the NSF set up a team of economists that did some supply-demand calculations and estimated how many more 'tech workers' would be needed to 'solve the problem'.<p>Then to get the 'tech workers', the NSF wrote into academic research grant contracts that so many students had to be supported.  And, hint, hint, hint, such students are available from Taiwan and India.<p>So, for some years freshman calculus classes were taught by graduate students with good understanding of Chinese but poor understanding of English.  Of course, if are going to study a subject in English but don't know much English, then about the easiest subject to study is math since the vocabulary is very small and the terms are very well defined.<p>Soon US citizens in college walked into computer science classes and, on the first day, saw only a minority of US citizens, sensed something wrong, and walked out.  So for some years during rapid growth of computing in the US, academic computer science was very short on US citizens.<p>Really, the H1B program was designed and intended to flood the US labor market for tech workers, and basically the program worked.<p>Congress was getting pushed from two sides on the H1B situation.  But 9/11 provided an excuse to throttle all immigration (except from Mexico!), and the permitted H1B slots were shrunk.<p>Now some tech industry executives are back at claims that the US needs more immigrant entrepreneurs to get 'skills' in 'short supply' in the US.  So, amazing situation:  In the US families commonly have one heck of a time paying for college.  Even in the US, a good computer, printer, Internet connection, work space, etc. for learning computing is somewhat expensive.  A lot of bandwidth to US servers is needed for downloads.  Yet somehow in countries with average family incomes 10% of those in the US and 10,000 miles farther away from US servers people are 'better trained' in 'technical skills'.  Amazing.<p>No, it's just an old story:  Economic activity needs land, labor, raw materials, capital, etc.  Anyone with one of these likes to believe that their part is the most valuable.  So, the people in the US with the capital, and who never wrote 100 lines of software or invented an algorithm, tend to believe that they have the most brains, the most valuable part, and should have the most power and that labor should be like workers on a factory floor 100 years ago.  They wrap themselves in notions like ""The US is a nation of immigrants"".  Yes, Mayor Bloomberg, you are one of those people.<p>To me these are now very old issues and there are some larger issues:<p>First, Moore's law and related 'laws' for other hardware have been charging along so fast that what can be assembled for a development computer or a first server for $1000 in parts is astounding.<p>Second, common US Internet bandwidth is beyond belief, even for a server.  Just do some arithmetic assuming a Web page that sends for 200,000 bits, with three ads, with some reasonable 'charge per thousand ads displayed' (CPM), and an Internet connection with 15 Mbps upload bandwidth for less than $100 a month, assume half fill that bandwidth 24 x 7, and estimate the monthly revenue.  THen can join the supercharged Corvette of the month club or the 50 foot yacht of the year club.  Multiply it out and see.<p>Third, US technical graduate education still totally knocks the socks off nearly all the rest of the world.  If have some such education and some research and also a good application, then get a computer, type in the code, go live on the Internet, get users, ads, ad revenue, a Corvette and a passenger about 5-4, 110 pounds, good figure, natural blond, cute, sweet, majored in art history, good at cooking, sewing, playing piano or violin, singing, wants to be a wife and mommy, ...!<p>Yes, I've published in mathematical statistics, that is, the more serious version of 'machine learning'.  And I've published in optimization, that is, the more serious version of 'planning' in AI.  And my Ph.D. research was in stochastic optimal control, that is, the more serious version of the AI 'planning over time under uncertainty'.  And I've done some applied math research for my project.  I recommend this path instead of 'computer science'.<p>That is, if going to grad school, I believe that there are some serious advantages in a carefully selected collection of topics in applied math instead of 'computer science'.  Start with an undergraduate major in pure math.  Sure, somewhere learn to write some code and then get, say, three hours of lectures on 'algorithms and data structures'.  In graduate school, take seriously measure theory, functional analysis, probability based on these two, stochastic processes, optimization, and mathematical statistics, at least.  My guess is that you will have the best tools for the future of computing and 'information technology' entrepreneurship and won't have much competition from outside the US or even inside.  And those math classes are NOT crowded!<p>I need to get back to it!",1323974444

Lunch has always been a good time for socializing about non-work events and developing camaraderie.<p>* Can't go out drinking after work with coworkers, same benefits.<p>* It takes much more time to personally prepare one's own lunch than taking advantage of free healthy food now offered as standard benefit at campus by most reputable tech companies like Google.<p>* No employer provided on-campus child care.<p>* No employer provided Friday massages.<p>* When you don't feel like working, can't chit chat discretely about TV and sports with workers for several hours.<p>* Less mentorship capabilities for senior experienced engineers to be paired to train and guide freshmen. However, I haven't seen this in many companies so it's not going to be missed most places.<p>It's always been an advantage to work remotely if you are doing stuff where you are a sole worker who is able to work on black box projects where you get a spec or desire in and return a finished product. This works best for people that are recognized experts and is a subset of work possibilities.<p>The real sticking issue has always been retaining the advantages of highly collaborative group and team work. Being able to talk face to face, have all hands meetings, have access to the company source control server, be able to work on something in the same room with someone working collaboratively at the whiteboard and in a text editor. Ten years ago this was completely impractical as the infrastructure was just not in place.<p>All of that has changed rapidly in the last decade as tech and services have ramped up and delivered in spades. Not only is work able to be done electronically, but it is regularly being done electronically, and it works every bit as well as face to face, often even better since you have more control over distractions.<p>It's not only super advanced high tech companiestaking advantage of technologies like video conferencing either. It's not leading edge at all anymore. Video conferencing comes built in to the ordinary inexpensive cell phones regular people have, and people with absolutely no technical ability are using it every day. It's an ordinary part of  contemporary life. It is so common to do now, the idea that companies aren't doing it already or are fearful of it is quixotic and surprising that there are hold outs who are so backwards. It's like hearing about someone from the 1950s who came out of a stasis pod or emerged from a bomb shelter who isn't aware that cell phones and laptops exist. The suggestion that some of these companies are claiming to be startup high tech companies is almost completely absurd and unbelievable. You have to wonder what sort of investors are so clueless they would invest in management of a tech company of all things that simply doesn't know what it is doing and seems oblivious or hostile to the realities of the modern world.",1323974308

Especially for a start-up, while in product development, a start-up can significantly reduce capital expenditures by not having payable for facilities. This is a huge burden on a new company and the elimination of it, is by far one of the greatest advantages. Even in established companies it can help them to significantly reduce their footprint. The developer does not incur anymore expenses because they are already paying, housing, electricity, internet, phone, etc.<p>As well one of the other great benefits of having a distributed team is that you already have the process in place to on-board anyone in the world into your company with little expense. No relocation, no facilities set up, no cube build out.<p>The biggest concern with remote developer that managers have is ""how do I know their working""? That's a red flag from micromanagement, but that is besides the point. The answer to that question should already exist in their in-house solution, all work should be done through a ticket system, and source control, if it is not then they have a lax process already and they probably have people who are not working right under their nose. The fact that a manager of development would not know how to answer the question of how to know if people are working, should be concerning to a subordinate of that manager, it may reflect that they are incompetent at their job.<p>To me their are no draw backs, I was actually opposed to distributed development a few years ago, I though it would isolate developers and not allow them to form a cohesive bond. It was ignorance on my part because Open Source projects have been proving the opposite for a long time now. I just finished a contract with IBM that was over 20 individuals on the team, all of which where remote. With Skype and other tools it was no different than all of us being in the same office.

3357288,comment,3355957,3356691,30,0,veidr,,,"Well, it's still pretty lucrative, but for Microsoft, it doesn't go anywhere anymore.<p>I am persuaded by some of the recent arguments (John Siracusa's maybe?) that both the innovation and the money in general-purpose computing industry have moved over to the consumer side of the equation, and that this change has put MS in a worse position than they've traditionally been in.<p>Dominating corporate computing (for soooo fucking loooong) made MS billions and billions, but it also held back their two products, Windows and Office.<p>They couldn't ditch compatibility, they couldn't make disruptive moves, they needed to pre-announce their roadmap... and also, I'd guess that they probably just didn't see the business-to-consumer weight shift coming, just as they didn't see the Internet coming until it ran them over. (Neither did any of their peers, though -- Apple still had their own branded AOL-clone at a late stage, what was it, eWorld? The Internet ran over everybody as the 80s turned into the 90s. And MS is <i>itself</i> one of those hidebound big corporations; it's natural for those organisms to be slow.)<p>Anyway my point is that megacorps actually want a pretty limited computing product, compared to consumers. Barring esoteric business needs, they don't need, or even want, their employees to be able to, say, shoot HD video, make unlimited anonymous video calls to anybody in the world, track themselves jogging with accelerometers and GPS, play Angry Birds, and so forth. In general, megacorps want cheap, reliable, slow-moving tools that match their slow-moving planning and frankly limited needs. And did I mention cheap. Cheap.<p>Back when a PC cost as much as a used car, business purchasing drove the industry. But the human spirit and Moore's law went marching on, and in recent years we have a variety of desktop, laptop,and pocket phone/computers that not only outperform those used-car PCs of yesteryear, but may also feature wireless and nationwide magical Internet connections, ones much faster than the 128K ISDN-line that cost me 40,000 yen per month in the 90s.<p>So now you can buy a pretty kickass computer--one that fits in your pocket, or handbag, or backpack, whatever you prefer--for the price of like, two steak dinners with a date. (Maybe three or four for the macbook air.)<p>Cost-conscious companies with big headcounts don't need any of that good shit. So they end up with, say, a fleet of Dell Vostro 620S desktop PCs with 4GB RAM, archaic spinning-platter HDDs, and Windows 7 Pro (or XP still, if they are on a volume license (which they totally are)). So we're talking about $700 with a shitty Dell monitor. 3-4 year deployment life. MS'll make whatever percentage of that, plus a bit on the Office they'll probably use, but that's it for that duration.<p>Meanwhile, a guy and his wife will drop eight times that on smartphones over the same duration. iPhone, Nexus, Galaxy, whatever. (But yeah, mostly iPhone.) Or a tablet of some kind.<p>Because they want all that good new shit, and it's no longer so expensive that they can't have it.<p>So consumers, wow what a shitty word, okay I mean 'people doing their own things and living their lives' -- let's call them PEOPLE for short -- can now afford computers.  Waitresses, stadium hot-dog boys, tax drivers, high-school students. That was not so much the case when MS started to achieve hegemony.<p>Back then, not only could PEOPLE much less frequently afford computers, but also computers weren't nearly as capable of doing the cool shit that PEOPLE are actually interested in. PEOPLE want to do cool shit, not just do some boring-ass work. Video mashups, GPS flash mobs, music buying, music bootlegging, angry birds, porn, cold fusion, etc.<p>Therefore, the companies aimed at PEOPLE are the ones who are, and have been for a while, making the more ground-breaking and innovative products. Lighter, simpler, more sensors, more stable, brand new re-architected OS software. The PEOPLE are the ones recently pushing the limits in computing. Demanding new, ground-breaking products. Rewarding innovation.<p>Computers were prohibitively expensive. But now they're not.<p>Computers used to not be able to do cool shit. Now they can.<p>So even if the ENTERPRISE market is still bigger overall in terms of units, ENTERPRISE wants shittier products, updated less frequently, for less money. That's what MS has provided over the past decade (with the exception of the less money part, har har).<p>Microsoft's products met those needs, but at the cost of tying MS to that legacy, and thwarting their ability to compete for the faster-evolving PEOPLE market, arguably now more important.<p>They are now trying to reinvent themselves. With Windows Phone surely, and it seems they are trying to make a break with the past even with Windows 8, though they are understandably halting in their efforts, loathe to disturb the waning cash cow. But serving the PEOPLE and serving the ENTERPRISE increasingly seem to be mutually exclusive. PEOPLE want new, awesome, fast, again! ENTERPRISE has different priorities. So MS has its internal schizophrenia. And no success on that front so far.<p>I didn't mean that the enterprise market was becoming less lucrative for everybody, although relative to the consumer market, it probably is. I meant that for <i>Microsoft</i> <i>specifically</i> their dominance of the enterprise over the past 15+ years has been milked for everything it is worth and has now become a hindrance to them, keeping them stuck in a narrowing rut.",1323973729

Sure they could figure out by themselves how to install extensions but why would they? Before speed dial nobody felt the need to have such a feature (so why search for an extension?), but now a lot of people can't live without it (same for multiple tabs, sessions, mouse gestures, integrated search, closed tabs bin, and so on). Until you have a feature at your finger tips you will almost always not feel the need to have it, thinking ""meh, I can live without it"". Once you start using it your perspective changes.<p>Basically, a regular user who always had a minimalistic browser will hardly feel the need to go looking for extra functionality except for dire cases (ad-block or something). So the fact that he is technically capable of installing extensions is a moot point. He first needs to become aware of that functionality and the process of testing it out should be easy enough for the curiosity to surpass the ""don't need it"" feeling. Sure, you could live with just a unique tab and an address bar. it's nice and minimalistic. How many regular users would bother installing extensions?<p>> Then again, a good number of the people I do know don't even understand the concept of a web address or even how to use bookmarks -- nevermind speed dial.<p>These would be ""regular adverse to learning"". But seriously, have you ever used speed dial? It's much easier to use than bookmarks. I explained it to a lot of regulars in 50 words or less ""click the 'plus' button, enter the address of a website you want to visit later"". It's difficult to explain this to people who can't quite hold a mouse in their hands but for regulars like my mother, girlfriend, whoever, it's very easy to explain.<p>Let's take the case of my mom. First I showed her how to open Opera instead of IE. Then, after she got used to it, I showed multiple tabs. Then, after a while, speed dial. Then I moved the tabs on the left side so that she had more space. In the case of my girlfriend I also showed her RSS so that she wouldn't check every day for new blog posts.<p>The trick is to introduce these features/changes gradually, depending on one's level of comfort with technology. At one point I actually managed to get a person with a rather ossified brain to use speed dials and multiple tabs.<p>Obviously, if a person were using a browser without a certain feature then I wouldn't go about installing extensions for them. For one, I would have to search for a decent extension since their quality is most of the times inferior to the out-of-the-box feature, the user would most likely receive strange notifications about them and wouldn't know what to do, they could pose a security risk, and so on. I'd just say ""oh, you're using browser X? I could try installing an extension... ah, screw it. Carry on with business as usual, searching on google the website that you visit 10 times a day"".<p>> So personally, I think it's a good idea to aim for a default, minimalist interface and avoid gestures and interactive UI elements that users can accidentally click or activate.<p>Well it's not a mutually exclusive affair. Opera has a truckload of features and a minimalist interface. The speed and resource consumption are as good as Chrome's (and much better when large amounts of tabs are involved, because of the one-process-per-tab slowness). So what is the reason for choosing Chrome over Opera then? Just curious.",1323973029

Specifically around how the built in super works and more generally how methods are defined on classes to begin with. In Javascript you can do interesting things with call and apply on function objects to share functionality between two objects that work the same. Similarly in Python, since the methods defined in a class are also available on the class object itself, you can use them outside of an instance and simply give them a self to operate on. The class object almost acts like the prototype object on the function object you're using as a constructor. I know the two systems are different, but they do ""feel"" real similar.

So you have both a time and resource savings. Sure, a dishwasher might not be humanoid, or even what we think of when we here the term ""robot"", but it's still a machine performing a function in place of what we would do manually.<p>With just that as a starting point, you can think up nearly unlimited examples for where this type of automation can improve our lives.

3357199,comment,3356410,3356683,2,0,kls,,,"If you look at my post history you will find that I am not a proponent of the puzzle to get a job practice. Development in the web space is a collision of right brain and left brain skill-sets, these puzzles favor the left brained model, because well most people are left brained and so they bias puzzles to left brained patterns. Further most of them are worthless at proving any competency at development.<p>Meanwhile right brained individuals posses a high creative capacity due to completely foreign ways of processing information (AKA thinking out side the box, I know I hate it to). Anyways, a lot of the big leaps is human knowledge have come from right brained individuals, specifically ones who have a particular bridge that spans both hemispheres.<p>By creating these puzzles you are guaranteeing that you will eliminate a good deal of creative candidates in favor of deeply technical candidates. Right brain dominated individuals will generally look to eliminate the problem along with the solution, people that can look beyond what is being asked and envision a different way of doing it all together. Think of puzzle solving as linear logic and cross it with creativity so they form an X, what you want to hire for (at least in web and mobile) is someone smack in the middle of the X. What code puzzles and trick questions do, is get you someone who sits on the top corner of the linear logic line in the X. All you get is someone with knowledge of how to solve puzzle games and trick questions.<p>On a personal note, I started researching this stuff because I am left handed and wanted to understand why I see things so differently from other people, and I started to draw the parallels in development. For example, when I see a puzzle, I don't try to attack the problem, I reflect on the nature of the puzzle, I try to understand why completing the puzzle is necessary, and the solutions to puzzles don't come to me through a liner process of working the problem, they come from reflection on the separate components of the problem. Many times, I will wake at night from an abstract dream that possess the solution. The way right brained people reason would be totally foreign to a left brain dominated individual. Also a big disclaimer, I am not involved in neurological sciences, what I understand of it, I gained from reading, I am in no way an expert in the subject matter, so please don't hold me out as one, there could be and most likely inaccuracy's and generalizations in my observations.<p>As for CS, I don't think it is that important in the web, I think creativity and experience trump it. For the sole reason that anyone can be taught it after the fact. Further having one guy on the team that has a deep understanding of CS problems, provides the coverage most web teams need. A good deal of senior level guys, know to go to the strongest algorithm guy when they need something to be efficient. Most of the time though in the web, we are gluing together prebuilt API's to create new business ideas. That is not meant to disparage web development, it takes a great deal of skill, it is rather meant to highlight that there is a huge gap between the skills people test for and the skills that are truly required. I always hold out Goggles hiring process as an example, I believe that their inability to innovate in the market is directly tied to their hiring practices, it is almost a case study in how to eliminate right brain dominated people from your organization.<p>Please not my observations only apply to web and mobile, I would not make the same recommendations for say, a medical device developer. It is a different field and has different needs.",1323972579

That level of hiddenness contributes to paranoia about stupid stuff.

It takes the form of a monopoly to create an incentive for works to be produced.<p>There's absolutely <i>zero</i> proof that even with all this piracy going on, that the amount of creative work has diminished. In fact, from my anecdotal evidence, I'd say there's even more creative works available now than ever before.<p>Thus, stronger copyright laws targeting non-commercial users are simply unneeded. The public is already getting the benefit of having huge amounts of art being generated (with no signs of slowdown), so there's no justifiable argument for these stronger laws, despite piracy.",1323972126

While you're correct that lambda statements are restricted, I have never actually seen a lambda expression used to extend an object.  Instead, you use a named function, which has none of these restrictions:<p><pre><code>    foo = object()\n    foo.name = ""Hi thar""\n    def hello(self):\n       print ""Hello, I'm %s"" % self.name\n    foo.hello = hello\n</code></pre>\nThis is, in fact, one of the reasons why the self parameter is explicit.",1323972116

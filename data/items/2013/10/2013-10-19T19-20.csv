When your ARM(s) and your programmable logic are on the same wafer, you can kick tasks over more quickly. And shared resources are a big boon. This obviously is a gross oversimplification, and not straightforward from a x86 development point of view. The ARM runs Linux, or you can roll your own bare-metal OS for your application, and it plays the role you mention.",1382212662

However, developing single great WinForms or WPF control is pretty challenging task.
One need excellent knowledge about the framework and tools. It is much more than programming and deployment. It is also about knowing dark internals of the platform you use.<p>For example, the greatest challenge was doing seamless Visual Studio integration. Most users didn&#x27;t know how to add a component to their software. They assumed it will &quot;just appear&quot; in Visual Studio Toolbox window and they just click on it and start using it.<p>Furthermore, most of my customers haven&#x27;t just bought the component. They required some adjustments and features here and there. They also needed assistance with implementing the component even though we provided thorough documentation with code samples.<p>Because of the above reasons, I am currently orienting more on niche components and leaving all the buttons, combos, calendars and other typical controls to big players.",1382212651

Cuban food is awesome and it&#x27;s the best South FL has to offer. Everything else is on the meh side. Almost every other metro is better with SF, LA, and NY being a lot better.<p>Weather: unless it&#x27;s the late fall or early winter, it&#x27;s really hot and humid, even at night. Yes parts of the Bay Area get hot, but it&#x27;s not paired with humidity. Heavy humidity makes breathing feel heavier, as well as making you sweat a lot from just walking for 10 minutes outside. I still remember seeing some steam leaving our heads after some pickup basketball games. To make things worse, in some seasons mosquitos will be carrying some awful diseases like encephalitis so you&#x27;ll need to wear long sleeves at night.  In south Fl, prepare to have electric bills over 200-300 or even more depending on the size of your house. Not using air conditioning will make you miserable. Really the only place enjoyable outside is on the water.<p>Bay Area weather on the other hand is like having air conditioning outside. My relatives from FL always marvel at it whenever they visit.On the bright side you have more time to prepare for a hurricane than you do for an earthquake.<p>Outdoor Leisure: The ocean is where South FL and Miami really shine. Unlike the cold murky waters of the Bay Area, in South FL the ocean waters are crystal clear. Any watersport like surfing or scuba diving is way better. (On that note watch out for sharks. Due to damage to the environment, shark attacks in south fl has risen dramatically over the years with surfers being injured the most) However, due to erosion most of South FL&#x27;s beaches are really just crushed rock and concrete which sucks. For real sand, you need access to either a private beach, an unpopular park to the north, or an island park reachable only by boat. Fishing in the ocean is great.<p>Everything else outdoorsy in South FL really sucks due to the humidity. Biking, camping, and hiking are just not as enjoyable as the Bay Area or even New York. There&#x27;s no Tahoe nearby either. Though Disney World is way better than Disney Land. It also doesn&#x27;t help that insects and spiders are a really big problem in south FL. Even indoors it&#x27;s much worse than any other place in the US that I&#x27;m aware of (imagine an ant infestation within 5-10 minutes of dropping a few crumbs of food... Fl is also the spider capital of the world.)<p>Intellectual Community: South FL and Miami have a virtually non-existent one, as opposed to the Bay Area or NY. If you want that in the Southern US, you&#x27;ll have to go to either Austin or the Atlanta metro instead. Conversation just isn&#x27;t as good here compared to other major metros.<p>Nightlife: Miami beats the Bay Area hands down in this department in both quantity and quality. Though it gets old when you&#x27;re not single.<p>General Stuff to do: I&#x27;ve always felt that there&#x27;s a lot more going on in the Bay Area, Ny, and LA. Conversely there&#x27;s not as much to do in south fl or Miami which is one reason people start families at a much younger age there.<p>Crime: Even though the stats are similar I always felt that crime is Miami is worse for one reason: really horrible crime can happen almost anywhere and at anytime (or at least that was my impression).<p>Cost of Living: South FL and Miami are significantly cheaper than the Bay Area even without factoring in the lack of state income tax. Of course you have also have to factor in the major business and job opportunities as well. Even though the startup scene is much better now, I still feel the biggest opportunities in South FL are real estate, food, and health / medical. As for the cost of real estate, you have to factor in the &quot;snow birds&quot; from the north east buying seasonal homes, so it&#x27;s not as cheap as it should be though still a lot cheaper than the Bay Area<p>Misc: Although not required, it&#x27;s wise to be fluent in Spanish in Miami. You also need a car for Miami and south FL. It&#x27;s too inconvenient otherwise.",1382209865

Part of the reason is that I struggle with it constantly.<p>A shameless self-promotion here: in the last 2 days, my coworkers and I built a web app that can take markdown files and display them in a nice webpage.  I just tried it out with the README file in this repo, and thought others might be interested in the result: <a href=""http://www.onlinemarkdowneditor.com/docs/somu/gutenberg/README.md"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onlinemarkdowneditor.com/docs/somu/gutenberg/READ...</a><p>There are quite a few similar projects out there, but we wanted to eliminate the extra steps of hosting and &quot;building&quot; documentation.  However, I think something like Gutenberg looks like a very powerful way to build documentation, and it fits in nicely with the project I just worked on.",1382209529

This has been borne out through the movement of Bitcoin miner rigs from GPUs to FPGAs to ASICs.  The power consumption and comparative performance of the GPU cannot win out over these devices.",1382209445

You wouldn&#x27;t believe what kind of 5-level-nested-if C++ statements you could find in Google&#x27;s codebase.

We also get a lot more snow a year over all at lower altitudes than anywhere else. Sure ours not always champagne powder, but with several hundred days skiing/boarding in co and ut, I feel I can make a comparison. Even heavy powder is still a shit ton of fun.<p>Also because it snows more you are less likely to have tracked out conditions any day of the week.<p>If you&#x27;re ever up here check out Crystal or baker.<p>Just keep telling your California friends it sucks up here in the Woods and I&#x27;ll keep telling mine about how bad the Mormons are in utah and we&#x27;ll both be safe.",1382209428

I&#x27;ve used it - and I was absolutely disgusted. It could not compete with the likes of Netsuite when it comes to the SMB market.<p>I&#x27;ve thought long and hard as to why SAP is not offering a &#x27;true&#x27; SaaS product - the main reason I think is still lack of customer interest. Most of SAP&#x27;s customers are large to very-large companies who require a crapton of customization to their ERP and other core systems. Their internal processes are simply not standard enough and hence a strict SaaS play product is not a great fit for large accounts.<p>On top of that the whole sales process to large accounts is radically different (and &#x27;old skool&#x27;) with consultants visiting customer sites and planning implementations... very traditional. It seems to be almost required still for ERP. Customers don&#x27;t just whip out their credit card to set up an ERP system. Yet.<p>SAP still does plenty in the cloud but most customer requests are for IaaS type cloud hosting. SaaS is not done right at SAP right now, whereas I still think they /can/ do it - they certainly have the brainpower for it. I hope development efforts will shift to a fresh product that will rival Netsuite and target the SMB market.<p>Although having said that - Netsuite&#x27;s revenue and market share compared to SAP are still tiny...",1382209415

For example current water depths (St Lawrence Seaway or on the Danube in Europe) are transmitted and used for navigation on these waterways. You also have the possibility to place a distress signal with AIS, which would quite likely lead to a Search and Rescue operation, costing huge amounts of money and taking away resources from real emergencies.<p>AIS is directly connected to an ECDIS on a ship&#x27;s bridge, which is the digital replacement for maritime paper charts. AIS targets are displayed in these ECDIS systems and (see above) in some regions of the world the information shown there is also influenced by AIS data.<p>Also a lot of ports are using AIS (together with radar) to keep an eye on the traffic - spamming those systems, which is easily possible, would quite likely cause severe troubles for larger ports like London or Los Angeles.<p>I&#x27;m honestly surprised that nobody has yet DoS&#x27;d a larger port or other infrastructure.",1382209377

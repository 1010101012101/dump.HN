This is a unique opportunity to work with some very, very smart, fun, entrepreneurial and passionate people.<p>As the 4th member of the team you will be fundamental to the company and the development of the product, working alongside experienced web entrepreneurs in taking Tuxebo from simple web app with just a few verticals to a huge marketplace covering everything rental in multiple countries.<p>The ideal candidate has a thirst to learn new skills and technologies and can pick things up easily. We hope you are full of positive energy, relish the thought of being part of a small, fast-moving team and enjoy brainstorming about new ideas.<p>You must have:<p>* Good working knowledge of Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript (jQuery). 
* Experience with some relational database, e.g. MySQL/PostgreSQL 
* Experience with Linux systems administration<p>Nice to have:<p>* Familiarity with Pylons, SQLAlchemy<p>We're more interested in your raw talent than we are your experience.<p>Send your CV with some examples of your work to colin (at) tuxebo.com.",1298381301

What matters in the future is whether or not people will actually use Bitcoin as a currency (it has no other use); I am still not convinced that it will ever become mainstream.  I hear about all sorts of places that accept Bitcoin payments, but I have yet to see anything that matters -- I cannot buy diesel with it, I cannot pay rent with it, I cannot pay utility bills with it, my local supermarket does not take it, and I cannot pay taxes with it.  Even for black market transactions (drugs, guns, etc.) Bitcoin is obscure; even with all the sales that happen on Silk Road, you are looking at a tiny fraction of the market for illegal drugs.<p>Bitcoin is in a very precarious position.  Most of the cost of buying in is the result of speculation about its future use, which is fueled by the media coverage it receives on tech news sites.  A lot of the hype is based on questionable assumptions about Bitcoin's security and about the lack of authorities in the system.  Bitcoin's ability to survive when the hype dies down and the assumptions are challenged is doubtful, at least from where I sit.",1365357324

Not all risk is equal, and you can't fully assess risk without looking at an individual's personal situation. The bad news is that measuring risk accurately can be difficult. People overestimate potential returns, and underestimate potential losses. They also often ignore opportunity cost, and fail to use realistic time frames. So I think it's hard to make a blanket statement that it's a ""safe"" time for a whole group of people to take on risk.<p>The author of this post is the perfect example of this. He thinks he's mitigating the risk of joining startups that are likely to fail by living in San Francisco, where there's a solid job market. Yet he's living in an area with a very high cost of living and apparently not saving any money, so the risk he's taking on is almost certainly a lot higher than the risk he perceives.",1365356169

5507864,comment,5506749,5506749,42,0,DannyBee,,,"Err, ""GCC does this optimization, because strlen is a ""built-in function:""<p>No.
I wrote the optimization pass that does this (GVN PRE with SCC based value numbering).<p>It does it to any pure/const function. Const ones no matter what, and pure ones if it can prove the global memory state does not otherwise change between calls in a way that impacts that pure call (IE there are times it can prove the calls that happen in between don't matter, and will still do the elimination).
You don't usually have to mark the functions const/pure if they are visible to GCC, it does interprocedural analysis to prove they are pure/const and mark them for you.<p>It will even do it through function pointers if the value numbering or alias analysis can prove what they point to, or that they don't change in between the calls.<p><pre><code>  double cos (double) __attribute__ ((const));
  double sin (double) __attribute__ ((const));
  double f(double a)
  {
    double b;
    double c,d;
    double (*fp) (double) __attribute__ ((const));
    /* Partially redundant call */
    if (a < 2.0)
      {
        fp = sin;
        c = fp (a);
      }
    else
      {
        c = 1.0;
        fp = cos;
      }
    d = fp (a);
    return d + c;
  }

</code></pre>
In this example, it will eliminate the unconditional fp(a) call at the end by reusing the value of c in the first if block, and storing the result of calling cos(a) in the else block.
IE:<p><pre><code>  double cos (double) __attribute__ ((const));
  double sin (double) __attribute__ ((const));
  double f(double a)
  {
    double b;
    double c,d;
    double (*fp) (double) __attribute__ ((const));
    /* Partially redundant call */
    if (a < 2.0)
      {
        fp = sin;
        c = fp (a);
        temp = c
      }
    else
      {
        c = 1.0;
        fp = cos;
        temp = cos(a)
      }
    d = temp;
    return d + c;
  }
</code></pre>
(attribute pure is ignored on function pointers, so you can't just s/const/pure/ and expect it to work)<p>Loop code hoisting is actually a special case of this partial redundancy elimination.<p><pre><code>  double sin (double) __attribute__ ((const));
  double f (double a)
  {
    int i;
    double c, d;
    double (*fp) (double) __attribute__ ((const));
    fp = sin;
    for (i = 0; i < 50; i++)
      {
        c = fp (a);
      }
    d = fp (a);
    return d + c;
  }

</code></pre>
The call to fp(a) in the loop will be hoisted above the loop through redundancy elimination, the call d = fp(a) will be eliminated in favor of that hoisted value.<p>Basically, the optimization is a <i>lot</i> more powerful than he describes.",1365355281

Equipment helps because you can lift heavier weights than body weight exercises and that will kickstart muscle growth more efficiently.  My wife's been doing P90x the past several months and likes the guided workouts.  She's making decent gains but it's a lot of time - about one hour a day, six days a week.  To me that's a lot of time/commitment and I think it can borderline on overtraining.<p>If I had to workout at home (I don't because my gym is just 5 minutes away and currently I'm doing a very-efficient workout just once every 3 days for under 30 minutes), then I would probably get some decent equipment.  I'd might go with a good power rack, bench, and barbell/dumbbell set.  Here's the workout I probably would do:<p>1.  Leg #1 -  I would do mostly squats with the power rack and have the safety bar set up.  I would do 4-5 sets with moderately heavy weights to tire my legs out but wouldn't go to total failure with the heavy weights.  I might go to failure with a final set with light weight (for safety) or do a final set of air squats (or with dumbbell) to tire my legs out completely.<p>2.  Leg/Lower Back #2 - I would do a modified stiff-leg deadlift (see Dorian Yates do this on YouTube).  This would exercise my hamstrings and lower back.  I personally don't really like doing full deadlifts.  I just feel unsafe with them (just personally).  With the stiff-leg deadlift I'd do probably 3 sets with moderate-heavy weight and wouldn't go to total failure (to be safe).<p>3.  Leg #3 - I'd work out my calves by holding a heavy barbell and doing calf raises (standing on toes and back down).  I'd do heavy and failure, probably just one set.<p>Now, the legs are done.  I wish I could do leg extensions but that's tough with just a power rack.  If you have space or in the future want to expand your equipment, that might be a good piece to have.  Also, leg press is a great machine too but would probably take up a lot of room (but squats could perform a lot of the similar function).<p>4.  Chest - I'd do bench press (or incline/decline bench press) with moderately heavy weights, probably 2-3 sets (not to failure).  I'd do a final set to total failure with lighter dumbbells (for safety because a barbell if let loose could really do serious damage on your face/throat), pushups, or dips.<p>5.  Shoulder #1 - I'd probably use dumbbells and do shoulder press for one set to failure (warm-up sets ok, but final set should be heavy and to failure).<p>6.  Shoulder #2 - I'd choose one of the following and mix them up: front lat raise, side lat raise, bending over lat raise, shoulder shrugs.  One set to failure.<p>7.  Back - You can do a good back workout with pulls-ups and chin-ups using the power rack (if the power rack supports your weight).  If it's difficult to do pull-ups/chin-ups, then try using a chair and doing negatives (just the down motion very slowly to build strength).  You can also get a power rack with a lat pull down (I don't know how good it is but here's the link, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Valor-Athletics-Inc-BD-Power/dp/B002EJC990"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Valor-Athletics-Inc-BD-Power/dp/B002EJ...</a>).  If you have this, then do one set of wide-grip lat pull downs to failure with heavy weight and then immediately follow it with close-grip (palms facing in) lat pulldowns (this combo will work your back like crazy).<p>8.  Triceps - I'd do some tricep extensions (standing or lying down) for one set to failure.  (Close-grip bench press is also good.  Dips are great as well, especially immediately follow tricep extensions.)<p>9.  Biceps - I'd do barbell curls or isolated dumbbell curls.  One set to failure.  (Chin-ups immediately following are great to work biceps more.)<p>10.  Abs - I'd mix it up with ab exercises and choose from crunches, reverse crunches, hanging knee raises.  Just one set very slow to failure.<p>My strategy in working out would be to do full-body workouts (that last no longer than 30 minutes) every 3 days.  For safety reasons, I wouldn't go to failure using heavy weights on squats, deadlift or bench press (that's why I'd do more than one set and use moderately heavy weight to tire muscles out and with legs/chest I would go to failure using another easier exercise like air squats w/dumbbell or push-ups).  For all other exercises the basic concept would be to lift heavy, do just one set, but do that one set to failure.  You can do warmup sets (lighter weights for a few to several reps) to warm up the muscles as needed.  I would suggest doing rotator cuff warmups/exercises to prevent rotator cuff injury (the most common bodybuilding injury).<p>Also, for all movements I suggest doing them slowly.  This will remove momentum, help prevent injury, and also increase how much your muscles are working out.  It's most important when you first start a movement not to to start fast, be jerky and use momentum.  This could result in injury.  Start slow and controlled.<p>I also suggest learning proper form for all exercises, but especially the squat, bench press and modified stiff-leg deadlift.  There's a good youtube series called So You Think You Can Squat and another called So You Think You Can Bench.  For squats remember weight back on your heels, knees out and back arched.  For bench press remember back arched and shoulder blades toward each other, and your elbows tucked in a bit.  Starting Strength has a decent DVD where Rippetoe teaches several students the squat and bench press (and other movements).  For stiff-leg deadlift I suggest watching Dorian Yates do his modified version of the stiff-leg deadlift (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtevN0SWp-o"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtevN0SWp-o</a>).  He doesn't go all the way down to the floor (just below knees).  This is my personal preference for safety reasons.<p>For equipment, I'd recommend a decent power rack (see Amazon), a good bench (Amazon again), and a good barbell/dumbbell set.  For the barbell/dumbbell set, I'd recommend some olympic plates (something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Body-Solid-ORST255-Rubber-Olympic/dp/B001F1Y17G"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Body-Solid-ORST255-Rubber-Olympic/dp/B...</a>) with one barbell bar and two dumbbell bars.<p>If you actually follow through with this, I'd love to help you get started and see your progress.  I can also suggest more resources along the way.

When you interview, you'll also meet people and learn more about what it's like to work there. So, don't worry if a job seems like it might be boring, just interview there anyway.<p>At least if you're in the SF area, you should easily be able to line up 2 or 3 interviews a week indefinitely. If you are really out of ideas for companies to apply to, just read through Techcrunch and look for a jobs page for every company mentioned. That should give you at least 10 leads a day.<p>Good luck!",1365354339

I was drawing on anecdotal experiences.<p>I've also been to Nazca and my impression was that though the tourist traffic was only a tiny fraction of Machu Picchu, the town couldn't handle much more of it. Even in off season the airport was booked to capacity and people had to wait hours for scheduled flights.<p>Another example (besides Machu Picchu) that comes to mind is Paracas (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracas_National_Reserve"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracas_National_Reserve</a>). It's hardly a mainstream tourist attraction, but the degradation from the tourist industry was pretty apparent when I visited in 2009, despite being a protected area.",1365354309

We have a lack of opportunity for young people coming from a poor background. People do fall between the cracks...<p>Also, let's be fair. Germany is not one to talk about gun violence. Last I remember, Germany was an aggressor in both World War I and World War II. Both wars accounted for roughly a 100+ million dead or wounded. Could you explain how ""weapons control laws"" could have prevented these wars? Don't get me wrong, I am for gun control...but really, it is not going to help until we fix other, more immediate socio-economic issues.",1365354231
5507801,comment,5506093,5506365,2,0,asafira,,,"I think the fact of the matter is simply this: at some point in one's career in physics, when you make a decision between being an experimentalist and theorist, you don't spend nearly as much time focusing on the theory. I don't think it's wrong, but it's just natural that at some point you won't be as fluent with the theory as theorists.<p>I was writing out how I don't agree with the author, but then I took in the bigger picture and realized that indeed I do think that a lot of the experimentalists in the field have either forgotten or just aren't that great at their math skills. I think this shows most in classes, where it's easy for them to get tripped up over details.<p>That being said, most of the time it's just simple things. I think there is still clearly a higher bar (in general) in physics than in other sciences (i.e., biology) as far as math goes, and it's far too much of a stretch to say you don't need to know math well to do well. We aren't talking about algebraic topology here, I think Wilson is commenting even on just multivariable calc and linear algebra. Quantum Mechanics without linear algebra? At the very least, it would be very hard to learn (if at all).<p>If anyone from non-physics fields has some comments, I would be interested to hear.",1365354225

Entanglement is weirder than that though as Bell inequalities attest - it's as if I raised my flag at 11:59 and you did too despite the prior agreement.<p>I'm not sure if current physics has an explanation, but the last time I read around this, it seemed that the relativist position was that no FTL communication was occurring between particles because a transfer of information would require a slower than light communication between us so that we both knew what to measure. Or to pose it a different way - even if the electrons seem to communicate faster than light, technically we can't tell that it happened until later.",1365354097

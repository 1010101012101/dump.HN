I have found that you kinda get a ""discount"" when you get enough into sleep-debt. I slept about 15 hours over 6 nights once, and after basically sleeping for 24 hours straight, I was totally fine.

641739,comment,641523,641523,0,0,tom_b,,,"Thanks, at first glance this looks like a good set of notes to skim over.  I wouldn't spend a tremendous amount of time trying to deeply understand the query optimization details.  My experience has been that being able to grab out low hanging fruit (ie, are the right indexes being used by the query optimizer, check the plan your RDBMS generates) is more helpful. Most people will never need to think about query optimization as in the notes.<p>Understanding indexing and index selectivity is probably a bigger deal for most apps these days.  At least, it seems that I come across many more read intensive apps than high transaction rate apps.  But I'm a data warehouse app guy usually.<p>I'd also strongly recommend the Joe Celko books for really building up your SQL chops.  Once you have a intermediate understanding of your RDBMS backend and SQL, you'll have all the knowledge you'll need for 90% of db development and know how to investigate the other 10%.<p>I have typically joined projects after the db has been designed.  I need to work on being able to quickly refactor table designs to cleanup and enforce constraints.  My gut feel is that the best way to do this is to first define a data access layer via some type of procedural API to the other devs on a project and then cleanup the backend design on the side while the project goes forward.<p>Now, if only SQL had the ability to define and dynamically build first class functions as well . . . I could do some snazzy stuff much quicker . . .",1244133991

641722,comment,641313,641636,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"First off, it's Lua, not LUA. Not an acronym. :) It means ""moon"" in Portuguese. (Its predecessor was called 'Sol'.)<p>I use it as my day to day scripting language, and also for parsing (with LPEG, which is <i>awesome</i>), general prototyping, etc. I tend to use Lua as a standalone language and as a nicer interface to C and its libraries, rather than embedded in mainly-C projects.<p>A couple personal projects I have going in Lua at the moment are 1) a language-independent tool for locating copy-and-pasted code that has been modified in place, and thus is hard to locate via simpler tools such as grep (which I hope to release this summer); this has involved research and a lot of dead ends trying various parsing-based techniques. It's a surprisingly tricky thing to do well. 2) a randomized testing framework (think QuickCheck) for Lua, which is usable, but needs more polish and documenting before I release it, 3) a profiler with different analysis than LuaProfiler, 4) an RSS library, and 5) a bunch of other wrapper libraries in various stages of polish. I have a wrapper for Redis (more idiomatic of Lua and a bit faster than the official one), a library for mpd, a wrapper for xosd, and other such odds and ends. There's probably stuff I'm forgetting. I start too many projects... All of the above will be released under one of the BSD/MIT-ish licenses, when/if I feel they're polished enough.<p>Overall, Lua has taken over the niches for which I used to use Python or Chicken Scheme. It's a really nice language, especially if you're comfortable with a bit of C now and then. It's not good for everything, but its design is refreshingly modest about just ducking out of the way and letting you use other tools when they're a better fit. (Its minimalism and prototype-based object system also appeal to me.)<p>There are a bunch of other little tools in my bin directory that I should clean up and share, but that's probably true for everyone here.",1244133534

It makes me sad that the Rails community tries to obscure its security problems and ""shoot the messenger"".  The guy that reported the bug is <i>trying to help you</i> and <i>trying to help the community</i>.  Getting mad at him isn't going to make the bug go away, it's just going to make you look like a childish moron.

Sometimes taking your app down is better than waiting for some ""core team"" to make an ""official fix"".

The right to vote in a presidential election does seem rather paltry.<p>But, just because you don't <i>choose</i> to participate more in the political process and have more influence doesn't mean that you are <i>unable</i> to participate.  That is a very big distinction that a lot of people have shed blood over in the past three hundred years.<p>But, as paltry as the vote may seem, you get the benefits of a reasonably transparent, efficient and honest government system.  And, the last 9 months aside,  you are able to participate in one of the largest, most vibrant economies in the world at one of the (comparatively) lowest levels of taxation in the industrialized world.",1244132753

For someone who's healthy, it may seem insignificant when the baseline risk is low, but for someone who develops a chronic disease, in hindsight a 20% reduction may be very appealing. Minimizing regret is important.T<p>You should read the article; the rest of the paragraph is as follows:<p>> So with lung cancer we could buy as a society the observation that cigarettes cause lung cancer because it was and remains virtually impossible to imagine what other factor could explain an association so huge and dramatic. Experiments didnt need to be done to test the hypothesis because, well, the signal was just so big that the epidemiologists of the time could safely believe it was real. And then experiments were, in effect, done anyway. People quit smoking and lung cancer rates came down, or at least I assume they did. (If not, were in trouble here.) When I first wrote about the pseudoscience of epidemiology in Science back in 1995,  Epidemiology Faces Its Limits, I noted that very few epidemiologists would ever take seriously an association smaller than a 3- or 4-fold increase in risk. These Harvard people are discussing, and getting an extraordinary amount of media attention, over a 0.2-fold increased risk. (Horn-blowing alert: my Science article has since been cited by over 400 articles in the peer-reviewed medical literature, according to Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge.)<p>The point is that we don't know if there's a 20% increase of risk if you start eating more red meat. We only know that the people who elected to do, and were sampled in the study (the top quintile), did have a 20% increase. There's a big difference here; statistics is subtle.<p>> As for scientific validity of those studies, doing proper scientific studies of diet is so difficult it might as well be impossible.<p>I agree, but then we should refrain from telling people that meat, and red meat in particular, is what's killing them.

This takes about 100 days right now, during which the patient has to be isolated in an environment almost entirely free of pathogens.<p>So if you want affordable bone marrow transplantation, you either need to find a way to cheaply isolate someone while giving them a very high level of medical care, find a way to grow a complete immunosystem in a few days, or find a new drug that'll effectively fight off every possible infection in a body with no protections of its own. Oh, and then of course you have to affordably stop the donor cells from attacking the host's body, too. Finding a cost-effective drug to cure AIDS looks a lot more likely to me than any of that happening in my lifetime.",1343407075

Riak is not like Mongodb or Couch; it is not another monolothic database with a different data model.<p>Riak's basic advantage is the way it handles scaling. Unlike monolithic databases that scale horizontally using master/slave architectures, Riak is distributed on day-1; your starting configuration would be multiple servers. Riak has no master servers. As and when needed, you add new nodes to Riak clusters with a single command.<p>What this offers developers is essentially a locally-hosted version of S3 with performance and cost characteristics that admit to creating lots of small objects.<p>Riak has other features (mapreduce over collections of objects, indexing, full-text search), but fundamentally, you'd use Riak for the kind of application that could be reasonably built around S3-scale key-value.<p>In practice, I've found Postgres and Riak to be a pretty good 1-2 punch: metadata (anything I'd use to formulate queries) goes to Postgres, bulk data to Riak.<p>My application doesn't have a zillion users, nor does it store lots of ""files""; what it does do is generate a <i>lot</i> of variable-sized historical data.

You probably found yourself predicting the next concept a teacher would introduce, because it just ""makes sense."" Not all students are that way. Most are not.<p>The two people involved here are fighting over two different ideas. Sal is being pedantic, but is right, <i>slope</i> is defined as x/y. What the other guy was saying is that slope represents <i>rate of change</i>, which is a much more important concept to early algebra, and the underpinning of why you actually care about slope in physics and calculus.

He wants to invert the classroom. Traditional classroom has passive lectures followed up with problem solving which is to be done at home. He says it's better if people can do the passive things at home at their own pace, and use the classroom for problem solving.<p>The problem with passive lectures in classroom is many a times students are sitting through lectures they don't follow because they don't know the prerequisites; and often times students by themselves aren't able to figure out if they can't make heads and tails of probability problems, what is it that they need to know so that they can understand it. In his talk, Khan demonstrated the software(I haven't used; I might be off) which can track your deficiencies. For example, you are struggling at basic probability. The framework will drop you down to permutation/combination problems. You still are struggling; introduce <i>fundamental principle of counting</i>. You are doing fine now. So explain permutations based on counting principle.<p>Lacking the prerequisites is one of the problems. We have people who learn at different rate, people who aren't fluent in the language the lecture is delivered in, people who are shy/under-confident to speak up, people who are smart and are bored and feel left out, people who aren't very smart(lack the fundamentals, slow learners...) and are lost and feel left out.<p>If Khan Academy, or any other self-paced learning resource can solve these problems; coupled with classroom guided problem solving and projects, that will make a huge difference.",1343405885

You could argue that if you're talking about slope, you mean slope of a line.

To take a trivial example:<p><pre><code>    double square(double x) {\n        return x * x * x;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf you look at the purpose of that function, it's to return the square of a number.

As for their abstracted nature, one of the distinguishing features of humans vs animals is our ability to use tools, devices which are one step abstracted from direct action.

I have ten fingers; with a keyboard, I can have instantaneous command over ten actions (though eight or nine is more usual). With a console controller, it's <i>two</i>. (Four if we count triggers, but console games tend not to have fully-reconfigurable controls.)<p>I ran into this playing the Tony Hawk games, which I loved on the PC; on the console, executing complex combos feels like a thumb workout.<p>Obviously it is still a stylistic choice; the keyboard enables faster, more focused play, while the controller encourages a more laid-back playstyle which still <i>feels</i> competitive. But it does that by deliberately crippling the control you have, and you should embrace that.",1343404882

It is certainly how <i>I</i> was taught about slope, and I went on to graduate from MIT, so whatever nuance this definition allegedly didn't catch did me no harm.<p>Once you get to calculus, things get a little more complicated, as the slope at a given point is defined using derivatives, but I'm pretty sure that ends up being the same as the rise over the run of a tangent line.<p>In any case, anyone who would make such a lame criticism, should just STFU. If that's the best criticism they can come up with, they surely can't have much of value to say. Also, when teaching something like algebra, it's more important to make the material approachable and comprehensible, rather than define everything to a level of rigor that would make Russell and Whitehead happy.",1343404858

It's a trivial complaint, I'll give you, but it's one that's bitten me on more than one occasion (you think I'd learn!). There's also no foldr unless you implement it yourself.<p>I badly misspoke when I said that you could pickle comprehensions, because what I <i>meant</i> was that the language gives you no hint that you might be able to. Pickling<p><pre><code>  sum([ os.stat(f).st_size for f in os.listdir(""."") ])\n</code></pre>\nis <i>obviously</i> (I hope) not going to work. On the other hand pickling<p><pre><code>  [ lambda n: n % 2 == 0 ]\n</code></pre>\nintuitively ought to, since pickling [ isEven ] would work fine. I've had to rewrite a couple of modules because of this - again, maybe I should have learnt from my mistakes - but it gives me the general impression of ""avoid lambdas and functions that regularly use lambdas, because they're occasionally a lot of unexpected work"".",1343404802

I'd rather hear a 'no comment' than an outright lie. Example: I once asked a CEO who had laid off most of his staff how many employees he had left.  His response after an awkward pause: ""I don't know"".  Uh, right.<p>Stats are great and can definitely help your cause, but don't take them from an obscure source or try to make them sound better than they are.<p>Regarding the competition: know who's out there, what they're doing, and how you're different.  If I ask you about the competition and you say you're not sure, I know you're either lying or incompetent.<p>Also, to the people saying that it's okay to ask about seeing an article before publication, let me reiterate: don't do it.  It immediately makes me think  you're a jackass, even if you do it politely.<p>If you know your website or company has a major flaw, you're taking a risk whenever you try to hide it.  If the journalist misses it, then great.  But if we stumble across it later then there's a good chance we'll get annoyed. I prefer a tactic that lawyers tend to use: preempt the tough questions by pointing out your flaws ahead of time and explain how you're going to fix them.",1233021454
451464,comment,450486,450720,0,0,bokonist,,,"The modern ""conservative"" is someone who wants to turn back the clock thirty years.  Since the schools and universities are solidly leftist, the country as a whole moves left over time.  The ""conservative"" of today is thus liberal by the standards of forty years ago.  For instance, can anyone name one issue on which Bush was to the right of John Kennedy?<p>You can basically define yourself along the right-left continuum by stating the year to which you wish to roll back the American political system.  Progressives want to keep on marching forward.  The folks at the National Review want to roll back our political system to the Reagan era.  Ron Paul wants to roll back the system to 1900.  Mencius Moldbug wants roll it back to 1687.<p>What's interesting is that some phenomena that we now view as ""arch-conservative"" - such as evangelical Christianity - turn out not to be very conservative at all.  In 1900, the evangelicals were firmly in the camp of the left ( think William Jennings Bryan, Woodrow Wilson, or Richard Ely).",1233021441
451463,comment,451379,451379,0,0,jmatt,,,"This is quite the intriguing science mystery. I really enjoyed it. And it ended with a possibility of some pragmatic benefits too:<p><i>Oklo also demonstrates a way to store some forms of nuclear waste that were once thought to be almost impossible to prevent from contaminating the environment. Since the advent of nuclear power generation, huge amounts of radioactive xenon 135, krypton 85 and other inert gases that nuclear plants generate have been released into the atmosphere. Nature’s fission reactors suggest the possibility of locking those waste products away in aluminum phosphate minerals, which have a unique ability to capture and retain such gases for billions of years.</i><p>Excellent!",1233021379

But web users in general are not sticklers about video compression artifacts: YouTube was for a long time limited to 320*240 video compressed with Sorenson Spark (a H.263 variant of worse quality than Theora), and that didn't hinder its success.

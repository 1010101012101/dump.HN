5133152,comment,5132343,5132343,1,0,aldous,,,"Well you know, I find I agree with a fair amount in this post. At the core of FB is there not a paradox - the more 'connected' we become online the less we engage in more substantive communication offline? For me, I see an abstraction that takes place; an FB profile check on a friend replaces a phone call, an FB invite replaces a more direct intimate invitation etc. Are such abstractions corrosive to relationships in the long run? I'm increasing concluding they are. Further, does a system that abstracts relationships amplify negative patterns of behaviour too, such as bullying, stalking, soap boxing and ranting polemics, obnoxious behaviour/superfluous prattle for sake of attention seeking etc? Possibly. The toxic paring of FB with the complications of adolescence seems tangible to me too; my 14 year old step sister has become a veritable celebrity at school as she uses FB as the medium with which to qualify quite natural inclinations for her age; peer recognition, kudos, etc. Robbed of context and played out in front of an goading and somewhat unsympathetic audience these natural inclinations have warped into something quite odd and unpleasant. I hope she'll look back and laugh one day but you know some kids don't pull through it: <a href=""http://goo.gl/nzDb1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/nzDb1</a> You can be mentally rather delicate in these years. As an aside, the distracting potential of FB seems glaring obvious too; I have witnessed colleagues productivity plummet when some FB scandal erupts in their digital social sphere, frustrating when this impacts the rest of the teams work day. As someone said on here before, I guess use in moderation is the key, but again, if people don't like the FB service and want to opt out all together, 'more power to them' I say. This perception of  a FB profile as a necessity in the 21st century seems fanciful on one level and insidious on another.",1359453222

5133148,comment,5127251,5131318,2,0,alexkus,,,"Again you're missing the point. Just checking 31 sockets for data is much much much less work than checking 600k sockets, even if they are all via local IPs.<p>I agree that a connection from a local IP is not as much work for the kernel as from a remote IP, but it's the same amount of work for the server portion of the software to service each of the connections whether they are local or remote. Remember too that the host machine is running both the server and the process generating the client load. Generating the client traffic will be costlier than what is saved by the local traffic not traversing the full stack.<p>Yes, ideally two machines (one with a whole bunch of virtual IPs to fake the clients, and the other hosting the server) would be a better test, that way the machine hosting the server is going via the full network stack.<p>> Do it over an actual network from 50K different IPs and see how that performs.<p>And I don't see what difference (as far as how the networking performance of the server will vary) of having unique IPs or not will make. Incoming connections (from a real network) are going to cause the same amount of work regardless of the remote IP (assuming there are no DNS lookups); and iptables or firewall stuff should have minimal impact even if you spray a huge number of unique IPs at it.<p>For my testing of a similar scenario I use a couple of old blade servers (2 chassis of 24 PIII 700MHz blades each) to generate the load. Each blade has a unique IP and for 500,000 connections per blade I need 1M sockets (each connection can have two open concurrently as they overlap) = 41666 sockets per blade; that fits with a tweak to the ephemeral port range.<p>My server keeps long polling connections for ~25 seconds. The total network cost of each poll is ~800 bytes[1] (TCP connection initiation, HTTP request, HTTP response, TCP teardown). 500,000 polls every 25 seconds = 20,000/sec.<p>20,000 conns/sec * 800 bytes = 16,000,000 bytes/sec = 128,000,000 bits/sec.<p>Luckily each blade chassis has 3 x 100Mbps ethernet ports (Gigabit would have been nice but these are old blade servers) on separate backplanes (public, private, mgmt) so I split the 24 blades up with 8 on each interface to keep well below the 100Mbps limit of each port.<p>1. Which is why Websockets is much more efficient, roll on adoption in the popular browsers (not just the few who run relatively recent installs of Chrome/Firefox).",1359453097

It uses salts and extremely expensive key setup (ie different for each password even if the original plaintext is the same).<p>It is true that if the password is one of the most common such as ""pass"" or ""password"" then you'll be to tell if that is the case in a reasonable amount of time.  However you could trivially do that testing without going to the lengths of breaking into and compromising systems.<p>All this RSA mechanism does is split the password verification into two halves each with knowledge of about half the information necessary to compromise.  In theory compromising one system won't help you - you need to do both.  But that doesn't help against the weakest passwords since they can just be tried against the system.<p>There are some good presentations on the bcrypt wikipedia page.  Of note is that 1,000 password guesses per second per system is roughly what happens now, and that scrypt is better for some circumstances.  By contrast legacy schemes have rates from 10 million to 2 billion per second - even something as modern as WPA has 100,000 guesses per second per system crackers.<p>But back to the original point - a company with weak administration and security practises isn't going to get any better by doing more of it.",1359451830

There is no other purpose to have them on the train.  People like to think that having eyes on the ground stops accidents, because they think eyes on the ground stops physics, but if you are on the train track and the engineer can see you then physics says you better get off the train track because neither the engineer nor anyone save God Himself will stop the train from reaching your current location.&quot;<p>The train engineer&#x27;s job is to hit the start button when the switching office says to.  It&#x27;s drive-by-wire, and he&#x27;s not only just a wire, he&#x27;s statistically speaking the most bug prone wire on the train.<p>He also had some sharp words for management on the topic of encouraging engineers to think they were responsible for accidents, claiming that it caused preventable suicides after unpreventable ones.",1378105152

6313770,comment,6309618,6311353,4,0,comex,,,"As someone who wrote multiple iOS jailbreaks, the above post is entirely incorrect.<p>(1) It is almost certain that JTAG is not exposed on an iPhone, as this would be a massive and obvious error on Apple&#x27;s part, though I do not actually have proof of this.<p>(2) No type of debug interface is exposed via the dock connector, as this would also be a massive security hole.  Rather, as previously stated, imaging software uses exploits, often for bugs previously found by jailbreakers and since patched.  (Note that people have used the kernel debugger over the serial interface on some dock connector pins, but only as a convenience after exploiting the kernel to enable this functionality.  It is normally disabled.)<p>(3) A raw block copy of the NAND is useless, because the data is encrypted using the UID key hidden in the hardware AES engine.<p>(4) Even if you get an exploit running, some information (sensitive information minus the information that&#x27;s required for operation while locked) is encrypted with the passcode.  You can bruteforce the passcode, the process of testing a particular passcode requires using the aforementioned UID key, which you can only ask the hardware AES engine to encrypt and decrypt things with, not actually retrieve.  Therefore, without some really powerful hardware attacks, bruteforcing must be conducted at a fixed rate on the phone itself, rather than offline on a compute cluster.  If you use a 4 digit passcode, this isn&#x27;t much help, since it doesn&#x27;t take long to try 10,000 possibilities, but a good password will take a long time to bruteforce.<p>Not perfect - among other things, as previously mentioned, you&#x27;re screwed if they also have the computer you sync the phone with - but not bad.<p>See: <a href=""http://images.apple.com/iphone/business/docs/iOS_Security_Oct12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.apple.com/iphone/business/docs/iOS_Security_Oc...</a>",1378104538

So a restaurant that once used to have 10 servers working at any given time will need maybe 3 or 4 with automation going on.<p>> So I wouldn&#x27;t count on robots replacing humans in actual customer service - on the contrary, I expect companies that do not provide proper human interface start losing customers to those who do.<p>Right, but that&#x27;s for the /edge/ cases. Like when you&#x27;re going through automated calls and the robot voice has you go through a process of giving information in various ways -- either by saying something out loud and it&#x27;ll try to determine what you said, or you just simply type it through the keypad... and then when you <i>fail</i> to communicate properly you get transferred to a real human being.<p>I can tell you that a very high amount of my friends/family relatives (middle-class folks) cite the reason of their not going to restaurants to be the cost of eating out. Automation will help reduce that cost, so I don&#x27;t think you have a very strong argument here that people will just stop going to restaurants. And, there is more to a restaurant service than just the &#x27;server experience&#x27; -- there is the decor, the fine view, the washed dishes, the nice walk around the town it takes to get there and so on.<p>As for pubs and bars, yes they are the places that people go to socialize, but not all of that socialization is with the <i>bartender or the server</i>, it&#x27;s with other people too who&#x27;re there to also socialize.

Whether it be Hizbollah joining the side of the Syrian regime via Lebanon, Russia, China, North Korea and Iran delivering the regime military, political and financial support&quot;<p>is complete BS. Syria is an historical ally of Iran. It dates way before the protests, and the proof of that is in its control over Lebanon via the Hezbollah (which has been financed by Iran for more than 20 years).<p>If you want to understand arabs war in general, look at who&#x27;s Shia and who is Sunni (and from time to time, when sunnis and shias don&#x27;t fight each other, look at who is a jew).<p>Now for a quick sum up on the situation : Iran is trying to become a nuclear power. It&#x27;s a shia country. Sunni don&#x27;t want that (mainly saudi arabia and qatar). Syria is ruled by shias but the population is mostly sunni, so the ruling party is allied with Iran.
Rebels are sunnis and mostly financed by saudi arabia and qatar.<p>Until there was chemical weapons involved, most occidental countries were quite happy to see iran fight saudi arabia using a proxy war in Syria. They sell weapons (Russia sells to Syria, US sells to Saudi Arabia), and enjoy seeing radical islamists and dictatorial regime kill each other instead of joining forces against Israel or bomb european cities.<p>But since Mr Obama said there was a &quot;red line&quot; and now that that &quot;red line&quot; has been crossed, US is forced to take side.<p>On a sidenote, the US has helped islamists gain power recently in Egypt, against dictatorial regimes, hoping for a middle term transition to democracy (a bit like what is hoped for Turkey), but that failed very recently with egyptians wanting islamist party out.

Segregation does not help communities. Especially communities that are so similar. What if Python programmers never talked to Ruby programmers and Ruby programmers never talked to Lisp programmers?

7154500,comment,7152068,7152068,19,0,DigitalSea,,,"I implore all developers to learn native Javascript methods, because I strongly believe jQuery has created a generation of developers who know the library but not the language. You&#x27;d be surprised how many developers I&#x27;ve come across think iterating over an object or array requires Javascript and how many people don&#x27;t know how to write a simple for or while loop in Javascript. jQuery is a fantastic library, but it is by no means a cure-all for Javascript problems.<p>Now about this site itself. This is a great idea getting people to use and understand native methods, but please also understand that native methods aren&#x27;t always necessarily the most efficient choice. There are a few of parts of this site I think send the wrong message. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think this is great, but sometimes native methods are no better than jQuery&#x27;s.<p>The first one being jQuery&#x27;s each method. It is a known fact that jQuery&#x27;s each method is extremely slow, it works, but from a optimisation perspective native ways of looping an array are always the fastest and most efficient.<p>The alternative given for a jQuery.each statement is the IE9+ supported Array.prototype.forEach — now you&#x27;d think this would be faster right? It&#x27;s actually still not as performant as it could be. As this jsPerf set of benchmarks shows is that a for loop is the most performant option: <a href=""http://jsperf.com/foreach-vs-jquery-each/38"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/foreach-vs-jquery-each/38</a> — it might not be as pretty as jQuery.each or Array.prototype.forEach, but heck, it&#x27;s a whole lot faster than the alternatives.<p>The second being the use of querySelectorAll (which is awesome btw). It has similar capabilities to that of jQuery&#x27;s native wrapper for querying, it looks just as nice, but once again the performance isn&#x27;t all that great. Looking through multiple jsPerf benchmarks, querySelectorAll is rarely the best option to use in most cases. This is an example of one: <a href=""http://jsperf.com/queryselectorall-vs-getelementsbytagname/44"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/queryselectorall-vs-getelementsbytagname/4...</a> — if your selector is extremely complicated, think to yourself, how can I make this easier to write? Do I need to query a chain of five classes and use CSS3 selectors, or can I just add an ID to the element I want and query it using document.getElementById instead.<p>Sometimes jQuery is needed though. It saves considerable amounts of time, especially when the budget of a project is tight and timeline is even tighter and you just need to get something out the door as soon as possible. If you have the time to properly build whatever it is you are building, consider spending that extra 15 seconds writing a for loop to iterate over that array or object.<p>And to those who understand and have taken a look into the internals of how some jQuery methods work like document.ready, you&#x27;ll appreciate and know just how many different browser quirks the jQuery team have solved for us. There are quite a few methods where jQuery hides the gory details of a sometimes difficult to get right across all browsers feature.<p>Personally my favourite thing about Javascript is the power of documentFragment: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragme...</a> — this is something all developers who use Javascript need to know about. It helps prevent reflowing and redrawing as well as being extremely efficient and fast for modifying and inserting elements into a page.<p>Over all of this I think we all need to reflect on the state of Javascript. It&#x27;s a whole lot more powerful and better than it was 10 years ago, but I think because of the likes of jQuery and others, people have become obsessed with pretty code and methods.

For example, the `this` in an event handler is the actual DOM element, not a jQuery object. Whether you handle that directly with DOM methods or wrap it with `$(this)` is up to you. Many people prefer the latter but the former is often smaller and prettier.<p>> For example converting a wrapped node to a native DOM node requires an extra call that, in my opinion, is ugly: $(&#x27;.something&#x27;).get(0); and could be considered to be an anti-pattern.<p>How common is that, really? Your example assumes a single element with that class name. Why not chain a jQuery method behind it and handle the 0 or N cases as well?",1391129182

I don&#x27;t self insure my car (for collision/comprehensive) because it&#x27;s too big of an expense for me to absorb at any one time without severe hardship.<p>Nuclear reactors (as they stand today) are more like cars than computers.  They tend to rob a few people of their whole lives and really eff up the ones that don&#x27;t die.  Coal plants have the &quot;advantage&quot; of robbing many people of a portion of their lives in a more subtle way.<p>LFTR reactors have physics on their side in that if containment is lost, so is criticality.  Boiling water reactors, pressurized boiling water reactors, etc in my mind can&#x27;t be made safe because they require power to stay safe, even if they&#x27;re not generating power.<p>You&#x27;ve suggested that so long as the generators and whatnot arrive eventually, things will be fine.  The problem is that you&#x27;ve made the assumption that somehow, some way the generators will arrive and the reactor can be made safe again over the course of some weeks or months.  Nuclear reactors are one of the few pieces of infrastructure that can&#x27;t simply be abandoned if something bad happens, or else the problem gets worse and worse and worse.  This is a positive feedback cycle rather than a negative one.  Positive feedback often &quot;blows up&quot; (a term we use in electrical engineering) or grows without bound.  Nearly everything else in modern society functions with negative feedback and that kind of intrinsic safety is what most people want.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that ALL nuclear reactors are by definition unsafe; just all the ones that are currently operating commercially because it&#x27;s such a nightmare to permit new designs and the existing manufacturers have no interest in inviting competitors into their market.",1391127911

7154368,comment,7152671,7152671,6,0,darklajid,,,"I&#x27;ve got mixed feelings this time.<p>Disclaimer out of the way: No sense of entitlement here, every time I see a challenge like this I expect to fail. I&#x27;m really, really happy that people (Stripe, here) offer their time and resources to entertain us.<p>I&#x27;m a proud owner of the CTF2 shirt.<p>This time I couldn&#x27;t finish level4. My takeaway is: I invested too much time and shouldn&#x27;t have done it. I guess I&#x27;ll pass next time when a challenge w/ a deadline starts.<p>Level0 was a nice warm-up.<p>Level1 was immensely satisfying and interesting, but the pvp challenge was .. well.. dead. By the time real life let me join others were throwing GPU based miners at the problem and traffic was constantly heavy anyway. So amazing level, the arena type thing was imho not a good idea.<p>Level2: Here the problems began. Local tests and remote tests diverged, plus this level was pushing you to use node.js. Will come back to this later. The actual challenge was interesting, so my issues here were infrastructure and .. language<p>Level3: This was absurd. Again, the challenge sounded interesting. The sample solution you&#x27;re supposed to fix came in Scala and you had some constraints (time/memory). I had a couple of (locally) working solutions that never made it remotely. After hours and hours I gave up and solved this challenge - by executing grep for each request. Yes, I called grep and parsed the output, didn&#x27;t index a thing. That felt .. bad.<p>Level4: Didn&#x27;t solve it. Utterly frustrating. The consensus (hah.. hah.. get it?) seemed to be that raft (goraft) would be the way to go, but I invested again hours (8? Probably a lot more) and didn&#x27;t make it. Problems with the deployment were mentioned on the channel again and again, goraft has even open pull requests and recent tickets from the stripe guys, as far as I can tell. Dependencies were a mess. Someone built the reference solution to this level and found bugs in goraft (see Github, goraft issues)? I .. don&#x27;t think this was a good idea. Plus, forcing unix-sockets into the game (where everything around it doesn&#x27;t support those and hey - if you want to have a &#x27;curl for unix sockets&#x27; you end up finding another go project that just didn&#x27;t work for me) was really messy.<p>So, putting aside the fact that I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to clear level4 (it was obviously possible!): The templates came in nodejs/Scala/go. I knew a little about nodejs, nothing about the other two. Ripping the provided framework out was kinda possible, but a pain in the ass to debug (you could run a script that installed stuff remotely - I tried solving level3 in Clojure and it was a miserable experience). So challenging tasks plus new languages, plus deadline, plus &#x27;servers are overloaded and cannot answer&#x27;: This was just way too much for me. I still tried to solve level4 until the server fell over again and the CTF was finally closed.<p>My take away: All the ideas, the problems, were cool and interesting. But I guess even the Stripe guys were surprised to see the load/spikes/outages - probably a consequence of the &#x27;distributed&#x27;/&#x27;load handling&#x27; type of problems, versus the &#x27;try to break in&#x27; challenges last time. It hooked me with the leaderboard, nice website, good problems. But it was an exercise in frustration for me (and Scala/Go are _really_ not for me..).<p>That aside: Thanks a lot, Stripe. I cannot even begin to imagine how much work you guys invested in the preparation and administration/maintenance. I do consider the extension fair - and didn&#x27;t gain a thing from that (was already at l4 at that point).",1391127437

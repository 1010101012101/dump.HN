91692,comment,91667,91667,0,0,downer,,,"Naively I'd say you can't do it without a mind-reader.  Someone may not know what they don't know; thus an intelligent agent probes to determine.  This is where tutoring/mentoring comes in, but it's never exact, as the instruction from any given person is probably hardly ever the <i>most</i> effective way to get the concept across to someone <i>else's</i> brain.<p>Just present all the material and they can skip ahead as warranted.  But books tend to be better at reinforcement than introduction; e.g. go out in the field with a paleontology dig and you'll probably remember stuff you learn much better because of the associations with all your senses at once.<p>I often note important but <i>subtle</i> points in material when re-reading on a subject <i>after</i> personal experience, which I missed when reading the same thing previously.  In the repeat case I now have <i>references</i>, and the written word causes those experiences to spring forth from whichever compartment of my mind contained them, whereupon I can hold up the new piece of information to see how it fits, compare it to what's already there, add it in, and then pack the whole thing back up.<p>The best way to teach someone is to get them as engaged as possible through as many avenues into their brain as possible.  You can read about elephants all you want but there's no substitute for meeting one in person.",1198221870

It looks like a great platform for implementing something like a directory server.  <p>If rumors are to be believed, SimpleDB is really just Erlang + BerkeleyDB with some cpu limits (which makes sense since BerkeleyDB really only gives you access methods and raw storage).  <p>Personally, I'd like to see Amazon start providing a little tighter integration between their services.  I'd like to be able to register a callback on an S3 upload that would enqueue an update to SDB via SQS and then bill the customer via FPS.",1198221207
91690,comment,90387,91100,0,0,downer,,,"> So, what you mean by saying something is more intelligent than something else?<p>Obviously people say that all the time despite our lack of a definition for <i>exactly what it is</i>, so we apparently don't need an <i>exact definition</i>.<p>> and unless they are deterministic, you can't write code.<p>You might be interested to know that the behavior of your OS isn't deterministic once you add a second CPU.",1198220862

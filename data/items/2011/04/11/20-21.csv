2434321,comment,2432087,2432197,1,0,runT1ME,,,">This is how most open source software companies make money. This usually includes some horrendous subscription fee and guaranteed SLAs.\nI never quite understood, why this works. My only explanation is, that many customers are comfortable with this, because this is what they are used to from buying proprietary software.<p>I think Jonathan Schwartz had a decent answer to this question.  It was basically that there are two types of customers, the kind with more time than money, and the kind with more money than time.  If your company stands to lose thousands of dollars for an hour of downtime, minutes, isn't paying a subscription fee with 24 hour support worth it, even if it's almost never utilized?<p>Another way to make money is to backport bug fixes to previous versions that customers are on.  With companies who have more time than money, this won't bother them, they can compile their own versions and do their own merges of bug fixes.  For companies making boatloads of cash, why waste developer effort doing this for a negligible fee?",1302555304

The Nature paper uses light microscopy and patch clamping a sample of neurons (caveat -- haven't had a chance to read the paper yet) while Seung's group works on methods to trace electron microscopy, which is significantly higher res than light microscopy.  You can see individual synapses (e.g., the T-bars and post-synaptic densities) in EM images while the light microscopy guys need another method to establish true connectivity versus physical proximity, hence the patch clamping.  Ideally, you'd be able to tell whether two neurons are connected to each other by looking at high-res images -- see the T-bar, lots of vesicles with neurotransmitters, the post-synaptic densities on neighboring neurons.  The gold standard, though, is to be able to electrically establish connectivity.  You just can't do that gold standard for the vast number of neurons in the brains.",1302555011

It took me about 6 months before I really understood a lot of things (object oriented programming, in particular took a long time to grok). I mostly started with the goal of being able to knock together some little gui fronted databases and other things that would make my life a little easier. Now I mostly fart around with Django, javascript and Java (Android). I'm also learning C because I realize that I have a lot of holes in my fundamentals.<p>I don't want to discourage you, but I think that there are a huge number of roadblocks to creating a disruptive start-up that we usually see on HN in the medical world. Firstly, doctors are not the folks who are making the decisions about health care IT. The hospital IT depts are running that show, and in my limited experience they have no interest in supporting open-source or services that don't come with a big support contract. They would like to be able to point the finger to an outside company if things go south. Secondly, HIPAA and HITECH are going to be a big problem for small medical startups. A single breach or unauthorized disclosure or security hole is going to potentially sink your business.<p>I would encourage you to learn to code.

I also (despite having created HireFire) still have use-cases for SimpleWorker, however in my case they will likely be for my VPS' rather than on Heroku. On Heroku (even though there isn't a UI, unless you use Resque), it's already a partially managed service to host workers, it runs from the same compiled slug as the dyno's use so all the credentials / env variables are all shared among dyno's and workers, no need to re-apply configuration and such.<p>I think for me the hardest part was getting it to work the first time, waiting quite a while for the jobs to run to see if I managed to get it to work.

This approach actually makes a lot of sense in the smartphone/tablet market, especially with all the multi-core chips coming out.<p>It's true that the bare minimum that a codec <i>needs</i> to do is take an input bytestream and output it to the various output(video and audio) bytestreams.  So, for a hardware accelerated video, this is pretty simple-all you need to do is pipe your input stream to the hardware, and that will handle all the magic of getting it directly out to the screens and speakers.  However, for non-native hardware accelerated codecs(i.e. not H.264 or MPEG-2), this process involves a lot more hardware and software to actually get something to the screen.<p>The non-native hardware accelerated codecs need access to(at a bare minimum) the sound and video system APIs.   Unless the codec developers are certifiably insane, the codec will be using DirectX(for Windows) or OpenGL(for everything else) to handle the actual writing to the screen, especially if you want to use the video hardware for faster decoding.  While it's possible for browsers to wrap those API calls, it just makes a lot more effort on all developers involved, and doesn't really get you much security at the expense of both complexity and performance.  So it makes sense for any codec to have access to the lower level APIs for displaying things to the screen.<p>Sandboxing the process should be possible for the file inputs, but I'm not sure if it's really possible for file outputs in the cases where the codec is using a system-level API.<p>EDIT: After reading what I wrote, this is a good argument for the browsers themselves wrapping the codecs and placing them into a sandbox.  Unfortunately, that will never happen, because of the legal minefield that almost all have right now...",1302552674

I would be less conflicted, I think, if Apple products really did ""just work"" as so many Apple adherents purport. But from my experience, it's just a matter of degree, i.e. Apple products ""just work"" more often than MS products do, but not that much more often anymore, and when Apple products don't work, they don't work harder (or maybe it just feels that way because people have so little experience trying to get non-working things to work?).<p>On a more abstract level, it just feels weird and maybe subversive to characterize the restriction of choice as freedom. I mean, it does make a sort of sense, esp. after taking human psychology into account in that restricting choice to a manageable level might make it easier for people to make decisions. But it still feels weird. Maybe it just exposes ""freedom"" as a flawed concept, and a tense balance between orders of magnitude-larger forces is all there is. That's a weird Lovecraftian world to live in, though.",1302552006

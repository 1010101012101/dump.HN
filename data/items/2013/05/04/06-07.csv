5654309,comment,5653531,5653531,20,0,nikcub,,,"Interesting coincidence. One of my own 'seeing the future' moments also came from OTOY. We were sitting in the Techcrunch house late on Friday afternoon and there wasn't a lot going on. We got an email in our tips mailbox from Jules, the founder and CEO of OTOY explaining that he was in San Francisco up from LA for the weekend presenting at a conference, where he had a booth setup.<p>He sent us some info on what OTOY was working on, something about graphics processors in a server setup that could stream games to any client. We didn't really understand what he was talking about, since 'cloud' and all that wasn't well defined at the time (this was in '08, IIRC), but there was enough there to pique our interest. We emailed back asking if we could see him that afternoon, and he said that shouldn't be a problem - he was setting the booth up that evening before the conference proper started on the weekend, and it might be the best time since it was quiet there.<p>We drove up, found his tiny booth - the smallest of the lot, in a dark corner, next to the much larger rooms being setup by ATI, NVidia etc. He had one screen, one PC, a couple of phones and a pocket PC (believe it was an iPaq). He plugged a playstation controller into the PC, opened up the OTOY gaming application and scrolled around a half-dozen or so games on the screen while he explained what was happening.<p>NVidia had built a server-side GPU cluster which they were trialling out. It was a number of servers each with a dozen or two GPU's built into them which would directly stream their output over the internet (compressed) to the client. He fired up Grand Theft Auto 3 and we watched him while he walked around the city, getting into cars, driving around and then hitting top speed over hills etc. while the framerate didn't miss a beat.<p>The debug stats in the top corner showed that he was using 60-80KB/sec of bandwidth while playing. He explained that each frame was being sent down over the internet from a co-lo center. The ping time was 15ms, meaning there wasn't much lag. The servers were processing the input, playing the game, and then sending the output back. The codec in the prototype was nothing more than a series of JPEG images sent at 15-60+ frames per second. They said then that they would have something much better than that at some point, and I guess this Javascript + WebGL is what he was referring to.<p>We still weren't super impressed, since he had a controller and a big screen, so he just as well could have been running a playstation or other console underneath the table.<p>But then he picked up one of the phones, opened a Java applet and connected to the same game. This time I held the phone while he controlled the player and we had this tiny phone that could not have had more processing power than an early 386 playing one of the newest computer games on the market at the time in full color, at full screen and at full speed. Totally and completely blown away. He switched in and out of other games within seconds.<p>The next demo was opening up a web browser, pointing it to the web address, then watching the same game render in ~30 fps as the browser pulled down JPEG images and refreshed with JPEG (again, the very simple 'codec'). Utterly amazing.<p>We ended up spending hours with him, while he explained their plans and how the future of gaming will all be server-side. Since then, I have seen the OTOY name come up again and again related to breakthroughs in cloud-based gaming. These guys are really smart, and really ambitious.<p>Techcrunch ended up writing up an intro to what we saw a couple of months later (the conference was a private conference, IIRC, and our meeting was off-the-record, if I remember correctly).<p>The reason why we didn't publish everything right away was because I was very skeptical about some of the claims. He was a very good salesperson, and it is always difficult to distinguish those who are smart and sales savvy but have substance, and those who are just full of shit. Jules and OTOY were definitely the former.<p>In terms of my questions, I was most concerned about the lag issue and how this would work with users around the world who couldn't be near servers. I went back and forward on tech issues for a while on email until I was very convinced that not only was this possible, but it was almost certainly the future of gaming (why have all these GPU's that can't be upgraded on desktops and in consoles when you can place them all in the cloud - better utilization, better upgrade path, better pricing - eg. all the cloud benefits).<p>Here is the later story Techcrunch wrote:<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/09/otoy-developing-server-side-3d-rendering-technology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/09/otoy-developing-server-side...</a><p>Here are all the OTOY stories at Techcrunch from the past 6 years, you can see the things they have been working on:<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/09/otoy-developing-server-side-3d-rendering-technology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/09/otoy-developing-server-side...</a>",1367650381

They look primarily at recent prices and the best ask and bid, and secondarily at the top 5 or so bids and asks. If you put an order that's double of the last price, it will be far away from those top 5. And it's very unlikely that your order is going to be matched any time soon even if the stock moves up (some exchanges actually suspend trading of a symbol before its price can rise by 100% in one day).<p>Theoretically, it could work for illiquid stocks, but even then it's not trivial to do since 1) people will still look at historical prices, 2) it's risky, since it costs money to setup and you have no guarantee anyone will fall into your trap; because the stock is illiquid, it might cost you money to undo the setup 3) it's considered illegal market manipulation in some (most?) places, and you can easily get caught.",1367649992

C. Penney in November 2011, succeeding Mike Ullman who had served as CEO for the past 7 years. Ullman then served as chairman of the board of directors but was relieved of his duties in January 2012. Bill Ackman, a J. C. Penney board member and head of hedge fund Pershing Square, had strongly supported bringing in Johnson to shakeup the store’s stodgy image and attract new customers. Johnson was awarded $52.7 million when he joined J. C. Penney, plus he made a $50 million personal investment in the company. After being hired, Johnson tipped Michael Kramer, an Apple Store veteran, as COO while firing many existing J.C. Penney executives.[7][8] [8]<p>When Johnson announced his transformation vision in late January 2012, J. C. Penney’s stock rose 24 percent to $43.[9] Johnson's actual execution, however, was described ""one of the most aggressively unsuccessful tenures in retail history"". While his rebranding effort was ambitious, he was said to have ""had no idea about allocating and conserving resources and core customers. He made promises neither his stores nor his cash flows would allow him to keep"". Similar to what he had done at Apple, Johnson did not consider a staged roll-out, instead he ""immediately rejected everything existing customers believed about the chain and stuffed it in their faces"" with the first major TV ad campaign under his watch. Johnson defended his strategy saying that ""testing would have been impossible because the company needed quick results and that if he hadn’t taken a strong stance against discounting, he would not have been able to get new, stylish brands on board.""[10] [11]<p>Many initiatives that made the Apple Store successful, for instance the ""thought that people would show up in stores because they were fun places to hang out, and that they would buy things listed at full-but-fair price"" did not work for the J.C. Penney brand and ending up alienated its aging customers who were used to heavy discounting. Johnson himself was said ""to have a disdain for JC Penney’s traditional customer base. When shoppers weren’t reacting positively to the disappearance of coupons and sales, Johnson didn’t blame the new policies. Instead, he offered the arrogant assessment that customers needed to be “educated” as to how the new pricing strategy worked. He also likened the coupons beloved by so many core shoppers as drugs that customers needed to be weaned off.""[12][13][9]<p>While head of J. C. Penney, Johnson continued to live in California and commuted to work in Plano, Texas by private jet several days a week.[14]<p>On April 8, 2013 he was fired as the CEO of J. C. Penney and replaced by his predecessor, Mike Ullman.[15] Johnson was dismissed after his ""bold new pricing strategies clearly failed, but before being able to bring his “shop-in-shop” strategy to fruition"", as the board of directors was reportedly Johnson's costly ambitious turnaround plan. The “mini-shops” in Penney stores featuring hot brands, that just opened last year, were doing better than the rest of the store.[16]",1367649690

The tank removes (sensory deprivation) the distractions you normally get with standard sitting meditation. Therefore all that is left (feels like) is your mind floating in space.

5654212,comment,5653706,5654144,4,0,wycats,,,"There are several reasons I chose not to use HAL:<p>* HAL embeds child documents recursively, while JSON API flattens the entire graph of objects at the top level. This means that if the same ""people"" are referenced from different kinds of objects (say, the author of both posts and comments), this format ensures that there is only a single representation of each person document in the payload.<p>* Similarly, JSON API uses IDs for linkage, which makes it possible to cache documents from compound responses and then limit subsequent requests to only the documents that aren't already present locally. If you're lucky, this can even completely eliminate HTTP requests.<p>* HAL is a serialization format, but says nothing about how to update documents. JSON API thinks through how to update existing records (leaning on PATCH and JSON Patch), and how those updates interact with compound documents returned from GET requests. It also describes how to create and delete documents, and what 200 and 204 responses from those updates mean.<p>In short, JSON API is an attempt to formalize similar ad hoc client-server interfaces that use JSON as an interchange format. It is specifically focused around using those APIs with a smart client that knows how to cache documents it has already seen and avoid asking for them again.<p>It is extracted from a real-world library already used by a number of projects, which has informed both the request/response aspects (absent from HAL) and the interchange format itself.",1367648058

Indeed, the semantics of a to-many relationship need to be set-like (in order to avoid nasty concurrent modification issues), but people really wanted the ability to return an array and have it ""work as expected"". In general, the right way to handle position, imho, is to use a `position` attribute and sort on the client. After saying all of that, perhaps this is a good reason to use ID indices, so people don't get the wrong idea.<p>I'll sleep on it :)",1367647335

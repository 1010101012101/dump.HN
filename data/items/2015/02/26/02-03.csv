Some hosted wallets let you set up recurring payments. This is awesome because unlike credit cards, you don&#x27;t have to give the merchant authorization to debit your money, but you give this authorization only to the wallet hoster. This gives the merchant zero chances to screw you up (eg. continuing to debit your card when you want it to stop, or setting up a recurring payment disclosed in the fine print when you think you are authorizing a one-time payment.)<p>> It works for a restaurant but that&#x27;s a very special case<p>This scenario covers literally ALL in-person transactions. Hardly a &quot;very special case&quot;.<p>> But the kind of person who gets their credit card PIN stolen (which is what we were comparing to) isn&#x27;t going to have a well-protected private key.<p>No we were comparing typical users. A security conscious credit card user can STILL get his number stolen and money stolen (eg. a merchant gets hacked). Whereas a security conscious Bitcoin user using a hardware wallet is virtually impervious to being attacked (only highly sophisticated hacks like stealing the hardware wallet and decaping the secure chip to steal the private keys without knowing the PIN).<p>Some users are so bad with security and detecting scams that they will always get their money stolen (regardless if they use credit cards or bitcoins).",1424918981

9111002,comment,9108849,9108849,0,0,antognini,,,"To put this result in context, an important open question in astronomy is how supermassive black holes are formed.  There are currently two viable formation mechanisms:<p>1. The bottom-up model: After the first generation of star formation, the most massive stars formed black holes with masses somewhere between 10-100 solar masses.  These then began accreting material and merging with each other and gradually grew into the supermassive black holes we see today.<p>2. The direct collapse model: As galaxies were forming, there was generally a concentration of gas at the bottom of each galaxy&#x27;s potential well.  If this cloud were dense enough, under the right conditions it could collapse directly into a ~10^4-10^6 solar mass black hole without fragmenting into individual stars.<p>The bottom-up model has historically been considered more plausible because the physics involved is better understood.  However, discoveries of very massive black holes very early in the lifetime of the universe are starting to pose very serious challenges for this model.  The reason is that black holes cannot grow arbitrarily rapidly.  The rate at which a black hole can accrete matter is limited by the &quot;Eddington accretion rate&quot; or the &quot;Eddington limit.&quot;  Above the Eddington limit the gas gets so hot as it accretes onto the black hole that radiation from the infalling gas blows away the rest of the gas.  (There are many details in this process which I have glossed over, but suffice to say it&#x27;s generally difficult to get an accretion rate that is much more than this limit.)<p>If you start out with a black hole with a mass of ~100 solar masses and you feed it constantly at the Eddington limit, you can just barely grow black holes large enough to power the quasars we see in the early universe.  But as more distant and more massive black holes are discovered, it gets harder and harder to grow a stellar mass black hole into a supermassive black hole in the age that the universe has existed at that time, and you have to invoke mechanisms like super-Eddington accretion and black hole mergers to grow a large enough black hole.  This may be possible for individual black holes, but the more fine-tuned the model becomes, the less likely it is to be the primary channel by which supermassive black holes form.  These sorts of discoveries are therefore providing evidence that the simple bottom-up picture may not be correct and either super-Eddington accretion, mergers, or direct collapse is necessary to form these black holes.",1424918438

Based on my understanding of it, that new theory predicts that the Universe has always existed, by doing away with the singularity prior to inflation ([0] for some information on inflation). But it does not really affect our understanding of what happens post-inflation. The post-inflation period is when quantum fluctuations are amplified by gravity, resulting in the formation of structure[1].<p>To be a bit more specific, the relevant time interval for this Nature paper is between when dark matter halos began collapsing and when this quasar turned on, not the interval between the start of the Universe until the quasar turned on. However, in the currently-favored cosmology, the &quot;start&quot; of the Universe is followed very rapidly by the onset of structure formation, so the two are effectively the same point in time (at least, for the purposes of supermassive black hole formation and growth). As it relates to this Nature paper, the theory you reference merely separates the &quot;start&quot; of the Universe from the onset of structure formation, so it doesn&#x27;t affect the relevant time interval for this particular question.<p>> I always new that there was a relationship between black holes and quasars (In/Out) but was unaware that there was an established relationship between specific events. Does anyone have links to this ?<p>It isn&#x27;t so much a link between specific times as a limit on how quickly you can grow a black hole. The formation of supermassive black holes is fairly uncertain[2], but models generally predict that you start with a black hole that is 1–100 times the mass of the Sun and then grow it by accreting gas. There&#x27;s a limit to how quickly you can accrete gas[3], so there&#x27;s a limit to how quickly you can grow the black hole. If you put those two things together, there isn&#x27;t enough time elapsed between the onset of structure formation and this newly discovered quasar was active, with such a high mass black hole.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_%28cosmology%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_%28cosmology%29</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole#Formation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole#Format...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_luminosity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_luminosity</a><p><i>Edit</i>: modified wording for clarity.",1424918163

The big challenge we found was that it takes a lot of effort to make a new (micro)service. We need to create a system of alarms (instead of relying on existing catch all defaults).

We needed to think about how the dependent service would authenticate against the new service.  All of that on top of the core feature work.<p>All these things are good. You want isolated, focused test environments. You want tightly defined alarms. However we underestimated how long creating a new service would take.

The problem is even worse when you look outside of academia at common practices in more applied settings.<p>As suggested, a good approach is to take p-values not as conclusive or decisive, but rather as a tool that must be supplemented by other statistics. In particular, the article emphasizes Bayesian methods, which can certainly provide additional information, but this approach can also be rather limited when priors are not well-defined or are entirely unknown, which is unfortunately often the case in many problem domains.<p>One potential question is how to determine the nature of the distinction mentioned in the conclusion between &quot;preliminary research&quot; and &quot;confirmatory research&quot;, particularly in cases where statistics provide the primary evidence, as in, e.g. psychology. Further studies in the same vein as the preliminary research can certainly provide additional supporting statistical evidence, but this doesn&#x27;t escape the problem that all of the evidence is probabilistic in nature. The key issue here is that since statistical approaches can only give probabilistic evidence that a hypothesis is correct, then they strictly cannot tell you what is certainly true, so even confirmatory research is quite open to falsification. So we wouldn&#x27;t want the label of &quot;confirmatory research&quot; to somehow suggest to the public the idea that it is certainly correct.",1424917700

9110928,comment,9110928,9110927,0,0,johnmarinelli,,,"This is a really simple Angular app that is really a glorified frontend for the Github API.  The goal was to find open source projects that are still in early stages of development, so beginners could get used to the workflow of actually contributing to repositories.  I know this was (and to an extent, still is) a problem for me when I first started with git; I could make and manipulate my own repos, but when it came to actually socializing/working together with other programmers via Github I had no idea where to start, and most repositories I found were dead or were too advanced for me.<p>The app simply takes in a keyword and a language; by default it will only search for repositories that were last updated two weeks ago (so you know it&#x27;s still alive), with less than 10 stars and 3 forks (so you know that there&#x27;s still some room for contributers).  Of course, you can edit these parameters yourself.<p>Anyway, it was firstly a playground for Angular.  As far as that goes, I really like it so far but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to put it aside for now because of work/school.",1424916456

Code reviews are not more &quot;reflective&quot; than pairing.<p>PRs, as implemented by nearly everyone, are a failure.  The only way to review a PR is to check out the branch and look at the entire context of the patch, not just the diff.  For that matter, it requires the reviewer to <i>understand</i> the code that is being changed. The reviewer needs to more or less independently solve the problem.  It is possible to do this review after the fact, or while the code is being written - in either case, the same knowledge is required.<p>In practice, everywhere I&#x27;ve ever worked, &quot;good enough&quot; nearly always gets merged - slightly better methods don&#x27;t tend to make it back into the PRs for a million reasons.

Those are the two supports the solar industry loves in the USA. Without them, solar has to pay for itself in the most brutal way by just making electricity usage cheaper house by house.<p>I wonder @JGreenberger where the most exciting region is to promote household solar, whether larger collective or unidad habitacional installations are viable, and whether there is any kind of subsidy or reverse tariff arrangement to promote solar use.",1424916216

9110909,comment,9104060,9108081,0,0,warfangle,,,"> fining people for indecency<p>On broadcast airways. The logic was that owners of broadcast receivers should be able to prevent indecent/obscene material from entering their home if they so wished. But due to the nature of broadcast media it was often impossible to know if, while flipping through channels, you might end up on something you did not wish to see. These were not televisions you could type a channel number in to; these were not digital radios that enabled the removal of channels you did not want. It sucks, but has absolutely no bearing on the internet (please to be reading through the telecommunications act. As legalize goes, it&#x27;s not that bad).<p>> requiring auto-blocking &#x27;v-chips&#x27; in TVs<p>Auto-blocking? Please expound. From my understanding, v-chips give the owner of the television the ability to censor the television broadcasts entering their home. The FCC, in this case, wasn&#x27;t censoring - it was giving the option to television owners to censor. The best outcome would have been the requirement for televisions to have the v-chip installed, and removing the indecency fine authority. It&#x27;s too bad it didn&#x27;t work out that way. Keep in mind that cable television is also regulated under the TCA - see U.S.C. 47 ch 5 subchapter V-A<p>> enforce encryption bans<p>How? Without, you know, violating a plethora of privacy laws.<p>> national domain blacklists<p>How? The FBI can already seize domains, anyhow. Title II does not give the FCC the authority to operate a domain registrar.<p>> mandatory packet inspection/retention<p>Not really. The law (have you read the TCA?) <i>requires</i> that communications _not_ be inspected - by the FCC _or_ the telecoms.<p>> Why build up the idea of FCC as the Internet&#x27;s keeper<p>Because the market is doing a shit job of it. Once upon a time, DSL was classified under Title II. Speeds increased over time. In 2005, it was reclassified. And speeds have been stagnant ever since, even though there is DSL technology that can provide over 200Mbps.<p>> But with utility-style regulation, agency staff regularly review and approve – or fine! – business activity.<p>Like when they fined that hotel for jamming wifi networks? That kind of fine? Or when they fined long distance phone companies for billing customers for services without their authorization? Or when they fined AT&T for operating fixed point-to-point microwave stations without authorization or license? Or when they fined Viacom and ESPN for misuse of Emergency Alert System warning tones? Or fined a company in Alabama for pre-recorded sales calls? Or fined Worldwide Industrial Enterprises for faxing 17 unsolicited advertisements? Or fined TerraCom and YourTel for failure to protect their customer&#x27;s information? Or when they fined T-Mobile for hearing aid compatibility violations? Or cited RGS Group for illegally selling Wifi and cell phone jammers?<p>Which of these was nefarious?<p>All of them could have been challenged in court.<p>Even the rules they adopt can be challenged in court. See, for example: Verizon V. FCC.<p>> Regulators apply a larger body of vaguer rules, that they can change themselves<p>They can change them, yes. That&#x27;s what the FCC is doing now. However, the FCC -- like all independent regulatory bodies - has procedures for changing the rules. And those procedures include a period of public comment. They don&#x27;t change them in secret and on whim. Do some research: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_of_proposed_rulemaking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_of_proposed_rulemaking</a><p>> and where usual presumptions-of-innocence or evidential[sic] standards don&#x27;t apply.<p>Presumptions of innocence are not a part of civil law, either - only criminal law. When the FCC decides to fine someone, they issue a Notice of Apparent Liability and Order. The entity receiving this order is given 30 days to either pay the proposed fine or respond in writing. One of the ways they can respond is by filing a lawsuit/injunction against the FCC.<p>> the need to keep regulators happy nudges companies into &quot;voluntary&quot; compliance with political agendas, like default filtering for a &quot;safer internet&quot;, or casual &quot;information sharing&quot; with law-enforcement for &quot;cyber-security&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s easier to do that with a senator or representative that needs to run for re-election, isn&#x27;t it... and laws that don&#x27;t have a mandatory period of public comment before being signed are a lot easier to craft secretly.<p>> default filtering<p>Given that default filtering of the internet, if broadband providers were regulated under Title II, would be illegal...<p>> casual &quot;information sharing&quot; with law-enforcement [...]<p>This already happens. If anything, Title II would _reduce_ said casual information sharing, because it codifies how said sharing should happen.

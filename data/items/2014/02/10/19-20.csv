7213317,comment,7212804,7212804,32,0,aestra,,,"I&#x27;m just going to leave this here for further discussion.<p><a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/why-parents-may-cause-gender-differences-kids-79501"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/why-parents-may-cause-gender-differe...</a><p>In one, scientists dressed newborns in gender-neutral clothes and misled adults about their sex. The adults described the &quot;boys&quot; (actually girls) as angry or distressed more often than did adults who thought they were observing girls, and described the &quot;girls&quot; (actually boys) as happy and socially engaged more than adults who knew the babies were boys. Dozens of such disguised-gender experiments have shown that adults perceive baby boys and girls differently, seeing identical behavior through a gender-tinted lens. In another study, mothers estimated how steep a slope their 11-month-olds could crawl down. Moms of boys got it right to within one degree; moms of girls underestimated what their daughters could do by nine degrees, even though there are no differences in the motor skills of infant boys and girls. But that prejudice may cause parents to unconsciously limit their daughter&#x27;s physical activity. How we perceive children—sociable or remote, physically bold or reticent—shapes how we treat them and therefore what experiences we give them. Since life leaves footprints on the very structure and function of the brain, these various experiences produce sex differences in adult behavior and brains—the result not of innate and inborn nature but of nurture.<p>For her new book, Pink Brain, Blue Brain: How Small Differences Grow Into Troublesome Gaps—And What We Can Do About It, Eliot immersed herself in hundreds of scientific papers (her bibliography runs 46 pages). Marching through the claims like Sherman through Georgia, she explains that assertions of innate sex differences in the brain are either &quot;blatantly false,&quot; &quot;cherry-picked from single studies,&quot; or &quot;extrapolated from rodent research&quot; without being confirmed in people. For instance, the idea that the band of fibers connecting the right and left brain is larger in women, supposedly supporting their more &quot;holistic&quot; thinking, is based on a single 1982 study of only 14 brains. Fifty other studies, taken together, found no such sex difference—not in adults, not in newborns. Other baseless claims: that women are hard-wired to read faces and tone of voice, to defuse conflict, and to form deep friendships; and that &quot;girls&#x27; brains are wired for communication and boys&#x27; for aggression.&quot; Eliot&#x27;s inescapable conclusion: there is &quot;little solid evidence of sex differences in children&#x27;s brains.&quot;<p>Yet there are differences in adults&#x27; brains, and here Eliot is at her most original and persuasive: explaining how they arise from tiny sex differences in infancy. For instance, baby boys are more irritable than girls. That makes parents likely to interact less with their &quot;nonsocial&quot; sons, which could cause the sexes&#x27; developmental pathways to diverge. By 4 months of age, boys and girls differ in how much eye contact they make, and differences in sociability, emotional expressivity, and verbal ability—all of which depend on interactions with parents—grow throughout childhood. The message that sons are wired to be nonverbal and emotionally distant thus becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The sexes &quot;start out a little bit different&quot; in fussiness, says Eliot, and parents &quot;react differently to them,&quot; producing the differences seen in adults.<p>Those differences also arise from gender conformity. You often see the claim that toy preferences—trucks or dolls—appear so early, they must be innate. But as Eliot points out, 6- and 12-month-olds of both sexes prefer dolls to trucks, according to a host of studies. Children settle into sex-based play preferences only around age 1, which is when they grasp which sex they are, identify strongly with it, and conform to how they see other, usually older, boys or girls behaving. &quot;Preschoolers are already aware of what&#x27;s acceptable to their peers and what&#x27;s not,&quot; writes Eliot. Those play preferences then snowball, producing brains with different talents.",1392062387

I don&#x27;t spend my time worrying about Facebook, so I haven&#x27;t looked into their ad technology in any depth. Nonetheless, everything in the above video strikes me as spot on, which would also mean that I was exactly right.

Gox today:<p>1. Allow all transactions to go through as before, but state clearly that if your transaction does not go through after being submitted, it will take a long time to clear the transaction, because it will have to be checked by hand. Assuming that 90% of people are not planning to scam Mt. Gox, 90% of people would be able to get their money. The remaining 10% would have to wait a bit longer while Mt. Gox checks transactions by hand.<p>2. Alternatively, write a system were a user can request to withdraw bitcoins. The Mt. Gox server first generates a new wallet, than transfers the BTC to that wallet, than send the user the public and private keys for that wallet. Assuming that the user (for good reason) does not trust Mt. Gox, they than can simply transfer the BTC from a temporary wallet to a permanent one.",1392060880

This leads to heavy reliance on highly attributable channels like AdWords since you can target people who have expressed high purchase intent. What most companies don&#x27;t do is look closely at multi-channel attribution models and look at how multiple exposures across different media types change purchase behavior. Perhaps someone who is exposed to two display ad driven messages prior to seeing your Google ad is 2x more likely to click and 4x more likely to purchase vs. just being exposed to your Google ad alone. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what you will see, but you should be curious to understand those effects.<p>We tend to generalize based on our own experiences. I also don&#x27;t think Facebook ads work well in many cases but I also can see brands that are doing a great job or run innovative campaigns that get their message across effectively so I know Facebook works if you get it right.

Extensive process might raise the below average toward the average, but it can also lower the above average toward the average.<p>Twice I&#x27;ve seen situations where a team of better than average developers had no really well-defined process (though not surprisingly a sort of home grown process evolved to suit everyone&#x27;s needs -- agile, as opposed to Agile, if you will) that was highly productive suddenly have process dropped on them from on-high in an undeniably productivity-killing way.<p>One time it was because higher-ups at the company randomly decided they needed to standardize on the Rational tools (ClearCase, Rose, etc... still have nightmares about that stuff) and out of that insane decision we ended up with some stupidly strictly defined RUP-based process to tie everything together.<p>The other was when a team was transitioned from one company to another and the other was one of those stupidly-strict &quot;Agile&quot; shops that fully drank the ritual kool-aid and adopted basically every suggested &quot;Agile&quot; strategy they could slap together without giving much thought to the actual original ideals of why &quot;Agile&quot; came about.<p>I guess the takeaway is be really selective about introducing new process.  It might entirely make sense if your project is building some mostly throwaway CRUD app for an internal company department and all of your developers are, well, the kind of developers you can find who will work on such things and the project is off-track.  Or even if your developers are all good, but the project is failing for other reasons like lack of cohesive vision.  A little bit of process introduced sparingly might help.<p>But if you have a highly productive team already, don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking that because process &quot;improves&quot; software development that adding more of it will make your highly productive team even more productive.

Want to open a word document as an attachment? You have to flip to a <i>completely different UI</i> parallel and barely interoperable UI to do it. Even a lot of the basic settings were duplicated incompletely between the two worlds (I haven&#x27;t tried Windows 8.1 myself, so I don&#x27;t know).

However for this to be plausible, you need to be able to ship without the desktop, which means Office needs to be Metro-friendly. The stop-gap of shipping with both Metro and the traditional desktop is a fatal <i>execution</i> flaw in what&#x27;s otherwise a reasonably sound design.<p>A better, technically possible, solution would be to open Win32 apps as full screen apps within Metro, and allow the usual tiling and app switching.

My understanding was that ebook prices were being set by the publisher&#x27;s.<p>I think now overall there are more instances of price differentiation, but usually B&N still matches Amazon.",1392059080

If we can remove the barrier to getting the code up and running we believe more people will get access and use innovative scientific code.<p>The competition between labs is an interesting point. In a non- academic world we would see competition as good: better  results, algorithm optimizations etc. Sadly I can see this as a deterrent to publishing code in the academic world though.",1392059067

It allows people to look at different options and the user can use someone else&#x27;s hint or they can create their own (but they can&#x27;t create their own deck).

It is way simpler to grasp the modes if a single key is required to switch.

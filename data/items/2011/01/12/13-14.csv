It took a legal struggle and legislation to enshrine the rights of ownership that car owners take for granted.<p>Or at least <i>took</i> for granted. A new legal struggle is turning around the right to repair modern cars that make extensive use of processors and proprietary software.<p><a href=""http://blog.fosketts.net/2010/07/29/walled-gardens-gilded-cages-repair/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fosketts.net/2010/07/29/walled-gardens-gilded-ca...</a>",1294840784

With a dual drive you could do fancy things like make backup copies, without having to repeatedly store data to RAM and swap source and destination floppies.  In the 1980s home computers typically didn't have enough memory to store the entire contents of a floppy disk in RAM, which made the process of creating backups irksome if you didn't have a dual drive.<p>If you've only started using Windows based computers within the last five years then the missing A and B drives may seem mysterious.

The Human Interface Guidelines are clear and specific on how to do most things. Cocoa's APIs and the Interface Builder make it far easier to follow the conventions than to reinvent the wheel. There is absolutely a right way and a wrong way to implement most UI features in Mac software. The criticisms in RTFHIG aren't simply that the apps featured are ugly, but that they do things that Apple explicitly states that you shouldn't do in a Mac app. Doing it the right way requires nothing more than the willingness to read and follow the explicit instructions given in the HIGs. I have absolutely no respect for anyone who has so little respect for software.<p>Writing software is unquestionably difficult, there is a great deal to learn and most developers have a long adolescence before they start writing really good software. It's also true however that the proliferation of bad software has serious negative externalities on the developer community. It feels absolutely terrible to submit a lovingly-crafted piece of software to an app store only to see it swamped by thoughtless, careless crapware. We would be foolish to ignore the importance of signal-to-noise and the ability of noise to render a communications channel useless.

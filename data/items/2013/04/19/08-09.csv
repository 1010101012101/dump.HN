Let me restate that again: programming is NOT math.<p>OOP works and is a paradigm because people can relate to objects and narrative best. It has much more to do with narrative and story. The word ""language"" is by design. Good OOP techniques can create great products.<p>Whatever the code is, unless you're writing machine language, eventually, you compile to or run bits of existing machine code. The important part is encapsulating the complexity. OOP or not, that's should be the goal of any module. Not all the details are important all of the time. In fact, it's generally much more important to hide details so one can deal with large systems in an abstract way. In many cases, details are unavailable and black box systems have to be dealt with. The point is logical abstractions, not details, are the goal here.<p>Just because you can write it in machine language doesn't mean you should.",1366361773

We all know and hate those apps. But is there any reason to jump to the other extreme and turn as much as possible into ""pure"" $LANGUAGE ?<p>As soon as your query gets moderately complicated, you're still littering Python with SQL keywords like order_by(), desc(), select(), and commit(). The GROUP BY section of the documentation just reads like a rough translation of SQL into Python, the only difference being the syntax. It's like watching a first-week ESL student try to construct sentences in English.<p>The documentation advertises that ""Pony allows any programmer to write complex and effective queries against a database, even without being an expert in SQL."" I don't think this is true for any ORM I've seen so far, whether in Python or in any other popular language. Beyond a certain level of complexity, you need to know SQL in order to write complex queries. But if you already know SQL, why translate long GROUP BY ... HAVING queries into Python only to have the ORM translate it back into SQL? Why are we trying so hard to avoid writing SQL? What are we going to do next? Write a library that translates pure Python into Lua scripts for your Redis server?<p>I like ORMs because they simplify frequent tasks, like grabbing a dozen items from the database and filtering them by a couple of columns. I also like them because they often come with caching and effective protections against SQL injection attacks. But I also think that purity is overrated. Both web apps and native apps are already a mixture of several different languages, both on the frontend and on the backend.

Joel Spolsky talked a bit about administration as creating ""abstraction layers"", and what's happening here seems like <i>tiered administration</i> (which I guess is a working definition of <i>bureaucracy</i>). In other words, the administration themselves are isolating themselves, by means of more administration, from the ""realities on the ground"", which creates this tension between the people who really <i>understand</i> what's involved and the people who <i>commit</i> to involving the company.<p>So we shouldn't say ""it's just up to the employee"", because that attitude creates its own culture, one where the employees work just enough to not get fired and the management accepts this attitude as network damage and routes work around it.<p>Administrations have an opportunity to choose what they're doing. Advising a startup-laden forum like HN to aspire to massively-multiplayer mediocrity might not be wise, because startups exist in a high-failure environment and must strive for passion and excellence. It's the right culture for very large corporations and for franchise restaurants, but it's the wrong culture for the deli down the corner.<p>Surprisingly, I don't think the solution must require ""giving up control"" as a developer-manager, though that will certainly help. If you look at these stories, there is a perverse sense of <i>alienation</i> from the company. Maybe this metaphor helps: the manager should be <i>conducting an orchestra</i>. The conductor doesn't have to give up control of the whole orchestra necessarily, but they do need to be aware that it's a bunch of individual people, and you need to communicate your vision of the music you're playing, and they need to feel the same vision and work with you to express it. You also need to forgive errors in performance rather than stop the orchestra for every little thing, and you need to let the audience applaud everyone when success finally happens, and everyone needs to hear the whole symphony, their parts and everybody else's, to know what's going on. In this way, you could in some sense ""keep control"" even though you give up micromanaging.",1366358976

When you sign up with our app, you choose two charities - one that you like and one that you don't - and if you stick to your commitments, we send your money on (minus our overhead fee) to the one you like. If you don't stick to your commitment, we send your money to the other one.<p>I see this as a great bit of market validation.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/culturestate/promise-fit-slideshare"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/culturestate/promise-fit-slideshar...</a>",1366358691

It has been my experience that good producers are more likely to be asked to continue to produce.<p>In principle this is not even a bad thing. A great software engineer might not be that great as a manager or CEO.<p>It would be better to have a technical career track where you advance in pay, in status items (car, single office) or other perks (conference visits payed by the company). And of course a truely great company would send you on extra holiday for all-nighters and weekend-rush jobs.",1366358617

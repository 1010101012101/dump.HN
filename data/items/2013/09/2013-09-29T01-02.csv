You trade increased development time for higher quality software.<p>I think it&#x27;s quite bizarre to be arguing that TDD is not agile when it is an explicitly agile methodology. Kent Beck, the inventor of TDD, is an author of the agile manifesto that you quote. The authors of the document clearly disagree with your interpretation of it.<p>>You should first try stuff out and discuss it rather than working out how to machine test it before its been tried by a human. Having tests first is clearly having a plan first.<p>This is a strawman argument. TDD does not imply working out how to machine test something before it&#x27;s been discussed and planned by a human. If you need to try it agile has a concept of spikes. This is not an argument against TDD because this does not describe TDD.<p>>It&#x27;s hard-enough to welcome changing requirements when you have to rewrite software without having to rewrite all the tests too. Why write tests for code you don&#x27;t keep?<p>Tests are part of the code. Why write code you don&#x27;t keep? Yes, you have to throw away tests if you throw away code but this is not a TDD issue. The issue is you&#x27;re throwing away the code (of which the tests are a part).<p>> Changing and adapting is harder when you are encumbered by tests. Tests should be written once you&#x27;ve agreed that what you have now is what you are going to keep.<p>No, changing and adapting is easier when you have tests because you can be sure that you haven&#x27;t broken anything. If tests fail when you change things, either the requirements have changed so you change the tests, or you&#x27;ve accidentally broken something and the tests have caught it. Tests should be written at the same time as the code to validate that the assumptions of the developer at the time the code is written remain true.<p>> Working software is the principal measure of progress<p>The <i>working</i> part is important - if comprehensive tests reduce defects in software - which is a pretty uncontroversial statement, if you disagree with this statement you are at odds with all the published research on the matter I have seen - then writing tests helps your progress by helping to deliver <i>working</i> software.<p>> TDD brings overhead: tests that needn&#x27;t ever have been written; tests that needn&#x27;t ever have been re-written. They hamper iteration and flexible response as they make it more costly to change plans.<p>And again, I repeat, this is an engineering tradeoff. Is speed more important that quality for your business case? Then TDD is a bad fit.",1380418837

Instead of trying to memorize facts I am using cards as a cue that it is time to revise and deepen my understanding of a particular topic.<p>Every time I learn about a new topic/concept/technique I will add a card to my anki deck with the topic name. E.g. Today I have added JS Promises.<p>Then when a topic comes up for review I spend 10-15 minutes reviewing my knowledge and trying to probe my mind for parts I do not understand and trying to link it to, and see how it can be used with, other related techniques.<p>After reviewing I then spend 30 minutes to 1 hour investigating the technique in more depth. At this point I&#x27;ll try and implement an aspect of it in code or see if I can answer a few problems people are having with the topic on stack overflow.<p>Then I will add a few notes to the card detailing what I have done so that I can make my next &quot;review&quot; of the card more challenging.<p>All up each review for a card takes close to 1.5 hours. I tend to have 1-2 cards come up per day to review.<p>I find it has given me a broad, and usable, understanding of software engineering practice and principles and has made me a better developer. The downside is I feel you will never become a master at these topics using this technique as the time investment per topic is just not enough.<p>I started using it because I found I had an experts understanding of some topics and a very weak understanding of other fundamental areas of computer science and software engineering. E.g. 1000+ hours of crafting complex regular expressions but lacking a proper understanding of the relational model and how a database table join works.<p>I would be really interested to see if there is any literature that examines using SRS in this manner (as opposed to learning simple facts).",1380418389

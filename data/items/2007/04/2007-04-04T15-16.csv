In the bank account example, rss simply isn't suitable and trying to make it suitable is a hack. How about using RSS to notify a customer of an event,  but have the actual content of the event stored somewhere else?<p>In other words, use RSS as a notification service, and have the link attribute point to somewhere that contains the proprietary format. So, anyone can be notified of the event, if you want to get more details, use an adapter that's suitable for reading that particular format.

Then I took what I've learned landscaping and started on ""3. Start a website or blog"" blogging about the landscape business. If there are any graphic designers looking for work designing flyers and logos let me know as google sends several people a day looking for landscaping flyer designs and templates.",1175701366

Also many people in the USA are skeptical about socialized health care.  The USA's system is definitely broken in some ways but it is not clear at all that the systems of other counties are not also broken in different ways.",1175701024
8810,comment,8610,8612,0,0,Leonidas,,,"I think it may depend on the type of startup.  If I was a ""dating"" related startup, I'd want to be in NYC.  NYC is very huge on the ""dating"" scene.  Heck, they have speed dating there where the guy has to make at least over half a million dollars a year and the girls have to be 'hot' to attend the speed dating session.  Tickets cost $500 per person and the speed dating sessions are always sold out.",1175700240

There were snide remarks made about Lisp in particular however, like claiming it is not ""used in industry"" and is thus ""nonstandard"".  Similar remarks could have been made against any language the guy DIDN'T know.  Regardless of the reasoning there are people like this who end up stamping Lisp (and other non-dominant solutions) out.",1175699879

8806,comment,8676,8703,0,0,Leonidas,,,"Actually, health insurance is an important factor.  If you catch pneumonia or the flu, you're looking at getting knocked out for 2 months (pneumonia resulting from a ""cold"" that was not properly handled), 2 weeks (flu) without medical intervention.  Personally, I'd rather take some meds and be back on my feet in 3-5 days than not be able to afford to see a doc or take some meds....putting my startup behind which would kill me more than an illness.  Without insurance you're looking at least $110 for per doctor visit and about $90 bucks and up depending on what meds you need (PER prescription). Or let's say you broke your arm or leg because you tripped on your shoe laces while walking down the stairs of the Y Combinator building.   Without insurance you're looking at about $2500 and up to get it fixed and that doesn't include the cost of seeing a doctor added into it.<p>Paying $120 bucks a month to cover potential injuries or finding affordable medical insurance and covering yourself for potential injuries is a definitely an important factor not only for yourself, your company, but also to prevent you from getting your co-founders sick.  <p>It is true that if you're younger you are less likely to get sick.  However, if you are under a substantial amount of stress, your immune defense will drop and your chances of getting sick increases.  That's why you see a lot of people get sick during mid terms and exams.<p>So for all of you who are in a startup, I suggest you get at least 1000-2000mg of Vitamin C. Clinical trials have shown that taking 1000-2000mg (usually an 8oz glass of OJ, depending on type of OJ) of Vitamin C a day provides prophylactic use (prevents the occurrence) against acute stress induced illnesses.<p><p><p><p>",1175699560

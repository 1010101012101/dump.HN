Most of the work was brochure sites. Although these bring in around 4-5x less than larger companies I found that it was easier to secure the deal and equally please the client. You can&#x27;t build the same brochure site for a corporate and charge 4-5x more, it just doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Now we are larger we deal with larger companies. The apps we build are larger and bring in greater deals. The chance of securing the deal though is a lot more than 4-5x harder. I also find the client harder to deal with. You end up dealing with people who are further removed from the people really making the decisions. You end up developing to the people you are talking to then you end up reworking projects when they actually show it to the people making the decisions.<p>All this process ends up costing us more but we are slowly refining processes for this. I suppose it&#x27;s a learning curve in dealing with larger companies but I find each client has their own set of challenges.<p>We now service both types of clients.

6916450,comment,6914805,6915892,19,0,mrow84,,,"In our society it is very difficult (though not entirely impossible) to survive without money. If you are not in a position to withhold your labour, because you have no money, then you have no bargaining power when determining your wages. In this case, a prospective employer can essentially offer you any wage they like - will that be a truly &quot;voluntary&quot; contract, even though you have no choice other than to accept it?<p>Simplistic solutions like &quot;just move elsewhere&quot; ignore both the inherent difficulties that moving poses when you are living in poverty, and the situations encountered by many people who take that option. As a new arrival you face the prospect of high initial costs trying to find a place to live and trying to find work, on top of the living costs you would have faced anyway, coupled to the fact that you are likely to have a reduced support network to help you deal with any problems you might face, and help you get on your feet. This is all after the initial expense of actually moving.<p>You asked your parent for a proposed solution, mine is simply for Amazon to more equitably distribute revenue within the company, to spend more on low-level wages, less on high-level wages, and less on other projects if there is a shortfall. In general I suspect that some kind of employee ownership goes quite far to alleviating many problems of this nature.<p>As a footnote, the only sense in which a market exchange is voluntary is that all parties agreed to it, which follows from the definition, and is therefore useless: &quot;market exchange&quot; will suffice. It is simply a disingenuous attempt to make the idea of a market exchange sound more humane, and to suggest an absence of coercion, without ever providing evidence that this is the case.",1387216486

The reaction to all of this over-the-top foreign spying stuff is as loud as it is precisely because most people were not aware of its extent, regardless of the stated mission of the NSA. The NSA grew so large and powerful because its projects were secret and thus largely shielded from public review. In that light, the secrecy is a lot more than an operational detail; it&#x27;s a deception directed at the American people in order to pursue unpopular security policy. Note, for example, that even the NSA&#x27;s <i>budget</i> is classified. They&#x27;ve built something very big, and they were only allowed to do it by keeping it in the dark.<p>To put that another way, if it really is merely the NSA&#x27;s stated mission and revealing its secrets is mere sabotage, why is it scandalous that they tapped Angela Merkel&#x27;s phone? Why is it outrageous that they&#x27;re spying on Google&#x27;s intra-datacenter communications? Why is tracking the world&#x27;s cell phone locations an embarrassing thing to have done? <i>Because if we&#x27;d been asked, we wouldn&#x27;t have let them do it.</i> But we weren&#x27;t asked, because secrets.<p>Thus, I think that revealing the extent of NSA spying, including all of the foreign stuff, falls in this bucket:<p>> Revealing that an entity is doing things it should not be doing so the correct oversight can be put in place.<p>In my view, our government doesn&#x27;t have a fundamental right to secrecy. We provisionally granted it the privilege of keeping some things secret from us (remember, <i>we&#x27;re</i> The People) because we felt it was in a good position to make the tradeoffs required there.

It is mainly, but not exclusively about the wages.<p>> for a decent wage<p>Amazon is not paying according to the Branchentarifvertrag (industry sector collective agreement) and refuses to even sit down with the union and talk about collective bargaining. They are also actively trying to keep their employees from unionizing.\nIf you consider the current wages &quot;decent&quot; is up to your point of view, but the union and I&#x27;d guess most of the affected workers disagree.<p>> The fact that most of the workers are not on strike proves that they&#x27;re satisfied with their jobs<p>This proves nothing, in particular not job satisfaction, and is actually also not how things work in Germany and therefore just wrong.\nFirst a union will usually selectively shut down just a few facilities instead of all at once. This is called &quot;Warnstreiks&quot; (warning strikes), and this is what is happening right now. Only later and and only in accordance with German strike/bargaining law - e.g. you have to be unionized and are prohibited to violate the &quot;Friedenspflicht&quot;, which regulates when and under what circumstances a unionized strike may happen - it is possible to enter the actual &quot;Streik&quot; where all (unionized) employees stop working.\nPlus, amazon employees where often not unionized before this started, so it might take some time and convincing for the union to get employees to join before they enter the &quot;Warnstreiks&quot;.<p>> Plus, nobody forced them to accept those jobs<p>Well, the &quot;Arbeitsagentur&quot; (job center) can cut either your unemployment pay or later social welfare (Hartz 4) if you refuse to accept the jobs that are offered to you. If you also happen to have a family, and IIRC amazon employs quite a few single mothers for example, then you&#x27;re &quot;forced&quot; to take the job in a way.<p>Some people, in particular union folks of course, even accuse amazon of predatory behavior, especially seeking out the weakest members of society for their work force because they are the least likely to fight against inhumane conditions and low wages. I used to think this predatory characterization was sensationalist and unfair, but by now, from what I read about amazon so far in the press and even in their own press statements, I think there might be something to it. But then again, I&#x27;m also just one of these Euro-socialists who thinks that everybody should have health insurance and should earn a living wage if working full time.\nAmazon more or less takes the same stance as you seem to take: They claim that they are just helping the weakest people. Treating your low-paid work force as if they were industrial robots (one of the complaints by workers and the union, and more or less admitted by amazon to happen as a result of their workplace rules and &quot;processes&quot;) and keeping them from effectively complaining about it by keeping them from organizing suggests otherwise.",1387216208

While I&#x27;m constantly amazed at how much we&#x27;re able to charge for our product, I&#x27;m equally amazed at the reasons deals go sideways.<p>In the consumer space, you&#x27;re working with averages over large quantities. The number of potential buyers is huge, so you need to build a product that, on-average, will result in more sales than non-sales when the customer reaches the point of making a decision. This decision point might happen tens of thousands of times -- sometimes millions -- a year for consumer products.<p>In the enterprise world, the number of sales opportunities are smaller by orders of magnitude. Every sale becomes a huge gamble, and as a result you tend to throw an immense amount of resources at every sale. This is also one of the primary reasons enterprise software ends up so bloated and unmanageable. On the front-end, the decision making process for purchasing enterprise software is driven by checklists and &quot;due diligence&quot; procedures that are horrible at accounting for software quality. You&#x27;re more likely to win an enterprise contract by saying &quot;sure, we&#x27;ll add that feature&quot; than you are carefully explaining how maintaining product focus results in a more usable product.<p>This makes enterprise software a high-stakes game. A sale results in windfall revenue, but a non-sale can severely strain cash-flows. At the end of the day, you&#x27;re still trying to beat the averages, but you&#x27;re working with a much smaller number of opportunities, so wins and losses move the needle in a big way. I think this is a significant incentive for small shops and independent devs to avoid the enterprise space. You need a larger bank roll to attack the enterprise market. We bootstrapped our company, and we hit several gut checks along the way. The days of writing large checks to my company are not quickly forgotten.",1387216078

Eventually I found that you could read the graphics memory, so I stopped saving any of the game state at all: I&#x27;d tell if there was an obstacle by just reading the graphics memory and seeing if the according pixel was already black. Now system dialogs like the calculator&#x27;s &quot;reminders&quot; could draw their dialogues to the screen and become obstacles themselves. Now I couldn&#x27;t tell food from obstacles, so I just got rid of the food idea and now you grow infinitely, and the randomly dropping obstacles XOR their targets to potentially free up walls to pass through.<p>Like it sounds, the game went through a lot of changes like this in structure through the course of development, where the nature of the game had entirely changed. I had a number of friends with my model of calculator, which was not the more-common TI-86 at my school, so I was the only, err, game in town. Because it was in-effect several games over its lifetime, and different people wanted different versions of it, I learnt a lot about maintainability and version management. &quot;You have the six-month-old version of this with food, and it has a bug that I fixed five months ago in a different game.

You only have so much airpower at your disposal, you&#x27;re limited by flight deck space and pilot availability, you want to keep some in reserve, and aircraft are a <i>bitch</i> to maintain. Like, a week in service per day of flight time.<p>Basically, you default to not using them. You don&#x27;t bust them out unless you have good reason to. You don&#x27;t just cruise around looking for people who look suspicious, because that would be a tremendous waste of resources that could be better-spent elsewhere. Like transporting supplies for the troops on the ground. You only bust out the planes when you have solid, definitive, verified evidence that there is something that should get blown up.<p>Drones flip that around. You can&#x27;t quite go cruisin&#x27; around just looking for stuff, but it&#x27;s worth the time & effort to check out quite a few of your semi-sketchy tips. Now you&#x27;re doing a lot more operations, on less-reliable intel, and the risk of cock-ups rises significantly. But because the drones are remote, none of that risk is borne by any member of the military performing the operations; all the extra risk falls on the local civilian population. I don&#x27;t think many people partaking in these operations are intentionally heartless, but this is a classic case of moral hazard, and on the margin more aggressive, risk-taking behavior is incentivized.<p>Additionally, putting a drone in the sky is faster than putting a regular plane in the sky. This means that planes tend to be used only against &#x27;static&#x27; targets, which gives you an opportunity to scout & verify. Drones allow you to hit &#x27;time-sensitive&#x27; targets, which means you are now making time-sensitive decisions. A wedding party got hit because some dude had literally minutes (or less) to decide if a collection of vehicles was a wedding or an armed convoy.

The main problems arise when our justice system favors one thing over another - be it groups over individuals, whites over blacks or rich over poor.  Dispersing power, focusing on equality before the law and in opportunity, and reducing coercive forces on individuals is the solution.

Honestly one of the better executions I&#x27;ve seen in quite a few senses.<p>There are quite a few things I&#x27;d say make this difficult to a first time user.<p>1. The tools being on two separate sides of the site seems strange to me; the left side seems to be drawing (or otherwise &quot;putting&quot;) tools, the right side seems to be &quot;editing&quot; tools. Except that the pen is on the right. And so is the text box.<p>2. There is no &quot;active&quot; state for the selected tool, so I may very easily get confused about what is going to be done when i click.<p>3. The modality of any of the tools could be changed in some ways; for instance, having a delete &quot;tool&quot; rather than a delete &quot;button&quot; is more like erase, as pranavpiyush mentioned.<p>4. Using prompt for entering your name isn&#x27;t great; using prompt to enter text onto the canvas is really very frustrating.<p>5. The trash icon is confusing. I&#x27;d rather have a &quot;clear this board&quot; icon, or go full-fledged whiteboard with it and show me a whiteboard eraser. I don&#x27;t throw my whiteboard markings in a trash can - I erase them. If you&#x27;re going to take advantage of skeuomorphs, make sure they are the right ones.<p>6. If sharing the URL is a core functionality, make that url easily copyable inside your interface. Most of the time, I am not going to share this on Twitter or Facebook. Most of the time, I&#x27;m going to send that url to a coworker or friend.<p>7. I have no clue where to &quot;save&quot;. With something like this, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve yet reached the implicit &quot;auto-save&quot; feeling. I need to feel secure about my board and accessing it at another time.<p>8. Uploading an image is a great idea, but don&#x27;t make me drag unless you&#x27;re going to keep my dragged area visible; when I drag, the marker goes away and the modal replaces it - that makes me feel like I made a mistake.<p>9. When I drag a shape over another shape, a new bound shows that implies that the two shapes may be merged, but that doesn&#x27;t happen when I drop the shape.<p>10. Many move tools also &quot;select&quot; an element for further manipulations (like moving with a mouse) - a simple version of this might be a good addition, along with basic scaling operations.<p>11. I like colors - I like picking my own, too. Any regular old color picker will do, or at least a hex input, so I can use my brand colors (or whatever).<p>12. Not sure if it exists, but I don&#x27;t see a way to add a new board. This is a space where this could be hugely beneficial - multiple boards, with titles. Then this easily becomes a teaching tool that maintains its own history; export to PDF? Sure. Export to PPT? Sure. Autoupload to slideshare?

The original ARM had 16 x 32 bit registers, and a single assembler command could write some or all of them to memory in one go. In practice you could use about 12 of the registers for graphics data (the others being program counters and stack pointers etc). Each pixel was 2 bytes, so with 12 registers you could do 1 row of 24 pixels - all in one instruction. Fetch some new data into the registers and write them again 24 times and you had a 24x24 sprite drawn very fast. To really use this technique you had to draw at word boundaries, thus the movement had to be 4 pixels per frame. But you could do a good full-screen scroll with this at around 12-15 fps (Archimedes could also do double-buffered screen memory so you draw one while displaying the other) and still plenty of time to do all the other work for each frame.",1387214746

The employer then has to weigh the cost of increased wages vs. the economic harm that would be done if the business were to shut down while they found and trained new workers.<p>For unspecialized positions, a worker&#x27;s leverage is proportional to that economic harm, not that worker&#x27;s skill,  or length of service, or particular suitability to the job vs. someone else.  The economic harm is proportional to the economic value which was created by others, often including the public at large (e.g., power plants and transportation systems exist by laws and permits that essentially divide up natural resources owned by everyone).  A moral opposition to leveraging the efforts and resources of others to enrich your own bargaining position (&#x27;hostage-taking&#x27; in anti-union parlance) is the counterargument to &#x27;perhaps they should get paid more if the BART is so important&#x27;.<p>Obviously there&#x27;s some middle ground here between abusive behavior on either side of a labor dispute.

The prevailing average wage rate for university Presidents is simply a reflection of the price point at which the supply and demand curves of capable labor for this position meet.  Conversely, if there was an abundance of people who could fulfill this position, wages would decrease commensurately.  There is nothing wrong with someone making $1 million, or $10 million, or $100 million for performing a function, provided that wage is being offered to everyone who can perform that function indiscriminately.  Of course, a system made up of imperfect agents will not function in a theoretically perfect fashion, but this is more or less how things work.  I&#x27;m sure that being the President of a university is not without its myriad challenges, and it is unlikely that the average Joe off of the street could perform this function well.  Thus, wages for university Presidents are going to be higher than the average Joe&#x27;s wages.  The solution for the average Joe is not to attempt to bring down the wages of the university President, but to aspire to become capable of performing the function of the university President himself.<p>Simplistic?

We know that there is water in the form of ice in lots of places on Mars but the idea of subsurface liquid water is exciting because there might be life in there! If it&#x27;s gushing up to the surface periodically, we might even be able to sample it and see if there&#x27;s signs of life! There&#x27;s been previous evidence of these streaks before - but researchers had generally thought that was due to ice melting during the planet&#x27;s warm season. Now they&#x27;ve found &quot;streaks near the equator, including in the gargantuan Valles Marineris canyon&quot;. Any subsurface ice here would likely have sublimated. So it&#x27;s looking pretty likely that this is subsurface liquid water that is leaking out from time to time.\nAn alternative explanation - dust avalanches - was offered when the same scientists unveiled their initial results back in 2011. With the observation of so many streaks at the equator now the simplest explanation appears to be groundwater welling up to the surface.

What has never been shown is that consuming SFA raises serum SFA; instead, it&#x27;s been an understood truism held in place by policy and demagoguery. This study is small, but evidence convicting saturated fats was extremely weak to begin with, and we are now seeing positive evidence exonerating it.<p>If you are interested in learning more about the history of nutrition, I highly recommend Nina Teicholz book The Big Fat Surprise. As others have mentioned, Phinney and Volek&#x27;s books are a great overview off the science as of a few years ago. Phinney has been doing research on this for 40 years, quite an accomplishment, given how hard it has been to get funding for research that contradicts the policy line of &quot;carbs are critical to survival and fat must be avoided&quot;.",1416689992

After all, I gave up a career of a hedge fund manager and a billionaire already to be an engineer - probably for the same reasons, because I suspect I&#x27;d actually suck at hedge fund managing and won&#x27;t become a billionaire. In the same vein, if I tried to become a director knowing I&#x27;d suck at it, I may briefly enjoy the benefits of higher salary, after which my incompetence and my dissatisfaction with the job would become apparent and I&#x27;d be asked to leave. So long term it is probably a bad plan, unless people I&#x27;m going to direct over and report to are exceptionally obtuse and won&#x27;t notice me reaching my Peter ceiling. That happens, but why would I want my life to depend on it?<p>And remember, we&#x27;re not talking about vow of poverty here exactly. 150K gets you in top 10% easily, and if you have a household with two 150K salaries you&#x27;re pretty close to the much envied 1%.

My life is not a competition with them, it&#x27;s a competition with my last year self. If I win that, I&#x27;m good. Which means, if the company wants to keep a good engineer who thinks like me, they should be able to provide some track for me to be better next year - position-wise, money-wise, respect-wise, responsibility-wise, however it goes - than last year, without forcing people into doing something they may suck at.",1416688921

Perhaps measuring the success by a more personal and human method describes the elephant better: Deferred income. Take an average (yes, also fraught with trouble) of yearly income for people of that skill set (entrepuners, coders, widget makers, inventors, etc ) and then see if the founders and employees made less, within a standard deviation, or far above that average, on a year to year basis.

It is the _relative_ lack of default &quot;configuration&quot; (that is decided by someone else) that makes me stay with FreeBSD and NetBSD.  Of course, lack of default configuration is the antithesis of popular Linux distributions.  Whenever I have to use one, I spend more time learning how to turn things off than I ever did learning how to turn things on.<p>The answer to the original question is, I think, &quot;no&quot;, switching is probably not the path of least resistance for many Linux users. Because when the Linux user makes that switch, they immediately find that someone has not done everything for them.<p>And from what I have seen, observing the questions of Linux users who first try FreeBSD or NetBSD, they generally do not like that. It means they have to do some configuration of their own.  And even if they are comfortable doing configuration, it means they have to learn things that are different from the &quot;Linux way&quot;; and they inevitably encounter shortcomings that are due to lack of developer resources (read: time).<p>In doing things for yourself you learn about how things work.  The rc.d system that all BSD projects use is coherent and relatively easy to understand.  For whatever that is worth.<p>This debate over systemd seems to cut to the core of the value of learning about how things work.  The reader can draw their own conclusions.<p>Linux is only a kernel and it should still be possible and thus optional to run that kernel with a basic init (or init alternative, e.g., one based on daemontools) and with userland utilties that do not need systemd.<p>The question I have is how difficult the popular Linux distribution folks are going to make that for their users to do.<p>And if they do make it difficult, it raises the question, &quot;Why?&quot;",1416687674

Systemd is an application that more properly belongs on Microsoft Windows and MacOS, because of their own tendency towards centralization and control.

8646506,comment,8645188,8645352,0,0,cwp,,,"NixOS got this right.<p>Declarative configuration is great in theory but it doesn&#x27;t scale well. See Amazon&#x27;s CloudFront configuration files for what configuration in JSON looks like. (For example, <a href=""https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-west-2/CloudWatch_Logs.template"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-...</a>) It quickly gets hard to manage the syntax and balance all the quotes, parentheses, braces and brackets, with careful use of whitespace being critical for even a hope of understanding it. When you add in semantics, it gets even worse. Take the &quot;Ref&quot; construct in CloudFront to work around the fact that JSON doesn&#x27;t have a way to name something and refer to it elsewhere.<p>As the amount of configuration grows, you have to introduce abstractions to encapsulate common patterns, break out of deep nesting, name things etc. I guess it&#x27;s possible to do that declaratively, but that leads to things like XSLT. (Or, open the CloudFormation JSON linked above and search for &quot;Fn::&quot;. It makes me shudder).<p>S-expressions would indeed be better than JSON, but they still wouldn&#x27;t scale without macros. So either all programs would have to know lisp, or you need a dedicated program for executing the configuration.<p>That&#x27;s what NixOS has. It does all configuration via &quot;nix expresssions&quot; which are written in a lazy, functional language. The functional bit allows for the abstraction necessary to make large amounts of configuration readable and maintainable. The lazy bit makes executing large configurations efficient, given that you&#x27;re usually only interested in certain parts of it at any one time.<p>The result is that you can write a configuration that describes a cluster of machines from top to bottom: from how many app servers to put behind the load-balancer to which version of zlib to link node.js against.<p>It takes a bit of effort to learn nix, and for many, the functional paradigm will be strange and scary.

    idea with its &quot;previous IE&quot; mode: if the renderer emits

    UA.)
</code></pre>
IE dropping into various modes to interpret your document can be wonderful when it works, but can also be a huge pain.  I work on PageSpeed, an open source optimizing proxy, and this IE behavior keeps us from making a lot of optimizations on IE.  Consider this code:<p><pre><code>    <link rel=stylesheet href=&quot;main.css&quot;>
    <!--[if IE 7]>
       <link rel=stylesheet href=&quot;ie.css&quot;>
    <![endif]-->
    <link rel=stylesheet href=&quot;more.css&quot;>
</code></pre>
Combining multiple CSS files into one is a great way to speed up page load times because most of the time in loading these resources is waiting for the round trip.  We would like to issue:<p><pre><code>    IE7:
      <link rel=stylesheet href=&quot;main+ie+more.css&quot;>

    Other browsers:
      <link rel=stylesheet href=&quot;main+more.css&quot;>
</code></pre>
But IE&#x27;s impersonation keeps us from doing this.  When we process a page requested with an IE UA, we don&#x27;t know which version of IE it will decide to be when interpreting the page.  Yes, it claims to be IE10, but if it sees something to drop it into IE7 mode then we shouldn&#x27;t have removed ie.css.<p>My favorite part of this announcement is the link [1] to where MS says this detection is going away:<p><pre><code>    The next major version of IE will still honor document
    modes served by intranet sites, sites on the Compatibility
    View list, and when used with Enterprise Mode only. ...
    Public Internet sites will be rendered with the new Edge
    mode platform.

8646497,comment,8645443,8645443,0,0,wyc,,,"This is a brief (probably incomplete) summary of my understanding (many points
also supported by the essays in your included link):<p>---<p>Philosophy:<p>FreeBSD has the concept of a base system: a set of tools intended to work
together harmoniously, maintained by a core group of people. You can easily
find evidence of this by looking at the source code; the userspace tools sit
right next to the kernel[0]. This is in contrast to _GNU_/Linux, where everything
(including coreutils) is pulled in from various sources. Many Linux
distributions emulate a base system by including utilities that transform the
kernel into a complete standard system (e.g. Debian[1]).<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/tree/master/usr.bin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/tree/master/usr.bin</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html#s3.7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html#s3.7</a><p>---<p>Leadership:<p>Linux has a benevolent dictator who decides project direction[0], while FreeBSD
has a core group of contributers who decide the future of the project. However,
I&#x27;m not sure that the Cathedral vs. Bazaar is a fair comparison to impose on
these projects[1]. In any case, both projects seem to have been getting things
done, and unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), I&#x27;m not too savvy on internal
managerial disputes or issues.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Torvalds/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Torvalds/index.shtml</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.freebsd.org/advocacy/myths.html#closed-model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.freebsd.org/advocacy/myths.html#closed-model</a><p>---<p>Package Management:<p>The closest Linux distribution to FreeBSD is most likely Gentoo Linux, as its
Portage system is very heavily inspired by the FreeBSD Ports system, in which
all &quot;packages&quot; are simply recipes to build from source. You can even run the
Gentoo project on a BSD kernel[0], although this sickens most FreeBSD users
for some reason. Most other Linux distributions default to installing binary
packages, which is also possible, but not traditional in FreeBSD[1].<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo/Alt#Gentoo.2FFreeBSD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo/Alt#Gentoo.2FFreeBSD</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/pkgng-intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/pkgng-intro.html</a><p>---<p>Process Management:<p>Linux has recently added LXC, while FreeBSD has had Jails for a while now[0].
LXC is much better marketed than BSD Jails through Docker, but
Absolute FreeBSD has an excellent section that describes how to do isolated
deployments via Jails[1]. FreeBSD also has the Linuxulator[2] that emulates
32-bit Linux system calls via FreeBSD system calls, allowing users to
seamlessly run Linux binaries on FreeBSD. The FreeBSD startup system, however,
has stayed more or less the same for the past few decades, revolving around
an rc.conf file and init scripts. Linux has seen many more efforts in this
area, including systemd and initramfs.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Absolute-FreeBSD-Complete-Guide-Edition/dp/1593271514"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Absolute-FreeBSD-Complete-Guide-Editio...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/linuxemu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/linuxemu.html</a><p>---<p>Licensing:<p>BSD projects use a BSD license, which many businesses prefer over the GNU
license used by Linux. However, this is a discussion that deserves more than
a small summary.<p>---<p>Misc:<p>Linux is most likely to support recent hardware because of extensive userbase
and industry support. For example, NVidia&#x27;s latest CUDA SDKs always have Linux 
bindings, but not BSD ones.<p>The BSDs have great reputations for killer implementations of TCP/IP.<p>The BSDs have been using the GEOM[0] disk management system for a long time,
which is one of my personal favorites in terms of features. It allows you to
treat character and block devices as pipes, so for example, adding encryption
is simply &quot;piping&quot; a bare disk through an encryption layer, resulting in a new
device. You can even &quot;pipe&quot; things across the network. Linux is somewhat caught
up via device-mapper, so this is not a huge deal if you&#x27;re trying to choose
which one to use. Both are great operating systems. Just use whatever works.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/geom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/geom.html</a><p>It&#x27;s likely that you know things that I don&#x27;t, so please feel free to correct

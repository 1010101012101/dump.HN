1841929,comment,1840444,1840875,0,0,silvertab,,,"> I've looked into frameworks like Django. It's not good because it abstracts away the functionality of the database. It's nice that everything is an object, but if you want to do something more complex and go around the framework, things get messy and start to feel hackish.<p>I was thinking the same when I first worked with frameworks (Rails at first, Django now...). First there was the honeymoon phase, where it seems like the framework does everything you need... then you start to encounter the first problems (i.e. try to do something thats a bit more complex...), and you start thinking; Well, the framework does everything for you 90% of the time, but the 10% when it doesn't makes up for the time you saved...<p>But I found that after working with a framework for a while (almost 2 years with Django in my case) you get to know its strength and its weakness, and you get to do more complex stuff a lot more easily (for example, I often resort to raw SQL with Django, it's just a matter of doing Model.objects.raw() ). In the end, I think it's worth working with a framework because well, obviously it prevents you from having to re-write boring boilerplate/glue code, but it also (usually, or perhaps I should say, hopefully) means you are working with a well-tested codebase on which to build up on. In my case, I would say the time it took me to really learn how to work with Django was worth it today, if only for the time it makes me save now!...",1288245509

If a new string is typed; a new column is started; and so on.<p>In your example, if I understand correctly; it is assumed that there is a list of 3 ""Hello World""s.

I certainly have done 16 hour stretches of coding, but I don't think anyone can sustain that for more than a day or two and still be sane. (I think you turn into rms, which can be seen as good or bad).<p>The message that I would like to give you is that of quality over quantity.<p>First off, you don't have to be at a computer to be solving your coding problems, keep a notebook, keep them in your head, write down answers as they come. Relaxing you think about a problem probably doesn't count against your concentration hours.<p>Secondly, if you are banging your head against a problem, it is probably time to take a break or get help with it... There are diminishing returns from struggling with a problem.<p>I don't doubt that you can spend more than 40 hours a week coding, but that seems like a shitty quality of life.\nWouldn't you rather see the sun occasionally?<p>Wouldn't it be better for you to just work within the 40 hours, optimizing your use of them? Maybe find  a way to get stuff done at work more efficiently, so you can spend more of your quota coding your side project?<p>It might also help to not try so hard when you are 'concentrating'. Let me explain:<p>I feel like if you are trying really hard, it takes more out of you mentally than if you are approaching it from a mentality of playing. Having more fun will definitely stretch your endurance for these things.<p>My mantra is to 'work' as little as possible to achieve my goals. So I like to turn 'work' things into puzzles/games. 'Work' is psychologically un-fun.",1288244533

It is definitely not a case of want to but I have too, I pulled a 116hr week one week of literally non-stop code. I freelance and not pulling those hours means that I loose the contracts that I have. It is a treadmill but one thing I have learned and the piece of advice I can give you is that once it becomes habit, it is actually easy to put in these kind of hours regularly if it is what you want to do. I now find that while I work long hours when I do work, I also tend to schedule longer amounts of time off to travel and recharge, it works for me, but I would like to have enough head room to get back to doing my own stuff as well.",1288243703

And in all honesty, weight shouldn't be a deciding factor anyway - you can't operate the damn keyboard in mid-air, so you're going to be setting down your laptop a lot. If you're running a dedicated environment, you're also probably walking around with a backpack or messenger bag - my preference here, both for easier access and just plain looking cooler : )<p>But the issues of screen size and better keyboards are huge. Between the common need of many for running VNC and remote servers, and just the fact that an increase in pixels up to somewhere around 3000x1000 leads <i>directly</i> to increased productivity, the drawbacks of a 4-5 hour battery and an extra pound or two quickly fade away. Most people that are serious about the portability either bring a charger or an extended battery - I prefer the latter, since I often find myself in places without outlets or power strips (like the subway, or a conference auditorium ).<p>Think about it this way : What's the difference between a bag that contains the following:<p>3-lb ""Workhorse"" laptop;\npower cable;\nspare laptop battery;\nnotebook;\npens;<p>And one that has a 1-lb netbook?<p>Nothing.<p>Except for the fact that the netbook is slower and smaller, and only marginally cheaper.<p>As I write this, I begin to regret my own purchase :P",1288243292

Which would be a good thing.<p>* Yeah, you're not the first to comment about that.  I've experimented with some others, but haven't found one that I like yet.  I'll keep experimenting.  Any ideas in that regard would be welcome -- I'm a programmer not a graphic designer.<p>* Hmm... I see your point.  But I picked the size very intentionally.  I wanted them to be larger so I had room to include all the information I needed while still allowing users to get a good solid look at the picture.  I can certainly include more per page, and I can experiment with allowing more visible on the screen.  But I don't want to shrink the image size.  300px x 300px is exactly where I wanted it.  Of course, I'm always open to being convinced if it's an issue for lots of people.  And I'll certainly keep it in mind an experiment with it.<p>* Yeah, I've done lots of experimenting with colors.  But so far, the white on grey (Black at .8 opacity actually) works best.  I'll keep experimenting.  Again, I'm a programmer, not a designer :/<p>* Thanks!  That's actually a recent update in response to feedback, so I can't really take credit for that one.  But I'll pass it on ;)<p>* Yeah, not sure what's up with that.  Might have something to do with improper escaping somewhere.  I'll go hunting for it.<p>* Sections have already been implemented in the add and edit form.  Just haven't gotten around to editing the recipes that were added before sections were implemented to use them.<p>* Yeah, that's not the only one.  I haven't given the admin privileges to edit user profiles yet.  I need to do that so I can fix it.  The escaping is an artifact of a bug that's been fixed.  I'll make a note to fix that profile, thanks!<p>* The ones that don't use it have preparation in the ""amount"" column - most of them.  Because the preparation column wasn't available when they were added.  Again, some editing will fix that.<p>* Completely agree on this one.  Will work on it.<p>* Hmm... advanced search is in the works.  Will include that.  But a lot of recipes are lacking prep-time, so I don't know that it will be that effective.  Maybe I can make prep time wiki-editable so that if the initial poster doesn't include, future users can.<p>Thanks for the comments and feedback!  I really appreciate it.

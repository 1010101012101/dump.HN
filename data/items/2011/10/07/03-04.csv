This is obvious when you list out your star options: 1,2,3,4,5.  3/5 stars visually appears to be better than 50%, but is actually exactly 50% due to the inability to choose 0 stars.<p>(This seems unresolvable as most people now recognize the image of 5 unfilled stars as null rather than 0%.)",1317959911

The devices like the Sensation and SGS II have screen resolutions of 800x480; 480x320 just wasn't going to look good next to them. Apple's stuck at 3.5"" like you mentioned, so to compete with the new high-resolution (and larger screen, as a result) devices, they doubled the iPhone 4's resolution, which is a pretty decent compromise. One of the benefits of increasing resolution without increasing the display size is that your DPI skyrockets, and they jumped on that and marketed the <i>crap</i> out of it. The display looks ""better"", even if it's not larger. I would be genuinely surprised if Apple released an iPhone variant at >3.5"". They <i>might</i> release an iPod Touch around ~3.75"", but that's as high as they can really go before the 3:2 aspect ratio starts to make the device width prohibitive.",1317959773

Publicly praising/endorsing a famous living person on one hand gives him more power, and on the other hand encourages antagonism from the detractors/enemies/competitors of that person because praising/endorsing someone is an act of aligning with that person.<p>Giving power to others is not something human beings naturally want to do. Neither is inviting opposition. When the subject of the praise or endorsement is dead, the whole equation changes. Dead people have no power over you, and whatever enemies or competitors they used to have are usually no longer opposed to them.<p>Just my two cents.

3082565,comment,3082241,3082519,2,0,teamlaft,,,"Glen it basically comes down to a genre by genre breakdown I think.  If you're looking for a comedy which should inherently have high rewatchability, if any are rated as low then I can assume I should avoid them.  For example, in college my buddies and I alternated watching 40 Year Old Virgin and Grandma's Boy for an entire semester.  Neither would have the best quality ratings, but they were fun and sure had high rewatchability.<p>Now take the other end of the spectrum of film like Black Swan or even some slower paced films.  I love 2001 A Space Odyssey but am not rushing to rewatch soon (though it has top quality) because it is way too slooow for me.  Or take some dramas that while interesting on first glance don't really merit another watch.<p>Basically I think you should start with a top down approach by genre, and if something like comedy then the dominant factor is rewatchability but then for others it may be ""quality"" (which itself could be subdivided further into cinematographic elements for an auteur film, the musical score for a certain type, etc).

The whole point of the iPhone is that it's touch friendly. Part of the iOS user interface guidelines is making sure touch areas are the size of a finger tip. This is heavily emphasized.<p>If there were different sized iPhone screens with incompatible aspect ratios this guideline would be meaningless. An app that has finger sized touch zones on a 4.3 inch widescreen phone would not on a 3.5 inch standard screen phone.<p>Apple's designers know this. It's on purpose. And Apple's designers decide what its devices look like. That's why the iPhone 4 has a 3.5 inch screen.<p>If you want to wonder why the original iPhone had a 3.5 screen, you've got to go back to 2007 when everyone else was still trying to copy the Blackberry. A 3.5 inch screen at that time was already unprecedented.<p>I don't doubt Apple prototypes iPhones with different screen sizes and there is pressure to upgrade. But the fact Apple has not just shows how reluctant it is to break with consistency. If Apple moves to a new screen size, I think it will have to be larger for backward compatibility with old apps. I highly doubt it will go smaller, ever. All old apps would suck on a smaller screen, and Apple doesn't deliver sucky user experiences. And if it does go larger, it will be a big deal.

If you're the kind of person who likes watching beautifully constructed but largely enjoyable films, your tastes will tend toward the top-right of the graph.

MapReduce is a distributed computation engine. While it can be used in that way it was never meant to be a database system. BigTable is proof enough of that.<p>In general, SQL is the syntactical representation of relational algebra with some hacky additions for programmer convenience. Comparing just ""SQL"" to the MongoDB language model is misguided since you then break down to a question of algebraic expressivity and relational power.<p>I'm not going to try and build a proof here but we do know that a formal relational algebra system is equivalent to first-order logic. As far as MongoDB's relational language goes, one would probably have to make an argument that it is equivalent to either tuple or domain relational calculus, but I know of no theoretical work that has attempted this.

Cookies you create in one Incognito tab or window are visible to all other Incognito tabs/windows, just as cookies created in plain tabs/windows are visible to all other plain tabs/windows. So if you go into Incognito mode and browse there for a few hours, soon you've got a bunch of cookies that are following you around the Internet until you close all your Incognito tabs. In my case, I have Chrome set up to delete all cookies on exit, so Incognito doesn't buy me much: I might as well just quit the browser and restart.<p>If Incognito mode worked in such a way that each <i>tab</i> were its own cookie sandbox, then I'd be reasonably satisfied with it as a cookie management solution, but as it stands, it's not good enough. (Because each tab is a separate process in Chrome, one would think that it would be reasonably easy to support that behavior.) In lieu of that, what I'd really like is a Chrome extension like Firefox's CookieSafe, where I can block all cookies by default and then whitelist them back in on a site-by-site basis, but nothing like that exists at the moment.<p>For now, the best I can do is the Tab Cookies extension, which removes a domain's cookies once you close the last tab that's browsing the domain.

Google Analytics tells me that in September I had 137,515 page views and 87,471 unique visitors.  That's actually quite a typical month for my site.<p>I do two things currently to monetize the site (actually just my blog): AdSense and an affiliate link for my book.  In September this resulted in:<p>1. Â£24.73 ($38.88) in AdSense revenue<p>2. 724 clicks on the affiliate link resulting in Â£27.39 ($43.08) in revenue from Amazon.com<p>So I made a total of Â£52.13 ($81.96) from my site in September.<p>Could I do better?  If so, how?",1285923849

One beer and I want to curl up under my desk and go to sleep. As a possible counter-point I knew an ex-M$ employee that could drink 6 beers during lunch then go back to work and be productive. :) I have much to learn before I shall become a jedi-knight.",1285923711

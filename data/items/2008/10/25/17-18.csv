Other than that, I can install what I want. We did not experience anything horrible regarding security - it is just we need a few full-time employees to take care of that.<p>Regarding Vista, the reasons mentioned above applied to us as well...we didnt migrate and it seems that everyone is waiting on Win7 already.",1224957530

343677,comment,343633,343633,0,0,kqr2,,,"I think he's endorsing ""data driven development"", i.e. if you focus on capturing the right data, you can simplify your application logic immensely.  In his magazine example, by encoding the magazine regulation rules as table columns, the owner would have been able to modify the behavior himself.  Instead the rules are encapsulated in complex program logic that neither the author or owner are willing to modify for fear of breaking.<p>I think DSLs (or domain specific language) would probably be too difficult for the magazine owner.  If it was database driven, he could use a gui tool such as phpmyadmin to edit the magazine regulation rules.",1224957164

Nice.<p>> .. below commenter (I guess its the same person)<p>and conspiracy theories to boot. I don't know who the ""below commenter"" you are referring to is, but as I mentioned, there is a created field in the profile so you can see if my profile was created yesterday just to bother you. You ignored that. But then I guess that would of course be dealing with facts.<p>The point of my original post was to give you something to think about on two fronts : ""full of either brahmins or SC/ST"" and regarding the south that ""casteism has always been a problem here"".  The population talk was regarding the  second point (as I also mentioned in the original post). But again, you seem to have missed that.<p>> There is no point debating with you.

343674,comment,343549,343653,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"Yeah, when was the last time you wrote code on a whiteboard when you WEREN'T in an interview? Definitely good advice, but I would caution that it's just an interview skill, and only serves to improve your performance rather than your content.<p>Also, you should remember from your test-taking skills that time asleep is more valuable than time studying. Thus, as pointed out, you should really make sure you're well-rested.",1224956842

These URLs are relative to the container URL. You’ll get a response like [’./1′, ‘./2′, ‘./3′] (actually [’1′, ‘2′, ‘3′] would be fine too). Do GET {article-url} to get the article representation.""<p>The original post that started this interesting conversation did mention that summary data could be included along with the individual item URLs. If that summary data is complete to a point where action can be taken without further queries, then I'm totally on-board.<p>If not, then imagine the impact on your service if every data aggregation api query performed by your database resulted in dozens of follow-on queries as people traverse result lists and ask to get each item individually.",1224956599

343665,comment,343594,343645,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"It's not ""hard"", it's just ""different"". I don't see how it breaks a ""certain type of thinking"" that we are ""wired"" for, other than that it fundamentally different from the imperative / structured programming that 99% of programmers are introduced to in their first language. I don't see how breaking with that model is beyond the ken of human beings. You can even take intermediate steps; learning Python and its code introspection features makes ""code == data"" a lot simpler to grok because you've already seen that sort of thing before.<p>Maybe the electrician just wired your brain wrong.

Lisp breaks this model, and so it's difficult for people to pick it up.<p>If you have ever parsed a syntactic tree, you'll realize that it's inherently an s-expression. That means that everything you ever say, and all human communication for that matter, are s-expressions.<p>Sans the logic, operators, symbol quoting and observance of rules (first item is interpreted as a function), lisp is at its core as close to human language you'll ever get. Popularity depends on other things, but lisp doesn't break the way we think.",1224955581

I really don't see how Lisp is inherently less (or for that matter, more) graspable on a fundamental level. Are you a neurologist? And do you have any actual experience with Lisp?",1224955442

No matter how confident you are, it's amazing how nerves can cause you to stand there at the whiteboard babbling like a newborn.<p>Google actually had me do two on-site interviews (one in my hometown and one in Mountain View). The first one went very well. I had a great rapport with the (single) interviewer, and had fun solving the (single) problem he gave me.<p>The Mountain View interview went more or less like the one described in the article. Marathon style. Had good rapport with some of the interviewers, less so with others. Once you start stumbling your confidence starts to fall apart, and it can really hurt you for the rest of the day (the interview lasted all day).<p>I also didn't exactly end up with the job. They offered me a testing position with ""fast-track"" promotion to engineering. I passed on that.<p>Good advice in the article though: practice problems on a whiteboard at home or with friends.

Likewise Python today is a vastly more complicated environment than the language I learned 8 years ago.  And Ruby is quirkier still, taking most of perl's weird syntax and adding an object model from smalltalk and a statement-based execution metaphor that comes straight out of BASIC -- certainly not a ""simple"" language.<p>C is a simple language.  Scheme is a simple language.  Everything else is growing more complicated by the day.",1224954840

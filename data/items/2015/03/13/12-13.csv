I always find this sort of thing fascinating.<p>Here&#x27;s one[0] about when Facebook changed something about their login, and someone wrote a blog post about it. The blog post ended up being top Google result for &quot;facebook login&quot;. A lot of people, it seems, were getting to facebook not by the address bar, but by typing &quot;facebook login&quot; into Google, and clicking whatever the first result was. Hence, they found the site, then proceeded to leave <i>tons</i> of comments, complaining that they couldn&#x27;t log in to FB.<p>[0] <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20120201181225/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20120201181225/http://www.readwr...</a><p>EDIT: This was similar to what happened to rapgenius a bit back.

I believed in the representative democracy (unlike many other techies), I just believed it needed to be improved.<p>I unfortunately came to the conclusion that party politics have completely corrupted the current systems. Over generations the establishment has learned to game the system so perfectly that the elite will remain in charge no matter what happens. Even new &quot;anti-establishment&quot; parties are quickly absorbed or corrupted.<p>I&#x27;ve come to believe that the essence of renewing democracy is <i>change itself</i>. Not because one system is fundamentally better than the other, but because it will break the stranglehold the current political elite has on the existing system.<p>Change is the essential ingredient. Undermine the power of the establish parties by any means necessary, even if that means decision making will initially get &quot;worse&quot;. At least it will be a return to actual democracy.<p>That, and transparency. Pretty much any political system can benefit from much more transparency",1426251457

They had sex again and she realised that he had only put the condom over the tip of his penis, but she let it pass.<p>They went to sleep and she awoke with the sensation of him entering her. She immediately asked &#x27;Are you wearing anything?&#x27; and he replied &#x27;You&#x27;.<p>She told him &#x27;You better not have HIV&#x27; and he replied &#x27;Of course not&#x27;. She felt it was too late, he was already in her so she let him continue, she was too tired to tell him once more, she had been nagging him about using a condom all night.<p>She never had unprotected sex before. He said he wanted to come inside her, he did not say when he would but he did. A lot leaked out of her afterwards.<p>She told him &#x27;What if I get pregnant?&#x27;. He answered that Sweden is a good place to have kids. She jokingly told him that if she became pregnant he would have to pay her student loans.<p>On the train to Enköping he had told her that he had slept in Anna Ardins bed after a party. She asked if he had sex with Anna but he said Anna liked girls, that she was a lesbian.<p>Now she knows that he did the same thing with Anna. She asked him about how many he has had sex with, he responded that he didn&#x27;t keep count. He said that he had HIV tested himself 3 months earlier and that he had sex with a woman after that and that she was tested and not positive.<p>She said sarcastic things to him in a joking tone, she believes that she was trying to de-dramatize what had happened, he in turn did not seem to care. When he was told the size of her student loans he said that if he was to pay her loans then she would have to give birth to a baby.<p>They joked that the child would be named Afghanistan. He also said that he ought to keep abortion-pills with him that would in reality be sugar-pills.<p>His phone rang and he had a meeting with Aftonbladet (swedish newspaper) on tuesday at 12. She explained that he would not make it to that meeting, so he pushed his whole schedule ahead by one hour.<p>After that he rode a bicycle with her on the back down to the train station. She paid his ticket to Stockholm. Before they separated he told her to keep her phone on. She asked if he was going to call and he said he would.<p>She took the bike home, showered and changed sheets. Since she didn&#x27;t make it in time for work she called in sick and stayed home. She wanted to clean up and wash everything. There was semen on the sheets and she thought it was disgusting. She also went by the drugstore and bought &#x27;dagenefterpiller&#x27; (abortion pills).<p>After she had discussed with her friends she realized that she had been the victim of a crime. She went to Danderyd hospital and from there to Södersjukhuset (another hospital). There she was examined and also tested using a so called &#x27;rape-kit&#x27;.</i>",1426251239

9196830,comment,9196467,9196565,0,0,briandear,,,"I would beg to differ on the saving money on taxes. I live in France, I have the $96,000 foreign exclusion, so the first $96,000 I make is US-tax free. I have to pay taxes everything above that no matter where I live.<p>The following is just for informational and entertainment purposes only.<p>So, if I were to hypothetically make $200,000 per year, I would pay US taxes on roughly $104,000 per year, instead of $200,000, plus I get to take deductions. So If I have $20,000 in deductions, I pay taxes on $84,000.<p>When I file my French taxes, my income justification is based on my Adjusted Gross Income on my US tax return since I don&#x27;t make any money from French-EU companies. If I make $200K, have $96K excluded because of the foreign income exclusion, then $20K deductions, my AGI is roughly $84,000. So the $84,000 is my income in terms of France. Now, I get to then take whatever French deductions we are eligible for and pay taxes on whatever the reminder happens to be. Let&#x27;s say that remainder is $80K. I now pay French tax on that $80K, which would be taxed at an effective rate of 22% (the French system is similar to the US in that each &quot;band&quot; of income it taxed at a higher rate with the top marginal rate being 45%.) So that&#x27;s roughly $17K in taxes, which are then dollar-for-dollar deductible from US taxes owed. (That dollar for dollar deduction is based on the US-France tax treaty, so that might not apply to other places.)<p>Let&#x27;s say the approximate effective tax rate of $84K is roughly 22%. That means I&#x27;d owe $17K to the US, but I paid $17K to France, so I pay zero US taxes under this scenario and overall I paid $17K in taxes on $200K in income, which works out to an 8.5% tax rate. This of course would not apply if you earned income from within Europe.<p>If you want to live in the Bahamas and you have an adjusted gross income of $96K or less per year, you&#x27;ll pay zero total taxes. Same for Bahrain, Brunei, Kuwait, British Virgin Islands. But you also have countries that don&#x27;t tax your worldwide income, only income earned within that country. So if you&#x27;re clever and do your research, you will absolutely save money on taxes living outside the United States. You also get the bonus of not paying any state income taxes either. Given the EUR/USD weakness at the moment, there really hasn&#x27;t been a better time to live in the EU if you&#x27;re making US dollars. However, the tax regimes of each country are often very different, so do your homework.",1426250848

The $300k that was asked had been budgeted for a short, simple game that could be made by a small team in a few months.<p>When they got ten times as much funding, it came along with hundred times larger expectations which caused the scope to grow a hundredfold equivalently. Tim&#x27;s fear to meet those expectations caused him to make the game he wanted and knew people expected instead of the one he pitched. Scope grew to include hand-painted art, professional voice overs, orchestral music score, and a much larger team for a longer time so they could make a longer, more polished game. On the first few documentary episodes their struggle to match perceived expectations with the actual budget is clear, and the wishful thinking on estimates and plans also clear in hindsight.<p>All this because it turns out that, after all, $3M is not a large budget for a triple-A game, specially when you remove kickstarter and amazon&#x27;s processing fees, rewards costs and shipping, and the costs of the documentary. Consider a team of developers, designers, artists and animators that are needed to build such game, each costing a conservative estimate of US$100k+/year to the company, then add all external assets and services. The burn rate is big for a project on that scope.<p>All in all, I&#x27;m fairly happy on how it turned out so far, and looking forward to part 2. I back independent games on Kickstarter to encourage the shift on the stagnant producer-driven market and don&#x27;t treat it as a pre-order. Broken Age turned out to be one of the better ones I got (Book of Unwritten Tales 2, Wasteland 2 and Shadowrun Returns were the best ones, Takedown was probably the worst, glad I skipped on Clang).<p>In fact, I think the documentary alone is worth the $30 I dropped in the pledge.

But I fully endorsed your paragraph statement up to but not beyond the remark that a parenthesis is a punctuation. I was not suggesting we don&#x27;t need some kind of punctuation or blank lines in code. I was pointing out Lisp dialects are proof you can basically code with just three signs of punctuations: newlines, left parenthesis and right parenthesis.<p>Are we also clear on the fact every programmer knows how to program in Lisp, even if they didn&#x27;t even program in it? It&#x27;s just like function calls, except for the whole language. Really. There&#x27;s no need to write Lisp code a lot. It is enough to take a few steps back, consider the whole picture and see it for what it is.<p>Lisp is chainable action perimeters. And that&#x27;s very easy because <i>it is just like function calls in C, Java, Javascript</i> or many other, more mainstream languages. If you know one of them - and I bet that&#x27;s the case - then congrats, you can program in Lisp! Whether you choose to do so or not, you&#x27;re the judge of course and either way is fine with me. But don&#x27;t say reading or understanding Lisp is hard because for that you only have to learn the vocabulary, as is the case for every programming language.<p>Anyway, thank you very much for the pointer to SRFI 49! I have searched a bit about indenting Lisp code but never found something that detailed.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for the absurdly fine-grain of my stats. It&#x27;s just that I have my own Lisp code parser for that and it includes inner comments and blank lines. So it&#x27;s really that precise but I was silly to recopy these numbers without thinking about the issue.<p>My point was to say they are <i>consistently</i> that low. And for some languages, it&#x27;s clearly not the case. But from the few codes of Python I have read and given your own stats, it feels like Python is very consistent. And in my eyes that&#x27;s definitely a very good thing.<p>> &quot;Ultimately &quot;no, this language is more awesomer&quot; gets nowhere, I think. You&#x27;re clearly passionate about Lisp and think it is the best.&quot;<p>I just read again my comment and it can so be read like that... I should have been more careful. I&#x27;m truly sorry to have almost versed into a flame debate.<p>But to read my comment in the direction that Lisp is more awesome or simply the best is to amplify too much my claim which was relative to a precise issue: the needed amount of lines of code against the complexity of the problem. I really said nothing more than Lisp has an edge there and I think the examples give an idea of complex problems: parsing code to get a precise line count or to identify dependencies or to even execute automatically step-by-step the code, these are surely complex tasks. At least it is for me and I can&#x27;t imagine coding it in other languages than Lisp. Because of their very syntax.",1426249121

Personally, I feel I&#x27;ve gotten more than 10 times my money&#x27;s worth despite Act 2 not being finished yet.<p>You describe it as massively late, but is that fair? The original plan was &quot;we&#x27;ll make a flash adventure for 300k&quot;, but because of the large budget they changed that to &quot;we&#x27;ll make a cross-platform, voice acted, hand-drawn custom engine game with a longer schedule&quot; and I&#x27;m okay with that.<p>I got to see the entire design and development process behind the screen, which was super neat. I saw the hard discussion on  decreasing scope vs delaying the game, the discussion whether to gut Act 2 or release the first part and use those funds to create an Act 2 worth of the original scope.<p>I think the art, music and voice acting is gorgeous. The puzzles were a bit underwhelming, but everything I&#x27;ve heard is that the difficulty curve is better in Act 2.

All of them. Now.<p>These two issues would be most important to gain some credibility in Europe, where most people still do not accept to have their web privacy delivered to x companies without being asked. This is especially true for a site that offers discussion about political issues - a very heavy fauxpas and you should stop doing anything else and prioritize fixing these issues, these are absolutely vital things for a &quot;democracy enhancing platform&quot;.<p>* I can not download your manifesto pdf without logging into slideshare.<p>Here again I am forced to pay for your pdf by giving user account information. Why are you letting a third party company take your pdf documents as hostages? I am sure your web servers will not die if you just let people download the pdf from e.g.\n<a href=""https://democracyos.org/manifesto.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://democracyos.org/manifesto.pdf</a><p>These things should change before you open your site to the wider public - too many people will see these as proof for &quot;business guys hijacking democracy software market&quot;.",1426248089

Industry isn&#x27;t forcing voters to ignore the voting records of politicians who demonstrate poor integrity.<p>Ultimately, the driver of everything in a democratic republic is the voter.",1426248052

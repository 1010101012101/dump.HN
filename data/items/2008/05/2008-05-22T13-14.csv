Ignoring may past ""donations"" we are taking about 40 years worth taxes and 40 years worth of lost investments.  Granted there is some give and take about such things but 6% over inflation is little on the low side but not unreasonably so.<p>So the basic numbers are 70 * .14 * 1.06^40 = 56k / year in retirement but SS cap's at 1/2 that so at least 1/2 of SS is pure income redistribution for a young person making 70k.<p>Granted if bad things happen SS will help me or my family out, but that's the definition of welfare.  And if I die before 67 I am left with nothing.<p>PS: SS is not just about retirement, but life and disability insurance is cheep and I still pay for it have and I have been paying for over 5 years at this point and 6% over inflation is a vary low number for 40 years.",1211464756

The common answer given by every single one of those people was the answer I give in the article - essentially, contributions to Wikipedia are not something they can put on their CV. One of these people also raised the read / write point you mention, and, for him, it was the more important issue.",1211464660

197110,comment,196025,196269,0,0,Retric,,,"When you talk about such an app it's a good idea to have some basic numbers in mind like .5 second average time to respond to an incoming message and 5seconds worst case. (Picked from thin air but I tend to stick with 1x average 3-10x worst case.)<p>Now as you scale to 50 or so servers they will start to fail with some regularity and you can't reboot and or rebuild in five seconds so we need to have redundant systems ready.  Splitting a shard probably takes longer than five seconds so you need to be proactive about such things. So we need an active rebalancing between shard so they can quickly pass around their load and fast failover incase things fail.  These are DB problems but they are only problems because they system need to keep responding quickly as parts of the DB fail.<p>But this is still DB centric how do you load balance incoming and outgoing requests?  (Routing each existing user to the same system every time and letting each system lock data when they want to change their password etc.) How do we recover from data corruption? How do we notice an outgoing or incoming mail server is down? You also have n^2 number of connections between systems as you grow can we keep that many sockets open? (More of an issue is we are segregating the network.) Etc.<p>PS: These are not hard problems by themselves but they are linked. And there are a lot more where they came from.",1211463710

197104,comment,197064,197064,0,0,jsdalton,,,"Um.<p>I think author is confusing ""programming"" with ""working with code."" His frustrations have more to do with CSS compatibility in browsers than with the actual high-level conceptual thinking that true programming entails.<p>But even taking his argument at face value, his quibbles about syntax would be like me complaining that painting is not a creative art, because that darn paint gets everywhere and it's just so annoying to mix this shade of red and that shade of blue to get the purple I want etc. If you don't enjoy the messy details of the medium, then you surely shouldn't be working in it.<p>For me at least, programming is the very definition of a creative art. I find it not only satisfying to create something out of nothing, but I take pleasure in fleshing out all the little details and overcoming the obstacles that come up along the way.",1211462973

On Windows, it'll use the native Win32 controls, on Linux Mono will ""draw"" controls that look like the native ones without actually calling the native binaries - it allows for a huge compatibility boost and still manages to look 99% native (technically it's drawing the exact same native controls, but the drawings aren't perfect).",1211462935

Sometimes you're so focused on the trees (and leaves and stems) that you forget what forest you're in.  We've all been there.  Sounds like OP is there now.<p>But to develop, you must always be aware of BOTH the forest and trees, constantly shifting focus in and out, like a high priced autofocus zoom lens.  Fall into either mode exclusively and that autofocus muscle in your brain tightens up.<p>Don't worry, OP.

Surely one of the most pointlessly vile and broken (as in the implementations are broken) sub-domains of programming. And in this regard, that he is wasting time, he is right. A good ""web coder"" knows the intricacies of a dozen versions of render engines, but standardisation could, and obviously should, make his knowledge obsolete, as it is only busywork. The wider point is that programming is still full of such busywork.",1211462718

197098,comment,197039,197054,0,0,JesseAldridge,,,"I've been using wxPython for about 6 months now, and I'm pretty happy with it.  It has it's fair share of quirks to get used to, but then all powerful, cross-platfrom gui toolkits do.  It's got a lot of really powerful widgets (there's one that renders simple html, there's one that wraps Scintilla, there's one that let's you use OpenGL, etc).<p>One really cool thing about it is it comes with a demo app that shows how to do almost anything -- how to use the widgets, how to use threads, how to handle events, etc..  It's basically a big collection of small programs.  You can see the code in one tab and see the program in action in another tab.  Here's a couple screenshots:<p><a href=""http://crookedgames.com/wx_python_demo_action.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crookedgames.com/wx_python_demo_action.png</a><p><a href=""http://crookedgames.com/wx_python_demo_code.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crookedgames.com/wx_python_demo_code.png</a><p>Yet another cool thing about it is Robin Dunn, its maintainer.  He seems to go through the mailing list every day or two, and answers most questions that people have.  He's been maintaining the project for a long time and knows what's up.  Maybe I shouldn't be advertising him as tech support, but I've received helpful assistance from him more than once :)",1211462555

197090,comment,197064,197064,0,0,DougBTX,,,"There does seem to be a distinction between programming as art, and programming as plumbing. Most programming probably falls into the latter category. But even when plumbing, you don't check that the water flows through each joint as it is fitted by turning on the tap. I assume the author doesn't send his article to his editor every time he places a full stop.<p>Perhaps when you are forced to check yourself at every turn, when small mistakes cannot be ignored and instead become hard walls to progress, that's when creativity is stifled. When writing an article, small spelling  mistakes can be corrected in the second draft, but the ideas are already on paper and can be exchanged with others.<p>It all comes back to flow, transcending the mundane to imagine the creative. And so to the question implied in the article: is there something inherent to programming which inhibits flow?<p>I see three possibilities. 1) The programmer becomes an expert, and so transcends the distraction of small mistakes simply by not making small mistakes. 2) The programmer chooses an environment which either tolerates, ignores or fixes small mistakes, whether through postponing compile time errors to run time, or by automated refactoring to always leave the code ready to compile. Or finally, 3) the programmer simply never gets into the flow, and as with the author, creativity is void.",1211461283

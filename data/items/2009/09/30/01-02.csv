Currently, you find the use of ""gender"" confused with the use of ""sex.""  Over time ""gender"" will probably come be used generally for male/female, and sex for reproductive references.  But the first such uses were non-standard.<p>Perhaps it's best to leave it at, ""know your audience.""",1254275627

851737,comment,851168,851685,0,0,eli,,,"Cache invalidation is a deceptively difficult problem.<p>The direct answer is because it's pretty difficult to figure out how an insert/update/delete is going to affect all the various queries stored in the cache... without running them all again. And of course you're not going to rerun all the queries again on the off chance you might need them in the future; you're just going to throw them out of the cache and regenerate them the next time they're needed.<p>Note that this seems like an unfair comparison. I don't think many people consider MySQL's transparent query cache a substitute for the (not transparent) Memcache. Better would be memcache versus using a regular table in a MySQL DB as a cache (many popular PHP CMSes do this).",1254275279

Even TechCrunch shoots out an email so they can say that they asked the company what their side is.<p>If you're really searching for the truth, you should have approached them and asked, especially since your title is a question and you have this line in your post:<p><i>I can’t figure out why 37 Signals would be selling this information to ad networks.</i><p>Your post is making an implication that something nefarious is going on, without actually having the guts to come out and say it.  Instead, you pretend to be confused, and state that you're really not sure what's going on.

FYI, girls don't play football because most girls are too weak and slow to play (for biological reasons). Regarding ballet, men are actively encouraged to join ballet due to the fact that ballet (unlike coding) has explicit male/female roles and a shortage of men willing to fill those roles.<p>In any case, I'm not criticizing, just pointing out a bad argument.

That is not the goal of the statement Feynman is proposing.  It is to contain the most information in the fewest words.  The non-existence of God isn't information like the atomic hypothesis is.",1208591713

I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that <i>all things are made of atoms — little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another...</i>\n[/QUOTE]<p>Wrong. The one sentence to pass on (with the understanding that it is automatically <i>believed</i>) is this: There is no god, therefore look elsewhere for truth.",1208591167

Before iPaper, getting casual users to view a PDF or doc was brutal because it added another layer of complexity.<p>The user had to be able to understand and navigate an outside application, and what's worse, had to have the desire and memory to return to your website afterwards. iPaper simplifies the whole process and is worlds better than Acrobat Reader in terms of speed and simplicity.",1208590749

You can debate good faith all day, but MS of 10 years ago would never have released those documents to the EU.<p>There is that rift, sure, but I'm fairly sure they see it very clearly as a feature.

He says that redistribution of income will make us (those with ""too much"" income) happier because it will narrow our choices. But it won't. The great thing about money is that you can buy anything with it, including the reduction in number of choices. The cachet for many companies (e.g. Apple, Costco) is exactly that: consistently high quality and limited selection. \nAnd it always costs extra.<p>My biggest motivation for getting rich is not having to deal with insignificant (but unavoidable if you're poor) everyday problems. Being forced to choose is mostly a subset of those problems.",1208589807

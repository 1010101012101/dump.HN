The point of my comment was simply to point out that ""our universe is deterministic"", full stop, isn't a warranted premise by current evidence.  If you only meant ""adequately deterministic"" by ""deterministic"", fine and dandy.  However, I don't know anything that actually stops the two causal chains A and B in my thought experiment from being macroscopically very different.  So skipping the ""adequately"", I feel, gives those not familiar with the details a misleading impression that we can unproblematically think of ourselves as just in the old clockwork universe.

She may have hung on too tight to that vision at times, but I'd take that any day over a co-founder who was aimless and did not know what they wanted.  We were up against a very difficult, entrenched industry, and she made as good of progress as I could expect any new entrepreneur to make.<p>I too am a bit disappointed in Bloomberg.  The fact of the matter is that you have a lot of strong, driven entrepreneurs in the same program, and while some of what you saw is accurate, Bloomberg really made an effort to polarize and make extreme the various personality types.  Reece does not <i>always</i> talk about sports or use athlete analogies.  Jason Baptiste doesn't walk around constantly saying he'll own the internet (although if you prod him for it, he'll probably say it), and Melanie is not clueless.

Instead of a contrived puzzle they were working on production code. It was great! And since they all worked on the same bug, I was able to score them on a ten point scale for easy comparison.<p>We've started another hiring round, and this time I didn't have any good Python bugs at hand. What to do? Open source! We use the CherryPy framework a fair bit here (the maintainer is on our team). So this round I am pairing up for an hour of work on CherryPy. It moves an open source project forward, it's cleaner than having people work on proprietary code, and we still get a great picture of each candidate. Win all over the place. This time I am inviting candidates to share their screen with me rather than vice versa. Last time I tried at least installing the person's editor of choice, but there's no place like ~, ya know? Another thing that happened last time is that by the end of the interviews I had gone through the exercise so many times that it felt much less like pair programming and much more like thumb-screwing. At the expense of a neat scoring system, I am not going to go over the same ground this time. I already updated one CherryPy ticket, and we'll keep chipping away at that one and others. I expect some level of familiarity with Python and its tools, but I'm happy to teach you what I know. A nice side-effect is that I get to learn what you know too. :^)<p>We've got three spots open and we're just starting interviews, so if you'd like to pair together for an hour on CherryPy, hit me up at chad.whitacre@yougov.com.",1319136614

One major detail I would change is to make it a $100,000 or $50,000 minimum instead of $500,000. There are many parts of the country where it's hard to even find a house that's as expensive as $250,000. I'd like something like this to be open to all parts of the country and I'd like it to be open to middle class as well, not just wealthy people.<p>Why do I like it?<p>* Fill vacant homes (as opposed to urban blight)<p>* There are many indirect economic benefits like money spent fixing homes, all the day to day purchasing that will be done by the new residents, etc.<p>* In some cases, individuals will be able to rejoin relatives more easily.<p>The urban blight thing is the one I care about most. I live in the East Bay of California and have seen certain neighborhoods totally fall apart as dozens of vacant homes attracted vandalism, drugs, and other forms of crime and caused remaining residents hardship.<p>EDIT: formatting",1319136489

Needs are things that we can't do without. Basic (cheap) transportation, is a ""need"" for many people, but it doesn't represent the type of marketing shift that the author outlines in the article. I'd turn the statement on it's head:<p>GM had figured out how to take a product which solved a problem  cheap transportation  and transform it into an object of lust.<p>The message is the same. I don't think I disagree entirely with what Steve is saying, but I found the use of the term ""need"" jarring in that context.<p>I think Apple's formula is a mixture of the ""bigger fins"" strategy, as well as genuine product enhancements. If you buy a phone for ""needs"" (cheap communication), I'm not sure you're buying an iPhone. You buy an iPhone (or any smartphone) because you want more than the basic needs. In some cases, people buy them simply as jewelry, but I think that angle is way overplayed. A pre-requisite for the ""jewelry"" claim is that the owner not utilize the phone for its actual utilitarian features (apps, browsing, email, camera, video, mms, etc). I'm sure the jewelry aspect comes in to play getting people in the door, but I'm not sure they stay that way for long.",1319136311

There is nothing wrong with keeping him on  -on a rev share basis, but be sure you know what you are getting.<p>If he doesn't want a cash up-front buyout and just wants nothing to do with the app anymore, just keep his 50% share alive up until a max of the agreed upon future earnings of the app, as is.<p>However, if you are planning on keeping the app going, any agreement has to codify the terms of your relationship, contingent on accepting the buyout (consult an attorney).  Who knows where things will go in the future and who else you will be bringing on-board.<p>If you are on good terms, coming up with a number shouldn't be a big deal.

3136064,comment,3134339,3135620,4,0,alexqgb,,,"Thank you for making this point so vividly. Nothing is more infuriating that attempting to discuss ethics with people who are congenitally dishonest in their choice of language. It's like trying to discuss good-grooming with a person who's got a stained shirt, dirt under their fingernails, and an open fly. Instant credibility killer.<p>I think the real problem is that folks arguing form this position really don't want to admit that tangible goods and intangible goods are very different things, that they both demand their own governing codes, and (critically) these codes have very little overlap, either conceptually or practically.<p>Ultimately, this whole ""duplication is theft"" comes across as a giant land-grab. Thanks to technological developments, we've seen explosive growth in the realm of intangible goods. The folks in the IP business (who did next to nothing in creating this new state) would like us to ignore the fact that the laws governing IP were written before the internet existed. And they'd like us to pretend that those laws would be exactly the same had they been written after the emergence of the internet. Accordingly, we should just transpose our legal code from one sphere to another, and expect everything to work perfectly.<p>Never mind that the application of this law in the new sphere leads to instant conflicts with the underlying authority on which the initial law was based. Ignore, too, the fact that enforcement, to be effective, must involve surveillance with an absolutely nauseating ubiquity (itself a clearly illegal proposition). And pretend - for a moment - that this is really incidental regulation, not something that has a determining role in the fundamental architecture of the internet.<p>In short, pretend that's it's possible to discover fire, but legislate away some of the heat.<p>But there's more to it than not wanting to see a new code that's not as favorable to distributers as the old code. What folks making the ""copyright is theft"" argument would also like us to ignore is the degree to which our political system has been captured and undermined by private lobbies - a very nasty development that is presently generating a larger crisis of legitimacy that threatens everything Congress touches - including the old code.<p>Having already spent millions to (legally) bribe congresspeople, the folks saying ""theft!"" know they are deeply, deeply wrong. They know they represent a corrupting influence in America life. They know that they depend on a set of rules that have become odious. And they want - desperately - to avoid any clear conversation about this. Ergo, you see the constant effort to confuse the meaning of words, to ignore the actual scope and wording of the law, and - above all - to avoid any reckoning with the fundamental premise that allows the issuance of copyrights in the first place.<p>Well, they're not the only ones who can set the rules of engagement. And I think the first rule that honest people should insist on is the accurate and precise use of language.<p>I realize that this small bit of honesty is, itself, a threat to those who would use ""theft"" to describe unauthorized duplication. The fact that they're willing to fiercely defend their tendency to abuse semantics should signal just how thin the ice under them really is. I mean, if you can't have a conversation without warping  the meaning of the words you use, is it because you don't actually have anything to say? Or are you worried that the whole edifice you've built is so fragile that the slightest crack will cause the entire thing to implode?<p>Here's a bit of advice: stop worrying. It's already too late. The old order has already failed. What we're living in now is an Interregnum - the period of limbo that exists between the end of one system, and the point where a new system is strong enough to sweep away the remaining dregs. I'll be the first to agree that this is a very difficult time for artists caught in the crossfire. I mean, the old system can no longer protect them, while the new system cannot yet provide for them. It's awful. But that's reality.  All anyone can hope to do is hold on long enough to ride out the disruption stemming from what is, by any measure, a tremendous historical development.<p>So onward through the fog.",1319134329

Finagle is a framework for building asynchronous RPC systems (e.g., services or APIs with transports over HTTP or Thrift), and Ordasity is a library for cluster membership, load balancing, and distribution.<p>Twitter's put together a nice toolkit atop Netty for building reliable services and describing communication between them. These services are generally stateless and might be balanced by something like HAProxy (when using an HTTP transport), or via a round-robin approach in the case of Thrift clients.  A closer comparator for Finagle would be something like Scalang, our library for building hybrid Erlang / Scala distributed systems (though it's also excellent for pure-Scala systems as well): <a href=""https://github.com/boundary/scalang"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/boundary/scalang</a><p>Ordasity is designed for describing stateful clusters in which individual nodes are responsible for claiming longer-lived work units -- think of it in terms of ""a processing shard"" of the system's total load. The library's primary goals are to help you:<p>- Describe the cluster in simple terms such that when each node comes online, it joins the cluster and is aware of all other nodes (and vice versa)<p>- Distribute work across the cluster by directing each node to claim an even ""count"" of work units or ""even distribution"" of the total load imposed by those work units.<p>- Automatically rebalance work units across nodes in the cluster as the amount / intensity of work or cluster topology changes.<p>- And gracefully manage maintenance or downtime scenarios by draining work units to another node.<p>In the end, Ordasity and Finagle are both tools for building distributed systems on the JVM. However, the types of systems they're designed to describe are a bit different. Hope that helps; let me know if you'd like me to clarify something.",1319133837

3136001,comment,3134577,3135705,8,0,hexagonc,,,"I don't think Kurzweil ignores economics at all.  In fact, many of his arguments are largely based on economics, such as the cost to obtain a given amount of computation.  It is undeniable that this has gone down steadily with time.  Computation is so cheap that cloud computing (e.g., E2C, Azure) allows individual developers access to more computing than most know what to do with.<p>Your example of the MacBook Air is invalid because the MacBook Air of today isn't priced principally on performance -- it is priced mostly by build quality and performance/watt/kilogram.  Never before have computers had a better performance/watt/kilogram profile.  You have to consider the whole package.<p>The argument that there is less need for performance is also flawed.  It is not that humans have less need for computation, it's that the distribution of computation is changing.  As mentioned before, a lot of computation is moving to the cloud.  In many cases, this is simply the most efficient place for it to be; instead of having an abundance of computation sitting mostly unused on a laptop or desktop, computation is becoming a service where it is used on demand.  Think of the computation required for cloud services like speech to text processing or Google Goggles.  Most of the computation is farmed out the servers in cloud and only minimal.<p>I'm not even sure I agree that the decrease in local computational needs is a long term trend.  For one thing, migration to the cloud can only continue as long as network bandwidth keeps up with cloud data demands.  If network bandwidth is not able to keep up then I predict we'll see local computational needs spike again.<p>Even with some computation siphoned off to the cloud, AI will create a whole new class of applications for even local computation because it is so data intensive.  When the next crop of AI applications emerge and become more common, the early algorithms will probably be inefficient, which will itself cause a spike in computational needs.  The applications are here yet but there are many (including myself) that are working hard to change that.",1319133767

I am talking impossible-as-in-perpetual-motion.<p>Nice well-behaved linear Newtonian systems can be modeled and predicted. There are systems that are chaotic but that can be modeled in the aggregate very well too, like thermodynamic systems and certain kinds of fluid flow.<p>Life isn't like any of that. Life is complex, chaotic, computationally irreducible, and full of feedback loops on top of feedback loops. Even worse: predictions often create economic incentives to prove them wrong. Take a position on the stock market and you have created an incentive for your prediction to <i>not</i> come true.<p>People have always wanted to deny the fundamental unpredictability of history, and have always clung to woo-woo prophecy superstitions toward this end. The ancients had Tarot cards and pig entrails. We have graphs and computer models.",1319133667

If acquaintances include the boyfriend of someone you somewhat knew in high school, then my use of a pseudonym that I had never used before worked for acquaintances while using facebook. What it didn't work for was people who simply had my name but didn't know any of my friends and/or were not specifically invited by me in facebook or real life to become my friend.<p>If you were looking for a guy who had my real name on facebook, you were out of luck. If you noticed one of your friends having a conversation with me, and asked who I was and knew me/recognized who I was due to the content of the conversation/recognized me as likely someone you might want to know based on your sampling of my adjacent nodes and my public content, you would have been able to find me.<p>>""There is enormous value to me in having people's names online be discoverable and searchable by the name that I actually know them by.""<p>Not everybody wants to be discoverable in the same way. I may not want you to be able to find me just because you know my name. Maybe I want to avoid old one night stands/people I did drugs with/people I was in prison with/the obsessed schizophrenic who lives in my building and rely on my current network of friends and serendipity to populate my friend list.<p>I think the most important question is whether you are tolerant or intolerant towards that - noting that even if you do require real names, you won't be able to find mine anyway, because I won't be there. That question addressed to google or facebook is: ""Are you still interested in me as a customer if you can't track me after I've left your system?""<p>If the answer if ""No,"" you may not be evil, but you're certainly creepy.",1319133667

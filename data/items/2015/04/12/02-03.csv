Marriage isn&#x27;t a right, it&#x27;s a privilege granted by society to try to promote nuclear families. They get tax breaks, etc. at the expense of anyone who doesn&#x27;t prefer that family structure.<p>Ideally, these rights could be assigned piecemeal between any two individuals, with non-exclusion (i.e., polyamory is allowed.) Perhaps my spouse isn&#x27;t the best at difficult decisions, and I&#x27;d prefer my stable son to be able to make difficult medical decisions, like whether I should be kept on life support. Perhaps I would like to file taxes jointly with my roommate for two years, if we shared household expenses.<p>In no way is granting gay marriage some kind of rights equalization, but an expansion of an already unfair system, so I oppose it, just as if white people could own black people, but not vice versa, I would not be in favor of allowing black people to own white people, and would oppose any such measure, while being in favor of real equalization by abolishing the system of anybody owning anybody.",1428807050

I was didn&#x27;t work on the iPhone at all.<p>Next up you had games, which also didn&#x27;t work on the iPhone. Games basically all assumed a mouse and keyboard so the chances of them actually working well if you try to play them on an iPhone would&#x27;ve been terrible anyway.<p><pre><code>  A highly despised use with advertising. Thanks to the incredible power of flash not only could pop ups be made, but you could have dancing around little distracting graphics with lots of sound and even video sucking up all your bandwidth. \n</code></pre>\nLast you had online video, which was fixed by the built-in YouTube app and Apple&#x27;s pushing for HTML5 and HTML live streaming.<p>But the most important thing you have to remember is that flash absolutely sucked down resources.  On a (at the time) recent laptop you could easily tell when a website loaded flash.  Not only did things respond better with flash off but battery life could be significantly affected. You could get extra hours on your computer. And if you think flash on windows was bad, you should&#x27;ve tried living in the Macintosh ecosystem.  Adobe clearly didn&#x27;t care so flash performance was drastically worse.<p>If it was bad on a laptop, you know how much worse it would&#x27;ve been on the original iPhone.

Even if flash could&#x27;ve been put on them, I doubt it would&#x27;ve been performant at all for real content.<p>I think Apple was completely correct. I had already started using a flash blocker by that point just so my laptop wouldn&#x27;t get too hot and drain the battery too fast. There were better ways to do video, answer now less of noxious since they can&#x27;t play sound, and games run better than ever \nsince they are apps.<p>Incredible popularity of the iPhone and the iPad was the thing that finally put flash out of its misery you. It should&#x27;ve died long before that for being so on optimized but no one else had enough power to do it. Apples move did more than anything else to get us into the modern HTML5 Web 2.0 world.

For example for one brand there can be multiple versions of the same logo that are slightly different.<p>So a good example would be the AT&T death star logo. First there are several versions of the logo that have been modified over the years. Then even if you look at one release (say when the death star was first introduced) the color version will be different than the black-and-white version (and sometimes there is a grayscale version).<p>There may be different versions of the logo done for different sizes, so the logo that goes on a truck is not the same logo that goes on a business card. There may also be different layouts for the logo playing with the placement of the symbol and the logotype.<p>Another problem in the digital age is the ability of non-designers to muck up a logo. I&#x27;ve seen people distort the proportions of the logo because they don&#x27;t use the shift key when resizing. And of course sometimes non-designers even feel &quot;creative&quot; and start to play with a logo.<p>Also not all logos are what you&#x27;d call &quot;cookie cutter logos&quot; some are full color illustrations (think Quaker Oats, Mister Clean or Aunt Jemima).<p>Lastly one trend I&#x27;ve noticed from the digital era is that thanks to sites like 99designs there are quite a few people who think that they have an original logo, but it&#x27;s in fact been copied from an award annual or recycled by the &quot;designer&quot;.<p>So the task isn&#x27;t as black and white as some people believe...",1428805922

This will never happen. The government is always going to assert that your rights are contingent on the government&#x27;s ability to violate those rights if it thinks it has sufficient cause according to some standard. Many of you are arguing that the government should completely give up that ability for regular crime that probably happens thousands of times across the country every day.<p>You are now thinking, what about encryption, PGP, passphrases, I have a legal right to not have to give those up, don&#x27;t I? Yes, we are very lucky that in the United States the Supreme Court has decided that you don&#x27;t have to give up a password. But this was because it used to be that a password didn&#x27;t actually protect very much and the legal system hasn&#x27;t caught up yet. Lock combinations are meaningless when the government can just crack the safe, and passwords to email are meaningless when they can just compel the email service to cough up the mail. The court&#x27;s aware of PGP, but the times it actually hasn&#x27;t been able to get the data through other means is currently small so it&#x27;s still not worth the political battle. When the device that most people can carry around in their pockets is sufficiently secure that nobody can get the contents without compelling the owner to give up the passphrase, legislation will be introduced for backdoor access or the Supreme Court will rule that you have to give up the passphrase. That is why device LE access is, believe it or not, a compromise. They are willing to overlook nerds using PGP because that&#x27;s still niche, but encrypted unbreakable devices are an existential threat to the government&#x27;s ability to control everyone&#x27;s life for good or for ill.<p>I still think it needs to be fought as long as possible, but I am under no illusions that we will ultimately lose.",1428804505

Rather, it&#x27;s a fundamental tenant of libertarianism that you should not use the organ of government to enforce your religious views on others.<p>On numerous occasions, Paul has referenced religious motivations for creating social policies.

The real debate about abortion is over when life that deserves protecting begins. There is nothing else anyone disagrees with. If the fetus was an animal PETA would be the only ones having issue; if the fetus was dead noone would have issue with removing it. Some people believe that because a baby is not yet outside its mother, it has no rights. Other believe that until a baby is named, it has no rights. That is what the issue is about, and thinking otherwise you might as well not engage because you will go in circles all day.<p>As far as same-sex marriage, Rand Paul thinks it is not the federal government&#x27;s responsibility to regulate that. Removing regulation over social issues from government IS a very libertarian philosophy.",1428804038

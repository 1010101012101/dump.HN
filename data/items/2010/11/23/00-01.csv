Before someone comments that ""the airlines don't have jurisdiction over the TSA"", I would simply remind everyone that the airline lobbyists are very powerful in Washington and have been complicit with the new procedures. When the airlines feel the heat financially, they'll see the light. Regarding John Pistole's recent tough talk, I predict that he'll fold by Christmas.",1290473998

A person is seized when a reasonable person in that situation would feel that they are not free to leave. Normally, seizure requires a warrant, but there are exceptions, all of which I think require that the seizing officer have probable cause that a crime has been committed and the person who committed the crime is the one being seized.<p>By asking the police officer if he was free to go, the traveler was triggering this kind of analysis in the officer's head. The officer knows that he cannot seize without probable cause. He can probably temporarily <i>detain</i> the traveler while the TSA investigate the situation, but ultimately, if there's no probable cause, the traveler must be allowed to leave.",1290473946

When asked why he was refusing to be searched, his answers (in his own writing) seemed to be along the lines of, ""because I don't feel like it."" I'm sorry, but that's just not really a valid defense. Whether you feel it's constitutional or not, the law says you have to go through these checkpoints when selected. If you're going to refuse, you need to have a much better reason than you don't feel like it.<p>Ultimately, it sounded to me like they escorted him out of the terminal simply because they were tired of dealing with him, not because he found a loophole in their logic or rules.

For some reason, they remain very focused on airplanes (maybe the shock and awe effect).  As a result, taking steps to make air travel as safe as possible seems reasonable.<p>Now - how we do that is an open question.  We have already had an underwear bombing attempt.  How do we prevent this from being attempted again?  The only solution I have seen is the current scanners and sadly the ""pat down"".  If there is a better one, lets deploy it.

Although my judgement is probably not reliable because the only thing I have to compare against is a 4 year old laptop with a dual core centrino processor.<p>Usability-wise, there are a few things:<p>* Keys like ctrl-pageup aren't easily accessible. That's common to all laptops > 14"", which is unfortunate. I got around that by configuring the terminal emulator to switch tabs with Ctrl-Shift-H and Ctrl-Shift-L. (On the other hand, none of the macbooks I've seen has the home/end/page-up/page-down readily accessible either).<p>* The trackpad goes crazy sometimes. This is a given for most laptops (well, except Macbooks). I use touchfreeze to mitigate that.<p>* The microphone is right next to the trackpad, not good for recording a live streamcast, unless you have an external wireless mouse.<p>* The proprietry ATI driver is not that good, the open-source driver is better. (I found it somewhat ironic). Nvidia would've probably been better. HD videos don't necessarily play as smoothly as I'd imagined they would. You'll see some tearing on xfce, but gnome on compiz looks fine.<p>It does generate a lot of heat so I try not to put it on my lap a lot.<p>But don't let that discourage you.<p>It's a great laptop, it's not too heavy and it's got a LED screen, which means the picture will look good regardless of your viewing angle.<p>While not as pretty as a Macbook, it does have a clean and elegant design.<p>I wouldn't exactly recommend it as an entertainment platform, but that's not why I bought it. I bought it because I wanted a powerful machine that's not too bulky. I wanted a machine that I can move around, get work done on it, and have it be powerful so that it doesn't slow me down.<p>It can run virtual machines without sacrificing performance (that's a big one).<p>It can apt-get install stuff without taking too long to read the database (my old laptop used to spend a long time in ""(Reading database ...."").<p>It can run tons of programs without ever slowing down.

1931954,comment,1930377,1931659,0,0,zach,,,"Sure.  Transactions of authority are those things we all know are there -- these stepping stones towards building a relationship.<p>Okay, first, ""authority"" has cultural baggage, because ""authority"" sounds formal and institutional and the thing you're supposed to question.  But it also embraces opinion, influence and respect.  It's the same word as trustedness, so if you want you could use that, but I'll stick with authority.<p>So on one side, there is some measure of vulnerability, as you said.  It could be very small, like asking a question.  It's anything that contradicts the thesis that ""I know what's right, I can do it and I don't need you.""  Asking a question, asking for help, offering an opinion for validation, revealing one's own flaws or willingly showing incompetence are all acts which negate that thesis.<p>On the other side, there needs to be a willingness to accept the truthfulness of the transaction and the responsibility of bearing the costs involved in completing the transaction.  If it's something I can do that makes me feel good about myself, helps someone I love and doesn't cost me much, I am going to be thrilled to do it.  If it's someone I don't know asking me to go buy booze for them in a 7-Eleven with a $100 bill, not so much.<p>But trust is the number one factor, and the first step up in trust is huge.  Going from zero (complete stranger) to ten (decent person I don't know) is a lot easier than going from ten to twenty.  That's why first impression, and particularly the first transaction of authority, is huge, because if you go to negative ten first, you are in a serious hole.  If you're a website, that's when the user goes for the back button anyway.<p>Understanding how to build a relationship is understanding how and when to handle these transactions of authority.  This is why rejection therapy is a useful exercise -- the one who gets rejected knows how far to jump next time better than the one who never skips a step.<p>This also provides a framework for understanding what are otherwise ""social hacks"" as constructive, proper and polite ways to interact.  It's useful to know that ""can I cut in line so I can make some copies"" is not just exploiting some neurobug but offering a different transaction -- Can I offer you the status of ""someone who helped me out when I was unable to do something all by myself"" in exchange for a cut in line?<p>You can even argue Ben Franklin was being polite rather than a jerk when he asked to borrow a book from someone he wanted to build a relationship with.  Even though he didn't really care about the book, and it was a tactic, he was offering a polite transaction and was building a friendly relationship, which he at least always saw as a greater good.  I'm not sure about that one, but you can at least see the broader context this way.<p>Transactions of authority are what build a relationship not just between two people but in communities.  Similarity is nice, but even small transactions of authority are better.",1290473389

But no, that won't help with this attack (the filter works only on HEAD and GET methods, and this attack is about the content after a POST).<p>It looks like this filter deals with reducing the CPU required to handle the request portion of an initial HTTP connection. I suppose this could help with preventing the server from being starved of resources for an attack on solely transmitting an HTTP request, but that could be mitigated by a 5 or 10 second timeout on getting a HEAD/GET request from the client initially (which should be reasonable even for dial-up and mobile connections). And I personally haven't ever seen a DoS attack on a proxy layer that ate up more CPU than any other resource, so I don't see this filter as being a significant advantage over the basic tuning you can do with connections on the proxies.<p>Oh, and as tptacek mentioned, a reverse proxy like varnish can definitely help in different DoS scenarios. I haven't used varnish in the real world so I can't speak to specific advantages, but in general, dedicated reverse proxies are a great way to offload initial processing, provide more resources for a high number of connections and deal with host-level attack mitigation so the app servers don't have to waste time on it.",1290473197

The point is that people in these threads are assuming the video gives more facts than it does.<p>The only relevant factors I see are how they acquired the test bank and how the instructor communicated the nature of the exam.  Neither of these factors are actually that easy to determine from the video.  On one hand, the very existence of the test bank isn't something the instructor should feel either has to be divulged, if he has a reasonable expectation that it is supposed to stay private, or explicitly informed to the students that it's off limits.  On the other, this is also a possible scenario: that some students reasonably assumed past or public exam material was fair game; encountered the test bank publicly (or acquired it from someone else thinking that they got it legitimately); used it to study; thought, upon seeing the exam contained some of the same questions, that they had studied from the right material; and only realized it afterwards, even as late as when the instructor revealed the extent of the incident, then felt compelled to confess.  Is it likely it happened with all the confessors?  Probably not.  Is it possible and plausible it may have happened with some of them?  Certainly.  Presumably, all the confessions were in private, some possibly anonymous.",1290472621

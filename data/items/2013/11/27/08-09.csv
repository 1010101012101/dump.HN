I certainly have one with a very competitive salary and excellent co-workers.

6807059,comment,6805958,6805958,2,0,graycat,,,"> At a point in history when self tutoring often provides more than the average Graduate course, it blows my mind how difficult it can be to get into a Masters program.<p>Things to consider:<p>(1) Take the GRE tests for both aptitude and your\nspeciality.  Really good scores will be tough to\nignore.  And if your speciality is in a STEM field,\nthen you get to f&#x27;get about all the English literature,\nhistory, etc. and your grades in those nonsense subjects.<p>(2) Emphasize points of success in your career.  Why?\nBecause you will look like you are taking your career\nseriously and might later in your career be able to\nmake significant financial contributions to the university.\nYes, Virginia, universities like rich students!<p>(3) As in the quote, do some independent study.  Then\nin your application, describe the significant books\nand journal papers you have studied.  You may be doing\nenough independent study now just for your career.<p>(4) Get the description of the Ph.D. qualifying\nexams.  Mostly the coursework for a Master&#x27;s and\nfor preparation for the exams are similar.  So,\njust study the darned material on your own, apply\nto the Ph.D. program, and offer to sit for the\nqualifying exams before being admitted.  Offer tough\nto turn down.<p>Note, at one time the Web site of the Princeton\nmath department just flatly stated that the graduate\ncourses were introductions to research by experts,\nno courses were given for preparation for the qualifying\nexams, and students were expected to prepare for these\nexams on their own.  So, do it, on your own, without\ngoing to campus.<p>That you successfully prepared for the qualifying exams\non your own is big time impressive and a big point\nfor any graduate program because one of the basic\nnecessary conditions for success in a Ph.D. program\nis good ability at independent study.  So, showing\nsuch ability can make a graduate department really\nhappy, i.e., no longer afraid they will have to\nwrite your dissertation for you.<p>(5) Find a problem, maybe at work, that needs\nsolving and get a good solution, both in theory\nand in practice.  Write a paper and submit it\nfor publication in a peer-reviewed journal or\na conference.<p>If are unsure on just how to do\nthis, then find a friendly Ph.D., researcher,\nprofessor to give you the <i>101 Big Secrets \nThey Never Taught You in College on\nHow Get a Paper Published</i> or some such.<p>Pretend to look for a recommendation of a\nsuitable journal and write to a suitable \nprofessor in the program you want to enter\nand send a copy of your paper.  So,\n<i>prime the pump</i> via a backdoor.  If he\nlikes your paper, then it can be that all\nthe rest goes quickly.  E.g., once I applied\nto a graduate program at Cornell and got\nturned down.  It happened that there was a prof there\nI wanted to talk to about a problem I had\nat work and flew up.  We took a campus tour,\nand back at his office I showed him my problem\nand my progress on it.  Suddenly I got another\nletter from the department admissions saying\nI was in.  I didn&#x27;t go.  Via such things I \nalso got into Brown, Princeton, and Hopkins.\nI went to Hopkins.<p>(6) Typically a STEM department has a\nseminar series.  These can be painful as\na toothache because you may be listening\nto stuff you don&#x27;t have the prerequisites\nto understand.  But they can also be good\nbecause they can, on a good day, give you\nsome great help in picking a research problem.<p>Well, typically such seminars are open to the\npublic, and maybe also the department tea\nbefore the seminar.  So, crash the party\nand meet some of the profs and/or graduate\nstudents.  From the students, get some of the\n&#x27;low down&#x27; -- they can be quite helpful to\na fellow suffering human.<p>You need to know that graduate school, really,\nis not much about learning.  Instead, the three\nmost important aspects are research, research,\nand research, as in &quot;new, correct, and significant&quot;\nand/or &quot;worthy of publication&quot;.  For a prof,\nwhat&#x27;s important is research good enough to\nget a good grant, e.g., from the NSF.  E.g.,\nthat Princeton Web site didn&#x27;t even want to\nteach basic material and only wanted students\nto get involved in research; the assumption is\nthat hard part was doing the research, not\nfinding, reading, and understanding it in the\nlibrary.<p>As a graduate student, do\nsome work that is nice and clearly publishable,\nespecially if you publish it,\nand can suddenly find that\nlife in the department gets much nicer.<p>Finally, my <i>Secret Guide to Research Success in\nSTEM Fields</i> is, &quot;be wise, mathematize&quot;.  Basically\nget an ugrad math major with emphasis on topics\nthat can be important in the other STEM fields\nand then make the research basically\nsome new theorems and proofs.  It&#x27;s worked for\nme.<p>For the admissions office, try to f&#x27;get about\nthem!  They just can&#x27;t be the brightest bulbs\non the tree.",1385539714

Anarchists, at least those who endorse free market enterprise, believe in rules. However, they see government as an ultimate monopoly that issues rules and enforces them with unchallengeable force. If you agree with me that monopolies are not good for consumers, then it only takes a little step further to see that government is indeed a monopoly. Why does it have to say who can marry whom, who can smoke what and who can buy what? The alternative isn&#x27;t living in the woods. The alternative is having a polylegal system and private protection agencies. You choose an agency and a package of rules you like and start paying. If you dislike the services - you unsubscribe and stop paying, you don&#x27;t wait for the next election. Moving to a different country cannot be considered a true alternative, since it&#x27;s usually complicated, expensive and you still are forced (not asked) to pay, like it or not.<p><i>> None of these companies operate in a vacuum.

Today it is extremely easy to attract VC/angel money!<p>If founders are unwilling to accept new money because of greed, valuation too low, contingencies, etc... then yes maybe it is a fair gamble to work for equity... Like if you knew your startup had 99% chance of being acquired in 3 month at 5x over today&#x27;s valuation, then equity pay makes sense.<p>However, it does not seem like the case here. Highly likely that all VC/angels had passed,.. hence, follow the money and look for an exit.<p>To make it easier to decide: ask founders to explain why they cannot raise money. If they bring low valuation as an excuse, ask to show termsheets and make judgement upon that. If they cannot provide this proof - run.",1385539380

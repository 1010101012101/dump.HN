Look at a game like super meat boy, which imo has control's even better then the mario games(which is saying quite a bit.) They spent A LOT of time just experimenting and fine tuning because they completely make or break the game. Anyone that played super meat boy knows exactly what i'm talking about the, the game would just be too frustrating if the control's wheren't so tight.<p>As an aside i think a good setup for this type of game would be using an xbox360/ps3 controller, the directional pad to control mario, shoulder button L1 to jump and L2 to run/shoot fireballs, the right analog stick to control the portal gun and shoulder buttons R1/R2 to shoot the portal gun",1330977372

You'll notice it's pretty inefficient.<p>> Nobody is searching the entire dom for matching nodes.<p>I should start counting the number of times I encounter `$("".stupid"")` reading source code. The count would probably be in the thousands.<p>> What does that even mean in this context?? How does it further your point?<p>Using ""CSS selectors"" to traverse a tree of nodes is utterly stupid.

3667994,comment,3667052,3667052,5,0,robomartin,,,"Maybe it is becoming clear that the age of the generalist government is over.  In science and industry the age of the generalist ended a long time ago. While it was, at one time, possible for someone to know almost literally all that there was to be known, that didn't last too long.  Specialization in various fields led to significant improvements and progress within those fields.<p>Could it be that a new form of government needs to emerge in this model?  One where policy on a specific subject area is handled by those better equipped to understand it and, more importantly, with a good degree of isolation from others?<p>Wouldn't it be better if, say, education policy was crafted in total isolation from the political goals of any party, special interest group or unions?  Or how about energy policy?<p>I firmly believe the basic premise of the article to be true:  Most voters don't understand what the hell they are voting on.  They are easily swayed by a barrage of numbers and pretend-facts and probably vote on what sounds good or believable far more so than what might have merit based on facts.<p>Take the arguments on manufacturing, for example.  Everyone from the President on down to Congress and GOP candidates are talking about bringing manufacturing back.  Both parties at all level do it.  Now, there are two possibilities here:  One, they know the truth and realize that the masses might not be able to handle the truth. Or, they actually don't understand what's going on.<p>Manufacturing, folks, isn't coming back to the US or Europe in massive numbers any time soon, if ever.  The standard of living of the average manufacturing worker would have to be reduced to revolution-inspiring levels for this to happen.  Environmental and worker safety laws would have to trashed by the thousands.  Virtually all labor unions would have to be dissolved.  And more.  The loss of manufacturing jobs has taken place over sixty years of making the wrong decisions.  This did not happen overnight.  And this cannot be fixed overnight, if ever.  Just try to manufacture a consumer good in the US and see how far you get.  Sure, there are outliers that might buck the trend, but, for the most part, its a done deal:  Mass manufacturing of consumer goods in the US is dead.<p>Anyhow, I believe that voters do tend to vote people into office for entirely the wrong reasons.  From religious groups to unions and special interest sectors.  All seek to place puppets in office that will protect and further their interests.  Virtually none --due to the nature of their egocentric focus-- act with the long term interest of the country in mind.<p>Not an easy problem to solve as it would require a nearly complete change in the form of government we have known for so long.  The problem is that the US Constitution does not provide for a mechanism through which these kinds of changes could be made.  The only way is for a massive and very disruptive revolution to take place.  This is unlikely to happen unless things get so bad that people are compelled to ""take up arms against their oppressor"".  And, this is highly undesirable as well because it would probably result in half a century of uncertainty and turmoil before reaching a new stable state.<p>And this takes us full circle to an inevitable conclusion:  As much as we might hate the fact that the lunatics are running the asylum, it is probably the best option we have.  The job, then, is to try to be as creative as possible in bringing issues to the masses in order to make it easy to understand what can sometimes be very complex.<p>The day we elect politicians that, for example, laugh at the idea of rejecting something like the theory of evolution will be the day that we'll know that we are on the right path.  That's because you'll have people in office that will be smart enough to consider evidence rather than indoctrinated ideological drones.<p>This is a big topic.",1330976366

Since in such a market you can't <i>force</i> anyone to buy your product--they only will if it's worth more to them than what they pay--you can only stay in business by providing mutual gain.

So, the thing is, I just received a job offer from a large tech company and I'd like to accept.  They will ask me to sign a non-compete (it's legal where they are).  But the problem is that, unlike my previous company, this company is in many different lines of business, including games.  So there is overlap there.  I have been reading up on non-competes and it looks like they are non-enforcable unless the company can demonstrate that confidential information/trade secrets was actually stolen and used to help the competitor in question.\nSo the thing is, most of the code for this project is already written.  But if the game became popular and they came after me, how would I prove that?  It's not open source so I can't point to a github commit history or anything like that.  Do courts look at modification dates/times on files?    I realize this probably paranoid, I doubt this company is going to come after me for my hobby iphone app or whatever.

There are various types of ""majority"", and all of them fail at fully representing ""the people"" as a whole, unless it's a 100% majority where nobody abstains (and even then, one would have to argue about who was allowed to vote and how).<p>This is why any robust democratic system will have, on some subjects, ""qualified"" majorities (where the threshold is set much higher than 51%, or abstained votes are counted against, etc etc) or ""relative"" majorities (where the most popular option wins, even when it doesn't represent at least 50% of the votes) as well as the ""simple"" majority (usually 50% + 1 or 51% of the expressed votes). They're different ways of really interpreting ""the will of the people"" on different subjects. A proper democratic system recognises the importance of respecting minorities and the volatility (and gullibility) of popular sentiment, and safeguards itself against wrong decisions. Many fascist governments were democratically elected and survived re-election, but they were not democratic in nature.<p>If the majority of synapses in your brain should decide tomorrow that shooting yourself in the foot is a good idea, despite ""a small but vocal minority opposed to the plan"" (i.e. your foot), that doesn't mean that it'd be in your real interest to do so.",1330974558

That's a pretty sweet gig.<p>Also, one thing that I think is missing here is that the human capacity for high-caliber ""knowledge work"" is far from infinite. Most of the best folks I've met can only cram maybe a handful of hours of legitimately productive knowledge work into a single day. A good way to buffer those few hours of work is to spend additional hours doing low-stress busy work. Like data entry. If you change that to attempting to cram more stressful work topped off with new employee management tasks into that time period then in the worst case scenario you could tip the scales into driving someone to burn-out.<p>Edit: The point I'm trying to get at is that the idea of a simple tradeoff between spending time on a ""trivial"" activity competing with time spent on a more meaningful activity is extraordinarily naive. Just because you free up time by avoiding one activity doesn't mean it's possible to fill in all that time with another activity, since sometimes there are limits. Also, sometimes seemingly trivial activities serve important roles. If one didn't know any better it would be easy to look at an average person's schedule and desire to reallocate all of the time spent on sleep and eating to productive work. However, for those cases we know better. But for other more complex cases we don't know better.<p>If we had an objective model for optimally scheduling the time of someone who makes more than a dollar a second, then a lot more people would be making that much money.<p>But we don't. It's not objective, it's subjective. And trying to force a one in a million creative knowledge worker into a 19th century factory worker mindset seems like the surest way to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.",1330974537

That in some case, they had issues when they first changed to an annual oil change maintenance spec using conventional oil. Then, perhaps on different engines, they had issues when advising a 12k or 15k interval (can't remember which) on synthetic.<p>Seems they learned from the mistakes around 2006-7 and from that point forward their maintenance spec is strictly syn (mobile 1) on a 10k, 1yr change interval.<p>I had oil analysis done on my last change, a 5.5l v8, which I ran for about 11k miles, and the results were very good. The oil probably had another few thousand miles life in it. Not that I'd push it, it was just good to know I didn't have sludge after 11k miles.",1330974387

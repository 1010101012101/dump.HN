Because after a fair bit of product development experience (mostly agile, mostly outside of the startup world) many things about CD resonated strongly with me. For one quick example, the bits about listening to your customers but not necessarily doing what they say are handled with more insight and nuance than most methodologies.  This (and Blank's resume) gave the process enough credibility to me for me to attempt to follow it.<p>I don't feel I'm far enough through the process to answer ""the most useful aspect"" part yet, although I think most of the core process that I've tried has been useful.  CD is actually a pretty small process: It doesn't really that many steps, it just takes time and discipline to execute them.<p>The hardest parts for me so far have been<p>(a) getting really crisp on the problem/solution hypothesis<p>(b) approximating customer visits in a B2C environment",1274533102

The minutes never expire as long as you buy minutes at least once a year, which will cost you as little as $5. I spend around $100 on my phone service per year, total.<p>Unfortunately AFAIK, you just plain can't get data plans with prepaid, from anyone. So prepaid doesn't work very well with smartphones.

1370231,comment,1369757,1370091,0,0,halo,,,"I have wondered this before too. I can think of a few reasons why this might be the case:<p>* US phone operators charging for incoming calls and messages, which make prepay phones much less useful.<p>* Standardisation on GSM in most of the rest of the world, which reduced control by the networks, created a market for unlocked phones, and increased competition by making it easier to change networks and phones.<p>* Cultural differences that mean that more people end up on contract phones. For example, teenagers often end up on 'Family Plan' contracts rather than Pay-As-You-Go, at least partially influenced by the above two factors. This helps creates a cycle where people consider contracts 'the norm'.",1274532318

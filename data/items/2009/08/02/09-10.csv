737267,comment,737260,737260,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The reason why C is so big in the embedded/realtime world is because there are no 'layers' underneath you that can screw up the timing. Deterministic behaviour is one of the key goals in that sphere. (and it should be in every other but that's not economically feasible it seems).<p>On the web, where programmer time is expensive and most software is throw-away (sorry, but that's the way I see it even if that is not a popular attitude here) the equation is completely different and skewed towards scripting languages, with 'java' (basically a safer version of C++) taking up a good portion of the compiled segment.<p>Hardly anybody directly programs their web aware stuff in C.<p>Most entry level jobs are with companies that do web development, there you learn how to do scripting and quick and dirty development, usually with lots of loose ends in the final product.<p>When you program in C such undisciplined coding would be punished with lots of segmentation faults and data corruption issues, and before long you'd be a more seasoned - and more careful - programmer.<p>Even seasoned and careful programmers mess up though, witness the endless stream of buffer overflow exploits.<p>Another great thing about C is that it is not such a moving target, once you've learned it you're 'current' for the next decade or two or so.<p>The proliferation of languages and environments is quite bewildering at times. This years hottest technology is next years garbage. In the C world things move at a more relaxed pace and the technology you're interfacing with is generally speaking more mature, it doesn't feel so much like a work in progress.",1249206899

There are probably scenarios in which paralyzing an airport for a while could be pretty dangerous.<p>However, what makes you think you're right? It sounds like it would take quite a bit of system re-engineering to stop the DoS and return to normal service: the ATC system has to figure out which flight plans are real and which ones are spurious, and be sure to print out all the real ones.",1249205897

It builds on work done during the 1980s by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, based on a concept called Linus.""<p>On a more serious note, I wonder how they will deal with metal fatigue on the sphere being rammed by the pistons once every second. Not all of the energy of those compressions will be transferred into the fluid, that sounds like the reactor core might become a wear item.<p>Another question regarding this:<p>""likely because the technology to precisely control the speed and simultaneous triggering of the compressed-air pistons simply didn't exist two decades ago.""<p>What is so critical about controlling compressed air pistons ? They move at a snails pace relative to electronics from the 70's, why is it that only now this would be possible based on controlling essentially very slow devices once-per-second ?<p>And wouldn't it be easier to do this using electromagnets attached to the outer shell at strategic spots ? <i>much</i> faster response time and higher frequencies possible, also much easier to synchronize than 220 pneumatic hammers striking a sphere.

737253,comment,737192,737192,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"After reading the long version of your question I want to say that my own experience with generic application generators is very similar to yours. Users want functionality and wording that is very specific to particular tasks.<p>Therefore any generic framework can only ever serve as a basis for you to create specific applications. The question remains whether a generic framework or generator actually makes that task any easier. I doubt it. I tend to end up building one generic framework per application :-)<p>So what could you do? One thing you should include in your thinking is that CRUD/OLTP + simple reporting is not the only thing people do, and it's probably the most crowded market.<p>The other thing people do is analyse data. In order to analyse data they have to integrate and clean it first. It's a horribly messy affair, but what it involves is a generic database and user friendly transformation rules.<p>I know I'm not being very specific, but I think it could useful for you to think a little more about decision support, analytics and data integration. It's what I do as well, so I'm biased.",1249205158

The read problem is that you ""don't know how to solve overweight issues"".<p>I got a solution, but I'm not sure if you'll go for it.<p>Decompose your website into parts, I don't know how it can be. But for me it was a windows application built with the Dot net frame work. I decomposed it into several namespaces and classes and placed those classes in ""DLL"" files.<p>Now the program is much more tinier. I don't care about the DLL files, I just call them to get something ready. Like calling a class, giving information about a barcode and getting back a picture. In reality it's more than 400 line of code to do that. but with OOP and DLL, in few lines I can do it.<p>Now you have to explore the possibilities of your programming platform.",1249205050

And the GPL stuff is almost always free economically too.  In practice if you give people complete freedom over sources you really have to give them the same freedom you have to change and distribute.  So by undercutting price tends aymptotically to zero.

737247,comment,737102,737234,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The reason why fortran is used for simulations is twofold, first there is a large and very well tested set of software tools written in fortran for exactly that purpose, these codebases have been through hell and back with respect to having their output inspected. They are very close to being bug free. A re-write of such a package would cost considerable time and would probably not yield better results, and rewriting them in an interpreted language would yield those results considerably slower. Programming staff time is expensive, so is computer time.<p>Second, the hardware that these simulations run on ('supercomputers') is optimized for vector processing, which is an expensive way of saying that you are operating on whole arrays of data at a time.<p>Typical operations are multiplying two vectors of data with each other, multiply-and-sum operations and so on. Because simulations of real world scenarios almost always contain large amounts of these operations 'supercomputers' are one way to get good performance, and most numerical libraries in fortran are available for them, and sometimes even optimized for that particular hardware.<p>But even on commodity hardware (clusters of pc's) the general availability of tested code is the cause of inertia in the scientific world, these people are trying to solve a problem, they're not 'in love' with any language, the tool that suits them best (libraries available, co-workers versed in it, citations all over the place) is what they'll use.<p>If you want to get very high performance numerical work done on a pc I'd advise you to look into CUDA. Fortran bindings for CUDA exist so you can use all those libraries at absolutely amazing speeds for very little money.",1249204691

737239,comment,736506,736598,0,0,tel,,,"I spent a lot of time talking with people in the Haidian District in Beijing. This area is contains the two most prominent (and many, many lesser) universities in China so it's interesting to see the general opinion of people around there.<p>The unfortunate part is that it's a whole lot of apathy. I'm sure it's not easy, even for a foreigner, to find the heart of some people willing to speak or move against the Chinese government, but so many who I ran in to were casually trying to remain in their own world disjoint from  the government. They feel a little rebellious just to support the stores that sell ironic Mao Zeodong merchandise and love to mildly mention that the government is really not that great here. That's about the depth of what I actively observed.<p>I'll disclaim that I didnt' spend much time talking to those in what would have been the most charged fields (politics or philosophy, perhaps), but the general apathy was sort of disheartening.<p>It's not all negative though. The educated Chinese are largely embracing the internet and desire to involve themselves more. For many, they give you a surprised look when you ask them about bypassing the firewall: <i>you mean you don't have access to a proxy? Really? I thought everyone did</i>. If this is the face of the new Tank Man, it's definitely going to be a different ride, but the transformative power of an enormous information pipeline plugged into the future leaders of your country still seems pretty portent.<p>And ethnic strife would need to be the topic of a whole essay.

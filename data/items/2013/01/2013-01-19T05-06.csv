It's just not commonly done because the end result of a C/C++ compiler is ""fast enough"".  
Plus, JIT's have a weird set of tradeoffs.  You'd really need a hybrid model where you did expensive high level loop transformations statically, then left the IR alone and JIT'd it[1].  This whole set of ideas quickly gets into TeNDRA/ANDF territory, however.<p>[1] Of course, profiling at runtime through the JIT may discover some more places to loop transform.",1358574709

The only (highly dubious) claim we can make why Orkut did not succeed right away its because it was treated as side-project by Google, rather then throwing 100s of people on it right away to develop it better, and to compensate for early mistakes like Brazil stealing early audience and pushing local users away from the community.<p>Yet thats kinda the key point of the essay: the act of knowing how big/important social networking is requires somebody first to formalize that knowledge. imho Google was very good corporate host to let Orkut experiment so much as he did.

5082750,comment,5080210,5082377,2,0,DannyBee,,,"It's not actually the structure of C programs, it's the guarantees the language offers.  So only about the first paragraph of your rant is right.<p>Fortran had almost no memory aliasing, explicit global accesses, and offered almost unbridled implementor freedom.
As long as the operations got done, it didn't care what happened behind the scenes.<p>None of the rest of the things you talk about matter when it comes to optimizing C, to be honest.  If you gave me no aliasing by default and explicit globals, I probably could do near as well as fortran (though it would take significantly more analysis) in terms of loop transformations.<p>Note that ""full alias analysis"" is statically undecidable.  When you say cubic order, you are thinking of Andersen's subtyping based algorithm. There are unification based algorithms that are almost linear time (inverse ackermann).<p>At this point, we have scaled these algorithms almost as far as you can on a single computer.  You can do context insensitive andersens on many million LOC without too much trouble.<p>Context-insensitive unification points-to can scale to whatever size you like.<p>Context sensitive unification based algorithms do quite well in practice with 10 million LOC + codebases.<p>The main reason you don't see unification based algorithms used often in free compilers is because the entire set of algorithms are covered by patents owned by MS Research.<p>As a final note, note that C++ does not really help optimization in practice, it often hurts it.<p>It is very hard to teach a pointer analysis algorithm about virtual calling. Most compilers treat them like function pointers that get type-filtered, and do some form of class hierarchy analysis to limit the number of call graph targets, or try to incrementally discover the call graph.  It's a bit of a mess.<p>On the other hand, straight function pointers get resolved either context-sensitively or insensitively.<p>In fact, C++ makes type based aliasing a <i>lot</i> worse due to placement new being able to legally change the type of a piece of memory, which is very hard to track over a program.<p>Even outside the realm of alias analysis, C++ involves a lot more structures, which means a lot more time has to be spent trying to get pieces back into scalars, or struct splitting, or something, so that you don't end up having to fuck around with memory every time you touch a piece of the structure.<p>I could go on and on.<p>In short: Any of C++'s lower level optimization advantages come from less pointer usage by programmers, not language guarantees.<p>At the high level, it's from better standard implementations and common usage idioms.<p>In any case, high level languages, particularly those with memory objects (not real pointers, just memory objects, like Java) usually solve none of the pointer/alias analysis related problems. You are still stuck with the same pointer analysis algorithms.<p>For example: The only nice thing about java's memory system is that doing structure-field sensitive pointer analysis can only help, whereas in C it can hurt, due to some weirdness.<p>It's just nobody usually gets around to doing pointer analysis on the higher level languages (because it's harder and offers no particular benefit), they lower their language to an IR that already has a good algorithm in it.<p>Just in case you were wondering, i'm not talking out of my ass. I wrote GCC's first set of high level loop optimizations, and also, it's pointer analysis.",1358574384

As if to imply that Boeing doesn't have capable people coming from someone who  while certainly has had his achievements doesn't have that long of a history. 787 was a huge ""bet the company"" type undertaking. It's a black eye but they will fix it. Nobody can accuse Boeing as a company of just being lucky either with their history.",1358571946

Since a bunch of NASA guys have gone to SpaceX and since Toyota and Daimler both work with Tesla (both are multi-billion dollar companies), I think the zip-code/ballpark analogy went too far. The company is younger and smaller, granted, but I wouldn't put it past them to put a serious dent in Boeing's businesses.<p>And, about the criteria being narrow: yes, of course it is.",1358571805

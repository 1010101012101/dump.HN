From search apps to office suite to hosting, they have it all.<p>The toothpaste example doesn't apply to software. Because a new toothpaste may claim that it does X or Y or Z as we see in the ads. We ofcourse don't have time to test it. So most only 'believe' it. Incase of software, example: if someone claims to be better than Google, you can easily notice the difference. I once read on TC about megavideo and watched a video on Megavideo and found that its faster than youtube. That's not yet made a habit, since there's no community there like on youtube.<p>Toothpaste and Google still have something in common - if I find it good, I'll surely tell my friends.",1216029343

I'd suspect most developers with niche products have niche usability needs that make it lesson relevant. If you're building a giant web portal, it seems relatively inexpensive for access to decent comparative stats.",1216027342

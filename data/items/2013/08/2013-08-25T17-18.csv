I don&#x27;t think you can really judge them against other periods until you&#x27;ve got a century or so of hindsight. So I&#x27;m afraid that your assertion that they&#x27;re not like they used to be sounds like it&#x27;s prejudiced by your belief that people are getting stupider. I bet in a hundred years, there will be classics from our time as much as any other.<p>Science is an interesting one. Perhaps we have already made most of the big leaps in understanding the natural world. But that doesn&#x27;t imply that scientists now are less intelligent than scientists &#x27;back then&#x27;. I&#x27;d argue that it takes more knowledge and work to make even seemingly &#x27;minor&#x27; discoveries.

* older than 30 yrs old or had kids.<p>I have kids now. That is one of the major reasons I do not like SF anymore (mid 30s) but I did a decade ago.

If this happens to you, SF/SV is going to be an awful place to be, IMO.<p>Related to this article specifically, I have no doubt this is absolutely true. I&#x27;ve had interviews for jobs and while they don&#x27;t ask questions about family or what not, they ask about &quot;commitment&quot; and &quot;hours&quot;. Questions like &quot;can you commit 100% to this job?&quot; or &quot;can you work 6 days a week or put in the hours necessary to do this job?&quot;. Those are questions asked to suss out if someone is going to basically live the job and push everything else away. They might ask that of everyone, but when asked to someone in their mid to late 30s it smacks of &quot;hey, are you going to neglect your family for this job?&quot;.",1377453383

Then, &quot;The app needs to look up the stock price of symbol ___&quot;
Then, &quot;If the tweet contains the word &quot;awesome&quot; and the stock price is over $X, sell the stock&quot;
etc.<p>Here&#x27;s where you have to make a decision.  Either learn to code each the bare minimum aspect, or find someone who can do it for you.<p>Having worked out exactly what you want your app to do, how many individual steps it will take to do it, and how the app should react in certain situations will make it a lot easier when you come to code it or hire someone to help.<p>So, refine your idea, then work on building it.",1377452965

Best case scenario is that the code is clear, easy to update the UI, and the only reason it hasn&#x27;t been done is because no one cares about the UI. That seems incredibly unlikely (the caring part - someone built it, maintains it, and will probably be upset if you &quot;fix&quot; it).<p>On other projects, you first get a huge range of code complexity/quality, making contributing perhaps simply not feasible. After that, you can run into all sorts of stuff. My real world experience:<p><pre><code>  &quot;We won&#x27;t take this because we use linked lists, not hashtables, because <original maintainer> likes linked lists.&quot; 
  &quot;We won&#x27;t fix this broken XML parser because this code is fast.&quot;

It gets worse as a programmer builds up more experience to back up his case. Case in point: you ever talk to an older Lisp guy? The ones who will rip into you just for using Clojure?<p>In a nutshell, I think that we do it to ourselves, and it is just a matter of time, before the current crop of &quot;young&quot; people turn into &quot;old&quot; people.

But mp3 players were definitely something people knew about before iPod&#x27;s (at least the kids, can&#x27;t speak for the adults at the time). Some even got those mp3 players with 128 MB, enough to cram two albums into. I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth it before 512 MB, at the least.<p>Back when I was in the market for a good (gigabits of storage) mp3 player, I don&#x27;t recall that iPod was the definite go-to choice in the electronics store.<p>> And you dismiss a feature of the iPods by just saying &#x27;a great user interface&#x27;.<p>Not <i>dismiss</i> in general as much as dismiss when it comes to revolutionizing music listening and the industry. I think that people would still have adapted mp3 players (what were the alternatives? Discmans and those cassette-like players which you could record 320 minutes of music max on each disc?) even if Apple wouldn&#x27;t have come out with a really nice UI.<p>> Plus, and I cannot stress this enough, iTunes really was power pushing the iPod and Apple along. First, by truly binding hardware and software together to work together as seamlessly as possible.<p>All mp3 players I&#x27;ve used (except for iPod&#x27;s) are very easy to manage: plug it to the computer, open the folder of the mp3 player, and copy-paste songs. I am hardly a &#x27;techie&#x27; when it comes to general computer usage, and I was not back then, either. But maybe this was beyond the capabilities of most people for all I know.<p>> Second, by being able to purchase songs from iTunes store, and have it automatically appear in iTunes.<p>I could torrent music and have them automatically appear in my Downloads folder. You could say that the iTunes way is more user-friendly, but most people used Windows back then and were used to shuffling around files and folders themselves, because you <i>had</i> to do that at some if you wanted to do more than read your mail.<p>> And thirdly, and this is perhaps the most important bit, by forcing (and by forcing, I mean sometimes using the mob style of forcing) the record industry to play along. No longer did you have to know which artist belonged to which record company in order to buy music. No longer having to browse 4 or 5 different sites to find music.<p>I guess I never was big on buying music online. I downloaded illicitlyt, bought some things in the store and the few things I didn&#x27;t find I bought through iTunes. I know the last part validates your point, but having four more albums in my collection didn&#x27;t exactly revolutionize my music listening.<p>> No longer did you have to convert songs, if you could even, to another to get around DRM to get all your music to play on one device.<p>When I changed computers I couldn&#x27;t get my songs to play on the new machine.<p>> So, yes, they did revolutionize the music industry.<p>What revolutionized music listening for me was: 1. being able to easily download (mostly pirate) music 2. streaming services (only used Spotify myself).",1377452591

Start with a language that makes it easy to do what you need for the most complicated part of your app. What is that part? Do you use a research-grade algorithm that is only implemented in one particular language? Use that language. Do you use run-of-the-mill machine learning? Consider Python, or any language you like and just farm out the hard part to R. Do you just need to express complex algorithms without re-deriving them? Then really any language should do.<p>(2) Find a co-founder. This is tough because without any programming background, how do you evaluate whether someone would be a sufficiently technical co-founder for you? I&#x27;d say that this implies some aspect of #1 in that you&#x27;d need to get a bit more comfortable with programming.<p>(3) Outsource. This requires more money, less time. One might imagine that someone who does a lot of stock trading should actually have more money and less time than most, but I don&#x27;t know you and it doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway. You could outsource your technology. You&#x27;d just need to tightly control the schedule and the key elements of the product (e.g., make sure that they&#x27;ve correctly implemented your desired algorithms).",1377452357

It&#x27;s just a simple crypto API. You give Windows some data, it encrypts it with a (user/machine/process) specific key and returns it. It&#x27;s up to Chrome to store it. So, any bad software would already need to target Chrome&#x27;s settings files, so hard-coded (or install generated) entropy adds nothing.<p>There is the Windows Credential storage which is system wide (I think IE uses that), but Chrome does not, to my knowledge. (I&#x27;ve got a hundred entries in Chrome, and only a few certs and passwords in credstore.)<p>> would mind typing in a password<p>This is an entirely different suggestion and that sounds like a decent feature but not really. If you want a password manager like PasswordSafe that stores passwords &quot;safely&quot; (and does auto-relock, moves around in RAM to avoid any &quot;ghosting&quot; effects, etc.) then use a dedicated program. Adding it to Chrome adds complexity for little additional security (if your workstation is unlocked, it&#x27;s almost definitely game over).<p>And the original article is talking about non-technical friendly culture of leaving stuff around unlocked. Even with a master password, Chrome is left open all the time anyways. So it&#x27;s a doubly dubious feature. You&#x27;d need to add auto-relocking, etc. etc.<p>If Chrome does all this, one of the Chrome members should implement a lightweight, benign exe that undoes it all in one quick move, shows you passwords, then deletes itself. So you can just hit like new incognito window, <a href=""https://url.thing/chromepass"" rel=""nofollow"">https://url.thing/chromepass</a> and immediately undo it all, just to remind people how silly it is.<p>Edit: Remember that most security threats are remote, and Chrome has been doing a fantastic job on the actual security model. Cert pinning, for instance, prevents vastly more attacks than this complicated password thing would do. Wikipedia says Chrome (and new Safari) are the only current browsers to support TLS > 1.0 (needed to prevent some attacks).<p>I&#x27;m glad the Chrome team is moving with a real threat model, rather than hand-wavy stuff.",1377451962

It was a very high-friction time consuming process.<p>Now you can subscribe to NFL.com and get videos of every NFL game and the coaches film, and the radio calls, immediately after they air with big play markers already tagged. So if I wanted to make a highlight video or a database of every big play from the season, it&#x27;s a pretty painless process.<p>Because it&#x27;s getting easier for motivated fans to produce content such as highlight videos, or analysis on sports, I think we&#x27;re really going to see an erosion of sports reporting on networks like ESPN, as slowly their only purpose becomes live broadcasts. We&#x27;re going to start sourcing our sports content from podcasts that we like, or a youtube channel that produces good content as opposed to &quot;whatever garbage espn has on at the current time&quot;.

I know a lot of kids who did &quot;math camp&quot; who also credit that as giving them an impulse to learn more.<p>But I think the same problem that elite colleges face also exists here: If your school&#x27;s graduates are the cream of the crop of your society / field, is it because your education caused them to be or is it because you selected the cream of the crop to begin with?<p>So, I&#x27;d like to hijack this thread to focus your attention on another tangentially related problem: Teaching people who don&#x27;t self-identify as &quot;math kids&quot;. I think these are the low hanging fruit that, if improved, would improve society as a whole.<p>What I often see with people who say &quot;I can&#x27;t do math&quot; is a shaky understanding of true basics. Kids will cross-multiply an equation to simplify it but they won&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re doing it or why it works. Then, they&#x27;ll pass tests because they can do the basic algorithm. Now they think they know it and their teachers think they know it, and they move on to a different subject. Conceptually, the new stuff piles on top of the old stuff and so they have no hope of understanding what is going on, OR they further the &quot;see question type x, apply algorithm y&quot; mentality until it collapses.<p>So, I&#x27;d love to see a &quot;learn math the hard way&quot; where people can iteratively learn the fundamentals of arithmetic, algebra, and basic proofs. What I love about that series is that it&#x27;s iterative to a fault. Every section is tens of experiments with a very simple concept. What if I use it this way? What if I stick in a string? What if I spell it wrong?<p>It teaches concepts at a slow enough pace that anyone can catch a conceptual leap that&#x27;d otherwise be undecipherable and confusing to beginners. It teaches that experimental mindset. It can get boring if you already know that part, but you can skip it if you like.<p>The part that I don&#x27;t know what to do about is when you fast forward 10 years and you try to correct faulty education, and people balk at you for teaching them &quot;easy stuff they already know&quot; and not the more complicated topic that they&#x27;re currently concerned with.",1377450805

And then you can buy packs of designs for $5, or make and sell your own. It will totally change the fashion industry. You can have a wardrobe of one shirt, one pair of shorts, a pair of pants, a v-neck for when you&#x27;re feeling different, etc.<p>The whole clothing item would be a screen basically, instead of only a small area. That way you could literally design every small facet.",1377450700

Despite a relatively simple building layout, I notice that my mind doesn&#x27;t &quot;map&quot; out the scene like it would if I was actually walking through the building.<p>This causes a huge break in immersion, where I&#x27;ve been walking around a town/building in a game for 30 minutes and have no idea where I am or how I really got there.<p>I think that VR is going to be the nail in the coffin for this problem. Awhile ago I tried a VR demo on one of those omni-directional platforms where you literally walk in the direction you want to go, and I noticed that my mind was internally mapping out the scene. As a result, the simulation was -much- more immersive, and I was quite content with just walking around the game world that was set up.<p>If this tech becomes widespread, I can see it opening up video game niches that have previously been untouched. Simulators for stuff ranging from exploring complex ruins to talking a walk in a forest, to showing home buyers what houses are like without having to drive out to them.",1377450699

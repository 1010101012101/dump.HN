6140,comment,6134,6134,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Great speech. My only comment is on the idea that we will look back on professionals as being like serfs. As Paul mentioned earlier, what is driving people into the service of others is a combination of social status, risk avoidance, and the need for ""structure.""<p>I don't think risk avoidance and need for structure will ever change. The real question is whether our conceptions of social status will change. So I've been writing a lot recently about how organizations and institutions exploit people's need for social status in order to secure cheap labor and make money. <p>The most obvious example is how WoW literally allows you to ""level up."" Even though objectively you are just spending 12 hours a day clicking on pictures of digital rats on a computer screen, qualitatively it's designed to make you feel like a hero. Everyone wants to be a hero in real life, but most people are just too lazy or untalented or risk adverse. It's not fair, but that's the way it is. Organizations have figured out how to tap into people's need to ""be the hero"" while extracting cheap labor (or purchases) from them. <p>A good example is when I was learning to play the trumpet. Learning to play a musical instrument is a very slow and continuous process. If my trumpet teacher were to have said, ""ok, today you are level one trumpet. ok, now you're level two trumpet. etc."" I think most people could figure out it's a scam. Improving at trumpet is a continuous function, not something that happens in levels.<p>The thing is, when people say, ""ok, you're level one at education, you're level three at business."" then no one realizes they are being exploited. In general, reality is very continuous. Whenever someone tries to represent a phenomena as something you can ""level up"" in, chances are they are trying to fuck you, take your money, or both. <p>Until people realize this is happening, professionalism will never go away. Instead people are obsessed with ""climbing the ladder."" Thing is, climbing the ladder benefits the people at the top, not the bottom. The average person doesn't even realize this.<p>I think in order for this mentality to end, two things are needed:<p>1) People currently view social status as a function of what people with money and power think of you. People need to instead view social status a function of your ability to MSPW.<p>2) We need new forms of social signaling that take this into account. Currently people identify themselves through college credentials, brand name clothes, etc. I think social signaling DOES have an important economic role to play, however, we need new forms of social signaling based around MSPW.

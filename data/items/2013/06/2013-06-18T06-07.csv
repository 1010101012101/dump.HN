This can only be done by understanding who the person is and/or marketing relevant products. PR & media should take advantage of the nascent nature of this industry and focus squarely on this through bundles, their own curated content, etc. and legitimize mobile despite the small screen and price. App Gratis is an innovative (?) example of this but I&#x27;m sure there are many more to be created. If done properly, Apple will begin to realize that the overall market can be maximized by easing their restraints.",1371538777

Permadeath and single saves makes games like Nethack and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup nail-biting experiences that keep you striving to improve, even though these turn-based games give you all the time in the world to plan your next move.<p>Granted, the audience for this kind of game is self-limiting, and the games themselves are designed around replayability. But you see new games such as Demon&#x27;s Souls/Dark Souls use similar negative-reinforcement techniques to create truly engaging experiences that some people find fun and addicting.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve lost a Nethack character in the Astral Planes, losing hundreds of thousands of turns and sometimes weeks of effort just before the end. But each time I died, I learned how to counter yet another combination of states that resulted in my death, and Nethack finally became boring when I could ascend in a few hours. This point took me 16 years to reach. Very, very few modern games can reach that level of engagement.",1371538563

For example, one of our iPad apps was #1 in the Finance category for six weeks. The media first mentioned this app several days after it became #1. Apple also featured the app a few days after the app became #1 (the app was never priced at the lowest price tiers). The app got initial traction organically and the #1 ranking helped it get even more traction.<p>It isn&#x27;t realistic to expect Apple to be able to pick a list of &quot;great apps&quot;. Following up on my example, we launched a new version of the iPad app a couple of weeks ago, but Apple isn&#x27;t featuring it on the &quot;new and noteworthy&quot; list even though the app has hundreds of reviews with 2/3 of them being 5-star reviews and another 1/4 being 4-star reviews<p>Relying solely on Apple&#x27;s featured list and on media-connections or advertisements may work for one class of developers, but for many other developers, the (category-specific) top-lists are helpful.

The auto companies were startups and couldn&#x27;t afford the cap ex of retail operations.  So after the industry matured the manufacturers became huge they were a threat to the dealers that helped them succeed.  However, Tesla doesn&#x27;t have any legacy relationships with dealers. Public opinion is on Tesla&#x27;s side.  The dealership&#x27;s days are numbered.  Ordering online allows custom cars, and reduces inventory and storage costs for manufacturers.<p>See my blog post on Tesla

With this in mind, do you think it is acceptable that those in the NSA, many of whom may have a differing political affiliation than you, can read any correspondence flagged for review? Furthermore, how can any member of congress operate from a position of equality if they cannot have confidence that their communications could fall into the hands of their compatriots across the aisle that may have a different agenda?&quot;<p>If the answer to those questions included a filter that excluded all members of the executive, legislative and judicial, the obvious follow up question would be, &quot;Why are members of congress allowed this right, but not the citizens of this country?&quot;<p>I would also take comments he made on the Wikileaks Manning trove and present them as counterpoints to any rebuttal he has.

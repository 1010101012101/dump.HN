241817,comment,241702,241702,0,0,Anon84,,,"As my data structures professor would say: ""Bipartite matching is a hard problem, specially when it involves women!""<p>Seriously, though...<p>IMHO the most successful dating site would probably start off as a Linked In like social network, where you could have matches based on the people you know. Matching algorithms of any sort (like Match.com Chemistry.com eHarmony.com, etc use) could be used to improve the matches, but I think that having a ""recommendation"" from people you already trust would be a very big plus. This is probably why pre-existing social newtworks like Facebook, MySpace, Hi5, et al usually end up being used for such purposes.",1215647892

241813,comment,241702,241702,0,0,jamongkad,,,"Hmmm to be honest nothing screams ""Plan B"" more than a dating site. Honestly I have never used the service because most of the women I date are from referrals from friends and family. So there's that element of trust right there. Made me feel safer! Maybe if you could build dating site that applies that element of trust. Maybe you could have the said ""dater"" try to earn some sort of ""trust"" points. Make it so that the more trust points they have. The better partner they are. This is just off the top of my head though and it worth experimenting.",1215647027

If anything their PR department should be reaching out to him and letting him try out their new products.

The only restriction is that one can't deny others the same freedoms. You're also free not to use it.<p>I find it interesting that so many criticize RMS for his character and style. I find myself very tolerant of people who are very talented programmers. I think RMS is a pretty decent programmer. Emacs, GCC, ... have added a lot of value over the years.",1215645999

Seriously though, I bet he's at the library checking it out right now. :)<p>But while we're recommending books he doesn't want, I would like to suggest W.P. Montague's, The Ways of Knowing.<p>Particularly, it's explanation of authoritarianism, when it's appropriate and when it's not, has been indispensable.<p>To whet your appetite, I'll say this much:<p>Montague asserts that if you want to fill your head with true beliefs (this stuff called knowledge) about reality, then you should be aware of five distinct types of evidence that a human can collect and five distinct logical theories with which to process (Rationalism, Empiricism, Authoritarianism, Pragmatism, Mysticism). The more mastery, the more knowledge.<p>The book is slow going but not for the usual reasons. Each page made me want to pause and sit and think until I had totally reprocessed all my life's experiences and questioned all my now seemingly ill-formed conclusions in the new light of my increased powers of reasoning.<p>If I found a genie in a lamp and he granted me one wish, I would wish that everyone in the world would read the first chapter of that book... or for a puppy.<p>You can get a nice ~1930's copy for like $6 at an antique book store.",1215645839

241792,comment,241702,241702,0,0,neilk,,,"There's nothing wrong with the dating services. The people are broken.<p>People lie. Solve that one and you may have something. (True.com tried to do this.)<p>Also, most dating sites act as a sort of amplification for the user's dating filters and skill at attracting interest. However, I believe that most people are lonely because their dating filters are broken, and because they have trouble attracting interest. Dating sites only help these people 
fail faster and at greater scale.<p>(Exception: tall women. They are not necessarily damaged, they really do have a sort of search problem that is more solveable at scale.)<p>I have started to think that a really successful dating site would start from the premise that the user is broken and cannot be relied on to find or choose a partner. Maybe use social networks so that their friends help them find someone? Or even anonymous strangers, for karma points? Straight women do this sort of thing anyway (straight guys tend to use these sites alone) and if a woman gets all her female friends to come on board, that helps solve the female-male ratio.",1215645210

And then you need some heuristics to predict which tactic is going to follow which tactic. It's a slippery slope, I guess.<p>I don't know where to draw the line myself. It can be argued that as soon as something is modeled by a computer it ceases to be psychology and becomes mundane math. But I do still believe that most tactics people use to trick others with need to show up in the code in some way.<p>I won't use the ""Clearly you've never done x"" line again.

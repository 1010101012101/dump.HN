9098994,comment,9098501,9098848,0,0,TheSpiceIsLife,,,"I&#x27;ll quote straight from Steven Pinker&#x27;s &#x27;The Better Angels of Our Nature&#x27;:<p>---
Once again it seems to me that the appropriate response is “maybe, but maybe not.” Though climate change can cause plenty of misery and deserves to be mitigated for that reason alone, it will not necessarily lead to armed conflict. The political scientists who track war and peace, such as Halvard Buhaug, Idean Salehyan, Ole Theisen, and Nils Gleditsch, are skeptical of the popular idea that people fight wars over scarce resources.290 Hunger and resource shortages are tragically common in sub-Saharan countries such as Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania, but wars involving them are not. Hurricanes, floods, droughts, and tsunamis (such as the disastrous one in the Indian Ocean in 2004) do not generally lead to armed conflict. The American dust bowl in the 1930s, to take another example, caused plenty of deprivation but no civil war. And while temperatures have been rising steadily in Africa during the past fifteen years, civil wars and war deaths have been falling. Pressures on access to land and water can certainly cause local skirmishes, but a genuine war requires that hostile forces be organized and armed, and that depends more on the influence of bad governments, closed economies, and militant ideologies than on the sheer availability of land and water. Certainly any connection to terrorism is in the imagination of the terror warriors: terrorists tend to be underemployed lower-middle-class men, not subsistence farmers.291 As for genocide, the Sudanese government finds it convenient to blame violence in Darfur on desertification, distracting the world from its own role in tolerating or encouraging the ethnic cleansing.<p>In a regression analysis on armed conflicts from 1980 to 1992, Theisen found that conflict was more likely if a country was poor, populous, politically unstable, and abundant in oil, but not if it had suffered from droughts, water shortages, or mild land degradation. (Severe land degradation did have a small effect.) Reviewing analyses that examined a large number (N) of countries rather than cherry-picking one or two, he concluded, “Those who foresee doom, because of the relationship between resource scarcity and violent internal conflict, have very little support in the large-N literature.&quot; Salehyan adds that relatively inexpensive advances in water use and agricultural practices in the developing world can yield massive increases in productivity with a constant or even shrinking amount of land, and that better governance can mitigate the human costs of environmental damage, as it does in developed democracies. Since the state of the environment is at most one ingredient in a mixture that depends far more on political and social organization, resource wars are far from inevitable, even in a climate-changed world.<p>---<p>Should we do nothing about climate change? Probably not. Panicking is not likely to help either. Given that the Cold War didn&#x27;t end in a scorched earth I do believe we are capable of pulling together and dealing with what&#x27;s in front of us.<p>(Edit: formatting)",1424757015

Would you rather I just call you a liar, instead?<p>I&#x27;d rather you not call me anything. As I said, it doesn&#x27;t matter who I am. That&#x27;s not the issue I&#x27;m interested in.<p>Likewise, I have not called you any names--I care only about the arguments you make.<p>>  in the real world, we theorycraft before we invest using that miracle of nature, our ability to model and predict the future in our heads.<p>That is my point. If we only invest in making anything we can predict will succeed, and avoid potential failures, a device like a smartphone would not have existed, because I was there when companies like Apple tried to launch PDAs like the Newton, and the world did not care. Based on prediction, smartphones would not gain traction in the consumer market. And yet, the iPhone made that happen<p>Same for iPods--&quot;Hundreds of dollars for a music player? Everyone would get a $30 sony&quot;. It was only with a lot of conviction pushing a &quot;theoretically blank&quot; idea, that the smartphone industry became what it is today.<p>If we only invest in things that seem &quot;not dumb&quot; in &quot;theorycraft&quot;, a lot of the successful startups today would not exist. Success requires experimenting on things that may not seem obvious at first.<p>> Amaze me.<p>1. I don&#x27;t need to amaze you. You as an individual are not that important.<p>This is especially true if you are the type of person who sits and waits to be amazed. The most important people in the world go out and amaze others, as opposed to waiting to be amazed by others<p>2. Ideas are not dumb until they are proven good. They are ideas until proven wrong. You don&#x27;t get to dismiss an idea with near-certainty that they are &quot;dumb&quot;, until you&#x27;ve actually tried it out yourself and can prove that it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>> I&#x27;m willing to be shown wrong<p>That is not true. Someone who is willing to be shown wrong, would encourage others to try new ideas, even ones that are not apparent successes &quot;in theory&quot;, or &quot;dumb&quot;<p>From the conversation so far, it sounds like you are not supportive of investing in ideas that are not proven in theorycraft. Based on the conversation alone, and the trust you put in theorycraft, it does not look like you want to be proven wrong.",1424756866

9098988,comment,9098501,9098828,0,0,kevin_nisbet,,,"This was also the part I found most interesting.<p>Over the past several months, I&#x27;ve been putting an increasing level of thought into how people reach conclusions and investigate technical problems, and looking at things like confirmation bias, and I see it happen in myself and others.<p>The best example I have, is a vendor I work with had an outage in their platform, and we spent weeks going through the data, where the vendor jumped to a conclusion about the cause of the outage, even though it poorly or in no way explained the data we had compiled. No matter how hard I tried, I was not able to convince this vendor that the conclusion they reached was incorrect, every piece of evidence, was manipulated in a way to explain their theory. That is until they developed the fix, applied it, and had another outage occur after they thought they fixed it.<p>It troubles me, to know that we wasted so much effort, due to these biases.<p>While not 100% related, one story I like to remind myself of to try and disrupt my own biases, goes something along the lines of:
- A little girl was helping her mom make banana bread one day, and asks her mom, why do you cut the ends off before you serve it.
- The mom replies, I don&#x27;t know, that&#x27;s the way my mom always made it.
- Next they ask the girls grand mother, why did you cut the ends off the bread
- She replies, I don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s the way I always made it.
- They manage to ask the great grand mother, why did you cut the ends off...
- The response was, my serving plate was too small, so I used to cut the ends off so it would fit on the plate.<p>If anyone knows the attribution for that story, it would be great, I&#x27;m unable to find it so my recollection is probably wrong. However, I still really like this story, as I use it as a way to remind myself and others, that we need to be ready to question everything, when it comes to understanding a problem. It doesn&#x27;t mean that we can afford to question every bias, but it does mean that we need to gain enough evidence to corroborate any theory that may come up, or if necessary, invalidate it.<p>Where I work, I believe it&#x27;s something we need to spend greater effort on, is questioning our biases and make sure we&#x27;re reaching the right conclusions.",1424756835

Another reason is due probably to the good integration with the Tk UI library that allows to easily associate a UI interface to some of the scripting tasks, something that is highly appreciated by many engineers: this is not easy to accomplish if you use Pyhton or Perl.

9098972,comment,9098617,9098617,0,0,pslam,,,"TCL is an incredibly useful language to quickly construct small code snippets in, and is especially good as a REPL language - as a command line interface.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s the bane of my life. It&#x27;s particularly bad (and verbose) at anything involving expressions. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s mostly where I find it being used, because it&#x27;s very popular in hardware. You&#x27;ll find it being used for emulators, simulator, FPGAs, JTAG interfaces, and so on. There, it&#x27;s shuffling a lot of data around, and in particular performing bitfield operations. It&#x27;s notoriously verbose at doing all of that.<p>Hardware register definitions and the like are also usually expressed in a C-like fashion - that is to say they&#x27;re usually using square brackets e.g &quot;some_reg[2]&quot; notation. This is annoying for TCL, because square brackets are its &quot;string eval replace&quot; construction, so you end up escaping stuff.<p>Its error traceback, usually &quot;puts $errorInfo&quot;, is also awkward and often doesn&#x27;t give you the right locality of where the error was, especially if it&#x27;s syntax-related. One of the most infuriating aspects is that the comment character &quot;#&quot; doesn&#x27;t obey the rules you see in other languages - it&#x27;s not like a pre-processed character. Scope rules <i>still apply</i> within comments, e.g you can open a proc definition and it&#x27;ll complain about a dangling brace because it <i>still parses the comment line contents</i>.<p>The everything-is-a-string design is awesome but also makes it inherently slow, to the extent that even on a modern system it can end up being the bottleneck in execution. It also results in really weird parameter passing rules between functions. I&#x27;m not a fan of having to occasionally add magic intermediate string evaluation steps, or the wildcard expansions necessary for passing lists. It&#x27;s error-prone and sometimes feels like just hammering the interpreter until it <i>Does What I Mean</i>.<p>Everything-is-a-string is also damn dangerous, and can result in arbitrary code execution if you&#x27;re not careful. Anyone who&#x27;s ever run an IRC script or bot has probably experienced this, and knows what I mean.<p>That&#x27;s not to say Tcl is crappy. It&#x27;s just a language which was designed in another age, and it&#x27;s really showing it. It&#x27;s awesome as a command line REPL, but I highly recommend something else (Python or Lua) if you&#x27;re doing anything even moderate scale behind the interface.",1424756657

Add robots and that mechanism is destroyed.<p>Moreover, is something really worth fighting for if nations wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have the will to commit human troops?<p>Well, yes. Modern political reality is such that large military occupations for humanitarian purposes are incredibly unpopular, and suggesting the mere prospect of such operations is tantamount to political suicide.<p>Bad actors know this dynamic, and they exploit it with knowledge that western countries will almost certainly not intervene, allowing them to operate with impunity. Recent history points to genocide in Rwanda and Darfur as being prime examples.<p>Robotic infantry, built and deployed to any reasonable standard, tend to solve this problem.<p>The article cites concerns over increased civilian casualties if we were to deploy autonomous weapons platforms. On the contrary, like self-driving cars, it&#x27;s likely that machine control would result in safer outcomes. In the case of robotic infantry, you&#x27;re talking sensors and weapons that far exceed human capability in their capacity to be surgical. Combined with the fact that self-preservation could easily take lower precedence to preserving civilian life, and it seems clear that the net result would be a decrease in civilian casualties.<p>To be fair, the article&#x27;s spirit likely was intended primarily in the context of aerial drones, and I admit turning drones into autonomous killing machines is almost certainly a bad idea, unless drones significantly ramp up their sensor capabilities and start using bullets instead of bombs.<p>If autonomous robots with the authority to kill are what it takes to make genocide a thing of the past and bring social change to countries where women are still considered property, and where not subscribing to the mandated faith results in death, then so be it.<p>Banning domestic use of such robots in developed countries would be a fantastic idea, however. Even any less-than-lethal forms.",1424756637

9098955,comment,9098501,9098766,0,0,mikekchar,,,"This is a common misinterpretation of Occam&#x27;s Razor, IMHO.  Simple explanations are not more likely to be true.  What Occam&#x27;s Razor says is that if you have 2 theories that fit the same data, you should pick the simplest one.  Why?  Because it is simpler, not because it is more likely to be true.<p>It is important to remember that when we are dealing with scientific theories, we are not really all that concerned with truth.  Are Newton&#x27;s laws &quot;true&quot;?  Well, they work reliably given certain constraints and they are definitely more simple than other theories, so it would be stupid not to use them.  However, there are data to show that Newton&#x27;s laws don&#x27;t hold in other situations.  Newton&#x27;s laws are not &quot;truth&quot; -- they are useful.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that a scientific theory must make predictions which are falsifiable.  In other words, it must not only fit data in the past, it must continue to fit data into the future.  If your idea has no predictions, then it isn&#x27;t a scientific theory to begin with and Occam&#x27;s Razor doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>In this case, the author has a theory which (presumably -- I haven&#x27;t checked) fits the data in the past.  Even if we had a simpler theory that also fits the data, we couldn&#x27;t invoke Occam&#x27;s Razor, because neither theory makes predictions about the future.  The event is already finished and will not happen again.  With Occam&#x27;s Razor, I&#x27;m saying, &quot;Well, we could imagine it to be like X or like Y and no matter how you slice it, it&#x27;s going to work the same.  I will pick X because it is simpler&quot;.  But with this event, it makes a huge difference which &quot;theory&quot; I pick, so I can&#x27;t use Occam&#x27;s Razor.<p>Even if I could pick two equivalent theories -- let&#x27;s say I had a theory that the plane crashed into a mountain and I had another theory that said the plane did a loop-de-loop and then crashed into the mountain.  Maybe both ideas fit the data in the past and I could go and verify that the plane ended up crashing into the mountain.  Both theories fit the data in the past and fit data in the future.  I&#x27;ll pick the simplest one because, hey, it really doesn&#x27;t matter if the plane did a loop-de-loop before it crashed.<p>Now, maybe some people really care about the loop-de-loop.  If they can&#x27;t find any data that supports the loop-de-loop but doesn&#x27;t support the straight-on-crash, then we are still going to reject the loop-de-loop theory.  Why needlessly complicate things when there is no data to differentiate the two theories?  But this does <i>not</i> mean that the plane did not do a loop-de-loop.  There is no justification for saying that at all.  We don&#x27;t have any data to support one position or the other.  We are just accepting the simple answer because it makes our lives easy.<p>Where most people get this wrong is:
- They try to apply it to non-scientific theories.
- They try to apply it to a single theory rather than a set of equivalent theories.
- They try to apply it to a set of non-equivalent theories.
- They believe that the result is &quot;true&quot;.<p>That last one is pernicious because if you believe that something is true just because it is the simplest explanation that fits your data, you have stepped from science to religion.",1424756338

As is mentioned in the article, the government correctly argues that congress doesn&#x27;t even have to be right, it just has to have a &quot;rational basis&quot; for its action. In fact, the so long as the court can imagine a rational basis of action, even one that is totally unrelated to the legislative history, the government can prevail.<p>The government can easily argue a rational basis by saying &quot;Drugs are bad mkay? While there may be some medicinal uses (which we deny), even if they existed we think that there are better substitutes distilled by pharmaceutical companies in each case presented by the plaintiffs.

It&#x27;s not easy, as many companies won&#x27;t sponsor H1-Bs at all, but the real kicker is that most H1-Bs, me included, wanted to stay longer than the 6 year maximum.<p>We see H1-B as the one way to stay permanently. First you get an H1-B, and maybe in the middle of it, or at the start of the second one, you get your company to sponsor you for a Green Card. If you have real qualifications, it&#x27;s a very high probability process, but it&#x27;s very slow. Back when I did it at least, it was VERY, VERY slow. During the process, you can keep renewing your H1-B a third, and even a fourth time, past the 6 year maximum, so barring the company going belly up, or a layoff, you&#x27;ll eventually be able to stay forever, and get paid real market rates. But during the process, changing jobs is very hard, as changing jobs at the wrong time can make you have to start the process all over again. You might also have had to sign an agreement paying back the costs incurred if you leave before it&#x27;s all done + 1 year, and that can be 15K, easy, so it&#x27;s a big deterrent to change jobs.<p>In my case, I had mild salary increases while I was getting the green card.

I like to think that I am capable of reading most technical <i>things</i> and evaluating them with a healthy skepticism, but at a certain point, I know that I just have to trust people who are <i>smarter</i> than me.<p>One thing I try to pay attention to is consensus.  It&#x27;s probably very <i>easy</i> to get duped by a single voice that&#x27;s smarter than you (or just knows more about a specific subject), but it&#x27;s less probable that a bunch of those people are all in on it together.  The larger the consensus, the easier it is to trust.<p>I <i>think</i> I have read (source?) that the consensus level on the broad category of climate change and whether it&#x27;s likely to end badly for us is pretty near the high 90% if not close to the 99-100% mark.  But then when it comes to the more detailed bits like how bad, and how soon, that&#x27;s where I don&#x27;t know who to listen to.  Any suggestions?<p>[1] - I don&#x27;t like the word debate here because it feels loaded, but I can&#x27;t think of a better one.<p>Update: I feel silly even amending this, but upon re-reading my post, I see there may be some doubt as to whether I <i>believe</i> in climate change.  I do, and only after a healthy amount of research and some level of blind trust in consensus of people more knowledgeable than myself.  The uncertainty I have is around what the effects will be, how severe, and how soon.  The answers to those help to inform my choices on how to go about helping fix it.",1424754714

In foreign affairs, states are mostly rational and risk-averse. The risk involved in such an operation would have been astronomical:<p>- It stretches the imagination that in the Post-9/11 world, hijackers could access a panel in the cabin without raising passenger and crew suspicion. So the hijackers would have required some way to control the passengers. Smuggling this past airport security is already a huge risk to the operation.<p>- The northern route may be the optimal route for someone looking to avoid detection, but there is still a massive risk that one of these countries might notice the plane on military or other radar. This would be an unqualified disaster to the sponsors of the operation.<p>- The most probable final ping locations are so far out that the aircraft was almost certainly at or on the verge of fuel exhaustion. How would the hijackers have known the precise amount of fuel on board? How would they deal with unexpectedly high head winds, or some other in-flight issue? Any crash landing would be difficult to conceal.<p>The sophistication, danger, and lack of motivation for such an operation makes this sound more like a movie plot than a credible theory.",1424754711

He apparently doesn't care about those, though, from what he says.  Since he actually cares mostly about the caffeine, and since high levels of caffeine produce mood swings for him (and me), going off coffee would seem to be the solution he wants.<p>Personally, I'm willing to put up with the mood swings, since it's not so much really high and really low as really, really high and kinda low. :)  But that's just me.",1256424975

I've been a fan of these watershoes for adults: <a href=""http://www.rei.com/product/780680?cm_mmc=cse_froogle-_-datafeed-_-product-_-780680&mr:trackingCode=C837B1FE-FB85-DE11-B7F3-0019B9C043EB&mr:referralID=NA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rei.com/product/780680?cm_mmc=cse_froogle-_-dataf...</a><p>They stay on really well, and when combined with neoprene booties provide the best cold water/mountain river shoe I've ever found.  I use these when I go kayaking or try to hike up a stream or creek.<p>They're not that much more expansive, but provide a significantly improved experience, and look a lot nicer.

901011,comment,900436,900924,0,0,indiejade,,,"<i>Wouldn't that make so much more sense (by orders of magnitude) than build a floating airport?</i><p>Not necessarily.  Look at the long-term impact of building a one-road-in and one-road-out solution into the desert vs. a potentially multi-routing solution for something on the water.  It's no accident that the coastlines of the USA were populated first, and are currently the most densely populated areas of the country.  Logistically-speaking, the multi-variant nature of water trails makes much more sense.",1256424451

Seriously ?<p>You think maybe that errrm, toddlers or gradeschoolers or writers are going to be as adept as technical people at blowing stuff up or destroying it ?<p>The Army corps of <i>engineers</i> is just as good at putting stuff together as they are at taking it apart.<p>Of course technical people would be the ones you find behind successful acts of destruction.<p>But that does not mean that <i>all</i> engineering and hard-science types are more likely to become terrorists.<p>It just means that if you take a random sampling of people and you test them for terrorist potential you will find that the technical ones will do better at it.<p>If this is the 'right attitude', then why bother letting those scary muslims have any education at all ? Maybe we should bomb all those schools, that way they're certainly not going to be engineers and science types.<p>Bollocks.<p>What I think is that if having an education will make them less susceptible to brainwashing. Engineering takes skill and critical thought.<p>If that means that the few engineers that will go through this program ending up as terrorists will be better at it, then that's just too bad, but as a scheme education certainly beats arming opposing groups (the normal way to deal with this problem).",1256424317

Hence the name.<p>2.  Israel is one country while this is to many countries.

And dollar-for-dollar, US companies still seem to get more out of engineering investments than overseas companies do (even when they're using workers who immigrated).

900998,comment,900998,899636,0,0,anamax,,,"Type systems that are concerned with representation and range of primitive values aren't very useful.  Replacing representation/structure with type names doesn't improve things.<p>If I'm adding 3.5 oz of OJ to 6.7 oz of vodka, that's either a programming mistake or a strong drink (represented programatically).  (Yes, the correct answer depends on context.)  A type system that helps me in that situation is worth something.<p>A type system that only addresses representation and range of primitive values can't even begin to help in that situation.<p>Yes, units are a partial solution.

900996,comment,900382,900382,0,0,bwoodacre,,,"The easiest way to get a sense for the difference between the laws is to look at their mathematical statements. From the sheer magnitude of the forces induced, electrostatic repulsion of like charges (Coloumb's law) is ~10^23 times more strong between two electrons than the attractive force between their mass as given by the law of gravity; for protons (which have more mass & opposite but equal charge) you lose a few orders of magnitude, but the margin is still ~10^20. But gravity always attracts, while electrostatics may attract or repulse, so when you consider a real situation then things like your falling example get more complicated. I prefer just to remember the difference in their magnitudes.",1256423280

(USAF officer, former SR-71 driver, got to fly the shuttle carrier loaded as a special treat.)

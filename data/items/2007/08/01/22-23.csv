38519,comment,38485,38485,0,0,nickb,,,"OK, I was contracting in my previous life so I've seen these issues pop up many times before. Here's few words.<p>A) is illegal. You have no ownership of ANY code or IP that you work on at the company that employs you. That's what they're paying you for, after all.<p>B) is also illegal. Unless the company in question has open sourced their code and allows anyone to use it under some kind of a BSD-like license, you have absolutely no right to use that code or IP.<p>Not only are both of these cases illegal, they're also highly unethical. Also, if you're forming a company around someone else's IP, you're gonna crash and burn.<p>When I worked as a contractor, I would use my own libraries to save me some time but before I used them, I notified the management that I was using them and told them that I own the code and that I give them full right to use it without any licensing fees and I also told them I would use them on my other contracting jobs. They always accepted these stipulations an I've never had any problems. They loved the fact that I was not wasting my time and their money re-implementing the wheel and that I was solving their problems in record time. The key is to be open and put it all on the table before you start working.<p>Also, after I'd finish working on a project and if I was using my own computer, I'd wipe my computer clean of all of their code. I would do that on the last day of my job and I ALWAYS made sure that someone from the management was there to witness it. Sure, that might be going overboard but trust me... it's worth it. It shows them that you care about these sorts of things and it also makes sure that they won't have a strong case if they ever decide to sue you down the road because you end up inventing something amazing that's in their marketspace or you end up working for competition.",1186008832

The other problem that he didn't really get into is the sheer size of the dataset, the .txt files are about 4GB in size to hold the 100,480,507 ratings ...<p>Beyond that I think he missed the really interesting ideas behind the recommender system possibilities. Once a user has enough ratings on movies and there is enough of a cross section of other users rating the same movies the math of the problem starts to create a profile of the user. With that profile it is more likely to be able to find the things the user will find interesting instead of just what the crowd voted most popular.<p>The real trick is not to use some artificial error measuring method to validate how your algorithm is working but instead to focus on how the recommendation system changes the way the user interacts with your website.<p>The Netflix prize did a few things that where wonderful for the process of recommendation system, they brought a lot of attention to the field and they gave a huge dataset for people to compare their results with. In the long run, even if no one wins the grand prize, they will have give much more to the field of study then the $1 million.<p>Oh yeah .. and maybe this January there will be one more YC start-up doing recommendation systems.",1186008473

What you're suggesting is completely unprecedented on the internet. What always happens is that an open forum is eventually overwhelmed by trolls and morons, and all the smart people give up. There has never been a case where a troll or a moron turned into a useful contributor because of thoughtful response from a good member of a forum. Just review the history of Digg, Slashdot, Reddit and almost any other open forum, all the way back to ancient USENET times...<p>Wasn't this forum created partially because reddit was overwhelmed by the hordes and all the interesting startup information was lost in the noise?\n",1186007661

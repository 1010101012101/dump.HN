There's a non-profit news startup here in Chicago called the Chicago News Coop that also had a similar goal when they started up.  But instead of making a cool new product and taking lessons from hacker culture, they went out and stole away the crown jewel reporters from the Tribune and the local alt. weekly.

1765797,comment,1764730,1764730,0,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"I know that since 'the good parts' it's almost become the ironic t-shirt of the programming world, but I really love JavaScript, here's some of my reasoning:<p>1. By now everyone knows of JavaScript's functional features, which I must admit are awesome, but many other languages share these. But what few languages share regarding these is they're a very common part of standard js programming.  A lot of new python and even ruby programmers have never touched the functional features of the language, but even a copy & paste js 'programmer' has probably written a lambda function, used a first class function, and maybe even used a closure.<p>2. It's fundamentally different than most other other languages. I love Haskell and it's awesome type system, but I also love JavaScript and it's true rejection of a type system, even throwing out classed based inheritance for prototypical.  It's also a world where events and asynchronous computing are completely commonplace. What's interesting about this is that it is related to number 1, in other words it is an extremely practical application of principles of functional programming.  Having written my share of parallel C code, writing concurrent/parallel code is much more of a pain without basic features of a functional language.  On top of this being able to easily implement things like currying is actually pretty amazing.  At the same time the language is very, very simple at it's core.<p>3. The above 2 reasons are things I would expect from a less popular and therefore harder to distribute language. Common Lisp is definitely more interesting of a language than JavaScript, but if I want to share something I've done in Common Lisp with someone, they better also be a fan of the language.  On the other hand if I make something really cool in JS I can easy share it with anyone, even people who think IE is the 'internet'.  Also I'm pretty sure that more people of varying skill levels can read JavaScript than any other language.  So if I want to demonstrate something, for a very general audience JavaScript is much better than C, and for demonstrating functional programming techniques it's worlds better than Lisp or ML.",1286398188

I failed, but it was an amusing story.<p>I though ""well, first I need to sell some books, so I know what it's actually like""   I'd hit craigslist for anyone wanting to move more than 500 books for under $0.10 per.    At my peak I think I was approaching 10,000 books.   Yes, I learned what it was like to be a book seller, but I got so distracted by actually selling that my software never amounted to anything salable.  I eventually gave up when the competition's software reached a certain level of quality.<p>It was fun, though.  did you know the barcodes on mass market paperbacks don't have ISBNs?   trade paperbacks and hardcover paperbacks usually have ISBNs right on the barcodes, but not mass market paperbacks.<p>Mass market paperbacks have a publisher specific prefix, then the last four digits of the ISBN... so what I did was I created a lookup table that went from the publisher prefix to the ISBN prefix.  whenever the software hit a unknown publisher prefix, it would ask the users to input the full ISBN by hand, from which it could fill in the database for that publisher prefix.<p>It was a lot of fun, but aside from getting distracted by actually selling books, I was focusing on the inventory control aspects of it... I was not picky about the sort of books I bought, so the vast majority would sit in inventory forever, and bring a dollar after shipping if they ever did sell.  I talked about some kind of PDA scanner you could take to booksales, but I was obsessed with figuring out how to automatically identify the pre-barcode books (which seemed to be where the real money was)  rather than going for the low-hanging fruit, the barcode books that were worth a few bucks.<p>my vast collection was donated to my brothers, who I think ran the bookselling software for a month before deciding it wasn't worth it.

No amount of reasoning will change them. As an anecdotal example: I knew a kid that was bullied in High School constantly by another kid. I and a few others told the bully many times to lay off and nobody thought it was funny. So the bully wasn't doing it to impress anyone else or anything like that - he was just a dick. Then one day the kid being picked on snapped and pushed the bully...knowing full well a fight would start. The kid also knew the bully would most likely beat his ass.  Well, unbeknown to the kid pushing back (and fortunately), there was a ledge with a shallow guard rail behind the bully that the bully fell back against and over the guard rail and then fell over the ledge. The bully fell about 15 feet to the ground and got hurt pretty badly.  Had the bully not been hurt...not only would he have beat the kids ass but he would have continued to bully the kid - that I have no doubt in my mind.  However, the bully never bothered that kid again after he recovered from his injuries.",1286397770

And being a guy, this really applies to guys, girl bullying is a different dynamic.<p>The best way to overcome a childhood bully is to get in an old fashioned schoolyard fistfight with them. It doesn't matter if you loose, just don't loose badly. Fight them until your face is bloodied and your nose is broken, until your knuckles hurt, and you can barely move. Cheat, use blunt objects (no biting or weirdness), sucker punch, tackle, throw dirt in their eyes, whatever. No sharp weapons or anything that'll do permanent damage. You aren't fighting for honor here, this isn't feudal Japan. You're fighting for street credit.<p>If you're winning, stop when he stops. Make the exchange free of emotion and a cold business negotiation.<p>If he tries to fight you with a bunch of buddies, do whatever you can to move it in front of a neutral crowd.<p>9 times out of 10, they won't even show for the fight. When they do, put on a good show.<p>If you make it so troublesome to be a target, no matter how weird you are, they'll leave you alone. You have to make it a bad equation for them to pick on you. They pick on you because something is bad in their lives and they have to pick on somebody and by not fighting back you make it easy for them to use you as the outlet for their problems. Make it not easy, introduce friction into that equation.<p>If you do fight, 9 times out of 10, you'll end up being their friend and most of the time you'll find out that the bullies really have shitty life stories and need a friend.<p>Treat the bully like an angry dog, don't turn your back, don't run. Slow movements. He's not bullying you out of a rational decision, he's doing it out of instinct. He's a dumb and dangerous animal you should treat that way.<p>In my experience one fight is generally enough.",1286397459

It just took too damned long and frustrated everyone that has been patient enough to wait for it for years.<p>Reminds me of that old Mitch Hedberg joke, ""You will either hate us or love us... or you'll think we're ok.""<p>Were you the kind of kid who had their Christmas morning ruined because you had to wait 364 days for it to happen? Everyone groaned when the AT&T exclusivity agreement was announced, but widely understood that it would be <i>years</i> before you could get the phone on another carrier. I'd argue that while it was a polarizing move, publicized exclusivity actually <i>helped</i> the sales of the iPhone. You either accepted that you'd have to use AT&T and got the phone regardless of the service, or you didn't. Anyone waiting with baited breath for a second carrier in the US was either ignorant, stupid, or both. The options were clear. Now that exclusivity is about to be over there is a second wave of adoption coming. Why? Because the things that made the phone worth buying to begin with are still there, and the only deal-breaker for most people is going away. Everyone who ""needed"" an iPhone already has one. Everyone who ""likes"" the iPhone is about to have it be an option.<p>I would <i>love</i> to see the facts supporting your hypothesis that, ""AT&T gave up its exclusivity deal with Apple for the iPhone back in the spring of this year. Verizon and other insiders had to have known well in advance that they were going to. They should have been ready for a release in July, at the latest."" You're making assertions about the strategy for the next phase of one of the most popular consumer electronic devices <i>ever</i>, and you're backing them up with the word ""should.""",1286397344

Pair 1 is simple userid/simple pwd, for throwaway accounts I don't care about.  Pair 2 is moderately complex userid/pwd for sites I use frequently but could afford to lose/be hacked/whatever.  And Pair 3 is highly complex userid/pwd for online banking and other secure things that need the highest penetration barrier.<p>Since I can easily keep three in memory and apply each one based on how I categorize the website in question, I never forget my logins to any websites, no matter how frequent or infrequent I use them.  Nor do I ever have to write down or otherwise record my login info, anywhere, since it's easy to remember just three.  Further, if one my lower level userid/pwd pairs is cracked, it doesn't compromise the critical one.<p>For your site I would have simply use Pair 1 or 2, problem solved.  However, your pass phrase method presents a problem - I can use one of my passwords in plain text, which I'm obviously not going to do, or I can think up some pass phrase that is unique to your site, not part of my system, and hence easily forgettable.<p>I have no idea what other systems people use to manage their logins across the tons of websites in use these days, but I'd suggest relying on your users (especially since they're 100% savy HN users) to have already solved this login problem.  Leverage their solutions by using the norm.  Or use OpenID, which is another solution to this problem.",1286396508

I can't compare it in over-all usability to other smart phones as I haven't lived day in day out with a smart phone.<p>* The way applications are organized is interesting. Instead of merely having a mongo huge list of apps, apps can also register themselves in app hubs. So applications that manipulate photos will show up under your photos, applications that deal with music show up there, etc. I'm not totally sold on this, but it seems like a good idea.<p>* Development for WP7 in silverlight is shockingly easy. And silverlight on WP7 runs super fast. Actually runs faster on the device than on my beefy desktop in emulator. Given the number of .NET developers I know that are registered for the WP7 marketplace I expect the MS app store to add applications at a blistering pace.<p>* There isn't yet an easy way to handle deploying WP7 phones in an enterprise, but I was told that this will be addressed later.

Perhaps you could share why you think Wikipedia is wrong? The article states:<p>""Sharia (Arabic شريعة Šarīʿa; [ʃaˈriːʕa], ""way"" or ""path"") is the sacred law of Islam. Muslims believe Sharia is derived from two primary Sources of Islamic law; namely, the divine revelations set forth in the Qur'an, and the sayings and example set by the Islamic Prophet Muhammad in the Sunnah. Fiqh (""jurisprudence"") interprets and extends the application of Sharia to questions not directly addressed in the primary sources by including secondary sources. These secondary sources usually include the consensus of the religious scholars embodied in ijma, and analogy from the Qur'an and Sunnah through qiyas. Shia jurists replace qiyas analogy with 'aql, or ""reason"".""<p>The article further explains that Sharia covers areas of life such as diet, dress code, sexuality, personal morality, and the punishments prescribed for crimes - the aspects of law in Islamic countries that Westerners view as harsh and sometimes barbaric. For example, punishing theft with hand amputation is part of Sharia. In five Islamic countries under Sharia law the crime of Sodomy is punishable by death.<p>""Sharia"" is no more a specific set of laws than Anglo-Saxon ""Common Law"". But it is a certain way of creating and judging law based on Islamic religious tradition that is incompatible with a modern secular state.<p>So if I were to use the term ""Sharia"" to refer to a strict and expansive system of law based on the Muslim religion, I would be correct.",1286395718

I suspect that we will move to a mixture of fusion, wind, and solar power long before our supply’s of fissile materials become an issue.  I also expect that our initial expansion into space will primarily involve exporting technology into space and collecting raw materials from space.  However, initial space exploration is going to have minimal impact on life on earth with few material goods being sent back and forth.  I also suspect that it’s going to take far longer than 1000 years before 1 billion people live outside the earths atmosphere.<p>Edit: The Americas where ""discovered"" 518 years ago and dispite being there for the taking and far more hospitable than space 200 million more people live in India than all of the Americas put together.",1286395583

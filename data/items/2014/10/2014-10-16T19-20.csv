8467255,comment,8467196,8467196,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Probably the most interesting thing from Apple today, in my opinion. The ability to buy short term plans from different providers effortlessly can turn my tablet into a much more versatile device, and increase competition and reduce long-term carrier lock-in.<p>It&#x27;s pretty sweet and if it can set a standard for phones then we&#x27;ll see carriers become true utilities between which customers can switch easily if they get poor service. In short, pretty awesome.<p>Today&#x27;s carrier system kind of feels like this dinosaur, like a landline... archaic and unnecessary. With so many people travelling, changing places, changing technology etc, it makes a lot of sense to move from subscriptions to short-time payments, and eventually, pay-per second of use on the fly, directly, without an account or monthly statement, with a push payment instead of a pull payment. (digital currencies being a key element here). Anyway, getting a bit too off-topic here, but cool first move by Apple for sure!",1413489519

8467252,story,,,2,0,philippnagel,"Could resources as a service work?",,"Hi,
I came up with this question while thinking about how broken the natural resources industry is.<p>Instead of buying natural resources and materials (only those that can be recycled completely (like glass, metals, paper, silicon, etc.)) to manufacture products, companies would sort of lease these from you.<p>Like that they can manufacture products like they used to. When the product has reached it&#x27;s end of life, it will be returned to us and scraped of the resources or materials we still own (the ones we previously leased to the manufacturing company). Then we will recycle, refine and resell these.<p>The incentive to lease for the buying companies would be the cheaper price. We can lease below market value, because once the first leased resources and materials find their way back to us, we don&#x27;t have to buy them anymore. Recycling is generally cheaper and environmentally friendlier. This strategy would definitely pay of in the long run.<p>I hope you understood the general concept!",1413489474

8467211,comment,8465956,8466375,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> UDP is just about as reliable or unreliable as IP.<p>Ok.<p>> It&#x27;s a shim on top of IP to let unprivileged users send IP datagrams that can be multiplexed back to the right user. (Hence the name: &quot;user&quot; datagram protocol.)<p>It&#x27;s mostly a way to send data in such a manner that you don&#x27;t need to do the full &#x27;call-setup-data-transmission-and-terminate&#x27; that would be required for other virtual circuit based protocols such as TCP when you don&#x27;t need all that luxury. So for protocols that carry small amounts of data in a manner where retrying is not a problem and where loss of a packet is not an immediate disaster. It&#x27;s also more suitable for real-time applications because of this than TCP (especially true for the first packet). Because of the fact that there is no virtual circuit a single listener can handle data from multiple senders.<p>The &#x27;USER&#x27; does not refer to unprivileged users but simply to users as opposed to system packets (such as for instance ICMP and other datagram like packets that are not usually sent out directly by applications). So it&#x27;s not a privilege matter but a matter of user-space vs system modules elsewhere in the stack.<p>> Lots of people talk about a &quot;TCP or UDP&quot; design decision, but that&#x27;s usually not the relevant question for an application developer.
It absolutely is.<p>>  Most UDP applications wouldn&#x27;t just blat their data directly into UDP datagrams,<p>They usually do exactly that.<p>> just like almost nobody blats their data directly into IP datagrams.<p>You&#x27;re comparing apples with oranges, IP is one layer and TCP and UDP are on another. So you&#x27;d have to compare UDP with TCP and then you&#x27;re back to that design decision again.<p>> Typical applications generally want some sort of transport protocol on top of the datagrams (whether UDP-in-IP or just plain IP), that cares about reliability and often about fairness.<p>Fairness is something that is usually not under control of the endpoints of a conversation but something that routers in between influence. They can decide to let a packet through or drop it (this goes for TCP as well as UDP), if a line is congested your UDP packets will usually (rules can be set to configure this) be dropped before your TCP packets will be in spite of the fact that TCP will re-try any lost packets. UDP packets can also be duplicated and routed in such a way that they arrive out-of-order.<p>> That could be TCP-over-IP, but some (like MixApp, which wanted TCP but not the kernel&#x27;s default implementation) use TCP-over-UDP-over-IP, BitTorrent uses LEDBAT-over-UDP, Mosh uses SSP-over-UDP, Chrome uses QUIC-over-UDP and falls back to SPDY-over-TCP and HTTP-over-TCP, etc.<p>Running alternative protocols packaged inside other protocols is a time honored practice. See also: TCP over carrier pigeons and tunneling HTTP over DNS traffic (effectively  using UDP). This is not in any way special, it&#x27;s just a means to an end.<p>> The idea that using UDP somewhere in the stack means &quot;designing and implementing a reliable transport protocol from scratch&quot; is silly. It doesn&#x27;t mean that any more than using IP does.<p>It actually comes down to exactly that. If you use UDP as your base <i>and</i> your application requires reliable transmission of data then you&#x27;re going to have to deal with loss/duplication/sequencing at some other point in your application or put another (pre existing) protocol on top of it in order to mitigate these.<p>If your application can tolerate those errors (or if they are not considered errors) then a naive implementation will do.<p>> The question of SOCK_STREAM vs. SOCK_DGRAM is more typically, &quot;Does the application want to use the one transport protocol that the kernel implements, namely a particular flavor of TCP, or does it want to use some other transport protocol implemented in a userspace library?&quot;<p>TCP is the default for anything requiring virtual circuits if you have demands that are not well describe by that model and/or need real time, low overhead and you&#x27;re willing to do the work required to deal with UDPs inherent issues (if those are a problem) then you&#x27;re totally free to do so.<p>But the question is usually not &#x27;do I need TCP&#x27;, it usually is &#x27;how do I avoid re-implementing TCP if I need its features&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s a tough choice because at a minimum it means that you&#x27;re going to have to write software for both endpoints.<p>This is one of the reasons why we see HTTP over TCP in so many places where it wasn&#x27;t originally intended: it is more or less guaranteed to be well tested and there are tons of tools available to use this protocol combination, especially browsers, fetchers and servers in all kinds of flavors. For UDP that situation is much less rosy and using UDP always translates into having to do a bunch of plumbing yourself.",1413489139

Blue collar workers are often paid via hourly wages.<p>Brown collar: a subset of blue collar.  The differentiating factor is that these people work outdoors.  The brown is often explained by dirt on the collar, but in reality, most people who use this term use it because this type of worker is overwhelmingly likely to be a dark-skinned person.<p>Khaki collar: a subset of blue collar.  Used for military jobs.<p>White collar: an individual whose earnings are derived primarily from labor requiring specialized knowledge or skills.  White collar workers are often paid via weekly salary.<p>Tailored collar: a subset of white collar, except restricted to executive management, and possibly their immediate subordinates, depending on the size of the business.<p>Rich: an individual whose earnings are derived primarily from business ownership and investment returns.  Rich people may also work in one of the aforementioned categories, but most prefer to enjoy leisure activities, volunteer for charitable causes, manage their own property portfolio, or pursue political goals.<p>Additionally, we have some terms for class-related nuances.<p>Ghetto/Barrio/Trailer Trash/Crab Bucket: this person grew up in the lower class, and exhibits many of the negative qualities of people raised in an impoverished, survival-oriented environment.  These people are overwhelmingly ignorant of the social norms respected by higher classes.<p>Trust Fund Baby: this person grew up in the upper class, and exhibits many of the negative qualities of people raised in an affluent, self-realization-oriented environment.  These people are overwhelmingly ignorant of the social norms respected by lower classes.<p>Welfare Queen/Welfare King: this person has no desire to earn their living, and survives primarily on government benefits.  Ironically, these people often continue to receive benefits even as people who would rather work than be on the dole are cut off, because they are experts in gaming the bureaucracy.<p>Beltway Bandit: Welfare Royalty of the incorporated business variety.  So named for the Beltway bypass highway around Washington, D.C.<p>Ivory Tower/Academian: this person was raised to value education above all else, and somehow managed to not learn anything of actual value.  Usually white collar, but poor.<p>Hack: this person only does their job because it pays well.  Often compensates for job dissatisfaction and high earned income via conspicuous consumption and being a dick to co-workers.<p>Wage Slave: contrasts with Hack, in that they are paid only enough to survive and continue working.  These people would like to do something else, but cannot afford to support themselves at their preferred job.  In the US, this is often someone who would have attended college, but could not afford it.  May also be a person who graduated college, but cannot earn enough in their chosen field to pay off their student loans.<p>Brick/Backroom Boy: this person is absolutely competent and reliable in their job, and perform high-value work, so naturally other people stand on top of them and steal their credit.<p>Rainmaker: contrasts with Brick, in that they actually get some recognition for the value they produce.  Often the top-producing salespeople at a company are recognized as Rainmakers.",1413488284

I wrote some small programs in Python. I experimented briefly with Haskell. I now am writing a webapp in Clojure.

Instead UDP is the way to go when you don&#x27;t need a transport layer at all, and you can do with trivial ack / resend strategy (DNS is the obvious example), or just best-effort transfers where packet loss is not an issue at all (think a thermometer sending readings every second).

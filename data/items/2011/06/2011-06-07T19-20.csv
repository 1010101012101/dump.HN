You yourself think that projecting the tens of millions place 64 years in the future is an absurd number of significant digits. How many significant digits do you think is appropriate in a time frame 100M years longer? Even the UN itself only purports to project population trends until 2300, which is far short of a billion years, as hubristic as it is.<p>Also, the UN projections have some unjustified assumptions. From page 7, under section C:<p>>Over the long run,  
total fertility is projected to settle at 1.85 children 
per woman in each countryin between the current rate for Northern America (which is just below replacement level) and the rate for Europe (which is currently well below). This figure is somewhat arbitrary<p>In the longer run they expect the growth rate of all countries to stabilize at 0:<p>>The eventually similar growth between more 
developed and less developed regions is produced 
by similar long-range assumptions, especially the 
assumptions that fertility will fall in all countries 
below replacement (in the medium scenario) and 
rebound to replacement after a period largely 
similar across countries of a century or so. Starting their fertility declines later, less developed 
regions will reach low fertility levels after more 
developed regions but also stay at these levels 
until a later date.<p>Of course population stabilizes at a rate not too much higher than the present rate if you assume fertility rates converge around the replacement level. Garbage in, garbage out.",1307476546

2630588,comment,2628989,2630460,2,0,sorbus,,,"> If people want what Bitcoin provides.<p>That's the key point. There is a huge demand for alcohol, for drugs, and for cheap/free content. In the first two cases, this means that there is real profit to be had in selling it, and the illegality means that prices can be hugely inflated due to risk. For free content - ""car downloaders"" is a really nice way to describe it - I haven't yet figured out the economic motives, but it seems to be a mixture of selling ads (for the people running the sites), sharing/giving back to the community (especially on private, invitation-only trackers), and just because of how easy it is.<p>Is it possible to make money or karma off of bitcoins in a similar way? Well, you can sell them. If you have bitcoins, you can make a profit of them that way - you can sell them for above value, or charge for the service as well as the coins. You can also buy them, hoping that the price increases, which ends up as selling them.<p>So, answer this: if bitcoins were made illegal, what monetary incentive would there be to use them? Their price certainly wouldn't go up - it would plummet as all the legitimate traders tried to get out.",1307476307

You talk about capital costs... what do you imagine it will cost to convert a significant share of Saudi Arabia's generating capacity to nuclear, for example.  How likely is that to happen politically?  And if the day comes that oil is so expensive that an Arab nation is actually considering going nuclear, how financially feasible will a nuclear program be?  Remember, big construction projects drink a lot of diesel.<p>>""Shelf drilling is a capital expense, it's not recurring costs.""<p>It's more accurate to say that platform drilling incurs massive up-front capital investment, as well as intense ongoing maintenance.  Remember, we're not just talking about running the platform; we're talking about operating pipelines, refineries, etc.  The large capital cost is part of the problem -- see my earlier comment about large integrated projects.  But really, for EROEI purposes it doesn't matter <i>when</i> the money is spent; over its lifetime, an oil extraction project will consume a given amount of energy.

3874232,comment,3873801,3873801,1,0,nextparadigms,,,"I don't think anything but a campaign finance reform, that will cut the tie between companies and Government, will work.<p>Currently the strongest relationship is between Corporations <-> Government, and not People <-> Government. That's what's creating the whole mess. In other countries such strong ties with companies and so much funding from them would be considered illegal, and taken as bribing or corruption. But not in US. In US their crimes have been legalized.<p>So I think the only solution is to outright ban companies from donating to campaigns (that includes SuperPAC's and whatnot). There's an argument that what if a company needs to preserve its rights or something? Well, I don't see why a few people at the top of that company should decide that. If everyone working for that company thought their company is in danger because of a new legislation then they should all donate to their preferred candidate.<p>Of course such individual donations need to be capped to a few thousand dollars at most, too. Otherwise rich individuals can still donate millions at a time, which could easily make their candidate win a state or two. Do we really think that allowing <i>one</i> individual to completely change the outcome of an election within a state, is what's ""normal""?<p>The democratic vote is supposed to give everyone ""equal power"" to vote, and that's still true when you're literally talking about the vote. But there's also this virtual parallel vote, which is the money you can use to fund a politician, and right now that ""vote"" can dramatically skew the results, when cast by a few rich individuals or corporations. So you can see this as a loophole in the voting system. Even if millions of people have their vote equal, this parallel money-vote is not equal in power, and what's worse is that it's also used to influence the real vote.",1335078825

3874225,comment,3870964,3872799,1,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"The algorithms themselves are almost unaware of a path, they simply visit nodes, check their neighbours, then continue with another node from the queue. Breadth First Search simply does this in a predictable order, but of course it isn't prioritising nodes closest to the goal; that's where the other three come in. Every node has a path cost, how many moves it took to make it to the node. You can also define a distance heuristic, that calculates geometric distance to the goal as a strict underestimate. All these algorithms simply exit when the goal node is reached, and a path has been created by the algorithm.<p>Dijkstra, or also known as Uniform Cost Search, will pick nodes with the lowest path cost from the queue first. This works well on graphs, but not so well on open spaces. It should be mentioned that this algorithm is complete, and optimal. That is, it will find a path if one exists, and it will find the path of lowest path cost (note there may be many such paths of equal path cost).<p>Then we have A<i>, which is also complete and optimal. This uses the sum of path cost and distance heuristic. This means it will nodes closer to the goal, but long-windy paths will confuse it.<p>Finally we have Best First Search. It should be mentioned this is actually a family, of which Dijkstra and A</i> are members. In this program, it only considers distance heuristic. So nodes that are geometrically closer to the goal are evaluated first. It should be mentioned that it isn't optimal - it might not find the path of lowest cost. If the optimal path requires at first winds away form the goal, these nodes aren't considered until later, or maybe never.",1335078586

A great aunt bought me the Hobbit when I was around five, and I immediately took to the whole Lord of the Rings series, Silmarillion, etc. By 10 I'd read every Tolkien book I had ever heard of, including ones by his son that I didn't even realize. My best friend to this day was just as freakish, and it turns out not only was it pretty much what taught us how to read, but we kept track of many of the characters and stories the same way by drawing all of it. Personally, without them I don't know if I would have appreciated <i>books</i>, period. Some kids will go to great lengths to match with the things they're given, so there's certainly no harm in gifting a copy of at least the Hobbit and testing whether or not they'll really enjoy it.",1335078459

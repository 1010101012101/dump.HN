But what bothered me the most was that even if you did follow their strategy of build-powersats-in-place-out-of-extraterrestrial-materials, you could do it cheaper with workers in tin cans (and lots of automation and teleoperation) instead of livable colonies. The argument against this wasn&#x27;t too convincing, but I was a teenager and figured &quot;Hey, a <i>lot</i> can happen in a few decades.&quot; A lot more than actually did so far, sigh.<p>I still think large-scale work could have been done in space, and wasn&#x27;t more for societal than technical reasons.",1398063533
7620104,comment,7618871,7619112,4,0,lutusp,,,"> What makes you say that this kind of study can never ascend to the level of science?<p>Because the uncontrolled nature of the observations means evidence cannot be reliably collected in a way that separates one cause from any number of unintended causes and side effects. The only way to get around these obstacles would be to feed one group of people doses of lead and compare them to another in a controlled setting, or isolate two groups of people, give one group the right to birth control and abortions, deny the other group those rights, and keep them from finding out about each other. Things that cannot be done for ethical reasons, and things that prevent social psychology from rising to the level of science.<p>This is why social psychology cannot be a science, and it explains why the field has the terrible reputation it has and deserves.<p>Link: <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/As-Dutch-Research-Scandal/129746/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/article/As-Dutch-Research-Scandal/12974...</a><p>Quote: &quot;Even before the Stapel case broke, a flurry of articles had begun appearing this fall that pointed to supposed systemic flaws in the way psychologists handle data. But one methodological expert, Eric-Jan Wagenmakers, of the University of Amsterdam, added a sociological twist to the statistical debate: Psychology, he argued in a recent blog post and an interview, has become addicted to surprising, counterintuitive findings that catch the news media&#x27;s eye, and that trend is warping the field.&quot;<p>> Anyhow, I strongly disagree that you can say that this isn&#x27;t science.<p>Yes, I understand, but you haven&#x27;t the slightest idea what makes science science. If you did, you would recognize this sort of article for what it is.<p>Social psychology deserves its reputation, science operates at a higher level, this is Science 101, and you have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. Not a clue.<p>There is a one-word summary of what science requires, that word is known to every qualified scientist, and you do not know what it is. How do I know this?

All of the above can be fixed without having to tax those that create real wealth in the economy, however that isn&#x27;t going to happen as the banks have far too much influence in politics and even if they didn&#x27;t changing the situation without collapsing the current system seems  impossible at this stage.",1398062930

It is helping me clarify my thoughts, which for now can be summarized as:<p>1. Today, rich people have much better life than poor people.<p>2. Rich have higher chance of being rich tomorrow than poor folks. So that means they and their heirs have a higher chance of having a better life perpetually than ordinary folks and their heirs.<p>3. I don&#x27;t begrudge better lifestyle for those who earned it (Gates, Zuck, Buffet...), but I do think its grossly unfair to enjoy better lifestyle just because you were born to rich parents (Walton heirs, Koch heirs, Paris Hilton...).<p>4. If you think capitalism has improved things so much that differences in wealth hardly matter (or such will be the case in future), kindly provide me evidence. I don&#x27;t see it anywhere in my observations - eg. first class vs economy class experience in air travel, public schools vs private schools in the USA, job prospects for ivy league vs third tier univs, or even longevity[1] - rich people&#x27;s life is better in almost all aspects (some of those aspects might frivolous but some are very meaningful).<p>[1] : <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/us/23health.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/us/23health.html?_r=0</a>",1398062788

7620046,comment,7619234,7619234,3,0,beloch,,,"First off, let&#x27;s take a moment to appreciate what we&#x27;ve got.  Gasoline is fantastically dense in energy. Approximately 46 MJ/kg! Ethanol is about half as energy dense, which is why it is usually mixed with petroleum gasoline. Engines must be specifically designed to operate on pure ethanol. Going from the numbers quoted on Tesla&#x27;s site, their Roadster&#x27;s lithium ion battery packs have an energy density of 0.456 MJ/kg.  If you want to have the same range, electric vehicles have to devote over a hundred times more weight to batteries than gas-guzzlers do to their tank contents. To make matters worse, spent gasoline weighs nothing while spent batteries weigh the same as full batteries.  Electric motors are mechanically simpler/lighter and innovative design can carve even more weight off of new vehicle designs, but there is a very good reason why cheap, long-range pure electric vehicles are still a ways off. Lithium ion batteries are also pretty nasty things to produce in terms of environmental impact.  It&#x27;s debatable if a plug-in electric vehicle run off of solar/wind/etc. power actually has less impact than a small gasoline car does at present.  If the power used comes from coal then an electric car is actually a huge step in the wrong direction. Also note that the U.S. is not a major producer of Lithium, so dependency on foreign nations is not broken by switching to electric cars.<p>If corn derived ethanol is worse for the environment than petroleum derived gasoline, the only reasons to use it are economic.  If it&#x27;s cheaper, people will likely use it.  (Nevermind that so-called &quot;biofuels&quot; often command a premium because people think they&#x27;re environmentally friendly!).  However, if biofuels are bad for the environment, electric cars are bad for the environment, and other alternatives are not yet commercially viable, what does that leave?  Well, sadly, it means stop driving so much!  Use public transit. Bike. Walk. Carpool.  Stop throwing irrational hissy fits about pipelines meant for safely transporting petroleum if it&#x27;s the least harmful option that&#x27;s currently available.<p>Hopefully better electrical storage technologies will become available before too long.  Nanomaterials do potentially offer ways to make capacitors powerful enough to eclipse current chemical battery technologies. This is years or decades off into the future unfortunately.  I&#x27;m not saying all this to be a drag, but most people really think battery technology has come a lot further than it actually has.  Gasoline is still pretty darned useful stuff.",1398061696

The last time I tried selling on Craigslist I listed a brand new lamp, unopened in box.  I included all the manufacturer&#x27;s pictures and details (dimensions, weight, ect...).  I received an email the next day from a lady interesting in purchasing it.  She asked if we could make the exchange in a Walmart parking lot (in retrospect, that should have a warning sign).  5 minutes after the agreed upon meeting time I received a text that she was running late but would be there any minute.  15 minutes later she arrived and instead of apologizing for wasting my time by running late she insisted on opening the box before purchasing it.  I refused since I was worried this would lower the value if she chose not to purchase it.  She was being stubborn though so I eventually acquiesced.  At this point I really just wanted to offload the lamp and go home.  Upon inspection she said that she was sorry but wouldn&#x27;t be buying it because it was smaller than she thought it would be, never mind the fact that I included the dimensions in the listing.  As I was about to drive away, she offered me half of the agreed upon price.  Why she suddenly wanted it again despite it being too small I&#x27;ll never know as I immediately sped away.<p>Like you, I have a lot of stuff I&#x27;d like to sell.  What I want: a company to send me pre-labeled and pre-paid shipping containers that I then fill with my stuff and leave on my front porch (safe, rural neighborhood) to be picked up.  Every week or so they pay me until everything is sold - minus a commission so that our interests are aligned to get as much as possible for each item.  I can&#x27;t seem to find a service that makes it that easy though.<p>Oh, and that lamp?  Amusingly, I took the lamp back to Home Depot where I had bought it new 3 years earlier.  I had no receipt and I told them honestly how long ago it was originally purchased.  None the less they offered me a full store credit.  The catch was that they no longer carried that brand of lamp and hadn&#x27;t for over 2 years.  In fact, it had been so long since they last sold the lamp that they didn&#x27;t have pricing information on it in their database.  Since they couldn&#x27;t determine how much I paid, they instead gave me store credit equal to that of a lamp they currently had in stock that we agreed was comparable.

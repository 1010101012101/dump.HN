They aren't even in the same ballpark. and it's ridiculous really - it's the fallacy that ""Just because I don't click and my friends don't click, then no one clicks.""<p>Here's your question re-phrased:<p>Ask YC: Does spam really work?\n	The real question is: When was the last time you were inspired to buy something by spam email?<p>I can't recall any time that has happened to me. I also have a friend who has spent a couple hundred on spam at one point, without really seeing results. With this bit of disappointment in mind, my question is - does spam on the web work?",1210456405

I have been using it and I like the way it records all the comments I make which I can then go back and refer to. However, it feels like we provide them with new customers and we don't get a ton back in return.<p>Anyone implement it or Disqus?",1210456198

186513,comment,186133,186133,0,0,njetx,,,"You really need to work backwards from the value of the customer. If you have something that directly monetises then you can calculate value of a register user and of a visitor. Back out your marketing budget from there.<p>However I am assuming you have a consumer app where it is very hard to calculate the value of a visitor/user. In that case you are looking at viral, social media, SEO and paid ads. Viral works if your product is intrinsically viral product (send to friend doesn't count). Social media works if have rich content (how to's, great photos, recent news). SEO is what you do if you can't do the first two (I know of one of the world's biggest travel social networks who never paid a penny on SEO). The problem with SEO is it takes a lot of time to build up traffic.<p>That brings you to paid advertising. I think paid advertising is great for getting everything kick started but  the business model for paid ads doesn't stack up for free consumer apps. Hope that helps.",1210455921

If you read into the details of the situation it's not as incredible as you might think.<p>People with hyperthymesia tend to obsess over their lives, reinforcing the condition with things like diaries and journals - it appears there is a link to obsessive compulsive disorder.

186508,comment,186434,186434,0,0,xirium,,,"The lack of touchscreen interoperability will be a major limitation which will encourage open source adoption.<p>Unfortunately, current client trends are counter to Microsoft's strategy. Firstly, people are buying laptops rather than desktops. Both are getting cheaper. Secondly, Microsoft follows the classic monopolistic tactic of racheting prices. Successive versions of Microsoft software a typical more expensive despite initial costs already being re-couped. These trends create a situation where the cost of an operating system and pre-installed applications take an increasingly large share of the retail price. This creates a third trend of laptop manufacturers who opt-out of the ""Windows tax"" and only supply units with tailored open source software.<p>In two years, we'll probably have a device which is a mix of laptop, mobile telephone and Nintendo DS. It would be a clamshell design with two 11 inch screens with the bottom one being touch sensitive. You cannot rely on Microsoft to support such a device. Nor would it be viable to include Windows. So, such a device would mostly be used with open source operating systems.<p>This design has already been tried. Unfortunately, it was quite a few years ago and it was a commercial failure. However, since then, the technology has improved, the cost has fallen and the volume of people who only want to run open source software has grown significantly. This would make a similar attempt much more likely to succeed.<p>It is understandable that such a trend would adversely affect Microsoft. Therefore an attempt to steeply discount Windows on limited hardware has two benefits. It creates an artificial divide between premium hardware and almost disposable devices where Windows is viable on both. Secondly, it reduces the inclination for low cost manufacturers to abandon Windows.",1210455133

Google did not build an os or office suite, they built a product in an area where MS was not looking, which is the same play MS ran on IBM. I'm not into business gurus that much but Clayton Christensen codified a lot of how those patterns play out; one of his conclusions was that going directly at an established cash cow of a large company is not a good idea unless you intend to sell.",1210454564

Although things are getting better this is our only option for now.<p>This is from their website:<p>""Does DSL give me a fixed IP address?""<p>""No, at each login a new dynamic IP address will be assigned to you. Your DSL connection will be reset 24 hours after the last login and a 60 min idle timeout has been implemented.""<p>And the way that they implement uncapped/ capped connection is by separating them in to IP address blocks. So your DSL connection is forcefully disconnected every 24 hours, when you reconnect you get a new IP address and dependent on your usage limit you'll be capped or uncapped. (When you're capped you don't receive any data).<p>I hope that helps to clear up your statement about our bandwidth limits not been enforced daily.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telkom_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telkom_</a>(South_Africa)",1210454154

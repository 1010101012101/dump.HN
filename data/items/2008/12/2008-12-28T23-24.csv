The system which predominated in the 50's of spending your entire career working for a big corporation and then living off of a retirement pension seems to be faltering.  The auto industry is just one example...<p>To me, programming offers a challenging, generally fun activity with more potential for innovation than nearly any other ""job.""  I didn't get into software to be the modern day equivalent of an assembly line worker.  Though I can sympathize to some extent with the position of the ""rank and file"" engineers (i.e. that many software engineering jobs are a means of putting food on the table), I'm also optimistic that the opportunity to build great things finds those who have a desire to do so.",1230508005

I am a bit over 30 now and I've only become better, <i>as long as I'm motivated</i> (it was easier to stay motivated when I was younger). It seems to me that as long as you don't stop learning, you will only get better, and the experience of people like Steve Yegge seems to confirm it.<p>I don't understand the whining about the workplaces either. At the end of the day, what makes Google a great place to work: the free soda and perks or the options to work on interesting things? If you choose the former, probably you are not really wired to enjoy programming as much as some of us are.",1230507924

412331,comment,411525,412171,0,0,qaexl,,,"""... shows that for a long time Western writers have been overestimating the number of inhabitants of China who are actually conversant in Mandarin. The lower than expected percentage of Chinese persons who can understand one another in Mandarin illustrates how little provision of primary education, broadcasting, or telephony has reached the hinterlands of China. The comparable percentage in Taiwan, which a generation ago had a much lower percentage of families with any family heritage of speaking Mandarin, is much higher, a sign of Taiwan's greater success in providing education and mass communications to all inhabitants.""<p>I think the more interesting question is how the Chinese were able to hold together a culture as diverse as having many separate, unintelligable dialects, yet still live with the popular myth that they ""speak Chinese"".<p>Personally, having these ideograms isn't a bad thing. It makes it harder for me to type in Chinese. However, the way the language is setup has allowed me to think along different lines I would not have had, if I only knew English.<p>A different line of thought: our decendents may look back and say that the Internet had changed things profoundly, but not for the reasons we think of it now. The legacy may well end up being the ubiquitous use of the Unicode standard.",1230507100

Looks like just a reset with ""sensible"" styles that look terrible in my browser and don't seem like anything I'd use myself.  Why not make use of the ""C"" in CSS and separate ""reset.css"" and ""sensible.css"", or at least declare the styles twice to distinguish between removing styles vs. adding styles?  I don't get mixing the two.<p>Oh, and putting Arial before Helvetica is just shameful.  Not just because Arial is shameful, but because every system that has Helvetica (i.e. Macs, some Windows users) also has Arial.  So as written, Helvetica will never be seen.  Likewise for Courier New vs. Courier, or Times New Roman vs. Times.  It's nice to declare fonts that look best on each platform, but only if it actually <i>works</i>.",1230507072

412318,comment,411525,411943,0,0,qaexl,,,"I've been recently studying more ancient Chinese history and the game of Weiqi (Go, as it is known in the US). Weiqi is a good way to understand the sociopolitical strategies of China. In Weiqi, it is often easier to surround and assimilate (embrace and extend) than it is to invade and conquer. If there is a grand strategy of the current political heads of China, it is to make China the pivot point of the world. America goes forth and spread democracy; I think the Chinese prefers to get other countries to orbits around them, the way the earth orbits inside the sun's gravity well.<p>An observation of the inventiveness of the (Han) Chinese I think is best written by Neal Stephenson in his essay published in Wired Magazine in 1994: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.02/mao.bell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.02/mao.bell.html</a><p>""This article is the result of a two-week trip to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Shanghai during September '93, during which I tried to get some sense of how the Chinese perceived the influence of technology - particularly digital technology - on their culture.<p>The answer is that this issue hasn't occurred to the Chinese yet, and probably never will, because it basically stems from a Western, post-Enlightenment perspective. Going to China and asking people about the Hacker Ethic is like going to Peoria and talking to the folks down at Ned's Feed & Grain about Taoism. The hacking part comes to them easily enough - China is, in a sense, a nation of analog hackers quickly entering the digital realm. But I didn't see any urge to draw profound, cosmic conclusions from the act of messing around with technology. """,1230506467

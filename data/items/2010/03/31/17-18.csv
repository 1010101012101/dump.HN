The downside is that most people don't even know that this exists, so when doing an international based system, you have a filter based on the country they user is based in and automatically apply any codes needed.  Just strip everything out of the field that isn't a number and prepend the country code if the region doesn't normally include it.  That means that 210-555-1212 would become 12105551212 for a U.S. number and 21-555-1212 would become 55215551212 for a Brazil number.",1270058391

With analog signals, you can always get higher fidelity by upgrading components (until something else becomes the bottleneck). With digital, there are gradients of ""wrong"" but there is only one ""right."" Once you hit the threshold of bits not being flipped, getting more expensive and higher-quality components will not get you better-sounding playback. A digital cable can achieve literally perfect playback. Analog cannot reach perfection, which means it's always possible to improve.<p>I'm not an electrical engineer so I don't know what the threshold of perfection is, but if the consumer reports can't tell the fancy cable apart from the Radio Shack equivalent of two-buck chuck, I'm not going to worry about it.<p>On an unrelated note: this is a listing on amazon for 6 feet of digital audio cable for over a thousand dollars.

They're behind corporate or government networks and that's all they have and are allowed to have, for a variety of reasons-some legitimate, some not. Others are people who are far less web/tech/computer savvy and wouldn't know how to upgrade, wouldn't know, or even care why they should. You can and should try to educate your users, but there will always be some that just don't get it and others that just don't care, and plenty that are helpless to do anything about it anyway.<p>Here's how we handle IE6 support: We have several large apps that are used by a lot of corporate/government offices. They have to fully work in IE6, no questions asked, that's just non-negotiable. At each new phase of development, we thoroughly test in IE6 before moving on to make sure things work. After doing this enough, you start to learn what will work and what won't and IE6 support becomes easier over time, and since the codebase is built with IE6 in mind from the beginning, it's not so bad, most of the time.<p>We have another large app that's not as restricted in where and how it has to work. It has a public-facing side and an admin interface. The public-facing side works fully in IE6 in terms of function. There may be a few pixels difference here and there in visuals, but as long as it still looks good and functions properly, we don't stress it if it's not pixel-perfect. The admin side is meant for users who are more tech savvy and the percentage of IE6 users is very low. What we do in that instance, and this is pretty much our standard aproach when IE6 support isn't essential, is make all of the core functionality of the app work with IE6 and then disable the bells and whistles that give the app additional functionality that adds convenience. We then let the user know that upgrading their browser will give them access to this additional functionality and make their user experience better. Hopefully, they choose to upgrade, but if they don't or can't, they can still do everything the app is designed to do. It just won't be as pleasant/intuitive/seamless of an experience.<p>As much as I hate IE6, I hate the idea of giving its users the finger and not allowing them to browse/use my app/site as best as their antiquated browser will allow them to even more.",1270055100

LCF — or Logic for Computable Functions — was a reasoning tool that helped programmers to prove that their programs were correct. ML was a new programming language whose features are widely used in modern computer languages, <i>including Microsoft’s groundbreaking new language F Sharp. Millions of computers all over the world will use this language when they are next upgraded by Microsoft.</i> CCS was a pioneering, simple algebraic approach to describing how concurrent processes interact. It has been widely used in hardware verification.""<p>Not sure that an obit is normally the place for a product placement.",1270055097

If you were just to stop and think for a second, I bet you'd see how ridiculous it is.<p>LaTeX is more difficult than Word by about a dozen aspects. And here's a random list off the top of my head.<p>1) It's more difficult to see how what you're typing will look like.<p>2) It's more difficult to decide which one to download and install (there's just one Word).<p>3) TeX comes with its own set and philosophy of fonts that you have to learn, understand, remember and debug. Word uses the same fonts that come with the OS.<p>4) You need to learn what the hell ""DVI files"" are and what to do with them. Word prints to your printer or saves in a number of familiar formats in addition to its proprietary ones.<p>5) Word makes it easy to include a diagram, a drawing, a photo. TeX has different competing ""drawing packages"", all arcane, all hard to learn and use, all have caused many a dissertation author to curse in despair.<p>6) You're a journalist or a writer under contract or a translator. You need to know how many words you've written. Word can tell you immediately. TeX? Go online, look for a tool or a script, there's half a dozen, none standard, most probably obsolete or not maintained anymore.<p>7) Because Word is WYSIWYG, quick iteration is possible: try something, see it's not working, immediately back out and try something else. TeX's cycle is slow and breaks the flow of thought.<p>8) Word has hierarchical menus, context menus and tooltips, together they make it relatively easy to find some functionality if you don't remember the exact keystroke, command or menu item. Most of the times, you know where to look and quickly scan a dialog box to find what you need. In TeX, you need to remember dozens of commands, or tediously search for them in docs or online.<p>9) It's rare/difficult to do a local change in Word that screws up an entire page or document; it's trivial to do so in TeX.<p>10) When you screw something up in Word, you see what went wrong and can quickly undo it. When you screw something up in TeX, you're bombarded with arcane error messages.<p>11) You hardly ever need to fix up a Word installation or understand the hierarchy of its directories, include files, etc.<p>12) Word trivially exports to HTML, the great universal language of our times.",1270054875

From the Wikipedia article on caffeine(which cites original research):<p><i>Caffeine tolerance develops very quickly, especially among heavy coffee and energy drink consumers. Complete tolerance to sleep disruption effects of caffeine develops after consuming 400 mg of caffeine 3 times a day for 7 days. Complete tolerance to subjective effects of caffeine was observed to develop after consuming 300 mg 3 times per day for 18 days, and possibly even earlier. In another experiment, complete tolerance of caffeine was observed when the subject consumed 750–1200 mg per day while incomplete tolerance to caffeine has been observed in those that consume more average doses of caffeine.</i><p>For reference, a grande drip coffee from Starbucks has about 330mg caffeine.<p>and on withdrawal:\n<i>Withdrawal symptoms — possibly including headache, irritability, an inability to concentrate, drowsiness, insomnia and pain in the stomach, upper body, and joints — may appear within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of caffeine intake, peak at roughly 48 hours, and usually last from one to five days, representing the time required for the number of adenosine receptors in the brain to revert to ""normal"" levels, uninfluenced by caffeine consumption.</i>",1270054872

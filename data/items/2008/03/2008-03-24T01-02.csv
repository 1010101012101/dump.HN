I just find it funny how we all have witnessed the success of so many different business models, and then for someone to say that only one is possible.",1206323668
144240,comment,144127,144202,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Even with a secretary it would be hard to manage 1,000 e-mails per day, much less 10,000 using the current e-mail clients. This would also be true of outsourcing it to a team of hardworking Estonians, Irish, Indians, or Canadians. Look at electronic discovery techniques (reading e-mail in a lawsuit evidence discovery process) where you may pay dozens of attorneys to sort through e-mail as another limit case of throwing bodies at the problem.",1206323515

144238,comment,144088,144088,0,0,NewWorldOrder,,,"your absolute chance of becoming a millionaire isn't 2/3.  2/3 millionaires are entrepreneurs.  The entrepreneurial route to millions is at least double that of the non-entrepreneurial route (assuming there are no more entrepreneurs than there are non-entrepreneurs  -- a reasonable assumption)...in the example game given at the post, the non-entrepreneurial route is assigned the chance of 1/3 (assuming 1 out 3 non-entrepreneurs are millionaires -- not so reasonable assumption)...so 2/3 is at least double of 1/3.<p>To be clear, if there are 30 millionaires and 3K non-entrepreneurs and 3K entrepreneurs, the entrepreneurial route obviously wouldn't be 2/3, but it will be double that of the non-entrepreneurial route.<p>Excuse the confusion.",1206322925

(root exploits) Also be cautious if you are running some freely available software (such as phpbb). When a security hole  is found, an attacker could deploy code on your machine resulting in a denial of service attack against other internet users, or in worst case, compromising your machine with a root exploit.<p>4) If a security exploit is found , update!

Some we are sensitive to with our eyes, some our nerves detect (infra-red, or ""heat""), some our skin responds to (UV--we tan), and so on.  The wifi frequencies are much different from the 60 Hz overhead power lines that people feared in the past (there is no effect on health).  They are more in line with radio/tv.<p>Seems we would have seen the effect long ago from people living near FM radio transmitters (lots of power there at similar frequencies--compared to low power wifi transmitters).<p><a href=""http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/understand/radiation_topics/emf/wifi.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/understand/radiation_topics/...</a>",1206320944

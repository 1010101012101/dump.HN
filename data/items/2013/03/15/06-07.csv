But the category was not ""smartphone"". They had a dominating lead in the category ""mobile phone with touch UI and great web browser"" from 2007-2010. Nobody cared about Symbian anymore after the presentation of the iPhone. That category was left to die. The iPhone became the new state of the art for smartphone.<p>Apple lost the lead around 2011 however due to the unwillingness to provide more than one model or innovate faster. Android was more flexible and could address more users.<p>Now it may well be that Apple doesn't care about this at all. But please do not make arguments how technically Apple never led in the smartphone market.",1363330778

Just this week alone there were several rules I broke that could have lead to my license being suspended, but because the city is so crowded, the probability of being caught for breaking rules (such as going around a tram pedestrian refuge, or forcing the yellow light) is close to zero, unless you end up in an accident.<p>There is a difference however in what is <i>legal</i> to do and what you can get away with. Our current legislation systems tends to make criminals out of all of us. The example I just gave is a bad one too, because I know exactly what rules I'm breaking and I know exactly the outcome if I get caught, whereas with infringing patents you never know exactly what patents you infringe, or the outcome of that.<p>There's also the issue of selective enforcement. The law should be the same for everybody, otherwise if everybody is a criminal by default, the law gets used to suppress people that are undesirable.<p>It doesn't really matter if Monsanto never sued anyone for using their patented crops without the usage of the Roundup herbicide.

They mention a few times in the post that one of the ways they procrastinate is to ""try a new recipe"" or ""watch a documentary"". For me, I procrastinate from <i>cooking</i> by programming, because programming is much mor enjoyable to me. Heck, I even enjoy programming more than most recreational activities. Perhaps the OP should pursue the culinary arts, or become a documenteur, or an expert on the psychology of procrastination given how long and in-depth this post is. Seriously, it's a 2600 word article that I have no doubt the author wrote instead of doing something else they were ""supposed to be doing"". But should they really be doing it, or feeling guilty for not?<p>I say this because I spent 7 years in college bouncing from degree to degree, finally settling on physics of all things, not because I had a burning passion for physics but because my father had always held it in such high regard and had such high expectations for me. Every day was a struggle against procrastination. It's funny because I wrote countless self-addressed pieces like the OP's lamenting my battle with procrastination and what to do about it; I even kept track of the different strategies I'd employ, which all inevitably failed.<p>Turns out it wasn't that I was broken in some way and it wasn't a problem I could fix. I just didn't want professional physicist, and although I did graduate (thanks grade inflation!) I haven't so much as touched a Lorentz transformation or Feynman graph since. I wanted to build things, not discover things, and programming rubbed me in all the right ways. I now have the complete opposite problem the OP has; I work too much, am very productive, and it frankly it affects my liesure life. I haven't finished a video game in years.<p>I'll close with one last bit of wisdom I learned from my father. No matter what my Dad does for the day, whether it was ten important things or 1 seemingly trivial thing, he always focuses on the stuff he got done rather than dwell on the stuff that got neglected. Now I always make sure to do at least one thing I can look back on about which I can say confidently made the day worth it. It's easy to lose perspective.

It's a simple list structure how expressive can it get.<p>First understand the difference between a statement and an expression. I had a lot of procedural code hangover and it took me sometime to understand that difference.<p>Lisp limits your expressive ability by a simple list structure, all you have is the ability to nest expressions. So, Lisp invariably lets you break down your ideas into small expressions. So when you read code, just look the operator at the beginning of each sub expression and you will understand the code.  Trust me, its as simple as that. It sounds very easy but it took me over 6 months to understand that.<p>You might argue lisp is the most expressive language ever.  Its true, but for a beginner who is having trouble reading lisp code..  you should look at just the first element of a expression and its nested expression and you will get the idea.",1363328409

5379432,comment,5379345,5379345,3,0,Glyptodon,,,"This was interesting, but I think there's another dimension to it. It's not merely that ag created a property incentive to promote monogamy - there's also a huge change in terms of shared experience and the creation of the idea of class.<p>In a tribe there's very a much a shared culture with shared culture and shared social bonds, while in the modern world there's an endless fractal of subcultures and individualism. And the more educated you are, the smaller the people here share enough of a permutation of culture to feel similar is.<p>I think this somewhat explains why divorce rates are higher for the less educated - having more in common it's easier for there to be widespread understanding and shared culture, which in turn sets a lower bar (or creates a higher probability) that people will be able to functionally bond with each other.<p>Conversely, going to college narrows the pool of people who have enough shared tribal characteristics to be a part of the comfort zone, and it increases even further when people express their tendencies to want relationships with people who share interests/traits/experiences/educational choices.<p>In a tribe every shared the same experiences. Likewise, nearly everyone shares similar K-12 experiences. So within these cohorts there would naturally be a high replacability, which should mean monogamy ought to become less valued.<p>On the other hand, people who go to college and matriculate through to different careers are basically funneling themselves into situations where there are fewer people with enough shared experiences to be a part of the tribe, making the value of an individual relationship increase.<p>TLDR: The less mainstream someone is, the more they should have an incentive to value an individual relationship. Thus the more uniform and cohesive the social group, the less value is likely placed on an individual relationship. Hence we can blame not just property rights, but the fact that civilization and agriculture destroy shared experience compared to hunter/gatherer tribes. This can also explain lower divorce rates among the more educated or uniquely experienced as compared to typical high school graduates.",1363328119

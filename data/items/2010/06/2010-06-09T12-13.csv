Often the ability of outsourcing vendors ability to help you hinges upon the answers to those two questions. If youre solving either - an algorithmically hard problem or a problem that requires iterative refinement, then you might have some valid reasons not to outsource. Otherwise having additional manpower available when needed might actually be a good thing.",1276088246

One of the major complaints for our company (not a startup) was that our bug fixing cycles were too slow and customer wanted faster service packs/ releases. Outsourcing the bug fixing process gave very good results. A strict code review process was the biggest investment from the on-site team (sr. devs would take time daily to review the changes done by offshore team).",1276088193

Apparently they solved the problem of creating the illusion, but were ultimately thwarted by the problem of what to do with the thousands of gallons of water.

Creating a coroutine can be done in a couple of instructions (allocate a new stack and set the top of the stack to the code of the coroutine), and yielding is also just a few instructions (mov a new stack pointer and return).<p>Essentially if you view coroutines and continuations as data structures then continuations are a functional / non destructive version of coroutines, and like other functional data structures they are slower.<p>I don't know how Ruby fibers are implemented but they seem to have coroutine semantics, so they are probably very efficient as well.<p>Adapting a callback library to coroutines is very simple. You have a user coroutine that runs the user code, and you have a system coroutine that manages the resource that calls you back when it's ready (e.g. downloading a web page). When the user code requests something from the resource it yields to the system coroutine. When the system has the response ready the system yields to the user code again.<p>This is nearly the same for continuations, the difference is that yielding involves copying the stack of the continuation that is yielded to.",1276085728

A vector graphic is going to be much smaller for icons and other non-photo images.  The downside is that instead of just shoving some bits onto the page, the client has to run a script to tell it what the bits are supposed to be.",1276085137
1416774,comment,1416629,1416629,0,0,bonsaitree,,,"For the shop owner(s), making the economic case for having a card merchant account comes down to several factors:<p>- Size of typical transactions
- Volume of transactions per billing cycle
- % of charge-backs per billing cycle
- Charge-back volume compared to revenue
- Anticipated volume & revenue gains with the additional card buying channel
- Comfort level with dependency on 3rd-party accounting
- Comfort level with 3rd party data mining
- Comfort level with necessary technologies
- Additional management overhead due to accounting and card accouterments<p>Offhand, there are a variety of scenarios, esp. for boutique businesses in urban environments with ready access to ATMs, where a cash-only policy makes good business sense.",1276085061

Done.<p>Also the minimum is against Visa's merchant agreement. You can report them to visa to get that changed. I was at a pub once that said £10 minimum, but just before I was going to argue he said he would charge it up for £10 and give me the change. Fair enough I suppose.",1276085060

We perceive time as time and space as space. The concept of spacetime does not help us understand or visualize higher dimensional spaces at all. It only confuses the issue, which is exactly the original complaint against the video this whole discussion is about.<p>Edit: One more example: Can you visualize the difference between a 3D cube moving in time, and a 4D cube moving in the 4th dimension? If you project the 4D cube down to 3D, it will look like a double cube that twists itself inside and out, but the 3D cube moving in time will just look like a 3D cube.

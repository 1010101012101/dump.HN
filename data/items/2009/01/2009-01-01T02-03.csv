The one constant of our industry is that language platforms seem to have a 5-9 year popularity-span. Google pushes Python, Java eclipsed C++ for a huge portion of the market, C++ has now supplanted C in many places. (Please note that I know there are outliers in this and it's not an absolute rule! Objective-C, for example, hasn't gone away.)<p>I enjoy new problems and domains too. It's great to dive into a new subject, and often very valuable. But the reason people say, ""Learn a new language ever <time increment>"" is because you're not just tackling a new domain, you're talking a new way of understanding domains. This kind of meta-exercise is invaluable, in my opinion.",1230778714

Some things fall under (questionably enforceable) non-competes, and some things don't.

One of them has now become a semi-star on the Jazz scene - but it didn't come cheap. On a normal day he would get up at eight, go to school, then head straight for some training session when he finished. After a quick dinner he would go out and play one or two jobs. On weekends he played 4 or 5 jobs and did some jam sessions or did recordings.<p>Being a jazz musician may sound like a cozy job, but to get anywhere it takes an 80 hour work week.",1230778229

The ""default"" thing for them is to climb the corporate ladder.<p>pg talked about this in his ""high-res society"": <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/highres.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/highres.html</a><p>In a way I could see where this idea comes from: if you lack a college degree (or have one but not from a top-tier school and not with top grades) you're still locked out of some opportunities. The only way to a high ranking position in some companies is to enter as a ""college hire"" and advanced through the ranks (senior positions are seldom open to outside applicants and there is fear that an experienced applicant will be bored/unmotivated at a junior or entry-level position; academic record is seen as the ""best"" indication of potential success for a junior applicant). So for those without a college education, often the only way to a senior position is through start-ups.<p>What doesn't follow - any more - is that for those with an education the only way to a senior position is through a big company. It's still a way (there are lots of smart people at places such as Google, IBM, Amazon, Yahoo), but no longer the only reliable option. Even those at big companies no longer stay with the same big company: ""job-hopping"" is pretty common for advancement (sometimes for better, sometimes for worse - seeing less competent employees but with higher salaries due to greater negotiating leverage - can be de-motivating for employees who are uninterested in job hopping themselves).<p>The only way that this assumption is still slightly true is that only big companies offer the chance to work on certain classes of problems that start-ups can not tackle - but here's hope that this will change (and there are indication it is changing).",1230775840

2209012,comment,2208056,2208938,0,0,btilly,,,"My reference was what I was informed was the law by multiple lawyers when I lived in New York.  It is possible that I misunderstood or the rules have changed in the last decade, but I am pretty sure neither is the case.  Still you should confirm this with a qualified attorney before accepting what I say as being absolutely true.<p>More precisely I was told that New York recognizes 3 types of employee relationships.  They are hourly, contractor, and professional employee.  The first two are obvious.  You are aware if you have to punch in on a clock, or are a contractor.  The default for software development is therefore the third.<p>As a professional employee there are no set place or hours for your employment.  (That is why you don't get overtime.)  Therefore anything that you do that could possibly relate to your employment is by default assumed to be a work for hire that took place during the course of your employment.  There are admittedly some complications there.  If a programmer writes a novel, that's going to not be a work for hire.  If a programmer writes a program, that's likely going to be a work for hire.  But there are gray areas.  For instance a VB programmer by day who works a C device driver for Linux by night <i>might</i> have a case that their side project doesn't relate to their employment.<p>But just in case, virtually every New York company makes sure that employees sign contracts that clarifies any possible ambiguity..in favor of the employer.  So the reality is that if you live in New York, you can't assume that you own your side project.<p>Incidentally this is the reason that the FSF (which is very careful on intellectual property) requires that they get copyright assignment both from contributers and from the contributers' employers.  Because they don't want to get into a situation where they think they have copyright, but someone else has a legal claim to copyright that code.",1297475698

It's very easy, even in the hard sciences, to get by without doing any real work and by actually learning very little in the class. If you're really good and put lots of work and interest in the class, you will get an A; but so will a bunch of other people whose main qualification is knowing how to put pressure on the teacher and the TA. If someone comes during office hours, spends enough time, and asks the right sequence of questions, you are practically bound by the rules and the incentives to do 90% of their homework for them. Only exams are relatively less corrupted, but even those are going down the drain as a rigorous method of evaluation (fake learning disabilities, very easy problems, low proportion in overall grade etc.).",1297475053

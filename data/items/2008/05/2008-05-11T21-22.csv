Facebook's revenues = pageviews / 1000 * cpm. Nothing about the effectiveness of Adsense says Facebook can't be a thriving business.",1210542998

So you would be much better off seeking out experts.<p>That being said, check out <a href=""http://www.softwareceo.com/attachments/softwareceo/com021908.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.softwareceo.com/attachments/softwareceo/com021908...</a><p>Unless you can do something like Google does in not giving out guidance, which seems highly doubtful, the bottom line benchmark seems to be a) a revenue threshold and then b) being able to give decent guidance about future numbers on a quarterly basis.  I've always thought the revenue threshold was around 100M, but that link argues it can be smaller for software companies in the right situation.",1210542592

187057,comment,187015,187035,0,0,abstractwater,,,"Before moving to Silicon Valley 5 years ago, I grew up and worked in Italy and I confirm those numbers.  The only employment available in Italy right now is basically temp contracting paid a fraction of the relative full time position, with no job security.  These ""precarious"" employees are often Master's Degree holders forced to accept those shitty jobs because, well, they are the only one available -- either that or leave the country, as many do.  It you're thinking ""why don't those smart people start a business then?"", suffice it to say the government makes it extremely complicated.  There's a lot of bureaucracy involved that is a big deterrent for many.",1210542572

187054,comment,186961,186992,0,0,yariv,,,"I really like Xobni too. I use it at work and it does make Outlook much better -- primary because of the better search and threaded conversations (the social networking and analytics features are less useful for me, though).<p>However, I think Xobni's market is largely hypothetical, and it's not clear how Xobni can make money. The fact that I have a credit card doesn't mean I will use it in Xobni, especially because the app is free and it already solves my Outlook problems.<p>(Btw, I would be happy to pay $20 for Xobni if they charged me for it :) )",1210542379

This is why their salaries are pretty good compared to the minions below them.<p>$50k/yr is a good salary on almost any part of the planet. It's the median personal salary in the United Kingdom, for instance.",1210542227

But as soon as they mentioned someone 24 years old - part of the ""echo"" generation who, in general, can expect the exact opposite - I decided they were just making shit up.",1210542034

""Finally, I was able to trade my independence for the savings,"" he said while waiting for the bus.<p>I leave my city apartment at 720, walk briskly to the train station (3/4 mile), take the 737 train, arrive in the suburbs where I work by 830ish, take the bus, arrive at work just before 9. Why? Because I wanted to escape the suburbs and my cube and experience life in the city and keep my decent software job. Because I choose to outsource commuting to my local public transportation authority.<p>Most people think I'm insane to spend three to four hours a day commuting. I usually don't bother to mention it to my friends who live and work in the city. Taking public transportation, your life is driven by the schedule - which is fine since most workdays are pretty structured. The more I use public transportation, the cheaper it is (unlimited use monthly pass)<p>I am writing this to explain that it doesn't matter how illogical your commute is - you can always (emotionally) justify it (as with most things in life)",1210540713

187038,comment,186925,186925,0,0,walterk,,,"Ideas can indeed be worth a lot, and I'm tired of this macho entrepreneurial culture which tries to disregard their value as a way of motivating better execution.  If you have to trick yourself into believing that ideas aren't worth much to properly assess the value of execution, you're just telling yourself one more lie than you really need.<p>As it happens, we live in a time where there are so many (potentially) good ideas that there isn't enough time or talent for us to work on them all.  But good startup ideas aren't like dollar bills, where the more you have of them, the less each of them is worth.  Nor are they like most goods whose marginal utility decreases with consumption.  We call them ""ideas"" as a way of lumping what they are together, but each is unique and arises from the perception of very different needs/pains/wants in the world.  They don't lose value because many other similarly worthy ideas exist.",1210540511

You can spend a week travelling around Europe, collect a few quotes from people who feel like whining about their financial situation, throw in a few fairly-meaningless numbers (Spain's government cut its growth forecast slightly!) and call it an article.<p>One interesting fact though: he had trouble finding a German with much to complain about. The best he could do was some guy on a perfectly reasonable salary of 2700 a month (about $US50K a year) in Berlin who admits his money is okay but isn't doing what he ""dreamed"" of doing.

Come check it out."" and because youve spent so much time talking to them, as a friend would, they will say ""Oh, awesome, let me check it out and tell you what I think.""<p>And that feedback?

Historically no company has ever gotten to be the size of MSFT, or AAPL or any other multibillion dollar company without management.  I don't know for sure the reason, but would guess that someone has to answer to shareholders and they must organize various people with conflicting opinions, ideas and motivations to accomplish a single goal.<p><i>Do companies really go down in flames if no one is there to try and measure, through various ineffective ways, the quality of other people's work (often in a field they don't even understand)?</i><p>I dont think so, but I would guess that much of the effort to measure etc. is put in place by HR consultants in at least some part to avoid discrimination lawsuits and to make sure employees are being treated at least somewhat fairly.<p><i>Would a bunch of engineers really sit there doing nothing if they didn't have a manager to report to? Is said manager more apt at taking decisions than they are?</i><p>I can confidently say yes to this.  Not just engineers, but everyone.  If there was no structure, but you had to get a lot done, people would avoid work, work on their own side projects etc.  (side projects are not good for the company if they are a new startup that wont include the company).<p>[] Someone mentioned valve below, they have a system, it just looks flat.

This means that researchers collect data from a number of disparate sources and attempt to make sense of it. The problem is that it is very hard to tease out confounding variables.<p>So I don't put much stock in this type of study. They have their value, but I wouldn't make any life decisions off of them. Their primary purpose is to help formulate hypotheses that can be tested experimentally.<p>When it comes to experimental tests, the lipid hypothesis has been shown to be wrong over and over.

But you miss what Steve Jobs did, he <i>made them happen.</i> Which is to say that he may have been claiming credit left and right but he looked (from the outside) to be fearless in his drive to get the next product done and shipping. A really fascinating story in WSJ today about Nokia and their smart phone dreams in <i>2007</i> [1]. Which if you read the article has this quote:<p><i>""If only they had been landed in products,"" Mr. Elop said of the company's inventions in a recent interview, ""I think Nokia would have been in a different place.""</i><p>And that is so key. To go to production requires a crap ton of work, there are manuals, there are repair strategies, there are warranty kits, there are certifications and approvals, there is testing and injection molding tooling. The list seems nearly endless. Then once you ship the product (unless you're HP apparently :-) you commit to supporting it for 2, 3 even 5 years. That is a Big Deal(tm) and so making that commitment requires Big Decisions.<p>Now when you are small its easy, you have to ship product to survive and you don't care that you're committing to 5 years of long term support if you're just happy if you still exist in five years. But if you're a big name and a big company you see that investment meaning you <i>can't</i> invest in something else. And if you don't passionately and honestly believe that what is being proposed is or can be the next big thing, you don't dare ship it and miss the real big thing.<p>Clayton did a much better job than I at describing the Innovator's Dilemma but the essence of what he speaks about is the will to ship. Steve had that in spades and its a rare gift. It can work against you too (see Adam Osborne who announced but shipped late the Osborne Executive as the HBR exemplar of killing yourself).<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304388004577531002591315494.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405270230438800457753...</a>",1342729033

I plan to encompass the industry as a whole and hope to create unity for the community. Really looking for some help in terms of how to go about developing my idea. I do have much experience with outsourcing and have run www.CraigslistDesign.com as a successful design and web development company for basic websites.<p>Would really apprecaite help on how to go about building the V1 of my project.

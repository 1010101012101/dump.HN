So having a look at the code and fixing the crappy portion will be more productive than throwing away the whole implementation. I think whole rewrite rule is useful when you start working on a new technology... but if you are using a stack for considerable amount of time, then refactoring is the way to improve the code quality.",1233068008

Looking at my own data that I consider important, many photos I've taken of my family exist on probably dozens of machines around the world belonging to relatives and friends. Of course this also happened in the pre-digital age, but I don't think to the same extent.<p>2. It's easier to create digital content in the first place, so there will be more of it. How many photos were snapped during the construction of, say, Taipei 101 as compared to the construction of the Empire State building? I don't know, but I'd guess orders of magnitude more.

It was rolled out about a year ago and is now primarily used as a replacement for storing files. I started playing around with it and discovered, to my delight, that there's a built-in wiki feature.<p>There's a huge place for it in our daily operations. It could save thousands of hours in the long run if we got only a few people to contribute. The problem is that second part: How do you get people to contribute?<p>Here's my strategy:<p>1. Privately create lots of stubs beforehand along with an intelligent structure for linking them together. Also add tons of how-to articles (because for non-technies, obvious isn't so obvious)<p>2. Add pages that show how people could actually benefit from it<p>3. Brief our management, stressing the benefits, and ask for them to push it within their organizations<p>4. If all goes well, people will slowly start adding information. If even 5% of the employees contribute, it will quickly reach a tipping point and then explode in popularity.<p>5. I'll continue to add and edit articles on a daily basis for the next few months regardless of the initial reaction<p>6. Gradually make it the go-to point for certain types of information, forcing people to use it and see how useful it can be<p>I'm at step #2 right now. I'll have the opportunity to brief the management in about three weeks.<p>Also, I'm going to call it a ""collaborative notebook"" as that encompasses how people can benefit from it much more than calling it a wiki or knowledge base.<p>The thing I've found is that even just telling people what I'm doing in basic terms is unclear. They hear ""wiki"" and go ""wiki wiki wiki"" and then nod their heads when I'm explaining things to them.<p>What I've realized is that its not their fault if they don't understand what you're doing. Its your fault for not explaining it to them in a way that makes it clear.<p>We'll see what happens... wish me luck.",1233065846
452106,comment,451866,451866,0,0,artlogic,,,"I have seen a great deal of wiki-phobia, even among so called techies.  No matter how many wikis I deploy, this inevitably occurs.  Here's my take on the problem:<p>- Wikis require a heroic effort to keep organized.  Most people, when faced with creating a new category, or even a new page would rather send an e-mail and forget it.  The fact that you have to not only post something, but also decide where it belongs makes the job of posting feel much harder.  ""You mean I have to categorize my content before I post?""<p>- Wikis require more cognitive effort on the part of the poster.  With e-mail or a message board, you can essentially dump your brain and hit send.  With a wiki, you have to integrate your post, not only into the organization, as I mentioned above, but also into an existing post(s).  ""You mean I have to read and understand other content before I post?""<p>- Most wiki markup is based on the ideas behind the semantic web and should remain readable and understandable even in markup mode - unfortunately, people don't like to cede control of the way their document looks.  I have seen non-techies spend hours jumping through HTML/WYSIWYG hoops simply to achieve a particular look - not realizing the nightmare of editing such a page (think word generated HTML pasted into the page).  ""You mean I have to sacrifice my format before I post?""<p>- Finally most wiki software doesn't have a easy to use e-mail notification system.  Many times you have to manually ""watch"" a page instead of just watching the whole wiki or a whole category.  When you do get an update e-mail - you have to actually go to the wiki - no hitting reply - this again interrupts cognitive flow for a lot of folks.  ""You mean I have to keep track of all the changes myself?""<p>I love wikis, and certainly think that they can increase productivity - but they require a greater cognitive effort on the part of the poster, and a lot of folks are unable to make the short term sacrifices to achieve the long term gain a wiki can offer.",1233065812

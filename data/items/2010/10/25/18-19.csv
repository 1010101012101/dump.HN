You could go to the course listings of Universities you might like to recruit from and go after graduates from those programs.<p>With one decent CS school that I am aware of, the University of Maryland used to require (until last semester or so) all CS graduates to take two lower level classes which are taught in C (with some asm). Now it is just one course. I don't know whether or not students enjoyed it, though I think it is unfortunate that they are dropping one of the two courses (actually combining both into one course.)<p>I think part of why there is this move away from C is some students (rightfully) complain that they may never need to explicitly use it, and Universities figure they can teach the concepts with other languages. I believe that lower level languages should be taught, but I understand why not everyone agrees with me.",1288033172

1831067,comment,1830063,1830063,0,0,rufugee,,,"I just returned to Rails after a brief stint with Django. I was working on a stackoverflow-ish site and wanted to make use of an existing OS project if possible. Django has OSQA, and Rails has Shapado. Shapado would've naturally been the better choice for me, but they use MongoDB and at the time I started the project, I questioned the wisdom of that decision. Learning Django (since I already know python) and using OSQA seemed like the better option, as it would allow me to use my beloved PostgreSQL.<p>Bias warning...I've used Rails for far too long now, so it's very familiar to me and I'm comfortable with it. That said, here's the heavily opinionated and subjective reasons why I'm back:<p>* urls.py - the python regular expression syntax makes your route definitions very ugly as they grow. I find Rails' route DSL much more intuitive.<p>* Lack of model-level validation - OSQA uses Form objects to validate models rather than letting the models validate themselves (as Rails does). In OSQA, the Form objects are rather heavily bound to the UI interaction, so if you need to create models outside of the web app itself (I did) it gets painful. I kept having to hack these form objects to get them to validate properly. I've been told that Django now provides model-level validation, but OSQA doesn't use them (for now).<p>* ORM - I find ActiveRecord to be a much cleaner and intuitive ORM.<p>* Django's template language - I don't work with designers, so I don't need to be hobbled by a template language that is limited by design. I know you can use other template engines, but I was working with what OSQA provided, so I was stuck.<p>* Community - the Rails community in general is more active.<p>* Language preference - at the end of the day, Ruby just feels more natural and clean to me. You could attribute this to familiarity, but I actually knew python long before I knew ruby. I do like python, but tend to ""think"" in ruby.<p>I re-assessed my progress after a month and realized I was just not reaching the same level of productivity I was used to. I decided to switch course and learn MongoDB, which was probably the decision I should've made to begin with, and my productivity instantly improved. I was able to move the features I'd created in Django over within a few nights of focused effort, and I couldn't be happier with Shapado (and, surprisingly, mongodb).<p>This is simply my experience. If it were a completely new project, my experience might've been different. YMMV.",1288032870

It was fine and I'm glad I did it, but I can't say I would call it ""fun"". There were a few points that I found painful. The django admin is customizable and for certain types of apps, it works well. But I wanted my clients to use it to manage data in a legacy database. The inspectdb command was cool and generated models for me along with some data management forms. However, getting the forms to work in ways that matched the workflow of my clients was difficult. I found myself wanting to do things like a ""reverse"" inline -- there were several things that I couldn't figure out and StackOverflow searches didn't reveal good solutions. On my next django project, I decided not to use the admin because it took me longer to figure out how to customize it then it did to just use ModelForms outside of the admin. I haven't found many of the contrib apps to be all that useful or flexible.<p>And for reporting, some of the more complicated queries just didn't work well with the ORM, and I found myself doing ugly things to avoid writing SQL (I know Django doesn't prevent you from writing raw SQL).<p>I just didn't get the same ""fun"" feeling I did when I first developed a Rails app, first grabbed a Vimeo API or flickr gem off of Github, and first pushed it up to Heroku and saw it magically work.

Sort of like Android is built on top of Linux and Java, except less extreme, or what HTC and other handset makers are doing on top of Android. And on the more extreme example, one could argue Apple did the same with BSD and Mach.<p>If the platform is commoditized, it's relatively ""easy"" for companies to build a new personality in the way they think will add value. Canonical's great push forward was and is realizing that one of the biggest problem with Linux desktop nowadays is UX, and they're trying hard to fix that.<p>Personally, I prefer GNOME Shell and I think it's going to rock, especially on tablets. I've tried Unity in Maverick on a few netbooks, just for a few minutes each, since it's default for live install image. I do think it lacks polish and stability and, compared to Moblin/Meego, it's still got a long way to go towards tablet friendlyness.<p>But I love the fact that there are options [0], and that Linux Desktop, aside from never having its year, is a viable platform on which people can experiment and build cool stuff, even if the end users never learn that under this Ubuntu (or Fedora, ...) operating system there's something geeks have holy wars about.<p>[0] Then there is, obviously, KDE, which a great many people use and love.

I do not have time to write a full critique of the article, but every paragraph has at least one sentence that needs to be criticized. For instance:<p>""The policy is designed to push investors and money managers into putting their money into the stock market""<p>Low rates are suppose to encourage investment, but not necessarily investment in the stock market. People may, for instance, want to invest in small software startups. Or maybe someone will decide to invest in a new restaurant, or perhaps they will invest in rehabilitating an old warehouse and turning it into luxury apartments. All of these activities count as investment. All of these activities are encouraged by low rates. The sentence above, that I'm critical of, seems to imply that all investing equals investment in the stock market. This is far from the truth.<p>The opening sentence is especially bad:<p>""The heart of the Federal Reserve's policy to extricate the nation from the lasting grip of a deep recession is in essence a variation of what's known as 'trickle down economics.' ""<p>This statement reveals a surprising lack of any historical awareness. The phrase 'trickle down economics' came in vogue during the early 1980s, to describe the policies of President Reagan. In particular, the big tax cuts of 1982 gave most of the benefits to the wealthy, but the positive effects of the tax cut, though given to the wealthy first, were suppose to eventually 'trickle down' to everyone else. Low rates from the Fed are completely different, and have been around since long before the 1980s. The Fed has used low rates to try to fight every recession since the Fed was created, but no one has ever suggested that these low rates form a kind of 'trickle down' economics.<p>Paul Krugman recently wrote about what we might hope from quantitative easing from the Fed, and also the limits of the Fed power.

There's a large enough of a community for support, plenty of documentation, and alot of the pieces for a website are already written for you and work just fine.<p>Where Django seems to break down is:<p>1. When you upgrade Django, or\n2. When you start customizing Django<p>With just about every release of Django, something breaks. Thankfully, these changes are usually outlined in the release notes, but this often results (from what I've seen) in projects running on fairly old versions of Django because nobody wants to break a working website or app by upgrading their framework. Where I come from (sysadmin turned web dev,) you don't want to run outdated software and you don't want things to break. With Django, you're constantly stuck between a rock and a hard place.<p>Theoretically, you can write all the middleware, decorators, backend authentication modules, etc you want and plug it into Django and have it work flawlessly; however, this isn't always the case in practice. This blog post from one person explains their gripes with extending ,and eventually replacing, Django: <a href=""http://blog.brandonbloom.name/2009/08/dropping-django.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.brandonbloom.name/2009/08/dropping-django.html</a><p>It's important to keep in mind that Django was ultimately developed for news websites. This makes it a great framework for building CMSes, blogs, etc but causes it to break down when you start moving outside of that use case.<p>(Also, FWIW, Django doesn't natively support schema migrations, although their are tools such as ""South"" that implement this functionality.)<p>I think that if you're interested in using a Python-based like framework, you should also consider Pylons and Tornado.",1288030857

I think if Google had taken the high road in this case, they would have had a pretty good chance of coming out on top, but I can't blame them for chickening out (and lying).<p>The reaction to the whole affair demonstrates pretty clearly that most people expect their internet traffic to be private, regardless of how easy it is to intercept, a detail to which they are oblivious. As others have pointed out, some degree of <i>voluntary</i> respect for privacy and property is necessary in a civil society.<p>On the other hand, there are limits on how far we are expected to go to respect those rights. For example, if you have no signs, fences, or intrinsic indicators of ownership on your land, it may not be reasonable to expect people not to trespass. If you leave an old chair on the sidewalk, you probably can't call it theft when someone takes it away. If you are having a loud conversation in a public place, you should expect others to listen in, and so on.<p>There is presently very little consensus on which expectations are reasonable with regard to info tech. There is obviously a huge rift between the technoratti and the layperson, but neither of those subsets has a stable consensus either. The domain is changing too fast for even experts to establish lasting standards.<p>In the particular matter of wireless data, I would hope, ultimately, that nobody will expect data they are <i>broadcasting through the air, for 100 meters in every direction</i> to be private, especially when that supposed privacy could be breached as an unintended side effect of various benign activities, and when the capability to encrypt the data is readily available to everyone.",1288030736

In an elaborate design I understand how they're useful, but for most website mockups I think you can get by without them. You can, for what its worth, lock elements currently with jMockups (see the property inspector), which might be a good middle ground.<p>The editor currently supports most of the standard keyboards you'd expect from an app (Ctrl+S/A/Z/Y) with the main exceptions being Copy and Paste, which I'm working on. I'm open to adding as many more as people find useful. Let me know.<p>Regarding the property inspector: Depending on what direction I take with the width of the canvas, I could add an option for docking it to the left or right of the canvas. What do you think?",1288029972

Gnome panels only looks at one - it's the one that Open Office doesn't use. Makes ""recently used documents"" crap. Fix that. I could probably do that in a week if I knew $1000 was there (out of a project I'm doing, I've learned a fair amount about the Linux desktop, I program c++ and I am available - reply here).<p>But this is the ""100 paper cuts"" thing. I use and curse Gnome daily. I could list ten more if I had any belief there'd be action. $1000 is a week's worth of action if you sell yourself <i>really</i> cheap.<p>Rant 1: If you look at a given ""bug list"" for any large project you'll find a dozen problems posted where the reply is a very curt ""will-not-fix/not-a-bug/your-configuration-is-wrong"". It feels generally snarky and unwelcoming, especially when I'm searching for a solution to the same bug. If someone could figure out protocol that would make bug-reporters <i>feel more welcome</i>, it would really help the process. As developer, I know that, in fact, a lot of things people see really aren't bugs but expected behavior/configuration problems. BUT!, BUT... you have to create an atmosphere of involvement if you want people involved.<p>Proposal/Rant 2: The format for menus in Gnome is the convoluted piece of trash that anyone ever foolish - how freedesktop could possibly publish it as a ""standard"" is beyond me. It needs to be junked and replaced with a simple approach. (And suspect this format is why panels has notable, annoying delay to be displayed even on modern hardware that should show stuff instantly).<p>Proposal/Rant 2: Scribus has a zillion bugs I'd love to see fixed. I have a private list I keep out of frustration. I won't bother pasting it here unless I see more interest. It's more likely that Inkscape will become a viable DTP project through supporting multiple pages than that Scribus will ever stop being a piece of total garbage - because it's really hard fix large, poorly coded project.

1830826,comment,1829672,1830788,0,0,someone_here,,,"The issue is the way that the position of the icons is set by the user. By default, gnome sets the left-most icons to negative numbers as a position, and the right-most icons to some very high numbers. When a user clicks and drags their own applets to the panel, they are considered absolute positions and set their position in pixels.<p>The fix would involve an overhaul of the interface used to add icons to the panel, and it would not fix any existing panel configurations. It would also require at least some sort of an extra step of understanding for the user (Do you mean left justified, right justified, or absolutly positioned?) and some interesting Gnome-panel rendering hacks.<p>This is a lot of work for something that doesn't affect a lot of users, as most users do not customize their panels, and of those that do probably are not changing their resolution often. If someone who wanted to work on user interface hacking worked on other parts, such as improving file system access, preferences configuration, or even login screens, it would be more appreciated by more users.",1288029661

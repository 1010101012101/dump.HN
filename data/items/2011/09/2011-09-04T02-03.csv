2958689,comment,2958528,2958637,9,0,foob,,,"You've ask a couple of very deep questions there.<p><i>Why wouldn't we see this effect on earth, and have taken it into account when determining the strength of earth's own gravity?</i>
We could be observing the impact of this without exactly realizing it. I won't speculate too much on this because I haven't read enough about it but it might make more sense in light of my next answer.<p><i>Would we see this effect with electric fields as well?</i>
We absolutely see this effect with electric fields. In the last century we've grown to understand that in electromagnetism we don't simply deal with isolated electrons and positrons. These particles are actually surrounded with clouds of virtual electrons and photons which have an impact on the field (this is a simplified view but it's enough along the right lines to give you the right impression if you haven't studied physics). When we talk about the field around an electron we take this into account by assuming that all these contributions sum to give us the field that we actually observe. If you want to read more about this then <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory#Renormalization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory#Renormaliz...</a> is a good starting point.<p><i>Could differently oriented electric and gravitational fields compete to orient a given dipole?</i>
Yes, all relevant fields will have an impact on what's happening. I don't want to speculate too much beyond my knowledge though and when it comes to quantum gravity we're already there.<p>I know that this wasn't the deepest contribution but hopefully it will help shed some light to someone...",1315104948

They could use their own DRM'd file format and media player, but that would be broken in a week and have the effect of just releasing copies that somebody would cut the ads out of within 5 minutes of them beng posted.<p>I can't think of any scheme except maybe releasing content through torrents that no one would care about enough to cut the ads out within 5 minutes of it being posted.<p>Wait - maybe intense product placement/integration into television shows? It's inevitable really; with DVRs most people aren't watching traditional commercials anyway. Maybe content producers need to, as a group, get over the artistic squeamishness they have about setting scenes in a Taco Bell...<p>Maybe the answer might be as per jrockway's comment below: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2958478"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2958478</a>. Ditch ads, put up a massive torrent site with killer bandwidth, charge 50 cents a torrent. Entire season for 7 bucks, no risk of prosecution? Might be worth it to most people. Trickle of cash recieved in perpetuity? Might be able to finance pretty high quality shows.<p>OK - flight of fancy coming: How about an investment market for television shows and movies? People put together trailers, pilots, or maybe just announcements and attachments to a project, and people can buy shares in that project based on how many absurdly cheap downloads they think it can wrangle, and they buy those shares <i>on the same site where the torrent will be hosted for download</i>. The gambling prospect would be a pretty good incentive for people to already have credit card attached accounts when it comes to downloading, and good investments could pay for your habit, or even bring a return. These shares could be traded in perpetuity, and would pay dividends monthly of the download revenue minus the infrastucture cost.<p>Even farther down the rabbit hole: The cost per download could be determined by an (open) algorithm combined with a voting system by the current shareholders. If they're not liking their return, they could state what they think the ideal price would be to maximize that return, and that price would be weighted with their amount of ownership to determine the current price of that content. Maybe to simplify that system, they could be given simple upvotes and downvotes? I feel that the math could be worked out.<p>This would incentivize shareholders to market the content themselves in social and in blogs.<p>Completely crazy talk: Free downloads of collections of trailers. Shareholders of one film could vote to dilute and give shares in their content to the shareholders of content that is sure to attract a large group of eager downloaders, in order to have the trailer to their film or sample of their show included in a collection that the known anticipated content will also be on.<p>-----<p>Maybe this is an efficient way to motivate people to<p>1. Invest in the shows that they like,
2. Proselytize about the shows they like,
3. Watch (and pay trivial amounts for) content in order to be familiar with the market (especially obscure content, to get an edge.), and
4. Set by guessing the prices that people would be likely to pay for content.<p>For me, this might be the MMORPG/fantasy baseball from hell. I'd be futzing around with my investments and looking for new things that were coming out <i>all day</i>.<p>edited: for clarity.",1315103911

2958627,comment,2957949,2957949,3,0,mgkimsal,,,"""What, your life-dreams arent worth $10k to you?""<p>Well... the problem is often that money is just part of it.  Just because you spend some time and $10k (or some mixture) doesn't guarantee success.  But... staying put in a job for those same months will very likely guarantee that $10k.  And most people need that money because they're living, if not check to check, then dangerously close.<p>Additionally, it's typically <i>not</i> just that $10k.  When that's spent, and the idea hasn't taken off, what should you do?  The logical/safe thing and go back to the w2 world and keep working?  Or do you dig in a ""refuse to give up!"" like so many self-help books/cds would tell you to do, and what so many tech/successporn blogs talk about.<p>""Look at all those 'founders' who are wildly successful!"" you can say to yourself.  ""<i>They</i> didn't give up!  When things went bad, they did a pivot!""  And so you'll pivot, and spend more money, etc.<p>For some people, the journey <i>is</i> the reward, and that's fine for them.  <i>Personally</i>, for me, having a long runway and low expenses would be important before trying to focus on any one idea (and that's what I'm working towards).  So... in my case, and perhaps for many others, the ""micro-actions"" are (or should be) getting your finances in such a state that you can fund your own idea rather than pining away for investment money.<p>The ""more criticism you receive means you should push on because it's a good idea"" is... frankly, bizarre.  There's probably a lot of counter examples to scenarios I'm thinking of, but often times people really do criticize something because it truly is bad.  Not everyone is a negative dream stealer full of ""stinkin' thinkin'"".<p>As you said, you need to apply some 'common sense', but that's what's truly uncommon.  People closest to their idea often are too emotionally invested in their baby, and to tell them ""criticism == you have a good idea"" would cause many people to spend a lot more of their time and money in pursuit of a bad idea.  People also need to learn to separate criticism of the core idea/concept from criticism of the execution of that idea, to the extent that's possible.<p>Anyway, lots of reactions to that piece - thanks for posting it :)",1315102022

I wish we could find a way to encourage people to be genuinely respectful of all members of a community.  Often, the people in the ""in"" crowd become some of your worst members over time as it becomes impossible for anyone to have a reasonable disagreement with them and it becomes a huge issue about ego and so on.  I've been a prominent person on a forum or email list and hated it.  Prominence makes it very difficult to have meaningful conversations with people.  People tend to divide up between those who want to adore you and hang on your every word and those who want to kick the living shit out of you simply because it's you, often pissing all over you about some point that their comment history indicates they actually basically agree with.  Most human communication is very much about things like pecking order and other social considerations, more than about meaningful ideas and so on.  Hacker News is better about that (about making it about ideas and content, not social status crap) than most places and it is one of the reasons I participate here while having dropped out of so many other forums/email lists.  But there is still plenty of that here.<p>I wish I had some brilliant suggestion to further improve it. I don't at the moment.  But I very much appreciate you taking the time to post this.",1315101762

I only found it by randomly mashing everything on the screen on the theory that surely the functionality had to be somewhere. I think the problem is that it doesn't look at all like an active UI element.<p>- Going directly to comments doesn't seem to be possible. I guess you can just tap the list item and then show comments really quickly, but I would have expected tapping the comment count to do that.<p>- Would be nice to see which stories / comment pages I've already viewed.<p>- Would be even more awesome to see in the main list how many new comments were added since I last viewed the comment page of a story.
- Is it really not possible to view more than the top 50 items?",1315101687

If that's not the case, we should be able to determine that fairly soon (a few years, perhaps).",1315101654

80548,comment,79982,80484,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"There's a distinction between me signing messages and me not being anonymous.  My lack of anonymity is guaranteed by the user name I chose plus the fact that my profile links back to my personal web site.<p>Signing messages was unrelated to anonymity, it's a years old habit that I started on Usenet and continued in online forums like this one.   I don't claim that signing messages is part of the ideology I was talking about above.   If I did I wouldn't have stopped.<p>It amuses me that you choose to describe it as a 'personality defect' from behind an anonymous account here.  If we were standing face to face would you describe me signing messages in that way?",1195194589

But that costs 100s of dollars per month, which might be ok in your case, I don't know.<p>Maybe you want to go with Symphony instead.<p>I'm not so much against big rewrites, you just have to figure it out yourself if you think it makes sense.",1192114580

Many people still pay for bandwidth, and they would be able to turn off prefetching in order to minimize usage. By using iframes or AJAX to prefetch, you may be costing the user money that he doesn't want to spend.",1192114123

What difference does it make if they load some stuff in your browser cache. What extra information does that give them?\nHow is this spying?",1192113423

But take the Valley mentality, double the fund size to $40 mil, and while the approach will still very, the dollar size of investment all of the sudden becomes very similar.

What do you guys think?<p>- Hecl - scripting language for J2ME, mobile phones.  I think this is the coolest thing I've done in some ways, but one of the least likely to be profitable (no one makes money selling languages).<p>- Linux Incompatibility List - leenooks.com - a list of hardware that <i>doesn't work</i> with Linux.<p>- LinuxSi.com - List of stores in Italy that sell computers with Linux, or at least without Windows.<p>- Rivet - <a href=""http://tcl.apache.org/rivet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tcl.apache.org/rivet</a> - this one's mostly on the way out in terms of my involvement, but I still have some obbligations.<p>- ShopList - <a href=""http://shoplist.dedasys.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shoplist.dedasys.com</a> - a shopping list app for mobile phones that some people seem to like a lot, because it's done right (data entry is via the web, not the phone).<p>- Squeezed Books - startup idea that's basically as far as I'm going to take it without an uptick in interest.<p>- Stuff to Do - a time tracker/todo list that's now open source.  Not really going anywhere at this point.<p>- Tcl book - book on the Tcl programming language that's in its advanced stages.  I'm really torn about this one - Tcl isn't going anywhere, but publishing a book would be cool.",1192112644

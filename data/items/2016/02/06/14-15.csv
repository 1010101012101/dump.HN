He shared some numbers too.<p>The conversation was from last... sep I think, and he was referring to a change a few months back.  They had been able to buy the whole screen units for around $25-$30/piece, and his shop (owned a few) bought a lot of them - always kept a lot in stock.  Earlier in 2015, he said, Apple started putting the screws on their parts suppliers, requiring them to destroy any overages or extras that didn&#x27;t pass QA.  This overage supply was where he and others would get their replacement parts.<p>He said that almost overnight, the prices on those screens went to $40 or more.  They had a several month supply, but were already having to replenish at the higher price point.<p>So... Apple knowing about &quot;third party repair&quot; stuff, isn&#x27;t all that new, but they seem to be taking more steps to actively prevent competition here.  :/<p>re: &quot;renting&quot; - they&#x27;ll probably still sell them, but all but force an icloud-style service for storage (probably still be selling 16g models when they provide 16mp cameras, and use up 6g for the OS).  That or perhaps they&#x27;ll just buy a carrier and you can be paying them $100/month for voice/data service directly, on top of $700 for a device.",1454770751

It&#x27;s condescending (and meant to be, don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s not) to call someone or something &quot;retarded&quot; when one is actually expressing an opinion that the person or thing is not worthy of merit, and history is rife with abuses that result from trivializing a group of people by distilling that group to a pejorative. &quot;Fuck those short sighted motherfuckers,&quot; may shock because of the direct use of the glorious and multitalented root word &quot;fuck&quot;, but it certainly isn&#x27;t trivializing a group of people with a minor vision impairment, because short sighted is not the term used to refer to someone who is <i>near</i> sighted. It&#x27;s borderline lazy, sure. It may offend someone&#x27;s sensibilities, yeah. But choosing a word that one knows <i>damn well</i> trivializes a group of disadvantaged human beings ... that&#x27;s profoundly different from dropping the occasional F-bomb.<p>It&#x27;s not about political correctness, it&#x27;s about recognizing that one&#x27;s choice of words can carry a great deal of meaning that diminishes the intended effect of those words. In some cases, by literally dehumanizing a group of people.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;colorful language&quot;, it&#x27;s lazy and careless prose.<p>And to any current reader of this comment who thinks such pejorative language is okay in civilized company: either this post changes your mind, dear reader, or it doesn&#x27;t. Using what you think to be clever analogies, closed-minded logical fallacies, or meritless affirmative defenses (&quot;but, freedom of speech!&quot;) is encouraged, if it makes you feel better about yourself to put me in my place for feeling the way I do about this kind of language. Your right to free speech is no different from mine, I won&#x27;t stop you. But I also won&#x27;t waste the expression of my free speech rights by trying to argue with someone who doesn&#x27;t acknowledge that maybe ... <i>maybe</i> ... they&#x27;re wrong, so please feel free to satisfy that desire to get in the last word.",1454770737

Then those people can say FUCK YOU back and have a whole steaming flame war. It&#x27;s all speech.

Or do you expect a real answer?).<p>If you really care :-) :<p>I had the chance to be raised and still live in a very mixed part of Paris. There is racism, of course, and for example I can remember how kids of Portuguese descent were the object of mockery back when I was young. (That&#x27;s significant because today it&#x27;s put under the carpet as if it never occurred. It seems nobody even remember!).<p>That makes you think about bias, how bias turn into systematic racism, etc. That makes you discover how people of course cluster around commonalities but also like to share and connect with others when given a safe context.<p>Racism is quite pervasive in France, and for example younger generations make it a central part of their dialogue and jokes. But many people are working toward inclusiveness too.<p>Just like women equality and wealth sharing, non-discrimination is not solved thing in any given society: it&#x27;s a constant challenge to tackle, probably without an end in sight.<p>It&#x27;s probably the same for individuals: how can I be more inclusive?

11047943,comment,11045526,11047533,0,0,notalaser,,,"> The difference is that with microcontrollers, what you see is what you get. The API is defined by the hardware, and most of the time you&#x27;re just poking numbers into registers. There&#x27;s nowhere else to go.<p>No it&#x27;s not. In real life, it&#x27;s fairly rare to write 100% bare-metal applications, and even when you do, you&#x27;re often writing against some &quot;homegrown&quot; abstraction layer. Sometimes you&#x27;re expected to write such an abstraction layer, but writing only against the hardware-defined &quot;API&quot; is usually not strategically sound, unless you have a very good reason to assume that the underlying hardware will never change. This is sometimes true for very resource-constrained microcontrollers, and virtually always true for things that have ARM in their name and stronger. Not to mention for embedded, but relatively high-power devices (see e.g. the Linux kernel).<p>Sure, the drivers are hardware-specific, but the applications are usually programmed against their (unitary) interface.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing against the rest of what you mention -- I&#x27;m painfully disappointed by the neverending spaghetti of technologies that modern web is, and I also think it&#x27;s largely self-inflicted. However, web dev is treated as much more of a commodity than other branches of programming; left to their own devices, there are a lot of web developers who would produce very good client-side code.<p>Shit like bootstrap isn&#x27;t there because web developers are incompetent. It&#x27;s there because much of their job involves churning out support code for products managed by people who know nothing about technology and the WWW, whose quality standards are dubious at best and who value product conformance over performance because they sell perception, not quality.",1454770381

He&#x27;s right that ML models have bizarre failure cases across large sample sizes, but he&#x27;s apparently career-endingly wrong to seemingly believe that one cannot do anything about it.  He&#x27;s also wrong IMO to not recognize that hand-crafted signals and features lack bizarre failure cases themselves.<p>IMO this shifts the focus from lovingly hand-crafted signals and features to lovingly hand-crafted loss functions and variants of boosting and training algorithms to address those bizarre failures as they occur.  For example, recently much ado was made about minimal changes to the input data to image recognition convolutional nets to spoof the object ID.  And the simplest remedy is to augment the training data with these cases and perhaps boost the gradients of outputs that are wrong.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but Google search was never perfect either.  Evidence: I was on the Google search team for a bit and we had all sorts of meetings to address such failures as they happened.<p>While I agree that the quality of Google technical searches has declined dramatically recently, I believe there&#x27;s huge opportunity to fix them by understanding why the ML models are failing (shooting from the hip, I suspect it&#x27;s a long-tail problem writ large) and changing the loss functions, models and training algorithms to address these failures as they&#x27;re detected.<p>Anything less IMO is a failure of imagination in an age of 6.6 TFLOPS for ~$1000 and the ability to stuff 8 of them into a $20K server and go wild.",1454769623

I find it to be a frustrating technique, but I can&#x27;t deny there are many people who find it useful.<p>I&#x27;ve watched a handful of video walkthroughs of TDD, and gotten frustrated at the lack of good testing or development in them. One example is Robert Martin&#x27;s primes kata. His solution works, but realistically only for small numbers. He never specified an input domain, and during development never tried to identify ambiguities between the API &#x27;promise&#x27; that the function would take int32, the expectation by most that it&#x27;s fast to factor 2,147,483,647 (2^31-1), and the reality that his code would take a long time for that.<p>You write &quot;I think after-the-fact tests added after you already have decent coverage&quot;.<p>I love code coverage as a way to identify missing tests. For me that&#x27;s usually in error handling.<p>Many of the TDD writings, going back to Kent Beck, say that TDD will naturally lead to high code coverage. I think that&#x27;s wrong. I again thing many of the TDD writings ignore the problems that can come up during refactoring.<p>I think Martin&#x27;s TDD style works because the problem he uses are &quot;simple&quot; in an algorithm sense, which is why he can talk about a &#x27;Transformation Priority Premise&#x27;. Martin says &quot;Refactorings are simple operations that change the structure of code without changing its behavior&quot;, but as I wrote before, &#x27;substitute algorithm&#x27; is not a simple operation.<p>Then again, I think most businesses only need simple algorithms, even if the overall goal is quite complex. My complaint is about where TDD isn&#x27;t enough.<p>So if you also include coverage and after-the-fact tests, that would be far beyond what I&#x27;ve seen so far in TDD walkthroughs.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think many people will watch a code walkthrough, so don&#x27;t expect much fame or uptake from your series.<p>That said, yes, I think it&#x27;s a good idea.<p>&quot;but it does force you to design it in a unit-testable fashion&quot;<p>You might want to read <a href=""http://www.rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Wa...</a> . There&#x27;s a follow-up as well. He argues that most time should be spent on integration testing, and I agree.<p>I think unit tests implicitly enforce an API on the code, even when there&#x27;s no need for an API. It&#x27;s a special purpose internal API designed for testing. Because they are internal functions, you should have the freedom to refactor them, but the unit test burden keeps you from doing so. (In one TDD kata we did, we got working code, then compared it to others who were there. Our code was several times larger because we had tests for multiple code layers, while they only had one layer. We could have removed the layers, but that would have called for rewriting most of the unit tests, and I think that inhibited our design sense.)<p>In my own code, most of my tests are base on a unit-test framework but I almost only use the public API (for the library code) or a call to main() (for the command-line code). I feel this gives me more freedom to refactor without worrying about the extra work to change the unittests.<p>Anyway, Coplien describes it much better than I, and my comments just now don&#x27;t even apply to a &quot;sort()&quot; function as that would be a public API.",1454769590

11047770,comment,11045412,11046868,0,0,Manishearth,,,"> it&#x27;s also a much more pleasing language to write in (the lack or sum types or generics in Go is very annoying)<p>Interesting anecdote: Last year, for a course I had to write the assignments in Go. As a Rustacean, I grumbled about the lack of sum types a <i>lot</i>, and made various hacks via interfaces writing unidiomatic Go code to simulate them. My code design was also very Rust-y and unidiomatic.<p>This year, I&#x27;m TAing the same course, and there&#x27;s a similar assignment. One student&#x27;s submission was eerily similar to my design (by now I knew that it was unidiomatic), down to the hacks used. It also contained a comment saying &quot;missing Rust&#x27;s enums&quot; (my code contained a similar comment to explain the hacks). At first I thought it may have been copied from my code (which can be found if you&#x27;re looking for it), but it was different enough in other areas. I dug a bit and found that the student was indeed a rustacean.<p>It&#x27;s rather interesting that two rustaceans used the exact same hacks and same overall design when asked to code in Go.<p>Surprisingly, I don&#x27;t miss generics too much in Go. interfaces used to make me cringe due to the extra runtime cost (since I knew Rust before learning Go, and such solutions would make me cringe in Rust), but once I got used to Go I learned to use them properly. Named interfaces are pretty easy to use and let you structure the code decently well, just like proper generics. They may have a runtime cost, but Go doesn&#x27;t put as much focus on that as Rust.<p>On the other hand, easy-to-use non-hacky sum types are something I miss from Go <i>all the time</i>.",1454767244

Most people look back and remember how hard/dumb/boring/useless that one class was and how they never use it in real life.  Barely anybody looks back and remembers how something that they learned in their math class was integral to their ability succeed later on in their career.  For example, almost everybody complains about how hard/useless calculus was.  These same people are able to take a volume integral in cylindrical coordinates no problem.  There is a fundamental disconnect here.<p>And anything you don't remember?  Well, being familiar with a concept makes it a hundred times easier to learn the second time.",1320634796
3204778,comment,3200096,3202531,2,0,6ren,,,"TL;DR My view is that if Einstein hadn't proposed his theory of relativity, someone else eventually would have (especially as the evidence for it accumulated) though it probably would have taken several <i>decades</i>. That is, ""1.8 Einsteins"" is an accelerator, not a possibility-maker - in the same way that 1/10 Manhattan Projects is an accelerator (and we've spent many Manhattan's worth on AI already).<p>---<p>Einstein wasn't the best mathematician (he was good enough to do the maths his physics required, but he needed help and other mathematicians of the time, such as Laplace, were better). What Einstein had was an insight, and an iconoclastic attitude that allowed him to overturn established dogma - far from being a barrier that he had to force himself to overcom, it seemed to energize him.<p>I think of Einstein as an explorer. To be an explorer, you need to have the abilities of an explorer and the boldness to try to new things. There also need to be things that haven't been discovered yet, but whose existence is hinted at (e.g. Earth didn't seem to be traveling through an ether).<p>- Without puzzles to connect you to reality, it's very hard to come up with breakthroughs that matter.<p>- Without an individualistic attitude, you won't be willing to pursue lines of inquiry that everyone else says is stupid and a waste of time.<p>- And without the necessary ability, you <i>do</i> it; you can't work out the details to show that it's consistent, you can't make predictions that could be falsified.<p>In Einstein's later life, he didn't come up with further breakthroughs. Was this because his intellect lost the sharpness of youth (so that Einstein himself was now < 1.0 Einstein)? Was it because he became attached to his own dogma (e.g. god does not play dice with the universe) - his biographer, Walter Isaacson thought so. Or was it because there weren't any amazing discoveries within reach of current experimental evidence? (a lot of work was done on quantum mechanics, an area Einstein didn't want to pursue; later theories like string-theory do not explain experimental evidence in a simple way).<p>I'm not just writing an essay here on Einstein - I'm talking about the basis of scientific progress. It doesn't depend on ""genius"" (e.g. ""1.8 Einsteins""), but on those three things: sufficient ability; attitude; and unknown discoveries being within reach. There's also persistence - Einstein took about 10 years to generalize his ""special relativity"". A better mathematician could have done this much more quickly, but they didn't think it was worthwhile. He did.<p>I also interpreted ""1.8 Einsteins"" as an accelerator, because of the context of 1/10 of the Manhattan Project.<p>And if you include everything that contributes to better computation (cpu, memory, bandwidth, languages) as well as explicit AI research (though note that once computers can do something, there's a tendency to not call it ""AI"" anymore e.g. chess playing so that explicit AI research includes more than it might seem at first), then many Manhattan Projects have been spent on AI, with some progress, but without the slightest hint that we are anywhere near within reach.<p>---<p>As a final point, even if the statistical unlikelihood of a 1.8 Einstein meant that AI was likely impossible for us, why does it follow that you disagree? It may well be that it is possible to understand intelligence enough to create it - but that <i>we</i> aren't intelligent enough to do it.<p>Most of our intellectual progress proceeds from standing on the shoulders of giants; which usually involves a level of abstraction that makes things simple again (i.e the complexity required for <i>understanding</i> a level in itself isn't cumulative; we can understand one aspect at a time). I personally experience this all the time - the only way I make progress is by forming a theory of a confusing thing, that separates out a level, or an aspect, and makes it simple enough to bring it within my intuitively grasp.<p>Is it impossible that there are theories so interdependently complex that we cannot separate them out in this way - that there is no component that we can understand in isolation that will help us understand the whole? i.e. irreducible complexity. Note that all our scientific progress is based on things that we <i>can</i> understand. There could be many true scientific theories that we could not even formulate - and how would we know?<p>Note: I personally think AI is possible, that we will be able to understand it. But I recognize this is an opinion, not a fact.",1320634762

It is exactly (half of) what you said it is: boring low-level rigor.  It is absolutely not of ""limited use"".<p>Your comparison to assembly/Python doesn't fit at all.  You cannot start in on vector analysis without an understanding of geometry and algebra.  You can start Python without understanding assembly at all.  You can go back and learn assmebly after you've learned Python but this isn't true in most cases with higher level math.  How do I explain the chi-squared distribution without wasting the entire semester on basic maths?  Math isn't like an Apple product, it doesn't ""just work.""<p>Some make the argument that how we teach STEM based courses can be adjusted so that we start from high-level stuff and teach low-level mechanics along the way.  While this approach is intriguing, it will never work.  It relies on an assumption about students that isn't true: they are actually interested in the subject.  If I had to guess the percentage of students with a deep interest in their subject I would put it at a little bit below the actual graduation rates.  Most students are in degree programs nowadays because it is the next step, all of their friends are doing it, it is expected of them, and/or they are trying to make their parents happy.  Many of these students will find out what it is they really want to do (whether it is in their first field or their second field), many will recognize that they hate their field and still slog through for social reasons, and many will fail.

3204735,comment,3202816,3203663,9,0,strlen,,,"[ First off: I'm a committer on Project Voldemort, a Dynamo-style distributed data store ]<p>First, Riak is excellent. I can only say positive things about it as well as the folks that work on it.<p>Re: ""store for unimportant data"". I'll go beyond that. Not only should new databases be suitable for reliable storage, new databases should do things than existing databases can't. I am a bit sad that NoSQL had become to mean ""replacement for an improperly tuned, ad-hoc sharded MySQL setup"". To be clear, having a simple setup that provides partitioning, replication and defaults more tuned to modern hardware is a fine goal -- but why not do better? If I wanted something better than MySQL, I'd use Postgres (or properly tune my MySQL installation).<p>For example, Dynamo-style stores allow for any replica to initiate a write (something not possible with primary copy replication), allowing high availability applications. Some systems (Voldemort, riak-core, HBase with co-processors) also allow custom code to run on the server, significantly extending the capability of a system in a way in which a store procedure can't.<p>It's also sad to see NoSQL style systems repeat many mistakes that MySQL has made. MySQL in late 90s with MyISAM is a completely different beast from MySQL today with InnoDB: far better concurrency, durability, referential integrity, better replication. BerkeleyDB JE is also a powerful beast: log structured storage (this is why we're using it as the default storage engine in Voldemort), Paxos-based leader elections with tunable replication.<p>Schema-less data or (as in Voldemort) evolvable schemas is also a huge feature, but it's not impossible to replicate it on top of MySQL (e.g., Friendfeed's data model).<p>Here are some things that I'd like to really see evolve in NoSQL space:<p>* Support for new and interesting distribution models. Allowing users to choose between eventual consistency, quorum protocols, primary copy replication and even transactional replication.<p>* Support for large, unstructured blob data: Riak is going the right way with Luwak, I believe Facebook has been using HBase as a front-end for Haystack -- it would also make a great choice for Haystack's metadata store.<p>* Most NoSQL systems support transactions within the scope of a single value (or document) via the use of quorums, serializing through a single master, etc... However, it'd be nice if something like MegaStore's Entity Groups (or Tablet Groups in Microsoft Azure Cloud SQL server) were supported.<p>* Secondary indices, whether internal or external (by shipping a changelog) to the system.<p>* True multi-datacenter support (local quorums if desired, async replication to the remote site) including across unreliable, high latency WAN links (disclosure: Voldemort supports this -- <a href=""https://github.com/voldemort/voldemort/wiki/Multi-datacenter-results"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/voldemort/voldemort/wiki/Multi-datacenter...</a> )",1320633485

Once capital can be used to buy capital that produces capital you have eliminated humans from the equation. There is a level which we are approaching where some industries will become almost entirely automated. What happens in that situation is a few people make all the money and the rest don't. We are seeing an ever increasing disparity between wealth gained through capital investment and wealth gained directly through labour. Even high-end labour produces far less money than investment does. Most high-end labour tasks are tightly coupled to capital investment.<p>Do you really think that the history of wealth production is somehow going to change radically to a sudden redistribution of wealth to everyone so they can relax and take it easy while living off the fruits of others investments?",1320633162

All the interesting math is locked away, available only to those who suffer through meaningless tests and bureaucratic madness. It would be much better to introduce higher level topics first, showing students the incredible usefulness of high level math, and then using their curiosity to dig into the lower level concepts that make everything work, instead of forcing them to try and be interested in boring low-level rigor that , without a high-level structure, is of limited use.<p>It's like we're teaching kids mathematical assembly language instead of Python.",1320633115

It requires a certain disposition to be willing to sit with a problem for minutes or hours and have faith that you will be able to find the solution. The fields are also littered with geniuses and people with significantly more talent than yourself. The gap between those who tried and those who were gifted was severe at my alma mater(USC).<p>I remember being in an intermediate mechanics course with only physics majors when our professor asked us how long it took us to complete the homework sets. I was regularly spending 15-25 hours a week on them. Some of my classmates were completing the sets in 2-3 hours. What shocked me wasn't that there were students who could complete the assignments that quickly but that:
1) students were either taking 2-5 hours or 10+ hours to complete the assignment. It was very bimodal.
2) that the gap in efficiency between the best and worst students was almost 10x.<p>In comparison my estimate of the gap in efficiency between the best and worst medical students is 1.5-2x at the most. No medical student can claim that they can accomplish in 2-5 hours what would take another medical student 15-25 hours to learn.<p>In the end I made the choice to go in to medicine where I was consistently in the top 3% of my class. There were a handful of 'superheroes' in medicine but not many. Most of us started in the same place and where we ended up ranking in our class was a function of effort.

If people really have been able to pick degrees that are ""simpler"" than science or engineering and find jobs making six figures in the U.S., it's not hard to imagine that companies might find it hard to hire enough qualified workers for the ""harder"" disciplines.  In a job like software, the difference between an outstanding developer and an average one is orders of magnitude, so it's very unlikely someone else can be trained properly.<p>Also consider, if there were no visas, companies might not have U.S. offices <i>at all</i>.  If you have an office of 500 people, 300 of whom are from other countries, the cost of the U.S. office may be justifiable.  But suppose you weren't allowed to have foreign workers live here.

If not the money would usually go to reinvestment or some other sort of purpose. I think that taxing capital gains as if it was regular income would also be a fairer way to tax since a significant portion of high net worth individuals make most of their money from capital gain and pay less % taxes than upper middle class individuals.",1320631715

The most notable of these languages C, and it's one that has gained a good degree of traction over the last year or so.<p>While I like and applaud the intention of these languages, I question their necessity and worry about the knowledge gap they create. More importantly, they all fail by requiring that you be an expert in two languages. Let's face it, you can't just program C without knowing machine language, unless you're willing to defer debugging to someone who does. If we're already willing to learn both languages and then spend time reading and debugging compiled C, why not just write good machine language from the start? For the extra effort you'll make learning C and its idiosyncrasies, why not put it towards really learning machine language?</i><p>Hmm?",1320631712

With extremely cheap energy (both environmentally and financially) synthetic product should not be too expensive to compete with slaughtering real live animals. We are predators, yes, but that does not mean we can step up the ladder and satisfy our diet using a higher level of technology without any real animal suffering. This does exclude meat gained through hunting to keep populations in check.<p>Factory farmed animal meat is just something so morally repugnant to me. If there's no real need for it, why do it?<p>>And then they replace the mechanics and programmers with genetic algorithms.<p>I don't think this is logically possible. The job of a programmer is to transform human intention and desire into a computer readable input. How would you determine a heuristic for the genetic algorithm? The heuristic would have to be written by a human being on some level. There's only so far you can automate automation itself and I think you are grossly underestimating how difficult it is or will be.<p>Programming is a trinity between human paradigms, algorithmic mathematics and magic. The closer you bring the math and algorithms to the human paradigms and desires, the more it will resemble magic. It is an asymptotic progression. The magic will be never achieved.<p>What you are talking about is constructing the perfect programming language. People have been trying to do this since the start of previous century (Lambda calculus). You really think we will experience some tremendous leap in the close future?<p>In short: you will always have to have a way to describe what you want of the computer, and this is called a programming language.",1320631672

That very busy, selective individual probably has friends who are less mobbed by pitchers.  Those friends might even be flattered to hear from you.  Pitch them, with the goal of convincing them your startup/story/invitation to dinner and a movie/etc is so attractive that it is worth giving a warm intro to their friend.

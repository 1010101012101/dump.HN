1802201,comment,1801846,1801846,0,0,goosmurf,,,"I find most of my investments through 2 methods: general news as an indicator of future growth prospects, and through industry stalking.  I am primarily interested in high capital growth and mostly invest in an industry peripherally related to my own work which I can keep tabs on through industry contacts (i.e. who's hot, who's not).<p>In both cases those methods yield potential investments which I then look at financials as a basic check - does this company's balance sheet and P&L indicate anything obviously dodgy?  More importantly, do their accounts offer any insight as to how their business is actually going; in many cases I find this is not the case as through sufficient accounting manipulation little reflection of reality is left in the reported figures.<p>In terms of your service what I would like to see is some sort of graph of executive management & directors and their histories.  I have a personal blacklist of individuals based on their ability to ruin companies, and I also have a few folks that I basically would invest in anything they do.  This is largely industry specific though not always the case as there are folks from finance & legal backgrounds who end up being chairmen or directors across a wide variety of industries; this can be good for finding investments in new industries.<p>Another thing is the company's history, particularly (but not limited to) the balance sheet.  In some cases future prospects look great but the company has burnt existing investors through heavily dilutive raisings (as an example).  These holders will suppress any rise in price so for me that is a reason to stay clear despite everything else.<p>You asked about ""before"" but on-going is also important. For the small (speculative) companies that I invest in I try to stalk most of their staff; in particular I want to know if key members of staff leave (not necessarily executives); or if there is unusually high turnover.  Tools like LinkedIn and Twitter have made this a lot easier but it would be great if it could be automated.",1287370711

1802132,comment,1801898,1801898,0,0,jfarmer,,,"Hmm.  This is very interesting.<p>A few facts:<p>1. When you embed an iframe with fb:iframe, the parameters Facebook passes to your app get passed to the iframe automatically.  This includes the Facebook UID.  This is the way everyone has always embedded Facebook ad units and AFAIK nobody has ever been punished for doing so.  I've had people at Facebook look over my apps with a fine tooth comb when dealing with TOS violations and this has never once come up.<p>2. Facebook will take action against apps if people use fb-provided widgets in ways that ""violate"" the TOS, i.e., if Facebook's own widgets violate the TOS they will take action against the app.<p>This happened to be with the fb:wall widget, where Facebook told me I wasn't allowed to have comments auto-post to people's walls (the default behavior) and must include a ""report"" link to every comment (impossible / not a feature of fb:wall).  They disabled feed posting for one of my apps due to that ""violation.""<p>3. Facebook, as an organization, hates, hates, hates bad press.  They will move mountains to prevent or preempt bad press.  I've had people at Facebook tell me more-or-less verbatim that whatever I did, my applications were not allowed to generate bad press for Facebook.  If they did, I would be banned.<p>4. Facebook will scapegoat companies.  When the Scamville drama happened, Facebook banned Gambit payments from the platform and threatened any application developer with banning if they used Gambit.  They were no worse than Offerpal or Super Rewards with respect to the types of offers they were running -- everyone was getting their offers from the same pool -- but Facebook banned Gambit and implicitly endorsed Offerpal and Super Rewards.<p>Gambit was the smallest of the three, so the general feeling in the FB developer community is that they picked the weakest one and took them out to show how ""serious"" they were in dealing with the problem.  They also made SR and Offerpal clean up their offers and punished Zynga for running questionable offers, but only Gambit was permanently and forever banned.<p>So, given the above, I have to wonder...did Facebook ban lolapps, the smallest of the major FB game companies, from the platform as a way to preempt the press fallout from this article?<p>Very interesting.",1287369377

1802108,comment,1801796,1801796,0,0,pshapiro,,,"I started with Core Animation. Now that you know C and some objective-C, you need to learn about Quartz, NSWindows, MVC,  AppKit, Foundation, and other parts of Cocoa like Core Data (more on this later).<p>My first serious project with Cocoa was on a fairly tight timeline (a month for two apps, in fact) and I had only attempted tictactoe in Obj-C years before. What I did was immerse myself in the material and my project.<p>The project itself was for a museum in NYC, which has 30"" touch-screens that let the visitors interact with a visual catalogue of the collection. This was a great introductory project for a few reasons.<p>First of all we had a great design partner. He built a very simple interface that remained constant through the entire project because he thought it out concretely before implementation. In other words, he considered the data very carefully and determined the fixed way to present it.<p>The second thing is that in order to import this collection's catalogue into the app, I had to build an XML parser that runs on a background thread while the UI displays a loading screen.
That part was a good introduction to building an app and watching what it does in the Console, without getting into the nuances of Core Graphics and drawing, etc.. I recommend you start with something like this so that you don't get overwhelmed. It's extremely important to learn about correct memory management. Once you've got the basics, look into @property also.<p>From there, I had to learn about how make an application with a special kind of window, work with drawing NSViews and CALayers onto the window, learn about CAAnimation, Core Graphics, etc.<p>Before I built the app, I worked out my equations for laying the content on the screen and what kind of transformations I'd need to apply. Then I was able to set about building it simply.<p>At the time I didn't know this, but I can tell you from experience that it's very much worthwhile to look into Core Data. Even if your project is very simple and you require persistent data storage.
 I personally like to use json-framework and serve my app bundled JSON at initial lunchtime, with net updates after that, then do an import into my Core Data model, but this is really decided by what kind of app you want to build. I used XML for the museum project because we didn't know about json-framework yet. But it turns out that JSON translation into Cocoa objects has been much faster.<p>From here, you have a few options. You can either continue to develop on the desktop or you can move to iOS without very much difficulty.<p>If you are going to write mobile apps later and your app will interface with an existing web service, you may be better off using three20 and its http request libraries with JSON support to get data in real time. The Facebook app works like this.
Actually three20 is a great option to go with for many apps. It's worth a look too, but make sure you understand UIKit as well as you can before you use three20. You still need to know UIKit to use three20 properly.<p>In order to determine what project you should build try to observe what kind of problems you have in daily life and what could be built to facilitate them. OS X is a wide topic and you could be talking about a GUI application, a kernel extension, or perhaps a web server. Each of them are projects which could take a month to build.<p>Hope this helps. Don't hesitate to ask any questions, and remember that Google and the Apple dev forums are great resources.",1287368885

I'd get all excited about these huge claims (e.g. ""Mac Mini is built just for taking over the living room""[1]) and would start talking to anyone who would listen about these big, exciting possibilities.  Then I realized it was just a gripping style of writing and the ideas weren't particularly earth-shattering... or correct.  THEN, I found out the guy's a liar: ""In 1998, it was revealed that Stephens had falsely claimed to have received a Ph.D. from Stanford University and to have been employed as a professor there.""[2]<p>Haven't read much Cringely since.

Nature has blessed you with the ability to stay up late and still get things done the next day.<p>Most people in their twenties abuse this skill and go out partying all night.  I know I did a lot of that.<p>The reason you have this skill is because it's designed for child-rearing in your 20's.  That's my hypothesis.  People with children don't get much sleep.<p>So either use this skill to push your career/skills forward, or use it to raise small children while you're still young.  Either way will leave you better off. If you push hard to make some money, and then have kids, maybe you won't need to work 9-5 when you do have kids.  If you have your kids early, then you'll have the time and energy to put into your work when you're a bit older, because your kids won't be draining your energy.<p>The sub optimal solution is to have your kids later on, at the same time you realise you need to work hard to push ahead.

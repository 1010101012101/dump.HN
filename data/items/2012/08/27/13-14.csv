(Rounded rectangles, Slide to unlock,  Elastic bounce, seriously?)<p>One thing I can conclude honestly (also from my own personal experience) is that we live in a very unfair world, being ruled by an unfair system, where someone who has the highest amount money will always WIN and RULE the system. Our governments are in bed with the entertainment industries for a reason. Think about it (ACTA, SOPA..etc). I was expecting the result to be something like what happened in Korea, where Samsung And Apple were found guilty and BOTH had to pay for damages. But this is a ridiculous - Apple has been sued by numerous competitors and yet it didn't infringe even a single patent? Come on...clearly this system is biased.<p>For those who think Apple deserved to win, Apple did not do this to protect their IP, they are just suppressing their competitors by suing them. Why is Apple going after HTC and Motorola? I personally own a HTC and it looks and feels nothing like an iPhone. Apple might have 'innovated' as many claim it to have, but it has hindered more innovation than it has ever contributed. The case for HTC, Samsung and others today might be the case for you and me tomorrow as well, considering we start a phone company tomorrow. We are as vulnerable as they are. And Apple is the most innovative company in the world? Come on..innovation by litigation??<p>Well Apple, your end is very near, which is reflected by your panic, suing your competitors.

Universities were not meant to be very practical; they are meant to 'shape your mind' with solid foundations for learning new things and for an academic career. Now this is much different and the actual function of a university, because it's so common to go there, moved from that old view to the realism of the day; students need to actually find a job in corporations. It'll change, albeit slowly.<p>One of the biggest problems I found in PT is the difference between Lisbon and 'the rest'.

I'm sick and tired of people twisting reality to fit an Apple anti-hero narrative.<p>They are just as guilty as any other hardware/software manufacturer which tries to stifle human progress in the name of ego.<p>Let me provide my perspective, as flawed as it may be. In 2006, Nintendo released the Wii. To those who don't know, it, for better or worse (re)introduced motion within the context of video games. Immediately, Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony (PlayStation) criticized the Wii's motion controls  deeming them ""childish"" and ""not what gamers want"".<p>Today, we know how that story played out. We have PS3 Move and Xbox Kinect. At the time, I had hoped and dreamed that Nintendo would sue and strike back at Sony and Microsoft (not sure if they had the grounds to, mind you). I didn't want Microsoft and Sony to benefit from Nintendo's genius, especially after they essentially deemed motion control as a ludicrous novelty.<p>Today, Microsoft Kinect is making all sorts of cool innovations possible  not Nintendo. But in 2009, I would have been happy to hear that Microsoft would have no right to create Kinect. What a lousy outcome that would have been. Kinect, as a technology, is a benefit to a collective of people  and I was a dink to believe another outcome would have been better. Chalk it up to being a Nintendo fanboy.<p>Today I'd be incredibly angry if Nintendo had the power to overturn, punish or fracture the Kinect technology. And watching Apple fanboys defend a system that essentially holds us all back is incredibly painful to watch. Apple has created a contemporary masterpiece and it is now the baseline for which all better technology evolves. What happens if you get your way and no one can build in the direction that is proven to work?<p>Stagnation. Thanks for that.",1346073320

I have been in this business for 20 years and I don't really care about money very much. I need it to feed my chickens, brew my beer and play with my ancient electronics. I actually take pleasure in seeing people become something they never thought they could be. I wake up in the morning thinking about some great project we are doing. And I definitely want my employees to share the wealth if there is any to share.<p>500 euros (200-300...) is crazy, people going for that we would not hire because they have no idea what they are doing and that reflects in their work. And you can hardly live of 500 euro/month here in the mountains (and it's <i>really</i> cheap here), let alone in a city. So don't assume too quickly :)<p>I stand by my comment that I think if you have a warm heart for your country you should stay there and help (re)build it. I told this to my former Ukrainien partner who had the choice; go to the US or run the company in Ukraine. He choose the latter after many talks and he is a very rich guy now, having helped around 1000 people to a job in his poor city. That  was not me ; that was him, but I do tell always to stay IF your motivation is career/money/happiness. Those are fixable, and even more so, in your own country especially in a crisis.<p>I am not a patriot by any means; I love the south of Spain, the east of Germany (saksische sweiss) and Portugal (esp Madeira) much more than my country the Netherlands. I am making companies in all these regions to be able to move freely and with pride between them. I am assured i'm helping in my own (little) way and all the regions I like are poor and yet I haven't found any lack of money resources, even in the regions themselves. I can make enough money to live happily WITHIN the regions I like even though people say there is no work/money. It's not me being special or gifted; it's other people are so non-creative, it scares me often.<p>And no; moving to Germany is not considered a 'risk'. Working for a small company with a year contract is. It's pros/cons; my assumption (which seems to be right with most people) is that people want to live close to family and friends and not move 2000+ km away.",1346072846

4438583,comment,4431630,4432264,1,0,nileshk,,,"> I disagree; the entire point of the Windows key is that it isn't interpreted by applications. It provides instant keyboard-driven access to OS/shell functions (i.e. cross-application functions), and I love it.<p>I get that, and I understand what Microsoft is doing, but I don't think the two usages are mutually exclusive.  So it can be used for all it's current functions, but individual applications could assign shortcuts to Win + [modifier key(s)] + [key] or even Win + [key] (providing warnings if it conflicts with an existing OS/shell shortcut).  Users should be able to override existing OS/shell shortcuts for something else if they want.  I understand that this means that if Microsoft introduces new Window key shortcuts in future releases, this could potentially conflict with existing application and user assignments, but I think the benefits make this worth it.  As it stands, Microsoft is wasting the full potential of the Window key.  Maybe there are some guidelines they could establish that would leave things open enough for future releases (e.g. applications shouldn't assign Win + [key] combinations, it must be Win + [modifier(s)] + [key]).<p>In OS X, you have some cross-application functions using the Command key, but applications can use the key too, and when there is the possibility of shortcut configuration, users can choose whatever [modifier(s)] + [key] combination they want.  Granted, many of the usages of the Command key are for in-application shortcuts, but I don't see the huge benefit to isolating a single key for only cross-application functions that is worth giving up a potential modifier key.  I'm ok with using multiple modifier keys for new cross-application functions that may come in later OS versions, or sorting out conflicts that may arise.  I'm ok with the ""cheese"" moving a bit, and I think those who aren't wouldn't be heavy keyboard shortcut users anyway.<p>Maybe there is the possibility for this in Windows already, but I just haven't seen it?  Apparently One Note has it's own shortcuts that use the Window key, but that is a Microsoft application, so they may be using private APIs or something.<p>I haven't been a heavy user of a Linux or X11 GUI in a while, but back when I was, in Gnome/KDE/etc you could assign the Window key to whatever you wanted, and it was mostly unused by applications by default, so I was able to assign it to window manager functions, etc.  The defaults of Gnome/KDE seemed to be mimicking Windows.  If I went back to Linux, I would try to setup an arrangement more like OS X, or at least come up with something more comfortable for an Emacs user (e.g. Ctrl-V should do page down, not paste; I have setup OS X to act that way through a 3rd party app).  The beauty of Linux is that you can configure things how you want it, and you are not stuck with what the OS designer thought was the best idea.  I haven't used Ubuntu Unity, but if that happens to be restrictive, there are plenty of other window managers that aren't.<p>I must admit I feel the same way about Fn keys on laptops: that's another modifier key I could be using that is limited to only a handful of functions.",1346072660

In addition, some overzealous firewalls block PUT and POST. Thus, some RESTful APIs accept all requests via HTTP GET and place the HTTP verb in the querystring. For example, to delete user 124, the GET request would be for the following URI: /users/124?method=delete This technique is especially common in Ruby circles. Another benefit of this approach is all requests can be easily generated and manipulated in the address line of any browser.<p>This is a <i>very bad</i> idea for something like delete.

All a monopoly is a cornering of the market for a particular thing and you could even see entertainers as having a monopoly on their own unique offerings.<p>Most of the things people consider monopolies actually have competition.  Its just not quite exactly the same, as cheap or as good.<p>If you had a monopoly on the automobile, there would still be the bicycle, the train, the horse and buggy, and of course, walking.  These all compete with people just moving closer to work.  Or living near a navigable body of water or getting a helicopter.<p>And lets not forget that the government is handing monopolies in exchange for sharing ideas (also known as patents).  When such a deal makes sense for society, the monopoly is a good deal.  When it isn't, we shouldn't be granting them.",1272196752

You can avoid that somewhat if you map some sort of keystroke to right-click (for some reason, f12 is common), or use a more text-heavy environment.<p>Yeah, I realize it'd be weird to buy a MacBook just to run xmonad on it, but they really are nice physical machines, as far as laptops go.",1272196443

It is always better to eavesdrop on the other unknown civilization before they eavesdrop on you. It gives you the chance to make a decisive move: invade, cloak, whatever. Hawking is dead right.We should be expanding in a way that is as invisible as possible to the rest of the galaxy. When we do find the aliens, we should pursue a normal intelligence gathering approach, collecting lots of information about them while misrepresenting ourselves as being more primitive and harmless than we are. Self preservation dictates this sort of stuff. It could explain the Fermi Paradox.",1272196167

1292564,comment,1292550,1292550,0,0,_delirium,,,"Seems somewhat backwards. This relies on a how-did-it-get-there argument: is a monopoly the result of illicit activity, or did it get there by ""winning"" in its market segment? For example, this passage, from the article:<p><pre><code>  If such status is gained by competition in the free-market then the
  ""monopoly"" -- the successful business -- is good. If such status is gained 
  by using the government, or Mafia, to force one's competition out of 
  business, then the monopoly is evil.
</code></pre>
But most antitrust theory isn't based on any sort of historical-deservingness argument; rather, it's based on the fact that a monopolist does not operate <i>in</i> a market, but <i>is</i> the market. Monopoly power is market-distorting, and prevents the normal free-market mechanisms from working to allocate supply and demand efficiently--- even if the monopolist did nothing ""wrong"" in getting to be a monopoly. The main argument for anti-trust laws is that society is better off when the ""invisible hand"" can work its magic, and use of monopoly power, especially to influence other markets (e.g. Microsoft demanding that Dell not ship any non-Windows computers), prevents the market from operating efficiently.<p>Some more modern, mathematically-heavy theory phrases this as more or less an issue of feedback behavior: in a properly functioning market, the market is determined by something <i>outside</i> the market mechanisms themselves (idealized as ""real"" supply and demand), but in a malfunctioning market, the market mechanisms themselves feed back into the market, so it's mostly determined, self-referentially, by itself.",1272195555

You should characterise the determinant as the highest order form in the Exterior Algebra[1] and then use the fact that it's a group homomorphism so det(UAU^{-1}) = det(A)<p>That's not to say that I agree with the GP.  There's a lot to be said for testing the ability to perform abstract calculations with no practial use.  A dimension 6 determinant seems completely unreasonable though.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra#Functoriality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra#Functoriality</a>",1272195291

People (normal people, not geeks salivating over specs) don't care how fast the CPU in their console is - they only care which games can be played with it.<p>They can still compare the quality of the consoles (newer, bigger, nicer, games will run on newer consoles, but not on older - or, one can complain about lack of DVD playback on Wii, without going into tech details).<p>(Feature) phone market used to be like this, too, at least from what I remember in the past 13-14 years in europe.

The pilot made only one landing attempt that failed, the other ones are the standard procedure in Russia where ATC take you down step by step in the traffic pattern - make you flight 3 or 4 circuits round over the runway. Also the captain didn't have much hours of flights compared to his years of experience - a common pattern in the east countries who don't have much money for military aircrafts expenses. It looks like a flying error at the end, he maybe have turned over the trees (probably because the NDB wasn't on the runway centerline), and was too low too early...

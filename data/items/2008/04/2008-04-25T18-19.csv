173801,comment,173548,173613,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I agree.  My only input is that I believe entrepreneurship is about wealth creation.<p>One can make the argument that if we make money for VC's, then we make money for ourselves.  I think there are plenty of examples (especially in the Silicon Valley) where this is true.  That's the ""a small slice of a large pie"" school of thoughts.  The other side of the same argument is that if you bootstrap your company, then you are on your own and the world conspires against you.  So at best you have ""a large slice of a small pie"".<p>I think these are false choices.  My own experience (I had two startups, one of each) is that bootstrapping is not a lifestyle but a tactic in wealth creation.<p>I believe the speakers at Startup School are all in agreement that the world has changed and that it is possible to build a meaningful company with sustainable revenues by bootstrapping.  But bootstrapping does not mean that you don't take VC money, just not for R&D.<p>When you have a working product and a workable business model, then you can go out for VC money, but now as ""working"" capital. And if you can take it further and actually become profitable, trust me, VC's will be kicking down your doors wanting to buy a piece of the action.<p>I enjoyed the Startup School presentations very much, especially that of PG, PB & DHH and the following is my takeaway ...<p>“Make something people want … don’t ignore but try to understand [people’s] advise … listen [mainly] to yourself … don’t worry too much about money … the secret to making money online … is to ask for it.”<p>I believe they are arguing that the optimal solution might be ""a medium slice of a medium pie"".

173799,comment,172915,173597,0,0,petercooper,,,"You can guess someone's age within a few years at an interview if you wanted to discriminate, so blocking a mention of age is naive. You could also work it out in most cases from the dates given on the resume (unless it becomes illegal to learn about a candidate's education or work history - which wouldn't surprise me to be honest).<p>You could see what neighborhood someone lives in because that will also be typically included on a resume too. Why would you hire someone who can't even put their street address on their resume? Sure, a street address doesn't have much significance to /most/ hiring decisions, although if you knew a candidate would have a 100 mile commute each day, choosing someone who lived around the corner would make a lot of sense if the job required call-out or easy access to the office.<p>And so it goes. You'll see someone's race at interview. You can probably even figure out if someone's married (presence of a ring). It seems crazy to make it illegal to ask these questions. Instead, it should be law that it's optional for the candidate to ANSWER them.",1209148595

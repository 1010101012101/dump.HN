  On the last night of the year
  The Zune did sit and cower
  For it knew its end was near

  The Zune was cold and tired
  And although it was un-wired
  It had no friends to squirt
  No friends to be inspired
  And it feared the end would hurt

  But when the clock ticked ""Two""
  A byte did move; a bit was flipped
  The program shuddered; then it tripped
  The old brown Zune was through

  Thirty gigabytes are soon made full
  Thirty gigabytes are what it's got
  Thirty gigabytes are quite a lot
  Thirty gigabytes of cotton wool

  The Zune has passed; it took a fall
  The music's stopped
  the stock has dropped
  It never ""Played for sure"" at all

  We wonder where is Balmer
  And imagine that he's ranting
  And raving at his crew
  They wish he would be calmer
  And stop his sweaty panting
  Oh look! He's thrown his shoe!</code></pre>",1230742577

415630,comment,414330,415023,0,0,mmmurf,,,"I have no problem with a program designed to subsidize housing for people with tax dollars.  If the democracy decides that people with attributes x, y, and z deserve a $2000/month housing subsidy, that's fine.  It's no different than the subsidy given to mortgage debtors (tax breaks), parents (the child tax credit), electric car owners (tax credit), student loan debtors (student loan interest deduction), farmers (direct subsidy), etc., etc.<p>But consider how paternalistic any of these programs are compared to simply giving the person cash to spend on whatever he/she wants.<p>Also, the above programs are taxpayer subsidized so the burden is distributed across all taxpayers.  Rent control, on the other hand, screws over the building owners only, effectively making a single building owner personally provide a $1000+ subsidy to a hundreds of people.  Compared to a broad, taxpayer-subsidized program, this is equivalent to a 70% additional tax just on landlords, this is on top of that person's fair share of income and payroll tax already being paid!<p>The biggest problem, though, is the distortion caused by rent control... which causes all of the problems in my above post.<p>To make obvious the issue of price controls leading to shortages, consider this:  During the 1970s when Nixon instituted price controls on gas at the pump, there were massive lines outside gas stations.  This was not due to the ""evil Arabs"" withholding gas.  It was due to the price controls:  People who would have decided to carpool or walk if the price had been at market price decided to buy gas at Nixon's price.  This led to huge lines.",1230742358

There is nothing to explain, there is no ""explandum"", so to speak. There is no such thing as ""redness"", there is only the fact that a human subject will use the word ""red"" to refer to an electromagnetic pulse of wavelength 600nm. The subject will say ""red"" to relate the wavelength, that is, we can predict the subject will say ""red"" if asked for the ""color"" of a pulse shone at the subject of wavelength 600nm. There is simply nothing to explain in qualia, it does not exist.<p>To steal from Dennett, one might as well ask about gremlins that appear in the cylinders of a combustion engine. We can explain the fact that wheels move in a combustion engine via the action of the cylinders, or, we can say it is the action of the cylinders plus the gremlins. Thinking of qualia as something that needs explaining is like thinking that your car's movement is predicated upon the gremlins produced in its cylinders. The gremlins do not exist, neither does redness, nor any other type of qualia. Period.",1230741253

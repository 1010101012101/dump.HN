That being said, we just had an article here where someone claimed to have created a spreadsheet in pure javascript for some absurdly low number of lines of code. When you read through that thread there are all sorts of people pointing out that this isn&#x27;t a <i>real</i> spreadsheet by any stretch. It merely looks like one, but is missing some pretty complex and necessary stuff. I would submit that what you see here is the medical device equivalent. There are no safety mechanisms, the system doesn&#x27;t monitor itself for failure, there&#x27;s no characterization of the limits of the system in various conditions, etc... That&#x27;s fine because it&#x27;s a <i>hobbyist</i> setup. But let&#x27;s not kid ourselves about what it takes to have a reliable device that works in a hospital setting under a multitude of environmental conditions.<p>Things didn&#x27;t end up the way they are by accident.

6732252,comment,6731263,6731620,2,0,Xixi,,,"My policy is to stick to a couple of stacks for projects I will have to maintain 5 years down the road: currently Python/PostgreSQL for server side code, and AngularJS or Unity for client side code (depending on the nature of the project, but really there&#x27;s not much overlap there). It will definitely evolve whenever I find something warranting the switch, but the bar is set pretty high. At the end of the day it&#x27;s what you ship that matters, much more than how it&#x27;s built.<p>On the other hand, when I get to do a short-lived project I tried to use a new technology: that&#x27;s still the best way to learn, plus it&#x27;s loads of fun. If it&#x27;s great then I start using it for longer term projects: that&#x27;s how I found (and so far sticked to) AngularJS.<p>In 2013 I shipped small projects built on top of nodejs, chicago-boss (erlang), meteor, but also RethinkDB and coffeescript.

6732243,comment,6731140,6731140,2,0,jones1618,,,"It&#x27;s a really cool project and performs reasonably well but I have issues with some of the interface choices:<p>1. The navigation controls are non-intuitive and don&#x27;t follow most 3D movement conventions. I wanted right-click panning and some shortcut for orbiting (not having to change modes).<p>2. Positioning is erratic. When building something it would randomly refuse to let me draw on top of some cubes even when I precisely positioned my cursor on the top cube surface. Positioning guides would be nice: Highlight adjacent surfaces, draw alignment axis, etc.<p>3. Conversely, erasing a bunch of blocks would fail because the erase cursor would &quot;hop&quot; on top of (some not all) blocks I wanted to erase.<p>4. The &quot;thicken&quot; operation sounds handy but never worked for me even once I figured out (I think) that you have to select blocks first. I expected I could select blocks and then pull them up or out to duplicate them.<p>5. Having a multiuser environment default to fill/drawing mode is a horrible idea since _everyone_ spews blocks all over the landscape destroying stuff before getting the hang of it. Suggestion: Give everyone a protected 30x30x30 home sandbox where no one else can draw. Everywhere else would be free range.<p>Overall, you have the tech down but the UI needs playtesting. Watch novices and Minecraft-ers try doing something more than scribble with it. You&#x27;ll know your interface is working when you start seeing more than blobs and piles littering your world.",1384437435
6732242,comment,6731072,6731072,2,0,brudgers,,,"Basically, 10% equity when someone holds 51% boils down to being entirely dependent upon the majority owner&#x27;s goodwill in so far as the value of that equity is concerned. A majority owner can sell the entire company or some of its assets on whatever terms they choose, whenever they choose, to whomever they choose...including themselves for a song before a profitable resale. Or they can redirect its cashflow to their own pockets via rental agreements, leasing arrangements, consultant fees, or well you name it. And absent a well negotiated contract on the part of the 10%, even lawyering up won&#x27;t do much beyond draining your pocket book.<p>Now I mention this because the arrangement described sounds a bit like an offer to come onboard as the hired help. But just a bit since there&#x27;s not much hiring going on when there isn&#x27;t a paycheck.<p>With 51% the Owner remains an owner, and is not someone who is looking for a partner or a collaborator. The value they place on technical ability is reflected in their decision to outsource development. The lack of revenue and runway suggests their level of financial savvy.<p>That they would even seek four people to work without pay and control?<p>Well, draw your own conclusions.<p>Good luck.",1384437432

I&#x27;m surprised nobody suggested that answer so far, unless I missed it. That doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;ll never find out or make any progress, but we don&#x27;t know now. Personally, I see value in such a direct answer.<p>If the question is &quot;Are the laws of physics as we know them deterministic?&quot; that&#x27;s a question about human knowledge and the most effective equations and interpretations of them we have. We can answer that question definitively, but that doesn&#x27;t answer the original question about the universe itself.<p>If the question is about the universe itself, all we can offer is the laws of physics we know, which brings us back to the first point.<p>We have incomplete knowledge of the universe. No experiment has been done yet to conclusively answer the question, so all we have is opinion. Anyone suggesting otherwise either knows of an experiment I don&#x27;t (I&#x27;d be overjoyed to find out), or stating mere opinion. Opinion is nice, but it answers the question &quot;Do you <i>think</i> the universe is deterministic,&quot; which is not the question asked.<p>Edit: I see someone put this answer on the original site.",1384436761

We will have different confidence levels for different descriptions (e.g. deterministic vs. non-deterministic), based on how well they match the evidence, but we can never know for sure. Therefore the interesting question is how confident are we that nature is deterministic / non-deterministic.<p>> But the other thing to point out is that this question presumes an old idea about the passage of time, which is that things happen in a sequence A, B, C, D, ... and that if you are at C then D &quot;has not happened yet&quot;. But if you look at relativity, this appears to be a nave viewpoint.<p>In relativity, the notion you described is replaced by the weaker notion of causality. It says that for each observer things will still happen in a well-defined sequence, even though different observers will not agree on questions such as &quot;did these two events occur simultaneously?&quot;. The way these statements can be consistent, is that events for which there is no agreement on ordering can never influence each other (this is a mathematical result).<p>Due to causality, the question of whether nature is deterministic is well-defined even when relativity is taken into account.",1384434804

(See <a href=""http://computer.howstuffworks.com/flash-memory1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://computer.howstuffworks.com/flash-memory1.htm</a>). To run the

The same is the case for the CPU executing the code.<p>Point of note is that transistors are used in all three cases (flash
memory, RAM and the CPU), but the voltage levels for 1&#x27;s can be
different in each case. The voltage level is part of the design of the
flash/RAM/CPU. (For example, when designing a CPU, choosing a voltage
level is a tradeoff between performance (higher voltage implies faster
clock speeds) and power consumption (higher voltage drains the battery
more)).<p>If you&#x27;re asking when the 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s became voltage levels, the answer
is that they were created as voltage levels in the first place. At the
physical level, the 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s are always voltage levels. When you
compiled your code, the code generated by the compiler was represented
as voltage levels in the CPU, then was written to RAM, which again was
in voltage levels, and then written to the SSD of your MacBook Air,

Of the 55 passengers that have one or more devices, maybe 30 turn off their devices as they are told, 15 put them on airplane mode and 10 don&#x27;t give a shit or just forget it.<p>If there are 20 million flights per year there have been some 400 million flights in the 20 years where cell phones have been common. 400 million flights of which 99 percent have flown with some passengers&#x27; phones turned on. Has there ever been a single flight accident due to cell phones? Just one?",1384434683

A quine contains a complete record of itself.  That&#x27;s an extreme case to be sure, but it does seem to provide at least one counterexample . . . (of a system that contains itself, not necessarily a system that actually observes and records itself)<p>A recording of a system does not need to contain everything in order for that recording to by played back, as long as the replay system is deterministic -- you just need to record the random inputs.

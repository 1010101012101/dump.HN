So it would be cheaper for the government to keep those employers afloat.<p>The obvious counterargument to that is that the auto companies could take their $25 billion and <i>still</i> go under.<p>The counter-counterargument is that even if that happens, it would be better for everyone if they went under a few years from now, when hopefully the rest of the economy will be in better shape.",1227149935

GM et al, did not create the credit crisis.  They did not create the bad economic conditions.<p>But we want them, and more importantly, all the people working in that industry to suffer?  Honestly, I can't imagine how letting them fail won't cause more than 25 billion in economic damage.",1227148501

Don't worry if people don't start bidding immediately, but I suggest you go out and try to drum up some tech news about it (TC, ReadWriteWeb, etc).

Offering GPL only would restrict the use of your code to inhouse development and personal projects.<p>You could ALSO offer a ""commercial"" licence. That would give users the right distribute your code with their closed-source commercial code.<p>The dual licence approach means that users that aren't making money off your code don't have to pay, and those that are do.<p>On the repository point: I'd suggest putting the current code onto something like Google Code. If you're not moving the code forward and no one else can fix bugs or make improvements, then the project is basically dead.",1227147829
370230,comment,370024,370029,0,0,lnguyen,,,"1. The license you choose probably won't make anyone more inclined to hire you for consulting.  You're better off trying to decide how open you want code and contributions to remain.<p>2. While a revision history is nice to have available, odds are most people aren't going to really look back at older versions of the code.  Some code cleanup and documentation would be preferable (but does require your setting aside time to do that).<p>3. You'll never know until you do.  And it doesn't cost you anything to do it.  (With some exceptions... see #5)<p>4. You're not claiming its perfect so don't stress too much about it.  Part of what open source is about is allowing someone to see what makes everything tick, warts and all.  Because someone could always contribute back fixes.<p>5. Have you thought about where you're going to make your code available (Sourceforge, GitHub, etc.)? Is there going to be a Google Group or something so people can ask questions or share their experiences with the code? Even if you're not expecting a massive wave of adoption, having some of that in place can make everything better (both for people interested in your code and yourself).",1227147762

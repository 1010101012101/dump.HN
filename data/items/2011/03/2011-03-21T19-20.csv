I talked to my sister after purchasing it online and she told me that they were in an Apple store the day before and he had mentioned that he wanted a magic pad.<p>Shit.<p>So I called up Apple asking if I could return the magic mouse that I ordered online for the trackpad in a store because there wouldn't be enough time with Christmas fast approaching. The customer support guy put me on hold for a minute and then told me that in light of the Holiday Spirit they would send out a trackpad with express shipping free of charge. I could return the magic mouse if I wanted or keep both.<p>Fed Ex ended up dropping the ball on the express shipping, but still Apple stepped up and made my day! I ended up giving him the magic mouse for Christmas and then the trackpad a month later for his birthday.",1300737573

I wonder if the user/customer will come back after saying him ""Do give it a try after a while"" instead, I think more appropriate way would be to tell/respond him when you are done fixing the issue, rather than user checking whether the issue is fixed. Also, the later deepens the bond between you and user(taking appropriate (such) small steps makes all the difference and this is what separates you from your competitors coz everybody has hold on bigger steps).

2351283,comment,2349389,2350079,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"I don't think vowel differences are sufficient to deem a language impossible to romanize.  Japanese has been romanized effectively for decades despite the fact that Japanese vowels are quite different from English ones.<p>I think this comes down to two competing approaches in transliteration:<p>1.  Transcribe the original non-roman text into something that a native English speaker would read correctly without help.  This never works well due to vowel differences and accents, but nevertheless it works <i>well enough</i> that it's very popular.  An example of this failing horribly:<p>Hiroshima: often pronounced Hih-RO-shih-mah.  Actually pronounced Hee-roh-shee-mah (nevermind the Japanese R).<p>2.  Romanization without intent to be pronounceable.  Nihon-Shiki romanization seems to use this approach: it's unreadable by English speakers, but unlike other romanization schemes, provides a one-to-one mapping to the original kana, i.e. it loses no information.<p>I think it's important to note as well that ""roman letters"" != ""English""; Nihon-Shiki is an example of this, the creation of roman letters intended to be pronounced by non-English speakers.",1300737500

The delivery option seems a neat way to transport it to the (generally) non-walkable US environment - I suspect you will have even better luck in other urban markets.<p>Consider offering a discount for 4+ portions per order. There are a lot of families who have a ""delivery"" night to ease the planning/cooking/washing-up burden and would also subscribe to something like this, instead of resorting to pizza. No need to pitch the whole thing around lone office workers, even if that is the obvious market.

2351261,comment,2350967,2351153,0,0,lsc,,,"Personally, I think that when you are small and not very profitable, lowering the complexity of taxes would help you more than lowering the tax rate. Most taxes are on profit (or on income) and nearly all of them are graduated.   Before you are making much money, you don't have to pay out much in taxes.<p>However, tax complexity makes planning much more difficult.   I've gotta include a tax person in my decision making process.  Now, once you are big, this is no big deal, but as a smaller entity?  this is kindof a big deal.  And it's another huge risk factor.  If I screw up and end up in massive debit to one of my vendors or a bank or something, worst case I can declare bankruptcy.   If I screw up my taxes?  There is no such escape route available.  I know more than one person who will spend most of their career in debit to the IRS because they thought they could do their own small business taxes, and screwed it up.<p>So yeah.   for startups?  I think complexity of taxes, ultimately, is a bigger deal than the tax rate.   This reverses, I think, as the company becomes more profitable.  Lower tax rates are going to make profitable businesses more profitable, so lower tax rates would increase the upside for any startup.   But I think that reducing the complexity of the tax code would help those who are still teetering on the edge of profitability more than reducing the tax rate.",1300737161

Insider Trading laws were passed a very long time ago to protect the investor or was that the real intention?  Could one not argue that Insider Trading laws prevent information leakage so that the real insiders CAN make money without the small investor being involved?   In the age of Wikileaks, can we really contain information or judge its use? Should we try?
Okay, here is another way to look at it.  Say there was a car race from LA to NY and first 12 people to reach would get a $1M bucks each but driving over 55mph and getting caught could land you in jail.  If those where the rules, why would a small group the 12 NOT conspire with the Highway Patrol to take out all potential winners?
Conspiring with Highway Patrol involves a lesser risk with same returns compared to driving over 55mph.  Could the SEC be the highway patrol and Goldman the conspiring gang?
The real question is this.  Does it make sense to enforce laws with such intensity on a few people for something that most people are suspected of doing?  Ticketing a bunch people makes sense because the penalty is on a curve.  The more people break the law, the more people get tickets.  But, is that true when it comes Insider trading?  Or is it more like, most people break the law it but few people pay severely.  Is that control by fear? Are those the breeding grounds for corruption at the core?
I think the even bigger question is this:  Are insider trading laws valid in upholding their intent to protect the average investor in the information age?",1300736216

In my experience, there is no widely-used post-build-time system for declaring or checking dependencies except for OSGi, which is not spreading like wildfire as I expected it to.  The Java model seems to be to bundle all your dependencies into a single deployable app, performing all dependency checking at build time and carefully isolating your app from other apps in an application container.  I.e., don't even try to solve the problem of sharing libraries between applications.<p>Oddly enough, C has superior runtime checks (dynamic library loading using major version numbers) and install-time checks (*nix package dependencies) compared to dynamic languages.  It is very, very strange to me that other language communities have neither embraced alternatives such as OSGi nor worked to transfer responsibility to native package managers such as dpkg or RPM.  C et al. under Linux have set a standard that other language communities don't seem interested in matching, much less exceeding.

And as a gift card, I still think I'm correct, this is not a great value proposition, primarily because <i>you can't actually use the money (which comes in via PayPal) to buy stuff wherever you are</i>.  As someone that still remembers all too well being in college with $3 in my pocket and an overdrawn bank account, the greatest thing about gift cards was that they let you actually buy stuff immediately even if you have no money.  The Paypal involvement bollockses that up, and that's not good; it also makes the fact that you're sent to a physical business kind of annoying, since you can really only use the money for online stuff unless you transfer it out of Paypal first.<p>But...<p>I had similar ""who would ever use that?"" thoughts about Foursquare when it launched, and had to revisit my feelings after seeing its success.  It turns out that even if there's little value in the actual <i>services</i> provided, people really like the types of game mechanics that location-based apps make possible.  This, IMO, is where GiftRocket should be focusing: they really should be pitching a <i>game experience</i> instead of a mere gift card.<p>I can easily imagine people setting up scavenger hunts, races, treasure maps, etc., if the site was set up to make that sort of thing easy and fun.  You could even set up entire Amazing Race-style multi-leg races if it was done right.  There are a <i>lot</i> of possibilities, and I could see the same sorts of people that get really into Foursquare getting really into this.<p>Don't get me wrong: I think this is a pivot that may need to be made, it's not where they are right now.  As-is I don't see much emphasis of any game-mechanic in the marketing (and for that matter, the most likely fun applications, races and multi-leg treasure hunts, don't seem to be possible to construct), and the exclusive focus on sending people to businesses may not turn out to be the best approach unless they can start to sign on businesses to sweeten the deal (I'm sure they <i>can</i> line up things like 10% off if you redeem a gift card there or something like that). But even that's a bit of a shift, and it puts them more in the discount-seeking business than the gift card one.<p>Or I could just be wrong.

As a vacation house owner that rents their place out 3/4 out of every year, it was a waste of my time.  I have been a VRBO user for 5 years, and they have driven a lot more traffic for those time periods, with a lot less hassle and restrictions.  Frankly, for the serious vacation home owner, I don't think VRBO / HomeAway has anything to worry about any time soon.I want to stress that I think AirBnB fulfills a market need, for sure.  Just not my market.Kind of like trying to race the Indy 500 in a cute Ford Focus.<p>Here is my experience so that you can compare for yourself.  I am quite certain that I will probably have someone from AirBnB comment and tell me that I just didn't know how to set something up right.  That's fine.  Still doesn't change my perception of the system being to hardwired for the novice, single room renter:<p>1.  The setup with AirBnB was a lot easier than VRBO.  The AirBnB interface is slick and nice..definitely pulled me in. :-)<p>2.  They have a major glitch in the system.  I put in daily rates for the off-season, and weekly rates for inseason...yet the daily offseason rates kept over-riding the weekly in season rates, and this caused a lot of potential renters to be very confused when they thought they were getting the ""steal of a lifetime"" on summer rates.  Left a bad taste in my mouth, and with the prospective renters.  VRBO may be more difficult to set up, but it's pretty idiot-proof when it comes to rates (thank God).<p>3. WIthout exception, every single client that inquired via AirBnB wanted some sort of discount or deal.  99% of my renters via VRBO will rent at the full rental price.  And,my prices were exactly the same on both sites.<p>4.  I cannot control fee or deposit scenarios on AirBnB. I am forced to follow their sites rules - which are heavily in favor of the renter and do not protect the owner enough (IMHO).  Payment isn't made to the owner until the renter checks in, and there is no way to note a pet fee requirement.  This scenario is not acceptable to me.  It's too easy for a renter to cancel at the last minute, which puts me in a huge bind if the rental period is during the high season.  On VRBO, I require a deposit up front, equal to half the rent, in order to secure my property, and a pet fee (which is legal in my state) per pet.  Been working this way for 3 years.<p>5.  In addition, the refund system is lacking in AirBnB.  I have to select from their refund options.  I cannot employ my own refund system.  This, to me, is a big drawback.  Each rental home owner I know has their own refund policy.<p>6.  AirBnB controls all monies.  This, to me, is the biggest issue I have.  I am a good owner.  I always seek to make my renter happy.  I will go above and beyond to do so.  I resent having a 3rd party determine if and when I get paid on my rental property. This is why I got rid of property managers in the first place, it's a layer of bureacracy that I don't need.<p>7.  Vacation rental rules - many vacation areas have their own county or state rental laws and regulations.  To my knowledge, the constraints put in AirBnB's system for booking or refunds do not leave room to incorporate those laws, potentially putting homeowners at risk.",1300735382

Unfortunately, because of the price, I could only purchase a limited number of topics.<p>It is a pity that massive repositories of Learning Channel content (some of it probably unused because of South Africa's recent ill-advised, and soon to be reversed  curriculum changes) are hidden behind a 20th century paywall.<p>South Africa, despite expensive and limited bandwidth, has a long tradition of students actively using this sort of instruction (via vhs/dvd and tv broadcasts). Distributing Khan Academy videos and Mindset Learn, and especially freeing and distributing Learning Channel videos could make a huge difference to education here. If someone has a philanthropic need to save millions of children in a third world country from chronic unemployability, those would be the first easy steps to take.",1300734139

Despite this, more games are sold for consoles, and developers target them.<p>The same effect can occur for iOS devices - and their graphics will get better each year (9 times faster this year...)",1300734052

There are only so many engineers and skilled workers. Increasing demand further would have caused even greater inflation and more social unrest than they had anyway.

481344,comment,481211,481340,0,0,newt0311,,,"Update: A way to make sense of this is that China is making a <i>massive</i> bet on the future of the US. Namely, they are assuming that the US will continue to be rich which will maintain the value of US securities which can eventually be cashed out for tangible goods and services. The problem is that the future of the US is dependent in a large part on what the world thinks of it. Thus the catch-22. As long as everybody thinks that the US is rich, they can trade on that. Note that this is just another symptom of a bubble and when this one bursts, its going to make the great depression look like good times.",1234639477
481343,comment,481211,481331,0,0,newt0311,,,"Right now, the major barriers keeping China's capital in China are actually chinese regulation and china's economic growth in that order. China has very strict capital regulation on how money can be moved around across borders. Also, so far, the Chinese govt. has only been interested in holding on to US treasuries so that capital is effectively out of circulation. Lastly, even if some chinese citizen is allowed to invest in foreign infrastructure, why would they when the chinese infrastructure is experiencing faster growth?<p>Still, once these regulations prove too onerous to maintain (which they will) and once China's economy stabilizes, we will suddenly find that half the US is owned by China and that will cause the labor markets to shift again possibly moving production back to the US and away from China. Still, thats ~20-30 years away and who knows what else might happen in that time.",1234639339

Could they not instead put that excess money into building things they desperately need, like roads and schools?<p>Investing in a first world infrastructure would stimulate growth at home and lessen their reliance on our consumers (whose buying habits have recently become rather fickle) and our Treasury. The second part may be more important too, with our country hurling toward a Social Security meltdown.

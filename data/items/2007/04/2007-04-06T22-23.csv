9752,comment,9704,9704,0,0,Mistone,,,"Hello, I would definitely be interested on getting some space  
in SF but not so much if you are thinking of a South Bay location.     
I'm currently based in Petaluma so I would also need to get setup living wise in SF but this is in process now, so not a roadblock. 
This is exciting, let me know what I can do to assist. ",1175899680

9750,comment,9711,9711,0,0,zaidf,,,"Once I have some money in the bank, I want to escape to an island, assemble a small team of medical researchers and find a cure for a genetic condition I suffer from. <p>Each time I get an episode of it I can't help but wonder why it is that much harder to find a cure for it than fixing a broken computer:) May be I can use this innocence and get somewhere. Medicine is the last thing of my natural interest but in this context I really hope to take on this fun challenge at some point.",1175899079

I'm sure it would be a huge undertaking because of things the hardware limitations & time it would take to update things... but once in place, it'd be well worth it for everyone involved.

9747,comment,9711,9740,0,0,randallsquared,,,"I'm still working on the details, but the direction I'm moving mostly consists of taking the best ideas of current payment systems and leaving the worst ones out.  The trickiest one involves email addresses as the payment identifier.  That seems like a good idea at first glance (and had me fooled for years; I'm from a payment systems background), but I think it turns out to have been a bust.  <p>I'm also not particularly interested in P2P payments, as there are lots and lots of systems out there for that, and it never has really taken off.  The dominant system is still  merchant/customer, and I think it will continue to be for a number of reasons: each person receiving payments needs a lot of people paying to make any given activity worth doing, and people just don't seem to pay each other tiny sums -- and paycheck-size sums are already handled well by check/ACH, direct deposit, and so on.<p>But given the level of funding I'll need to get this started properly, it certainly isn't a YC app, so I have to succeed with some other interesting project first. :)",1175898679

9739,comment,9711,9717,0,0,rms,,,"I worked for US Airways in maintenance/engineering and I think that most of their problems stem from trying to run an enterprise on 70's era mainframes and software. So much extra labor is required to do things that should be automated but instead require lots of human hours. But, they're incredibly resistant to change and spending money.

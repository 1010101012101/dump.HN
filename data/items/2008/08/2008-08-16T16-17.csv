- this evolution will see less apps mimicking native desktop-OS-imposed widgetry (like 280slides trying to look like MacOS), resulting in a soup of shades-of-gray --- and more like the many usability-centred, colourful web apps out there. Desktop apps will rather tend to mimick that than the other way around.
- There is no good reason for 280Slides and other Office-on-the-Web solutions to so closely resemble the desktop experience of 90s-style applications (other than, perhaps, customer expectations and user acceptance). GUI is something that can, and should be radically rethought and evolved, all-the-time.",1218904700

You get your players to pay $15 every month, for many of them over a period of one or two or three years, you get a much longer shelf life than regular games which likely make most of their sales in the few months after release, and in some cases you can have your cake and eat it too - if you manage to get away with the $60 upfront purchase AND the $15 monthly fee.<p>Sure, it's competitive.  Sure, some studios end up spending millions on crappy games that no one wants to play.  How is any of that different from regular, non-subscription based games?",1218903988

Yesterday's incident appears to be the result of a software malfunction in 2 or more of 4 switches that handle traffic between a group of servers and their SAN shelves. The switches are from Extreme Networks, which has a good reputation, and they are helping us debug error logs.<p>Organizationally, we are making changes to reduce the incidence of such problems and to always improve how we deal with them in the future. We're expanding the group that focuses on infrastructure design and management. This group looks at ways to improve our technology (design and vendor choices) and human processes. For instance, one of the top people in that group visited a SAN vendor earlier this week to review their latest offerings.<p>If you were affected by this downtime, please contact your account manager to discuss service credits. If you don't know your account manager, please send an email to 'info@engineyard.com' and your message will reach them.<p>Thanks for being our customer, and again, sorry for the downtime. Believe me, when I hear about downtime while on a week off with my dad coming this weekend, it is not pleasant - it actually hurts!<p>--- Lance Walley, CEO

Um, no.<p>Or at least, I think that in fact higher education is completely in step with business practices, it's just that those business practices are also outmoded. Especially the insistence that everyone work in a office (""tethered to a place""), fit into rigid hierarchies, job descriptions and roles (""the experience is closed""), sign NDAs, non-competes and closely guard intellectual property (""each student/employee is isolated though surrounded by peers"").<p>It's ironic that Deming is referenced at the end, because he was all about building quality, no matter how hard, long and laborious that is, and I think this article is all about scare tactics driving quick fixes while protecting the people in positions of power and the hierarchy they've built.

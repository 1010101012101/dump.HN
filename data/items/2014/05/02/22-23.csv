7688661,comment,7686690,7687720,1,0,zmoazeni,,,"Just throwing my voice into the chorus, I know nothing about category theory either, and I don&#x27;t think that hinders learning Haskell.<p>I do think there is a subset of Haskellers who use category theory to prove certain ideas and they are able to easily express that in code. However I haven&#x27;t found it necessary to understand the theory behind why something is sound in order to practically use their work in my projects. That says more about Haskell&#x27;s expressiveness than the target audience to me.<p>Setting aside years of imperative (and also OO) programming and learning a different approach to solving problems has been the biggest challenge for me, by far.

7688657,comment,7685083,7688551,3,0,bad_user,,,"I am very interested in F*, I heard about it and I&#x27;m waiting eagerly for something polished.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t like F#, the result, because on one hand you&#x27;ve got the Hindley-Milner type system and on the other hand you&#x27;ve got OOP with .NET generics. It resembles Ocaml in philosophy (I&#x27;m sure this wasn&#x27;t by accident), in that it feels and smells like 2 type-systems in the same language. It&#x27;s just an opinion of taste of course - but would have anybody used F# if it didn&#x27;t integrate well with .NET&#x27;s standard assemblies? So F#&#x27;s integration with .NET&#x27;s generics is very understandable and one reason Scala.NET died was because it was too hard to keep the semantics of Scala, while also integrating well with .NET, which meant the project was interesting only for people wanting to port their Scala code to .NET - for which approaches like IKVM.NET were far better options. I think somebody wrote an interesting paper on Scala and .NET&#x27;s reified generics, sadly I can&#x27;t find it right now.<p>You may have gotten annoyed about hearing this thing about .NET generics not being expressive enough - I also get annoyed hearing about how Java sucks because it doesn&#x27;t have reification for generics or other such things, when in truth the compiler can handle specialization just fine and both approaches (runtime versus compile-time) have merit and make different compromises.<p>BTW, I see that you&#x27;re working on the Roslyn team - you guys are doing great work lately.

7688645,comment,7687784,7688018,11,0,pabb,,,"As someone who actually enjoys making offensive comments in the _right context_, I can&#x27;t disagree more with you.<p>When somebody says something offensive, context is everything. If you&#x27;re in a meeting with a group of adult men that are culturally similar to you and there&#x27;s nothing pressing on the table, sure, a dick joke might be fine.<p>But in the case of the article, I think the author even let off lightly situations like the &quot;dick in the hand&quot; anecdote. It&#x27;s one thing to make an off-color joke to ease the mood when the context is appropriate, but if you&#x27;re sitting in a room with a woman, and you make a comment like that, you know for a fact you&#x27;re crossing a boundary, no matter how small it may be.<p>For some reason, it reminds me of a former (male) roommate of mine who would always make comments containing indirect sexual references in the presence of our (only) female roommate. He would never say something sexually related pertaining to her, but things like &quot;I watch too many TV shows? Nonsense. Are you calling me a whore??&quot; Shit that would be subtle enough that he could easily shrug off an accusation that he was being offensive, yet he very much knew he was trying to spin the conversation toward sex as a means of flirting.<p>I don&#x27;t think there are many excuses to be made in these contexts. If you&#x27;ve ever known your mother, or had a sister or a girlfriend who was attractive (and the recipient of suggestive comments), you know exactly what&#x27;s acceptable and what&#x27;s not. Picture it&#x27;s your girlfriend getting harassed.<p>I&#x27;m hardly the whiteknight, social-justice type whatsoever, but for fuck sake, keep business as business and play bullshit kiddie flirt games at the bar.",1399071168

It is crazy, but there are people who will believe you when you tell them this stuff is a problem in a way they won&#x27;t believe others. Ditto for proposing solutions. E.g., next time your company is looking to fill positions, try saying, &quot;Say, our pool of applicants last time wasn&#x27;t very diverse. I&#x27;d like to reach out to groups X, Y, and Z, and also a ask wider variety of people vet our job description just to make sure we aren&#x27;t giving off the wrong signals.&quot; It is much easier for a white dude to say that.<p>You can also do a lot to signal boost. Passing along stories, links, and books is one thing. (I&#x27;ll often send people to Everyday Sexism or Project Unbreakable, for example, or to particular things on the geek feminism wiki.) And if you notice non-white-male people getting shortchanged at work, do something about it. For example, I&#x27;ve heard a lot of women in tech tell stories of saying things in meetings and getting totally ignored. So be the person who says, &quot;Hey, Jane&#x27;s point is really interesting, and we went right by it. Jane, could you say that again, and maybe expand a little?&quot;<p>And you can do things right here. Among a number of groups, Hacker News is basically seen as a wretched hive of scum and villainy.

7688542,comment,7687900,7688400,2,0,gavinpc,,,"My family almost got killed once because of a bad judgement based on computer maps.<p>My wife and I were on a cross-country bike trip, with our dogs in tow.  On this particular day, we were shooting for the Chicago area and had a long way to go from Ransom, Illinois where we woke up.  There was nothing but corn, windmills, and an Air Force special training center.  But we had a friend in Oak Park, and we were determined to get there and take a rest day.<p>After following a number of scattered trails and highways, we wound up lost in a kind of industrial alcove, trying to cross one of the canals.  After a little backtracking (which is the <i>worst</i>), we stopped to ask for help from a bald guy in a pink tee shirt whom I&#x27;d noticed cycling earlier.  He was a German guy named Rolf and he apparently biked about 60 miles a day just for fun.  He told us we still had pretty far to go, and he rode with us about ten miles or so to his car, where he had a map book.  He gave us detailed directions saying exactly what would be the best and safest route.  We thanked him and went our separate ways.<p>We followed his directions until after dark (at which point we would normally have stopped).  We&#x27;d already traveled close to ninety miles that day, and were getting anxious to get off the road.  At some point, we called our friend to see if we were close.  We told her Rolf&#x27;s directions and asked if that would get us there.  She said she would look online.<p>She called us back with a different set of directions, and, figuring that she should know her own neighborhood, proceeded to follow them.  This took us onto a road that, we later learned, wound through what is essentially a wildlife refuge, and which quickly became extremely dangerous.  There were no street lights, and cars were coming around turns at high speed.  We decided to stop and barely got off the road in time to avoid being hit.  We then had to get our bikes, dogs, and trailer across the street so we could walk the path.  It was one of the scariest experiences of my life.<p>I later found out that our friend had never been on the road she recommended, and was going only by what it &quot;looked like&quot; on Google maps.  (This was 2008, by the way.)<p>So yeah, quality.  And there&#x27;s no substitute for human expertise.<p>EDIT: and yes, it was our bad judgement as well, for taking bad advice... and maybe for not having our own maps in the first place.  Although I&#x27;ve done thousands of miles of cross-country (in the US), and I think you really do have to wing it.",1399069461

Another is that the <i>woman</i> who does so harms her <i>own</i> reputation. Who the hell will want to work with her if they know that should they crack an off color joke or make some other faux pas, she will go all SJW on them and seek to publicly hang them high?<p>Women are never going to get anywhere if they continue to jump on their high horse every time they have a run in with some guy. It is the men who have power. We (women -- as I am one) have to find a way to work with them if we want to get anywhere. And learning to sidestep trouble and frame things as innocently as they are reasonably able to be framed is a path forward. Jumping to ugly conclusions and starting a shitshow every time something happens is not.<p>The author was a CEO who apparently did multi-million dollar deals. I suspect she knows whereof she speaks. The shitshows we have seen posted to HN mostly seem to be women who are less successful than that.<p>I say this as someone who was molested and raped as a kid, who talks openly about that fact and what it did to me yet I have protected the identities of the perpetrators, for quite a lot of reasons. So this is something I have firsthand experience with.<p>The other problem is that naming names tends to not let it be a growth experience for men who screwed up because they just did not know any better. We all inherit an awful lot of shit culturally (I grew up in the deep south -- here is me talking about stupid racist assumptions I did not know I had and how I became aware of them: <a href=""http://ask.metafilter.com/261222/How-can-I-practice-gratitude-while-recognizing-and-fighting-injustice#3794660"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ask.metafilter.com/261222/How-can-I-practice-gratitud...</a>) You have to start with the assumption that men are just as much a victim of circumstance as women if we are ever going to find a path forward.<p>Once you out a man, he is publicly branded. Once that is done, he is much more likely to feel compelled to justify his actions to himself. That means he is likely to keep being an asshole and not become more sensitive to the issue.

7688448,comment,7686690,7687607,6,0,sparkie,,,"An interface in OOP langs is more similar to the Existential data type which the author is trying to avoid using in this post, because it is <i>sometimes</i> seen as an anti-pattern in Haskell (although some people take this to the extreme and tell you to avoid Existentials completely).<p>If we take for example, a simple IRenderable interface<p><pre><code>    interface IRenderable {\n        void Render();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s a bit of boilerplate to add, but we can get something pretty similar in Haskell:<p><pre><code>    class Renderable a where\n      render :: a -> IO ()\n\n    data Render = forall a. Renderable a => Render a\n    instance Renderable Render where\n      render (Render a) = render a\n\n</code></pre>\nThe obvious difference between the author&#x27;s proposed solution and this OOP-style interface is the open versus closed world assumption. By having an interface, we have an open world in which we can easily add new types to render, without changing existing code - only adding new instances. In the solution proposed by the author (and the various other &quot;solutions&quot;), they break the open world assumption and fall back to a closed world - where you need to create specific types which encapsulate all the known types that can be rendered - this is demonstrated by the author&#x27;s Game and ExtendedGame types - if you need to create a new &quot;ExtendedExtendedGame&quot; type each time you add a new renderable type - this solution obviously does not scale, does it?<p>With the Existential now, we can create a list of Render, which would be similar to having a list of IRenderable in Java. We can&#x27;t do anything with the list other than call render on each item - which is almost always what we want to do anyway - so the oft-reported &quot;existential anti-pattern&quot; is usually no such thing. In fact, the claim that this is an antipattern stems from the idea that existentials are &quot;type-erasing&quot; - that you might want to convert back from a Render to a Ball for instance (or from an IRenderable to a Ball).<p>Even in Java, this would be a bad idea - it requires an explicit cast which could fail at runtime - you simply wouldn&#x27;t do such thing unless you were certain of its type, or you guarded such cast by first using the `instanceof` operator.<p><pre><code>    if (r instanceof Ball) {\n        Ball b = (Ball)r;\n        ...\n    } \n</code></pre>\nYou would not normally do this directly on each type, as you&#x27;d be back to a closed-world assumption. Instead, you&#x27;d usually create a mapping of types->functions, where you can dynamically test a type and do the relevant action, and you can continue to add new items to the map.<p>In the event we do want a list of renderable items, and we don&#x27;t want to lose type information - Haskell can also provide a similar type-cast to the one you&#x27;d use in Java - it&#x27;s rightly called `unsafeCoerce` because it is unsafe - as is the Java version, which throws a ClassCastException when used incorrectly.<p>If we modify the existential data type to also include type information, via Haskell&#x27;s Data.Typeable module, we can encapsulate the bad behavior of unsafeCoerce, and ensure that we only expose a safe version - one that returns &quot;Maybe x&quot; instead of &quot;x, but may fail&quot;.<p><pre><code>    {-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-}\n\n    module X.Render (\n        Render,\n        toRender,\n        fromRender\n        ) where\n        \n    import Data.Typeable\n    import Unsafe.Coerce\n\n    data Render = forall a. (Typeable a, Renderable a) => Render TypeRep a\n\n    instance Renderable Render where\n        render (Render _ a) = render a\n\n    toRender :: (Typeable a, Renderable a) => a -> Render\n    toRender a = Render (typeOf a) a\n\n    fromRender :: (Typeable a, Renderable a) => Render -> Maybe a\n    fromRender (Render t a) =\n      case unsafeCoerce a of x | t == typeOf x -> Just x\n                               | otherwise -> Nothing\n</code></pre>\nYou can even go as far as emulating Java&#x27;s instanceof operator (althought not quite the same - it doesn&#x27;t handle subtyping), just create a function instanceof in a typeclass, and use it as an infix operator.<p><pre><code>    class InstanceOf a where\n        instanceOf :: a -> TypeRep -> Bool\n        \n    instance InstanceOf Render where\n        instanceOf (Render tReal _) tWanted | tReal == tWanted = True\n        instanceOf _ _ = False\n\n    ...\n\n    (toRender Ball) `instanceOf` (typeOf Ball) == True</code></pre>",1399068237

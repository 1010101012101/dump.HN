This is what we came up with. We spent a few hours searching for similar projects and found nothing, and it would have been impractical to get in touch with every maintainer of every SCM to see if they were working on a feature like revsets.<p>We used Mercurial for two reasons: it is distributed, and it has a great hook API. There was no traffic on the mailing list that would have hinted to us that revsets were on the way. As far as I can tell, Matt Mackall himself was just as uncommunicative as we were. The only place I can find revsets mentioned prior to their introduction in Mercurial 1.6 was a mailing list post where he announced them, fully baked and implemented. Can we be expected to be more involved with the community than the primary maintainer of the project?<p>Anyway, we never felt comfortable with sharing our work that had a nonzero probability of becoming vaporware. We only recently realized that the ideas themselves might be worth something to others, and this is our way of introducing ourselves to the community. I haven't rejoined the Mercurial mailing list yet simply because I have been busy with work and it keeps slipping my mind, but I do want to get plugged in with them.",1280350523

If your product focus on that niche - great, consider it in your technical setup.<p>After attending a horrible freelance project as a ruby/rails guy in 2009 I finally made a decision for all of my hopefully upcoming projects:<p>*   focus on the early adopters who may understand your product without a big introduction. these people usually have the best and modern browsers available.<p>*   optimize for Safari/Mac, Firefox and maybe Chrome<p>*   optimize only for iPhone<p>*   <i></i>forget the rest until you have 100 paying customers.

They're saying ""can the act.""<p>Perhaps some people who use big words are putting on a show, but that's far from universal.  Big words stay in our language because they convey subtly different meanings than their simpler synonyms.  But there's a trade-off between being precise and being easily understood, and to get it right, you really need to know your audience.  A lot of people hear ""you sound too smart"" because they're going over their audience's heads.<p>I get this a lot - I come from an articulate, educated family, and I was brought up using big words. I think in big words and long sentences.  I read lots of books.  So I have to consciously simply my sentence structure and my vocabulary around most people.  It's not necessarily that they're ""not smart.""  It's just that they're used to simpler words and structure.<p>It's almost as if we speak subtly different dialects.  I have to do the work to translate, so that they don't have to.  Most people haven't read many books, and don't think in big words.  People usually talk to similar people, so they may not even have a mental concept for this translation.  But they know and notice when someone's unusually hard to understand.<p>Now, if you use bigger words than your audience, and you're also subtly condescending (because you think you're smarter, e.g.), people often assume you're trying to ""sound smart,"" even though you're actually bad at communication and lack self-awareness.  The same thing happens when you use lots of jargon and acronyms, only that alienates an even wider group of people.<p>edit: formatting",1280350141

That was pleasant for a while - they knew my name and drink and I knew their names. But after a while the ""relationship"" hit a wall. We had exhausted the possibilities for superficial chit-chat, and had to either advance to actual friendship or acknowledge that we weren't going to.<p>But the coffee shop staff wouldn't do either of those things. They can't become after-work friends with <i>all</i> their regular customers - nobody has time for that - and in many cases it could be construed as rude or unprofessional. On the other hand, they couldn't really abandon the ""relationship"" that they'd work so hard to build in the first place. It became obvious that this wasn't a real relationship, but a deliberate sales strategy. It would have been fine if they had settled for, ""Hi Colin, the usual?"" and left it at that, but they insisted on asking about my weekend, wishing me a good afternoon etc. That became annoying and I started avoiding the place.<p>The article deals with attempts by large corporations to build customer relationships, but I think the notion that customers don't <i>want</i> relationships applies even at a small scale. Real interpersonal relationships take a bit of work to maintain, and I think customers will avoid that if the relationship provides no value to them.",1280349728

The reason why the attitude tiring is because medical issues have been handled very badly in the last few years. To be honest, it might also be that I started paying more attention to it in those few years and it has always been handled badly.<p>My point is that it's becoming really hard for an average person today to decide how to react to information from medical field. Every now and then there's a report of a ""new study"" which ""concludes"" this or that about some disease or condition or disorder. More often than not, the study is not really a study but a theory, or it's not sound for this or that reason, or it's not new, or it doesn't really conclude anything yet, etc. Plus, on top of it, you get stuff like that whole fiasco with vaccines.<p>What I'm driving at is that the way this stuff is handled makes it really hard for ordinary people like me to make decisions.

So rather than aggressively limit the amount of virtual address space that each process can use, it simply only keeps a subset of that memory in physical memory at any one time.<p>You can have virtual memory without paging, but then each process has to compete for a <i>very</i> limited resource. You can also have paging without virtual memory - process A's copy of physical address X can be swapped out to be replaced with process B's copy. However processes are then still limited by having only as large an address space as physical memory in the machine, and virtual memory is such a huge win for hiding the layout of physical memory from processes as well as isolating them from one another (so no corruption possibilities) that it's pretty much unheard of to do this.<p>You get such a big advantage from having a layer of indirection sometimes...",1280349668

It's a nice world when you can stack 64GB in a box and never worry about disk, but having worked on systems that need more working set than this, I don't think this idea actually scales up as well as is claimed.<p>Two issues:\n1. Small objects aren't batched by a VM, so they can't be combined into long streaming writes and reads. Doing 4k writes and reads is useless on a modern disk. 128k to 1MB is more appropriate if you can organize things that way.<p>2. If your workload ""mostly"" fits in RAM, and then as your application scales, the working set exceeds RAM, you wind up doing some queries that are instant, and some that are a million times slower (a real, uncached disk seek). Unless you plan for this, your app can fall over and you just won't  know what happened. You need to know the fraction of requests that will go to disk and plan to have spindles (or RAM) to handle it. I don't like systems that make measuring what's going on at this level any harder to do.<p>The author's claim is that you get to share RAM with the VM, which is great, but in practice a lot of systems use kernel-supported sendfile() to do work (i.e. have a small streaming buffer per network connection), or cache super-hot objects in a relatively small amount of RAM. The assumption that all user-mode caches try to allocate as much RAM as possible is not true.<p>Alternately, larger systems separate RAM cache entirely from disk-bound boxes (e.g., dedicated memcached).<p>I think a more complete treatment of this problem would explain scaling over working set more aggressively, and it would explain using instrumentation how the system degrades at scale.",1280348891

The real problem is string searching and concise data gathering syntax, which is what we are focusing on.<p>In the case of Fossil, it may be possible to access the backend directly and do any selects or joins at that level. While it would be nice to access the data for any system with SQL, for instance, those languages are not suited for working with graph-oriented data, and so the implementation choice comes down to writing a language that transforms user queries into different forms for each system, or writing a language that accesses some underlying database that the repository data has been translated into.<p>We had been taking the latter approach, but the entrance of revsets pushes us neatly into the former approach. We still have our code to do all the data scraping, so we could use it for example with svn or git (which also has its own subgraph selection mechanism).<p>There also remains the fact that since we are students, we sometimes like to implement things just for the hell of it.

This is a non-trivial process: on-die caches get flushed, virtual memory has to get re-mapped, registers re-loaded.  This is by definition lost time, time the OS is spent not doing your workload.  If the number of context switches gets too large, a system is spending an inordinate amount of time performing context switches, and less time doing ""real work"" inside threads.  You cite two isues, slow and not scaling.<p>Second, memory usage.  Each thread has its own stack space, which consumes a fixed memory size.<p>As to ""slow"" and ""does not scale;"" slow is relative; the amount of time spent context switching is very dependent on a variety of workload factors.  Threading _can_ be slow.  Scaling, on the other hand, is less unequivocal.  A quarter million active threads, each doing very little, is not a good thing: too much memory, too many context switches, and too high a latency.<p>The problem is not threading per se.  It's pre-emptive multi-threading, where a programs state is transparently pulled from the CPU by the OS and serialized to someplace else, and another programs state is de-serialized and loaded in transparent; that is, without the loaded or unloaded program knowing.  Erlang and tasklets are examples of userspace or lightweighs threads where pre-emption is not permitted, and the context switching penalty is negligible.    Instead of threads being ignorant, and being preemptively swapped in and out, they are coordinated and actively yield themselves back to the scheduler, thereby reducing the context switching penalty.",1280347641

Now we're starting to see worker's discontent again, it's focused on boogeymen, immigrants and liberals for now, but it'll make it's way back to employers eventually.",1280347270

Flowshark represents the pre-UI stage of planning out an app, and as such I'm doing my best to make the screen elements as devoid as possible of distracting eye candy.  The focus is always on the flow.",1280347247

There was no Hacker News code proper, because I accidentally <i>named</i> the discount hackernews01, and then forgot to fill in the code field with the actual code. Happily, despite the scary warning, E-Junkie's default behavior when this happens is to automatically apply any discounts with a missing code field—which in this case was the very discount whose code didn't work!<p>It's fixed now, and the discount code should work without any frightening JavaScript popups.<p>By the way, this is why I always monitor the Hacker News comments obsessively whenever I launch something. You guys rock!",1280347215

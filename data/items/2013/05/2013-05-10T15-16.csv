People refer to adoption by saying they're ""not really your"" kids: I am not sure why. They really and truly are my brothers.<p>You cannot choose your immediate emotional responses but you can choose your overall outlook. Your overall outlook colors those emotional responses; a peaceful mind handles stresses and uncertainties much better than an anxious one. Thus, don't assume that there exists only one perspective on truth, but search for the perspectives that make life easier.<p>The now is all there is. You can't daydream your life away in the past or the future. In that sense: really experience this moment. However, all of your ideas have been done better by geniuses in days long past, in histories which did not become our particular present. In that sense, the present is overwhelming you with details which are not essential. So don't forget to practice history and have an outlook on the future. Just don't live in those places.<p>If I ever find myself frustrated with someone else, it's usually because they are doing something which I myself am guilty of doing. I think we often get mad at our own sins seen in other peoples' acts. Adopt this stranger as your brother, and that stranger as your sister.<p>You have a thousand bad _____ which must come out before the good work will start coming out.

Complaints of ""hard"" and ""a lot of effort"" belies how incredibly <i>rich</i> this society is, that the notion of just making pasta or growing vegetables is somehow prohibitively difficult - not because it's inherently so hard, but because we're so used to ""swipe a card, get a meal"" at all levels of society. Even if you're officially ""poor"", just be at WalMart at midnight on EBT recharge day and walk out with convenience foods. For most of humanity through most of history, what so many today belittle as ""hard"" was ""normal"" on a daily basis.<p>On my ""A Buck A Plate"" blog I've addressed various forms of this complaint. Difficulty? boil some water, open a few cans, spaghetti dinner done. Cost of cooking system (stove, gas, etc.)? grandma's ancient cast-iron frying pan over burning wood scraps in the back yard, make a nice veggies-and-shrimp stir fry. No cooking space indoors or out? $4 crock-pot and an electrical outlet. Cooking your own meals? c'mon, it's not that hard, really. Shopping for inexpensive? look at every price tag in the store (Walmart, Aldi) and discount everything over $1 per pound. Appliances? thrift shops overflow with them dirt cheap. Dried items? throw 'em in water before going to work, ready to cook when you return. Planning meals in advance? you <i>really</i> have an issue with this?<p>Sure convenience foods are popular. You also <i>pay</i> for that convenience: instead of doing the work yourself, you work doing other things then exchange the money earned there. Do more yourself, and there's less need to be out doing other things.<p>Don't confuse ""you have to <i>do</i> something"" with ""hard to do and requires a lot of effort"".

It may happen that some books have an intersection, even though they complement each other -- usually the authors try to be self-contained.<p>Also, most of the books I mentioned have about 50% dedicated to core ideas in the field and 50% dedicated to some specific tools that may not be that useful to you. More often than not the second 50% is the latter part of the book, but in say Concrete Mathematics it is spread throughout the book entirely. I know it's hard to find the balance between reading fast (and then realizing you don't remember anything from the basic tools and you can't even apply them well) and reading slow (and realizing you're trying to memorize some obscure recurrence involving binomial coefficients). Reading is hard.<p>Now, for the tips for the CS/discrete math students among you. Feel free to add some of yours, I'm hardly the veteran educator here.<p><i>Knuth, Graham, Patashnik's Concrete Mathematics</i>, after a few chapters, goes well with <i>Flajolet, Sedgewick's Analytic Combinatorics</i>.

As for the graph theory books I read, I liked <i>Bondy, Murty's Graph Theory</i> style the most, so I'd probably go with that, though I haven't really read them in parallel yet.<p>For the discrete math students out there, after learning the basics of probablistic method (<i>Alon, Spencer's Probabilistic Method</i> being the seminal textbook, I think), you could continue with both some probabilistic algorithm book to apply what you've learned in CS (I did take a course in that, though, so I can't vouch for the best book out there) and you could also grab <i>Tao, Vu's Additive Combinatorics</i> for how to apply probability in number theory (probabilistic method is chapter one in there).",1368199831

There is a chance though that such a person may exist though.<p>Take ""Worrying about your health"", I think ""worrying"" here means ""being anxious"". So while normal health-conscious person cares about her/his health(eats well, sleeps well, takes necessary prescribed medications, etc), she/he isn't anxious about it. In contrast, depressed person may worry about her or his health without taking any actual steps to improve the situation.<p>Or take ""Criticizing yourself or blaming yourself""(note second yourself, this question in kindle book is different, maybe I need to prepare correct pdf). If you spend your whole week under pressure of self-criticism, thinking about every mistake you made and every imperfection your work have, however small or large, then this is definitely 4. ""Somewhat perfectionistic"" is 1 in my book. 4 is ""Extremely perfectionistic"".<p>Or ""Loss of interest in sex""? Why would an exteme loss of sex drive happen to a normal person?",1368198299

I was not overly active and bordering on totaly inactive.  I slept lots as well.  In short I eat almost twice the ` so called` reccomended calorie amount.  I had nothing like worms or the sort and over a 2 week period I lost over a stone in weight.  \n    Now I'm large frame, over 6feet tall and male and a active brain yet was phsicaly inactive, eating twice the so called daily calorie intake and had no medical issues like worms or digestive issue at all and I lost weight.\n    In short my my personal calorie intake is over twice what the so called average is and when I read articles like this it is hard not to feel persecuted as other read them, take them as fact and then think you are wrong.  Yet the facts show, as well as common sence that not everybody is the same.<p>The acticale on the BBC was born out of benifit cuts and was showing how somebody could eat cheaply, it totaly ignores that a even the `so called` average daily intake is 2000 for a women and 2500 for a man and that men and women are paid the same amounts, with that most of the replies and posted menu's came from small frame short people and females (no offence intended btw).  With that I'm jelous I'm not a small female and able to eat less to lead the same quality of life.  Sadly that is not so and that is te case for many people.  We are all different and there is no cookie-cutter way to say this will sort everybody as it won't, or shoe shops would have shoes the same size and that would be it for everybody.<p>What I find worrying is the mentality that some people have and wil impose based upon this and what might be good for them is not good for others and they will not know any better as the `reccomended intake` gets bastardised from being average to the normal for all.<p>That said, not everybody has a garden to grow their own vegtables and that helps hugely, sadly I can't but we all have windows and a small window ledge herb garden can help loads.<p>I would also say baking your own bread helps as well on many levels.<p>Beyond that your down to mapping out what time what supermarkets reduce items, keeping it to yourself and playing hit and miss that others not in the same situation as you as there are only so many reduced items.<p>I have found you can eat cheaply, or you can eat healthy, but as a non vegan/vegatarian it is extreemly depressing.",1368198275

There is the branch of applied math, and I'm sure they get funding more easily.<p>But there are also mathematicians (cited several times in the comments here) who see math as art and want to do it for its own sake.<p>And it has happened quite often that these ""pure"" mathematicians came up with enirely new stuff that only afterwards (and without anyone foreseeing it) turned out to be useful in modelling physical processes. Even among mathematicians you sometimes find that you can prove something in one field by using constructs and theorems from an entirely different field that nobody thought was in any way related.

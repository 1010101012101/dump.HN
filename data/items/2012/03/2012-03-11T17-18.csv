""Should"" not take more time than:<p><pre><code>  y[i] = y[i] + 0.1;

The justice system is already crashing, from being underfunded.<p>"""""" cuts already imposed on the Los Angeles Superior Court, if unabated, will force the closure of over 180 courtrooms and layoffs of more than 1800 employees in the coming years. This is a dramatic reduction in work force and courtrooms. There are approximately 605 courtrooms operating throughout 50 locations in Los Angeles County. The closure of 180 courtrooms includes the closure of nine courthouses. The loss of 1800 employees constitutes a 34 percent reduction in the courts workforce. The cuts in staff and courtrooms/courthouses (along with the priority given to criminal cases) will result in an increase to the already existing backlog of cases, which, in turn, will slow the movement of virtually all civil cases to a snails pace.""

The cleverly named article at <a href=""http://copperthoughts.com/p/clojure-io-p1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://copperthoughts.com/p/clojure-io-p1</a> is over a year old, so I don't know if things have changed, but it suggests that besides the slurp function (which appears as impractical from a memory standpoint as the Perl equivalent), you really do need to dip into Java for I/O.<p>Assuming it's just a matter of time before I/O and all other common tasks in Clojure are done in native Clojure, it really seems like a contender for the pg ""hundred year language.""  It has lots of default macro shortcuts for common tasks and really seems to prefer abstracting away redundancy to following tradition.  It even uses the Arc-style let macro instead of the paren-happy one found in Scheme and CL.  It also makes concurrency almost as simple as pg's ""Bring Back Moore's Law"" startup idea.  And it's also well suited to web applications.  The more I think about, the more it really does seem to be the Arc that's already here.",1331488491

I figure since it works for me, I could try and sell this to a different industry/niche - in this case 'hosting'. This tool currently does not have an UI - I run sql queries directly on the mysql server to get my information. I have created a mockup UI to show how I expect it to work.<p>UI for explaining the app functionality - http://axemantech.com/HostingSEO/<p>Pain point it solves: Currently there are many seo apps that show serp rankings, on page and off page seo stats but seting up the system is generally painful. I dislike having to add keywords for my website, add data for my competitors, etc. This generally happens because these SEO apps are generic.<p>How to solve this: Since this app focuses on a specific niche, it will already be setup with all the potential keywords for the niche (and will continously add new ones). All the data that the customers (people performing seo for hosting companies) want would already be in the system. A customer would only sign up with his domain(s) and the app would show him his serp rankings, onpage and offpage details about the SEO for his web pages and his competitors.<p>The reason I chose the 'hosting' industry is because its one of the industries with the costliest adwords cpc - which means that a small change in ranking could be potentially very large savings for the companies. I am however open to other niches (especially ones that are not saturated)<p>I have been a technical guy for 10 years and find it quite hard to change my mindset to that of a business guy. All my questions are related to the business side.<p>My questions:<p>1. Does this sound like a good idea?<p>2. How else can I add value by specializing for a niche industry?<p>3. How would one figure out the best industry for this?<p>4. How would one figure out the market size for a specific industry?<p>5. What's the best way to get the initial users to help build this?

No, I don't mean scaring them about predators, but informing them that (unfortunately) people, jobs and police can and will use what you say online against you. As you say, this isn't their diary.<p>Parents - They should parent. In the modern times that means educating children about the internet and expected behavior online. Teach your kids about privacy settings. If needed, regulate access to digital devices. I'm sure (most) 13 year olds aren't buying their own cell phones, computers and internet access.<p>Kids are rough on each other, but they've <i>always</i> been rough on each other. The only difference now is that its a larger audience and more to interact with.<p>Kids need to know that they can simply 'opt out' if they want to and stuff gets too socially complex. They don't need to have a Facebook profile that's 100% public to every other kid in school. They could have a very locked and and private profile, or no profile at all.",1331486447

(You can probably use some subjective measures here like happiness generated from fantasy.) In the case of reading to enrich your knowledge in a particular field you ask an important subset of that question: <i>What is the chance that this book will, even in conjunction with other books, have a significant impact on my ability to work in my chosen field versus the chance that if I went and started one of my projects right now I would succeed?</i><p>Theres more than one project I have right now for which I've said ""Nope, need to do more reading."".",1331485859

It's not that the web is massively good at deployment, it's just that everyone else is so bad at it that the web wins despite being worse as an app dev platform in almost every other aspect.<p>This is what the web does right that OS's get wrong: cross-platform development without any vendor lock-in (not even dev tools lock-in), no installation required before using an app, no permission grants required before using an app, implicitly up-to-date without restarting the app (every click has the potential to load an updated feature), highly granular downloading of features on-demand (downloading the behavior behind every click as you are working, which is crazy when you think about it), and secure and reliable distributed computing. The only thing it gets wrong is offline support (HTML5 appcache doesn't cut it).<p>So, right now as a developer you can build your apps on a platform that gets deployment right (the web), or one that gets app development right (native).

3690661,comment,3690411,3690411,4,0,intenex,,,"Much better than the alternative (all consumption, zero production), but still not quite ideal in my personal experience. A two-phase approach is better - first comes the dead-zone, which is getting from boot-camp to the front-line. Sad as it is, you can't just jump straight into everything. I tried that when I first started learning to code, and I hit the same experience as you with JS - constant fallback on StackOverflow. Extremely frustrating since progress was unnecessarily slow and I didn't understand the fundamental philosophies behind the coding process and structure.<p>My current approach which is presently proving fantastic (we'll see where it goes) is to 1. bust through the dead-zone with brute force (I nicknamed it the dead-zone because it's precisely that for me - I can't get passionate enough to crank through it without imposing a strict regimen of study because it's not a project I can own and challenge myself with) and 2. get to working on a concrete personal/work project asap. Once I'm on the project I become obsessive and learn rapidly how all the pieces fit together - but that initial phase of consumption is invaluable for broad grasp of the subject at hand and understanding how all the pieces integrate into a whole.<p>That said, the ideal circumstance is that you're able to produce piecemeal as you progress through the initial consumption phase as well - Learn Python the Hard Way is a great example that's worked very well personally as an intro to Python, precisely because of its piecemeal hands-on approach. The Django Book tutorial is a nice counterexample - had to rush through that one so I could begin a project and incorporate what I'd learned before I forgot it as there were significantly fewer opportunities for incremental imprinting of acquired knowledge. It wasn't a bad experience, as I did manage to get through it in time before I lost the majority of what I'd learn, but that kind of consumptive material is severely limited by time - if you find yourself forced to consume something like that, get through it as <i>fast</i> as you can and start producing whenever you feel your knowledge slipping away.<p>TL;DR Consume a bit as fast as you can then produce",1331485451

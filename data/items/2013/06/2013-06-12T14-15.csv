5868414,comment,5867829,5868091,2,0,yardie,,,"> marrying an American, she was told that if she goes to France to have a wedding ceremony that she would not be allowed back in to America.<p>My cursory reading of the USCIS website tells me her fiance would need to apply for a K1,K3 visa. Being married she is entitled to rights the typical J visa holder does not have.<p>This is where the immigrant/nonimmigrant visa process breaks down. USCIS makes it painfully expensive to change a nonimmigrant visa into an immigrant visa. I guess what they want to avoid is having people jump the greencard queue, and marriage moves you right to the top, by flying in on a tourist visa, find a willing US citizen to marry.",1371049191

On top of that, there could be systems put into place that automate the taxes and make the current way of doing taxes a thing of the past. The lower taxes and the automated system could make it easy to pay taxes as well as harder to avoid paying taxes.",1371047890

They&#x27;ve been trying to make up for it by both offering more cores/threads than comparably priced Intel components, as well as trying to scale their clock rates. Unfortunately for AMD, their last few generations have actually been falling short on their attempts to boost clock rates, as a result, when comparing comparably priced AMD and Intel chips, while AMD would typically have a clock speed advantage, it would often not be enough to overcome Intel&#x27;s efficiency.<p>This product release is kind of an attempt to show that AMD can actually deliver on their planned strategy.<p>As for why AMD is going for this route, rather than trying to beat Intel in per clock efficiency?

It&#x27;s &quot;baseline&quot; performance is probably something like 4GHz or something (pulling out of my ass). The Max Turbo refers to that using their thermal management system, they can peak at least one of their cores to 5GHz for some period of time.

5868130,comment,5864189,5866410,2,0,616c,,,"To you it may be tangential, but my large amount of time in the Middle East (and I happen to like it here) has taught me that, unfortunately, stateless states should implode on themselves.  They will anyway.  The only reason they are able to cause damage is we shorten our proximity to them with forward operating bases and less legitimate covers in countries where the population does not approve of our presence, even nominally.  That dislike is because of those very same FOBs, which are there to make the stateless stateful.<p>If we can learn anything from networking jokes, no amount of guns will make UDP TCP, just like forcing Yemenis to accept legitimacy based on your definition of the need for stateful intervention to prevent stateless chaos and terrorism (the biggest fad word of the decade) and will not work (I would not be surprised, knowing my history of ancient Greece, if the terrain and disconnected government are not so uncommon, see Afghanistan also).<p>I agree on the should-can dichotomy.  The problem is that I was under the impression the should was important in the betterment of society than the can, and that has recently changed.  But maybe because I was raised by lawyers, I was taught the should was more important the can, hence the idea of constitutional powers.  I am under the impression that is the outrage with PRISM/FISA/general government malfeasance these days: like a cop who badgers someone he pulls over and does not follow his legal obligations, the USG in Yemen, in signals intelligence, in everything to be honest, does what it can and worries about the should later, and will find any excuse in the should category that is exceptional to justify a &quot;can&quot; they knew to be a &quot;cannot.&quot;  It is disgusting.<p>It is ok: my time abroad taught me all governments are shams, and we best tolerate them just to make them pleased with themselves.  The USG is like all other bullies, and any government bully must be convinced in its total allegiance of the flock or it must (can) flex its muscle even though it knows it should not.  Unfortunately when the bully beats too many people, they gang up and trounce on him.<p>Sorry, end rant.  Not meant to be directed at you.

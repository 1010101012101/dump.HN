5646154,comment,5644880,5644880,6,0,just2n,,,"Before looking at the benchmark results, I took a glance at the Node source and I expected it to perform worse than it did previously. It does almost universally. Not only haven't the glaring perf issues remained since round 1, it's added more. In the real world, when you look at a metric that says your req/s is a bottleneck, which is what this benchmark is loosely simulating, you'd fix it. You wouldn't just say ""nope, that's what this framework does, sorry boss.""<p>I still don't find these benchmarks very useful. From the looks of the comments, a lot of you don't really either (even if you don't realize it).<p>For example, a lot of people in these comments want to correlate language speed with performance in these benchmarks, by arguing specific examples, but comparing almost any two frameworks/platforms in this ""benchmark"" is an apples to non-apples comparison, and the result is actually full of counter examples (faster languages performing more poorly). That should instantly tell you that this benchmark isn't telling you what you think it's telling you, and that you haven't really derived any value from it.<p>Perhaps the biggest reason I don't find value here is that every product here does wildly different things. It's like comparing wrenches to hammers to screwdrivers to 3D printers.<p>I also want to point out to people who say that this is a ""comparison"" of frameworks that it is emphatically <i>not</i> a comparison. What is the value of a framework? Is it speed? Atypically. And this ""benchmark"" tends to point at such cases as ""being better"" because they do better in this specific task. A framework/platform's value lies in features and abstractions. This does not compare those.<p>I will gladly build a ""framework"" in NodeJS that is only capable of doing the tasks in this benchmark as fast and with as little overhead as possible. You would <i>NEVER</i> use it in the real world, but it would be a beast at serializing JSON and making repeated database queries in an insecure fashion.

5646143,comment,5644456,5645416,1,0,jonhmchan,,,"OP here. You're right - what I'm proposing is not directly human readable, but I don't think that means the use of SLOPE is delegated for extraordinary or scientific use cases alone. I am certainly thinking about it as a way between different technologies to talk to one another. The ISO representation of time, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ, is certainly far more human readable than a series of unix timestamps S;L;O;P;E. However, this is where the advantage stops - especially for the developer who has to parse and manipulate the ISO string.<p>Take incrementing the timestamp by one day, for example. Intuition would direct you to split the ISO string into it's components, increment the DD data, and reconstruct it. However, it's far more complicated than that: months have different numbers of days, and it would require modifying both MM and DD if so (leap years taken into account too). You may need to increment the year as well if DD==12. Something this simple shouldn't be so difficult. Most languages have standard libraries that contain methods to handle these complexities, but it's a nightmare to deal with different protocols for each to do so. With SLOPE, the point in time can be incremented easily without confusion: add 60<i>60</i>24 (86400) to the ""start.""<p>I'm probably going to make a follow-up post to address this one issue (it's a big one). With some code, I think it becomes more clear.<p>As for the seasons and Gregorian point...well...",1367517373

5646128,comment,5625620,5637882,1,0,kragen,,,"I agree that learning about threaded interpretive languages is important, despite the fact you allude to that Forth compilers (at least those I'm familiar with) produce deeply suboptimal code.<p>I agree that writing in a high-level language is faster — quite aside from the availability of library functionality like hash tables and heaps and PNG decoders and whatnot, you have less code to write and to read, and less fiddly decisions about register assignment and memory allocation to make, possibly get wrong, and have to debug.<p>But that difference is a constant factor — it's not going to be even 1000, and it's never going to approach ""many orders of magnitude"", which was the nonsense claim I took most issue with.  (Two or three isn't ""many"" in my vocabulary.)  Typically I think it's about 10 to 30, which is nothing to sneeze at in the real world, but which would be insignificant compared to your absurd earlier claims.<p>You <i>can</i> get a ""many orders of magnitude"" boost — rarely — from libraries or static checking.  Neither of these is Forth's strong suit.<p>Nested state machines are actually an interesting case — often by far the most convenient way to write them is with one thread per state machine. C by itself doesn't give you the tools to do that predictably, because you can't tell how much stack space you're going to need — it depends on your compiler and compilation options; assembly and Forth do.  So it's one of the rare things that might actually be easier to do in assembly than in C.  (But if you have some memory to spare, maybe setcontext() is plenty good enough.)",1367517238

We'd simply up our rates by 20%, then start offering a 20% commission on the initial sale, and 10% residual commissions of future work to anybody that could close a sale.<p>I thought it was a dumb idea at the time, because who in their right mind would work for free?  Turns out, a LOT of people.  We got far more interest than we'd ever had, and ended up having to scale the business really quickly to keep up with the sales guy.  Later, we expanded the idea to just offering a flat 10% finders fee for non-employees that just wanted to bring us work.  After word of that spread, it was nearly impossible to keep up with all the work coming in.<p>In short, that's a really long way around to say that there's probably nothing fishy with the offer.  Of course, if you're selling a product that retails for $20, it's probably not going to work out, but if your average sale is over $10,000 or so, it makes sense.  For people who sell things in batches of millions (Oracle, EMC, Cisco, etc.), their sales people get salaries, sure, but it's a hugely commission driven business (which is why the sales people always seem to end up selling features that don't exist that engineers have to scramble to implement).",1367517195

The ramifications are that we can't offer the same level of isolation as Erlang, at least not on HotSpot. An actor could theoretically produce a particular kind of garbage that will cause a GC pause to the entire system.

You're correlating national headquarters with start-up success, and then claiming this says something about tax rates.<p>The fact that US tax rates have themselves varied over time and place is counterevidence against your claim!

The site was sold by Agfa Corporation, with headquarters in New Jersey.<p>The 15.69-acre laboratory site, known as Wardenclyffe, is where Tesla planned his wireless communications and energy transmission tower, in the early 1900s. He was never able to complete the construction of the tower due to lack of funds.\nAt the end of August 2012, Friends of Science East, Inc. partnered with online comic Matthew Inman (TheOatmeal.com) to hold an online crowd funding campaign on Indiegogo.com in which they were able to raise $1.37 million towards saving the Wardenclyffe site. Over 33,000 people from 108 countries contributed to the success of the campaign, which reached the $1 million mark in just over a week.<p>“This is a major milestone in our almost two-decade effort to save this historically and scientifically significant site. We have been pursuing this dream with confidence that we would eventually succeed,” said Gene Genova, Vice President of the organization. “We are very excited to be able to finally set foot on the grounds where Tesla walked and worked.”\n“Now begin the next important steps in raising the money needed to restore the historic laboratory,” said Mary Daum, treasurer. “We estimate that we will need to raise about $10 million to create a science learning center and museum worthy of Tesla and his legacy. We invite everyone who believes in science education and in recognizing Tesla for his many contributions to society to join in helping to make this dream a reality.”<p>The organization plans several fundraising events in the future. More information can be found on the website (www.TeslaScienceCenter.org), at the Facebook page (Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe), and via Twitter (@teslascience).<p>Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit corporation in the state of New York, dedicated to saving and restoring Wardenclyffe, and transforming it into a science learning center and museum.",1367516391

It's especially rewarding to hear that people have gleaned value from the project.<p>You're precisely right about how to put this data to use: as one point in a holistic decision making process.  We address that in the Questions section of the site, in fact.  That said, we are not reducing each framework to a single performance number.  Our goal is to measure the performance of several key components of modern frameworks: database abstraction and connection pool performance, JSON serialization, list and collection functions, and server-side templates.  We'd like to add even more computationally-intensive request types in future rounds.<p>So, no, we're not testing your (or anyone else's) specific application on each framework.  But we are testing functions that your application is likely to use.  You're still better off measuring the performance of your use-case on candidate frameworks before you start work, but perhaps you can first trim the field to a manageable number.<p>In the first round, we echoed your surprise at the spread--four orders of magnitude!  I think the shifting winds of opinion come from the fact that today's high-performance languages, platforms, frameworks are <i>not necessarily</i> more cumbersome to use for development than the old guard.  As others have pointed out elsewhere in this thread, Go is not a terribly verbose language, and yet its performance is fantastic.<p>Has the era of sacrificing performance at the altar of developer efficiency ended?  I'm not sure.  But we have some data to add to the conversation.",1367516384

I like to think we're at a pretty good balance between startup and big company.<p>We're currently hiring ""Ruby on Rails Developer, Integrations Engineer, Front End Developer, UX Designer, Visual Designer"", but imho we're mostly in need of full stack devs. This company is growing very very very quickly, and flexible developers who can wear many hats are the best for that<p>We're in downtown San Mateo, 1 block from Caltrain. REMOTES, H1Bs, TNs (I am one! from Canada eh?) are all ok. Competitive pay, 401k, health insurance. WFH privileges, flex time, all that good stuff. An unlimited PTO system.  And as a personal anecdote: I've experienced almost no overtime here, and virtually no pressure to overwork myself. Coupa respects a healthy work-life balance.  There's a lot of room for self-management here; work the way you work best, show results, and you'll be given the freedom to do it however you like.<p>If anyone is interested, mail me at tim.herd @ coupa.com, paste your resume, github link, maybe a cover letter if you're feeling generous :D.

It's not always appropriate, but it has its place when it's done right.<p>In this case, there's a cassette tape, which is not itself an interface, but a storage medium. Unless the user mouses over the cassette, there are no controls visible at all. Once revealed, the hidden controls turn out to be simply a set of traditional play and seek buttons, albeit oddly arranged (I'm not sure why the play button is backwards). It took some experimentation on my part to learn that clicking the cassette itself also toggles playback, and that clicking on the label reveals a hidden input field.<p>One of the biggest criticisms of ""flat UI"" is the lack of visual affordances that show users what is clickable, and what it should do. This ersatz ""skeuomorphic"" interface has the missing affordances of a flat UI, without the trendy design.<p>I guess it's funny, but I would had more fun if it had gone all the way, such as re-creating a classic cassette deck, or a Walkman, or something.",1367515806

Firstly, in the mid-to-late 90s, Java was really was slow and back then C/C++ application layers were pretty common (perl if you could get away with it). So initially Java did not compare well, which is why we wasted a couple years on applets. Even as late as 2005 at Amazon, there were many people predicting doom when we introduced the first Java service as a dependency of the home page. Secondly, the early Java web frameworks were highly synchronous, with lots of locking, and there was no evented IO. So sites written that way really were dogs.<p>Although I hope to never write ""public static void main"" again (except ironically, of course), and I spend some time dabbling in Python/Ruby/obscure-language land, I'm really happy to see Clojure and Scala doing well here.",1367515146

Roughly, using this dialect, you could build a program that would randomly branch at various points, then keep only the cases of the program that matched some property, and ask what the probabilities were for some other property over those cases.  I think the keyword was rejection-query but the first page of Google doesn't turn up the desired result for that.",1367514225

It seems like the whole ""freedom"" concept that undergirded the PC and Internet revolutions has been absolutely forgotten.<p>Again I ask: what would people have said if Microsoft had proposed a new OS revision that monitored everything you did and uploaded it to MS, permitted only MS to have administrative rights, and permitted only software approved by MS to execute?<p>I'm just amazed at how all you have to do is change the name of the company and change the form factor of the machine and people don't see it anymore.

5645750,comment,5643532,5644518,2,0,laumars,,,"<i>> Government sites are no different from any other kind of site </i><p>I beg to differ. I think government sites (as well as other reference material like programming manuals) are about getting visitors to their requested information as quickly and painlessly as possible. The user experience isn't from browsing the site, it's purely on whether the visitor found the piece of information or not. Where as recreational sites are about keeping visitors on the page for longer. ie encouraging them to browse around on related pages and re-visit the site again - preferably frequently. For that to work, having a prettier site is of more importance (note that I'm not saying <i>more</i> important than usability, just that aesthetics is of more importance on those types of sites than on reference sites).<p>It's like sports cars vs delivery trucks. The former needs to be prettier as it's a luxury item and few people would buy an ugly luxury item. So sometimes you'll see the design dictated a little by aesthetics (eg the way the doors open). The latter is bought to serve a specific purpose, so if it's not functional then people wouldn't buy it. This means that delivery trucks generally aren't as aesthetically pleasing but they don't need to be.<p>To expand on my example, when you described how form and function work beautifully together is a little like Eddie Stobart trucks, they've laid the function down first and then worked out how to make it feel a great deal more special by emphasising the functional attributes of the truck. And as much as I agree with you that examples like that in web design is fantastic, it's a very hard thing to judge. Sadly most people don't pull it off.",1367514040

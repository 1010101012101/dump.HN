804597,comment,803831,803831,0,0,gjm11,,,"This one may merit a summary, since there are a few subtleties. So, here goes.<p>Background: Ever since Goedel, we know that in any given system for doing mathematics some statements are <i>neither provable nor refutable</i>. So, if after much effort mathematicians fail to find either a proof or a disproof for some conjecture, it's natural to wonder whether perhaps that's because neither exists.<p>In some cases, an undecidability result of this kind would be pretty much equivalent to an actual decision. For instance: Goldbach's conjecture says ""every even number >= 4 is the sum of two prime numbers"". If this is undecidable then, in particular, I can't write down an explicit counterexample, so it might as well be true.<p>OK, so what about P=NP? Well, what David and Halevi have done is to show <i>something a bit like</i> the following: ""If 'P=NP' is not decidable using the axioms of Peano arithmetic, then any family of decision problems that's in NP is 'almost in P'"". But there are some fiddly details that might matter.<p>Detail #1: it's not actually ""is not decidable"", it's ""is <i>provably</i> not decidable"". The distinction between these two is important to anyone who's interested in this stuff in the first place.<p>Detail #2: it's not even ""is provably not decidable"", it's ""is provably not decidable, where the undecidability proof is of a particular kind"". They claim that ""any known technique for proving independence from sufficiently strong theories of statements that are neither self-referential nor inherently proof-theoretic"" is of this kind. Since the whole field of independence proofs got started when Goedel worked out how to make things ""self-referential"" that on the face of it look like <i>completely the wrong kind of thing to sustain self-reference</i>, I can't help but be a bit unimpressed by this.<p>Detail #3: What they mean by ""almost in P"" is this: there are arbitrarily long intervals of arbitrarily large numbers such that any problem whose size lies in one of these intervals can be solved in almost-polynomial time -- i.e., O(n^f(n)) where f grows very, very slowly, in particular more slowly than log log ... log n with any number of ""log""s.",1252061295

They noted how long it took the worms to learn, then they cut the worms up and fed the pieces to another batch of untrained worms. After their meal, the new worms were taught the same lesson. The second batch learned much faster. Wondering if this were a fluke (no, they were plenaria), some other scientists tried similar experimentation with mice. A batch of mice were trained to run a maze. Then their brains were removed, an extract was made from these brains and fed to another, untrained batch of mice. Once again, the new mice learned the maze much more quickly, up to twice as fast.""<p>""German researchers trained honey bees to expect food at a certain time every day. Then they cut off the bees' heads and transplanted a part of their brains into the brains of other bees. The bees with the brain transplants then expected the food at the same time of day.""<p>Does anyone know if this is for real?",1252059178

804574,comment,804443,804478,0,0,quant18,,,"Hedge funds, proprietary trading desks in i-banks, etc. have been using automated trading strategies for decades. But on the the agency equity trading side (the guys who move institutional investors in/out of larger long-term stock positions --- and the guys who are the driving force behind all the dark pools), it's still at least somewhat new.<p>Institutional clients were reluctant let a computer trade their big order. They wanted a human to be deciding how much to quote, when to trade a little fast/slow in response to market conditions, etc. And up to the early 2000s, agency ""trading strategies"" were still shockingly primitive. Marketing literature claimed they ""intelligently managed market impact risk vs. volatility risk"". Fancy way to describe a glorified time slicer. Human traders (not to mention prop algo strategies) earned easy money gaming these dumb things.<p>Eventually, the ""human advantage"" faded away because the humans in question were being expected to handle more and more volume (to earn more and more commissions) --- they just didn't have enough time to pay lots of attention to each client order and the prices being quoted all over the place on all the new alternative venues. And so the banks finally had an incentive to pour money into making their algorithmic trading systems less primitive.",1252059075

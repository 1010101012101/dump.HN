They pay well in part due to the skills involved and in part due to the fact that few people will take such jobs.  Currently, I am trying to figure out how to support myself while traveling.  I really want to leave where I am (both the job and the town). For me, I think the answer will eventually involve some kind of online/independent/entrepreneurial income.  But I'm not you, so what interests me may not at all interest you.<p>Peace and good luck.",1303653565

2478808,comment,2475854,2476388,4,0,hchasen,,,"That is the most fascinating myth I continue to hear about the market. As a non-seat owner, you see three prices: The price of the last trade OVER 15 minutes ago, where a buyer and a seller agreed to buy. The highest price someone offered to buy the stock 15 minutes ago, and the lowest price someone offered to sell the stock 15 minutes ago. When you actually buy or sell a stock, you often do not buy from or sell to a long term owner. Instead, the transaction happens with a ""market maker"" an entity that is a seat owner, knows the current offers right now as opposed to 15 minutes ago, and trades with you. There is almost NEVER a ""meeting of the minds"" on price between a buyer and a seller. In fact, there does not have to BE a buyer if a market maker decides the value of the stock makes it worth acquiring or selling at your offer price. (If you check ""Market"" for your offer price, I suggest you read almost anyone who writes about trading, but plug your ears because they start shouting ""no"" really loudly). So, to finish (sorry about the length of this), a huge or in some cases a simply mis-priced offer to buy or sell may unnerve the market makers. They may hesitate. The lack of quick sales at a given price to the market makers causes repricing by the sellers, which causes the price of the stock to fall. Try pricing a limit bid between the buy and sell price on your electronic brokerage. You'll see. Sometime it will sell right away, and sometimes it won't. If you want to sell right away, you'll drop the price. And, if you happen to find a stock in ""free fall"", you'll never sell, because the price you see is 15 minutes old.",1303651609

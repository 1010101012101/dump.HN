I thought that Hacker News might be the one safe zone where Jesus brainwashing is not regurgitated to the masses, but I guess not.  News flash for everyone, death is inevitable, and people do not rise from the grave, whether they harbor sympathy for humans or not.    Life&#x27;s meaning, if there is one, is at this stage incomprehensible to human beings.  If there is life beyond the grave, it definitely isn&#x27;t life, and it definitely isn&#x27;t what you think it is. How many more years must humanity be shackled to superstition and death fear before we fucking get over it and move on to the important work of getting off of this planet?

The undercover officers encouraged use of, and provided, dragon sleeves (a type of lockbox to make it harder to separate protestors who are in a sit-in or lockdown of some sort), which led to felony charges for seven of the protestors.<p>It was <i>entirely</i> a lucky break that one of the undercover officers was outed (a friend of a friend recognized him from school and knew he was a cop), and with that information the lawyer was able to request all the records that showed how things went down. Had that lucky break not happened, those kids would still be in jail today and saddled with felonies.<p>The prosecuting attorney tried to make the case that his Houston officers didn&#x27;t know about it, and that it wasn&#x27;t relevant to the case and that evidence shouldn&#x27;t be brought up. The judge, thankfully, disagreed.<p>In my experience, cops lie, prosecuting attorneys lie, and when they lie they face no consequences.<p>The officers overseeing this case, and the district attorney prosecuting this, should be out of a job or, better, in jail for trying to destroy a man&#x27;s life.  But, to them it&#x27;s just another day. They got caught this time, but dozens of others weren&#x27;t lucky enough to have surveillance footage proving their innocence.<p>I don&#x27;t have a very high opinion of police or the justice system, as you may have guessed by now.

Most of these colleges will do absolutely anything in their power to keep students from dropping out, so I&#x27;d say her chances of being readmitted were very, very high.<p>I know because I went to one of these schools.

7120285,comment,7111049,7114070,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"You&#x27;re absolutely correct that browser-based applications offer some very compelling advantages:  they&#x27;re run-everywhere (or at least, many wheres), they&#x27;re rapid-deploy, they&#x27;re particularly well-suited to data presentation and interaction tasks (which constitutes a large fraction of all apps), and rather importantly for small development shops, they offer a compelling path out of legacy support hell.  These are all true.<p>So are my critiques.  In particular, that the Web alternatives <i>aren&#x27;t</i> as fast or light as native apps.<p>Purely native apps <i>haven&#x27;t</i> &quot;lost the war&quot;.  They <i>are</i> the battleground for the most part on mobile devices, as you note, though you omit the observation that these typically operate via an API, which is in fact the direction I&#x27;m leaning as a hybrid browser/app model. Fully native apps retain crucial advantages in many spaces.<p>I&#x27;m curious as to what aspects of this you consider to be FUD?  I&#x27;m reporting actual memory utilization for apps doing comparable tasks, at least as far as rendering raw information is concerned.  If you want to consider graphical presentation, I&#x27;ve also got a number of PDF files open using xpdf and evince, both of which perform full graphical rendering including images.  The maximum RSS for these is 14 MB, and the 20 or so processes running here have far less system impact than my chromium child processes.<p>The train wreck I&#x27;m describing is precisely that.  Light websites are generally not an issue, but the full-fledged app instances, again, Google+, Gmail, and the like, cause wild amounts of swapping and instability, to the point that I make minimal use of them, and where possible find alternatives.  The RSS/Atom readers I mention aren&#x27;t doing the full work of a Web browser, but that&#x27;s precisely the point:  for keeping me informed of an information stream, they&#x27;re far more than sufficient, and require far fewer resources.  I can open an item in a console-mode browser (and yes, that&#x27;s old-school and an acquired taste), <i>or</i> pop over to a browser and read the item.  It&#x27;s far less overhead than keeping the stream in my browser at all times, and as I noted, the RSS readers offer hooks to perform other local actions if I choose.<p>I&#x27;ve written recently of the frustrations I&#x27;m increasingly having with browsers in general:  they serve neither the needs of application users nor of content readers particularly well.  Quoting myself:<p>&quot;It&#x27;s neither a good reading environment -- for that you&#x27;d want something like Readability, Pocket, Instapaper, or an eBook management tool such as Moon+Reader, Kindle, or (bad as it is) Calibre -- nor a decent applications environment: it&#x27;s bloated, crash-prone, slow, full of security holes, and underfeatured relative to native applications.<p>&quot;However in both cases the browser&#x27;s ability to load and display or run arbitrary content makes it convenient.&quot;<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7062219"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7062219</a><p>I see a few possible directions things could head:<p>⚫ Continue down the current path.  This is the course of least resistance.<p>⚫ I don&#x27;t know where the HTML working group(s) are headed, but continuing the pattern of HTML5 of offering highly semantic markup and leaning in the direction of an API model of HTML rather than a designer model (or in addition to) could be useful.<p>⚫ We now have <header> <article> <aside> and <video>.  How about a <stream> as I described, and perhaps native <plot> features which could present graphics based on realtime data updates?  Again, a huge class of applications now essentially consists of &quot;poll regularly for new data, update stream, present graphics, respond to user inputs&quot;.<p>⚫ A content-oriented browser which strips out virtually all distractions, and provide vastly improved content management and referencing capabilties (see:  zotero).  Readability, Instapaper, Pocket, etc. approach this.  I presently have a local &quot;unstyled.css&quot; stylesheet which I apply to many sites.  It works best on bare-naked pages (without any native styling or table/frame based page layout) but works pretty well on most minimally-styled pages.  And it is, for my purposes at least, almost always a <i>huge</i> improvement over native presentation.  In other cases I&#x27;ve extensively modified how pages present themselves.  See:  <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1tniu3/user_site_restyling_multicolumn_vs_fullwidth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1tniu3/user_sit...</a><p>⚫ An application-development platform based on (mostly) standard APIs and an HTML/SHTML transport back-end.

Conceal, don&#x27;t feel, don&#x27;t fear, conceal</i>.<p>College is certainly very different. Well, also, depending on the people you rely on in school.<p>I want to say that we should recognize depression and mental illness is just part of life and don&#x27;t be afraid when bad things come to us.<p>When I was in HS I had a severe depression. Starting in the junior year I had multiple anger issues and I had to drop some AP classes due to stress. In senior year I had several serious incidents within and outside of school. The stress was killing me. I couldn&#x27;t resist to see my grade going down, losing grasp of the new shiny robotics club I just started and couldn&#x27;t get the girl I really like at the time.<p>I was sent to hospital twice for evaluation. The second time, I was called by my counselor. She told me someone wanted to see me and I asked who. Two NYPD officers showed up and they escorted me to the hospital. I was really scared. I cried and I thought I was under arrested. I was only 17 at the time. I have never been arrested. I thought my counselor betrayed me. I thought everyone sold me out. My counselor said someone else from the school would come with me. A school aid came with us. Both evaluations are dull and tiring. My whole family had to stay with me until 2, 3AM in the morning. Some times later my mother said they all cried when they heard how sick I was. When the MD confirmed I was sick, it was like someone just sentenced me to death. I could finally tell people &quot;yes, I am sick&quot;, but at the same time I was sick and people would look at me slightly different.<p>We all have some experience with depression and anxiety. The experience is never pleasant. For me, it involves sleeping late and feel unmotivated. My day and night reversed. I could sleep for 12-14 hours a day. Nothing felt real when I was depressed. Just watch Frozen.<p>I could go on and on with a novel writing here (well I suck at writing..). But I can see I am a lucky person. I knew a lot of the people in HS. I used to work in the principal office, I was the go-to IT guy so I knew many people. When I was sick they would tell me &quot;go on John.&quot; The school didn&#x27;t ban me from entering the school. They hired psychiatrist to come to school on a weekly basis (apparently I wasn&#x27;t the only one having issue in my high school). The social worker and the psychiatrist were both Chinese so my parents could actually talk to them. My teachers didn&#x27;t penalize me much for the tardiness and would encourage me to come to school. PE became my favorite class. I could run 10-20 laps around the track and the sweat made me happier. Yes. Sun light is important. Locking a patient in a concrete building forever is not going to help much. Socializing with other patients won&#x27;t help much either... If my senior year last 10 months, I lost probably 7 months fighting depression with 3 months somewhat happy, crazy moments with classmates, friends and teachers.<p>College is different to me. People come and go. I go to a commute type of school. I get to come home. I get to sleep in and stay inside my room for a whole week if I want to. My parents can worry or feel angry but they are my parents. Unlike people who dorm they have to put up with other &quot;strangers&quot;. College is like going for a boring interview for a boring job. That&#x27;s just me. That&#x27;s just my experience.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t treat people with mental illness as third class citizen. We need to make rehabilitation more human. Drugs can damage brain and can change people. If you have watch <i>Fringe</i> you would know how much the drug and the environment affect Dr. Walter. And if you watch <i>Orange is the New Black</i>, prisoners are afraid of going to the psycho solitary.<p>I am proud to tell people my story because this is part of my life. I feel like a real person. I am not a Disney character. I have desire and my desire pushed me beyond my limit and so I become depressed, stressed and hopeless.<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid to tell people when you are not okay. It&#x27;s fine. Knowing you are not okay is the first step to rescue yourself. It&#x27;s okay to feel depress and get depress for a while. Just remember, one day, when you wake up, you will feel better and you will force yourself to go out there. When that happens, don&#x27;t let the freedom run away from you...<p><i>For the first time in forever, there will be music there will be light. For the first time in forever, I will be dancing through the night.</i><p>But of course, luck does play in a role. Some people are just not so lucky. They don&#x27;t get the nice people on their side and they die because of that...<p>As a side note, I was depressed recently again. I feel better now. I set my foot out of the house.

9950902,comment,9949859,9949859,0,0,VLM,,,"“This person is ready for promotion today.”<p>I would wager the percentage of employees working at a firm that still participates in promotion culture is low and dropping.  In other words &quot;ready for a promotion&quot; for most people in 2015 means they&#x27;re going to quit soon and get a higher level position at another firm.  I&#x27;m sure there still exist individual companies and maybe unusual and rare fields where promotion culture still exists, but it seems very rare and unusual.<p>Meanwhile in most areas outside SV/NYC computer programming during bubbles, there is a large excess of qualified workers vs positions.  For example in K12 education the state-U system graduates twice as many teachers as there are open positions for all new and past grads to apply for.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if they are in the top half that got hired because they are the best, or the most politically untouchable, or the most attractive, a year after hiring at review time they&#x27;re still going to be that top half.  So there&#x27;s nobody to give a hard time to in a review, because that lower half or lower 3/4 or whatever in any professional field are already working at Starbucks or as a waiter or bartender.  The world has &quot;needs improvement&quot; kindergarten teachers, but they don&#x27;t work at your neighborhood school, they never got a job in teaching and they serve you beer at the bar, for example.  The economy is in permanent contraction and the general population and higher-ed sector are in permanent expansion for many years now, outside bubble segments of the economy, so hiring one of the bad workers strongly reflects on a managers interview skills, making it even harder to admit anyone is below &quot;excellent&quot;.<p>Meanwhile increased labor mobility for the few that are employed means a review a couple years back, is a couple employers ago, so it is inaccessible and irrelevant, so its not like the wasted effort today will pay off in ten years.  Maybe a review in 1950 would come in handy at the same employer in 1960 to select a new director, but the firm has no loyalty to the employee and therefore the employee has no loyalty to the firm, for at least three human generations now, so its been culturally bred out of us.<p>So the folks at the top of a team will interpret an attaboy as &quot;start applying for higher level jobs elsewhere&quot; and economic realities mean you don&#x27;t have truly low performance employees to crack the whip upon, making the whole dog and pony show a waste of time for all involved.  This leads to an attitude of just pencil whip the process to get the meaningless metric of &quot;accomplished reviews&quot; up to 100% and be done with it.  Once the folks who&#x27;ve been pencil whipping it for their whole careers make it up high enough, its finally politically possible to discuss getting rid of the waste of time.  So here we finally are.",1437914987

They also maintain one of the only government sanctioned unions so they have greater economic democratic power as well. They are super-citizens and they have come to believe that the deference paid to them is in fact owed to them. They have convinced themselves that their lives are always in danger in every interaction so they are owed greater deference by society. Its my contention that the danger&#x27;s they face are not immediately present in every interaction and that they have actually been involved in creating the policies that put them in the situations where danger is greatest.<p>Its time that they stop taking for granted the powers and position that society bestows.

</code></pre>
Blacks make up 13.2% of the population, yet are arrested for 49.4% of the murders (3.7x their share), 32.5% of the forcible rapes (2.4x), 54.9% of the robberies (4.1x), 34.1% of the aggravated assaults (2.5x), 38.5% of the violent arson (2.9x) and 31.9% of other assaults (2.4x).  The numbers for whites (77.1% of the population) are 48.2% of the murders (.6x),<p>Now, it&#x27;s important to note that the explanation is almost certainly due to poverty and class; class in America being unfortunately highly correlated with race.  It&#x27;s also important to note there are almost certainly structural factors which protect some whites from being fairly arrested and lead to some blacks being unfairly arrested.<p>Given those violent crime statistics, is it not understandable that people in a potentially violent situation fear more for their lives when facing a random black, who is approximately 6.1 times more likely to commit murder than a random white?<p>And in fact, adjusted for the racial disparity in homicides, the police are 1.7 times <i>more</i> likely to kill whites than blacks; adjusted for the racial disparity in cop-killing, the police are 1.3 times more likely to kill whites than blacks[1].<p>&#x27;Black people&#x27; are not &#x27;stupid violent criminals,&#x27; and anyone who says so is a racist idiot.  But a higher percentage of black people are violent criminals, and thus it&#x27;s no wonder that a higher percentage (but fewer absolutely, and fewer adjusted for the higher rate of crime!) get killed for violent crime.<p>Now, how does one reduce the racial disparity (by reducing the rate of black criminality to that of white criminality, not vice versa, I hope)?  That&#x27;s really tough to answer.  Maybe it has something to do with ending the War on Some Drugs, which takes fathers away from their families; maybe it involves basic income, which would eliminate poverty; maybe it involves school choice and/or vouchers, to enable blacks to escape terrible schools and get good educations; maybe it involves using social persuasion to reduce the culture of violence (fat chance when that culture is so highly profitable!).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/21/police-kill-more-whites-than-blacks-but-minority-d/?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/21/police-kill-...</a>",1437914532

Minor extinction events are a permanent feature of evolution.<p>The first is the evolution of photosynthesis causing the Great Oxygenation Event[0]. In this, cyanobacteria converted CO2 into water and oxygen on a massive scale. This lead to a cooling of the planet due to reduced CO2 levels and the precipitation of iron oxides into massive deposits worldwide, today visible as &quot;banded iron formations&quot; [1].<p>The second mass extinction with a clear biological origin is the current one, where Homo sapiens is converting a massive quantity of carbon previously sequestered during the carboniferous back into CO2 and warming the planet as a result. In addition, this species destroys the habitats of many other species.<p>[0]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event</a><p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_iron_formation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_iron_formation</a>",1437914124

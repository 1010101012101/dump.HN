This company has never impressed me and they just don't seem to have the leadership to ever become viable.  They've already burned through lots of money, promising the whole time that profitability is right around the corner.<p>This model isn't going to be out until 2011, by then, GM and Toyota will likely have more commercially viable PHEV models available to the public.  I just don't see Tesla getting past a niche market.  ANd getting past that point should be the expectation given the size of this loan.",1234443518

Not everybody was hurt initially, but the effects are gradually spreading throughout the economy. It seems likely that this will result in a drop of IT spending.<p>Certain products may do well, though, if they look likely to save companies money. Maybe that's what happened to Joel.",1234443395

478367,comment,478284,478308,0,0,pmjordan,,,"FTP is actually a lot older than HTTP and therefore wasn't developed as an alternative. Traditional, multi-socket FTP actually has massive disadvantages in today's firewalled, NATed internet. HTTP is more useful than FTP or most other protocols for transferring individual files these days. I've never worked with WebDAV, but it seems like it would be a preferable alternative almost anywhere you might use FTP.<p>As an example where HTTP doesn't work so well, is pushing information as opposed to servicing requests. COMET is a hack and requires you to be very careful with clients. (e.g. the 2 connection limit in older browsers) You'd only really want to use it where there's no alternative, like in a browser.<p>Basically, HTTP is great for servicing individual requests. It can do kind of do persistent connections, but they're more an optimisation than part of the design and therefore optional for the client even if the server suggests them.<p>If your use case falls outside of the basic request/response premise, you can maybe use it for prototyping for a while, but you should probably switch to something more suitable to your setup after that unless you need to use HTTP for reasons outside of your control.",1234443219

478365,comment,478284,478308,0,0,moe,,,"Well, it seems the author drank a bit too much of the webservices kool-aid.\nHTTP is just one protocol amongst many. It was never meant to be ""universal"". The only reason why it's being abused for even the most unsuitable tasks nowadays is because when all you have is a hammer then everything starts to look like a thumb...<p>There are many purposes where HTTP is not suitable at all. Realtime audio/video comes to mind - UDP is commonly used here because even the TCP latency is too much. Anything where you need a persistent, bi-directional connection is not a good match either. Anything where you need to push from server to client. In short: Anything that doesn't fit into the request/response paradigm.<p>In fact, many consider HTTP in its current incarnation to not even be suitable for the interactivity that we expect of modern webapps.<p>But ofcourse that doesn't stop the truly enlightened.\nHence we got abominations like ""Comet"", a persistent stream-socket emulated on top of an inherently request/response-based protocol. Or RSS, which is nothing more than Usenet done really, really wrong - all lessons unlearned.<p>Sorry, got a bit carried away. But you get the idea I guess.",1234443145
478364,comment,476375,477832,0,0,swombat,,,"That's not quite true. Identifiers are one thing, but language clarity helps too. For instance, in PHP you might have written:<p><pre><code>  $recent_joiners = new Array();\n\n  foreach ($user in $project.all_users) {\n    if ($project.join_date($user) > ONE_MONTH_AGO) {\n      $recent_joiners.push($user);\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat's using fairly clear identifiers, but because of all the boilerplate code noise and the less clear language constructs, it looks less readable. Also, this requires a lot more specific meta-programming (like the ONE_MONTH_AGO constant), whereas the example I pasted uses vanilla Rails.",1234443106

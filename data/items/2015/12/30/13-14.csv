And since when is marking flaky tests is &quot;completely messed up practice&quot;?<p>Ok so a lot of this is about coding practices and such but... like the guy said, those problems <i>sort themselves out</i>. Bad security gets broken into, the companies eventually get hit and either die out or fix themselves. Etc...<p>There&#x27;s a lot of completely messed up practices in tech. Oh lord, <i>especially</i> as a european looking in to the SV world. Some of those messed up practices I can&#x27;t even mention on HN because people think they are so normal, I get mass downvoted and have to engage 5 people telling me how normal this is (in fact I might even have to engage in it by just mentioning this).<p>1. The issues highlighted tend to be problems specific to people. Programmers that don&#x27;t know how to do some aspect of security properly, that&#x27;s a problem specific to those guys. You put me next to them, I&#x27;ll do that bit properly but will be clueless about a different bit. It&#x27;s all fixable.<p>2. The actual programming & design is the least problematic, mostly because it&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s most easily changed. Trying to change culture gets you fired. Fixing a pipeline with noticeable improvements gets you promoted. The one bit I did agree with was that it is hard to <i>show</i> improvement when you prevent a fire. I also think that&#x27;s fixable and I also think that&#x27;s a people problem, except at the manager level.<p>You want messed up practices?

10812010,comment,10803136,10810915,0,0,marknutter,,,"> The point for me is recognizing that yes, I have been fortunate in my circumstances (solely by being born in a first world country in this century I was ahead of the majority of people born ever).<p>Even this concept bothers me. Why do we in the &quot;first world&quot; (God, even the term sounds pretentious) assume we are living the height of human existence? If you live in the US, you&#x27;re likely working longer hours than you would in almost any other country, and your fulfillment in life likely comes from acquiring, storing, and maintaining stuff. Contrast that with, say, rural Mongolians, who live off the land, have much tighter communities, and are largely oblivious to the problems we in high society have. Assuming that the rest of the world wants to live this insane existence we do is more offensive than not recognizing one&#x27;s privilege, IMO.<p>> If I could extend that same privilege to others I would in a heartbeat because I think it would be both morally right and for the greater good.<p>Again, one man&#x27;s privilege is another man&#x27;s hell. I would, for instance, <i>not</i> want to be a trust fund baby, living a life where nothing is a challenge, where I can never truly know if someone&#x27;s just being my friend or love interest because of my money, and where the rest of society stereotypes me because of a situation I had no choice about being born into. I&#x27;d rather be a rural Mongolian, TBH.<p>I also think it&#x27;s complete folly to assume that working in tech is the height of society. It&#x27;s <i>not</i>, which is why a lot of people don&#x27;t pursue it. It&#x27;s fucking tedious most of the time, you sit with your neck craned over a computer for 8+ hours a day and develop bizarre RSS conditions and nothing you build is actually material. It&#x27;s not like the trades where you move your body during the day and can actually step back and see what you built or helped build.<p>I am definitely <i>not</i> one of these people that things we should teach everyone how to code. Programming is lucrative right now because not many people have a passion or a tolerance for it but the need for it is increasing. It&#x27;s that simple. It&#x27;s not about privilege, or race, or sex, or anything. It&#x27;s just another tedious, painful thing that needs to be done that some people have a higher tolerance for than others (usually white, nerdy, socially-awkward people).",1451483492

Many of my methods do very little except test for preconditions, and the &quot;guard&quot; statement makes this very clear. For example, my action methods all look like this:<p><pre><code>    @IBAction func doSomething( sender: AnyObject ) {\n       guard ... else { NSBeep(); return }\n       guard ... else { NSBeep(); return }\n       guard ... else { NSBeep(); return }\n       \n       mutateState()\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s now a clear separation between the part that just checks preconditions, and the part that does something.

In nature we find systems that are orders of magnitude larger than any of the software we have succeeded in building so far. A biological ecosystem is composed of many organisms, each of which is made up of organs, then cells, then organelles and macromolecules - all towering atop the fundamental building blocks of molecules and atoms. All of these subsystems are dynamically bound together. At each level, elements will handle valid messages from their neighbours and safely reject messages that are, for whatever reason, not understood. In nature there is no compile time validation.

10811992,comment,10807228,10811148,0,0,VLM,,,"This is a classic integration / systems type problem.  I have a generic &quot;far north&quot; HVAC system (aka killer efficient condensing furnace, mere afterthought of an AC unit) and its connected to an Insteon compatible thermostat via industry standard wiring and protocols (basically residential thermo is 20 mA current loop for heat/fan/cool), and that&#x27;s connected to misterhouse via the usual insteon RF bridge and controller.  Integrating it all is hopeless, like late night infomercials for combination fishing pole/swiss army knife/spark plug wrench gadgets.  Its easier to debug industry standard components, also.<p>I messed around with it some years ago when it was new but haven&#x27;t permanently implemented anything.  I ran into the following problems:<p>1) UI.  When my MiL visits she&#x27;s at the Asimov-ian technological level where everything I do is at a high enough tech level to be magic, and correspondingly she&#x27;s scared/intimidated and its all just a non-starter.  She still has a round honeywell with a mercury switch at her house and occasionally does the typical woman thing of adjusting it multiple times a day to either 85 or 60 degrees while complaining &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work&quot;.  To a lesser extent my wife does the same thing, seeing as they&#x27;re related I&#x27;m not surprised.  I&#x27;ve tested it and it works, its just that automatic control even at the simple round honeywell thermostat level is beyond her, pretty much.  This will make smart thermostats a hard sell.  Magic being interchangeable with Magic, this makes smart thermostats a hard sell to most of the population, why not just put a sticker on the existing thermostat like those stickers that increase cell phone battery life 50% or reduce RF exposure by 100%, or basically the entire audiophile industry in a nutshell, or astrology.  I mean a controls engineer KNOWS the bode stability plot analysis of that algorithm is superior, but to the general public its just expensive, much harder to use, astrology.  Astrology being cheaper to implement than actual control theory, I guarantee the IoT will be polluted by &quot;smart&quot; things that are actually dumber than &quot;dumb&quot; things, but none the less very well marketed and likely very successful sellers because they&#x27;ll be cheaper.<p>2) Improvement is missing.  I had some ideas that sucked, but were fun to try.  So cycle the ventilation fan on and off at some rate to save energy rather than run all the time.  Well that makes the place stuffy and if I wanted a stuffy moldy house I&#x27;d have installed a smaller cheaper fan, I&#x27;m not paying this kind of mortgage per month to choke or be chilly, etc.  I ran into similar problems with messing with temperature control, such that anything I did to alter temperatures MOSTLY just reduced comfort.  As far as saving money this was not cheap back then and probably not even now, and I should have spent a couple $$$ on yet more insulation, or even newer windows, or an ever more efficient furnace, etc.  The one protocol that was a winner WRT comfort was slightly warmer temps in the morning when getting up and gradual lowering by bedtime.  A lot of IoT projects are like this, very techno cool nerdy impressive display of hard work and solved engineering problems, but none the less completely utterly useless in practice.  Why, if I spend $300 and a lot of hours, I can turn my nice comfy house into a drafty/stuffy dump, but its cheaper just to spend $100K less on the house if you want to slum it.<p>Anyone talking about IoT should be required to watch the black and white (free) Buster Keaton movie from about a century ago titled &quot;electric house&quot;.  There&#x27;s nothing new under the sun and back when electrification was a &quot;thing&quot; there were plenty of crazy gadget ideas that could be made fun of (see the movie) but had no long term impact.  A century from now, 99%+ of IoT will look to the future like Keaton&#x27;s &quot;electric house&quot; looks to us.  There is another immense insight to &quot;electric house&quot; movie that arguably the biggest impact of electricity to daily life is the microwave oven, which obviously was not predictable.  If there is any high impact IoT device in the future, it won&#x27;t be the 24352th model of thermostat, it&#x27;ll be something unimaginable today, or at least unimaginable to almost everyone.  Aside from the multiple learning aspects, Buster Keaton is hilarious so its worth the time.",1451482888

10811976,comment,10802413,10811189,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"As a meta-item on this discussion, it appears that we have a disagreement of value systems.  Leaving aside the nuances of measuring positive and negative aspects, it&#x27;s quite possible for two people to look at the same set of positives and negatives and value them differently, or even to classify them differently, counting some of the stated positives as negatives and vice versa.  It seems fairly clear that that&#x27;s happening here, as I&#x27;m assigning positive value to several things you either don&#x27;t care about at all or assign negative value to, and you&#x27;re assigning positive value to several things I either don&#x27;t care about at all or assign negative value to.  I suspect we&#x27;ll have a hard time agreeing on any high-level conclusion if we don&#x27;t even value the same things.<p>>> It&#x27;s quite easy to show the ill effects thereof.<p>> I haven&#x27;t found a study that does so convincingly.<p>I&#x27;d recommend &quot;Sequential Innovation, Patents, and Imitation&quot; (<a href=""http://www.researchoninnovation.org/patent.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchoninnovation.org/patent.pdf</a>), among others.<p>There also exist sources of information other than studies.  Pointers to specific cases suffice to demonstrate that harm exists and to show the nature of that harm.<p>My original point was not that the sum total of either the positive or negative effects could easily be quantified, but rather that the negative effects can more directly be observed in any given case, while the positive effects cannot.  Evaluating the negative effects simply requires showing an example of an invention that would have been published or product that would have been (or <i>was</i>) created, but was blocked by a patent; plenty of direct evidence exists for that.  Evaluating the positive effects requires not only identifying an invention/product, but determining whether the invention/product would still have been published/created in the hypothetical scenario in which patents did not exist.  An invention/product that made money from patents does not count in favor of patents; it only counts if it would not have been published/created <i>at all</i> without patents.<p>> > I read the meta-study you linked to, and found it quite unmoving.<p>> Yes, that&#x27;s why I pointed to the meta-study. I find it fairly balanced on the whole, identifying benefits as well as costs. The point was not to convince you either way, just to highlight that the situation is pretty nuanced. For instance, while classical assumptions (like disclosure) may not hold, there are a number of alternative ways patents encourage innovation (e.g incentivizing R&D investment, signalling, facilitating VC funding and entry, etc.)<p>I meant the description &quot;unmoving&quot; differently than you took it.  I did not mean &quot;neutral/inconclusive&quot;, though in many ways it was that.  I mean that I saw absolutely nothing in it that gave me the slightest inclination to support a patent system (and plenty not to).  The meta-study covered three points: 1) efficacy at promoting innovation (one genuine purpose of the patent system), for which it failed to provide any direct evidence (things that would not have happened otherwise) and could only fall back on economic claims (rewarding things that were done; see (3)); 2) efficacy at promoting publication (another genuine purpose of the patent system), which it rather conclusively refuted; and 3) economic incentives and monetary evaluation of patents, which as a non-goal of the patent system (only a means), is irrelevant when evaluating whether a patent system should exist.<p>I care about code published, ideas created, ideas made practical as products, and other things that create value.  I don&#x27;t care at all about things that just move value around, and neither does the stated rationale for the patent system.  The economic arguments made or mentioned in the meta-study only really talk about moving money around, but don&#x27;t seem to provide evidence to support any claim that any value is <i>created</i> as a result.  This seems, to me, like a circular argument, presupposing without evidence that &quot;money flowing towards patent holders&quot; promotes innovation.<p>Patent lawsuits are a zero-sum game with zero value: anyone&#x27;s gain is someone else&#x27;s loss, and no value is <i>created</i> when such money changes hands.  When I see money just moving around based on patent lawsuits, no matter <i>who</i> the plaintiff or defendant are, small or large, practicing or not, individual or company, I just see wastefulness.  Not quite as bad as destroying something entirely, but nothing of value either.<p>Inventions and products themselves, by contrast, can actually advance the progress of science.<p>>> Both, and other cases as well...<p>> Can you point to some examples of a novel technology that would have been available in the market if not for patents? Note that from-scratch re-implementations are just &quot;new&quot;, not &quot;novel&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m quite aware of the distinction drawn by patent law there, though I don&#x27;t consider the patent system&#x27;s definition of &quot;novel&quot; the only measure of a technology&#x27;s inventiveness or usefulness.  More critically, though it&#x27;s possible to use the idea covered by a patent (or to be sued claiming such) while also making novel advancements beyond that idea; that includes both novel applications of an existing idea, as well as novel inventions threatened by general patents on entire classes of ideas.  Thus, a program that is itself novel can be suppressed by a patent that applies (or threatens to apply) to <i>part</i> of it.  See also the &quot;Sequential Innovation&quot; concept and paper I pointed to earlier in this comment.<p>In any case, some specific examples that qualify as &quot;novel&quot;:<p>- Public-key (asymmetric) crypto was patented from 1977-1997.  Multiple people during that period attempted to develop programs for novel applications of asymmetric crypto, but could not due to the patent.  PGP was developed towards the end of the patent&#x27;s life, in spite of the patent, and the patent holder subsequently forced PGP to limit it to &quot;non-commercial use&quot; (and AFAICT the general belief is that they&#x27;d have killed it entirely if not for potential bad publicity).  In the absence of patents, encrypted email would have been available in the market far earlier.  (Note that the patent wasn&#x27;t for encrypted email; it was for asymmetric crypto in general; PGP was novel, as was asymmetric crypto before it.)<p>- WebRTC (and, in general, the availability of video in web standards) was blocked for <i>years</i> over what codecs to use, due both to patents on h.264 and threats of patents against VP8.  Video on the web would have been available years earlier if not for those patents.<p>- Some of the software implementing MP3 (and undistributable in the US or anywhere that enforced the patents on MP3) included multiple novel algorithms to produce better MP3 files (e.g. in bitrate allocation, models, performance), and produced significantly better and smaller MP3 files (and did so faster) than the &quot;official&quot; implementation.<p>- HyperProf, a piece of Java profiling visualization software (back in the JDK 1 days), was blocked due to a patent by Xerox on displaying trees (unrelated to profiling).<p>- GCC would have had runtime memory bounds checking (to prevent array overruns, etc) in 1996, years before the availability of programs like valgrind and similar, if not for a patent by a company named Pure Software.  The GCC implementation included several novel additions beyond the patent, and the patent was not known until after the work was done (and subsequently shelved).<p>> Since this is a Microsoft thread, appropriate examples would be Stax electronics and i4i. See also the Chien paper above which may have more numbers.<p>Both of which I&#x27;d hold up as examples for &quot;why we shouldn&#x27;t have software patents&quot;.  In particular, if you see i4i as a <i>good</i> example, then I&#x27;d deeply question your evaluation of value.<p>>> I don&#x27;t believe technological progress will grind to a halt, or even slow down, with patents (or even just software patents) abolished. I won&#x27;t necessarily argue with as much confidence that it will massively accelerate, either, though it certainly will in areas I care about.<p>> Depends on what you count as &quot;technological progress&quot;. I don&#x27;t necessarily count re-implementations of existing technologies as progress.<p>See the above cited paper on &quot;sequential innovation&quot;, and several of the above examples of novelty above and beyond a threatening patent.<p>(Apart from that: even a reimplementation of an algorithm without algorithmic improvements or other associated novelties may solve practical problems or otherwise improve on execution.  But even if you don&#x27;t consider that progress, see &quot;sequential innovation&quot; and the above examples.)<p>> I guess if you think, say, the Wright brothers didn&#x27;t really make modern flight possible or that Apple didn&#x27;t really revolutionize the smartphone industry, not much I can say.<p>That strawman sure was flimsy.  First, I neither said nor implied either of those things.  I&#x27;d quibble over the term &quot;revolutionize&quot; in the latter case, but hyperbole aside, Apple certainly made notable advancements.  But in both cases, so what?  Neither of those contradicts my statement that &quot;I&#x27;ve never once seen a patent lawsuit in which I could muster the slightest sympathy for the plaintiff or the slightest belief that they deserve anything&quot;.  If I see Apple suing someone over smartphone technology, or for that matter someone suing Apple over smartphone technology, in neither case would I think the plaintiff deserved anything.<p>You seem to presuppose a pile of additional reasoning that does not follow.",1451482484

Most good JITs use profiling information, which is collected at runtime -- this has some memory overhead, but results in better code.<p>> And profiling is limited in what it can do, especially when AOT compilation with PGO as used by projects like Firefox is considered.<p>Modern JITs are like _very_ sophisticated PGO AOTs, but they have true profiles exposed to them. Besides, the overhead for even a good JIT is not that large, it&#x27;s just that on mobile devices even a bit more RAM is more than you&#x27;re willing to afford.",1451481617

You take the last vertex and make it a matrix, adding 1 at the end like you will do with the others, i.e. (10 10 10 1).  Then you multiply it by the X rotation matrix ( <a href=""https://open.gl/transformations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://open.gl/transformations</a> ) using the appropriate angle.  You now have the new correct position of that point.  Now do the same for the other vertexes on the cube.  The cube is still the same size and shape but its position has shifted.<p>You can do other easy transformations with matrix math.  You can scale the cube with a scaling matrix - doubling it, halving it, or whatnot.  Just multiply each vertex to the same scaling matrix.  The new coordinates have the same size.<p>You can have a translation matrix to, where each vertex is multiplied by the same translation matrix, so that the cube is translated x, y, z coordinates from its origin.<p>You can also chain these matrix multiplications, so that the cube size is doubled, then rotated 60 degrees on the Y axis, then moved 20 X, -30 Y, 15 Z via translation.

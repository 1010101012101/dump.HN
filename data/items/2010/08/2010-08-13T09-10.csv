I believe that there are many paths to success - working in a big company and rising up in the ranks would be as satisfing to me as any other thing I wanted. It's just about how you define success, and if the thing you do is going to give you success.<p>If you define your success by something that you have been unsuccessful at for years, it seems to me you will get depressed sooner or later.",1281690773

1600456,comment,1600240,1600396,0,0,Lewisham,,,"For all the crap Java the language gets, it's led to many mature, excellent projects and libraries (just take a look down the Apache list), it's led to the JVM and Scala, Clojure, etc.<p>The language itself has shown that it probably isn't going to get past version 7, and even getting that through was by cutting a whole lot of features (lol closures lol?). However, that would just mean Java faded into insignificance when a new leader emerged. I think this may well have fallen to Scala given time. Oracle is unnecessarily hastening Java's demise, and from my limited understanding of the reporting, might be taking the JVM with it. That's a really bad thing for software development in general.",1281690709

1600449,comment,1600240,1600410,0,0,dagw,,,"The answer to 1 is probably ""very, but not impossible"".  They'd basically have to rewrite everything above kernel (which is Linux) from scratch.  More importantly it would be a PR nightmare.  Who wants to base their product on a platform where the platform owners are happy to throw away all your hard work and make you start from scratch every once in a while.<p>As to 2 and 3, this probably won't affect anybody else.  Symbian (and everybody else) use an officially licensed JVM from Sun(now Oracle)  and as such should be safe.  The reason Google is in trouble is that the wrote their own VM rather than licensing the VM from Oracle.<p>As to 4. Well that's anyone's guess.",1281690554

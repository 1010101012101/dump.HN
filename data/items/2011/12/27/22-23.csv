3397810,story,,,29,19,badger_com,"Badger.com is a new Domain Registrar. We oppose SOPA and like elephants.",,"Hey HackerNews, six months ago we started building a brand new registrar because we were underwhelmed by all of the existing options.  Here's what makes us different:<p>- We won't try to upsell you with unnecessary add-ons.<p>- We want registering and managing domains to be an enjoyable experience... not something you're forced to tolerate.<p>- We've spent a lot of time making our interface fast, simple and easy to use.  We've built our frontend website entirely in JavaScript to make the experience as fast as possible.<p>- Our website is open source and is built on top of our API. The source code (JavaScript, CSS, etc) for our website can be found at https://github.com/badger/frontend and the documentation for our API can be found at http://badger.github.com/.  If you'd like to make improvements, we welcome and encourage GitHub pull requests!<p>- Whois privacy is free and enabled by default.<p>- DNS hosting is free and enabled by default.<p>- For a limited time, we are offering domains for $8 (new registrations, transfers and renewals).  Please be aware that our normal price is $15 per domain.  If you are registering or transferring lots of domains, volume discounts will apply which can bring the price all the way down to $10 per domain.<p>- We are an ICANN accredited registrar, not a reseller.  We only support .com and .net at the moment but we will be adding support for many more TLDs in the next couple of weeks so please bear with us.<p>- We're a startup in San Francisco.  Although our team is small right now, we have really big ambitions and what we have so far is just the beginning.  <i></i>We thrive on feedback, so don't hold back!<i></i>  You can send questions and suggestions to us at support@badger.com and we will respond as soon as we can.<p>First 100 people to signup get a free domain:<p>https://www.badger.com/#register/hackernews",1325026725

It's the political system that needs to be fixed. Those lobbyists <i>should not be out in the lobby</i>. The fact that they have more clout because they are right there is the major problem. Saying we need to get boots on the ground so we can compete with lobbyists is to miss the core problem that we shouldn't need to compete with lobbyists. We should be able to email, call or walk into an office and have our voice heard. Our vote should matter more than money.<p>In the meantime, yes, we need to be active enough to change the political system, but changing activism should only lead to the larger goal of changing the fact that activism shouldn't need to be changed.",1325026683

See: ebay.com.<p>About arbitrage: I agree with you, to some extent. By definition, as more people notice the price differences and take advantage of them, the arbitrage will become less and less profitable. If you intend to build a business that will scale and prosper in the long term, you need to provide value to people and not tie yourself to short-lived arbitrage opportunities. I work in finance and that fact is plainly obvious to a lot of us.<p>However, there is value added when you give people information. Information isn't free. Someone has to go out there and find all the prices, organize them, and show them to people. The arbitrage differential will grow smaller and smaller as competition grows, but at no point will this information be free. Given the possibility to find cheaper prices, people will pay if it's worth their while. If it's not money, at least page views.",1325026406

On one hand, it would definitely hurt certain plaintiff's lawyers who depend on these blockbuster class actions. On the other hand, it would be good for plaintiff's lawyers generally, because there would be a lot more suits without the consolidation process of a class action. And it would be good for defense lawyers, since there would be more suits to defend against.<p>As for the impact on consumers, the vast majority would just choose not to litigate for the small sums involved.

I once bought a new sealed copy of a collector's game, Panzer Dragoon Saga (eBay price ~$500+ back then) for $20 from a seller who was liquidating an old stash of games and listed the item as ""Panzer Dragoon Saturn"" and couldn't get any hits.<p>The problem of illiquidity has some fun implications assuming you're willing to take some product risk.  Back when I was in grad school in the Bay Area, I was flipping Fujiiryoki massage chairs (MSRP 5k, buying around 1-1.5k, flipping around 2.5-3k) and there are plenty more items out there.  This requires either good product knowledge (tons of old Chinese people who I knew wanted these) or a data-driven way of identifying high-price-point items without much/any historical pricing data.  This is a rather solvable problem that hasn't been tackled (that I know of) and can be a value point for your site I'd think.<p>As for buying liquid items low, subscribing to CL RSS feeds with the right search terms <i>can</i> do the trick, though I neither confirm nor deny that I may have once written a CL page refresher to buy Burning Man tickets at cost (instead of from scalpers who were charging hundreds more).  Back when I didn't really value my time, offering to pick up at a time of their location/convenience and pay cash.<p>Misc selling tips as an enthusiast: and legit work/school email or Googlestalk-able email establishes you as a ""real"" person.  A phone number is almost a must-provide these days too.  Pay low(er) and always in cash (or cert. check at bank) but assure the buyer that you'll be there and make the transaction convenient and easy.<p>It's an addictive hobby, I know... :/",1325025720

Both individually and collectively, these Christian anarchists offer a compelling critique of the state, the church and the economy based on numerous passages from the New Testament. Yet despite the relevance and growth of this literature, no generic study bringing together these different thinkers or reflecting on their contribution has been published to date, because such work involves meticulous searching, compiling and structuring of countless different texts and sources, not all of which are easily accessed.

Space is big and hard to hide things in, but it is full of all kinds of smallish debris in the vicinity of a solar system. If you have something of about the right size, orbit, albedo, radar reflectivity and temperature, it ought to be hard to distinguish it from a stray bit of rock or ice too small for anyone to have paid attention to it in the past.<p>Bearing this in mind, suppose that you built a small, camouflaged satellite which would just sit there at ambient temperature until it received instructions, upon which it would point itself at a given patch of sky, do the finest bits of the aiming using its own passive sensors and then fire a nuclear bomb-pumped x-ray laser at whatever has the misfortune to be there. With something like this, one could probably swat any reasonable craft out of the sky before it had time to respond. You could perhaps also use such things offensively by putting them on orbits that will take them within their effective range of whatever you want them to shoot, though they would stand out a bit more that way.<p>The only real countermeasure to these I can think of would be to move your spacecraft rapidly back and forth at all times, which is probably infeasible given the amount of reaction mass it would take.<p>I'm not sure what the implications of all of this are, but I suspect they would be interesting.",1325024918

It just wasn't due at close - instead it was baked into your mortgage payment every month in the form of a slightly higher interest rate. At the end of the day, brokers and bank branches want to earn a few thousand for ""originating a mortgage."" This is fancy way of saying retailing a mortgage. Although they often take less - maybe $900 - for a refinance. You can find out how much you were charged by looking through your mortgage paperwork. The bulk of the mortgage broker or bank branch retail mark up comes from something that is usually labeled ""origination fee.""<p>That said, thanks to recent reforms, an individual brokerage can no longer charge two borrowers will different commissions for the same mortgage. However, two different brokers can each charge very different fees. Quicken Loans, one of the largest mortgage originators out there, is notorious for charging much higher commissions than nearly anyone else. And thanks to the difficulty of comparison shopping, they're still successful in obtaining premium prices... even in the age of Zillow and Google.",1325023537

3397618,comment,3397293,3397551,22,0,zecho,,,"Exactly. It's a hobby, but while scaling it up is hard to do, it is not impossible. Two stories.<p>I wrote a program awhile back that would look for iPod Touches on my local Craigslist and would analyze the price for many different versions. If an individual iPod was available and was below mean price within a given time frame, I'd send the seller a note almost immediately. Then, if I purchased the item, I'd relist it at the mean price. Completely an arb play.<p>What I learned was that 1) iPods are easy to sell, 2) People who buy on craigslist are flaky and tend not to show up, 3) The time spent waiting around to meet people was obnoxious, and 4) Sometimes sellers see what you did with their item and send you angry emails.<p>I never made more than a few hundred bucks, but it was an interesting experiment nonetheless.<p>Second story: For years, my wife sold used books. She'd go to estate auctions and buy boxes and boxes of books. She'd go to library sales and buy hundreds of books. Then she'd sell them on the Amazon marketplace. She would walk into these places with a barcode scanner and would check their price and sales rankings on Amazon. If it was in a decent margin for her, she'd buy the item. This actually did scale, but she quit when it became less of a hobby side income and more like real work. She's a nurse by trade, and the book selling was never meant to be anything more than a hobby.<p>So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that arbitrage of used goods can be a business, but it depends heavily on the availability of the supply of used goods. Books worked for my wife because she could buy dozens of them at a time and ship dozens of them them all from the post office down the street as orders came in. For me, I was running around town picking up items and dropping them off.",1325023319

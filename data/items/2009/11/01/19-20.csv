However, subscribing to RSS feeds for each site would be too tedious.<p>A browser plugin (or rather built-in feature) that popups a warning in an overlay bar at the top of the window (like the password remember feature in Firefox), would be better. It could receive data from a centralized service, privacy policy RSS feeds, or just by screen-scraping the policy at a specified interval and checking for changes.",1257102989

I can tell you that, here in NYC these services do get a fair bit of use (seamless.com, in particular, though I think GrubHub may also be popular).  I attribute this to the combination of a large number of affluent people working long hours and the relative difficulty of getting around that big city life presents.<p>I think the reason why factors like this are important is that, all things being equal, people would rather dine in a restaurant if they're going to pay ""eating out"" prices. When you go to a restaurant, of course, you are paying for more than the food. You are also paying for (hopefully) a nice atmosphere and a feeling of relaxation and wealth. It's also nice to get out of the house/office.<p>Oddly enough, I draw an analogy to RSS readers. (Which has been on my mind recently for obvious reasons.) The thing that people overlook about RSS is that the value of a website is in more than just paragraphs of text. Websites are also designed to create a certain kind of experience. The premise that underlies this design work, of course, is that design adds value for the user beyond just the words on the page. But that added value is stripped away when content is consumed through an RSS feed. The question then becomes whether the added convenience (etc.) of aggregation into a feed outweighs the value lost.<p>Similarly, the question for GrubHub users is whether the loss of the secondary benefits of eating in a restaurant (and add to that, of course, the small additional monetary expense) are made up for by the added convenience.

If any of those are true, you will tip the balance away from a completely successful business model.<p><i>Every</i> business model has inefficiencies in the supply chain. Much of it falls under what's called ""shrinkage"". Sometimes it's from theft, other times it's from spoilage, weather, etc.  The truth is, just like in heating, cooling, power production, engine design or anything else, you can <i>never</i> achieve 100% efficiency and in the case of consumer-facing products and services, I suggest you re-evaluate such pursuits before they ruin what otherwise would have been a profitable business model because you've alienated your customers.",1363973218

Apparently you think it's self evident, so doesn't require explanation</i><p>To turn the question on its head, why <i>should</i> anyone choose Perl over the alternatives? I honestly have never seen a reason to switch. Not terribly many others have either, as of late. I will attempt to lay out some of my reasoning.<p>When evaluating a new language & ecosystem, I tend to look for an active and welcoming community, a large selection of actively maintained libraries, and lastly a language that is interesting and/or fun to develop in. I can't really pontificate with authority on how Perl fares with regards to the above 3, but I will share my perception. Feel free to contradict (of course).<p>1. Community : there's no doubt Perl's community has taken a bit of a hit over the last n years population wise. In addition, the Perl community has, anecdotally, a reputation for being a bit terse [1]. Nothing cut and dry here, but again nothing that stands out IMHO.<p>2. Libraries : by extension of a diminishing pool of active contributors, it stands to reason some modules may not be as actively supported as their counterparts in other languages. This is compounded by the uncertain state of the language's version (5,6,7?)<p>3. Language : I personally have enjoyed coding in Perl, and am not really too intimidated by its historical warts. It's quite possible to write readable Perl, so write-only accusations are of little concern (to me).<p>Notes :<p>* Versioning : As an outsider, the current state of Perl's versioning is confusing. Perl 6 has been in development for over a decade, and I've seen mention of Perl 5.2 being released as Perl 7. None of this reflects positively on the language as a whole as it raises concerns about future proofing and maintainability.<p>* Mojolicious : Looks nice. My only concern would be that, based on the GitHub commit history, it is overwhelmingly governed and contributed to by a single individual. More so than even Rails, and significantly more so than Django. This isn't necessarily a negative, but I'd certainly want to trust him before building a production app using his tool.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.perl.org/users/joel_berger/2012/10/why-people-dont-like-mojolicious.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.perl.org/users/joel_berger/2012/10/why-people-d...</a>",1363971803

Don't confuse this with a service that perhaps experiences ongoing issues. Those are material points that a buyer should know and are fair game to raise in marketing.",1363971791

Sexist jokes directed towards men can also be sexist and contribute towards a hostile workplace. Nor do the jokes need to be directed towards the person or even the gender of the person making the complaint. That's well established by the courts.<p>Quoting from the EEOC:<p>> Sexual harassment can occur in a variety of circumstances, including but not limited to the following:<p>* The victim as well as the harasser may be a woman or a man. The victim does not have to be of the opposite sex.<p>* The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, an agent of the employer, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or a non-employee.<p>* The victim does not have to be the person harassed but could be anyone affected by the offensive conduct.<p>* Unlawful sexual harassment may occur without economic injury to or discharge of the victim.<p>* The harasser's conduct must be unwelcome.<p>You may say that going after this situation is ""extremely detrimental"" to the overall cause, but you've switched different topic. escaped_hn asked where the abuse claim came from, not if the abuse claim was justifiable.<p>Let's see how this an organization's Harassment policy might handle this. I quote now from <a href=""http://www.maine.gov/ag/about/harrassment_policy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maine.gov/ag/about/harrassment_policy.html</a> :<p>> Further examples of sexual harassment include: behavior that is verbal and sexual in nature - such as comments about a person's looks, personal inquiries, sexual jokes, use of derogatory sexual stereotypes, uttering sexually suggestive sounds, writing sexual notes, use of State computer equipment to send, receive and/or download material of a sexual nature; non-verbal sexual behavior- such as looking someone up and down, staring or leering at someone's body, deliberate blocking of a person's path, displaying sexual visuals, making sexual gestures; or physical - such as pinching, grabbing, sexual assault or any physical contact of a sexual nature.<p>> As a matter of State policy, any behavior of a sexual nature in the workplace is considered unprofessional regardless of whether it constitutes illegal sexual harassment. ... As part of their supervisory responsibilities, supervisors are required to actively prevent or stop inappropriate, unprofessional conduct in the workplace regardless of whether the conduct rises to the level of illegal harassment. If they become aware of any such conduct occurring through personal observation or information from another party, they must consult with the Office's EEO Coordinator and take immediate and appropriate corrective action, including discipline, to end the conduct. Corrective action is required regardless of whether a complaint is made or the conduct appears to be unwelcome. Even if the person providing information requests that no action be taken, the supervisor must contact the EEO Coordinator. Managers and supervisors who fail to fulfill their obligations under this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.<p>This unambiguously says that a supervisor at the Maine AG's office must report any joke of a sexual nature, even if there's no complaint, no indication of if it's unwelcome, no indication that it's discriminatory, no thought that it's sexist, and even if there's a request that no action be taken.<p>So even if you don't think this is a sexist joke, the undeniable fact that it is a joke of a sexual nature means that it is and unprofessional and reportable behavior for some workplaces.",1363971739

As you can see in this screenshot, <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/D8rMRBa.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/D8rMRBa.png</a> , my firefox's UI takes up less space and is only two rows. Chrome has three rows (the close/max/min buttons, tabs, and navigation). There is no way on windows to reduce that top height. Firefox is flexible enough that you can trivially do what I have with only some simple css. The defaults for firefox are roughly as minimalistic as chrome too. Also, on my linux box my firefox is thinned down even more, while chrome just looks horribly out of place since you can't alter its appearance to closer match the native environment.<p>I prefer firefox for quite a few reasons, but since you bring up the UI, that's the only one I'll mention here.",1363971716

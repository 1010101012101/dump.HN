This is great and I'm sure they could still come up with excellent products like a new macbook pro with improved battery life. Jobs is responsible for the vision (direction of the company), if it weren't for him nobody would have dared to invest such vast amounts of resources and time into building something like an iPad.<p>It's in my opinion that Cook can do excellent work in the short-term making the company grow on paper by optimizing the supply side, but in the long-term he lacks the vision to conquer new fronts.",1295873604

Just make your case, big guy.<p>Having said that, I agree, with one catch. Here's the thing: <i>we currently don't have 3-D movies</i>.<p>We have this fake 2-plane deal put on with funky glasses. That's why the cineamtographers can screw around with your eyes so much like the letter writer explains.<p>I want 3-D. True 3-D. Not some hacked up fake 3-D. True 3-D would consist of a large, rotating drum in the middle of my living room, approximately 6 or 7 feet tall, and several feet wide. Images would display as three-dimensional objects, viewable from all angles.<p>Big? Cumbersome? Impractical? Probably. But at least it's a true 3-D experience. When a couple of actors appeared and started talking, it would literally appear as if they were in the same room as you. Directors couldn't have arrows poke out at your eyes or any of that other silly nonsense that they seem to not be able to refrain from doing with the current tech.<p>The current hacky stuff that passes for 3-D is broken and won't be fixed, this much is true. It remains to be seen whether or not this tech finds a niche in games or specialty cinema, though. It's also an open question as to the future of <i>real</i> 3-D.

I understood the argument to be twofold. Firstly, even if you don't get headaches, your brain is still working overtime, which makes your movie-watching experience less pleasurable than it would be if you were watching a true holographic movie. Secondly, because of the way the brain processes images and the illusion created by 3D movies, the technique limits the genre because one cannot use edits that are very rapid or have shots with a lot of horizontal movement.<p>Whether that amounts to ""not working"" is perhaps up for discussion, but I think they have a point that the problems with 3D extend far beyond the fact that some people have adverse physiological reactions while watching.",1295873044

But when someone says something is impossible and is right, we'll never really know for sure; the most we can say is that no one has done it yet. So: time travel? teleportation? faster than light travel? Plenty of eminent (and in some cases elderly) scientists have said, and doubtless will continue to say, that these things are impossible; for all we know they really are; but even if they are we'll never know for sure that Clarke's First Law is wrong for them.)<p>[EDITED in response to two comments: If the claim is ""3D done just like it is now will never work"" then I agree that CFL isn't very relevant. If it's ""3D movies will never work"", which is what I think ""3D doesn't work and never will"" ought to mean, then I think CFL applies. So maybe I'm really only criticizing Ebert and not Murch, who does embed into his comments the sentence 'Nothing will fix it short of producing true ""holographic"" images.'. I do wonder whether the quotes around ""holographic"" are trying to define it to mean ""anything that fixes this problem"" rather than strictly ""something close to full-wavefront reconstruction using coherent light"", in which case I guess he's right <i>by definition</i> and therefore vacuously. I would certainly not want to bet that actual literal holograms are the only way to solve the problem.]",1295871856

2134934,comment,2128953,2129937,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Maybe we're making some progress:<p>So, we started with social graphs, social media, and social search (below I refer to these three as 'social X') and asked the questions about purposes, the utility of social X, and the means to the purposes.<p>For entertainment, there is a huge industry from movies and TV.  One lesson is, high quality content with broad appeal is expensive to produce.  In particular I don't see Internet social X doing much better at generating good entertainment content.<p>I will insert another point:  The more such good entertainment is produced, the more expensive it is to produce even better entertainment.  So, we should be moving to about enough high quality digital recordings of such entertainment to satisfy anyone for life and, thus, have less pressing reasons to produce more.<p>You mentioned:<p>""This data is usually used as you stated to find similarities . In people, for matchmaking sites, here are things purchased by people who...read the same stuff, watch the same movies, etc.  It can turn out well, but for what was known by the Netflix challenge teams as the Napoleon Dynamite problem.  A movie that based on similarity clusters was almost impossible to predict how a user would rate it.""<p>I can believe that!  Apparently the idea was that persons A and B are 'similar' and person A likes movie X so that then maybe person B will also like movie X. That is not promising because the 'connections' are too crude:  E.g., two sisters can be very close yet be very different in the movies, music, clothes, boys, etc. they like.<p>It appears that the Netflix people fell into a trap:  Apparently commonly in the literature of 'collaborative filtering', 'recommendation engines', and 'data mining' has been the suggestion that we should start by putting people into 'clusters' and for each cluster observe what movies, music, etc. were popular in that cluster.  Then, given another person, say, a user, find what cluster they were in and then recommend to them what was popular in that cluster.  Not a good idea.  Interesting to hear that the idea failed!<p>So, we might conclude that some of the data for such clustering, recommending, etc. can be represented as social graphs, but that step appears to be just a tangential afterthought and not a good example of the utility of social graphs.<p>Yes, people like to communicate and form communities:  Significant examples from the past include back fences, kitchen tables for coffee, lunches, dates, parties, various meetings (e.g., PTA, alumni, school board, political parties, church), school, and work.  Such conversations and communities have been significant for romance, building a business, getting a job, education, skills, arts, crafts, politics, and more.  But I'm failing to see that the communities that result from Internet social X are very significant.<p>Net, I don't see current Internet social X doing very well on entertainment, conversations, or communities.<p>I see the Internet as terrific for a lot, e.g., news, short video clips, technical information, the content on Wikipedia, general information on organizations, information from topical blogs and long tail Web sites, shopping, and more.  But so far I don't see social media as leading to very significant utility.<p>Then in particular I don't see much value in the data on social graphs.<p>Still, Facebook has 500+ million users and is worth maybe over $50 billion; Twitter, Foursquare, etc. are significant; and Page believes that 99% of social search has yet to be done.<p>So, here we can look at the weakness in social X, and that might mean that there is an opportunity to do better and have some astounding success.  Or, a guess is that current social media efforts are not really addressing the fundamental purposes and opportunities very directly or well so that a better effort could be quite successful.",1295870444

For those of you who don't know what Y is because you did not read the two sentence explanation of it that I did when Malcom Gladwell covered the topic better, it is Insert Wikipedia Definition.  This means Non-Sequitur, Semi-Sequitur, and Tangentially Related Thought.  X is awesome, please hire me.""<p>Edited to add:<p>On reflection, that might sound excessively snarky.  OK, backing it up: Nash equilibria do not speak to system-wide improvements, at all.  The point of the game is that players get their own payoffs rather than getting any value from the sum-of-all-players payoff.  The insight from Nash equilibria is that they can't move to a <i>higher payoff for themselves</i> because it requires simultaneous cooperation, which is difficult for some games.<p>Nash equilibira do not attempt to answer the question ""Why do organizations not want to cease to exist?""  That isn't a very hard question in game theory -- most players are generally assumed to not desire annihilation.  The problem isn't that you're stuck at a Nash equilibrium -- the problem is that an organization <i>does not desire annihilation</i>.  Its like doing a game theory analysis of my salary negotiation with my employers and saying ""Hmm, Patrick doesn't appear to be taking the negotiation tactic 'Shoot self in head'"".  That doesn't imply that my employers and I are at a Nash equilibrium, in fact, there could be multiple mutually rewarding paths from our current strategies.  Its just that none of them involve me shooting myself in the head.",1259138952

Think about machines with many different apps running on them, and pumping out new feautures or more major bug fixes is more important than some minor issue like a memory leak (in who knows which of your apps) that is fixed - and prevents the box from getting in a bad state - with a reboot of the machine.

Most versions tell it that he noticed that 1 + 100 = 2 + 99 = 3 + 98 and so on, yielding a general formula of n * (n + 1) / 2, so you could probably skip Wolfram for this one.

960847,comment,960163,960783,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>The science has been done.</i><p>I'm afraid I don't see any citations in that article for studies done specifically on polyphasic sleep. I see citations for the natural length of the human day (24.2 hours), sleep deprivation effects, maximum waking time for humans, etc. But nothing but unbacked, though strongly held, assertions about polyphasic sleep. I may have missed it, but every time the article goes into discussion of polyphasic, it seems to talk <i>around</i> the issue when providing citations, and explicitly to the issue when it is clearly the authors opinion.  It has the feel of a religious tract, rather than a scientifically sound article.<p>I'm not saying the author is wrong.  I've never had much luck with polyphasic sleep, as I mentioned above, and I'm certainly not going to argue that it's a great idea without having had any success with it myself or at least having seen good science on the matter.  But, if this is the best ""science"" there is to offer suggesting it does not work, then I don't think I'm convinced.<p>That said, I'm leaning towards one of the ""core sleep plus naps"" variants this time around rather than the 6x20 minute routine.  I do enjoy sleeping.  At least, I seem to, since I do it a lot, and frequently roll over and drift back to sleep in the morning.  I also love a couple of cups of jasmine green tea in the morning with breakfast...it's a one to two hour ritual that makes me happy.  And a polyphasic schedule would throw all of that for a loop...though I might try kicking caffeine for a while, too.  I won't have an Asian market nearby from which to buy my Yamamoto tea, so I probably won't want to drink tea, anyway.<p>I don't read Pavlina and am unfamiliar with his arguments regarding sleep, so I don't know anything about his results.",1259137852

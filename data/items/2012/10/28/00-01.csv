It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.",1351385930

4707741,comment,4707323,4707323,3,0,mikeriess,,,"I agree with many of the points you raise, but I think you're trying to unite tangential concerns around a single issue.<p>The excerpt from your father's paper suggests that our problem solving can be inhibited by our initial impulses about a solution. I agree that this is often the case- most people seem to have a natural resistance against reversing out of a train of thought in order to choose a different branch. Our natural inertia tends to carry us forward. Even when we drive, think how awkward it feels to make a wrong turn and have to reverse down the street in order to correct your error. Obviously on the road this act puts your physical health at risk, so it's not a perfectly sound analogy, but the feeling is similarly uncomfortable with our problem solving tendencies. Most people would prefer to continue to drive and hope/wait to find a turn that will bring them back to the road they know or suspect they should be on.<p>Considering this tendency in the context of entrepreneurship, I agree that it would be inhibitory, but I also would suggest that the capacity to recognize a wrong turn and act appropriately to correct it is a necessary characteristic of a successful entrepreneur.<p>After the citations of your father's papers, you move into a sequence about how a self-contained entrepreneurship subculture might result in 'collaborative fixation'. I would argue that a central tenet of the culture, and something that makes it what it is, is that those individuals who self-select into that group de facto bring their own unique personality and background toward working on solutions to problems. If anything, the entrepreneurial subculture puts a premium on thinking differently than your peers, even if those peers also happen to consider themselves entrepreneurs.<p>Regarding the mini-terrier social network (dibs on that idea, by the way), there are always going to be individuals who copycat models and try and apply them to specified contexts. But, at least in my opinion, that kind of business doesn't exist in the same context as trying to address a Big Problem (then again, I don't have a mini terrier- maybe for some people it is).<p>I agree with you, again, about your last point regarding context. If a problem is really a Big Problem, it exists across multiple contexts, affecting a number of different people in different ways. That's why it's a Big Problem. As such, it's critical to be able to conceptualize approaching that problem from and through a variety of different contexts, and once again, that's a critical trait for an entrepreneur trying to address a Big Problem.<p>tl;dr:<p>After writing this, I'm wondering if it's not so much that the entrepreneurship subculture is inhibiting our capacity to address Big Problems as much as the problems themselves. That's why they're big in the first place right? In order to solve them, a person or group has to be agile enough to abandon their wrong answers, self-aware enough to stay true to the solutions they believe to be tenable, and diverse enough to consider a solution across diverse contexts. I think if anything, the entrepreneurship subculture encourages all these things, and if it were easy to uphold all three characteristics at any time in the face of any problem, entrepreneurship wouldn't be the art that it is.",1351384933

4707730,comment,4707475,4707685,3,0,gue5t,,,"To expound a bit more on what I said in my earlier post: the way I see it, hacking could be described as the 'outer edge' of computing/programming. Hacking is getting systems to do things they weren't intended to do. When that overlaps with a social environment the line does become very fuzzy, but for digital systems it ends up referring to programs that have some surprising and unexected attribute (examples include being tiny, being exceptionally fast, running on obscure, difficult, or new hardware, using new techniques or algorithms, being written in 'alternative' langauges [like brainfuck], performing unintended tasks [like privilege escalation or tetris-in-sed], and various others), and is more specific than ""programming"", which is increasingly often a very practical topic, as computers are embraced by more and more industries and fields.<p>A ""hack"" is almost by definition, then, not for profit and not well-funded, because it is on the edge of what's possible and quite often far outside what's useful; good business knows better than to invest in high risk, low-return projects. Compare this with the idea of Y Combinator, which if I understand correctly funds companies with high-risk ideas in the hope of achieving high return-on-investment via runaway successes. But most YC companies I hear about have minimal technical progress associated therewith. Social progress seems more their goal, in the majority of cases.<p>And please don't let it seem that I'm denigrating either mainstream programming nor funding ugly-ducking companies for social change. Hackers don't pop out of nowhere, and most can agree how important social change is. But I think it would be great to have a place to discuss hacking, and Hacker News definitely attracted many (myself included) via the implicit siren-call of being such a place. Given that it is so-named, we can work to make it live up to that standard, unless there's some other community I'm missing where such things would be more appropriate. If this is still exclusively Startup News: let pg rename it that, and don't waste hackers' headspace and search engine result space.",1351384661

(If you try raising your prices above this point, you'll make less because your sales volume will go down due to B leaving the market.)<p>But if you can price-discriminate -- figure out how much each customer is willing (or able) to pay and charge exactly that much -- you can set A's price at $C + $8 and set B's price at $C + $5 and make $13 instead.<p>The publisher's doing exactly this sort of price discrimination:  American customers are much wealthier than Thai customers, and willing/able to pay more, so they charge more.<p>The crucial point of this analysis, however, is that <i>the seller is still able to make a profit at the lower price level</i>; it's just a smaller profit.<p>So a ruling against the publisher won't greatly harm them; they'll still be able to profitably sell their books.

It looks a bit funny on Gingerbread (Android 2.3). You could try adding a fallback for browsers that don't support transitions. Probably a lot of people will check your framework on a Gingerbread device.<p>You are spot on with using bright colors for the buttons. Bright colors work much better on mobile devices, since lighting conditions are usually terrible. High contrast in general is a must due to the lighting problem.<p>Have you thought about disabling zoom? You can run into a lot of weird issues with zooming for mobile devices. Zooming should be mostly unnecessary for a responsive design, as long as contrast and font size are large enough. For example, if you look at <a href=""http://aerialmachineandtool.com/distributors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aerialmachineandtool.com/distributors</a>, I have used the following HTML in the header to prevent zooming on mobile devices:<p>> <meta name=""viewport"" content=""initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"" /><p>Can you elaborate on why you use data attributes for styling? I have used data attributes for functionality before (to bind functionality correctly onto content loaded via AJAX). However, I'm mystified as to why this should be used for CSS. It's certainly an interesting idea.<p>I had a picky issue on Chrome. When I shrink the browser width to 432 pixels and nudge it a little wider again, I see a strange black column on the right. I'm guessing that's an artifact of Chrome -- I see a lot of issues in Chrome rendering under resizing.<p>There is a misspelling. (sorry to have to mention this!) You said that ""Crystallo is talking over the world."" I suspect you meant to say, ""Crystallo is taking over the world."" In other words, ""taking"" instead of ""talking.""<p>Thanks for throwing this one into the lion's den ;-). Hope I didn't seem too critical. There are dozens of CSS frameworks out there. You do have a start on a nice framework that emphasizes clarity and contrast. If you have trouble getting traction, I recommend that you ""pivot"" and try to aim at a specific market. I think there's a market for CSS frameworks where I can drop it in for a specific application and it just works, without requiring too much modification. E.g., a CSS framework designed for map apps like the distributors map that I linked above. That's just a thought, anyway. The market of general CSS frameworks is crowded. Bootstrap and the Bourbon Neat frameworks have gotten a lot of traction, but most frameworks don't get very far.<p>Thanks for your submission!",1351384105

But I've also noticed a tendency towards making it too simple and this can lead to the sort of seeing-your-interlocutor-as-one-dimensional that OP is referring to. When it comes to ceding control of our devices to an authority, the choice hasn't always been between controlled and open, it's between Apple or HTC/Motorola/Samsung/Huawei and the mobile carrier. The situation may be improving, but it's still not great. For a host of reasons, some of them aesthetic and/or idiosyncratic, I'd rather give up a lot of control to Apple, because I know they won't give an inch of it over to Rogers, AT&T, or Verizon. It's true that buying an unsubsidized Google Nexus device sidesteps some of these problems, but large parts of the installed Android ecosystem seem to be more like feudalism than anarchy.<p>Too often I think the people on the Android side of the discussion assume that iOS folks just lack an entire collection of values around openness that they personally consider really important. The reality is that the market is big enough for similar values to be catered to differently.

People usually goes around saying ""this sucks, that sucks"". But they can not think in fixing anything. Thats why I love the SV way of thinking, every thing is possible, just stand up and DO IT.\nAlso being 35, I realize that now I have more experience than when I was 23 (obviously), and that experience allows me to take distance from the group thinking the OP mentions (and now a days is oppressive here in Spain. People cant think there is an end to the crisis, as there was an end to the crazy bubble). \nI think is a good idea to change for a time, and immerse yourself on another ambient, job, place, whatever. There are thousands of things broken that need smart energetic people to fix them, and they are not another social network.<p>edit: some typos and punctuation.",1351382464

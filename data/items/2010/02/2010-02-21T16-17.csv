1140781,comment,1140386,1140657,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"Why does the type matter? Ruby apps extensively use duck typing, they only care that #call is implemented irregardless of the actual type. Even blasdel is duck typing by implementing __call__ in his own classes.<p>> In most situations if you saw 4 classes in the system doing virtually the same thing, but you need to use a specific one depending on context<p>You don't need to use a specific one. You never directly instantiate a Method/Proc/etc. Instead of you just focus on the goal you want to achieve (e.g. passing an object's method, or maybe some kind of callable object that you received via an argument) and then Ruby gives you an object of some type that works.<p>> You just expect to call .get_address(), but suddenly find out that one of them handles only .get_customer_address().<p>This does not apply to Ruby. Method and Proc (actually I think there are <i>only</i> Method and Proc, not 4 classes as the grandparent suggested) both respond to #call. They are not two distinct types that behave completely different, they behave the same from the point of view of the caller and just have different names. Given a function that expects a Method or a Proc, you can pass either a Method or a Proc and it <i>always</i> works.",1266771479

Clearly, large companies will demand NDAs, and clearly they are unlikely to back down for a 5 person web shop.<p>We're not debating anything.<p>I'm trying to find out how the presence of in-house counsel and/or a couple of hundred employees is relevant to a legal obligation.  Yes, legal obligations come from contracts and laws and company size leads to inflexible behavior, but that wasn't the original statement.  I've quoted it below.<p>""Practically no company with in-house counsel --- that is, no company with more than a couple hundred employees --- will show any flexibility on this; they're often legally obligated to have you sign one.""",1266769336

But states can't do that now.<p>I'd say that the super-limited federal government only worked when states had a counterbalancing ability to get things done.  I'm not sure why states power has fallen to so low a level (popularly elected senate, ability for citizens to push through restrictive state constitution amendments, massing of federal money that forces policy decisions [like highways & drinking age].... etc).",1266769306

They can also tell you that based on your symptoms to call them back if the the condition continues, if you start to experience a fever, etc.<p>I've called the doctor before (talked to a nurse), and told her my symptoms and asked if I should come in -- they said that if the condition persisted then I should come in, but there were a lot of people with the same flu in the area and  rest/fluids would take care of it.<p>I think the more we can standardize medicine the better, it is a mess of a science.  With machine learning and the rapid pace of new sensor development hopefully we'll be able to get more automated care -- that can be reviewed by a doctor/nurse to make sure it's ok.<p>The economics of call centers are no different than having nurses on staff -- how many people can you treat an hour.",1266769235
1140718,comment,1140537,1140615,0,0,kellishaver,,,"Agreed. Nurse practitioners are a great addition to the medical field. They can handle most common problems and are well-trained enough to know when to refer you to someone higher up the chain. All the nurses in our school system are NPs now. This pretty much guarantees good, basic healthcare to all of the kids in the school district. They can all get their annual physical from the school NP and if a kid comes in to see the nurse and has, for instance, strep throat, the nurse do the strep test and write out a prescription for antibiotics and the parents, who may not have insurance, don't have to pay to take their kid to the doctor (granted, they still have to pay for the medication, but this is still a huge cost-saving service for a lot of uninsured families).",1266769087

Yes, I too like the <i>idea</i> of how pure Python's approach is, but look at your code; you are mostly writing methods. They should be primitive. Ruby gets a little messy, but it does it for you, so you can write cleaner code.<p>As for those four types, methods are one of the central pillars of Ruby, they are more than functions and they deserve their own type. Blocks are not a type, that's a common confusion. Lambdas are just what you'd expect, and more powerful than Python lambdas. Procs are there to support block syntax, again for convenience in the common use case, because if you used lambdas for blocks you wouldn't be able to return out of a method while inside a block such as a loop.",1266769003

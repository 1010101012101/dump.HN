I find it interesting that the F-22 seems to have gotten over most of its teething problems, but the F-35 still cannot fire its gun (needs a new software)[2].  Even when it can fire its gun, it will only have ammo for 4 seconds of firing (2 bursts)[3].<p>I think the close combat air support / tactical role should be given back to the Army (changing Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966[4] and Key West Agreement[5]) and the Air Force can deal with strategic bombing and air dominance.<p>The Air Force has been trying to get rid of the A-10 with various excuses, but the GAO recently said their budget reason were bunk[6].

In other words if you create an application using Docker container and a Weave network, that should be able to run anywhere.  And all this should be &#x27;magically simple&#x27;.  Once you have decided where to run your app, you may wish to trade portability for performance gains.  For example by using GCE networking (or Azure, or ...).<p>To date Weave achieved portability by sending some packets (inter host) through user space.  This has big benefits in terms of ease of use eg. dealing with wide area networks, multicast and firewalls.  But under load it performs worse than kernel-only models.<p>We now have Weave &quot;fast data path&quot; - <a href=""http://blog.weave.works/2015/06/12/weave-fast-datapath/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.weave.works/2015/06/12/weave-fast-datapath/</a>  ... This aims to deliver close to line performance with portability and extreme ease of use.<p>There may of course be yet more optimisations that end users wish to investigate.  If you are willing to sacrifice some portability you could certainly make use of fast networks provided by a specific public cloud.  We haven&#x27;t yet seen a strong need to support this, but it is certainly a reasonable thing.<p>(Disclaimer: I work at Weaveworks)",1435668052

Everybody on AWS today uses VPC, unless you happened to be grandfathered in to EC2 &#x27;classic&#x27;.
There is NO COST to using VPC (aside from admin over head maybe?).  It&#x27;s a huge security upgrade, as it gives you the ability to isolate things much better.<p>The specifics of HIPAA/HITECH compliance on AWS are available under their BAA (which is confidential), and do require some things that cost more money.  VPC is not one of them.<p>If you have only a quarter rack of servers and want the minimum s for physical security, yeah, you can probably make that work cheaper than AWS.  When you have a whole datacenter worth of gear and now need a more sophisticated security / entry system, etc. the argument becomes much closer.<p>With that said, you misunderstanding how VPC works and what it is makes me wonder if your pricing is coming out right: it&#x27;s really complicated to price out a full AWS cost, just as much as to price out your own costs.",1435666333

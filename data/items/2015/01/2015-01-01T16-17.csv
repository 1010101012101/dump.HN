For instance: wiretaps are administratively expensive to pursue, and so police don&#x27;t request them until they&#x27;re sure they&#x27;ve got enough evidence to win the warrant. But civilians aren&#x27;t persuaded by this logic; instead, they see it as evidence that the whole system is tilted in favor of the police.<p>It should be as disquieting (or not disquieting) in Japan as it is in the US.",1420131449
8823424,comment,8819350,8821221,0,0,Amezarak,,,"> 1: I&#x27;m unsure what constitutes a highway, what is the difference (if there&#x27;s any) to an interstate and .. what you&#x27;d call the &#x27;normal&#x27; roads between cities.<p>Very generally speaking, interstates are federally-funded/built longer roads (I-10, for example, spans from Florida to California, but there often shorter offshoots) that are usually at least four lanes total (almost always much more in metropolitian areas) and do not have stoplights, stop signs, or any cross traffic at all. Access is controlled by marked exits. The usual speed limit is 70 mph, sometimes lower or higher, often much lower in metropolitian areas with lots of exits and therefore merging. It really depends on the area, congestion, and the actual speed limit but in my experience people more commonly drive ~80mph on the interstate, at least where the speed limit is 70mph.<p>Highways are pretty much a broad spectrum. They are usually paid for and maintained by the states (although federal grants are common). Sometimes access is controlled for short stretches, but in general they have stoplights and stop signs. They are usually multi-lane and often the major throroughfares through a city are a highway. Speed limits vary wildly. There are two lane country-road highways with few stops and 10 lane metropolitan highways with stops every 100 feet. They <i>tend</i> to be fairly long but not always.<p>&quot;Other&quot; is pretty much the final category, which includes city streets and country roads. They usually aren&#x27;t very long; any sufficiently long road is usually transformed into a highway if it isn&#x27;t already.<p>The &quot;normal&quot; roads between cities are almost always interstates and highways.",1420131438

8823421,comment,8821808,8821808,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is a really interesting article (and a blog I want to come back to). Thanks, OP.<p>What Haskell seems to achieve, and I&#x27;m not an expert on it yet, is an incentive system that encourages small functions <i>especially</i> when you&#x27;re &quot;in&quot; a monad, because of the &quot;any side effects makes the whole function &#x27;impure&#x27;&quot; dynamic as seen in the type system (also known as &quot;you can&#x27;t get out of the monad&quot;). Of course, it&#x27;s sometimes a pain in the ass to thread your RNG state or other parameters (that remain implicit in imperative programming) through the function, and that&#x27;s where you get into the rabbit hole of specialized monads (State, Reader, Writer, RWS, Cont) and, for more fun yet, monad transformers.<p>I think that the imperative approach to programming has such a hold because, at small scale, it&#x27;s far more intuitive. At 20 lines, <i>defining functions</i> feels dry and mathematical and we&#x27;re much more attracted to the notion of <i>doing</i> things (or, making the computer do things). And, contrary to what we think in functional programming, imperative programming <i>is</i> more intuitive and simpler at small scale (even if more verbose). It&#x27;s in composition and at scale (even moderate scale, like 100 LoC) that imperative programming starts to reach that high-entropy state where it&#x27;s hard to reason about the code.",1420131294

8823419,comment,8822723,8822723,0,0,kaolinite,,,"A few predictions, mainly around Apple, mobile and wearables:<p>1. Apple Watch will be successful, although Wall Street will not perceive it as such, and sell over 20 million units. It will not sell in iPhone numbers and as a result will be initially dismissed as a failure by major news companies. It will be the catalyst required to launch the wearable market and sales of wearables by other companies will increase considerably.<p>2. As a result of a burgeoning wearables market, low to medium end mechanical Swiss watch companies and many lower-end quartz watch companies will see a small drop in sales. None will be in trouble yet. High end Swiss watch companies will have nothing to worry about and will likely continue to see increases in sales.<p>3. A number of Swiss watch companies will release their own wearables (Montblanc recently did this actually[1] but we&#x27;ll see a lot more in 2015) - they will mostly be ignored due to lack of features, poor craftmanship, buggy software and high prices.<p>4. Android Wear will continue to develop rapidly however there will be fewer quality apps on the platform. Many Android Wear devices will not see daily use. Tim Cook will mention this on stage at WWDC later this year.<p>5. Fitness companies, such as Fitbit, will see a decline in sales but will not be in any significant trouble this year.<p>6. Apple will improve iCloud reliability significantly, restoring some developer trust but not all. Problems with app review will re-emerge as Apple struggles to define the boundaries for the use of new features in iOS 8 (and 9) and on the new Watch platform.<p>7. Companies will still continue to mainly launch on iOS first although there will be an increased need to be on both platforms (if not at launch but soon after). This is how it has been this year, I don&#x27;t see any indication that the trend of iOS-first is going away.<p>8. Over the year, Google will increasingly control Android and the Play Store. It won&#x27;t become as strict as the App Store next year however long term users of Android will express concern.<p>9. Profitability of mobile devices will continue to fall. Samsung&#x27;s profits will decline in the face of competition from companies such as Xiaomi. Apple&#x27;s global marketshare will either stay fairly level or increase slightly however their cut of the phone industry profits will continue to increase with them making considerably more money than all other players.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/introducing-the-montblanc-timewalker-urban-speed-e-strap-the-first-foray-into-digital-wearables-is-upon-us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/introducing-the-montblanc-timew...</a>",1420131270

8823408,comment,8819085,8821124,0,0,sparkie,,,"The other kinds of configuration aren&#x27;t that much better.<p>The most common method of configuration on linux is to include a parser for one of many shitty text or markup formats (whatever is currently &quot;hip&quot;, so JSON at the moment), then carefully bind each variable you might want to modify to a key/value mapping extracted from the config file - and if you want to keep the sanity of your users, include verbose error messages or even a debugger so they can fix their inevitable typos.<p>The way configuration works on Windows and Mac is largely the same, except you wrap a GUI around the text file to handle the validation of inputs, which is a slight improvement over text input.<p>The problem with those input methods is they don&#x27;t exactly allow you to configure much. You have to decide ahead of time all of the possible variables that one might want to change - and even then, you can&#x27;t even <i>compute</i> new values to set the variables to, unless you embed an interpreter into your configuration format. As the program grows and gains more features, the configuration format needs amending, and grows uglier - which is what leads to Greenspun&#x27;s tenth rule. Configuration files have their place - but most of the time, they&#x27;re used where it&#x27;d be best to just have a programming language available.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily think dwm&#x27;s idea of configuration via C is a great idea though, since they&#x27;re not interpreting it and recompiling the whole program to make and test changes is a headache. Configuration via source code is the way to go, except it should be interpreted while the program is running, such that you only need to recompile for major breaking changes. Xmonad is configured via source code, but they have a separate process for your configuration, such that when you change it, the config is recompiled and the program relaunched without restarting the whole system. I&#x27;d personally opt to embed a Scheme into a WM, but that would probably go against suckless&#x27;s minimalist philosophy.",1420131065

Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t rely on the integrity of the signal chain outside of a very limited number of applications, like Dolby-certified movie theatres.<p>At present, stereo mixing is constrained by the need for compromise. We just don&#x27;t have the ability to accurately ascertain how the listener is experiencing our mix. They might be using mono equipment that only plays one channel or that sums both, they might be listening over a highly compressed stream or a poor FM signal that mangles the stereo image, they might be using headphones (or one earbud), or a whole range of stereo speaker systems that may or may not have glaring technical faults (channels out of phase, comb filtering due to poor placement etc).<p>A mix that creates an effective illusion of space on one system can sound downright unpleasant on another, so the main goal is compromise. You narrow the stereo image to avoid hard pans that sound unpleasant on headphones, you avoid big phase differences that would cause cancellation when summed to mono and so on.

8823289,comment,8821722,8821722,0,0,apunic,,,"Probably I am alone here but I think that Snapchat is the biggest innovation in the social space since Facebook and not just because of it&#x27;s ephemeral nature. Let me elaborate and give my view why I think Snapchat is great and one of my most used apps.<p>- To start, Snapchat changed my communication behavior heavily. Before Snapchat people used any kind of messengers when they had a clear intent to start an interaction with another person. With Snapchat you just send something. You do not want to start a conversation, often you just share what you do right now, how you feel and very often it&#x27;s so close to what you are and not some polished something you would like to be. You share emotions in forms of pics also on Instagram and Facebook but this is different since the emotions you present there are highly curated, see below for more.<p>- There are no &#x27;likes&#x27; and this is wonderful. The existence of likes sets us under pressure. If we post something on Facebook and do not get a single like it&#x27;s embarrassing and leads to postings which are only of outstanding nature painting a distorted picture of our life. Facebook is anything but not reflecting reality.<p>- Sending and selecting a few contacts is so fast and I do not know one single app which has a slicker process. This again leads to so much more honest and personal messaging. Since I target on other platform many more people I have to take care about my postings. On Snapchat I can quickly select a bunch of people and leave those out who might be bored by a single snap.<p>- The process of taking a picture is different than with the stock camera of a phone. You take a pic which is NOT saved—usually it&#x27;s immediately saved and if you do not like it you have to go the the gallery, delete it and confirm again that you want to delete it. This is very annoying if you take selfies. Snapchat turned this around and once you find the right shot you can send and/or save it. Small thing but so convenient.<p>- Features like slide-in filters, painting on the pic, amazing video calling are just nice amenities but again show that Snapchat&#x27;s interface is just great and miles beyond other cluttered UIs.<p>- One feature which I want to mention is putting text on pictures, no rocket science but again sometimes so funny and shows similarities to those meme generators.<p>- Finally, the ephemeral thing is not the key feature but it&#x27;s the brand and the DNA of Snapchat, everybody knows that there&#x27;s no privacy, people can screenshot the snaps and share it, period. But it&#x27;s about being oneself and understanding that the pictures are just &#x27;throw-away products&#x27;, no shiny thing kept forever. This again leads to a very honest snaps. Snapchat is not about looking good.<p>I encourage everyone who doesn&#x27;t &#x27;understand&#x27; Snapchat&#x27;s success to try it, it strengthens the relationship to close contacts and friends much more than other &#x27;social app&#x27;.",1420128834

This has been remarkably successful.<p>Sure, having the code is better than not having the code, but I think that gives us less security than many assume it does.",1420128719

Anodized black foil is much better than painting foil black.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the total BTUs would be any higher if one replaced the thin foil with a 1&quot; sheet of aluminum. An aluminum sheet with fins on the backside for heat dissipation might help, but I still think the total heat would be the same because the amount of energy hitting the surface is the same.<p>It is surface area and temperature of that surface that counts and we don&#x27;t need fans because of convection.<p>If you take an infrared thermometer and take a reading off a baseboard heater you will see 140-180F temps radiating off the casing and the metal fins inside that are put there to increase surface area.<p>These flat panel aluminum foil based collectors work the same way.<p>When light/heat energy enters a room through the window some of it turns to heat and some is reflected back out the window. That is why you can see objects from the other side.<p>Seeing those objects is how we lose our heat. These collectors let us capture and convert a much higher percentage of the energy coming into the window already.<p>If you look at one of these collectors through the window from the outside it appears invisible almost, they are hard to see, nothingness from which precious free energy is harnessed and consumed and not allowed to escape.",1420128627

The Amish are engaged in a constant, ongoing negotiation with the technological world, and pneumatic power is one of many remarkably clever compromises.<p>Using &quot;Amish electricity&quot; provides you with the labour-saving benefits of domestic appliances, but without the temptation of entertainment technologies like TV that the Amish see as a threat to family life. Pneumatic power serves their social goals more effectively than electricity; It is very good at providing useful work, and very poor at providing idle distraction.<p>Many Amish people now have mobile phones, but they are kept in a shed some distance from the house so that they are only used when absolutely necessary rather than being a constant distraction. It is common for Amish communities to use non-Amish drivers to transport groups of them to work by van, which provides the economic benefits of commuting while avoiding many of the negative effects that private car ownership would have on community life.<p>>Think about the brainpower and time spent into doing that.<p>For the Amish, that&#x27;s the whole point. They&#x27;re not anti-technology, but they believe in engaging with technology on their own terms, in a careful and planned manner. Many of the prohibitions and taboos that seem arbitrary are arbitrary like a speed bump - they&#x27;re designed to slow down the rate of progress and force you to think about what you&#x27;re doing.

Chicago. New York City. Sunnyvale.
Application Security Consultant<p>Full-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available.<p>The start of a new year is a time many people become a bit introspective and reflect on their lives and careers.  Those of us who enjoy what we do, and find satisfaction in our work take account of our accomplishments and achievements in the past year.  Others may be less satisfied with their current position, and resolve to improve it.  If you find yourself in the latter camp, my advice is to find a job for which you are passionate, motivated, and talented.  Find your muse; something which engages your heart and mind, and gives you a sense a fulfillment.<p>For those of us at Matasano Security, this sense of pride and accomplishment comes from assessing the security of application software.  We find few things as inately satisfying as discovering ways to abuse application logic and bend it to our will.  Better yet is the satisfaction that comes with knowing our clients can now use our information to secure their applications and protect their clients. It takes meticulous attention to detail, and the ability to think outside the box and consider cases the application&#x27;s own developers didn&#x27;t.  Application Security can be both an intriguing mental puzzle, and an extreme adrenaline rush in a way few disciplines of computing are.<p>In the coming weeks, gyms will fill up with new members intent on exercising their bodies.  Me?  I&#x27;ll continue soldiering on, breaking and helping fix software, exercising my heart and mind.

This is more like a polis, because different discussions create value for different people.<p>The latter exposes you to more new ideas, but it also wastes enormous amounts of time. (And a lot of these new ideas don't end up sticking because you haven't already tried yourself and failed first.) I think the YC model probably maximizes your chances of success after three months, but only if you already have a pretty good chance of succeeding. If you still have a bunch of missing skills you need to fill in, then looking into non-YC options might make more sense.",1264405411

1074673,comment,1074285,1074480,0,0,richardw,,,"""Because it cost virtually nothing to copy bits, the supply goes up.""<p>There's a lot more to this discussion, because it's not a theoretical 'perfectly competitive' market. Supply in the case of one product is restricted to one supplier so it doesn't mirror a normal S-D curve. In a normal supply-demand curve supply moves up because others enter the market with equivalent products, driving the price lower until there's a balance. In the case of Office, others have entered the market and, having created alternatives, the price is lower than it would otherwise be. There is a lower limit to the (price x sales) of Office below which Microsoft would have no incentive to create it.<p><i>If</i> the software market could be equated to a normal S-D curve with a single product in the market, software developers would quickly restrict the amount of applications they sell.

Probably only Sun has done enough to make this sort of conclusion--they did an incredible amount of IP research for the development of Sun OMS.

Actually, if I were to ask the question differently and say: What exactly makes Entrepreneurship so attractive? Many would say it’s the lack of a boss.<p>Entrepreneurship is very personal and if you don’t have the discipline muscle already trained and ready, the first year or two will be very hard. But after that, you simply pick up a sheet of paper in the morning, look over at your yearly plan, and write down the couple of things that you must do that day to get a little closer.<p>At the end of the day, cross all the items off the list. If you’re lucky, that is.<p>Of course, it’s much harder than that. Specially when your plan is evolving as you go.<p>From my experience, I believe what makes entrepreneurship so hard is having to fly multiple plans in the sky simultaneously.<p>It’s telling which planes are carrying the cargo and which are carrying the people.

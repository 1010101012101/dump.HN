I think there's a fair chance the strategy-path can be engineered to be:<p>(1) Publishers sign up as free riders.<p>(2) The signup bonuses and other payoff tweaks from Contenture convince a few sites at the margin to push paid subscriptions and increase the functionality gradient between paid and unpaid visitors.<p>(3) That provides enough variety and experimental information to keep iteratively optimizing conversion tactics -- where conversions are both turning unpaid users into subscribers, and turning publishers into better upsellers.<p>A site that can manage its own subscriptions can 'defect' -- but just as with running your own ad sales, there are many, many more sites that just want a drop-in solution.<p>However, the 'defection' you talk about -- shirking the shared task of creating/retaining paid subscriptions -- is subject to monetary incentives totally under Contenture's control. They design the 'black box' of payouts and can adjust the signup bonuses, the ratio of payouts for protected pageviews vs. free pageviews, and more. They can expel anyone blatantly gaming the system -- unless such gaming also benefits them. Eventually, if you're not carrying your weight, your check each month is just a token amount to remind you you could be doing more.<p>It's a subscription-revenues mirror of AdSense in many ways, and they have enough levers to adjust there's a chance of finding a self-reinforcing formula.",1243398404

But here's a small example of the sort of thing I want to do with metaprogramming in Python.<p>In C, C++, Java, and almost every commonly used language, parsing is usually done by writing a parser in a different language (yacc, ANTLR, whatever) which is then compiled to source code which is then compiled again.  In a language with good metaprogramming facilities, the parser is written <i>in the language</i>; macros in Lisp-descendants, parser combinators in Haskell (itself probably about as flexible syntactically as you can get without actually having macros), whatever the hell Forth people call it, etc.  This has, at least in theory (a lot of parser combinators in Haskell are impossibly naive, but that's an implementation detail or so I claim), no demerits over the C approach, but it integrates better with the language.<p>This is not just a difference in taste, either.  As a different example, Python had the problem wherein regexp strings were getting impossibly difficult to write.  They added raw strings to the language to get around this.  Schemers had the same problem, but one of them (Shivers) wrote a regexp language with escapes to the underlying Scheme implementation that compiled to regexps but made it possible to read them like they were any other kind of code, instead of weird terse utterances.  You can still do the weird terse utterances if you like, but you can also write regexps like they were any other kind of Scheme code.<p>When I was doing web programming in 2000, I hacked an SQL generation library in Python.  It felt awkward to use and was verbose but I deemed it better than being paranoid about SQL injection attacks.  If I had good metaprogramming facilities, I might have been able to implement the database comprehensions they have in C# now (the LINQ facilities).  I probably wouldn't have decided to do so, because even in 2000 I had some taste, but I could have and experienced all the benefits the C# people claim to have.<p>Another thing that came up during that same project was that I was trying to do what we now call continuation-based web frameworks in a language with no explicit continuation apparatus.  This is similar to what PG described doing in Viaweb, but I didn't have a metaprogramming setup to help me out with it.  I did the CPS conversion manually, and lemme tell you it was a royal pain in the arse and contributed significantly to the difficulty in implementing that setup.  If I had good metaprogramming frameworks I could CPS convert the code automatically, as PG did.<p>Would you like more? :)",1243397867

""Wow this interface is really just holding me back, I'm completely stifled by all these buttons all over the place.This interface should just be a blinking cursor""
Of course you don't, feature discoverability is an important feature that designers strive for. When you're competent at programming and you really know your editor then you boot up and you know exactly which feature you want to use and the shortcut to do it, but it's almost impossible in vim/emacs to learn these features on the fly. In my opinion IDE's can be a great way to learn to program particularly one's designed with a particular language in mind.

I think this is because it seems much more possible, on a personal level, to resist or opt out of the Huxley dystopia than the Orwell one.  Postman may have a compelling point that much of it has happened already, but it has happened through individual choices that I don't have to share -- the books are still there to be read, the tools & techniques are there to filter the information overload & focus on the good stuff.  Admittedly this is not easy, but in the Orwell dystopia it's not even a possibility.<p>disclaimer: I haven't read the book and am responding to the (likely oversimplified) line of argument presented in the comic.",1243397470

In both cases people can buy directly by entering a credit card without having an account.<p>It turns out that at least 80% of people choose to use PayPal.  Even big corporations where I thought PayPal would be an anathema choose PayPal in preference to ShareIT.<p>In cases where people won't deal with PayPal it seems like they won't deal with ShareIT either and they ask for a direct invoice.   Despite my initial expectation, I've <i>never</i> had someone tell me they specifically wouldn't use PayPal who then chose to use ShareIT, even though I do make a point of asking in cases where they insist on a direct invoice.<p>I'm not sure what any of this means, but my experience is that when given a choice between PayPal vs another provider they probably haven't heard of, they do use PayPal.

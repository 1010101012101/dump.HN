2488449,comment,2488344,2488344,3,0,mv1,,,"I've come down to a rule for wine - price correlates well with value in the $15-$25 per bottle range, you get what you pay for.  Outside of that it seems random.  Two-Buck chuck is pretty good, especially for $2.  I've also had expensive wine > $50 which was, in my opinion terrible.<p>(This is for store bought wine, for restaurants multiply prices by 2 to 4).",1303880372

While that may work with search, there are many industries where you must scale with humans, such as door to door sales. Google's insistence on their narrow vision of scale may have a lot to do with why they find it hard to make in roads with their local strategy or say google checkout. Meanwhile paypal has little problem hiring more people to provide phone support to tens of millions of customers. Google isn't special. In fact, they don't even have tens of millions of customers for most of the products that require such type of support. Sounds too much like premature scaling and overthinking on google's part.",1303880146
2488439,comment,2485033,2487522,1,0,Vivtek,,,"Nah, it's not just Duolingo.  Google is making frightening inroads where it counts - they just won a hugemongous contract from the WIPO that a <i>lot</i> of people were hoping for (I was asked to be part of the team by at least four agencies placing bids).  Statistical methods work pretty well for a lot of applications, and patents are probably one of those applications.<p>Actually, I think Duolingo is going to help the translation market for a while - anything that brings people closer together between languages is going to encourage more people to need quality translation - but they intend to train massive numbers of people to do what I do for a living.  And once that system is in place and honed on Wikipedia, they'd be insane not to employ it for placing contract translations.  The notion of employing multiple human translators and combining their input to produce a better overall output is fantastic!  It really is!  The only reason nobody's done it yet is the expense of paying for the translation multiple times - and that's just about to go away.<p>No, seriously.  I've been predicting five to ten years for the limit for the industry already.  This just tells me how right I am: things are going to start getting freaky weird for me.<p>It's about damn time, too.  I'm bored sick with translation.  I want to get back into programming anyway.  If I can figure out how to combine them, I'm going to be a happy man.",1303880145

Here's mine:<p>* The Player ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105151/ ) - Silicon Valley these days isn't much different than Hollywood.  In Hollywood, writers pitch potential hit movies to producers.  In Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs pitch potential hit websites and apps to VC's.  When Paul Graham talks about ""x meets y"" ( http://www.paulgraham.com/investors.html ), this is the movie he's probably thinking about.<p>* Ed Wood ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109707/ ) - Ed Wood made bad movies.  But God love him.  He had a passion for making bad movies, had fun making them, and somehow managed to talk people into investing in those movies.<p>* The Hustler ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054997/ ) - ""Fast Eddie"" doesn't lose because of his lack of talent but rather his lack of character.<p>* Almost Famous ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875/ ) - People that get ahead don't usually get there by clawing their way to the top.  They get ahead by the assistance of people that helped them pretty much just because they felt like it.",1303879806

However, when I tallied up the hours it would take just to get to an MVP, it was far out of my range, and far out of three people unless we locked ourselves in a room for a year. To get to an MVP. To compete with something that many businesses get with Word.<p>You can't beat Excel from the bottom up, because LibreOffice already has that world. The key in that world, I believe, is to attack at the top. Big excel spreadsheets are a nightmare to handle. There's no good way to version control. VBA is easy to turn into spaghetti code. It's expensive to develop ways to see your business intelligence data, whether by packages such as Xcelcius or custom solutions taking a developer's time.<p>It's the wrong arena to compete on price, but you need a large subset of Excel's features to get to the point where you can tackle that fish.<p>Or, you can try to make a hit in the app world to prove you have the chops so you can get investment for your bigger ideas.",1303879521

See:<p>""I do believe in the Lisp curse that the power of the language is in some respects self-undermining because it empowers the individual and so tends to attract people who don't work well in teams.""<p>And I'm sure you've read the Lisp Curse.<p>His essay argues that he's really not a great programmer, but Lisp gets him to principal engineer!

If you tell me you have some great pudding, but it tastes like cow dung, I won't be impressed regardless of how many fine ingredients you use and advanced cooking methods employed.

But to me that's not sufficient to annoint it a super\nlanguage.""<p>The post we are commenting on was by a person who was not making a\nclaim, but relaying an experience.  I will paraphrase three arguments:\nthe parent post blog link was saying ""look, I'm not an amazing\nprogrammer, but in my experience, armed with Common Lisp, I can\napproximate what I see ur-programmers do with other languages at\nGoogle.""  He in turn was replying to a person saying ""I don't think\nLisp makes you more productive.""  The ""Lisp is not really a super\nlanguage, it has nothing to show for itself, and I could make similar\nclaims about logo."" thing got interjected by you, I think.<p>""Moreover, in no field of creative human endeavor have popularity and\nworthiness been correlated. You think all those billboard top 10 acts\ncame from Juliard?""<p>""Are you arguing that for music that college serves little purpose?\nThat we're entering some type of music education bubble. :-)""<p>No, I think that's what you're arguing.  I'm saying Lisp is worthy,\nand should not be judged by its popularity, because the worthiness is\nwhat reallly matters.  You're arguing it has ""nothing to show for\nitself"".  I'm sure with a Sun Java marketing budget and the right\npeople we could make Lisp as popular as we wanted.  We could have\nwhitepapers and case studies to ""show"" as much as you like.  I'm only\nconcerned with popularity when people dismiss my arguments about\nworthiness the minute they assess the popularity.  I have the same\nproblem when I try to tell them about Sun Ra or the Residents.<p>So all that being said, to address your actual point (however\ndisjoint from the OP it might be), nobody's claiming it's a ""super\nlanguage"", just often better for the people who commit to using it\ndespite it's unpopularity.

At the project level when the productivity data is measured, it turns out productive people have averaged out the unproductive data of the other crowd.

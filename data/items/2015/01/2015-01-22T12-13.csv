New messages sent also need to be synchronized across devices, which I presume is why it&#x27;s required to keep your phone connected to the Internet.

See for example Hugh Laurie&#x27;s personal life [1,2] or Nine Inch Nails&#x27; Everyday is Exactly the Same[3] which captures that exact feeling. Or of course the wonderful Hyperbole and a Half&#x27;s account of depression[4], especially the second part makes the point that depression at its worst is a void. No positive feelings, but also no negative ones.<p>Now I made myself sad^H^H^H apathetic going through those sources. Why does Trent Reznor have to be so good at projecting?<p>As for the anxiety bit (anxiety and depression are to completely different things), the article mentions her response to having her blood-co2 levels elevated, which seems to me to be a standard anxiety response. A feeling of restlessness and dread.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Laurie#Personal_Life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Laurie#Personal_Life</a>

While you&#x27;re right on the technical details, colour vision is a bit more complicated than that.<p>Red-green &quot;blindness&quot; comes in two flavours: protanomaly (red deficiency) and deuteranomaly (green deficiency). Both can vary in their severity.<p>I&#x27;m deuteranomalous, that means I don&#x27;t perceive green as intensely as someone with normal colour vision. Basically, green always appears much less saturated to me, whether it stands on its own or as part of a hue. This also means browns will appear more &quot;red&quot; to me.<p>Additionally this means I find it much more difficult to tell &quot;similar&quot; shades of red and green (and the various hues in between) apart, especially when the surfaces are very small. I think this has to do with red and green normally having a difference in luminosity and me relying on the luminosity as an additional &quot;hint&quot; when processing the colours.<p>Also note that the reason many men with colourblindness remain entirely unaware of it is not that they aren&#x27;t affected by it but that there simply isn&#x27;t much awareness of it in popular culture.<p>My maternal grandfather was a photographer and would often ask his wife for opinions on colour matching and had a tendency to pick atrocious colour combinations for his clothing, but he never thought of himself as being colour blind.<p>Although there were a few hints in my childhood that I&#x27;m colour blind (e.g. painting trunks and leaves in the same colour, using green as a skin colour when painting &quot;brown&quot; people, mixing up blue, purple and turquoise a lot, having difficulties with colour coded maps on the overhead projector) the only reason my parents became aware of it being actual colour blindness (rather than just childish quirkiness) was that we did a couple of health tests in elementary school that included an Ishihara test.<p>Note that I never had trouble telling apart the colours on traffic lights either, although I must say that with the newer traffic lights that were introduced during my childhood I noticed the green having become much fainter (because they are brighter). It&#x27;s only now that I&#x27;ve begun driving that I notice that green traffic lights at night frequently blend into the scenery alongside the fluorescent street lights.<p>EDIT: Here&#x27;s an article showing the world pretty much as I see it: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8928770"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8928770</a>",1421929362

So the public health types were on the ball, just not quite fast enough, especially given the very long lead time required for the current major egg based vaccine (both to develop new seed strains that&#x27;ll grow well in eggs, and then production).<p>Ah, well, it&#x27;s a good time for introverts like myself to practice &quot;social distancing&quot;, made a lot less onerous by the net.

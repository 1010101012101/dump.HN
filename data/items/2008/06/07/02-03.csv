In particular, what happened that allowed you (rural high school kid with blue-collar parents) to do Westinghouse-caliber work?  Did someone approach you with a great opportunity, was it the result of tenaciousness and single-minded dedication, did you have a Homer-Hickam-style, one-in-a-million  series of fortunate events...all of the above?<p>The fact that you're agreeing with us about the overall competitor pool in these contests suggests that your experience was a pretty rare event.",1212807227

211366,comment,211273,211345,0,0,Shooter,,,"While it's very true that privileged parents/school connections help some students tremendously, good science is still good science.  Anyone with a good research idea that can execute well will be able to go pretty far in the competitions.  You don't have to have PhD parents or go to a private school to win.<p>I won several awards at ISEF many years ago, including a few full-ride college scholarships.  That was before Intel took it over completely.  I also won awards at Westinghouse and some of the DoD science competitions.  My Dad was a truck driver and my Mom was a waitress at the time.  They are 'normal' - for the most part ;-)  I also went to a small, rural high school that was definitely NOT known for its science programs.  Despite this contrary anecdotal evidence, I'll have to mostly agree with you about the background of the people that win at these competitions...although I can't speak directly to the gender issue.  (I do remember quite a few female competitors...?)<p>I was definitely the odd guy out at most of the competitions because I didn't go to a private school and/or come from a very wealthy and educated family.  I was also a little lower on the...uh...Asperger's scale that most of my competitors, to put it diplomatically.  While I was a geek at my high school, I seemed like an extroverted uber-jock at most of the competitions because it turns out that everything IS relative.  It was a very weird (but nice) change in roles.<p>They have some great awards at these competitions.  I won a trip to MITI City in Japan, for example.  It's also fun...the practical jokes that come about with that many geeks hanging out are amazing! ;-)",1212806182

If they wanted to pay Mozilla more money than Google is in order to have Live search be the default browser, they probably could. The reason they don't is that it would be a waste of money. The vast majority of Firefox users would just change it to Google the first time they used it anyway.<p>If you want something that has a tiny market share compared to other products in its field, you have to go out of your way a little to get it. This is true with every other product. Why should search engines be an exception?",1212805391

One good way to make the point.<p>Plus by reinventing, you get to own your work, you learn the problem space, you develop processes for execution, you train your team, you start collecting valuable usage data, you position yourself in the market... and all those reasons are on top of the fact that you can probably make some kick-ass improvements.",1212805160
211361,comment,211255,211255,0,0,alexstaubo,,,"Part of the reason for there not being a ""standard"" setup is that there are tons of OODBs, and they are all implemented a little differently.<p>Some of the major ones are Objectivity/DB, Versant, ObjectStore, GemStone (which comes in Smalltalk and Java flavours, where the former is a more mature and flexible product) and InterSystems Caché. Caché is the odd one out; it's object database as well as an SQL database as well as a MUMPS app server, and while it has plenty of support for things like Java and .NET, it's fundamentally a MUMPS system. To most of today's programmers it smells a bit weird.<p>OODBs have traditionally been intimately tied to the language you write your application in because they usually attempt to seamlessly add persistence as an extension of the application's object model: that is, when you create normal language objects in RAM, they become persistent on disk. As a result, you tend to pick an OODB based on the language you use, and once you've picked the OODB, you tend to stick with that language.<p>OODBs started out with C++, but automatic persistence was quite awkward and necessitated inheriting your classes from the OODB's own class libraries and doing a lot of calls to the OODB runtime. The OODB firms quickly latched onto Java when it became a serious contender in the late 90s. The reason is simple: It's really easy to make persistence transparent and elegant in Java. OODBs typically provide post-processing tools that munge the Java bytecode -- disassembling your code and adding persistence calls.<p>With persistence in place, all you have to do is set up a schema (typically by letting the OODB tools ""sniff"" your classes) and then add transaction code to your app. For all the transparency, it's actually a bit invasive, and OODBs are typically very strict about accessing instances in a transactional context. You generally don't store long-lived references to objects, and there are special requirements for sending objects to other threads.<p>As for specific products, I was never happy with any of the OODBs I tried back in the late 1990s. Objectivity and GemStone seem like the most mature ones, but they never provided evaluation versions so I could not try them out; they've got the enterprise bug, so they're expensive and not very open in terms of documentation, code availability and so on. In fact, you will have to turn a few stones on the GemStone site to even find the GemStone OODB products. If you are interested in MagLev you might want to look at GemStone/S, since it's essentially the same thing.<p>For Smalltalk there is also the open-source Magma database, which sounds promising. For Java there is an interesting open-source project called Neo (<a href=""http://www.neo4j.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neo4j.org/</a>), a ""netowrk database"" which unlike the aforementioned OODBs don't actually attempt to integrate with your application's object space; instead, you create Node objects and attach attributes to them programmatically. If you're going down this route there's also CouchDB, a pure-data ""document database"".",1212805129

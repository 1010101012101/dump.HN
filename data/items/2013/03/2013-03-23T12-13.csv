The point is that the whole conglomerate of companies is enough power to prevent competition and innovation (from the outside), to dictate prices, to dominate a whole market with whatever fits your companies strategy best. This constellation has never been good for the consumer. Nobody guarantees you that they're holding back with the fees until they can establish h.265 as the new defacto standard and then start raising fees, because eventually we'll have the same situation again as nowadays (hard decoders only support h264/265, etc etc). Again, there will be no competition, in a few years every video conference will be h264/5, every web video wil be h264, every Bluray, virtually every video.. If you have that kind of dominance you can do whatever the fuck you like. Like raising the fees and leeching the money out of companies because there is no choice. Atleast that's what i would do ;)",1364043547

Those respondents include faculty members at Penn, Princeton, Duke, and Stanford. Most of them led courses that were oriented to math, science, and engineering.""
Which makes sense, those are subjects which are probably best suited to this kind of approach.<p>I've taken a number of MOOCs, from EDx, Coursera, and Udacity. I'm an addict, always in at least one and plan to pretty much permanently keep doing them as long as it's possible to do so.<p>The 6.002x from EDx was probably the most rigorous of the ones I've done, and I felt a solid sense of accomplishment when it was over. But I don't think I should be awarded MIT credit for it, mostly due to the limited substitutions for lab work.<p>In fact, I don't think college credit would be appropriate for any of the classes I've done. However, the certificates for most of them do have meaning, and should be taken by employers as a sign that someone is likely to have some competency in the area.<p>Yes, cheating is possible, so it's not automatic, but you should always be evaluating someone's actual skills that matter to you anyway.

It seems like the goal is askew: predict who will leave so you can keep them. In every organization I've been in, some people should leave. Perhaps they're at a bad point in their lives; perhaps they're just not a good organizational fit. Whatever the reason, keeping them poisons the team they work with.<p>The approach is seriously lacking in the factors it looks at for flight-risk. Every organization has a culture: a way of going about getting work done, dealing with petty administrative tasks, behaving, talking, etc. These factors are extremely difficult to convey when hiring someone. Unfortunately, some individuals aren't always a good fit for a culture.<p>Over time, I've found out from experience that I don't like large organizations. Large organizations have a certain bureaucracy and formality that I find irritating. I left one particular organization just for that reason. My current employer is still too large for my tastes. They treat me well, the pay is fine, the benefits are unheard of nowadays. I just don't like the bureaucracy and formality.<p>One more point is that the reasons for leaving may be different in our current era of entrepreneurship.

There are many qualified coders stucks on proverbial other side of the fence for no good reason.<p>The short answers, for me, is <i>blind ass luck</i>. I did well in high school, stumbled my ass (unintentionally) into what turned out to be a prestige school, stumbled into some interesting internships with well-known companies, and as a result attracted the attention of one of the ""A-level"" tech employers, whose name on my resume put me on the correct side of the fence (the employer is Amazon, btw).<p>It's not just the resume effect - being <i>in</i> said companies also puts you in a network of people already in the camp, which opens up networking and job opportunities also.<p>Being in the right camp is a self-reinforcing phenomenon. You get jobs at a particular level, with a particular type of employer, which in turn attracts more of that sort of employer. Unfortunately, the inverse is also true - if you're outside the camp, you attract the <i>other</i> employers, and your resume begins to look less and less like a resume from within the camp.<p>None of this particularly helps you, even if it does explain why you can't seem to get into the camp.<p>Here are some tips - but keep in mind that I've been in the camp from ""the beginning"" (i.e., right out of school) so I really cannot vouch, first-hand, how well these will work for you.<p>- Network more. A lot more. Look at technologies being used within the camp (Rails, Node, etc) vs. tech being used outside the camp (VB.NET, JavaBeans, etc), and learn according to where you want to be.<p>- Go to developer meetups hosted by companies/individuals in the camp. This community maybe small in Philly, but I'm certain it exists. This will reinforce both the learning and networking parts of above.<p>- Go to events in New York City, which is the closest tech hub available to you. There are events held all the time - hackathons, conferences, etc. Go, learn, make friends, network.<p>- After you've done this a few times you've probably collected at least a few cards from interesting companies. Hit them up, see if they're hiring, or if they know anyone hiring. Considering the severe, ridiculous high-end tech shortage in NYC, you will get substantial hits.<p>- Consider also traveling to NYC and crashing an AirBnb for a few days/week. Companies are a lot more receptive if you can talk to them face to face. If you can line up a few interviews beforehand, even better.",1364042801

5427904,comment,5423485,5424619,1,0,michaelw,,,"This page <a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di</a> is a good starting point.<p>Angular makes extensive use of dependency injection.  The unit of DI in Angular is called a provider.  A provider is a function that can be injected and takes it's dependencies as arguments.  The function then performs a provider role specific action when invoked.<p>The specific problem here is when the developer relies on Angular to infer dependencies.  Angular does this by converting a function reference to a string which returns the full source of the function.  It then parses the function parameter names and resolves those as dependencies.<p>The canonical example of this is an Angular controller (which is one of the provider roles).<p><pre><code>  someModule.controller('ControllerName', function($scope, $http) {
    $http.get('/something').
      success(function(response) {
        $scope.someProperty = response.data;
      };
  });

</code></pre>
A minimizer changes the above to something more like this:<p><pre><code>  someModule.controller('ControllerName', function(a, b) {
    b.get('/something').
      success(function(c) {
        a.someProperty = c.data;
      };
  });
</code></pre>
When angular parses that it sees a symbol named 'a' and tries to resolve that as a dependency.<p>As I mentioned elsewhere, everywhere Angular takes a function as a provider it also takes an array.  The array is expected to be a list of dependency named and a function.  I've found that the DRYest way to declare a provider is like this:<p><pre><code>  someModule.controller('ControllerName', ['$scope', '$http', function($scope, $http) {
    $http.get('/something').
      success(function(response) {
        $scope.someProperty = response.data;
      };
   }]);
</code></pre>
Because minifiers don't dare touch strings, the dependency declaration is not modified.  The minified code would look something like this:<p><pre><code>  someModule.controller('ControllerName', ['$scope', '$http', function(a, b) {
    b.get('/something').
      success(function(c) {
        a.someProperty = c.data;
      };
   }]);
</code></pre>
The order of the dependency declarations matters of course because they will be passed to the function and bound to those variables.<p>Probably a longer answer than you were expecting but I hope it helps. :)",1364042639

Half of the country is in extreme poverty. Examples: Three-Year Famine, Mao's ""1000 Flowers Bloom"".</i><p>Those are internal issues, and they get to do what they please with their own citizens. Political changes (like from a humiliated colony for britain and Japan to a sovereign nation) always have a blood toll -- in China, that has 1 billion population, that toll will be bigger. Sure, a lot of those killings were misguided, but that's their issues to solve.<p>It's not like Britain didn't have its own internal civil wars in its past (or they didn't repress the Irish and the Scots). Or like it doesn't have people in poverty (heck, tons of people in England are uneducated, piss poor, living on the dole and with petty crimes). Compared to most of the affluent Western Europe, it can be argued that England does the worst in terms of poverty -- in places like Yorkshire, Bradford, et al.",1364040505

If Google Reader was so good that it made people so mad about it being shut down, and it was so important in people's lives - then it must've been a pretty good app, right?<p>Okay, so even with Reader being <i>this</i> good, the RSS protocol was still dying because most people have moved on to other ways of consuming news. So then if RSS didn't have a reader that was this good, then it would've probably died a lot sooner, and Google Reader actually prolonged its life. Without Google Reader, RSS might have died 2 years ago.<p>So I don't know what's with all this ""Google killed RSS"". Google didn't kill RSS. Twitter, Facebook and RSS' ""geekiness"" that made sure it never crossed that ""chasm"" into mainstream usage (and what doesn't grow will probably die, as nothing is constant) are what killed RSS.<p>As a side note, I'm someone who consumes a <i>lot</i> of news every day, yet I still found a service like Reader to quickly become overwhelming, and I've barely used it occasionally. As we've seen, many of these journalists actually had thousands if not tens of thousands of unread news stories in their Reader, which I think is also why not that many people were using it. It felt overwhelming.",1364040137

I don't expect more then install/unpack, run, open browser, configure (in the browser), done! And the configure step shouldn't be much more then a) set up admin password and b) point so some database. And if i only want to evaluate or only want a single-user installation i don't want to install MySQL, i am fine with SQLite or HSQL or some other database that comes with the package.<p>Downloading a .tar.gz, unpacking to /var/www, editing apache config, editing htaccess, editing some config.php, restarting apache, continuing configuration in browser, installing a mailserver to send mails (wtf) is a rather common way i have seen in the PHP world.

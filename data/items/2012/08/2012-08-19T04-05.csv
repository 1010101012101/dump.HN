4403248,comment,4401804,4402398,2,0,zmmmmm,,,"Biometric security has always been a disaster which is why real projects using it almost never end up being realized.  The article portrays it as if the reason India is the first to do this is because they are somehow uniquely able to take advantage of technology.  The reality is that the reason they are the first is that everybody realized how flawed it is.<p>In terms of liberty - a biometric id is, by definition, an ""involuntary"" identity.  It's something you're unable to change or refuse to yield, even if you choose to.  A person with a non-biometric identity can freely destroy all forms of that identity and then they cannot be identified any more by it.  They have the freedom to produce it when they wish to be identified, and to choose not to when they wish to remain anonymous.  A biometric identity is a non ""opt out"" identity.  It can never be changed or altered, and can be forcibly read by anybody with physical control over you.  Hence there is a great loss of liberty in a biometric identity, and when you really think it through, almost no advantages that can't be obtained from a non-biometric identity.",1345352301

And, in general, people get <i>very</i> upset when they feel they aren't represented at all; for example, I live in the lone county in my state that consistently trends liberal, and I know that my vote effectively doesn't count for anything state-wide or any national election, because I'm surrounded and outnumbered by far more conservative voters. This is frustrating and leads to apathy.<p>Similarly, when a significant region of the country is effectively disenfranchised in this fashion, serious problems result. And that's what would happen if we replaced the electoral college by direct popular election: a small number of coastal population centers would essentially decide every election, leaving a huge swathe of the country realizing that their votes don't count.<p>Under the current electoral system, meanwhile, candidates for President <i>have</i> to be responsive to the interests of a broader cross-section of the country in order to get elected.

Always, the head of the team made sure that you have a new workmate for a every new project. As such, you got used to know and leverage the different talents of the co-workers.

I mean, it is keeping the streets save, right? What gives a government the right to demand from someone fingerprints and iris scans, but not demand the GPS tracking or mandatory DNA samples of every citizen.<p>If we go on and just lament that this is just how it is and government has to keep the streets clean, these steps are consequential. After all a few decades ago nobody cared about fingerprints, and it was purely some crime-fighting technique. And so are DNA samples and monitoring anklets today.<p>U.S.'s tracing abilities given in the example based bank accounts or cell phones are voluntary, i.e. I can take a bag of cash and a throw away phone and government agencies would have to put substantial manpower into keeping track of my actions.

4403186,comment,4402160,4402160,2,0,trueneverland,,,"My first startup started in mid-2000s. For identity reasons, I'm not going to list the name here (I prefer to stay anonymous), but it wasn't a typical silicon valley style startup. What I mean by that specifically was while we were based in San Francisco, majority of the bay area never even knew we existed.<p>Back then, Techcrunch wasn't very well known and I am not sure HN even existed. Majority of people were not blogging yet and we never thought about getting press. Perhaps because of the way things are now, and there is a lot of information overload, there is a lot of subconscious influence on how people perceive things and thus have a specific mindset when it comes to building a startup.<p>For better or for worse, we were not originally from this area and we didn't get exposed to any of the valley related stuff (total ignorance you could say) and because of that, we took a very different route even though we were building a tech startup.<p>We didn't really have a formal launch day per say (if people signed up during the beta stages, we never denied anyone from using the product or having to wait for an invite). We didn't even originally intend the idea to be a startup. It was an idea built out of necessity and something we showed off to our friends who got interested in using the product. It wasn't until some time later that the idea of making a company out of it (note the word company vs the word startup) came across our mind. When it became clear we wanted to build a company around the product, we got our small group of friends to help bring in more people who had a common interest in the product as well as reaching out to total strangers online wherever we could finding anyone who would be interested.<p>We spent countless hours and weeks just messaging random people online from anywhere and we probably got somewhere between 200-300 people using the product (I don't remember exact count, its been awhile). And while the rest of the world didn't even know we existed, we pretty much went through iterations to improve the product base on feedback through this group. This part was also accidental. This was before we ever moved to the bay or even heard of the term lean startup. None of that existed in our world at the time. Turns out this was the best way to do things.<p>This accident formed our ""beta"" group although it was never really intended to be such and when it was much better (the product), we started to reach out to people in the industry who had influence to check out our product. This got the ball rolling for what I guess could be considered a public launch but there was definitely no set definitive idea around what a launch day was. We began attending industry events and doing everything we could to spread the word while working on the product around the clock and slowly but surely the user base grew.<p>Two things to note from this. The first is I don't know how this compares to how others did things back then. The second is this may or may not be the fastest way to grow but our product was not a consumer facing product to begin with and this was before social and sharing became a de facto and things drastically changed on how fast you can acquire users today vs then. I am only answering this base on my first startup since this is what you were asking in reference to. Things are slightly different albeit still the same in a lot of ways. Hopefully it helps in some way.",1345349850

It's the place that you have to go to get a work permit if you're not German.<p>They use a randomized system.  You don't have any idea if you're going to be waiting 10 minutes, 3 hours or even if you'll make it through the line at all before they close for the day.  Combined with the stress of the possibility of rejection or missing some critical piece of paperwork, the uncertainty adds a huge amount of cognitive load.

What if something similar held for memory?<p>The key memories that are remembered will typically have longer lapses for the older than for the younger. Cognitive expectations might then correct this gap by fudging a perception or sense of elapsed  time,  creating a quickened time lapse like effect for experiences, which  strengthens as you get older.<p>It would be interesting to ask people with autobiographical memories how they perceive time - according to my analogy it wouldn't change since they maintain most 'frames'.",1345349390

You have to check for the possibility of integer overflow and convert to double in that case.  In particular, this is useful if you want to use Javascript's bitwise operators.

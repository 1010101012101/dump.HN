Early dotcom sites where you could theoretically buy something if you could figure it out)<p>2nd generation - Features (Mobile phones with streaming TV, MP3 - all thrown in, loosely coupled, none integrated, some Internet portals)<p>3rd generation - Experience (Craigslist, MySpace (it does what their target market wants them to - peer communication), Google is getting there... Facebook is getting there, flying sheep aside).<p>In Jared's opinion, the Apple iPhone leapfrogged directly to the 3rd generation - it's not a phone, it's not a portable computer - it is a great way to kill time (everywhere I go I see people trying to kill time on their mobile phones, rarely is it an iPhone).",1203091196
116522,comment,116422,116422,0,0,Tichy,,,"Still Java-Developer here, with all the bad habits: wouldn't you properly encapsule the use of something like S3? I haven't used it yet, but I imagine I would create some kind of EncodeResourceLink class, that creates a link to a resource an can be configured for a variety of storage solutions. Then some kind of open source clone of S3 could run on my own server. If the amount of data got overwhelming, I could easily shift everything over to S3, or whatever competitors emerge.<p>Or do I have the completely wrong idea here?",1203091192

If you're product is 100x excellent but your marketing makes you 0.001x obscure, you need to play some marketing catchup.  Word of mouth is fine, but 10 users is a pretty small user base to expect them to bootstrap your growth for you.",1203090391
116514,comment,116079,116256,0,0,wallflower,,,"Familiarity matters. Attractiveness matters as well. I remember a VH-1 popup video for Fiona Apple that highlighted how many months it had taken Fiona to get from demo tape (one of her friends babysat for a music industry big-shot) to recording contract to hit single. Then it contrasted that with Newt Gingrich (7 years or something to rise to Speaker of House) and other powerful, not-so-attractive individuals.",1203090370

So find some less-shy sample users, or send someone out to a parade or something and document it.<p>Sorry I missed the screencast, but I guess that's the point of the drive-by demo: to see what casual visitors notice and what they don't. Of course, at this point, I should remind you that <i>I</i> may not be the ideal sample of your target demographic. :)",1203090182

116506,comment,116441,116441,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Somebody is wildly confused: a site which needs to aggregate login information for several dozen other sites, each of which give it permission to use only <i>some</i> features and not others, is a killer app for <i>OAuth</i>, not OpenID.<p>OpenID might play a role in the OAuth-enabled World of the Future, but I kind of doubt it. I think OpenID will continue on its current trajectory to the bottom of the sea. I'm still waiting for evidence to the contrary.<p>This suggested use case is not the evidence I'm looking for. It it touchingly naive. It is a little <i>too</i> retro. Like telnet and rlogin, this use case is designed for the primordial world of the 1970s, when all users were brothers, and the snake had not yet visited Eden, and Delirium was still Delight. You're encouraged to put all your keys in one basket, and <i>then</i> you're encouraged to share that basket freely with sites like PageOnce. Presumably you should also drop acid.<p>The funniest thing about this ""killer app"" is the implicit notion that financial sites like banks will implement OpenID within the next decade. That will be a cold day in hell. Even sites like <i>Blogger</i> don't really support OpenID logins yet, and who is trying to rob <i>Blogger</i>?",1203089588

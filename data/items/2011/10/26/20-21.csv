Most would consider these key features and selling points of the OS and as such Apple bundles them together with OS updates and corresponding yearly(-ish) hardware releases.<p>Even the stuff that you have to seek out, like installing a new launcher or keyboard from the market is hardly at the level of recompiling a kernel and wouldn't even be necessary if you've already chosen a 3rd party replacement such as Swype for typing, again updated on its own schedule via the Market.<p>I could and did do the rest (rooting, seeking out and installing custom Roms) because I enjoy fiddling with things. I don't think a JIT is the kind of thing an average person cares about, or can make decisions about its hardware requirements. I don't recommend, or see much reason, for anyone else to do it if they are not also geeks. Your phone will not disappear in a puff of smoke, on the contrary it will still silently get better without any action on your part even if the version number on the about screen doesn't tick up.<p>But the facilities that lets me do all that customisation are the same thing that lets anyone use Opera or Firefox as their main browser, set to open URLs by other apps, unlike in iOS where Safari will always be the default browser. Or to change the launcher, use a different dialer or theme my phone differently. These are all good things, even if you don't use them. And there is no need to if you don't wish to.",1319662635

3160360,comment,3160076,3160076,1,0,Shengster,,,"I'm not long on Netflix, and here's why:<p>1. Netflix is at the mercy of media companies that control the content. Media companies can basically charge whatever they want for their content on Netflix. If Netflix can't afford it, they'll let their contracts expire and people will no longer get to see the movies and shows they want to watch. Unfortunately, the pricing hikes made consumers realize that it was extremely expensive to spend $16 a month to rent 1 DVD a week with streaming, whereas before at $10 they could justify the cost.<p>2. Netflix is in a crowded market with Amazon, Hulu, Apple, Google, and the media companies themselves. Sooner or later Starz, HBO, Warner Bros, and all these other media companies may decide to start their own version of ""Netflix"" and cancel all their existing contracts entirely. This would be more profitable for them, and would essentially kill Netflix.<p>3. Poor customer relations. The Qwikster snafu significantly hurt their brand, and a lot of customers (800k so far) have already left their service. Not only are they going to have to convince their existing customer base to stay, they need to convince more customers to join, as to drive revenue growth.<p>4. Netflix is predicting that its combined loss of customers and European launch will push it into the red next year where it may stay for all of 2012, according to a letter to its shareholders. <a href=""http://goo.gl/3VdED"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/3VdED</a>",1319662457

Out of everyone I know on the course, I'm the only one that regularly reads HN/Techcrunch and has an interest in start-ups; it's also how I found out about siliconmilkroundabout.<p>The start-up path isn't at all prominent here and I think there's a few reasons for this:\nLack of presence of start-ups at recruitment/careers fairs (it's all the big names).\nThe compulsory Hi-Tech units on the course aren't done right - hours of lectures filled with slides rather than guest speakers from start-ups, case studies, or any interactive processes whatsoever. \nLittle to no communication between start-ups and students (groups or individuals) using social media or otherwise. \nEveryone sees messages posted on our CS FB group but nobody really reads the emails sent through the CS HR.<p>I think your best bet is to communicate directly with Society heads (i.e. students) such as Computer Science society or entrepreneurship society and to organise some guest speaker events. Lastly I think it's really important for students to know how they can help your start-up - specifically what skills they would need and what they would learn as well.",1319661936

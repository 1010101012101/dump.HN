I took a lot of Human Factors/Design courses in my last 2 years which gave me a new perspective on the CS that I'd been learning.<p>The takeaway for me was this: being able to see your CS degree in context of a broad range of other seemingly disparate topics ensures that you aren't narrowly defining what the degree can do for you. You can apply the degree creatively to a broad range of problems that aren't necessarily even taught in the CS department (or, for that matter, the Engineering school).",1208443889

Although I thought his examples of what a lazy programmer might be doing sucked.<p>In my experience, lazy programmers write tools to automate stuff. It's the guy that wrote YACC that automates parser generation.  It's the person that reads the yacc file and uses it to generate c/h files for each symbol, filled out with all of the initialisers specified in the yacc file.  It's the person that generates test scripts from an xml file, etc etc etc.<p>Actually, the longer I work as a programmer, the more I'm bemused by people that talk about how they never do any interesting programming at work.  If you are only doing boring stuff, then you are not doing it right.  Build a system to automate that boring stuff, that'll get your creative juices flowing!<p>In my case, I work for a company that does embedded software . As we often work on devices for which there is only a C compiler, we have to use C as the language of implementation for our product.  But personally I haven't written any C code for over 18 months - I'm using ruby to put together a whole series of tools that generate c code from, for example, UML diagrams.  There's still a bit of tweaking to be done to the C code at the end, but it is just tweaking, which improves productivity for the whole team.  Leaves us time to go and get an espresso from the cafe down the street instead of slaving away on boring projects.",1208443058

We have an existing software business (provision of encryption software) that brings in a good level of regular revenue but the income at the moment isn't stratospheric (We're bringing in around $120k per year). In the right hands this business could increase, but my main goal is I'd like to concentrate on a new startup and don't feel I can do both.  I appreciate that most people wish to sell their business for millions, but if you were after something in the region of $400-$500k where would you look? How would you do it without causing problems (ie people thinking you're up for sale)?

166329,comment,165471,166114,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Very good. That is rule one of negotiation: Always ask for more than you think you will get.<p>Rule zero is: Never be the first person to name a price. The opener is at a disadvantage: Once they offer to pay you $5, they can't credibly claim to be unable to afford $4. You can counteroffer with $15 and then -- in the simplest scenario -- offer to split the difference, ending up with $10.<p>Following rule zero can be very hard. It takes a lot of social skill to deflect your opponent's request for an opening bid. I'm not sure rule zero even applies in a lot of situations -- for example, as a consultant I often just use rule one, because your customers will often be scared away if you act like the canonical Oracle salesperson and attempt to determine the approximate size of their bank account before you even name your rate. But you can give them a rate and then negotiate the project scope or schedule. ;)<p>I'm cribbing all of this from Dawson's <i>Secrets of Power Negotiating</i>, BTW. I find that book kind of cheesy -- perhaps because, like many techies, I'm a terrible negotiator by nature -- but it's a fun way to get inside the mind of a sales guy. I wish I'd read it before I went to China. Chinese shopkeepers saw me coming a mile away. I console myself with the knowledge that the profits from my few small purchases are probably putting some very nice Chinese kids through college now... Plus, my Chinese friend was <i>highly</i> entertained by the sight of my negotiating, and that's worth something.",1208442203

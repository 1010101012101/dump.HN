Make sure you produce an alpha version to which you invite a couple of feedback generators.
Friends, family or perhaps a couple of hardcore believers.
Next step is to get a decent beta and make it open.
How open is up to you to decide.
But this is nonetheless the step where people you don't know of actually tries your app.
(be sure to make it easy easy easy to give feedback, generally people find wasting time on noble causes boring)",1257677301

929140,comment,928025,928293,0,0,ramchip,,,"But as a programmer, if you know that you have to write a parser, you should take a few minutes to google it before writing the code and see if this isn't already a solved problem. And it is, essentially; there are so many parser libraries out there.<p>I can even speak from experience on that. In my internship during my first year of university, I found myself wanting to write a little parser to read config files for my program. It would have been something like ""double myvalue = 42\nint myotherval = 20"" etc. I figured this should be a very common problem, since so many programs use this kind of configuration. Googling it let me find even better, cross-platform config libraries which use the registry on windows or config files on other platforms, and saved me from writing the parser in the first place.",1257675159

929137,comment,927908,928535,0,0,fhars,,,"No, you couldn't, that's what this subthread is about. A PRNG with 32 bit entropy will only ever produce 2^32 different sequences of random numbers and so only 2^32 different shuffles.
If you want more, you must introduce more entropy, either by using a larger PRNG, or using a hardware RNG. Calling the same PRNG fro diffferent threads (don't forget your synchronization primitives!) might also work as a cheap source of entropy but will likely have either bad statistical properties or horrible performance: for it to make a real difference, every single shuffle of a deck must be interspersed with many calls to the PRNG from other threads. If calls from other threads do only happen between shuffles, all you gain from introducing shared state concurrency into your program is that the same 2^32 permutations are generated in a different order.<p>But, as I  remarked earlier, if this is just for a game that is for fun where opponents can't cheat you or other players out of large amounts of money by predicting which permutations may or may not occurr, you may get away with whatever PRNG you have at hand and only swap is out once many players start to complain that they had this very hand one or two billon games ago.",1257674696

At the worst, this is an increase of 2.5% in your taxes unless you do something (buy insurance) to avoid it.  They might well call it a fine but in both cases its just paying a percentage of what you make.  You might not like this increase, but thats a separate point.<p>Let me know if I'm missing something though...<p>Edit: I think they are calling it a fine so that people will avoid it as much as possible in an effort to make sure people purchase health insurance.",1257674516

139691,comment,139641,139686,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>SMP-at-the-expense-of-UP</i><p>This is an interesting topic, actually.  When the process of improving FreeBSD SMP got underway seven years ago, the initial work <i>did</i> hurt UP performance by 10-20% -- enough that in FreeBSD 5.x and FreeBSD 6.x, there are two kernels shipped with the release: the GENERIC (single-processor) kernel and the SMP kernel.  In FreeBSD 7.x, however, we're back to only shipping a single kernel -- one with SMP enabled -- because the performance penalty on UP systems for having SMP enabled is practically nil.  FreeBSD SMP development started out needing a lot of faith to say ""we know that we're making things slower every day, but it's going to pay off in the end"" -- and while it turns out that the team which decided on a fine-grained sleeps-and-spins locking structure were correct, I can't fault Matt for not having as much faith.<p><i>ports is waved around as a solution rather than the very serious problem that it really is</i><p>The FreeBSD ports system works very well -- as long as you don't mind compiling everything from the source code.  Binary packages... yeah, there are issues there.",1205830579

It doesn't matter if karma is infinite, because there are a finite number of socially approved participants. This is why national currencies have value in the first place: because valuable organizations/individuals use them to transfer wealth. Money is just a communications medium, after all. One stuck in a pre-web mentality. Existing web currency manipulation systems are as primitive as a YouTube that only played TV in your web browser.<p>If you make karma transferable and allow negative values (thus creating debt and preventing runaway inflation), you could offer a genuine relativistic currency, in that individuals could back up the worth of their unit independently, without relying on trust in someone else (e.g. the state apparatus).",1205829611

I have realized it is just a measure of how much I post here.<p>I'm very curious what the karma->cash conversion rate is. The only reason I haven't put the auction up yet is I feel the rms username is damaged because of my disenfranchisement. If 30 days from the original incident pg won't restore my voting rights, I'll ebay my account anyways.",1205828988

Matt Dillon, a long-time FreeBSD developer (and all-around impressive guy, though this episode in history isn't his finest hour), had some disagreements with some other long-time FreeBSD developers, and one of those disagreements, perhaps the most important one, was over SMP and the direction FreeBSD was moving with regard to SMP-at-the-expense-of-UP performance.<p>So, the irony lies in the fact that current FreeBSD is faster than current Dragonfly in both UP and SMP environments.  If one were keeping score, it would be:<p>FreeBSD core developers: 1<p>Matt and his ""screw this, I'm leaving"" crew: 0<p>To be fair, Matt has been willing to talk about some major issues in FreeBSD that are considered verboten by others.  Package management in FreeBSD, for example, is a joke, and ports is waved around as a solution rather than the very serious problem that it really is.  (No fault of cperciva's, as he's done the only really good thing in FreeBSD package management in years in the form of freebsd-update.)<p>Not that I have any strongly held opinions, or anything like that.",1205828537
139685,comment,139641,139641,0,0,cperciva,,,"A bit of background information here about FreeBSD: For pretty much all of 2001 through 2006, FreeBSD kernel development was centered around making SMP work -- getting rid of the ""Giant"" lock, and thereby making it possible for multiple CPUs to be operating in the kernel at any given point.<p>Starting about a year ago, several prominent FreeBSD developers started looking very seriously at performance (how fast FreeBSD is) and scalability (how much faster FreeBSD gets when you have more than one CPU).  A key part of this was putting in place the necessary test infrastructure to allow FreeBSD and Linux to be compared -- most of the dramatic performance improvements over the past year have resulted from noticing that Linux does better than FreeBSD on a particular benchmark, and tracking down why.<p>At this point, FreeBSD scales linearly (or until it hits hardware or application performance limits) up to 8 CPUs on pretty much every benchmark available, but on some benchmarks doesn't scale very well with 16 CPUs.",1205827694

I'm just thinking what a frightening thing it would be for an empire builder like GWB to have a conscience-less army of mechanical killers.  At least our armed forces generally want to avoid killing innocents.  Big Dogs with M50 machine guns don't care about such fine distinctions.  So, yes, it could be scary.<p>Now, of course, as soon as these are available to the general public, I fully intend to exercise my second amendment right to own robotic death machines.  That's in the constitution, right?",1205827658

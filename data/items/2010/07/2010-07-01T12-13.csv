After all, you wouldn't be working for free. Sure, there is always the exception to the rule - the person that isn't interested in money at all. But in general money is a pretty good incentive for doing something.<p>The salary that a company offers might not be listed in a job offering, but the culture and many other factors are neither. And even though they are not listed you probably heard of companies with a great culture etc. Don't you think the same is true for salaries?",1277986810

The problem of low-quality patents is exacerbated by a litigation system that yields unpredictable and often overcompensating damages determinations, which divert investment and resources from innovation.""<p>""This new legislation contains a combination of provisions that will improve patent quality; will provide a more efficient mechanism for administratively challenging the validity of patents; and will provide more discipline and certainty in damages calculations and willfulness determinations.

You don't need to annotate anything.<p>Secondly it works on impure functions! (as opposed to pure functions like fib.) It tracks data dependencies through the program, including global variables, external files(!), etc. If they do not change, then it uses a cached value.<p>Assuming that it works as he explains it in the video, this is properly amazing (and I've a PhD in compilers).<p>In comparison, a memoization decorator:<p>- requires you to annotate functions,<p>- can be accidentally put on functions which are not pure, which would lead to bugs and unsafe behaviour,<p>- does not (safely) support functions where data in the body of the function changes (such as global variables, external files, etc).

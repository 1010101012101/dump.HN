When a 3 lb terrier starts barking and growling at you, you have one reaction, when a 175 lb rottweiler does the same you have a different reaction. Those situations are, on their surface, exactly the same. You are being threatened by a dog. But the realities of the two situations are very different because what is at stake. The terrier can be kicked across the room, the rottweiler will likely kill you. It is really impossible to know how you are going to respond until you&#x27;re actually in the situation.<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, for a lot of people there are things worse than dying. And for many of the people I&#x27;ve known letting down people who are depending on them ranks pretty high on that list.<p>Musk is very different from &quot;most&quot; people. We know this because he has been in the fire and we&#x27;ve seen the result. Look at the stories of the fall of the twin towers on 9/11. <i>Most</i> people paniced and froze, a small number of people took action and evacuated.<p>At the critical stress level, when your limbic system cannot take it any more, it takes over. Some people become rabbits, some people become tigers, and the really weird thing is that I don&#x27;t think you can really have any idea which way you&#x27;ll go <i>until</i> you experience it. You can believe you will do one thing or another, but you don&#x27;t really know. Scott McNealy shared with me that all you could do as a leader was to put people into really stressful situations, to see where they broke, and then note which side of the coin they fell on. It is why the armed forces put new recruits in to actual life threatening situations, to watch them panic and evaluate their response.<p>I don&#x27;t know Elon, but if he is as characterized in interviews and by third party accounts, I don&#x27;t think he altruistic so much as he is driven. The most amazing person I have ever met in person who is truly driven was Dean Kamen at one of the FIRST competitions in San Jose. It seemed like he could live to be 150 and still not get done all of the things he was driven to do before he passes. It isn&#x27;t about altruism and it isn&#x27;t about wealth, it is all about getting the important thing done. What ever that is. And someone who is driven AND functional in the face of extreme stress, is, in my experience, a rare individual.",1431665353

So not just a convention but what the spec says.<p>BUT lets take it further. Lets say you do allow partial updates with a PUT. Can you guarantee that your resource&#x27;s state will always be internally consistent?<p>Say you have two clients, both doing partial PUTs and do the following:<p><pre><code>    Client 1: GET /foo\n    Client 2: GET /foo\n    Client 1: PUT /foo {&#x27;bar&#x27;: 1}\n    Client 2: PUT /foo {&#x27;baz&#x27;: 2}\n</code></pre>\nIs the foo resource is a consistent state? For some applications it could be but for many it won&#x27;t be. And worse for some applications it may not be idempotent and a client&#x27;s proxy is going to silently retry a PUT that isn&#x27;t safe to do so.<p>So by allowing partial PUTs we&#x27;re requiring the developer to consider all combinations a resource could be updated.

That&#x27;s nice and all, but it&#x27;s not an extraordinary revolution.</i><p>Rockets didn&#x27;t cost $400 million before SpaceX.  You could already get a satellite into geostationary orbit for about $70 million -- or rather, you would have been able to, if politics hadn&#x27;t intervened.<p>Twenty years ago, the Chinese were major players in the launch services market.  They picked up quite a bit of business after the <i>Challenger</i> explosion.  One of the two commercial satellites that was retrieved by STS-51A was re-launched on a Chinese rocket.  One-fifth of the original Iridium constellation was launched on Chinese rockets.<p>In the late 1990s, the United States banned launches on Chinese rockets if the satellite had any American parts.  That meant that no Western satellites could be launched on Chinese rockets.  What happens to prices when the low bidder isn&#x27;t allowed to bid?  You guessed it.<p>What SpaceX has accomplished so far is to restore prices to where they would be <i>if the Chinese had stayed in the market</i>.  It&#x27;s impressive that they can match &quot;the China price&quot; from California.  However, it&#x27;s not exactly revolutionizing the industry yet.<p>A large communications satellite costs hundreds of millions of dollars.  A large military satellite costs over $1 billion.  Launch costs are simply not the constraining factor in the satellite industry.<p>However, SpaceX is promising to drive costs even lower through reusability.  Then we&#x27;ll see if there&#x27;s actually as much price elasticity in launch services as Elon Musk is expecting.  That will ultimately determine SpaceX&#x27;s legacy, whether it is a revolution or not.<p>> <i>If you want to see some sci-fi magic, just look at the Space Shuttle, That&#x27;s some amazing witchcraft right there.</i><p>A reusable spacecraft that costs more than an expendable launcher?",1431663416

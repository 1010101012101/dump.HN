5273188,comment,5272923,5272923,10,0,thezilch,,,"My take away from this article, contrary to the conclusions of the author and ""scholars"" is _the software used must suck_. There is no reason the software can't be something you ""boot"" into and disallows the so-called distractions, if that is really an issue. There is no reason a e-book can't be just as easily marked up and bookmarked (with adequate ""flare"") for revisiting. Not to mention all the benefits of a digital book not compared in the article (eg. Search).<p><i>Paper textbooks permit students to have unlimited access to information at any time during a course as well as after the course ends.</i> Laughable. I have no idea what hardware or software these students are being forced to use, but given statements such as these, it sounds like they are getting your typical DRM and failware cruft we've come to expect from our modern Bloatware OSes. Do these ebooks come with impossible-to-remove stickers around the screen too?",1361689018

5273183,comment,5273014,5273014,1,0,tsurantino,,,"I think that the author is correct to an extent. One thing that Pinterest has done is set a precedent for successful design thats predominantly visual (images, videos, media). This improved the standard of either glossy buttons or text in general. It made navigating content a much more engaging experience than it was before.<p>So while I do think that some websites are using the layout excessively or incorrectly (and some just straight up copy, like Pinchit) - there is a lot of value in the direction that Pinterest has chosen in displaying its content. It's one that has reflected a ripple effect in web design, as photographic and video content effectively grabs the user's attention on other platforms (ie. Facebook).<p>As always, the take-away is that we need design with purpose and must be evaluating its effects. Not arbitrarily hopping on trends just because.",1361688860

People are much less inclined to stay within the same company for most of their lives anyway.<p>Personally I never cared too much for a company culture. I don't join a company because of a culture. I join it because the projects are interesting, the money is good, the benefits are nice, etc...<p>I do feel the approach Yahoo is taking is bad for the company. I'm sure for some work it's good to be at work in the company offices, but for some other work a home environment works much better. In most companies I've worked I always got bothered by other employees, making it much harder to concentrate on tasks. Since june last year I started working with a friend on our start-up and I thrive much better in this environment. Now I work from home and the silence and serenity helps me achieve much better results. I should note I have no wife or kids, just 2 cats, so very little distraction there.<p>A company like Yahoo should realise that some employees will deliver much better results when giving them more freedom. One example could be Bill Atkinson, who delivered great work for Apple, yet did most of his work at home:<p><a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt&characters=Bill%20Atkinson&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=medium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&s...</a>",1361688523

Furthermore, I find that the (paid) virtual host desktop solutions on OSX are much better in terms of performance and integration than their windows counterparts - probably because of higher demand, possibly also because of architectural reasons.<p>But maybe you have found a way and you can then prove me wrong: Does iWorks work in your virtual box VM?

In the case of murder, they obviously weren't able to prevent the crime.  As it stands, the sheer amount of crime we have speaks to the ineffectiveness of our existing police departments, and while they could almost certainly be made better, they can't likely be made perfect.<p>In the case of an assault against me, my home or my family, my call to the police is not going to be made until I have at least assured the relative safety of myself and mine enough that making a call would be prudent.  This means that, if someone is pointing a gun at me, if you give me the choice of whether I should have a cell phone in my hand or a firearm, I'll take the latter.  Police are the first responders, but I believe that self defense is a personal responsibility, especially as Warren v DC[1] concluded that the police aren't under any obligation to protect me, despite whatever slogans may be painted on their vehicles.<p>Of course, this ignores that nobody should have to defend their purchase of firearms in the US to anyone.  It's a Constitutionally enumerated right, and according to our founders, a ""natural, God-given right"".  Ignoring the theistic rhetoric, that means that I am able to possess a firearm, and most definitely for the purpose of self defense.<p>If you could figure out such a way that would prevent me ever needing to use a firearm for self defense, as well as ensuring a means to prevent government tyranny, then perhaps I would consider relinquishing that right.  Until such time, I will exercise that right lawfully and responsible and hope that I never need to use a firearm in defense.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia</a>",1361685888

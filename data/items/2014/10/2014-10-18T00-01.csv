8474238,comment,8471786,8473705,0,0,Meekro,,,"I tried googling for lies told by DARE, but it&#x27;s hard to find anything more substantial than third-hand accounts on Yahoo answers or something (that cop said if you smoke a joint, you might DIE, dude!!!) What little I did find [1] makes me think that the information they gave was substantially true, or at least probably true. For example, there&#x27;s the strong connection between drug abuse and crime, something any policeman or apartment landlord could confirm for you. You can probably dig up some example of a lie they did tell, but all I&#x27;m saying is that, by-and-large, it was true.<p>&quot;One positive experience&quot; with drugs could, indeed, have wrecked my life, but that one experience would never happen and <i>could</i> never happen. The reason is that I wouldn&#x27;t have done it, pushy friend or no, because I believed what the adults in my life were telling me. Parents, teachers, and DARE officers all said substantially the same thing, and when only idiot kids were telling me different, weighing the relative trustworthiness of those groups was not especially difficult.<p>There&#x27;s nothing arbitrary about this. It&#x27;s called sound reasoning, and part of it is not taking reckless risks. There&#x27;s a common myth that kids are incapable of it, but I suspect that the truth is closer to them choosing not to practice it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mic.com/articles/92675/the-5-big-lies-that-d-a-r-e-told-you-about-drugs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mic.com/articles/92675/the-5-big-lies-that-d-a-r-e-to...</a>",1413593893
8474236,comment,8473771,8474091,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> This means that more criminals who are legitimately guilty will walk, which means that all of us will be less safe.<p>Serving prison time actually increases recidivism (by increasing debt, straining or severing ties with family and community, creating ties to other criminals, making it harder to find a job, etc.), so it turns out that in practice sending criminals to prison makes us less safe.<p>> The entire system is built around the idea that law enforcement can search and seize evidence if they have a lawful warrant from a duly appointed judge. Unbreakable encryption fundamentally threatens that framework.<p>Putting aside that the system doesn&#x27;t actually work, it also doesn&#x27;t require anything you&#x27;re suggesting it does. Searching a suspect&#x27;s mobile device is far from the only tool law enforcement has -- and it&#x27;s one that they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have a decade ago, so suggesting that not having it would cause the world to descend into chaos is disingenuous.<p>And the way the system actually <i>does</i> work is by creating a nontrivial possibility that committing a crime will result in punishment, thereby deterring the large majority of prospective criminals. This doesn&#x27;t require anything even resembling 100% enforcement effectiveness. In fact, its actual effectiveness is almost irrelevant because people have no sense of its true effectiveness and the deterrent is based entirely on what prospective criminals think would happen rather than what would actually happen.<p>That is one of the reasons why the system is so broken -- the deterrent is effective even though the system isn&#x27;t, so people think it&#x27;s working and nobody demands that it be fixed.<p>> There are ticking bomb scenarios and other time sensitive situations.<p>Hollywood has confused everyone into thinking that ticking bomb scenarios are common. They are not. In the overwhelming majority of cases, law enforcement investigates crimes <i>after</i> they&#x27;ve been committed, not before. Basing major policy on something that occurs in a negligible percentage of cases is just silly.",1413593878

8474220,comment,8471874,8473775,0,0,scobar,,,"First, thank you for your thorough response. You have more experience than I do in this domain, and I really appreciate you taking the time to offer your insight.<p>> With any high concentration CPV system, you will not generate power and potentially melt/destroy your rig if you do not have an accurate tracking system, which are expensive and often require constant maintenance.<p>For the tracking system you mentioned to protect the rig, do you mean sensors to monitor energy throughput/system temperature/etc.?<p>> Quantum dot solar cells basically don&#x27;t exist outside of theory. The highest efficiency I&#x27;ve heard coming lab examples is somewhere below 10%. Multi-junction cells, although expensive, do exist and are obtainable(spectrolab, etc).<p>Do you know if the reported efficiency of quantum dot solar cells is based on input of the entire solar spectrum or from a single frequency? Do you know if multi-junction cells (or a different technology) would convert a laser into electricity more efficiently? As I understood it, multi-junction technology was specifically designed to better handle multiple wavelengths.<p>> In reference to your comment related to shifting the light to a specific frequency: It is very difficult to shift the frequency of light, and there are losses and limitations ( see raman shifting). If you could design a system to shift wide band EM radiation to a single band, cheaply, without significant losses, you would have revolutionized no just the solar energy sector, but a great many other industries as well. I have seen prismatic systems which split light into different bands, each which are channelled to a solar cell with a matching band gap, but once again, the cost and loss made this approach uninviting.<p>Achieving a wide-to-single band shift with minimal loss was the mark I was aiming for, and I hope someone figures this out in my lifetime. I&#x27;m curious to see how near or embarrassingly far I was from the target.<p>> In short: How does this unit track the sun, as that&#x27;s the first hurdle to handle with any CPV solution. Then what are your optical losses? What&#x27;s LCOE can be expected from this sort of design and how does that compare to a 1-sun type module bench mark. What are the benefits of this design of current designs? If you are looking to build a product, you should define a MVP: a simple demo that can demonstrate value to somebody. If you are trying to assist the world in general with intellectual philanthropy, I would better define how this system could be expected to perform, and how is it better/cheaper/whatever-er than the current systems.<p>I was taking the &#x27;intellectual philanthropy&#x27; route, but I really am curious to learn my inaccurate assumptions and misconceptions about the idea as well. The first metrics I&#x27;d like to test are the energy lost between the solar radiation input and laser output as well as the amount of loss recuperated by converting the waste heat to electricity or a laser. If the efficiency were not substantially better than directly pumping a NdCrYAG laser with solar radiation, then the idea would not be worth pursuing.<p>My underlying goal with the idea was to reduce the cost of electricity and reduce consumption of fossil fuels to produce electricity simultaneously. Thank you again for your input and your time.",1413593520

In addition you can execute arbitrary code on these objects at any time, even while a program is running.<p>Trace Dialog[1]: Most Lisp implementations already provide a way to trace procedures. Tracing normally consists of printing the input and the output as each traced procedure is called. Slime provides something much more powerful. Slime&#x27;s Trace Dialog is similar to trace in that it creates a buffer of the input and output, but instead it is provided in a tree menu format. In addition it is possible to inspect all of the values in the Trace Dialog with the inspector.<p>Debugger[2]: When an error is thrown in a program, a window pops up which provides several things. You can click on a stack frame to see all of the variables in that frame and then inspect those variables with the inspector. You are also provided with a list of restarts[3]. In addition, you can return a value from a given stack frame, or retry a procedure call on the stack frame (you may have modified the definitions of some procedures before you did this), and have the program continue as if nothing had ever happened.<p>There are also many other features, such as the ability to macroexpand code by clicking on it, to look up every procedure which calls a given procedure, to look up every place in which a given variable is set, and many other awesome features.<p>[0] <a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Inspector.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Inspector.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/SLIME-Trace-Dialog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/SLIME-Trace-Di...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Debugger.html#Debugger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Debugger.html#...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Common_Lisp/Advanced_topics/Condition_System#Restarts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Common_Lisp/Advanced_topics/Con...</a>",1413592266

Just because someone can notate music incorrectly doesn&#x27;t mean that sheet music is a poor format.<p>The fact that tabs imply a certain fingering is a larger benefit than an issue. Many riffs are only realistically playable with one specific fingering, and a tab can help you figure this out much more quickly than you could with your ear or notation alone.

From the &quot;outside&quot; the universe is a infinitely dimensional, phase space that evolves deterministically through time.<p>That way I reason about it is that the big bang was a single &quot;pixel&quot; of super high energy in an infinitely dimensional phase space and the laws of physics are a Hamiltonian &quot;kernel&quot; that evolves the phase space in a similar way to the heat equation. Thus this kernel acts on the phase space from the big bang, mechanistically acting out the laws of physics, all the way until the heat death of the universe: effectively the fixed-point of the universe kernel.<p>This may all sound like bullshit to a physicist, but it&#x27;s the application of my limited understanding of physics and mathematics to the thought experiment.<p>Good reading here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesi...</a><p><a href=""http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/mathematical.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/mathematical.html</a><p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0646"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0646</a>",1413591581

I suppose that people that are choosing to play these mainstream violent games a la Call of Duty and the ones the feminists are talking about may be negatively influenced by them, but I&#x27;m more in the camp that the video games let us immerse ourselves into worlds where we can just enjoy and challenge ourselves, and take part in amazing creative stories. They are sort of virtual reality books, and books have the same spectrum of playing with our human and animal mind, appeasing to us however we are instinctively prone to being appeased.

They&#x27;re worse than useless; they actually decrease the performance of your system.<p>The OS is actually remarkably good at managing memory. Like, staggeringly good. Especially in Yosemite. Beyond that, the OS actually <i>wants</i> to keep as little RAM &quot;free&quot; as possible. &quot;Free&quot; RAM is wasted RAM. It uses that RAM to store memory that might be used again in the future. That&#x27;s what &quot;Inactive&quot; is; it&#x27;s memory that is not currently being used, but contains stuff that may be used again, and if it&#x27;s not, that stuff can be thrown out in order to provide the memory to another application.<p>And yet, the application you linked says that its primary purpose is to &quot;purge&quot; this inactive memory. That&#x27;s counterproductive. If another app needs it, the memory will be given to that app whether or not it&#x27;s been &quot;purged&quot;. The only thing that &quot;purging&quot; it does is remove the ability to reuse the original contents of the memory.<p>I&#x27;m guessing this is why Activity Monitor in Yosemite doesn&#x27;t even list &quot;Inactive&quot; memory anymore (or &quot;Free&quot;). Instead it has &quot;File Cache&quot;. On my iMac right now, with 20GB of RAM, the &quot;File Cache&quot; is &quot;11.02GB&quot;. And that&#x27;s <i>fine</i>. That&#x27;s <i>great</i>. It means if any of the cached file data is needed, it&#x27;s already in memory. That&#x27;s vastly better than leaving it around as &quot;free&quot; memory.<p>Every modern OS behaves this way. It&#x27;s deliberate, it&#x27;s absolutely crucial for good behavior, and &quot;memory clean&quot; apps do nothing but <i>hurt</i> the performance of your system.<p>So don&#x27;t use it.",1413591163

Unbreakable encryption fundamentally threatens that framework.<p>An example the FBI used is a stupid criminal kidnapping a child and leaving their encrypted phone behind somewhere. Even if the FBI got warrants from multiple respected judges, they couldn&#x27;t go through that phone to look for clues about where kidnapper may have taken the child.

(note that the last two are easy for me to indulge on, I just have to watch)<p>* I Make 24 eggs at a time as a fritatta, make a pork shoulder in the oven, braised chicken thighs, oven roasted whole chicken, big batches that have many servings.<p>* I used to eat cereal every day, I but got over that quickly enough - now it&#x27;s just 2 eggs each morning (slice of fritatta).<p>* I like hamburgers, but usually just eat them plain with a few pickles on top. less messy, and frankly you taste the meat more.<p>* I gave up beer completely, which I used to drink with pizza.  Now its just red wine once in a while.<p>I don&#x27;t go out to restaurants much because frankly we have better food at home and admittedly they&#x27;re not usually low carb oriented.  But you can always get a burger without the bun.  Or a gyro plate.  Mexican fajitas (hold the tortillas and chips) are a winner too.<p>I started off reading the wheat belly blog, and after I lost 10 pounds I bought his book.  I also recommend &quot;The art and science of low carb living&quot;.  There&#x27;s also great vids on youtube of atkins & LCHF stuff.  I also read william banting&#x27;s old pamphlet for inspiration.",1413590612

That physical particles in the brain don&#x27;t behave according to currently accepted physical model – but the non-physical mind has the ability to &quot;push them&quot;. For example, the supposedly random quantum phenomena may not be random but affected by our mind. It probably sounds crazy but I believe there is a reasonable argument backing this. A very brief summary – 1) mind is non-physical (see hard problem of consciousness) but physics can affect the mind 2) and the mind can affect the brain because otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be realize that mind is non-physical.",1413590602

The FBI lamenting unbreakable phone encryption and the accompanying media buzz borders on farcical and is disingenuous given that there is still a backdoor on the iPhone[1] on port 62078.

Regulators are focussed on the externalities associated with short-term tenancy operations in general, which is why they have imposed regulations imposing safety and other constraints on such operations to mitigate the externalities, as well as imposing taxes to internalize the unmitigated externalities by shifting the costs on to the operations benefiting from the activity that produces the externalities.<p>What you perceive as focus on Airbnb is just the general focus on short-term tenancies being made manifest in a particular way because of a high-visibility group of people flaunting the rules that result from the more general focus on short-term tenancies.",1413590459

727558,comment,726922,727102,0,0,dbz,,,"That's a pretty neat question. It's not ""Why would anyone like a company,"" but ""Why would anyone <i>want to</i> like a company"".\nAn example of why one might want to like a company is for when he or she is buying stock. One doesn't have to like the company, but it can influence the decision of buying if one doesn't like the company. I'm not saying that I would never buy stock for a company I don't like, but the decision of spending my money comes much easier if I like the company. However, there are flaws with that argument seeing as my liking the company could potentially cause me to over-invest and lost my money because I thought I would buy stock for the company I liked.\nThere are pros to why someone would like a company; however, like in the example I showed above, there are equal cons.\n<i>But</i> if you <i>own</i> the company. I see reason to <i>want</i> to like it =]",1248763879

And speaking of pots and pans, Cuisinart makes a great set of pots and pans, covering everything you need, that sells for $149 from Amazon.  That, and a good knife, and a few other bits and pieces, are most of what you need to have a nice cooking kitchen for dinner for a group of up to about four (and the two small ones are good for single and double meals).<p>To put things into perspective, I don't even own a microwave.  But, I consider a rice cooker absolutely mandatory if you eat rice regularly.  If you don't eat rice regularly, then obviously a rice cooker is not a useful expenditure or use of space.  I consider it a good investment of both, because my most common meals are various kinds of Chinese, Indian, and Mediterranean foods that include rice as a base.<p><i>Even if it makes oatmeal and rice, that's basically just a bunch of starch. Might as well just eat Ramen.</i><p>I'm not a believer in the Atkins anti-carbs crusade, nor do I accept that all grains are created equal.  Oatmeal and brown rice are both quite reasonable ""slow"" carbs, when combined with proteins and vegetables.  Ramen is not a slow carb by any stretch of the imagination, and is actually ""just a bunch of starch"" (it also has <i>way</i> too much sodium, if prepared as directed).",1248761635

727526,comment,725997,726767,0,0,ewjordan,,,"If I had to guess, the explanation of the actual theory has been irretrievably butchered (""popularized"", if we're being nice), which is why it doesn't make much sense as stated.<p>In general relativity, ""time"" plays several different roles, and you need to be more specific about which one you're talking about.  You're usually talking about either proper time, which is the spacetime distance measured along a timelike curve (and also, up to a sign, the actual stopwatch reading you'd obtain by traveling that curve), or the coordinate time, the direction in spacetime that's the odd man out and has the ""wrong"" sign in the metric signature.  This second definition (coordinate time) is wiggly, because there are infinitely many coordinate systems that you could pick to describe the same spacetime, each of which will use a different definition of coordinate time, and general relativity's main insight is that all of these coordinate systems are equally valid (actually, it says that the equations describing spacetime don't even change when you switch coordinate systems, perhaps one of the most profound discoveries in all of physics - if you add in the observation that curvature is caused by matter, you have almost enough in those two observations to construct the entire theory of general relativity from scratch).<p>Any physicist working in the field is intimately familiar with the subtleties here, and certainly knows that ""clocks run slower"" is a meaningless statement unless you're talking about speed relative to some other measure.<p>The gist of how time could run at a different speed is that if the time component of the spacetime metric was halved along your path, your stopwatch would tick off half as much time as you'd expect it to.  But that's a very artificial scenario, because it presumes you have the original unaltered metric to compare to, which you don't.  Locally everything would seem normal.  Figuring out the global consequences of a decaying timelike component in a realistic metric is a decidedly nontrivial task, and from what I gather, that's what Senovilla is making a claim about, apparently involving string theory, as well.<p>Re: time starting to exist, the idea there is that if we follow a timelike geodesic (i.e. a spacetime path that matter can travel on) far enough back, we'll find that at some point the sign of ""time"" switches, and stopwatch readings would return negative numbers and other such nonsense.  Time would ""start"" at the first point along that curve where a normal timelike component existed in the metric.  So the more accurate statement would be that time in the spacetime metric started to exist at some point earlier along the backwards continuation of the line that we currently think of as time (though it measured no such thing before that point), which is a far more sensible thing.",1248760969

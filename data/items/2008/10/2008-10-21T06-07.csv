338726,comment,338665,338725,0,0,qhoxie,,,"I agree in part, but I believe they did do some research for this.  <i>Most-desired</i> is subjective though.<p>It is kind of disappointing to see items like FB apps in that list, but I also believe it to the extent that a lot of companies recruit developers to build them.<p>I'll also note that I would add framework knowledge as something legitimate up there with flash.  While not every good developer uses a framework, it can be a good sign of agility.",1224572147

Objective-C is a far cry from traditional web dev languages.<p>FB/Myspace apps?  I didn't realize we started taking them seriously.<p>The only legitimate ""sought after"" skill on this list is Flash.

338721,comment,337828,338173,0,0,jwilliams,,,"This article alludes to this, but doesn't go into it - but the terms ""Technology"" and ""Business"" are totally bogus and I usually recommend that people don't use them.<p>I hear this all the time in big corporates - ""We need to ask the Business"", or ""That's for Technology to sort out"". It sets ""Technology"" apart from the rest of the organization in a way that just isn't realistic or productive.<p>When people invoke the term ""The Business"", what do they really mean? - is it marketing, or the call center, or the HR department, is it sales, is it the warehouse? It's a meaningless term. Technology is the Business just like every other part of an organization.<p>I've worked on projects where that mentality persists - and had successes and failures. I've also worked on projects where Tech/Business is never mentioned, it never comes up... These projects have been overwhelming successes (and more fun to boot).",1224571364
338720,comment,338417,338706,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"Bad marketting, honestly, though that applies mostly the kinds of circles HN types hang around in.<p>The BB SDK is far more powerful than the iPhone SDK, since you can do much more with it - background and startup apps, extensions to existing apps (like having your app's functionality show up in the email client's menu), listening to systems events etc. And it uses Java, so you only have to learn an extra API rather than a whole new language. Their IDE is kinda crappy, but you can use Eclipse or whatever you prefer, so it's ok.",1224571135

Driving up into the mountains with a few friends a month ago, we hooked an iPhone into the casette-deck and spent the whole drive thinking of awesome tracks to share, then streaming them directly from Youtube.  It was like having the whole of human musical creation right there with us.",1224570482

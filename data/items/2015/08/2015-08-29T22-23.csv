I can usually sit down and write up a half-dozen ideas in an hour.  They&#x27;re not worth being possessive about, simply because there are so many of them.<p>Having spent the better part of a year thinking up ideas and testing them in front of users, I&#x27;ll revise that opinion.  Ideas are cheap.  <i>Good</i> ideas are incredibly valuable.  It&#x27;s really easy to sit down and think up ideas that seem like they&#x27;d be both plausible and useful.  It&#x27;s much harder to find ideas that 1) can be implemented by a small team with virtually no resources 2) excite other people enough to overcome their &quot;activation energy&quot; and get them to try it out 3) would be useful enough in everyday life to keep them using it and 4) aren&#x27;t already being done by dozens of other people.  The filter isn&#x27;t &quot;1% of ideas that you dream up are actually good ones&quot;, it&#x27;s more like &quot;1% of ideas that you dream up <i>and think are actually good ones</i> actually are good ones.&quot;",1440889067

My experience is that functional tests, based on use case scenarios, give much better feedback.<p>Standard TDD-based design doesn&#x27;t really have a way to specify which is part of the &quot;public&quot; API vs. the testing API. Instead, it usually implies that everything is part of the public API, which locks in the architecture rather early. Are there common practices for distinguishing between the two?<p>> Feature documentation (for developers): Test descriptions enshrine in code every implemented feature requirement.<p>Unit tests rarely encode performance requirements. For example, you might have a feature requirement that the code process 10 M records in 2 minutes, or that a given implementation must have worst-case N log N performance. While it&#x27;s possible to use a unit test framework to write these sorts of functional tests, they are not unit tests.<p>> Manual QA is error prone. In my experience, it’s impossible for a developer to remember all features that need testing after making a change to refactor, add new features, or remove features.<p>Manual QA is a skill in it own right. This is why you have QA staff, who develop and implement a testing plan. Developers rarely have QA experience, so it&#x27;s not surprising that they would have more problems.<p>> Automated QA affords the opportunity to automatically prevent broken builds from being deployed to production<p>Agreed, but as James Coplien pointed out in &quot;Why Most Unit Testing is Waste&quot;:<p>> You’ll probably get better return on your investment by automating integration tests, bug regression tests, and system tests than by automating unit tests.",1440888330

It is open source and available for Windows,Linux,Mac and Android (at least, there are probably other ports).<p>Then you can concurrently learn a programming language (IMHO based on your post, Python might be a good place to start).<p>You might also take a look at CSound which is a dedicated environment and programming language for sound synthesis.  The CSound documentation pages also have references to a wide variety of other available systems (like Max and Reaktor).<p>If you are going to ultimately create audio apps for the iphone then I don&#x27;t think you can avoid C/C++/Objective C but you will have an easier time doing the sound synthesis experimentation in an environment tailored to that function.",1440887478

Some Orthodox Christian theologians have said that had the fall not occurred, Christ would still have taken on flesh for the sake of divinizing humanity (meaning to make them like God; see theosis[1]). What&#x27;s important to note, though, is that the created world of matter and all the living and nonliving things in it were initially good in and of themselves.<p>That being said, the initial &quot;job&quot; of Adam and Eve, and the way in which they demonstrated their goodness, was in loving and delighting in God, one another, and all of creation. However, the ramifications of Adam and Eve&#x27;s actions reverberated throughout the cosmos, and now we all share in the result.<p>The things described in the six qualities were created and given to us by God in order to help know God, one another, and creation. As such they are indeed good in their essence, but sometimes they are used in a disordered way that fragments creation, that separates us from God and our neighbor. We can use creativity to make music, or we can use it to hatch a plot to hurt someone else.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that Saul is attacking Judeo-Christianity.

I know PHP, Python, and a little Scheme. I&#x27;m not a very good programmer to be honest.<p>But recently I became interested in creating audio apps for iphone, particularly I&#x27;m interested in virtual instruments, synthesizers and such. I use dozens of audio apps on my iphone all the time, so I thought why not try creating one?<p>Well, I purchased couple of books on audio programming but they are very difficult right from the start. Core Audio is also very complex.  And they use C or C++ which are very foreign to me. As far as I understand this is a difficult field in general, so it requires low level programming, math and all these advanced topics.<p>I was wondering if it&#x27;s possible to learn all these things by myself? For the last month I&#x27;ve been studying some math at Khan academy, and I also got Kernighan and Ritchie book on C, but I feel like there&#x27;s very little progress and it gets harder and harder (currently learning about pointers and memory for the first time).<p>I&#x27;m really looking for some sort of roadmap, so if anyone could recommend more gentle approach to audio programming, or some books for very beginners, or provide some guidance in this field I&#x27;d really, really appreciate it.",1440885982

It also reports the differences between the top five contenders were statistically indistinguishable (but it doesn&#x27;t record which designs were in those 5) and that the designers were aware of the calculator layouts (which were actually a lot less consistent at that time that most people assume today), so if the calculator layout had been in the top 5 it&#x27;s likely they would have gone with it.<p>None of the calculator companies had the budgets or human factors research experience to do the kind of analysis that Bell Labs did (including some of the earliest true NUI UX research), so they just picked whatever design made the most sense to their engineers [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.americanscientist.org/libraries/documents/20057611634_306.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanscientist.org/libraries/documents/2005761...</a>

VMs were created for some need, and destroyed if that need was no longer felt. Therefore, no machine ever changed purpose: physical machines were only VM hosts, and virtual machines were destroyed rather than reused.<p>As a result, we were able to name machines after their functions without running into the traditional problems that stem from that. Sadly, this left us with a terrifically dull naming system: physical machines were kvm-001, kvm-002, etc, and VMs were fooapp-001, fooproxy-001, foodb-001, etc.",1440885768

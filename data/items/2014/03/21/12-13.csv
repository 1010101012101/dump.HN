The data we select, the models we use, create toy realities that we can use to justify certain policies and philosophies.<p>What makes Silver particularly pernicious -- and I count myself a fan of his approach to weighting election polls -- is that he pretends that data and modeling means 538&#x27;s articles are endowed with an Olympian objectivity. Yet his hires suggest that his articles are going to be animated more by ideology than rigor.<p>For example, he chose for his science writer Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist whose climate-change denialism (usually published as popular books, op-eds, and blog posts, not peer-reviewed papers) has been thoroughly debunked by practicing scientists. Not a promising beginning to his site; if I wanted to read worthless contrarianism written by unqualified hacks, I&#x27;d just renew my New Republic subscription.",1395406640

News has become too much a mixture of pack-like reporting of one exciting incident after another (often stories with little value beyond entertainment), and opinion. In order to form a judgement about something, you have to have experience of it, and data journalism is, or should be, about allowing people to understand the reality of what is actually occurring beyond their immediate bubble. i.e. at its best, it should be &#x27;empty&#x27;, and as close as possible to an observation. Once you have at least some factual basis, then you can start forming opinions, or forming judgements about the validity of other people&#x27;s opinions, and it is at that stage that opinion journalism ceases to be about providing superficially plausible rationalizations for your ideological preconceptions, and begins to be about finding some structure to make sense of the nature of the problems, and the nature of the possible solutions.",1395406116

Whether it be by accidental timing, cutting edge research, new synergy opportunities or actively spotting a hole that can be filled, the businesses start with an idea and they are not useless for sure.<p>Once you are up and operating a business however, if an idea is not about something you can trivially do as part of daily operations (continuous improvement has amazing value) but rather is something you need to divert significant resources or attention to in order to potentially realize some other values, then the value of the idea itself, on average, is low, because you will have a lot of these ideas, and you will not be able to dedicate your resources and attention to more than a few of them at a time.<p>It is far more valuable (on average) to be able to effectively choose WHICH of the already existing ideas have the best return than being able to add another idea to the pile.",1395405014

This may not be true when a particular tool becomes popular, say at the release of a new tool, but this definitely shows up as time progresses. Who knows what tools will keep up with the native frameworks terms of functionality?<p>Another reason that is more qualitative, is that you come into contact different design styles, code styles and paradigms. Objective-C, for instance, is a tricky beast sometimes, but it is an interesting language with a lot to learn both good and bad. The new things you learn will most definitely carry over into your web programming!<p>The third reason to code natively, and I cannot stress this enough, is third-party library support. Maven and cocoa pods may dependency management much better on the mobile platforms, and using a third-party tool will most likely render all those advancements useless.

Java and C# have been mature languages for statically-typed web development for years and are not difficult to achieve competence in. And for more fluid yet terse server-side languages you could always go with Ruby, or Smalltalk, or Racket, or F#, and their associated frameworks.

Later phases of the projects often gives you feedback on how well you have done in the beginning. If you participate only on beginning (design mostly), you will miss that feedback and you will not even know it.<p>What looks like great clever idea in the beginning sometimes turns out to be too difficult to maintain down the road. The new technology or approach that speeds you up so incredibly during first weeks can became huge drag withing few months. Smart clever hacks so cool first six weeks can make the system extremely fragile twelve months later.<p>Your projects rotating starter never involved in later phases of the projects may become problem on himself.<p>Second argument is about fairness. Finishers are not people who love to do all that less exciting work needed to actually \nfinish the thing. Neither are they too stupid to work on design phase.<p>Most often, they are people who feel responsibility towards project completion. If you do not allow them to work on those interesting parts too and force them to fix other peoples bugs all the time, they are likely to leave for another company.",1395403339

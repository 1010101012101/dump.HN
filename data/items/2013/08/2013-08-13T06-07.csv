Political patronage projects currently <i>are</i> in vogue, but their star is falling.

At some point the market for rational projects will reopen for a few decades, like it does from time to time.<p>Elon Musk is just the man to make it happen.

6204349,comment,6201586,6204195,17,0,magicalist,,,"No, it&#x27;s a very <i>visible</i> example of socializing the risk while privatizing the profits. It&#x27;s pretty small potatoes compared to the normal contract guarantees to even, say, companies doing highway maintenance, and let&#x27;s not get into the &quot;socialization&quot; of science funding. Where are our guaranteed ROIs on NSF grants?<p>The government makes these investments <i>all the time</i>. In fact, usually the (barely implicit) goal of government funding is to also encourage job and wealth growth. $12 million isn&#x27;t much of a return, but even revenue neutral is a win for the average government investment. And, like the tax breaks to encourage people to buy the very cars the government was helping pay to produce, the idea is to help kickstart an industry that might not have the differential to self-start, but has the potential to eventually be self sustaining and bring outsize benefits compared to the investment. Basically the same reason we fund basic science research as well.<p>And again, this is highly selective outrage. You can disagree with the whole category of government-sponsored industry, but you have a bit of an uphill battle there. Meanwhile, there are far more &quot;classic&quot; examples all around, not to mention the two other major car companies that together received nearly 16x what Tesla received and have so far not exactly put in a great showing for the industry-creating change that money was supposed to help fund.",1376376793

Getting it to 10.6 compatibility is going to take time and I can&#x27;t take the time off of work unless I haver the money I need to make it happen. Asking me to do this for anything less than what I projected is ludicrous beyond belief.<p>He&#x27;s saying that unless you recontextualize the project, you&#x27;re asking for too much.  Potential donors will have their expectations anchored by (a) their ideas about Kickstarter projects in general, (b) their ideas about similar Kickstarter projects, and (c) their understanding of the value you&#x27;ll be providing relative to their needs.<p>If your goal is high relative to similar Kickstarter projects you have to make it appear worth that premium.  If it&#x27;s unclear what value your project will add to your donors&#x27; lives that will make your job that much harder.<p>That&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying.<p>By the way, if you&#x27;re asking for donations to <i>pay for the time you&#x27;re working on it</i> and not the hard costs of the project then it&#x27;s absolutely critical you have a video with your face on it and not just text.

You are still subject to the tax rules, are technically breaking the law every time you entry the US with you real passport (as you must use the US one even if you never got it as you as still technically a citizen).<p>Getting rid of the citizenship is then best done around the age of eighteen, but chances are no one will tell you how much of a pain in the ass all of this is, and likely you won&#x27;t even be aware of the tax potential tax burden and paperwork. Alternative is to pretend like nothing and hope you never get caught.<p>When you finally get around to renouncing the whole thing becomes a never ending process of getting all the IRS papers and possibly back taxes in if you earn enough, getting a SSN as you can&#x27;t file taxes without it, actually renouncing, and likely getting the SSN after you renounced as the whole thing takes bloody ages, and then finally figuring out exit taxes and if you are actually exempt from paying them. The exit taxes of course have two loop wholes, one of which is you were born a dual citizen _and_ still pay taxes to the other country, which means you are screwed if you are working abroad. While the other test checks net-worth, average income over the last five years and a few other things. Oh, and for the exit tax the states assumes you have sold all you assets and will tax you on the capital gains of those fictive sales...<p>Whole system is a mess, there is no way in hell expats can fix it as their votes don&#x27;t in essence don&#x27;t count and it&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; money for the state. The level at which taxes kick in for expats of course stopped being adjusted long ago as the state realized that if they stop increasing the min. amount they get more money. Though it is still being moved slightly up, it&#x27;s long since stopped targeting the truly wealthy and is now hurting more and more regular people (especially if you live in a high cost country with high wages that has crept above the threshold).<p>Throwing money and/or time out the window is no fun, so I have no problem understanding why people want to get rid of their citizenship if they can without becoming stateless.",1376376079

Sorry - just look at the Cecilia Payne pamphlet that started this discussion. No victim painted there? And that is a very mild example. &quot;Rape culture&quot; does not paint women as victims?<p>As for privileges of women, granted, both genders face different issues in society. Most privileges of women center around having children - that is also the only place where you will find inequality in laws, and they are favoring women (there are in fact no laws that favor men in most western societies). If you don&#x27;t want to have children or can&#x27;t have children, as is presumably the case for transgender types, of course you face more issues.<p>If you don&#x27;t want children, it sucks a bit - life indeed isn&#x27;t fair in that regard.

6204282,comment,6200633,6202743,2,0,ser0,,,"Your comment about &quot;cheating&quot; is quite true. More specifically speaking, it&#x27;s an issue with assessment in terms of confirming that a student has sufficiently demonstrated the skills/knowledge taught by the course.<p>For a lot of programming courses, the idea is to teach programming skills considered to be representative of various levels of ability. This is usually assessed by presenting a specific problem that requires a particular solution (i.e. program a linked list or implement the observer model). In this way, the course is treated like a math course, which is not a realistic representation of general programming work.<p>However, what the articles describe is something I think is attempted a fair bit by software engineering courses. The issue is though, in order to make it &quot;fair&quot; on students, they are generally given a problem with a couple of obvious solutions that are not too complex. 
Within an Australian context, there are several reasons for this:<p>1. We only have 12 week semesters, so a project can be approximately 10 weeks long at most. Generally students have one or two weeks to drop/enrol so projects cannot start on week 1.<p>2. The idea is for a course to require 10 hours of commitment by a student, with 3 to 4 hours taken up by class time. This leaves about 6 hours of individual work time, so 60 hours in total. For a real full-time programming project, 60 hours is basically 1.5 weeks.<p>3. Students are expected to take on 4 courses to represent a normal 40 hour week. Generally, I don&#x27;t have too many friends that are expected to work on 4 projects simultaneously, it&#x27;s simply not a good way to manage mentally straining activities like programming. But within a university setting, we have to deal with this reality.<p>4. Students are not all the same. If a project is very open ended, it&#x27;s possible for students to select very simple projects for themselves and learn nothing. On the other hand, a student may attempt what appears to be a simple project, but have been tremendously challenging for them personally.<p>I have found this disparity occur frequently with some high schools producing students that have experience with a range of programming paradigms and design concepts, while others produce students with no background at all. Those with experience in high school have quite the advantage compared to others when you are talking about the limited level of knowledge expected of undergraduate students.<p>Another version of this can occur when students are given exemptions for prerequisite courses due to immigration or other graduation timing constraints. On the topic of international students, they can also come from very different cultural backgrounds and upbringings; for example, I have had students that had no idea what a stock market is.<p>5. Cheating and fairness. If multiple students take sample code from the same sources, it&#x27;s much harder for an instructor to argue plagiarism. On the other hand, if we force students to ensure they use different sources, there exists a fairness issue with some sources perhaps offering a better, more complete solution that requires fewer customisations to solve the assignment problem.<p>6. Monitoring, mentoring, admin, etc. A project needs to be able to be broken up into 2+ assessments so that an instructor can identify struggling students.<p>If a student is given a lot of flexibility and choose something like a component based software engineering approach, with most of the time spent on research, and basically implements the wrong solution, they may end up failing the course. Alternatively, they may leave everything to the last minute and turn in rubbish for open ended projects, which require a lot of planning and management.<p>An instructor generally has to explain why a student has failed if the student chooses to appeal his/her grade; this is where evidence concerning poor understanding and documentation demonstrating attempts to help clarify the assessment is important.<p>All of the above (and really there are many more subtle issues) mean that projects need to be simple, clearly outlined, and have clear expectations and deadlines. Given that, it&#x27;s much easier to avoid the whole cheating and fairness problems by constructing an assignment that do not require additional resources, or to force students to create everything from some standard set of libraries/tools.<p>I think wbillingsley&#x27;s 100+ person project idea is very good, however, that requires a lot of work on the course planner&#x27;s part. Within the universities that I have taught, the course planner also coordinates/admins, sets exams, and teaches the course. This leaves very little time for doing anything more than iterative changes to an existing course. It also appears to require relatively competent students, which is not always the case.",1376374810

It's not an obscure language/Fx that people haven't touched before.  They maybe haven't written Angry Bird with it (which BTW, their JS looks like it was machine generated -- anyone know how it was done?), but most know the technology decent enough to comment about it.",1307127563
2617573,comment,2616318,2616838,2,0,Chris_Dollar,,,"I think youre right, many dictatorial regimes are figuring out that shutting down or censoring the Internet forcefully is a losing battle over the long haul.  The Syrian regime may be successful in the short run by cracking some skulls, but if history has anything to say about it, they are using the wrong tactic. The medieval regimes of the middle ages could not reign in the Printing Press that decentralized information in Europe during the Enlightenment period.  Yes, the regimes in Europe were successful at first and many peasants lost their lives early on, but in the end, Pandoras box had been opened.  And once those books were out, there was no getting them back in.  Mubarak learned this the hard way when he shut down the Internet in Egypt, nothing pissed the Egyptians off more than that.<p>There are two viewpoints on how totalitarian regimes will wield power in the 21st century.  The first being the George Orwell 1984 camp, where Big Brother (the government) watches your every move, censors and blocks information  what many regimes in the Middle East are trying to do.<p>The second camp is Aldous Huxley's Brave New World scenario where governments team with corporations to offer a litany of distractions and entertainment.  Governments will not have to track us because well voluntarily allow our entertainment outlets to do that for us.  Well be offered all the entertainment and information we could ever want on cable and the Internet, as long as it is not too critical of the establishment.<p>The second dystopia seems to be where most regimes are heading, and with the massive consolidation of Internet Service Providers throughout the world, coupled with their merging with the largest entertainment providers in the world, the Internet as we know it will most likely look like Huxleys model rather than Orwells.<p>Check out this trailer on kickstarter.com for more info on this topic:<p><a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/akorn/killswitch-a-documentary-film"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/akorn/killswitch-a-docum...</a>",1307127551

Searching for Mersenne primes could work, for example.<p>That said, the need for proof-of-work comes only from Bitcoin's arbitrary design criterion of full decentralization. It's an academically interesting criterion but one that is almost certainly too expensive in practice for nearly all applications. Eliminate full decentralization and, even if you allow practically useful forms of decentralization, you get a much simpler, easier-to-defend, secure, and cheaper system. Even if Bitcoin plods along under its current speculative bubble, there's very little reason to think it will be able to compete successfully with other payment systems on transaction fees, because in the long term, those transaction fees will need to pay for all the proof of work.",1307127095

What I'm saying is that smart compilers are not in any way a substitute for branch prediction and processor caches, on the contrary: smart compilers are designed to take the best advantage of these features. And on the point why C and C++ are still relevant because of this: it's basically impossible to fully take advantage of e.g. processor caches in languages like Java and Ruby because you cannot fully influence how your data structures are laid out in memory. You can in C and C++. Sure, in theory smart compilers could do that for you, but in practice they don't.

This is the definition of amateur. Notably, you can spot things done in their software, Keynote being a glaring example. It has made a template of what a presentation is supposed to look like on a mac.<p>See when Jobs gives a keynote using Keynote wearing a black turtleneck, we recognize this signature. When your boss holds a meeting with a presentation in keynote with that same or similarly light faded colour background and bold white text, you recognize this as imitation.<p>Apple have fantastic engineers and fantastic designers and their products reflect a culture that prides craftsmanship, detail and perfection. But to say the web is amateur is to deny the wealth of originality and expression that spreads from it. Youtube has a direct cam to site, record and upload thing going because it enables people to be expressive. They keyword here is ""enable"" and it's in their advantage to promote the creating of original content by focusing on the enabling factors.<p>I think the article addresses the problem in a flawed perspective. Facebook being a good counter example. The problem with Apple is probably better tied with their culture. Apple is not social, and until they socialize they will not know what it takes to enable socializing.<p>A lot of people here are pointing out that MySpace was the amateur failure of the social web, further getting away from idea that social success == amateur, but let's not forget that MySpace was once, many years ago, ""the shit"" and only got its pedestal kicked out from under it when other sites offered better enabling factors (read: features) to socialize between friends. Sure, MySpace was fuck ugly, because not everyone's creativity is equal! but to say everyone switched to facebook solely because facebook looked more professional? I don't take that. (eh, i guess it was built better to - damn myspace always had fucking down time - whatever)",1307126109

The system is very complicated and verbose to use.<p>Lets say you want to write a program that extracts all links from a web page. How would you go about this? First, you look up in the documentation how to load a web page over http. This requires several lines of code, and it's complicated enough that you don't know it by heart after the first time you've done it. From there on it gets easier: you get a library and read the documentation to parse HTML and use an xpath or css selector to load all the links and then read of the href attribute. All of this probably requires around 15 lines of code, with various method calls that you have to look up.<p>In Ruby, I do this:<p><pre><code>    doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open('http://google.com'))
    urls = doc.css('a').map{|link| link[:href]}

It did not, however, have a data port, so all the programs had to be written on the calculator itself.<p>My friends all had TI-83 calculators, with data ports.  They had all kinds of cool games that they shared back and forth.<p>I thought one of the games, SNAKEGAME, was really cool, so I figured out how to copy it to my calculator.  I opened up the BASIC source code on my friend's TI-83, and manually copied the whole thing, character by character, into my TI-82.<p>Of course, along the way I made a few typos, and so when I first tried to run SNAKEGAME it blew up with a vague error.  I went back through the program, line by line, looking for differences between my version and the original.  When I finally got the game running, things were... odd.  I hunted down the remaining typos, and in doing so I discovered a few things.  I found out that I could just change a number in the source, and the snake would be longer.  Or faster.  Or he'd do crazy things.<p>This was basically my enlightenment.  I started changing one thing after another to see what it would do, and eventually I became fairly familiar with TI BASIC.  I looked at the source for other games, and eventually started making my own.  At first, they were ridiculously simple, but eventually I made a couple that were slightly entertaining.<p>After that, in high school a friend lent me a book about C++, and I struggled through it.  I wrote lots and lots of half-assed, totally crappy, unplayable games, and eventually started learning other languages and getting better.",1307125765

2617360,comment,2615647,2615647,1,0,flomincucci,,,"Just finished reading The Loser by Thomas Bernhard. Cruel, repetitive, ironic... effing brilliant. It's about three pianists - one of them it's Glenn Gould, and how meeting him ruined the life of the other two.
Currently reading High Fidelity by Nick Hornby. I can't be objetive about him, I simple love it. (The movie is great, also)",1307124408

Considering the number of giveaways of Apple products, driven by their rating as a very desirable prize, this seems to be a little ridiculous and unenforceable on its face.<p>I'm also wondering about the legal issues.

2617355,comment,2615621,2616035,4,0,bphogan,,,"Agree 100%, but also would like to add that the only reason we can't develop things faster, better, and more performant is that so many companies have been focused on making their own tools faster and more performant. If Microsoft can design something as cool as F#, they can make a responsive HTML + JS rendering engine. They just haven't put their money there.",1307124351

Rapid growth is not balance. Not having enough people to serve our customers is not balance. Not improving our products frequently enough is not balance.<p>Balance is a moving target. Sometimes we're in better balance than other times. But the goal there is to try to strike the right balance as often as possible.<p>I hope that helps shed a bit more light on what we need to do.

2617351,comment,2616412,2616412,12,0,ChuckFrank,,,"False valuation and poor accounting and financial transparency affects us all. We should do everything we can to discourage these type of shenanigans. A much better proposition would be to build companies that people want, and are willing to pay for, and then raise money based upon the future possibilities of those creations. Raising too much money is just as bad for us, and for Groupon, as raising too little money.  Why? because any mis-allocation of capital will lead to market instability, which will lead to inefficiencies. Companies, Societies, Empires, rise and fall based upon these simple tenets.",1307124339

Basically, spend more and faster than the other guy until he cries uncle.<p>Groupon is raising money, spending like crazy to be the top dog.  When the other ""coupon"" companies can't keep up, Groupon will buy them, retaining their #1 position.  Once all of the others are gone or reduced to a tiny size, they'll go back to a sustainable model.  This explains why they have a focus on hyper growth.<p>What do you think?",1307124241

2617343,comment,2616773,2616773,2,0,JeffL,,,"I've thought about this a lot, since I have a subscription based game with about 1200 active subs, yet nearly all newer games coming out seem to be in the item-mall / freemium category.<p>When I ask my players what they think, the most common response I get is that they prefer subscription model because it's more fair.  They hate games where the person who spends more money gets an advantage.  (Of course, my sample set is biased.)<p>The advantage of the item-mall category is that you get great price discrimination, and you also get a much larger player base than you would on subscription only.  But it's seen as cheesy and unfair, so works better with casual games, and I think that's the key.<p>If it's a casual game, go for item mall or freemium.  If it's a more serious or competitive game, then go for subscription.  I think we're seeing a lot of item mall games coming out these days because we're also seeing a lot more casual games.",1307124213

I heard the most recent hack mentioned on the local NPR broadcast of BBC radio, and all they said was that Sony was attacked again.  I'm not aware of any mainstream media saying why.<p>The only effect seems to be people portraying hackers negatively in general, and at best, questioning why Sony was so vulnerable.  The root motivation I described above seems to get no mention.",1307124199

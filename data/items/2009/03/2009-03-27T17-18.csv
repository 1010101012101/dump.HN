Yes, absolutely. The sentimental and communicative value it provides really is quite fervent, but I think we have a long way to go to evolve into a culture that will pay for something that, in the realm of social interaction (not including dating), is intangible, not physically interactive, doesn't provide us income, and can be had for free (emails/phone calls/picture exchanging), simply for the convenience it provides. Sure there are exceptions and maybe if Facebook charged from the beginning, the prospect of Facebook charging for its services might not seem so outrageous, but, for the average user, the contrast of how removed facebook's value is from our everyday physical life in contrast to how ""physically"" money exists in the real world I think explains this opposition rather well.",1238176369

Actually, I got tired of using my skills to do bad things.<p>I would rather live on the street than build a missile that is going to kill a child, yet I had a conversation just the other day with employees of Ratheon.

We are paying for the erradication of love.<p>Look, I know where you and many in this thread are coming from. I know why you are negging me. I understand it.

It makes their lives better.<p>But I am not talking about me.  I'm talking about an industry.  I'm talking about an industry that is working itself out of a job in exchange for a warm and fuzzy feeling.  I do not believe it is sustainable.<p>Technology is sustainable. Technology will continue to improve.  I will never go hungry, because the skills I have are in great demand and there are way more people looking for people who can do what I do than there are people who can do what I can do, so I am not worried about myself.<p>I am worried about society. I am worried that this is not sustainable.  I am worried that free labors of love are going to support labors of greed and crime and death and destruction.<p>And it worries me.  It feels like this hasn't really been thought through.  The high we get from giving away our labors of love is just that -- a high -- and I feel a crash is inevitable, perhaps we are in the thick of it now.",1238174895

People brag about how you can be in a basement of an office building (lots more concrete and steel than a refrigerator) and still get great reception.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Wireless#Radio_Frequency_Summary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Wireless#Radio_Frequenc...</a><p>If they were using a carrier in Hong Kong, most of the carriers use a higher spectrum, usually around the 1800-2100MHZ range. While it doesn&#x27;t give you great penetration in buildings like the lower frequencies Verizon use, I&#x27;m guessing the overall density of the towers is significant which would help this issue.<p>If he said they want into the basement of a building THEN put the phones in the refrigerator, it would be a little more believable.

5943217,comment,5935690,5937243,3,0,lambda,,,"Right, I am giving to separate reasons. The thing is, the second is a real benefit, but it&#x27;s hard to convince my boss of it, because he winds up being afraid that we&#x27;ll be releasing technology that our competitors could use.<p>The first is an unquestionable reason; it&#x27;s a lot easier to get him to agree if it&#x27;s a legal requirement. So even though the real reason why it benefits the company is the second, the first provides the leverage to tip the scales in favor of releasing the code. If the code were BSD licensed, we would likely never ship it upstream, because of his fear that our competitors will take advantage of it.<p>And there&#x27;s an additional, third factor in play: if you release it under the GPL, you don&#x27;t have to worry about your competitors making a proprietary fork of it, thus taking advantage of your work while keeping their own secret. So that further tips the scales. Sure, with GPL you may be required to release your modifications, but at least you know that by doing so, you won&#x27;t be giving your competitors a major advantage if they then build something proprietary on it.<p>And finally, in many cases with GPLed licenses, you can keep your own code proprietary. Just write a separate application, rather than linking it with the GPLed components. That&#x27;s how most of what my company does works; we sell a system based on Linux and many other GPLed components, but we tune it to the hardware we sell, and have our own proprietary management tools on top of it that make it integrate well into our market. This is why the LGPL or more permissive licenses are generally preferred for libraries (with very few exceptions, such as readline), which are designed to be reused regardless of the license of the application, while the GPL works so well for components like the kernel, system services, and so on.",1372204153

Naive recordings - such as what complete amateurs using smart phones will produce - will have all of that noise. So the recording of the event will not match our memory, partially because it will record things that were not important.<p>In order for the recording to match our memory, it would need to filter out all of the auditory and visual noise. But that&#x27;s just the start. There&#x27;s also the fact that amateur videos tend to not do a good job of showing what a viewer may want to pay attention to. As a participant, you can, without thinking, look around to see exactly what you want to see. This ease of knowing your surroundings will be a part of your memory, and the video will likely not capture it.<p>A <i>professionally</i> made video could alleviate most of these problems. That&#x27;s why editing movies is hard, and considered an art. Showing viewers the right shots for the right length of time to give them certain understandings of a scene is crucial to making the viewer feel like they are there.<p>My point: you&#x27;re assuming that the video recording is somehow an &quot;objective&quot; view of reality, and your memory is &quot;subjective.&quot; Your memory certainly is subjective, but I say the video is, too. Raw videos are not how we experience life, nor are they &quot;reality&quot;, so I think it&#x27;s uncharitable to conclude the author only wants fantasy recordings.",1372202668

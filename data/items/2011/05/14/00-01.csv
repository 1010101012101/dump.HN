Choosing a random slot and scanning forward to the next empty slot results in a bias where closely spaced entries have a much lower chance of selection than entries preceded by a wider gap.<p>It is easy to make that same mistake when trying to pick a random record number when record numbers have been assigned in chunks (like social security numbers).",1305333789

Its English-like syntax allowed managers and business analysts to describe what they wanted the computer to do without programmers' help.  Or such was the belief/hope circa 1960.<p>I think the desire to program without programming is somewhat misguided.  It's great to avoid churning out boilerplate code, and it's great not to need to remember lots of arcane interfaces, but programming, even in the most WYSIWYG DWIM system, still requires the ability to mentally model how the machine interprets its instructions and to write (click, draw, gesture, vocalize) instructions that solve the right problem.",1305332399

In theory an infinite number of files have the same hash, and the ciphertext could have been produced using a different key (or it could just be random data). In practice it's extremely unlikely (for sufficiently secure hash and encryption functions). What are the laws'/courts' views on cryptography?",1305331941

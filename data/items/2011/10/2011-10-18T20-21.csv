For example, Wilduck below suggests poor parenting as an underlying cause for both these effects.<p>Here's another example. It is well-known that there is a correlation between the global temperature and the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere (from looking at historical data). It is widely believed that higher CO2 levels lead to higher temperatures. On this basis governments have capped CO2 emissions, with real economic implications. This seems reasonable, doesn't it?<p>But some scientists who are working on this suggest an alternative explanation; here's the gist of it. There is a lot of CO2 trapped in ice, due to some historical reason that escapes me at the moment (it's not my field). As temperatures rise, ice melts and CO2 is released, leading to higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere. If this is the correct explanation, following your advice and putting caps on CO2 emissions certainly did not ""improve all our lives"".<p>""it almost always works out that further science shows the causation that you expect.""<p>Evidence?<p>""Taking your point literally, it would never be useful to do demographics like this because you can't ""prove"" the causation. But of course that's ridiculous; these studies are immensely useful and improve all our lives.""<p>Not at all. Sometimes correlation is enough. For example, if an insurance company finds a correlation between having red hair and being involved in more car accidents, they can use this information to their advantage.",1318970715

I also love that you can leave a task unassigned then drag & drop it when you decide to allocate it to a certain day. But it's a web app and it's not snappy enough.

I'm not a pitch-and-spin type guy, I once pitched YC with the alpha version of this very casino and gave up in the middle of the application. I do agree about the revenue model you're talking about working...I mean, I've seen that it works...but I have a hard time getting motivated for it, because personally I couldn't waste five minutes of my life playing a video game if there wasn't money at risk. Ditto sports. I just don't care if I don't have skin in the game, and I get bored fast. And it's hard for me to pitch to an audience that I consider to be basically throwing their time away.<p>This game's less configurable than the others... I like screwing with the underlying concepts of gambling. Previously I messed with 2D slots, letting players set their own symbols, weights on those symbols, and number of reels while keeping the max RTP constant but requiring some skill to calculate what you were getting. Did the same thing with Keno; fluid paytables. Then I started getting into more outlandish concepts like this: <a href=""http://youtu.be/gD4GqCAAsmo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/gD4GqCAAsmo</a> and a 17-line slot with an internal bonus multiplier that hadn't been tried before... <a href=""http://youtu.be/n4iwh7GNwNI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/n4iwh7GNwNI</a><p>All this got some attention from software companies who I didn't want to go to work for, asking me to shut down my site and come work for them on building a nicer Pai-Gow game or whatever. Didn't work for me.<p>The new one's a 3D ""slot"" with 36 lines, that's more than 50% skill-based but still has an RTP between 96-100%, no more. Perfect play yields 100% RTP...that was the idea. Also, while the normal payouts stay constant regardless of the skill level the player chooses, the progressive jackpot is more likely to pay out the higher the skill level, an extremely difficult inversion of the paytable since those skill levels are harder to win on normally.<p>Anyway, I figure Zynga probably ain't interested because it's not social, it's antisocial.

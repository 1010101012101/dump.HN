As a programmer, I was totally terrified that my typing was ruining my wrists and, despite my best workplace ergonomical efforts, it wasn't getting any better.<p>After a few months of sporadic symptoms, I noticed that the bad days were really bad in the mornings and got progressively better over the course of a workday. Huh, why would that be? I started paying more attention to how I slept (pillow positions, spine positions, restlessness, temperature, etc.) and noticed that I was curling my wrists pretty badly when I got cold at night or when life was more stressful. I'd literally wake up with both my fists curled into a ball.<p>So, really, I was spending many nights with my wrists curled for hours at a time. That can't be good! To fix this, I started spending a few minutes each night consciously laying my hands flat with my arms at my sides and getting comfortable with a better sleeping position. It took a few months to make this effort a habit, BTW.<p>Here I am a few years later and guess what? No more pins-and-needles feelings in my fingers. I haven't read any other literature covering this type of sleep-related injury, but I know it exists and I'm sure there are others who suffer needlessly.",1346878564

But when you invariably end up with people who aren't those perfect rockstar A-listers you think you need, don't throw them away. Stick to your culture and be emphatic about it.

That strategy risks over-fitting to successful fluke's, to people who made bad bets that happened to work out. There is enough loose money floating around today that some people out there are going to make bad bets and succeed.<p>I don't see why you/YC wouldn't focus on bets where you have an unfair advantage over the market and feel fine passing those up where you don't, even if they have some non-zero probability of success.",1346875370

It's occurred to me that the only way that Apple will retain me as an iPhone user is if they copy Samsung this time around.<p>iOS offers a great UX, as far as the system software is concerned, but I honestly think the iPhone 4/4s has the worst <i>physical</i> ergonomics of any phone I've owned.  Everything they could have done wrong, they did wrong... and I won't lie: the fact that nobody but me ever says anything like that makes me wonder what's wrong with my judgment.<p>If the new iPhone actually turns out to be a taller (?!) version of the same package and sales <i>don't</i> drop off a cliff as a result, I'm in for some serious cognitive dissonance.",1346875294

Also when Apple imported pf into Darwin; FreeBSD used that same port to update their port of pf from OpenBSD.<p>As others have mentioned, stuff like the TrustedBSD and Audit framework came from Darwin, and features such as Seatbelt and sandboxes are slowly being considered or improved upon by Capsicum for example.",1346875274

It would end up looking like <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> some-app.com/oauth-ok?access_token=abc123&username=jdoe<p>2. Provide an endpoint with the same data as /user/<name>.json, but without the uesrname in the URL. OAuth clients would query this new endpoint instead. While you're at it, might as well allow the client to request the goal list at the same time. Ideally, a client should only have to send a single request to populate its ""home page"".",1346875233

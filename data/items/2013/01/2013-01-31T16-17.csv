I had a really difficult time getting anything done in a house full of people, but I think it's just one of those things that varies between individuals.

I help teams become more Agile, and I'm a startup junkie, so all I care about is performance here. I want to know what works best in terms of product quality and pivot ability.<p>And guess what? So far it's co-located teams that kick ass over distributed teams. I wish it wasn't so, and I'd love to hang back in my home office and work, but that's not the way the numbers are looking.<p>To be more precise, yes, you can become a ""commodity"" programmer, that is, somebody that people slide a list under the door to and who delivers code on a regular basis. In this case you are competing with commodity programmers around the world who are willing to work for peanuts. If that's your thing, hop on over to one of the programming job sites and have fun with it.<p>Now I can already hear the objections. With all these tools, why can't I be just as plugged in as if I were in the office? Aren't you making a false dichotomy, asking us to either be on-site or completely on our own?<p>Yes, I am generalizing. Look, I don't know why the tools don't work to do the things they are supposed to do. Certainly we have chat, VOIP, and all kinds of awesome communication tools. You'd think that would be enough. But it's not. Instead of powerfully performing teams we get mediocrity.<p>I <i>suspect</i> that software development has a powerful social and human aspect that is not replaced by tools.

Going from least automated to most-
1) ssh into your server, pull from the repo and restart whatever processes need restarting that feed your app. Ideally you have symlinks or pointers to your git repo folders so you don't have any file copying to do
2) write a deploy script using fabric (<a href=""http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.3/tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.3/tutorial.html</a>) that does what you did manually in #1
3) use a tool like puppet, chef, or even salt (python-based)<p>Ultimately, you need to be doing #3, but it helps to go through #1 and #2 to get a sense for how awesome deployment management tools are.<p>A couple things to keep in mind:
- server authentication with git: you'll want to use public key-based methods to pull from git so you don't have to deal with entering passwords
- dev vs prod environment settings: you'll want to have a smooth way to transition config settings between your dev and prod environments so you aren't editing files everytime you deploy.<p>These are just a few tips-- the overall guiding principle is to automate everything.

It does associate ""shy"" with something negative. In contrast, if you use ""that movie is gay"", just by using that sentence on its own you are associating ""gay"", and hence a group of people, with ""bad"".<p>For why there is more backlash in one case than another you also have to keep in mind the direct effect. If you say ""We were just shy of our goal"", the potential to hurt a shy person who happens to listen in will likely not be large, but if you say ""that movie is gay"" and a gay person is listening in, it might very well hurt.

I've worked with some really hard core engineering teams during my many colocation years and remotely for the past 2.5 years.<p>Over the years of working with many great people, I had built a habit of potentially over-collaborating with my peers. It was hard not to, considering how much smarter two people are than one. And with the right mixture of personalities and solving hard problems, it's almost always more enjoyable (even delightful) to work things through together. You get the stronger sense that together you are delivering a greatness that would be hard to achieve on your own.<p>I've really missed that part since I've been remote for the past few years. However I have had to learn to be way more self sufficient and resourceful. I think initially the transition hurt my productivity somewhat, but it also ended up making me much stronger and decisive because I couldn't fallback to the whiteboard anymore.<p>I think I still prefer the colocation style to some degree because working closely with great people is just so rewarding. Thankfully even while I'm currently in my fortress of solitude, I still have great peers to work and connect with through Skype. We have a team chat going all the time that is similar to the war room arrangement where we can socialize and discuss random (sometimes even relevant) topics.<p>All in all, working with great people is the key either colocated or remote.<p>EDIT: I should also mention that your ability to focus on your own dev work is great for personal productivity, but often your full value to the team is only realized when you shift your focus to helping the team. I've had many situations where I could have used one of those ticket dispensers because the line at my desk was out of control.

The clinical depression can manifest itself again and again and will most likely never vanish completely.

5) The protection on the wall due to gear failure.<p>The above are listed in what I would consider descending probability, although 2 and 3 are pretty close, with 3 probably jumping 2 in trad climbing.  I would rate the probability of 5 being negligible barring manufacturing defects, the prevention and possibly detection of which is probably outside the expertise of virtually all climbers.<p>Moral of the story: safety is complicated.  (edited to add) I'd believe that trying to get people to apply a simple model of ""how many mistakes"" is better than none, but I wonder to what extent it reduces safety by making people complacent about having done a risk analysis when the system is too complicated to be analyzed that way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.redriverclimbing.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=13270"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redriverclimbing.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=132...</a>",1359650114

I think this is because we are measuring productivity in different ways.  Managers measure productivity over a week or month, which has stayed static, whereas devs measure productivity in amount of time they have to spend to get stuff done. When you don't have to spend 1-2 hours commuting, you spend less time ""at work"" and get the same amount done.<p>Personally, I like it, but we also already had a culture of doing a lot of talking via IM.

For one, absolute control over an application...bump versions any time you like, easy access to debugging information (crash reports, etc.), watch user usage in real time, on and on.

Small teams tend to do more than just work together, they integrate their socials lives. When that is the type of company you are trying to build, remote workers don't fit into that picture right away.<p>Also you cannot forget the difference between good distractions and bad distractions. Overhearing a conversation (between other developers), is less of a distraction than overhearing a couple of suits on sales calls or talking about the game last night. You can still be in the zone, have good distractions, be an introvert, noise cancelling headphones, etc.<p>A small team on-site is going to rapidly move through ideas, faster than chat rooms or even facetime/skype can truly allow, as natural as it appears it is nothing compared to in person conversations. That moment when your team discovers their Epiphany, in my opinion, is much more likely to happen in person.",1359649634

5145652,comment,5145303,5145303,2,0,temphn,,,"Research scientists will soon encounter similar pressures to entrepreneurs who negotiate the Medicare system. The scenario outlined in the article is similar to many of the prosecutions for ""Medicare fraud"".<p>Briefly, Medicare fraud is alleged whenever a business charges a lot to Medicare. This could be due to rapid growth or due to actual fraud, but it's immaterial. And often rapid growth happens due to exploitation of a previously unseen gray area (e.g. Facebook News Feed for Zynga) so regulators usually have an excuse to allege fraud. Unlike FB, they don't just block your API calls; the consequence of a new name appearing at the top of a ""biggest earner list"" is often a meteoric descent from a fast growing business into a federal prosecution.<p>NIH is much nicer than other HHS agencies, as its primary duty is to hand out money rather than enforce regulations. But what happened here is similar. Someone ran analytics to try and figure out which scientists were getting the most money from NIH, and to put some blocks on that in a time of scarce funds. In this case, the issue is that scientists naturally want to avoid duplication of work, and some projects require more funding than the limits of one grant. So they package up the same papers for different agencies with a different spin (bio-terrorism for DoD and bio-remediation for DoE). That's natural and good: leverage your existing work to get more money for the same amount of input. Put another way, this is like selling the same product (your research output) in multiple distribution channels.<p>However, problems arise with third party payment. I don't mind that you got a ""duplicate"" can of Coca Cola, or that the Coke company amortized labor across two different cans. But the government is ostensibly paying on behalf of the public for this work, and its incentives are more to keep scientists employed and to appear egalitarian than to maximize scientific productivity <i>per se</i>. It also wants to award less in grants while seeming ""fair"".<p>In any case, while nothing criminal/civil is being alleged now, I anticipate that grant agencies will make use of software that checks for duplicates in a way to reduce the outflow of money and make it harder for scientists to leverage the same work in multiple channels. The only silver lining here is that some scientists may start to explore non-governmental channels for funding, like patrons in the technology sector, or Kickstarters, or MOOCs, or other vehicles. Another response will be predator/prey like evasions by scientists, to set up grant collaboratives of K people in which the senior author is changed for each application. This will mean no individual scientist appears at the top of a list of ""biggest earners"", and is not targeted for duplication-based denials.",1359649108

Through Dandy people are able to submit their ideas to the site, the community then votes on the best ideas and provides feedback, explained co-founder Taylor Jones. If the community loves your idea, we develop the app for Blackberry, iPhone or Android devices. The money generated through sales is then shared with the person who submitted the original idea as well as anyone in the Dandy community who contributed along the way.<p>The Hyperdrive program provides companies like Dandy with the resources to succeed in the competitive tech start-up market. In addition to funding, Dandy will now call the Communitech Hub their home, with an office space and access to a pool of world-class mentors as well as in-kind services.<p>Dandy was co-founded by three young and uniquely experienced entrepreneurs: Taylor Jones of DearPhotograph.com, Karl-Allen Muncey and Matt Scobel. Dandy (dndy.co) is currently in a launching phase, but is accepting emails from new users for early invitation to the active private site.<p>There is nothing like this on the market.

I've found thats one of the reasons early stage folks don't hire more remote people. And there is some truth to being more creative with a team around you... <i>if</i> the team is awesome. Also communication is infinitely easier when you can walk over to someone and ask them a question rather than wait for them to respond to an email<p>2) Working remotely when you are self-directed and not under tons of pressure, really does lead to awful productivity. At home there are just so many ways to procrastinate<p>3) However, you can be <i>more</i> productive from home when on a tight deadline. No coworkers bugging you and the music cranked however loud you want, working whatever hours you want means laser-focus for some people.<p>4) A good checkin routine is key. I've been most productive and been in productive remote teams when there is a routine like a morning ""standup"" call, and maybe an afternoon call. A good ticket tracker is crucial. Working for folks who use the phone a lot tends to have the most productive outcome<p>5) There are a lot more small companies who use all remote workers than you think. But they hide in the shadows, and typically are very unsexy cashflow oriented businesses, not venture backed startups. If you're willing to work for consulting businesses that do boring backend for big corps you can find good remote work. But if sexy startups are your thing, expect to get a lot of hesitation until you really prove yourself...<p>6) Change environments.

When you become aware of a hazard, it takes conscious effort to avoid putting yourself in the way of that hazard.<p>To take the author's example of sleeping in the jungle under dead trees, when you first become aware of the hazard, you have to stop and look at your campsite before deciding whether or not to pitch a tent there.  Eventually it just becomes part of your background processing when checking a spot, and you would pass up an otherwise nice spot without stopping to think why.  If asked, it might take you a moment of looking the spot over before realizing that it's because of the dead tree sitting over it.<p>If you think about it, it's a lot like developing good practices in coding.  What at first is something you have to think about quickly becomes second nature.  For example: why do you (possibly hypothetically) use curly braces around a single line block following an if statement in a C-like language?<p>Several reasons if you think about it.  First, so that you can't forget to add them in when you need to add another line.  Second, because it makes it unambiguous which if or else if an else belongs to if you have a big nasty chain.  You don't spend a lot of time thinking and stressing about those reasons every day, but having the habit protects you anyway.",1359648481

In Rails for example, you can have ruby code in an ERB template which the framework compiles to HTML.  Hence, the HTML is ""dynamically"" generated (on every request).<p>The opposite of dynamic is ""static"" where the HTML is either written by hand or generated just once (like Jekyll) rather than on every request.  In either case, as a sibling comment mentions, an actual HTML file is served.  However, thanks to JavaScript development maturing and JS engines getting faster, a lot of functionality that used to be done mainly server-side can be relegated to the client.<p>I personally wouldn't use the phrase ""static client"" much, though.<p>(Edit: Problem with ""static client"".  To me a 'static' site means that it has no communication with a database, such as marketing sites or statically-generated blogs. 'Client' is too ambiguous as it's not necessarily a browser.  curl is an HTTP client, for instance, and a JavaScript-driven ""single-page application"" would be pretty limited via curl.)",1359648200

Suggest Pivottables: Select a range and ask excel to aqutomatically create a Pivot for you. 
-Suggest charts: Excel suggest what type of charts work best with selected data.
Data model - Although you need Pro Plus to use powerpivot and powerview, basic functionality that ""converts excel into a database"" is built in. You can combine data from multiple sources and create relationships between data.

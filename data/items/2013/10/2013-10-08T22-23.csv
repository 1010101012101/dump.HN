6518407,comment,6514107,6516230,5,0,gus_massa,,,"I agree. I hate the molasses explanation, because it suggests the wrong kind of equations. Higgs bosons dont dissipate energy. Repeat after me: <i>The Higgs mechanism is totally unrelated to viscosity or friction</i><p>I think that the added mass can be a better analogy (A ball moving inside water drags part of the water, so to accelerate the ball you must accelerate part of the surrounding water, so the apparent mass is greater then the mass of the sphere. This is unrelated to viscosity. More information: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Added_mass"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Added_mass</a>). But most people dont have a good intuition about this effect, and Im not sure that the analogies can be extrapolated to the correct equations.<p>The main problem is that Higgs bosons are extremely difficult to explain. I tried a few times to explain the Higgs bosons to normal people (like someone with only a Math mayor and no advanced Physics knowledge). I tried to explain it without equations, in a 10 minutes coffee talk. By the time I could explain the Higgs field vacuum expectation value and how it produces something that looks like a mass the people usually are totally bored and lost the thread of the explanation :(. I never could reach the part of the explanation about how the Higgs bosons appear in the Higgs field :( :(.",1381273157

Hash: SHA512<p>I strongly doubt that. What we&#x27;re seeing is all the existing investigations are hurriedly wrapping up and arresting the people they can before everyone cleans up and protect themselves. The NOD investigation began in early 2013 and had nothing to do with the SR bust, the 3 UK arrests seem similar (and the Plutopete arrest suggests that they hadn&#x27;t done their homework on him), the 2 Swedes went silent a week before the bust, and that&#x27;s everything I know of right now.<p>Since I hate cheap talk, I&#x27;ll even offer you a bet. Because of my interest in the topic, I track all publicly-known SR-related arrests, prosecutions, and convictions in <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road#safe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Silk%20Road#safe</a> . Based on the past history and the circumstances of the currently known arrests, I am strongly skeptical that there will be as many as... oh, let&#x27;s say 30 related arrests after 1 October 2013 and before 1 October 2014 (Should be more than enough time; this, incidentally, would imply <~1% of active sellers were arrested.)<p>I&#x27;ll offer generous odds: $100 to your $20.<p>So?

6518379,comment,6517913,6517913,12,0,exratione,,,"Delayed aging looks much harder to achieve than rejuvenation. A couple of billion dollars and ten years or so have gone into trying to just replicate the effects of calorie restriction, in which you have state A (short-lived) and state B (long-lived) of metabolism clearly laid out for you. So far a lot has been learned, but it&#x27;s clear that that is just a starting point.<p>People in the field expect it to take decades more to get to a point of safely adjusting human metabolism to slightly slow down aging.<p>Funnily it should be far easier to rejuvenate the old (very useful) than to slow their rate of aging (pretty useless). Aging is damage, and rejuvenation is just damage repair. See the SENS Research Foundation outline, for example. The research community already knows exactly how it could be done, since the root forms of damage that cause aging are well-enumerated, and it would only take a decade and a billion dollars to demonstrate that in mice. Full understanding isn&#x27;t needed, only the understanding of what to target and how to repair it: a fraction of the knowledge needed to slow aging.<p>Unfortunately this is a radical departure from running a drug development pipeline. The therapies look like infusions of bacterial enzymes, mitochondrial gene therapy, and more exotic things. So it remains a minority position in the research community simply because of inertia, I think - it&#x27;s so much easier to raise funds when you can point to every existing Big Pharma project and say &quot;it&#x27;ll be like that.&quot; This is how incremental, expensive projects that add little value continually suck up the majority of funding in any field.",1381272761

Forget about making a living off of magazine short-stories and articles!<p>You should get my point by now.  There are many noble professions that add to the knowledge and culture of humanity that must be done out of love, because the money is piss poor.  Most of these professions require tremendous investments in terms of time and money to get good at.  The music industry was an odd beast.  It never really invested money freely in artists, preferring to put them into debt so that they would have to be wildly successful before ever seeing a cent of return. It was sort of like supplying student-loans to grad students with the caveat that wages would be garnished until they leave academia. Without the record labels, musicians are largely in the same boat as actors, authors, etc..  Namely, they have to invest in themselves out of love for their art, or forget about it.<p>The notion that one has to suffer for art or science is not new. What bothers me is that we so blindly accept egregious rewards being handed out for the dubious virtue of &quot;being close to the money&quot;.  Bankers, traders, managers, etc..  People who are close to the money still make out like bandits despite the fact that their jobs are really about supporting the people who make and do.

6518279,comment,6516341,6516341,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"p-B11 fusion would be the holy grail for energy, since ordinary Hydrogen is very common, Boron-11 is the most common isotope, and Boron itself is fairly common on Earth (annual production is around a million tonnes). Moreover, the reactor design could be remarkably simple and highly efficient. Power could be directly converted from the plasma to electricity without a need to use heat exchangers or steam turbines. Additionally, the low neutron flux would make the reactor remarkably safe, as would the fusion products (primarily ordinary Helium).<p>However, as far away as D-T fusion energy is today p-B11 is even farther. p-B11 fusion requires plasma temperatures 10 times higher than D-T fusion, making it that much more difficult to build devices capable of inducing fusion. Worse yet, at those conditions the bremsstrahlung radiation loses using conventional plasma confinement technologies would be significantly higher than the power produced by the fusion reactions. What that means is that for every watt produced by fusion that might be converted to a fraction of a watt of useful power there would be more than a watt of power radiated away in x-rays and gamma rays, meaning that it would cool faster than it could be heated by fusion energy, rendering it useless as a power source.<p>In short, p-B11 fusion requires the development of novel approaches to plasma confinement and ramping up their capabilities up to and orders of magnitude beyond what we&#x27;ve done with tokomaks et al today. To say that this would be an enormously challenging scientific and technical enterprise would be a gross understatement.<p>Nevertheless, it very much does warrant continued research.

You can use #inject to apply an arbitrary operation to (operator, last result, current element) and arrive at a result.<p>For example, given a list of numbers, you can generate a bitwise OR mask easily:<p><pre><code>    [1,2,3,4,5].inject(:|)
</code></pre>
What this does is iterate over the list and apply ($last_result | $current_element) and return the result, which is passed on as $last_result to the next iteration. $last_result is 0 by default. This is equivalent to (as of PHP 5.4):<p><pre><code>    array_reduce([1,2,3,4,5], function($v, $e) { return $v | $e; }, 0);
</code></pre>
Or prior to PHP 5.3:<p><pre><code>    function or_mask($v, $e) { return $v | $e; }
    array_reduce(array(1,2,3,4,5), &quot;or_mask&quot;, 0);

Sorry. If you can&#x27;t implement linked list and think that first item is too much for an interview, HN is not the place to swing around. Keep downvoting lol.<p>TL; DR version:<p>It isn&#x27;t fair to throw a company out of a windows because they are serious about their hiring process. It totally depends on their company&#x27;s growth need! First bullet point is extremely fair but the rest aren&#x27;t and I agree on that.<p>Longer version:
A lot of hackathon projects become startups and many of them don&#x27;t require any algorithms. They can use libraries from Python and Ruby to do things they want to do. They can get away with a couple n^3 in their code and customers are okay as long as the service is stable.<p>And then there are startups out there building products using real algorithms that really require the knowledge of graph and sorting, dynamic programming and etc. If they need an engineer that can build on top of existing algorithms, then that&#x27;s what they need.<p>I was a former intern at Mozilla and my interview was very simple and I really appreciate that. But what I do doesn&#x27;t require me to know any sophisticated algorithm. I can survive with knowing Python and getting around with my brain. But interns on Firefox, servo and Rust probably had to face harder interviews, more tedious algorithmic types (although I heard most of those are basic too, like linked list and talk about C++).<p>I am also looking for new internship this winter and I fear these algorithmic interviews too, but some companies have serious need and they need people who can at least implement a linked list is important. I don&#x27;t bother to read what their needs are.<p>I did roll my eyes when I looked at &quot;3 hrs&quot;, &quot;4hrs&quot;. That&#x27;s a lot. But the first item: you don&#x27;t even know how to write a linked list using your favorite language? Then that&#x27;s the end. Linked list is not hard - you are not writing in C++ in this case.<p>The 7.5 hr is a different story, but I won&#x27;t trash at the first point.",1381270579

When I moved to California I was under the impression that it was a very environmentally focused state and that they surely would have as good of a system as Michigan but I was quite surprised when it turned out not to be true.<p>> almost every major grocery store has machines that process can returns - completely self service, at almost every grocery store. The grocery stores use it to get customers in the store<p>I was under the impression that any store that sold a returnable was actually required to accept them. Stores that didn&#x27;t have automated machines counted them manually and gave you a cash refund.<p>When I first moved from California from Michigan I dutifully saved my cans and eventually asked someone how to turn them in since I hadn&#x27;t seen any bottle returns in the store. When I found how you actually redeemed the deposit I was quite upset. Not only is it hard to find a recycling center but they are often not even open. It is a good example of the implementation of the same thing having vastly different outcomes in unexpected ways.<p>As a side note, Michigan is quite interesting in general when it comes to taking care of the environment. In many respects the people care a great deal about keeping the endless lakes and streams clean and keeping nature healthy. Unfortunately there are still a lot of remote areas where it is very difficult to do the best things.

Normally we allow users to override &quot;expired.&quot;<p>Was the OCSP server returned &quot;unknown&quot; for the old cert after it expired? One way to check this would be to uncheck the first check box in that dialog box (&quot;Use OCSP&quot;). If you are able to override the cert error for the expired cert then that is a good indication that the server is returning &quot;unknown&quot; for expired certs.<p>If &quot;unknown&quot; response for the expired cert is the cause, this is the law of unintended consequences at work. Previously, it was very common for a CA&#x27;s OCSP responder to return &quot;good&quot; for any certificate that it didn&#x27;t know about; i.e. their OCSP responders returned &quot;revoked&quot; for every certificate that they knew was revoked, but &quot;good&quot; by default. After the DigiNotar incident, we (Mozilla and other browser vendors) pushed CAs to change the default to be &quot;unknown.&quot;<p>However, it is also fair for the CA to &quot;forget&quot; about a certificate as soon as it has expired and/or to revoke it as soon as it has expired. If so, the OCSP responder would return &quot;revoked&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot; for any expired certificate. That would turn a user-overridable error (expired) into a non-user-overridable error (revoked/unknown). This is something we hadn&#x27;t considered.<p>Certificate authorities need to be careful that they update their OCSP responders ASAP, preferably BEFORE they give the customer the cert, to avoid this issue in the newly-issued certificate case. Because many CAs have just recently implemented this policy of returning &quot;unknown&quot; for unknown certs, there are still some bugs to sort out, I guess.

But I&#x27;ll bite anyways...</i><p>No, it&#x27;s not a troll, you called me an armchair musician when you know nothing about me, that is presumptuous. In your original post you concluded that anyone who disagrees with you &quot;doesn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on&quot;, also presumptuous.<p><i>Where did I ever say that you don&#x27;t need to practice alone?</i><p>To quote you verbatim: <i>&quot;Practice does not make you a good stage performer.&quot;</i><p>I think that statement pretty clearly asserts that practice does not contribute to performance quality. If you want to retract that statement, go ahead, but don&#x27;t pretend like you didn&#x27;t just say it.<p><i>Practicing in a room, without an audience, does NOT make you good at anything other than practicing in a room without an audience.</i><p>Another stellar quote, but ultimately a meaningless tautology intended to downplay the role of technical discipline in favor of experience on the stage. Once again, nobody cares about your stagecraft if you get up on stage to perform Little Brown Jug.<p><i>No matter how many hours I put in alone on my instrument, it still won&#x27;t prepare me for playing with other musicians.</i><p>Right... but playing with other musicians will. What is your point? You don&#x27;t need a record label to practice with your band.<p><i>No matter how many hours I put in practicing in a rehearsal room with other musicians, it still doesn&#x27;t prepare me for playing on a stage in front of audience.</i><p>I apologize if English is not your first language, but you need to research the definition of the word &quot;rehearsal&quot; before you argue that many hours of rehearsal with other musicians doesn&#x27;t prepare you for a live performance. Practicing in preparation for a live performance is the literal definition of rehearsal.<p><i>This entire discussion we&#x27;re having is completely irrelevant.</i><p>Your central argument is that piracy has made record labels scared to invest in risky music, and this is killing the music industry because the only way to become a good performer is to use an infusion of record label cash to tour till you become good enough to make a profit touring. I rejected this claim as bullshit because any intellectually honest person will admit that the most critical part of a concert is the actual <i>music</i> (you know, the primary product a musician is tasked with producing), something that has zero connection to VC money.",1381269663

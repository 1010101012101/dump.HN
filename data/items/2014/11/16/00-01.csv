8613124,comment,8611544,8612909,0,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>&quot;Most people are just looking for some simple thrills&quot;</i><p>This is patently untrue. Two of the top films in theaters right now are <i>Interstellar</i> and <i>Gone Girl</i>, neither of which can reasonably fit under the umbrella of &quot;simple thrills&quot;. In fact <i>Gone Girl</i> has been widely described as a very <i>difficult</i> film to watch in terms of its emotional impact on its audience - suffice it to say the appreciation of that film goes above and beyond mere entertainment, yet both are &quot;popular art&quot; in the sense that they are widely consumed by the mainstream.<p>The general public is capable of a substantial amount of artistic understanding, and there are more experts out there than you acknowledge. Appreciation of different types, genres, and subgenres of art change over time as a reflection of culture.<p>One good modern example of this is the comic book movie - comic books have unique thematic, structural, and aesthetic elements to them that were previously the exclusive territory of comic book nerds. In recent years this has gone spectacularly mainstream - and hundreds of millions of people now better understand stuff that used to be pretty inscrutable.<p>All art exist in a spectrum between the novice and the expert, mainstream society is quite expert at some (see: music, cinema) but not currently practiced in others (see: postmodernism). To boil the artistic sensibilities of the mainstream down to &quot;simple thrills&quot; is not only grossly cynical, it&#x27;s grossly incorrect.<p>&quot;Popular art&quot; is not mere entertainment - and it has never been, and has always been a reflection of the time and place in which it&#x27;s created. <i>Captain America</i> - popular right now - was a nationalistic symbol created during the midst of WW2 when it was felt that such a symbol be needed. The utopian portrayal of the future in the original <i>Star Trek</i> attracted viewers as an optimistic opposite to the Cold War. Heck, the conflict between the Federation and the Klingons is a direct analogy between the USA and the USSR (and naturally, the Federation always prevails).<p>And these art forms evolve - just this year we&#x27;ve had two massively profitable films between the X-Men and Captain America where the US government was portrayed as openly malevolent, and one of them directly addressed governmental spying. These works transparently reflect the times in which they were made. With the increasing media attention on drone strikes worldwide, even the <i>RoboCop</i> remake wasn&#x27;t spared - the movie went from a reflection of 1980s crime anxiety to a reflection of 2010s morality re: drone strikes.<p>This isn&#x27;t just movies either - Tupac built a huge mainstream career and long-standing legacy on works that plainly and openly commented on crime, race, and equality in the context of 1990s America. He&#x27;s far from the only one - the general public is <i>much</i> more capable of expert artistic appreciation than you give them credit.<p>People seek commentary, understanding, belonging, and even escape from the world and times in which they live, and popular art has provided this, and in this way they are not substitutable. The notion that people can or should subsist on past art exclusively is plainly false, as is the basis assumption that &quot;popular art&quot; is merely entertainment.",1416099247

8613116,comment,8611492,8613061,0,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"I&#x27;m guessing the paper was submitted to PLDI or POPL (wordpress is blocked here, so I can&#x27;t read the context), the tier one PL conferences. The communities are not adversarial so much as they are enamored with science. I think from that perspective, rejection is understandable: they want more numbers and comparisons, and might accept the paper even if these numbers are not very enlightening (call it going through the motions). You also don&#x27;t get many points just for wild experimentation.<p>For the same reason, many of the papers accepted seem very incremental and disappointing from a &quot;new idea&quot; perspective; and once you get the paper in, you have to go to the conference (I&#x27;m not a PLDI/POPL person)! One can always publish in a &quot;new idea&quot; PL conference (like my personal choice, Onward!, and there is even a new one called SNAPL from the people that brought us PLDI and POPL), but the points you get for publishing at those venues aren&#x27;t as much as the true technical conferences (I don&#x27;t care, since I have a job, but for a grad student, its a big deal).<p>My advice would be to suck it up and write a good PLDI paper. Be very thorough and honest with numbers and comparisons, and try to do it &quot;right&quot; (no pointless numbers that don&#x27;t contribute to the story even if they might &quot;work&quot;). Then with a little bit of luck in PC reviewer selection (most PLDI reviewers are reasonable, some are not), the paper would probably get in. And if they do it right, it could be a really good paper that are lacking these days. Actually, that is another point: sometimes rejection is good, because the paper that gets in later is much much better. Patience.",1416098740

8613107,comment,8612723,8612800,0,0,_delirium,,,"The claimed stat seems more ambiguous to me on which of those possibilities is the case. It&#x27;s specifically citations to old papers that are increasing. That is the <i>original</i> old papers, not just their results. Citing old results &quot;updated&quot; or &quot;collected&quot;, in e.g. a modern textbook or survey article is one thing, and could more plausibly be divorced from the history of science. But if people are really reading (vs. just blindly citing, which may be the case) old scientific papers, that seems more to me like the history of science, in at least a somewhat broader sense, is poking its way into modern science more significantly than it used to.<p>When you read the original papers, they come along with their whole historical era, all the way down to the quirks of language, notation, problem framing, epistemological assumptions, etc. You even, sometimes, need to know something about the history-of-science as a field to correctly read and interpret a paper from a different era, which you probably want to do if you are really citing it for significant content. (Admittedly, a lot of the citations are probably throwaway cites to old papers the authors haven&#x27;t themselves read, along the lines of &quot;This was first studied in 1927 [1]&quot;. In that case someone still needs to do some history-of-science work to read this 1927 paper and characterize it accurately as &quot;first&quot; to study some problem... but that work might be done by someone else.)",1416098375

8613090,comment,8612723,8612854,0,0,_delirium,,,"I wonder if the increase in the percentage of citation to older articles is related to the overall access situation getting better, though? Not that long ago, >10 yr old scientific articles were often quite difficult to access: shunted into &quot;old journal&quot; paper archives somewhere in a basement, from which they had to be specially requested. The library shelves typically only held 5-10 years of recent journal issues, and digitization efforts (at least in science) typically started with only the recent issues as well. To make matters worse, the old issues were rarely full-text indexed, so you might never even discover something relevant existed in the first place, much less try to access it. Nowadays an article from 1965 might randomly come up in a Google Scholar search, which was not the case in, say, 2002.<p>A more speculative hypothesis: this relates to the general &quot;flattening&quot; of the literature, as people relate to it more via search and less via subscriptions. People no longer really read journals as periodicals, or even use a specific journal&#x27;s index as a search aid, but rather search entire archives for things.

So, as move across the strings from\nG to D, A, and E, at each step are multiplying\nfrequency by 3/2 which, then, must be, and is,\na nicely good approximation to 2^(7/12) which\nis essentially what a piano is forced to do\nfor those notes.<p>A lot in violin playing is from listening to \n<i>harmonics</i>, that is, <i>overtones</i>, that is\n<i>Fourier</i> analysis.<p>Also that each string has a <i>natural frequency</i>\nof vibration is essentially a Fourier point.<p>But, wait, there&#x27;s more, and much earlier!\nNewton ran a beam of white light through\na prism which is a Fourier analysis --\nessentially\na power spectrum via Fourier transform.\nThen Newton was smart enough (uh, he was\na bright guy) to use a second prism and\nshow that the individual colors could not\nbe further decomposed.  So, somehow the first\nprism did some fundamental decomposition.<p>Also, some armies knew that soldiers walking\nacross a bridge should not march in step.\nWhy?  Because a Fourier analysis of the bridge\nmight show that frequency of the marching\nwas a <i>natural frequency</i> of the bridge and\ncould cause large amplitude motions of the\nbridge, failure of the bridge, and the army\nto fall into\nthe water below.<p>The main parts of the human ear do a Fourier\nanalysis.<p>X-ray diffraction is essentially 3D Fourier\nanalysis.",1416097250

Even if the intended goal is otherwise, in practice, peer review in CS turns into an adversarial exercise, with some differences in levels.<p>Rather than inspecting a submission and thinking if there is anything in the paper that might be of interest to the community, could the paper spur real progress, the review process usually boils down to: can I quickly skim to find something / anything with which I can shoot down this paper and get away with it and get done with this review. This of course is a generalization, not implying that this is what happened here. Unfortunately, the prototypical reviewer has become more like a prosecutor. There are various reasons why this has become the norm, people are aware of it, some are even trying hard to figure out ways to make it better, whereas some believe this is exactly how it should be.<p>If accuracy of prediction was a concern, Copernican model would never have been accepted. It took years of polish to make the then new model attain the accuracy of the then prevalent model.

I would rather have a reasonably well baked but not yet perfect model out in the ether soon so that the model can enlist / recruit other people to work on it.

A stack of slabs per &quot;arena&quot; suffices, and the extra cost is only a read from a cacheline you&#x27;ll soon need anyway. It looks like jemalloc uses a tree of &quot;runs&quot; for that.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly what you&#x27;re imagining, but I don&#x27;t see how you can pass this off to the kernel. You need a slab which has free memory. How do you know where to find it? You could write a nasty new syscall to ask the kernel for a ZFOD page(s), and then cry because your program is slow.<p>Also, unless your slabs are huge and your allocator is being used to fuel some kind of pre-caching, faulting pages is going to be suboptimal. You incur at least twice as many mode switches: one for the mmap call, one for each faulting page. I&#x27;ve measured this, and it gets pretty expensive. I&#x27;m kind of dubious about the performance of schemes which stray from the principle of &quot;allocate what you actually need; free it when you don&#x27;t.&quot;<p>The bottom line is that a slab allocator should be solving a different, mostly less general problem than the kernel. It needs finer granularity and it&#x27;s optimizing for common block sizes that are small enough to fit into slabs of known sizes. So it should optimize for allocating page chunks in a small subset of possible sizes (namely, the slab size(s)), while the kernel should be worried about unbounded, oddly-sized page chunks.<p>I toyed with scalable allocators for a course a few years back. It&#x27;s a little embarassing, but if you want to see what the costs actually are: \n<a href=""http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/apodolsk/418/finalreport.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/apodolsk/418/finalreport.html</a><p>You can do lockfree slab allocators pretty easily, so the game in scalable malloc is really about avoiding inter-CPU cacheline sharing and fitting your data structures into per-CPU caches.

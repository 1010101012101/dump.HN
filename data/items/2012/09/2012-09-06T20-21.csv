4486184,comment,4485347,4485347,8,0,Xcelerate,,,"Quantum teleportation is pretty cool.  But it's one of those things that a lot of people get confused about.<p>First, what is a quantum state?  A ""quantum state"" is all of the information you need to <i>completely</i> determine a system.  If you know a quantum state, then you know everything that there is to know about what it describes.  And if we take all of the particles that constitute your body to be ""the system"", then we can teleport it to a new location.  Of course, something as large as a person will probably never happen -- right now we're just doing one particle systems (although a wavefunction can describe as many particles as you want).<p>The news article says that ""matter isn't transported, just the state"".  This is kind of misleading.  There's a property in physics called indistinguishability.  Electrons are an example of something that has this property.  What this means is that you <i>cannot</i> tell two electrons apart.  They are identical in every way (coarsely put, electrons are just an excitation of the same ""electron field"").  This indistinguishablity leads to some awesome physics (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_statistic...</a>).<p>So it's meaningless to say that the original matter has or hasn't transported because there's no such thing as the ""original matter"".  If the state of the ""new matter"" is the same as the old once was, then for all intents and purposes you have actually teleported that object.<p>But if you have teleported the state, haven't you just cloned the object?  Aha!  Nature's too tricky to let you pull that off.  There's something called the no-cloning theorem which proves that it is impossible to duplicate a quantum state -- you can only move it around.<p>And to clarify one other misconception, quantum teleportation does NOT allow faster than light information transfer.  You still require a classical information channel to complete the teleportation (so it's not instantaneous teleportation in the sci-fi sense).",1346964888

Everyone knows that kindle is synonymous with books at this point.<p>You can certainly use other services like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify or Pandora. Amazon probably loves that those apps are available for their device. The basic reason is that once you go looking for something not available on those other services (which happens frequently) your only other real choice is buying it from Amazon.<p>I have a fire, and it was immediately obvious within a few minutes it's designed around consuming content from Amazon and spending more money with them. While it would be absolutely a mess to fully support two app ecosystems I think it's naive to think that Amazon would have supported any system that didn't primarily direct funds back to them.

One contributing factor could be that the US uses direct regional elections, instead of a parliamentary system.<p>In a parliamentary system, the people vote on a party, rather than a person, and the party decides the individuals who get elected. There's less of an emphasis on individual charisma, and charismatic leaders only need appear at the top of the ticket. A party with sufficient representation is free to fill out the bottom of its ticket with ""specialists"" whose expertise is valuable, but who wouldn't win a general election on their own.<p>Meanwhile in the states, every ticket is one member deep so there are no specialists, only generalists. While they can be advisors, the only official positions they can take are cabinet members (where we do see lots of scientific degrees). Further, the lack of scientists in low-ranking elected positions (like House of Representatives) means that there's less of a science+politics talent pool to draw from for the high-ranked positions (Executive branch).",1346964532

</code></pre>
What this does is use 'find' to find the file and directory names (with your supplied CRITERIA), send them over to xargs with no funny filename parsing, run those filenames as arguments to COMMAND, batched up to BATCH_SIZE at a time (I usually use 100-500), and ignoring empty batches.<p>Usually COMMAND would have '--' at the end to prevent filenames from being parsed as arguments, but not all commands need that treatment. If COMMAND doesn't take the filename list as the last argument(s), it can be fixed with the '-i' option to xargs.<p>The BATCH_SIZE part here is important in many cases. Since large numbers of filenames will break the command line arguments size limit to COMMAND, a reasonable BATCH_SIZE will prevent thousands or millions of filenames from breaking your script. Also, sometimes you may want to run the files through COMMAND one at a time (BATCH_SIZE of 1).<p>Finally, the '-r' option, which I don't see mentioned often enough, tells xargs not to be derpy and run COMMAND with an empty argument list. Seriously, '-r' is short for '--no-run-if-empty'.<p>For anything else, a nice scripting language is the only way to fly.",1346962911

4485935,comment,4485767,4485767,42,0,tokenadult,,,"From the opinion piece kindly submitted here, which is by mathematician and popular author on mathematics John Allen Paulos:<p>""Ive visited Singapore a few times in recent years and been impressed with its wealth and modernity. I was also quite aware of its world-leading programs in mathematics education and naturally noted that one of the candidates for president was Tony Tan, who has a Ph.D. in applied mathematics. Tan won the very close election and joined the government of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who also has a degree in mathematics.""<p>Indeed, it is hard to remember anymore that Singapore was a very, very poor country when it achieved independence (after being expelled from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965). Singapore was settled earliest by ethnic groups similar to those in current Malaysia, with a big influx of wretchedly poor agricultural laborers for plantation labor during the British colonial period. It was not expected in the pre-independence period (which extended into my lifetime) that Singapore would ever be prosperous. (You can watch a videotape of the movie Saint Jack, which was filmed in Singapore, for a reminder of the poverty in Singapore as recently as in the early 1970s.)<p>But the early leadership of independent Singapore strongly emphasized effective generally available primary education (without at first even making school attendance compulsory) and studied the best international examples of sound textbooks and effective teaching practice.<p><a href=""http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf</a><p>People from Singapore are so ethnically diverse that Singapore has four official languages from four different language families. School pupils in my generation (born in the late 1950s) grew up in a country that was extremely poor (it's hard to remember that about Singapore, but until the 1970s Singapore was definitely part of the Third World) and were educated in a foreign language (the language of schooling in Singapore has long been English, but the home languages of most Singaporeans are south Chinese languages like my wife's native Hokkien or Austronesian languages like Malay or Indian languages like Tamil) and yet received very thorough instruction in mathematics.<p>Today Singapore is prosperous, and one set of projections suggests it is on track to be the richest country in the world on a per-capita basis by 2050.<p><a href=""http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/15/singapore-worlds-richest-country-by-2050/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/15/singapore...</a><p>Chapter 1: ""International Student Achievement in Mathematics"" from the TIMSS 2007 study of mathematics achievement in many different countries includes, in Exhibit 1.1 (pages 34 and 35)<p><a href=""http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf</a><p>a chart of mathematics achievement levels in various countries. Although the United States is above the international average score among the countries surveyed, as we would expect from the level of economic development in the United States, the United States is well below the top country listed, which is Singapore. An average United States student is at the bottom quartile level for Singapore, or from another point of view, a top quartile student in the United States is only at the level of an average student in Singapore. I've been curious about mathematics education in Singapore ever since I heard of these results from an earlier TIMSS sample in the 1990s.<p>So regardless of whom we elect in the United States, why can't we be curious about what we can learn from other countries that have handled diverse language backgrounds of elementary pupils better than the United States has, and have enjoyed sustained, rapid economic growth for longer than the United States has?<p>ESPECIALLY NOTE THIS PART OF THE POST ABOUT MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION AND DEMOCRACY<p>Just yesterday, I learned from another Hacker News participant, one who grew up in one country and now lives and works in another, about the latest revision of the article ""Word Problems in Russia and America""<p><a href=""http://www.de.ufpe.br/~toom/travel/sweden05/WP-SWEDEN-NEW.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.de.ufpe.br/~toom/travel/sweden05/WP-SWEDEN-NEW.pd...</a><p>by Andrei Toom, a Russian mathematician who has lived in the United States and now teaches in Brazil. The document is long (98 pages) but well worth reading. Toom's conclusion is very striking.<p>""34. Conclusion<p>""Having read this article, somebody may think that I connect poor education with democracy. I do not. History connects them sometimes, at random as it seems. What I do think is that democracy has many aspects and free elections of political leaders is just one of them. Quality of education is not determined by quality of political structure and can deviate from it for better or worse. Let me illustrate this idea by two examples. There are 2354 problems in [Berez], a few dozens of which contain Soviet political propaganda.<p>""This is an example:<p>""Problem 59 How many years passed from the French burgeois revolution till the Great October socialist revolution if the former took place in 1789? (p. 17). [P: revolution]<p>""Here the political bias is evident, but from the mathematical point of view the problem is fair: the correct answer is arguably 1917  1789 = 128 . Soviet leaders wanted such problems to indoctrinate Soviet ideology along with teaching mathematics, but only half of their wishes came true: students learned mathematics, but got rid of the Soviet rule. Some rushed to the West taking jobs from those who were raised on problems like this:<p>""Problem 60 A national magazine surveyed teenagers to determine the number of hours of TV they watched each day. How many hours do you think the magazine reported? [St.1], p. 79. [P: TV]<p>""It may seem very human to use this problem in class: every student will be able to say something and nobody will be completely wrong, so nobody will be frustrated. But when these kids grow up, they will regret the years wasted on such shallow 'problems'.""<p>To sum up, there isn't any necessary relationship between numeracy (which many, many people in Taiwan have because of very effective primary mathematics education there) and democracy and freedom (which the people of Taiwan won largely through peaceful protest movements even though their own former dictatorial government told them that they were culturally unsuited for free elections and a free press). I have followed the economic development and political liberalization of Taiwan closely since the 1970s, having lived there for six years of my life, and it is definitely empirically possible to have politicians who have strong math skills and win elections and to have genuinely free elections and deep protection of civil liberties. Why not the best? Why not seek all of the best features we can learn about from other countries for the country we live in?<p>AFTER THE LAST EDIT I STILL HAVE AVAILABLE:<p>Yes, I am speaking about both Singapore (the country mentioned in the submitted article that opened the thread) and Taiwan. Singapore is a good example of mathematics education, but a (relatively) bad example of democracy. Taiwan is a good example of mathematics education, another example of a poor country becoming prosperous by educating the masses, and also an ever improving example of democracy in a cultural context with a long history of tyranny. To sum up, improving mathematics education in the United States is a good idea, and several countries can provide good examples to the United States of how to do that. To the point of the submitted article, it would be good for voting behavior and legislation in the United States if the broader masses of the citizenry had better numeracy.<p>One other top-level comment made a very important point, the point I was thinking of making when I first read the title of the submitted article before reading its content.<p><i>""The largest punishment for those who are not interested in politics, is that they'll be governed by those who are.""<p>Maybe the best solution would be to teach politics to scientists, and not the other way around?</i><p>One of my motivations for participating on Hacker News, where most participants are trained in technical subjects, rather than the foreign language (Chinese) undergraduate degree and law degree that I have, is that I think it is important for technically trained people to understand democratic politics and the representative legislative process better than most do. I try to do my part as a mathematics educator (my current occupation) to show Americans an alternative model of mathematics instruction, and I am gratified to have clients of all ethnicities from multiple countries who know that it is possible to do better in mathematics education than is done in America's public school system. I try to do my part here on HN to remind all our friends that politics is the art of compromise, and policy trade-offs have to be carefully considered and presented to stakeholders with persuasion rather than only with statements about what is correct. I enjoy the intellectual exchange here precisely because my years of living abroad and studying public policy sometimes give me something different from the consensus view to say here, and I correspondingly learn from people here who have a perspective besides that which I have gained from formal education and work experience. Let the scientists enter politics if they will, but let them do so with their eyes open.",1346961841

It doesn't answer the question, but it does go looking for a more full understanding of...well, why.<p>The guy who made it, when he announced it to the conference and when they screened it, seemed to take it very seriously. I felt it took pains to explore the work and to not invade the privacy of the withdrawn man. As I watched it, I thought it was targeted at people like me who are newcomers. They wanted me to know about this guy who passed through and what he meant to them. It felt oddly like a family gathering talking about a recently passed grandmother.<p>I got no vibe that this was a major network style drive by or that he was trying to ride the coat tails of a guy who has expressed his desire to be left alone. There was a respect under the whole thing and a labor of love - of the work and the community.<p>When it was done, I felt like ""this is a good place, to be around people who make this and do this"". It was a sad send off of a good friend.<p>I've never met _why. I have learned a lot from him. I think that's the point.",1346961764

The thing about Why is that he was <i>insanely helpful</i> and produced a lot of cool stuff. His focus at the time was a project intended to help kids learn to program. So when Why suddenly tore everything down and disappeared, it seemed really incongruous with the way he'd acted up to that point, and people were left wondering  why? It's not that he turned down fame (honestly, he always rejected fame, so big surprise there), but that this incredibly nice and helpful guy acted so violently toward the projects he'd created to make the world a better place. People want to know why, and so they want to know Why.",1346961657

I doubled my salary moving from Toronto to the Bay area.<p>2) Silicon Valley (and NY) has smart money. Not to insult Canadian VCs, but the ones I've met are glorified bankers.<p>3) This is no longer true. The recent govt is increasingly unfriendly to immigrants.<p>4) In the bay area, everyone I knew (and their dog) was working on a startup. Toronto and Vancouver don't compare.<p>5) I am very jaded by the govt influence on R&D. This attracts the wrong sort of people. e.g. I've heard of consulting firms that will write your proposal and greatly increase your odds of success - all you have to do is give them a 25% cut. Frankly, the cost of creating a startup is low enough that if you believe in your idea/revenue generation potential, you should not waste time writing proposals.",1346961613

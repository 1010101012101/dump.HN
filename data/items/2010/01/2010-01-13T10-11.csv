1049884,comment,1048202,1048202,0,0,nadam,,,"I think you need both talent and persistence to be successful. And I agree that talent is generally overrated (but needed).<p>If you have some talent and also some persistence in things which you like, than you may still have some problems: you need some time management strategy. This is by far the key issue for me: What am I really interested in? Shall I dig deeper in that subject? Or shall I go and learn new things in which I am a beginner and not THAT interested? Shall I do things which I am really interested in, or shall I work in a day job for more money, to make enough money to take care of my family? Shall I practice creating algorithms, which I am pretty good at right now but not the best, or shall I learn more about marketing, in which I am a beginner? Shall I choose a hobby project in a theoretical territory like creating an interesting programming language, or shall I execute my other idea which is not THAT interesting intellectually, but still interesting enough, and can earn me money if successful?<p>So I think the key is not only persistence, but to choose what to do, to find your style, to find out what is the thing you are really talented/interested in, what you want to excel at. Hacking is still a very broad territory in itself. You cannot be the best in every aspect of it even if you practice for years or decades. To reach a very high level the key is to choose what to learn and practice very cleverly (or luckily).",1263378793

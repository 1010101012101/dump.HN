653497,comment,652885,652885,0,0,qeorge,,,"I like the idea, but the design has a couple of flaws:<p>- The heading text is hard to read (perhaps choose a different font?)<p>- The button's rollover states aren't preloaded, makes it a bit awkward. Preload them, or better use CSS sprites<p>- The PNG buttons aren't blending properly with the content's background image<p>- The tour's screenshot thumbnails should be small images, not large images resized with HTML. End result is that each one is ~200K. Easy to fix and would make the page load a lot quicker<p>Its a really nice idea though - I think people would love to get a collection of letters from friends on their birthday, anniversary, etc. Keep going!",1244750339

I thought you might not have meant that, but forgot about it when I began writing. Sorry. Please don't complain because I misinterpreted you when you wrote something unclear, though.<p>In terms of experiments, I dunno, man. You're pretty much going to have to let that one go - you can never have experiments with animals over a certain size. If you can manage reading about bacterial experiments, though, that's been done - here (<a href=""http://www.rasmusen.org/x/2006/11/24/evolution-experiments-with-bacteria/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rasmusen.org/x/2006/11/24/evolution-experiments-w...</a>) may be a good place to start. Bacteria don't modify limbs, but they can evolve new metabolic mechanisms in experiment time, which I think is comparable. For larger animals, see the fossil record. There really are some incredible examples - I'll show you if you're interested.<p>I still don't see what mechanism you're claiming inhibits parts of the genome from mutation. You accept that mutation occurs and think there are parts where it can't, correct? Though this would make sense if you were assuming a Creator wanted only microevolution to happen, but you can't just assume the things you're trying to prove. With no assumptions, there is no reason for these prohibitions on mutations to exist (other than on crucial DNA where protections have evolved because the functions are so important to life - cell duplication, for example). There are differences all over human DNA, not just in one special spot. What, other than the religious aspect, is convincing you that mutation spares parts of the genome?",1244747426

Machines on the 'Net were expected to be somewhat sophisticated service and intelligence-wise (since they were owned and operated by universities, military establishments, etc.)  IP addresses originally had identifying characteristics that could be tracked to an employer, if not an individual or department.  Even when ""anonymous"" PCs and Macs were originally being hooked up the Internet (first directly, then later via NAT) the initial connection tools still provided support for identification via finger, message signatures and so on to continue this tradition.  (Anarchie, one of the first Mac FTP clients, also doubled as a Unix-like identification stack when configured fully.  Many PC video game developers, like John Carmack, continued to use .plan files prior to rise of the modern ""blog."")<p>But then the Endless September came, and most end users by this point weren't versed in ""netiquette"" or the whole RFC tradition to know how to use such tools and protocols, so anonymity crept in as an accidental default state.  (As the drift towards the modern connotation of ""peer-to-peer"" demonstrates.)

3375558,comment,3361181,3362485,1,0,mikegreenberg,,,"Apologies for the slow reply. I had an unexpectedly busy weekend.<p>Much as has been said, information overload is a real problem we subject ourselves to. The way I help cull this wicked overflow is by using ""systems""... or any method or tool which helps regulate flow. It's important to realize the fixed set of resources we each have available to us. The king of these is time. Managing it is topic I'll leave to experts. But we consciously decide to use a portion of our available time to improve ourselves in various capacities. And the trick is to use systems to maximize the efficiency of our learning during the time we dedicate.<p>Some examples:\nWe browse an ungodly amount on the web. Usually without purpose. I use an RSS reader to improve my efficiency. Not only does it let me control the inputs by subscribing only to the content I'm interested in, but it lets me eliminate most of the distractions that being on their website would introduce (ads, links to other parts of their site, comments, etc). And as a bonus, my RSS reader tracks my usage...so now I know which sites I really read so I can regularly trim the fat and optimize my reading schedule around the parts of the week when the interesting content gets published.<p>Another example:\nEmail is burden for everyone. Having a good email client that you know REALLY well and fits into your routine will help tremendously. My email client provides me an incredible backlog of my activity on the internet which I keep for reference. I use filters to automatically sort this information for me. Important contacts, social activity, purchases, subscriptions, marketing, spam...all divided up automatically with the relevant portions being pushed to my phone as needed. (Yep, my phone doesn't notify me of just any email...just ones on my ""VIP"" list. Now I can help emergencies as needed and deal with my regular email zeroing once or twice a day.)<p>Books are something I don't particularly deal with because of the long commitment required to get through them. I'll try to find an abridged version of an audiobook if it's HIGHLY recommended. I can't think of any particularly good suggestions on how to get through them quickly aside from scanning them in the bookstore and deciding if you want to invest a week of your time getting through one or not.<p>Regarding your ""clarity about goals"", I don't think anyone is ever 100% certain about the direction they should be going in until they have enough experience to know that's the right way to go. You're young and being worried about the ""right way"" is pretty natural. And I've found that the time you spend ""idling"" and figuring out the best possible route could cause you to miss some interesting opportunities. Don't spend too much time on the decision.<p>You're looking at the problem from the perspective of ""these are my skills, how can I use them?"" Instead, you should be asking ""Of the opportunities I have in front of me, which would I most regret not doing?"" It's how I try to frame my decision making and sometimes it helps make a difficult decision an easier one to live with in the long run. Worst case scenario, most of the time you'll be able to double-back and find a way to go down the ""other path"" if you're disappointed with results.<p>Hope this helps. :)",1324421551

These can be pretty simple, a concrete slab, then 'tilt up' walls tied together by steel joists. Internal structure is 'UPS area' / 'power ingress/conditioning' / 'data area' / 'office area' / 'fire systems area'. If its mostly data operations the bulk will be the 'data area'. The cost of land figures into it as well but you probably try to build it where land is cheap, connectivity is high, and power is cheap.<p>2) Power and Cooling infrastructure. This stuff is dictated by both the climate around the data center and the municipality. Santa Clara California used to have a bunch of semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) which have all since closed. That left them with excess power capacity, so lots of folks are building data centers there to get access to the cheaper power. (land is still expensive). Cooling can be one of a number of forms, evaporative works well in the Bay Area generally.<p>3) Staff - Generally an electrician, a network guy, a security lead (+ some number of contract security personnel)<p>4) General 'stuff' associated with building a data center (raised floor tiles, sprinkler systems, power conditioners, big switches, UPSes and their batteries, chillers, more big power switches and transformers, generators (back up power), lights, etc.<p>I would be surprised if it cost less than $5M to build or more than $15M.<p>I actually put together a plan for a 'pocket' data center (one that could be put into an urban area easily, 1 - 3MW of power) but not surprisingly cannot find a bank to fund it.

The standard says size_t is an unsigned integer type, but doesn't say way size.  However, the C89 spec explicitly stated that there are no integers sizes longer than long- so the conforming way to do this is to explicitly cast the size_t to unsigned long (which, while it may add bits, is guaranteed not to lose them), and print the unsigned long.<p>In an attempt to save all the broken, non-conforming code that assumed that sizeof(int) == sizeof(long), C99 introduced the long long type.  And, among other things, allowed size_t to now be unsigned long long.  Which meant the conforming C89 code that wants to print out a size_t is now wrong.  Worse yet, it's silently broken- because the type cast is explicit, the compiler has to assume it's correct.  They added a new way to print size_t's, granted- but this is no help for the legacy code (or code that needs to continue to support C89-only compilers).<p>Of course, the punchline here is that I have yet to see code that assumed sizeof(int) == sizeof(long) that didn't also assume sizeof(void *) == sizeof(int).

The problem with giving to beggar is not that it reinforces the behavior it is that it generally so insignificant that it does little to help them pull out of their situation. Let's face it $10, $20 even $300 bucks is not going to help change that persons life. They are so stuck in a pattern of habitual poverty that it takes more than money to help them correct their course. They have to unlearn being poor, because poor is not a marketable skill. Some are even too far gone for that, either through mental deficiencies, or habitual behavior some may never be able to be rehabilitated.<p>But one thing is certain, not given them a couple of bucks, is not doing them any favors.

So your experiment is ideally possible, but I think that it will be very difficult to implement.<p>(In the original experiment, after a few moments, the magnet falls at an almost constant speed.

Whenever I need it, I do: Ctrl+Space, ~/Desktop/[IP] to select the file, '.' to treat the filename as text, tab to go to the action part of QuickSilver, start typing ""clipboard"" and when ""Copy to clipboard"" shows up, I press enter. It can sound like a lot of steps but it gives me the IP address in my clipboard without reaching for the mouse, without having to open a file or an app.<p>I also use it for the integration with the address book. I type the name of the contact, select a phone number, tab to the action part and type ""skype"" to start calling with Skype. Or I would copy it to the clipboard to put in Google Maps…<p>If you've never used QuickSilver, that might sound too complicated for not much benefits, but it's something you learn over time.

C++'s tuple class lets you do some of the cool listy type things you can do in Haskell. Using typedef tuple<double, double> FloatPoint and taking it from there seems a lot more like the Haskell example and would be less code - one line each for the typedefs and a one-line function to implement <<.

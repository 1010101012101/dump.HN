I was maybe posting to a category with a lot of fraud in it so they made me? Anyway, now every time I post the process STARTS as an accountless posting, but ends up linked to my account.<p>It ends up not saving any steps. I create a posting, get a POST/EDIT/DELETE email, click that, log in using my username/password (or more realistically: reset my password, then log in).<p>Craigslist&#x27;s accountless posting is a great thing, but managing a hybrid approach as they have ended up having to do seems messy and confusing for those of us who get accounts.",1392256779

With severely depleted military horde, USA reinstates draft.  Most potential draftees move to Canada; Canadian militia now outnumbers American Army.  USA can&#x27;t drop nukes a few miles from its own border; besides, Exxon needs that tar sands oil.  Canadian militia considers remodeling White House again.  Harper declares the militia illegal; Canadian civil war breaks out.

7228843,comment,7228531,7228531,3,0,Spittie,,,"Password prompts are annoying, agreed.<p>I like the idea of delaying it as long as possible, even if sometimes it gets annoying. If I have to go through several steps just to register to a site, then I&#x27;ll probably not register.<p>But remember that e-mail is not a secure protocol. Anyone could be sniffing your traffic to find a random generated password, an url that automatically log you in, and similar content.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a solution based on certificates, like how ssh works. Your browser and the server agree on a key pair over a secure (https?) connection, and then you use it to login.<p>This add a whole layer of complications to the browser, like how you sync those, take them into another browser ecc... But it would sure be a very cool way to totally remove the password prompt, while staying secure.<p>By the way, Amazon ask for my password every time I try to place an order, even if it&#x27;s with a saved credit card and with on a registered address.

But, based on <i>your initial description</i>, Stradivari simply loved making instruments. He sold them only to make a living so that he could continue.<p>That&#x27;s far different from a &quot;mission&quot; of simply &quot;creating great products that people love&quot;, then mass producing them for sale.<p>But, you&#x27;ve kind of morphed your description of Stradivari now to make him sound more like a capitalist than a guy with a hobby who simply sold some of his creations out of sheer necessity.<p>So, whichever story you want to go with determines the &quot;column&quot; in which Stradivari belongs. Either way, my point is that there <i>are</i> two columns. However, if you think the difference is immaterial and my suggestion amounts to sophistry, then I can agree to disagree. I&#x27;ve pretty much given my best effort at clarifying what I believe is the distinction.<p>><i>This would not be possible without a organizational structure (corporation) that incentivizes them to work together</i><p>I completely disagree, but I don&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s relevant to the point I was trying to make which is, again, that making a product in itself is not a &quot;mission&quot; that distinguishes a company/person&#x27;s purpose from any other profit-seeking company/person&#x27;s purpose.",1392256509
7228836,comment,7227820,7228573,1,0,peterkelly,,,"Clinical depression is often a result not of one&#x27;s external environment or social situation, but a chemical imbalance in the brain (Serotonin in particular). I&#x27;m certainly no expert on the topic, but from what I know science still doesn&#x27;t have a definitive answer to what brings such an imbalance about. Also it is sometimes hereditary.<p>External factors (financial/relationship problems and the other various pressures of life) can contribute to the problem and either be a trigger for or worsen the symptoms. But there are many instances in which someone who is otherwise successful and happy with things in general (as it sounds like this man was) can suffer from it.

7228830,comment,7222129,7222851,4,0,STRML,,,"I spent a while looking at it last night and came up with a solution, I&#x27;ll walk you through it. For reference, here&#x27;s the code:<p><pre><code>    function escape(s) {\n      // Bonus level!\n\n      Object.defineProperty(console, &#x27;foo&#x27;, \n         { get : function() { throw &#x27;nooo!&#x27; } });\n\n      var code = &#x27;with(window.console && console.foo || {}) {\\n\\t&#x27;+s+&#x27;\\n}&#x27;;\n      console.log(code);\n\n      try {\n        console.log(eval(code));\n      } catch (e) {\n        console.log(e);\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe idea is, you need to craft `s`, such that `s` can execute arbitrary code without throwing &#x27;nooo!&#x27;.\nThe interesting problem is, any access to `console.foo` with throw because the getter above is called. This <i>includes the access inside the `with` statement</i>. So the solution, if there is any, must\nsomehow cause mutation of state before the `with` even executes.<p>Now, what brought me to the solution was this thought: &quot;What in Javascript allows you to execute code <i>before</i>\na given statement?&quot; Upon framing it in this way, the solution became immediately clear: function declarations are automatically hoisted!<p>If you redefine `console` to be an object without the property &#x27;foo&#x27;, the `|| {}` part of the with predicate will\ninstead be passed as the scope, and you have free reign to walk about the system.<p>So the solution is:<p><pre><code>    alert(1) } function console(){} {\n</code></pre>\nWhich produces the statement:<p><pre><code>    with(window.console && console.foo || {}) { \n      alert(1) } function console(){} {\n    }</code></pre>",1392256259

Even without any of the larger tech companies participating we generated about as fifth as many calls as SOPA (400k). We also lacked a call to action as defeating a pending bill that would jeopardize internet freedom.<p>Why didn&#x27;t larger tech companies didn&#x27;t take part? I think that&#x27;s an interesting question worth a journalist investigating.  As with SOPA, companies like Google left their decision until the last minute. But this time around they decided to support the protest, but not take part by adding content to their home pages. I&#x27;m not sure any one thing explains it. Larger tech has added a significant lobbying apparatus since 2011 and perhaps that&#x27;s part of it. They&#x27;re playing the inside political game much more so than they did a couple of years ago. If it turns out to be more effective that online activism, I&#x27;m not sure we can particularly criticize them for it.<p>They&#x27;ve also banded together on this issue under the &quot;reformgovernmentsurveillance.com&quot; banner.

I repeat it here so you realise what I&#x27;m arguing and what statement you made earlier.<p>Secondly you grossly misrepresent what I say with the first few sentences of your reply which makes me worry about whether you paused to give any thought to what I said or just decided to be argumentative and pick out random words you disliked. Nonetheless I&#x27;ll go through your points.<p>>You claim cigarate bans helped tobacco industry?<p>No I claimed ADVERTISING bans on cigarettes helped the companies by reducing expenses related to competition between cigarette companies. I also claimed that outside of the industry it had other positive effects. However you will have noticed the quotes around &quot;better&quot; in &#x27; &quot;better&quot; for the public&#x27; because I felt I should qualify that a non smoker generally costs the health system more by living longer.<p>> CFC helped grow corporations?<p>I&#x27;m sorry, perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have assumed you knew what CFCs are and why they are relevant to the conversation. CFC are a widely useful range of chemical compounds that were used in a great many products, they also deplete the ozone layer. The regulation of CFCs which phased out their use is an example where government intervention was required and the free market solution of localized profits failed. I have no data on whether it helped grow corporations, it is however known that the requlations reduced the amount of CFCs in the atmosphere which led to the shrinking of the hole in the ozone layer.<p>>Because if all you are saying is that regulation is destroying industries, well that&#x27;s actually my point.<p>You&#x27;re the one that&#x27;s taken the hardline position of saying that centralized solutions never work better than pure free market and as I reject your reframing of better to be only industry, I am pointing out that centralized/regulated solutions do work better in some cases. Even if I didn&#x27;t reject your definition of industrial production as the basis for better, wartime america with centralized planing on production was a &#x27;better&#x27; idea than the free market system it had before it, being much more productive.<p>>And yes the...<p>It may have been cheap and affordable but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone was getting it, in fact that&#x27;s the reason the government stepped in. So sure the system got screwed up by regulation, because it was the wrong regulation, they should have gone whole hog on the nationilization like the other countries and then the US would have a better system. (And by better I mean has a positive effect on the the most peoples lives, not maximises the money spent on basic healthcare, or the total wealth of the &quot;healthcare industry&quot;)<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve persuaded you that your original statement about the free market system always being the best system is an untenable position. If you still disagree could you explain to me how a system without regulation deals with atomic weapons. (Now a flippant question because I really would believe it to be absurd to hold to the unregulated premise at this point (I hope you realise I&#x27;m poking fun at the premise not you)) Do they always go to the highest bidder cash wise or do they only sell them if there&#x27;s a sales contract not to blow up the seller... and whatever court the breach of contract trial would be held in?",1392254762

The most common standard is: when it obtains p>.05. I begin here by evaluating this standard in the context of three published replication attempts, involving investigations of the embodiment of morality, the endowment effect, and weather effects on life satisfaction, concluding the standard has unacceptable problems. I then describe similarly unacceptable problems associated with standards that rely on effect-size comparisons between original and replication results. Finally, I propose a new standard: Replication attempts fail when their results indicate that the effect, if it exists at all, is too small to have been detected by the original study. This new standard (1) circumvents the problems associated with existing standards, (2) arrives at intuitively compelling interpretations of existing replication results, and (3) suggests a simple sample size requirement for replication attempts: 2.5 times the original sample.&quot;",1392254175

There&#x27;s definitely some kind of mood swing component that seems entirely biological; regardless of whether things are going well in life or not, there are periods of between a week and sometimes as long as a month where I simply have difficulty getting up in the morning, focusing, socializing, and maintaining healthy habits like regular exercise. Usually my sugar consumption skyrockets when this happens and I keep bad hours and the cycle feeds into itself.<p>Then there seems to be a slightly greater sensitivity to problems. Outwardly, I can power through a lot of problems -- financial trouble, management, work, personal life stuff, whatever -- but inwardly, it kills me a little bit.<p>Annoyingly, other people&#x27;s problems bother me a lot too, extending all the way out to sociological issues. I think this is part of what created David Foster Wallace&#x27;s famous speech, &quot;This is Water&quot; (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI</a>) -- he eventually committed suicide. But this can also be a strength, it&#x27;s what drives me to try to make a difference.<p>Anyway, the real trouble begins when I&#x27;m in a biological downswing <i>and</i> things in life start getting really hard. In a single year, I lost most of my friends over a disagreement, my parents both had serious issues (and I was their counselor for much of it), my business was struggling, and the effort I had put into training for search and rescue all Summer got wasted when the vehicle I was driving died on the way up to the final exam. It was just a lot of stuff all at once, so when the mood problems hit, I barely functioned at all for about a month.<p>The only common theme that I think I&#x27;ve found so far among people who struggle with depression is a feeling that nobody cares about them, or that they&#x27;re undervalued in some really big way. Struggling with depression is challenging; struggling with it <i>alone</i> is extremely difficult.<p>On the other hand, because of the social stigma it currently carries, few people want to make a big deal of depression when they&#x27;re struggling with it.<p>So, if you think you know someone who&#x27;s having trouble with it, it can sometimes help them a lot to just initiate contact and suggest spending just a little bit of time doing something they enjoy: a card game, going out for a bit, watching TV, whatever.

The problem is when they can put pressure to not write of unjust acts that may conflict with their interests. The solution is to provide founding from large enough group of people when there is no dominant subgroup. Models has to be highly distributed to avoid bribing users[1]. There needs to be upper limit of funding e.g. 99$ or 10%[2] to dilute influence of a single user. Even better for a 5$ a month I can get credit which I can allocate.<p>@2 Log everything.

Unfortunately it looks like the project site is down for the count.<p>As for the rest, it seems very confined to the use of Python as a web programming language, if you try to use many web languages in domains outside of the web you will be writing a lot of things from scratch. Python has multiple competitive web offerings but they form part of a huge landscape of offerings in many areas few can match. I&#x27;d go so far as to say the top two languages for &quot;is there a B+ or higher viable library for this random task&quot; would be Python and Java. Clojure&#x27;s promise is to swiftly address the flaw in all other Lisps by incorporating the Java ecosystem.<p>Programming language research gets an order of magnitude more coverage on HN than it does inside Computer Science as a discipline.

I&#x27;ve never intentionally tried the kind of deduction that you describe, but at least for me and my circle of friends, I can see it easily falling apart just a few steps in. Plenty of stores carry soy milk nowadays, not just vegetarian ones. I can&#x27;t possibly hope to know all the restaurants where my friends live. Most of my friends who cook at home get by with dull knives and ancient cookware. And not only do I have no idea which stores sell kitchen supplies, but it&#x27;s not always obvious whether someone does their shopping in person or on Amazon. This is especially the case for hobbies and activities I&#x27;m less familiar with, such as yoga.<p>I suppose if I had meticulous knowledge of my area and practiced a lot, I could get my guesses above 50%. But it seems like something I&#x27;d have to put a lot of effort in, not a skill I would just acquire casually.<p>Do you find that this comes easily to you?<p>(I&#x27;m not saying that figuring things out about people is impossible, of course. It makes sense to divide up the probability space and increase your odds. Again with your coffee example, you could probably make a reasonable educated guess that the person is vegetarian, or even that they cook at home. But where they shop? Where they eat? There&#x27;s so many choices these days, and people like trying new things. Even if I had a hunch, I <i>certainly</i> couldn&#x27;t outright tell them with specificity about all their consumer habits, like you described with your coworker. The probability of me being right would just be way too low.)<p>I appreciate you posting here, it&#x27;s pretty interesting to read.",1392253428

I&#x27;ll focus on the mechanic analogy, but I do think the premise of the article is flawed. I have some thoughts about burnout in programmers etc. but they aren&#x27;t well enough formed for a 1am UK time post...<p>I actually think the analogy of car mechanic is really appropriate. Many people (myself included) could not fix even the most trivial of problems. I have fixed some very very trivial problems by poking around / research, but as a general rule the car has just gone into the garage, and <i>someone else has fixed it for me</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve also once had a car in the garage for over a week. I briefly mentioned the problem, over the phone, to my non-mechanical grandmother, only to have her diagnose <i>exactly</i> the issue at hand. Simply: She has had the same thing happen to one of her cars. Those mechanics hadn&#x27;t seen it. So she was correct. But that anecdote doesn&#x27;t really mean anything. It was just one of those things. Experts can&#x27;t know everything and those car mechanics will always know more than my gran about cars!<p>&#x27;So at the end of several days&#x27; worth of programming, and problem-solving, and forward-thinking, all a programmer might get is a &quot;thanks, now here&#x27;s the next thing I need you to do.&quot;&#x27; - yes!

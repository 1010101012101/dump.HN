2977618,comment,2977449,2977449,8,0,davidhollander,,,"I'm a big fan of Lua and Go's use of multiple return values, nil, and simplified error handling, (No exception 'types'). I think the problem with 'typing' Exceptions is that it means you are using it to record and pass describable\\known state similar to return, instead of being reserved for unknown state. For indicating predictable failure states without using exceptions, I think multiple return values as used in Go and Lua is a much better paradigm. To recap Steve's post, opening a non-existent file in Lua:<p><pre><code>    =io.open 'sdfasdf'\n    nil\tsdfasdf: No such file or directory\t2\n</code></pre>\nThe first value returned is nil, the 2nd value is a string containing an error message, and the 3rd is an integer error code. This allows you to write most code using 2 state boolean logic:<p><pre><code>    f=io.open 'sasdasdfsf'\n    if f then -- nil is a boolean 0\n</code></pre>\nwhereas in Python, one often has to reason about 3 states due to the use of try\\except blocks. Even though you are not using typed Exceptions, multiple return values does not discard any state about the error if it is desired:<p><pre><code>    f, err = io.open 'sasdasd'\n    print(err)\n</code></pre>\nIn Lua (not Go), when you combine multiple return values with an assert() function of the form assert(boolean, error_message), you effectively get a mechanism for making exceptions optional:<p><pre><code>    > =assert(io.open 'sdfasdf')\n    stdin:1: sdfasdf: No such file or directory\n    stack traceback:\n    \t[C]: in function 'assert'\n    \tstdin:1: in main chunk\n    \t[C]: ?\n</code></pre>\nAlthough Go does not appear to include assertions at all, arguing against them in its FAQ: <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html#assertions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html#assertions</a>",1315565085

Everyone can run their own server.  No 1 company has complete control over it.

If the person has unsubscribed, but there was no notification, an 'unsubscribe' response is returned, instead of accepting the message.<p>As far as I've thought it through, this means nobody can send you spam unless you are subscribed to them.  No companies can monetize you, unless you use their server instead of running your own.  With a set of standardized protocols, it should be possible to create twitter-like clients that hook to any server running this...<p>It doesn't have to be limited to 140 characters.

Replies can be threaded, instead of hoping the other person knows why you are replying.<p>There's some other things to think about, such as what happens when a server is offline for a while.  Does it poll everyone to try to catch up?  Do servers send messages in batches back and forth, instead of dealing with things on a user-by-user basis?  etc etc.",1315564515

Making Emacs look pretty involves installing color-theme, hopefully compiling it so it doesn't take forever to load, editing your .emacs.d/init.el since you can't customize that via customize-apropos (AFAIK), and so on.  Likewise, I'm with you that the default regex implementation is...surreal, at best. Having reb-re-syntax be 'string should be the default.<p>On the bright side, look at what we're discussing here: the default regex syntax and pretty colors.  Compare that to about five years ago, when we'd be instead discussing how to compile Emacs in a way that had fricking TrueType font support.  Emacs <i>has</i> come a long way.",1306504795

It's more tax-efficient for starters, and also more likely to attract like-minded people to contribute resources (time and/or money).<p>Open-Source projects for example are often clearly ""not for profit"" and incorporate, or align themselves with not-for-profit structures. The FSF, Mozilla foundation and a score of others spring to mind.<p>For the small businessmen you know, who do not care about the money (beyond their salary), who are out to build a legacy, they _should not_ use a business structure. If they do, well that still doesn't make them a ""business"".<p>If they're aiming to start from scratch, and create a giant business, so they have ""succeeded"" (think Hewlett, Packard, Johnson, Ford et al) then that creation still serves the needs of the owner - those needs are just not cash. It might be good for customers along the way, but the business exists for the owners' glory, not the customers.<p>Of course the vast majority of small businesses are absolutely, 100%, businesses. A small business may fit a person better than a big business, but it's still a business. If you take away the money aspect from most small businesses, they close their doors.<p>It's exactly like the OP said - the business exists to fulfill the needs of the owner and the team (if there is a team). Those needs are usually cash, but include other things like flexible hours, and not-having-a-boss and so on. When the needs of the customer clash with the needs of the business, the business always wins.<p>And of course there are _bad_ business people out there. There are those that will take calls at 1am because the customer demands it (so they say) but they don't place a value on it, or require the customer to pay that value. That's bad business, and of course it's very common. But you can't use that as a data point for arguing that businesses exist for the benefit of customers. Some owners even use their relative lack of success as evidence of their altruism. In which case recommend to them that they start a charity, get a board to oversee their salary, and get out of the way.",1306504686

Such use is exempt from these new regulations anyway.<p>I find it interesting that you have such a strong view about regulations that require some trivial effort on the part of legitimate businesses, while at the same time having no problem with a business model that is fundamentally built on harassing all users and making their browsing experience worse. How is your position not hypocritical?<p>> You're preventing people from doing business one way not because it's wrong, but simply because you find it distasteful.<p>While you, on the other hand, are suggesting there is nothing wrong with a busines model based on practices that consumers widely dislike but currently cannot do anything about.<p>The reason we have consumer protection laws is precisely so consumers win and abusive businesses lose in this sort of situation, and while I question the details of these new regulations, I see nothing wrong with the principle behind them.",1306504655

I feel the author's missing the point.<p>In the case of language, observing and reporting statistical probabilities in written/spoken language output does very little to explain the cognitive systems used in acquiring and using language.  Even one statistical anomaly serves to show that statistical learning is NOT the entire picture when it comes to language development.<p>There was another article on HN a while back that had another great quote from Chomsky that does well to illustrate what I feel is his main point here: ""Fooling people into mistaking a submarine for a whale doesn't show that submarines really swim; nor does it fail to establish the fact"".  Creating a computer that can produce millions of grammatical utterances does little to show that we understand language systems.  Now, if a computer could - like humans - <i>learn</i> to produce infinite, novel, contextual, and meaningful grammatical utterances, that's a different story.  But that story will take a lot more than statistical learning to write.",1306504577

And you have their consent. You've given them the option to make an informed choice. Your duty has been performed.<p>> Third, the regulation completely forbids a potential business model built around targeted advertising.<p>It forbids potential business models built around targeted advertising not based on visitor knowledge and consent (so it forbids business models that wilfully violate the privacy of site visitors without their knowledge, and without their consent). Again, if users don't care (as you point out), the gaining of consent isn't going to be an issue, so these business models will retain their viability.<p>So given your statement that users don't care about third party tracking or profiling, none of what you outline are really issues.",1306504493

I see this a lot: those who view access as a mere possession go nowhere; those who view access as a means to an end advance. This, in the popular discussions of how to aid the poor, is woefully under-addressed - probably because for all the things you can do for someone (and feel good about doing), the one critical core factor is self-motivation: you can't make someone do what they need to for their own good.<p>This nation provides tremendous access to networks and other opportunities for the poor. Maybe not unlimited access to the top networks from the bottom (the classic ""can't afford Harvard"" red herring), but there is more than enough access to get out of poverty. The funding is there, the doors are open, the paths are clear, assistance is eager - but if someone won't take the steps that only they themselves can take, they won't get anywhere.<p>I see stark examples of this over and over.

Why is the moon at the right distance to provide a gentle tide, and exert a stabilizing effect on earth's axis of rotation, thus protecting life here? Why does gravity work the way it does? Why does anything at all exist rather than not exist? O'Reilly is correct that these questions can only be addressed by mythmaking, religion or philosophy, not by science.<p>Science doesn't really aim to answer the 'why'-questions, but rather the 'how'-questions. The scientific method boils down to falsifying hypothesis, and it's a lot easier with 'how does the tide work?' than 'why does the tide work (the way it does)?'.<p>Science can't say anything about 'Why does anything at all exist rather than not exist?', because there is no way to test any of the answers.

To me, that clearly falls under the ""strictly necessary"" banner<p>They say that, but it is easily demonstrable that running a web site providing static content such as they do does not require the use of any cookies or similar technology at all to provide the service the user is requesting: millions of web sites manage it every day. As you say, if only part of their site requires the cookie for some genuine reason, perhaps they should only set it there. In any case, there is really no excuse for not explaining properly what the cookie is for or for cluttering up the screens of visitors who don't check your ""do whatever you want"" button just to make the extra panel go away.<p>Bottom line: the exemption is not for cookies that are required because you hired poorly trained web developers or picked an inconvenient tool somewhere on your hosting platform.

(There were a lot more Luna missions in total, some were not supposed to try soft-landing, and some failed to even reach Moon orbit.)<p>For those who are interested in Space trivia:<p>According to Wikipedia[0], Luna 2 intentionally crasheded into the Moon, making it the first human-made object to land on it. Luna 5, 7, 8 failed to soft-land, making Luna 9 the first object to soft-land on the Moon. Luna 10, 11, 12 and 14 were designed to orbit the Moon and crash into it after they failed. Luna 13 successfully landed on the Moon.<p>Luna 15 was supposed to bring back soil samples, but it crashed into the Moon as well. (More space race trivia: It was supposed to bring back lunar soil samples before Apollo 11 returned to Earth. Armstrong and Aldrin were on the surface of the Moon when Luna 15 impacted.)<p>Luna 16 was the first unmanned probe to successfully land on the Moon and return a soil sample (which is an event even rarer than manned moon landings).<p>Luna 17, which carried the Lunokhod 1 roboter mentioned in the artcile landed successfully as well.<p>Luna 18 (another planned soil return) crashed, Luna 19 successfully orbited the Moon for a year and later crashed into the Moon.<p>Luna 21 also soft-landed carrying Lunokhod 2, the second roboter mentioned in the article.<p>Luna 22 and Luna 23 were also soil return probes, but Luna 22 crashed and Luna 23 damaged the return probe on landing (the landing was a soft-landing though).<p>Luna 20 and 24 both successfully landed on the Moon and returned to Earth with soil samples, making Luna 24 the last man-made object to return from the Moon to Earh.<p>0: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_man-made_objects_on_the_Moon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_man-made_objects_on_the...</a>",1306503528

Funny, earlier this evening I stumbled over an interview with Tony Schwartz (the author of the parent article) and David Allen, from 'Getting Things Done', in the print version of HBR.<p>I follow many of the advices, they make, already and they work great but many others I keep struggling to make a ritual.<p>1) Morning Workout: Takes time, especially on days where I have to commute a lot. Sure, I can make a good 5 minute workout but if I have to leave a lot earlier than my usual sleep cycle I don't even want to take that time. I might even decide to only shower the night before and hence can't afford a real work out before jumping in my clothes. Also, I found that I'm often significantly more tired over the whole day when I do a hard morning workout. I have plenty of experience of this from my time in the military. Sure, I should probably do a lighter workout. But I rather have a real workout later than wasting time on some wishi-washi with Homeopathic weights. And real, strenght workout requires full concentration and an awake mind.<p>2) Sleep Cycle:\nIn winter, I usually succeed on this and I love the benefits. But now that the days are long its hard to enjoy a social life and still get up early. So I do get up early only when I have to and stay up late when its worth it. Not very healthy but a lot more fun.<p>3) Planing the day ahead: I would love to make it a ritual to decide the night before what is going to be the most important task tomorrow. Sometimes, I do, but tonight for instance I fail. I worked in ""the zone"" for hours, stopped at midnight. Now, instead of making that decision, write it down and then go to sleep, I'm procrastinating here for more than an hour. I guess, I'm afraid to take the step back to look at the whole task - which is huge for me - and get mentally destroyed by the weight of that challenge. Whereas, if just keep writing tomorrow where I stopped, I might not work on the most important thing, but at least I get something done.<p>Any thoughts or suggestions?",1306503516

This value comes primarily from increased productivity.<p>Understanding just how much the Internet contributes to national economies should spur government and business leaders to seek ways to optimize their participation in the global Internet ecosystem.
